Introduction

[1] This is an appeal by the Appellant by way of a case stated against the

determination of the Tax Appeals Commission dated 14.02.2017

confirming the determination made by the Respondent on 15.10.2010 and

dismissing the Appeal of the Appellant. The period relates to the years of

assessment 2005/2006 and 2006/2007.

Factual Background

[2] The Appellant is a limited liability Company incorporated in Sri Lanka

and engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling of plastic items.

In addition to the principal activity of the Company, it is engaged in the

business of share trading in public listed Companies in Sri Lanka.

[3] The Appellant has submitted the return of income for the above year of assessment and claimed a deduction of the interest expenses of Rs. 52,479,392 and Rs. 150,015,560/- respectively against its profits for the purposes of calculating its income tax liability. The Assessor refused to grant a deduction of part of the aforesaid interest expenses on the following grounds:

1. Interest expenses related to share trading activities of the Appellant

have been financed through interest bearing loans and the interest

expenses incurred in its share trading activities have been charged

to the profit and loss account of its principal business of

manufacturing and selling plastic items;

2. The Appellant has made investment in shares of other Companies

and granted loans without interest to the Chairman/Directors of the Company through interest bearing loans and thus, such interest expenses related to investment and loans to Chairman/Directors are

3

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

not allowed as a deduction from the business of manufacturing and selling plastic items in terms of Section 23 read with Section 24 (1) (g) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 (as amended).

[4] Accordingly, the Assessor adjusted profit/assessable income for the

years of assessment 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 as follows:

2005/06

Bank Loans and overdrafts (As per audited statements of accounts)

540,880,423

Loan granted to chairman/directors) 200,000.000

Investment in shares of other companies 375,723,437 575,723,437

Interest expenses 52,479,392

Y/A 2005/06

Adjusted Profit/Assessable income as your computation 137,317,103

Add

Disallowable interest 52,479,103

Adjusted Profit/Assessable income 189,796,206

2006/07

Bank Loans and overdrafts (As per audited statements of accounts)

1,719,658,881

Loan granted to chairman/directors) 220,000.000

Investment in shares of other companies 1,183,172,223 1,403,172,223

Interest expenses 150,015,560

Y/A 2006/07

Adjusted Profit/Assessable income as your computation 49,798,643

Add

Disallowable interest 1,403,172,223 x 150,015,560 122,406,640

1,719,568,881

Adjusted Profit/Assessable income 172,205,283

[5] Accordingly, the notices of assessment were issued by the Assessor and

being dissatisfied with the said assessments, the Appellant appealed to the

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter referred to as the

4

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Respondent) and the Respondent by its determination dated 15.10.2010

confirmed the assessment and dismissed the appeal (Vide- reasons for the

determination at pp. 1-5 of the Tax Appeals Commission brief).

Appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission & the Court of Appeal

[6] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Respondent, the

Appellant appealed to the Board of Review and with the establishment of

the Tax Appeals Commission, the said appeal was transferred to the Tax

Appeals Commission.

[7] The Tax Appeals Commission held in its determination that (i) the

Appellant is engaged in two separate business activities, namely

manufacturing of plastic items; and (ii) the Appellant conducted a share

trading business by regularly purchasing and selling shares and thus, it is

not a case of making investments in shares for the purpose of obtaining

dividends; (iii) deduction of interest expenses incurred in its share trading

activities should deducted from the profits received from the share trading

activities and not from the income received from the main business of the

Appellant; (iv) since the interest received from share trading activities can

be deducted under Section 23 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 or

Section 25 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, Sections 29 of the

Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 or Section 32 of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 of 2006 cannot be applied. Accordingly, the Tax Appeals Commission

by its determination dated 14.02.2017 confirmed the determination of the

Respondent and dismissed the Appeal.

Questions of Law

[8] Being dissatisfied with the said determination of the Tax Appeals

Commission, the Appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal by way of a

Case Stated and formulated the following questions of law in the Case

Stated for the opinion of the Court of Appeal.

1. Was the Tax Appeals Commission functus officio to make a

decision on the appeal in view of Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011, as amended?

5

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

2. Was the interest incurred by the Appellant to the value of Rupees

52,479,103 which was disallowed by the CGIR an expense which is

deductible in determining the profits from the trade of the

Appellant for the Year of Assessment 2005/2006 in terms of

Section 23 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000?

3. Was the interest incurred by the Appellant to the value of Rupees

122,406,640 which was disallowed by the CGIR an expense which

is deductible in determining the profits from the trade of the

Appellant for the Year of Assessment 2006/2007 in terms of

Section 25 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006?

4. Has the Tax Appeals Commission erroneously and wrongfully

disregarded the specific evidence with regard to the payment of

interest for the Years of Assessment 2005/2006 and 2006/2007

which entitled the Appellant to deductibility of such interest in

terms of Section 29(2) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000

and Section 32 (5) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006?

5. In the alternative to (2) above, was the interest incurred by the

Appellant to the value of Rupees 52,479,103 deductible in

determining the assessable income of the Appellant for the Year

of Assessment 2005/2006 in terms of Section 29 (2) of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006?

6. In the alternative to (3) above, was the interest incurred by the

Appellant to the value of Rupees 122,406,640 deductible in

determining the assessable income of the Appellant for the Year

of Assessment 2006/2007 in terms of Section 32 (5) of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006?

7. Notwithstanding the above, was the basis used by the CGIR in

arriving at the interest expenses attributable to the investment

(share trading) business of the Appellant erroneous in law?

[9] At the hearing of the appeal, Mr. F.N. Goonewardena, the learned

Counsel for the Appellant and Dr. Charuka Ekanayake, State Counsel for

the Respondent made extensive oral submissions on the seven questions

of law submitted for the opinion of the Court

6

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Analysis

Question of Law, No. 1

Is the determination made by the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?

[10] At the hearing, Mr. Goonewardena submitted that after all appeals

pending before the Board of Review were transferred to the Tax Appeals

Commission in terms of Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No.

23 of 2011, the Tax Appeals Commission was required to decide such

appeals within a period of 180 days from the date of such transfer, but in

terms of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 04 of 2012,

this period was extended to 12 months from the date on which the

Commission shall commence its sittings. He further submitted that this

period was further extended by the Tax Appeals Commission

(Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 to 24 months from the date on which the

Commission shall commence its sittings for the hearing of each such

appeal, which makes it very clear that the intention of Parliament is that

Section 10 (as amended), is a mandatory provision of law which requires

strict compliance.

[11] Mr. Goonewardena submitted that the appeal was first heard by the

Commission on 17.10.2013 but the determination was made by the

Commission on 14.02.2017, which is clearly beyond the time period

specified by the Tax Appeals Commission Act and accordingly, the

determination of the appeal by the Tax Appeals Commission was time

barred by operation of law. He relied on the decision of the Court of Appeal

in Mohideen v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue ((CA 2/2007 (20-

15) Vol. XXI. BASL Law Journal, page 170) in support of his contention.

[12] On the other hand, the learned State Counsel submitted that the time

limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act (as

amended) is not mandatory, but rather directory and the failure to adhere

to the time limit specified in the Tax Appeals Commission Act (as amended)

cannot render the Tax Appeals Commission functus officio to hear and

determine the appeal. He relied on the decisions of this Court in Stafford

Motor Company Limited v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(CA /Tax/17/2017, decided on 15.03.2019), Kegalle Plantations PLC v.

7

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CA/Tax/09/2010) decided on

04.09.2018, S.P. Muttiah v Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(CA/Tax/46/2019) decided on 30.07.2021 in support of his contention.

[13] It is common ground that the initial appeal was made by the Appellant

to the Board of Review in terms of the provisions of the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 38 of 2000, and in terms of proviso to Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011, all appeals pending before the Board of

Review were deemed to stand transferred to the Tax Appeals Commission.

Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011, stipulated

that the Tax Appeals Commission shall make the determination within a

period of one hundred and eighty days from the date of the

commencement of the hearing of the appeal. It reads as follows:

The Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its decision in respect thereof, within one hundred and eighty days from the date of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal.

[14] The proviso to Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23

of 2011 reads as follows:

Provided that. All appeals pending before the respective Board or Boards of Review in terms of the provisions of the respective enactments specified in the schedule to this Act, shall with effect from the date of coming into operation of the provision of this Act be deemed to stand transferred to the Commission and the Commission shall make its decision in respect thereof, within hundred and eighty days from the date of such transfer notwithstanding anything contained in any other written law.

[15] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act was amended by

Section 7 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012,

which stipulated that the determination of the Commission shall be made

within two hundred and seventy days. Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act was further amended by Section 7 of the Tax Appeals

Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012 by the substitution of the

words within hundred and eighty days from the date of such transfer of

the words within twelve months of the date on which the Commission

shall commence its sittings. This Amendment came into effect on

8

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

15.02.2012 and pending appeals were transferred to the Tax Appeals

Commission from the Board of Review. In terms of Section 13 of the said

Act, the amendment was to have retrospective effect and was deemed to

have come into force from the date of the Principal Act (i.e. 31.01.2011).

[16] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, no 23 of 2011 was

further amended by Section 7 of the Tax Appeals Commission

(Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 by the substitution for all the words

commencing from two hundred and seventy days to the end of that

Section, of the following: -

Two hundred and seventy days from the date of the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal

Provided that, all appeals pending before the respective Board or Boards of Review in terms of the provisions of the respective enactments specified in Column I of Schedule I, or Schedule II to this Act, notwithstanding the fact that such provisions are applicable to different taxable periods as specified therein shall with effect from the date of coming into operation of the provision of this Act be deemed to stand transferred to the Commission, and the Commission shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any other written law make its determination in respect thereof, within twenty four months from the date on which the Commission shall commence its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal..

[17] In terms of Section 14 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment)

Act, No. 20 of 2013, the amendment was to have retrospective effect and

was deemed to have come into force with effect from 01.04.2011. Section

15 of the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013

further provides an avoidance of doubt clause as follows:

For the avoidance of doubts, it is hereby declared, that the Commission shall have the power in accordance with the provisions of the principal enactment as amended by this Act, to hear and determine any appeal that was deemed transferred to the Commission under section 10 of the principal enactment, notwithstanding the expiry of the twelve months granted for its determination by that section prior to its amendment by this Act.

9

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

[18] Accordingly, Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of

2011 as last amended by the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act,

No. 20 of 2013 now provides as follows:

The Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its determination in respect thereof, within two hundred and seventy days from the date of the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal: Provided that, all appeals pending before the respective Board or Boards of Review in terms of the provisions of the respective enactments specified in Column I of Schedule I, or Schedule II to this Act, notwithstanding the fact that such provisions are applicable to different taxable periods as specified therein shall with effect from the date of coming into operation of the provision of this Act be deemed to stand transferred to the Commission, and the Commission shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other written law make its determination in respect thereof, within twenty four months from the date on which the Commission shall commence its sittings for the hearing of each such appeal.

Mandatory vs. Directory

[19] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act stipulates that the Tax

Appeals Commission shall make its determination within 270 days from

the date of the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of the appeal.

Superficially, the effects of non-compliance of a provision are dealt with in

terms of the mandatory-directory classification. Generally, in case of a

mandatory provision, the act done in breach thereof is void, whereas, in

case of a directory provision, the act does not become void, although some

other consequences may follow (P.M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes,

First Ed, 2008422).

[20] The argument advanced by Mr. Goonewardena was that the word

"shall used in Section 10 is normally to be interpreted as connoting a

mandatory provision, meaning that what is thereby enjoined is not merely

desired (directory) to be done but must be done (mandatory). Thus, he

submitted that the effect of such breach of a mandatory provision, which

has the consequence of the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission

rendering invalid. But, the use of the word shall does not always mean

that the provision is obligatory or mandatory as it depends upon the

10

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

context in which the word shall occurs, and the other circumstances as

echoed by the Indian Supreme Court case of The Collector of Monghyr v.

Keshan Prasad Goenka, AIR 1962 SC 1694 at p. 1701) in the following

words:

It is needless to add that the employment of the auxiliary verb " shall" is inconclusive and similarly the mere absence of the imperative is not conclusive either. The question whether any requirement is mandatory or directory has to be decided, not merely on the basis of any specific provision which, for instance, sets out the consequence of the omission to observe the requirement, but on the purpose for which the requirement has been enacted, particularly in the context of the (1) [1958] S.C.R. 533, other provisions of the Act and the general scheme thereof. It would, inter alia, depend on whether the requirement is insisted on as a protection for the safeguarding of the right of liberty of a person or of property which the action might involve.

[21] Thus, an enactment in form is mandatory might, in substance be

directory and that the use of the word shall does not conclude the matter

(Hari Vishnu Kamath v. Ahmad Ishaque AIR 1955 SC 233). It is not in dispute

that Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act does not say what will

happen if the Tax Appeals Commission fails to make the determination

within the time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission

Act, No. 23 of 2011 as amended.

Legislative Intent

[22] The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory is a

question which has to be adjudged in the light of the intention of the

Legislature as disclosed by the object, purpose and scope of the statute. If

the statute is mandatory, the act or thing done not in the manner or form

prescribed can have no effect or validity and if it is a directory, a penalty

may be incurred for non-compliance, but the act or thing done is regarded

as good (P.M. Bakshi, Interpretation of Statutes, p. 430 & Mohanlal

Ganpatram v. Shri Sayaji Jubliee Cotton and Jute Mills Co. Ltd AIR 1966 Guj.

96). In State of U.P., v. Baburam Upadhya, reported in AIR 1961 SC 751, the

Supreme Court of India said that when a statute uses the word shall,

prima facie, it is mandatory, but the Court may ascertain the real intention

of the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute.

11

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

[23] Crawford on Statutory Construction (Ed. 1940, Art. 261, p. 516) sets

out the following passage from an American case approvingly as follows:

"The question as to whether a statute is mandatory or directory depends upon the intent of the legislature and not upon the language in which the intent is clothed. The meaning and intention of the legislature must govern, and these are to be ascertained, not only from the phraseology of the provision, but also by considering its nature, its design, and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other".

[24] According to Sutherland, Statutory Construction, Third Ed. Vol. III, p.

77:

The difference between mandatory and directory statutes is one of effect only. The question generally arises in a case involving a determination of rights as affected by the violation of, or omission to adhere to statutory directions. This determination involves a decision of whether or not the violation or omission is such as to render invalid Acts or proceedings to the statute, or the rights, powers, privileges claimed thereunder. If the violation or omission is invalidating, the statute is mandatory, if not, it is directory.

[25] Then the question is this: What is the fundamental test that is to be

applied in determining whether or not the failure to obey the time bar

provision in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act was intended

by the legislature to be mandatory or directory? The question whether the

non-compliance with a statutory provision can be classified as mandatory

rendering the proceedings invalid or directory leaving it intact depends, on

the consideration of whether the consequences of the non-compliance

were intended by the legislature to be mandatory or directory. This

proposition was echoed by Lord Woolf MR (as he then was) in R v.

Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Jeyeanthan [2000] 1 WLR

354, who stated that it is "much more important to focus on the

consequences of the non-compliance". He elaborated this proposition

in the following words at p. 360:

In the majority of cases, whether the requirement is categorized as directory or mandatory, the tribunal before whom the defect is properly raised has the task of determining what are to be the

12

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

consequences of failing to comply with the requirement in the context of all the facts and circumstances of the case in which the issue arises.

[26] Here, it is also desirable to remember the words of Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone L.C. in his speech in London and Clydeside Estates Ltd. v. Aberdeen District Council [1980] 1 W.L.R. 182 , 188190. He stated at p. 36:

"The contention was that in the categorization of statutory requirements into mandatory and directory, there was a subdivision of the category directory into two classes composed (I) of those directory requirements substantial compliance with which satisfied the requirement to the point at which a minor defect of trivial irregularity could be ignored by the court and (ii) those requirements so purely regulatory in character that failure to comply could in no circumstances affect the validity of what was done. When Parliament lays down a statutory requirement for the exercise of legal authority it expects its authority to be obeyed down to the minutest detail. But what the courts have to decide in a particular case is the legal consequence of non-compliance on the rights of the subject viewed in the light of a concrete state of facts and a continuing chain of events.

[27] In Howard and Others v. Bodington (1877) 2 PD 203, the Court of

Arches considered the question whether the consequences of a failure to

comply with a statutory requirement are mandatory or directory. Lord

Penzance stated at pp. 211-212:

Now the distinction between matters that are directory and matters that are imperative is well known to us all in the common language of the courts at Westminster. I am not sure that it is the most fortunate language that could have been adopted to express the idea that it is intended to convey; but still, that is the recognized language, and I propose to adhere to it. The real question in all these cases is this: A thing has been ordered by the legislature to be done. What is the consequence if it is not done? In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the

13

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the Court would take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end.

[28] In the absence of any express provision, the intention of the

legislature must be ascertained by weighing the consequences of holding

a statute to be directory or mandatory and having regard to the

importance of the provision in relation to the general object intended to

be secured by the Act (Caldow v. Pixcell (1877) 1 CPD 52, 566) & Dharendra

Kriisna v. Nihar Ganguly (AIR 1943 Cal. 266). As held in Attorney General's

Reference (No 3 of 1999), the emphasis ought to be on the consequences

of non-compliance, and asking the question whether Parliament can fairly

be taken to have intended total invalidity.

[29] Now the question is, to which category does Section 10 in this case

belong? The question as to whether Section 10 is mandatory or directory

depends on the intent of the legislature, and not upon its language,

irrespective of the fact that Section 10 is couched in language which refers

to the word shall. The intention of the legislature must be ascertained

not only from the phraseology of Section 10, but also by considering its

purpose, its design and more importantly, the consequences which would

follow from construing it one way of another.

[30] Again, the question is, what is the consequence of the failure to adhere

to the time limit specified in Section 10 that has been intended by the

legislature to be categorized as mandatory or directory. Accordingly, one

has to identify the tests to be applied in deciding whether a provision that

has been disregarded as mandatory or directory, and then applies them

to the statute which stipulates the determination shall be made within the

time limit specified therein, but makes no reference to any penal

consequences.

Consequence of non-compliance with a statutory provision

[31] In considering a procedural requirement from this angle, a court is

likely to construe it as mandatory if it seems to be of particular importance

in the context of the enactment, or if it is one of a series of detailed steps,

14

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

perhaps in legislation which has created a novel jurisdiction, (Warwick v.

White (1722) Bunb. 106; 145 E.R. 612) or if non-compliance might have

entailed penal consequences for one of the parties (State of Jammu and

Kashmir v. Abdul Ghani (1979) Ker LJ 46). Where the disobedience of a

provision is made penal, it can safely be said that such provision was

intended by the legislature to be mandatory (Seth Banarsi Das v. The Cane

Commissioner & Another, AIR 1955 All 86).

[32] As noted, the fact that no penal consequence is stated in a statute,

however, is only one factor to be considered towards a directory

construction, and there are other factors to be considered in determining

whether a provision of a Statute is mandatory or not. As noted, one of the

factors in determining whether the consequence of non-compliance

provision was intended by the legislature to be mandatory or directory is

to consider the broad purpose and object of the statute as Lord Penzance

stated in Howard v. Bodington (supra) at 211 as follows:

I believe, as far as any rule is concerned, you cannot safely go further than that in each case you must look into the subject-matter: consider the importance of the provision that has been disregarded, and the relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured by the Act; and upon a review of the case in that aspect decide whether the matter is what is called imperative or only directory.

[33] The legislature is a purposive act, and judges should construe statutes

to execute that legislative purpose, intent and context (Robert A.

Katzmann, Judging Statutes 31 (2014) by focusing on the legislative

process, taking into account the problem that the legislature was trying to

solve (Henry M. Hart, Jr. & Albert M. Sacks, The legal Process: Basic

Problems in the Making and Application of Law 1182 (William N. Eskridge,

Jr. & Phillip P. Frickey Eds., (1994). We must thus, ascertain what the

legislature was trying to achieve by amending the Tax Appeals Commission

Act, twice as far as the time bar is concerned.

[34] A legislative intention to amend Section 10 twice by increasing the

time periods for the determining of appeals does not necessarily or

conclusively mean that the failure to make the determination of the Tax

Appeals Commission within the time limit specified in Section 10 is

mandatory. If such drastic consequence was really intended by the

15

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

legislature, it would have made appropriate provisions in express terms in

Section 10 to the effect that the appeal shall be deemed to have been

allowed where the Tax Appeals Commission fails to adhere to the time

limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act.

[35] There are guidelines in tax statutes which stipulate that the failure to

observe any time limit provision would render the appeal null and void or

that the appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed. For example,

Section 165 (14) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 as amended,

provides that an appeal preferred to the Commissioner-General shall be

agreed to or determined by the Commissioner-General within a period of

two years from the date on which such petition of appeal is received....

The same section specifically stipulates that where such appeal is not

agreed to or determined within such period, the appeal shall be deemed

to have been allowed and tax charged accordingly.

[36] The legislature in its wisdom has placed time limit for the speedy

disposal of appeals filed before the Commissioner-General and the overall

legislative intention sought to be attained by the Inland Revenue Act in

Section 165 (14) was to ensure that an appeal before the Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue is disposed of within a period of 2 years from

the date on which the Petition of Appeal is received. As the Commissioner-

General is an interested party against another interested party (tax payer)

in the tax collection, it shall determine the appeal within 2 years from the

receipt of the Petition of Appeal and if not, the appeal shall be deemed to

have been allowed, and tax charged accordingly, so as to safeguard the

rights of the taxpayer

[37] Although the Tax Appeals Commission Act was amended by

Parliament twice and increased the period within which the appeal is to be

determined by the Commission from 200 days to 270 days with

retrospective effect, the legislature in its wisdom did not specify any penal

consequence or any other consequence of non-compliance of the time bar

specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act. Had the

legislature intended that the non-compliance with Section 10 to be

mandatory, it could have easily included a provision with negative words

requiring that an act shall be done in no other manner or at no other time

than that designated in the Section or a provision for a penal consequence

16

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

or other consequence of non-compliance. This proposition was echoed by

FOTH, C. J. in Paul v. The city of Manhattan (1973) 212 Kan 381 as follows:

The language of the enactment itself may provide some guidance. Thus, we said in Shriver v. Board of County Commissioners, 189 Kan. 548, 370 P. 2d 124, Generally speaking, statutory provisions directing the mode of proceeding by public officers and intended to secure order, system and dispatch in proceedings, and by a disregard of which the rights of parties cannot be injuriously affected, are not regarded as mandatory, unless accompanied by negative words importing that the acts required shall not be done in any other manner or time than that designated. (p. 556. Emphasis added). A critical feature of mandatory legislation is often a provision for the consequences of non-compliance. This element was noticed by early legal commentators, for in Bank v. Lyman, supra, we find this observation (p. 413).

[38] Bindras Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Ed. referring to the decision of

Paul v. The city of Manhattan (supra), states that factors which would

indicate that the provisions of a Statute or Ordinance are mandatory are:

(1) the presence of negative words requiring that an act shall be done in

no other manner or at no other time than that designated; or (2) a

provision for a penalty or other consequence of non-compliance (p. 433).

[39] The object sought to be attained by Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act has been designed primarily to expedite the appeal

process filed before the Tax Appeals Commission, which was established

by an Act of Parliament comprising retired Judges of the Supreme Court or

the Court of Appeal and those who have gained wide knowledge and

eminence in the field of Taxation.

[40] It is settled law that the Courts cannot usurp legislative function under

the disguise of interpretation and rewrite, recast, reframe and redesign

the Tax Appeals Commission Act, because this is exclusively in the domain

of the legislature. This proposition was lucidly explained by Lord Simonds

in Magor and St Mellons Rural District Council v. Newport

Corporation [1951] 2 All ER 839, HL. Referring to the speech of Lord

Denning MR, Lord Simonds said at page 841: It appears to me to be a

naked usurpation of the legislative function under the thin disguise of

interpretation, Lord Simonds further stated at 841:

17

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

The duty of the court is to interpret the words that the legislature has used; those words may be ambiguous, but, even if they are, the power and the duty of the court to travel outside them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited. If a gap is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act and not in a usurpation of the legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation.

[41] The same proposition was echoed by Arijit Pasayat, J. in the Indian

Supreme Court case of Padmasundara Rao and Ors. v. State of Tamil Nadu

and Ors. AIR (2002) SC 1334, at paragraph 14, as follows:

14. While interpreting a provision the Court only interprets the law and cannot legislate it. If a provision of law is misused and subjected to the abuse of process of law, it is for the legislature to amend, modify or repeal it, if deemed necessary.

[42] Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 granted

time to the Tax Appeals Commission to hear all appeals within one

hundred and eighty days from the date of the commencement of the

hearing of the appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No.

4 of 2012 extended the said time period from one hundred and eighty days

to two hundred and seventy days from the date of the commencement of

the hearing of the appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act,

No. 20 of 2013 however, reduced the time limit granted to the Tax Appeals

Commission to conclude the appeal by enacting that the time specified in

Section 10 shall commence from the date of the commencement of its

sittings for hearing the appeal.

[43] The legislature has, from time to time, extended and reduced the time

period within which the appeal shall be determined by the Tax Appeals

Commission, but it intentionally and purposely refrained from imposing

any consequence for the failure on the part of the Tax Appeals

Commission to adhere to the time limit specified in Section 10.

[44] The legislature amended the Tax Appeals Commission Act, twice with

retrospective effect and provided time frames to conclude appeals quickly

as possible within the time limit of 270 days from the date of the

commencement of its sittings for the hearing of such appeal. It is true that

the legislature has amended Section 10 with retrospective operation but if

18

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

it intended to take away the jurisdiction of the Tax Appeals Commission

and render its determination made outside the time limit specified in

section 10 invalid, it could have easily made, with retrospective effect,

appropriate provision in express terms that the appeal shall be deemed to

have been allowed or other consequence of non-compliance.

[45] On the other hand, the proviso to Section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 granted time for the Commission to make

its determination in respect of appeal transferred to the Commission from

the Board of Review within a period of hundred and eighty days (180) from

the date of such transfer, notwithstanding anything contained in any other

written law. The Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of 2012

extended the said time period from hundred and eighty days to twelve

months of the date on which the Commission shall commence its sittings.

(Vide-Section 7 of the Act, No. 4 of 2012). The Tax Appeals Commission

(Amendment) Act, No. 20 of 2013 extended the said time period to twenty-

four months from the date on which the Commission shall commence its

sittings for the hearing of each such appeal.

[46] It is crystal clear that these procedural time limit rules in respect of

appeals received by the Tax Appeals Commission or appeals transferred

from the Board of Review to the Commission have been devised by the

legislature to facilitate the appeal process by increasing and reducing the

time period within which such appeals shall be concluded. The provision

for the determination of an appeal by the Tax Appeals Commission within

a period of 270 days from the commencement of its sittings for the hearing

of an appeal has been designed with a view to regulating the duties of the

Tax Appeals Commission by specifying a time limit for its performance as

specified in Section 10 of the Act.

[47] So that the legislature, in its wisdom has made provision in Section 10

to the effect that the appeal shall be disposed of speedily within a period

of 270 days from the date of the commencement of the sittings for the

hearing of the appeal. But the legislature imposed no drastic and painful

penal consequence or other consequence of non-compliance, including

prohibitory or negative words in Section 10, rendering the determination

of the appeal null and void for non-compliance of the time limit specified

in Section 10. In my view, they are not intended to make the parties suffer

19

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

from the failure of the Commission to make the determination within the

time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act.

[48] Any procedural retrospective operation of a provision, in my view,

cannot take away the rights of parties who have no control over those

entrusted with the duty of making determination within the time limit

specified in Section 10. The retrospective operation of Section 10 without

any penal or other consequence of non-compliance, by itself, cannot be

treated as a factor in determining that the legislature intended that the

failure to adhere to the time limit specified in Section 10 is mandatory.

Consequences of non-compliance of a statute by those entrusted

with public duty

[49] One of the important factors that is necessary for determining

whether a provision is mandatory or directory is to find as to who

breached the time limit specified in Section 10-whether it was breached by

one of the parties to the action or by those entrusted with the performance

of a public duty. Also coming under this head are cases where the Court

will take into account the practical inconveniences or impossibilities of

holding a time limit requirement to be mandatory where the public duty is

performed by a public body. If the statutory provision relates to the

performance of a public duty, the Court is obliged to consider whether any

consequence of such breach would work serious public inconvenience, or

injustice to the parties who have no control over those entrusted with such

public duty.

[50] Apart from the absence of reference to penal sanction and other

consequences of non-compliance of Section 10, the impossibility of

adhering to the time limit provision is also a factor in influencing the court

to construe the time limit provision is not mandatory, but as directory only.

As noted, the pending appeals were transferred to the properly

constituted Tax Appeals Commission after the amendment to Section 2

was enacted by the Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No. 4 of

2012 which came into effect on 15.02.2012. A perusal of the record (p. 34)

reveals that the appeal was first fixed for hearing on 17.10.2013 and the

appeal was first held by the Tax Appeals Commission consisting of Justice

20

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

H. Yapa, Mr. J. Somasundaram (Member) and Mr. P.A. Pematilake

(Member).

[51] The next hearing was held on 28.11.2013 only with the participation

of two Members and thus, the hearing was postponed to 28.01.2014 (p.

36). On 28.01.2014, the Commission directed the parties to tender written

submissions on or before 21.02.2014 and fixed the next hearing on

20.03.2014. (p. 51) On 20.03.2014, the hearing was conducted and the

next hearing was fixed for 29.05.2014 (p. 100). On 29.05.2014, the

Commission conducted its sitting with a new Member (Mr. M.N. Junaid)

and decided that since another appeal involving the same parties was

being heard in the Court of Appeal on the identical issue, the next hearing

will be held after receiving the decision of the Court of Appeal (p. 102). The

next hearings were fixed for 17.07.2014 and 02.09.2014, and on

02.09.2014, the Commission directed the parties to file written

submissions on or before 15.09.2014 and reserved the determination (p.

106).

[52] However, the Secretary to the Commission on the direction of the

Commission informed the parties to be present at the Commission on

19.05.2015 to fix a new date for hearing (p. 129) and accordingly, the on

19.05.2015, the Commission fixed a date for hearing on 23.07.2015 (p.

132). On 23.07.2015, the Commission further directed the Appellant to file

written submission on or before 10.08.2015 and the next hearing was fixed

for 08.09.2015 (p. 134). On 08.09.2015, the hearing was not held as Mr.

Junaid was indisposed and thereafter, the hearing was not held due to a

vacancy in the Tax Appeals Commission (p. 160).

[53] After a New Member (Justice S. Rajapaksha) was appointed by the

Minister of Finance, the hearing was held on 02.06.2016 and the

Commission gave time for the settlement of the matter, and the next

hearings were fixed for 30.06.2016 and 14.07.2016 (p. 163 & p. 165). On

14.07.2016, the Commission was not properly constituted (p. 167) and on

04.08.2016, the hearing was postponed on an application made by the

Respondent (p. 169). On 22.11.2016, the Commission reserved the

decision (p. 191) and thereafter, on 14.02.2017 made the determination.

[54] It is true that The Tax Appeals Commission Act has imposed a duty on

the Tax Appeals Commission to make the determination within the time

21

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

limit specified in Section 10 but the parties had no control over those

entrusted with the task of making the determination within the time limit

specified in Section 10. Should the parties who have no control over those

entrusted with the task of making the determination be made to suffer for

any failure or delay on the part of the Tax Appeals Commission in not

making its determination within the time limit specified in Section 10? I do

not think that the legislature intended that the time limit specified in

Section 10 is mandatory where it is impossible for the Commission to make

its determination within such period due to practical reasons or where the

parties had no control over those entrusted with the task of making the

determination within the time limit specified in Section 10. I held the same

view in our decision in S.P. Muttiah v Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (supra).

[55] Maxwell, Interpretation of Statute, 11th Ed. at page 369 referring to the

ascertaining the intention of the legislature in relation to the interpretation

of limitation provision states:

On the other hand, where the prescriptions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and where the invalidation of acts done in neglect of them would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty without promoting the essential aims of the Legislature, such prescriptions seem to be generally understood as mere instructions for the guidance and government of those on whom the duty is imposed, or, in other words, as directory only. The neglect of them may be penal, indeed, but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them. It has often been held, for instance, where an Act ordered a thing to be done by a public body or public officers and pointed out the specific time when it was to be done, then the Act was directory only and might be complied with after the prescribed time [emphasis added.]

[56] Where the statute imposes a public duty on persons and to treat, as

void, acts done without compliance with the statute would cause serious

inconvenience to persons who have no control over those entrusted with

this duty, then the practice is to hold the provision to be directory only so

as not to affect the validity of such action taken in breach of such duty

(Montreal Street Rly. Co. v. Normandin (1917) AC 170, 175). Lord Sir Arthur

Channell echoed this proposition in that case at p. 176 as follows:

22

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work serious general inconvenience, or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty, and at the same time would not promote the main object of the Legislature, it has been the practice to hold such provisions to be directory only, the neglect of them, though punishable, not affecting the validity of the acts done. This principle has been applied to provisions for holding sessions at particular times and places (2 Hale, P. C., p. 50, Rex v. Leicester Justices (1827) 7 B & C. 6 and Parke B. in Gwynne v. Burnell (1835) 2 Bing. N.C. 7);.....

[57] This proposition is further confirmed by Sutherlands Statutory

Construction, Third Ed. Vol. 3. at p. 102 as follows:

A statute specifying a time within which a public officer is to perform an official act regarding the rights and duties of others is directory unless the nature of the act to be performed, or the phraseology of the statute, is such that the designation of time must be considered a limitation of the power of the Officer. At p. 107 it is pointed out that a statutory direction to private individuals should generally be considered as mandatory and that the rule is just the opposite to that which obtains with respect to public officers. Again, at p. 109, it is pointed out that often the question as to whether a mandatory may be directory construction should be given to a statutory provision may be determined by an expression in the statute itself of the result that shall follow the non-compliance with the provision....

[58] If we hold that the literal compliance with the time limit specified in

Section 10 is mandatory, disregarding the fact that neglect was performed

by those who are entrusted with the duty, we will be disregarding the

practical impossibility of the Commission and inconvenience of holding

proceedings and making a determination strictly within the time limit

specified in Section 10. In the present case, the duty to make the

determination within the time limit specified in Section 10 is statutorily

entrusted to the members of the Tax Appeals Commission in terms of the

provisions of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 as amended,

and the parties had no control whatsoever, over the Tax Appeals

Commission.

[59] As Lord Sir Arthur Channell put it correctly, it would cause the greatest

injustice to both parties who had no control over those entrusted with the

23

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

duty of making the determination, if we hold that neglect to observe the

time limit specified in Section 10 of the statute renders the determination

made by the Commission ipso facto null and void. In my view, every

limitation period within which an act must be done, is not necessarily a

prescription of the period of limitation with painful and drastic

consequences and the parties who have no control of those entrusted with

a statutory duty and no fault of them should not be made to suffer and

lose their rights for the failure to adhere to the time limitation specified in

a provision.

[60] In S.P. Muttiah v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra),

this Court held at page 77 and 78;

If we interpret the legislative intent of Section 10 from its mere phraseology, without considering the nature, purpose, the design, the absence of consequences of non-compliance and practical impossibility, which would follow from construing it one way or the other, it will tend to defeat the overall object, design, the purpose and spirit of the Tax Appeals Commission Act

[61] If we hold that the determination of the Commission is null and void,

it will cause serious injustice to parties who have no control over those

entrusted with the duty of discharging functions under the Tax Appeals

Commission Act. In Stafford Motor Company Limited v. The Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (supra), Janak de Silva, J. held that the time

limits granted to the Tax Appeals Commission to make a determination is

not mandatory as the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No. 23 of 2011 (as

amended) does not spell out any sanction for the failure on the part of the

Tax Appeals commission to comply with the time limit set out in Section 10

of the Tax Appeals Commission Act.

[62] In the same case, Janak de Silva, J. having specifically considered the

implication of the Court of Appeal decision in Mohideen v. Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue ((CA 2/2007 (20-15) Vol. XXI. BASL Law Journal,

page 170), held at page 6 that the following statement made by His

Lordship Gooneratne J. referring to the statutory time bar applicable to the

Board of Review in making its determination under the Inland Revenue

Act, No. 38 of 2000 is an obiter:

24

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

If specific time limits are to be laid down, the legislature needs to say

so in very clear and unambiguous terms instead of leaving it to be

interpreted in various ways. To give a restricted interpretation would

be to impose unnecessary sanctions on the Board of Review. It would

be different or invalid if the time period exceeded two years from the

date of oral hearing. If that be so, it is time barred. was an obiter

dicta statement (emphasis added).

[63] The principle laid down by Gooneratne J. in Mohideen v.

Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra) was that the hearing for

the purpose of time limit of 2 years specified in the second proviso to

Section 140 (10) of the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 37 of 2003

commences from the date of the oral hearing and no more. That was the

principle upon which the case was decided by His Lordship Gooneratne J.

which represents the reason and spirit of the decision, and that part alone

is the principle which forms the only authoritative element of a precedent

in Mohideen v. Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra).

[64] In Mohideen v. Commissioner General Inland Revenue (supra), after

having fully endorsed the proposition of law that the hearing

contemplated in the said time bar provision is nothing but oral hearing,

His Lordship as a passing remark stated It would be different or invalid if

the time period exceeded 2 years from the date of the oral hearing. If that

be so, it is time barred (p. 176). That part of the statement enunciated by

His Lordship Gooneratne J. is manifestly an obiter and not the ratio having

a binding authority. Justice Jank de Silva, in Staford Motors v.

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra), Kegalle Plantations PLC

v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (CA/Tax 09/2017 decided

on 04.09.2014) and CIC Agri Business (Private) Limited v. The

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (CA/Tax 42/2014 decided on

29.05.2021), arrived at a similar conclusion.

[65] We took the same view in our judgments in Mr. S.P. Muttiah v. The

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,CA/TAX/46/2019,decided on

26.06.2021 and Amadeus Lanka (Pvt) Ltd v. CGIR (C.A Tax 4/19 decided on

30.07.2021. In Mr. S.P. Muttiah v. The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue, we further held that the directory interpretation of Section 10 is

consistent with the object, purpose and design of the Tax Appeals

25

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Commission Act, which is reflected in the intention of the legislature and

that if a gap is disclosed in the Legislature, the remedy lies is an amending

Act and not in a usurpation of the legislative function under the thin

disguise of interpretation.

[66] I hold that having considered the facts and he circumstances and legal

principles, the failure to adhere to the time limit specified in Section 10 was

not intended by the legislature to be mandatory with painful and drastic

consequences of rendering such determination null and void. For those

reasons, I hold that the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission in

the present case is not time barred and thus, I answer the Question of Law

No. 1 in favour of the Respondent.

Questions of Law Nos. 2, 3 & 7

Deductibility of interest expenses in ascertaining the profits and

income & the Interest attributable to the share trading business

[67] At the hearing, Mr. Goonewardena submitted that the share trading

transaction carried on by the Appellant is not a trade or business but is a

part of the investment business of the Appellant as contemplated by

Section 3 (a) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006. His contention was

that share trading was merely an activity which forms part of the

investment business of the Appellant but it is not a business itself. He

relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in K.A. Don Albert V. Municipal

Revenue Inspector 65 N.L.R. 1 in support of his contention.

[68] On the other hand, the learned State Counsel submitted that the

Appellants core business was manufacturing and selling plastic items, and

in addition to its core business activities, the Appellant is also engaged in

a separate business of trading in shares of public listed companies in Sri

Lanka by investing in shares of John Keels Holding PLC through interest

bearing loans and overdraft facilities. He submitted that the share trading

activity carried on by the Appellant constitutes a business within the

meaning of Section 3 (a) of the Inland Revenue Act..

[69] The first question that arises for determination is whether the interest

expenses incurred by the Appellant on the loans taken for share trading

26

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

activities are deductible against the profits derived from the Appellants

principal business of manufacturing and selling plastic items. In this

context, I desire to ascertain the meaning of the term business and

identify the distinction between business activity and investment

activity within the meaning of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000

(hereinafter referred to as the IRA 2000) or the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10

of 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the IRA 2006).

Whether the share Trading activity of the Appellant is a business within the meaning of the words profits from any business under Section 3 (a) of the Inland Revenue Act

[70] Section 3 of the Inland Revenue Act lists the types of income

chargeable with income tax and Section 3 (a) of the Inland Revenue Act

reads as follows:

3. For the purpose of this Act, profits and income or profits or

income means:

(a) the profits from any trade, business, profession or vocation for

however, short a period on or exercised.

[71] The word "business" has been judicially considered by the highest

authorities and the word "business itself is a word of large and indefinite

import (Smith v. Anderson (1880) 15 Ch. D. 247, 259) and in fiscal statutes,

it must be construed in a broader rather than a restricted sense

(Mazagaon Dock Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax (1958) 34 ITR 368). In

the Privy Council case of Income Tax Commissioner v. Shaw Wallace & Co

(59 Indian Appeals, 206 at 213), Sir George Lowndes observed at page 212:

"Income, their Lordships think, in this Act connotes a periodical monetary return coming in with some sort of regularity or expected regularity, from definite sources. The source is not necessarily one which is expected to be continuously productive, but it must be one whose object is the production of a definite return, excluding anything in the nature of a mere windfall. Thus, income has been likened pictorially to the fruit of a tree, or the crop of a field. It is essentially the produce of something which in often loosely spoken of as capital. But capital, though possibly the source in the case of income from

27

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

securities, is in most cases hardly more than an element in the process of production."

[72] After setting out the sources from which the taxable income under the

Act was to be derived as enumerated in section 6, one of which was

"business" as defined in section 2(4), it was observed by the Privy Council

at page 213:

"The words used are no doubt wide, but underlying each of them is the fundamental idea of the continuous exercise of an activity."

[73] In Narain Swadeshi Weaving Mills v. Commissioner of Excess Profits

Tax, AIR 1955 SC 176, their Lordships of the Supreme Court of India, while

referring with approval to the dictum in Income Tax Commissioner v. Shaw

Wallace & Co., (supra) held that the words used in that definition are no

doubt wide, but underlying each of them is the fundamental idea of the

continuous exercise of an activity", observed at page 773:

The word business connotes some real, substantial and systematic or organised course of activity or conduct with a set purpose. On the other hand, a single and isolated transaction has been held to be conceivably capable of falling within the definition of business as being an adventure in the nature of trade provided the transaction bears clear indicia of trade. The question, therefore, whether a particular source of income is business is."

[74] In Narain Swadeshi Weaving Mills v. Commissioner of Excess profits

Tax (supra), their Lordships of the Supreme Court stated that (a) the mere

fact that a person received amounts by gambling, or betting or in a game

of chance, does not be itself establish that the transaction is in nature of a

business, and income is not casual and non-recurring; (b) It must further

be established that it must involve continuous exercise of activity or an

organised or systematic effort or enterprise on part of the assessee.

[75] In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Korean Syndicate, Ltd., (1921)

3 KB 258; the Court of Appeal of England held that the company was

carrying on the business for which object it had been incorporated,

namely, (a) the business of acquisition of concessions and (b) the turning

of the same to account, although it might be doing so in a passive rather

than an active way.

[76] In Inland Revenue Commissioners v Westleigh Estates Company

Limited, Inland Revenue Commissioners v. South Behar Railway

Company, Limited, Inland Revenue Commissioners v. Eccentric Club,

Limited. [1924] 1 K.B. 390, Pollock M.R. stated at pp. 413-412 as follows:

Its business may be quiescent, and, to a large extent, a matter of routine. Its receipts may be derived, if not wholly, at least almost entirely from the annual payments made to it by the Secretary of State; but it remains a company alive, and still requiring, if only in smaller details, the direction of its directors and the duties carried out by its secretary. It is still concerned in the business of disposing of and dividing the profits, which it has become entitled to by reason of its greater activity in the past, and that activity, as well as possibly others, may be awakened and quickened in the future. For these reasons I am of opinion that the appeal must be allowed, with costs here and below.

[77] This decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in Inland Revenue

Commissioners v. Westleigh Estates Company, Limited, Inland Revenue

Commissioners Same v. South Behar Railway Company, Limited, Inland

Revenue Commissioners v. Eccentric Club, Limited. decided on 19.02.1925

and Lord Summer at page 711 stated:

It is obvious that the Companys objects have by no means been accomplished. It is obvious, too, that during its present period of dormant life, it has very little to do. I do not attach much importance to the domestic operations of declaring and paying dividends, remunerating directors and presenting reports, but the operation of receiving and thus discharging the annuity payments goes on continuously and however, simple it is not a mere passive acquiescence. It is the transaction of business between debtor and creditor resulting periodically in the discharge of a debt. The present is not the case of a company existing to do one act only and once for all. Not only did the company existing to do one act only and once for all. Not only did the company make the agreement of 1906, but it plays its recurring part in every payment and receipt of gains, and there is here, therefore, that repetition of acts, which Lord Justice Brett says (15 Ch. D. at p. 277) is implied in carrying on business.

[78] The word business has been defined in Section 217 of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 and the definition is inclusive and not

exhaustive in nature. It is as follows:

29

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Business includes an agricultural undertaking, the racing of horses,

the letting or leasing of any premises, including any land by a

company and the forestry

[79] Thus, the word business connotes some real, substantial and

systematic or organized course of activity or conduct with a set purpose,

and It is a word of extensive use and indefinite signification. Therefore, the

Inland Revenue Act could not have used a larger word to define the term

business in Section 217 of the Act. Then, "business is a particular

occupation, as agriculture, trade, mechanics, art, or profession, and when

used in connection with particular employments, it admits of the

plural that is, businesses (Smith v. Anderson (supra), p. 259).

[80] The House of Lords rejected the argument in Liverpool and London

and Globe Insurance Co. v. Bennett 6 T.C. 327 that investments of reserve

funds were not part of the business of the company, and held that the

interest and dividends derived from the said investments irrespective of

their object formed part of the companys trading profit. In Graham v.

Green (1925) 2 K.B. 37 at 42, ROWLATT J. referred to the distinction

between any individual acts and the conception of business/trade acts as

an organism, and held at p. 41 that the conception of a trade or business

or vocation which is an organised effort to obtain emoluments differs in

its nature from the individual acts as follows:

But then there is no doubt that if you set on foot an organized seeking after emoluments which are not in themselves profits, you may create, by way of a trade, or an adventure, or a vocation, a subject matter which does bear fruit in the shape of profits or gains. A different conception arises, a conception of a trade or vocation which differs in its nature, in my judgment, from the individual acts which go to build it up, just as a bundle differs from odd sticks. You may say, I think, without an abuse of language, that there is something organic about the whole which does not exist in its separate parts.

[81] He then proceeded to apply the test to determine the individual acts

and trade/business acts in case of making profits or losses, and held at

page 41 that when a person makes an organised effort to obtain

emoluments, earns profits or incurs losses, such profits or losses are due

30

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

to the organised trade/business activities, and not the individual activities

as follows:

As I have said, there is no doubt that one might create a trade by making an organized effort to obtain emoluments which are not in themselves taxable as profits, and the most familiar instance of all, of course, is a trade which has for its object the securing of capital increment. A person who buys an object which subsequently turns out to be worth more than he gave for it, and which he sells, does not thereby make a profit or gain for income tax purposes. But he can organize himself to do that in a commercial and mercantile way, and the profits, which emerge are taxable profits, not of the transaction, both of the trade. In the same way, he may carry on the trade of selling things which he has not got and buying them when the price has fallen. That is a capital accretion, only the operations are reversed. He sells first and buys afterwards. And in that way, he may make losses or he may make profits. If he makes losses, the losses cannot be said to be the results of the individual acts; they are the results of the trade as a whole. Test it in this way. A person may organize an effort to find things. He may start a salvage or exploring undertaking and he may make profits. The profits are not the profits of the findings, they are the profits of the adventure as a whole. Again, he may make a loss. One cannot say that the loss was due to the failure to find. The loss is due to the trade. That is a good test, because it shows the difference between the trade as an organism and the individual acts.

[82] The Appellant heavily relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in

K.A. Don Albert v. Municipal Revenue Inspector 65 N.L.R. 1 in support of its

stand. K.A. Don Albert v. Municipal Revenue Inspector (supra) did not

involve the imposition of taxation, and it was only concerned about the

interpretation of the words trade or business in terms of the by-law made

under section 147 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance (Cap. 252). The by-

law made under section 147 of the Ordinance prohibited certain trades or

businesses to be offensive trades or businesses including manufacture or

storing of furniture or manufacture and storing of furniture.

[83] The Supreme Court held that (i) the words trade or business in

section 147 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance are coupled together and

the meaning of the word business is coloured by the word trade: (ii) the

context should be regarded as excluding all other meanings of the words

31

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

except those that are compatible with its associate trade; (iii) the question

whether a business consisting of many ancillary activities is one business

within the meaning of section 147 or a number of separate businesses

under one direction has to be determined by an examination of the

various activities.

[84] Having applied the above test, the Supreme Court held that the

activities of stocking, polishing, touching-up, assembling, repairing were all

parts of one business of dealing with furniture, and the prohibition in the

by-law did not apply to storing of furniture per se but, it applies only to the

storing of furniture of others for gain. The facts and the issues in the

present case are totally different from the case relied on by the Appellant

and thus, the decision of the Supreme Court in K.A. Don Albert v. Municipal

Revenue Inspector (supra) will not support the argument of the Appellant.

[85] The facts of this case reveal that the Appellant has obtained loans for

the investment in shares of John Keels Holding PLC and other companies

and carried on business regularly and systematically in an organized effort

and in a commercial and mercantile manner, to obtain profits and income.

In B.P. Medonza v. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue [(1979) 1 N.L.R.

459], the question was whether or not betting activities amounted to a

business. It was held that if betting on horse racing can be shown to be so

organized and carried on systematically, they amount to a business.

Samarawickrema J. observed at pp. 477-478:

Where the evidentiary material discloses the facts which I have set out, it is not possible for this Court to hold that there is no evidence to support a finding that the assessees betting activities amount to a business. In point of fact the evidence amply supports such a finding. The order of the Board states: The systematic and continuous way the assessee had taken bets, the time and labour he had put into them, the facilities he had built around himself to place these bets and deposit the winnings clearly indicate that betting was a vocation and his dominant intention was to gain money. [86] As stated, the Appellant has carried on its share trading activities

regularly, systematically and in an organized manner to obtain profits, and

thus, any losses made in the course of such operations cannot be said to

be the result of the individual act of the Appellant, but they are the results

32

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

of the organized business activities of the Appellant. The nature of the

share trading carried on by the Appellant in the present case is not a mere

case of holding of investments in shares for the purpose of earning

dividends so as to exclude it from the expression of carrying on a

business. In the result, there is no merit in the contention of the Appellant

that the share trading carried on by the Appellant is merely an individual

activity, and not a business activity conducted by the Appellant.

[87] Janak de Silva J. in CEI Plastics Limited v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue CA/Tax/03/2013 decided on 01.02.2019 took the same

view at page 6 of the judgment as follows:

In the instant case, the Appellant had obtained separate bank facilities for the specific purpose of share trading and the shares so purchased were mortgaged as security. There had been repetitive share trading transactions which had been carried on systematically in an organized manner. There facts in my view establish that the share trading activity referred to by the Appellant constituted a business within the meaning of Section 3 (a) of the Act.

[88] Applying the principles laid down in the above-mentioned cases,

which I have cited, I desire to say that the interest incurred by the Appellant

in relation to its share trading activity falls within the words the profits

from any business under Section 3 (a) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38

of 2000 or the Inland Revenue Act, No 10 of 2006.

Is share trading a separate and distinct business activity from the principal business activities of the Appellant?

Investment activity and business activity-

[89] The next question to decide is whether the share trading activity carried on by the Appellant is a separate business activity from the business of manufacturing and selling of plastic items or it is a part and parcel of the main business activities of the Appellant.

[90] At the hearing, the learned State Counsel submitted that the Appellant who conducts two separate business activities is obliged to maintain separate accounts so that the profits and income from each distinct business could be identified separately as required by Section 98 (5) of the

33

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 or Section 106 (11) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[91] The Appellant concedes that it is involved in the business of manufacturing and selling of plastic items, and in addition to the said business, it is involved in the share trading by investing in the shares of John Keels Holdings PLC, where the Appellant together with other related persons, is the largest single shareholder (Written submissions of the Appellant dated 03.07.2018, p.1). The Appellant, however, asserts that although the Appellant is involved in two lines of business, these businesses do not enjoy different tax rates and thus, Section 106(11) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 does not apply to the Appellant. On that basis, the Appellant argues that there is no requirement for the Appellant to maintain and prepare separate statement of accounts for each line of business.

[92] According to the audited statement of accounts of the Appellant, as

contained in the letters of the Assessor (pp. 31-43 & 31-41), the Appellant

has obtained loans and overdraft facilities from Banks for the periods in

question as follows:

Y/A

2006/2006 (Rs.)

Y/A

2006/2007 (Rs.)

Bank loans and

overdrafts obtained

540,880,423 1,719,658,881

Investment in shares

of other companies

375,713,437 1,183,172,223

Interest expenses 52,479,392 150,015,560

[93] The Appellant has purchased and sold shares during the years of

assessment in question and the number of transactions that occurred in

respect of buying and selling shares, as shown in Tax Appeals Commission

brief (p. 31-14) are as follows:

Year of Assessment 2005/06 2006/07

Purchase of shares 375,723,437 1,183,172,323

sale proceeds value 56,767,752 51,326,417

profit 54,823,737 4,347,519

34

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

[94] The turnover from manufacturing plastic items and short-term loan obtained by the Appellant for the years of assessment as stated at page 31-8 of the TAC brief is as follows:

Turnover from

2005/06 2006/07 Manufacturing plastic items

606,743,846 731,326,559

Short term loan obtained

27,000,000 129,909,296

[95] The above figures demonstrate that the turnover of manufacturing of

plastic items for the year 2006/07 (Rs 731,326,559) is less than the value of

the purchase of shares in the year 2006/07, which confirms that the

Appellant has obtained bank loans and overdrafts (Rs. 1,719,658,881) and

invested in the share market (Rs.1,183,172,323). The figures further

confirm that the Appellant is involved in the share trading business and

regularly, systematically and in an organized manner purchased and sold

shares invested in John Keels Holding PLC. The transactions stated above

clearly demonstrate that the Appellant is involved in two separate

business activities, the manufacture and selling of plastic items, and share

trading business.

[96] The contention of the Appellant that the investment in shares should

be treated as an activity for the purpose of receiving dividends is clearly

negated by the fact that the Appellant is involved in an organized share

trading business of buying and selling shares for profits. In the case of

holding investment shares for the purpose of earning dividends, the

investor knows, at the time of investing in those shares that it may

generate dividend income as and when such dividend income is generated

that would be earned by the investor. The transaction of trading business

carried on by the Appellant is not confined to mere "dealing in or holding

of investments" or wholly or mainly for the purpose of earning or receiving

dividends.

[97] There are two separate business activities carried on by the Appellant.

One is the manufacture and selling of plastic items, and the other is the

share trading. Each of the business does not comprise two or more

35

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

business activities of an allied nature, and they are completely two

separate business activities. In the present case, shares are held as "stock-

in-trade", and the Appellant is involved in the business of buying and

selling of shares for the purpose of earning profits or income. It becomes

a business activity of the Appellant to deal in those shares as a business

proposition.

[98] Therefore, it is not possible to accept the contention of the Appellant

that both business activities are embedded in each other or both business

activities can be combined as part and parcel of one business of the

company for the purpose of calculating the profits of the Appellant for the

years of assessment in question.

[99] The Appellant further contends that Section 106 (11) is an administrative provision which simply sets out an obligation to prepare separate accounts so that separate lines of business which are taxed differently can be separately identified. The Appellant further contents that Section 106 (11) does not specify or provide the basis of deductibility of expenses for each line of business and thus, there is no basis for a separate computation of profit for each line of business unless there is a specific provision to that effect in the Inland Revenue Act.

[100] Section 98 (5) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 and Section 106 (11) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 relate to the obligation of any taxpayer to maintain and prepare separate statements of accounts in a manner that the profits and income from each such business activity can be separately identified. Section 98 (5) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 reads as follows:

Where any person carries on or exercises more than one business, trade, profession or vocation and the profits and income from such business, trade, profession or vocation are chargeable with tax at different rates, such person shall maintain and prepare statements of accounts in a manner that the profits and income from each such activity may be separately identified.

[101] Section 106 (11) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 read as follows:

Where any person carries on or exercises more than one trade, business, profession vocation and the profits and income from such trade, business, profession or vocation are exempted from or

36

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

chargeable with tax at different rates, such person shall maintain and prepare statements of accounts in a manner that the profits and income from each such activity, may be separately identified.

[102] This section [(S. 106(11)] was included in the Inland Revenue Act, No.

10 of 2006 after the judgment of the Supreme Court in Rodrigo v. The

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (2002) 1 Sri L.R. 384). In ICICI

Bank v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (CA Tax No. 28/2013

decided on 16.07.2015), in addition to its primary banking business, the

Appellant Bank also invested money in Sri Lanka Development Bonds. The

Appellant in that case argued that all its business activities including the

investment fall within one banking business. The Court of Appeal found

that the Appellant carried on more than one business, including one trade,

business, profession or vocation and thus, the Appellant was engaged,

within the scope of banking businesses, in multiple businesses at the same

time earning income from separate sources.

[103] The Court of Appeal took the view that (i) as section 106 (11) of the

Inland Revenue Act recognises that one entity can have several businesses;

(ii) where a person carries on or exercises more than one trade, business,

profession or vocation, the profits and income from such trade, business

etc. are exempted from tax at different rates; (iii) such person must

however, maintain and keep separate statement of accounts in a manner

that the profits and income from each activity to be separately identified;

and (iv) unless the Appellant keeps a separate account, he will not be able

to obtain the tax benefit as the tax benefit is granted only to the accrued

interest in the investment of Sri Lanka Development Bonds.

[104] The Appellant also relies on 13 (t) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10

of 2006 which exempts profits and income-

(ii) for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2017,

derived by or accruing to any person or partnership, from the sale of

any share, a right to any share, a bonus share or a share warrant in

respect of which the share transaction levy under section 7 of the

Finance Act, No. 5 of 2005, has been charged.

37

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

[105] The Appellants argument is that where the profits from the sale of

shares in unlisted companies or where the Share Transaction Levey has

not been paid, would not attract an exemption and would be taxed at the

normal rates which are applicable to companies. On this basis, the

Appellant argues that there is no basis for the assertion of the Tax Appeals

Commission that the share trading is a separate business of the Appellant

which attracts a different rate of tax from the core business. Section 13 (t)

exempts only profits from the trading of shares of public listed companies

in respect of which a share transaction levy has been charged in terms of

section 7 of the Finance Act, No. 5 of 2005.

[106] Section 7 relates to the imposition of Share Transaction Levy and

provides that There shall be imposed with effect from the year

commencing on January 1, 2005 and for every year thereafter, a levy to be

called the Share Transaction Levy at the rate of 0.2 per centum shall be

imposed of Share Transaction Levy from every buyer and seller, on the

turnover of every share trading transaction, which is conducted through a

Stock Exchange.

[107] The Appellant has admitted in paragraph 1 of the written

submissions dated 03.07.2018 that:

It also has a substantial portfolio of shares in public listed companies

in Sri Lanka. The principal investment of the Appellant is in the shares

of John Keels Holdings PLC, where the Appellant, together with other

related persons, is the single largest shareholder.

[108] Accordingly, the argument of the Appellant that the profits from the

sale of shares in unlisted companies would not attract an exemption and

would be taxed at the normal rates which are applicable to companies has

no basis. The Appellants own admission indicates that the share trading

activities fall within the ambit of the exemption provided for in Section 13

(t) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006.

[109] In dealing with the Question of Law No. 7, the Appellant argues that

the Tax Appeals Commission has impliedly accepted that interest

expenses relating to a strategic investment may be deductible, whereas

the interest expenses relating to share trading would not, but the Tax

38

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Appeals Commission has failed to identify, based on the figures mentioned

as to what part of the shares fell into each category, and what portion of

interest expense would be deductible.

[110] In ICICI Bank v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra),

Dehideniya, J. stated at p. 9:

As I have mentioned earlier, the Appellant has disregarded the law. Section 106(11) of the IRA imposes a duty cast upon the Respondent to maintain separate accounts, when it became necessary. Even though the Appellant has not produced any document or a separate account in this case, the Appellant stated at the inquiry that they are keeping all the data in their computers. Still, they failed to submit them at the inquiry. Without conducting the business as required by law, the Appellant cannot be heard to say that the system adopted by the Commissioner is arbitrary, and the opinion of this court is that it is not bad in law. (emphasis added)

[111] The Appellant cannot be heard to say that the Tax Appeals

Commission has failed to identify the correct portion of the interest

expense when the Appellant failed to maintain separate accounts as

required by law and submit them at the inquiry before the Assessor, the

Respondent and the Tax Appeals Commission. It is abundantly clear that

the Appellant has failed to maintain and prepare separate accounts as

required by Section 98 (5) of the IRA 2000 and Section 106 (11) of the IRA

2006.

[112] There is a statutory obligation upon the Appellant to maintain and

prepare separate accounts in a manner that the profits and income from

each such activity, can be separately identified. The Appellant has,

however, calculated the profit of the share trading business by deducting

the interest expenses from the income of the share trading business and

charged the interest expenses of the share trading business to the profit

and loss statement of the core business of manufacturing and selling of

plastic items.

[113] It is not in dispute that the Appellant is entitled to claim an exemption

stipulated in Section 13 (t) of the Inland Revenue Act in respect of its share

trading, but the Appellant is under obligation to maintain and prepare

39

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

separate accounts in respect of its two separate businesses as required by

Section 106 (11) and claim such benefit under Section 13 (t). For that

purpose, the Appellamt must show that it carries on one business entity,

which has two branches or each of the business activity comprises two or

more business activities of an allied nature to constitute the whole

business. The Appellant has failed to show that carried on business entity,

which has two branches or each of the business activity comprises two or

more business activities of an allied nature to constitute the whole

business.

Deductibility of interest expenses as outgoings and expenses in

ascertaining the profits and income of the Appellant

[114] The next question is to decide whether or not the interest expenses

incurred by the Appellant are deductible under Section 23(1)(h) of the IRA

2000 or under Section 26(1)(f) of the IRA 2006 as outgoings and expenses

incurred in the production of the profits or income of the Appellant.

[115] The Appellant, however, argues that the Appellant is entitled to

deduct the interest expenses of its share trading business to the value of

Rs. 52,479,392 (for the year 2005/06) and Rs. 150,015,460 (for the year

2006/07) in determining the profits from business of the Appellant for the

said years of assessment in terms of Section 23 (1) (h) of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 or Section 25 (1) (f) of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 of 2006. Mr. Goonewardena relied on the decisions of this Court in

Geometry Global (Private) Limited v. Commissioner-General of Inland

Revenue CA/Tax/01/2017, decided on 12.11. 2021 and Ogilvy Action (Pvt)

Ltd v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue CA/Tax/0016/2013,

decided on 12.11.2021, in support of his contention that the specific

deduction rules in the Inland Revenue Act are not restricted by any general

restriction placed by the statute on deductions.

[116] On the other hand, the learned State Counsel submitted that the

umbrella clause and the prohibition in Section 26 (1) (g) apply to the word

outgoings as well, however, the question whether outgoings have been

incurred in the production of income will not arise in the present case as

the expenses claimed by the Appellant in Section 23(1)(h) of the IRA 2000

40

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

or Section 25 (1) (f) of the IRA 2006 relate to interest expenses that cannot

be deducted as an outgoing under Section 24 (g) of the IRA 2000 or Section

26 (1) (g) of the IRA 2006.

[117] The learned State Counsel strongly relied on the decisions in CEI

Plastic Limited v. Commissioner General Inland Revenue C.A/Tax/03/2013

decided on 01.02.2019, Rodrigo v. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (2002) 1 Sri L.R. 384, ICICI Bank Limited v. Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue C.A. Tax/28/2013, decided on 16.07.2015, The Ceylon

Tea Propaganda Board v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 67 N.L.R. 1 and

the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue v. A.L.J. Cross Raj Chandra

67 N.L.R. 174 in support of his contention

The Scheme relating to the deduction of expenditure in ascertaining

profits and income under the Inland Revenue Act

[118] Under Section 2 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act, income tax shall,

subject to the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, be charged at the

appropriate rates specified in the First, Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth

Schedules to the Act, for every year of assessment commencing on or after

April, 1, 2006 in respect of the profits and income of every person for that

year of assessment-

(a) wherever arising, in the case of a person who is resident in Sri Lanka

in that year of assessment; and

(b) arising in or derived from Sri Lanka, in the case of every other

person.

[119] Under Section 3 of the Act, income tax payable upon the profits and

income or profit or income of a person in respect of number of categories

of profits and income or profits or income listed in Section 3 (1) (a) to

(j), including from a trade or business or employment or any other source

whatsoever, not including profits of a casual and non-recurring nature.

Deductions allowed in ascertaining profits and income-General Deduction Rule- Section 23 (1) of the IRA 2000 and Section 25(1) of the IRA 2006

41

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

[120] Income chargeable with tax is, however, arrived at after taking into

account the various exemptions and deductions allowed under the Act and

thus, the profits and income or profit or income on which income tax is

payable may be either exempted or deducted by the provisions of the Act.

Income tax is calculated by deducting general and specific expenses

from the taxpayers total assessable income for the assessment year. In

Hayley and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra),

Basnayake C.J., dealing with Section 9 (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance of

Ceylon (Cap. 188), which is the corresponding provision of Section 23 (1) of

IRA 2000 or Section 25 (1) of the IRA 2006, classified the types of deductions

for the purpose of Section 9 (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance of Ceylon

(Cap. 188).

[121] Basnayake C.J., stated that Section 9 (1) deals with three classes of

deductions, (i) outgoings; (ii) expenses incurred by the assessee in the

production of the profits or income and (iii) the specific deductions

allowed by paragraphs (a) -(i) thereof. The general deductions referred to

by Basnayake C.J., in Section 9 (1) are outgoings and expenses incurred by

the assessee in the production of profits and income while the deductions

referred to in paragraphs (a) -(i) thereof are the specific deductions. A

general deduction provision generally allows the taxpayer to deduct from

his assessable income any outgoings or expenses incurred in the

production of profits and income of any person.

[122] The body of Section 23 (1) of the IRA 2000 or I Section 25 (1) of the

IRA 2006 contains what is known as a general rule of deduction that allows

the deduction of all outgoings and expenses incurred in the production

of profits or income of any person. Section 23 (1) of the IRA 2000 reads as

follows:

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (4), there shall be

deducted for the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of any

person from any source, all outgoings and expenses incurred by

such person in the production thereof, including ...

(h) interest paid or payable by such person;

42

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

[123] Section 25 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 reads as

follows:

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (4) there shall be deducted for the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of any person from any source, all outgoings and expenses incurred by such person in the production thereof, including-....

[124] Section 23 (1) or Section 25 (1) is called a general deduction rule

because it deducts all types of outgoings and expenses and thus, it

prescribes a positive test of deductibility. It provides for what is deductible

for the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of any person from

any source. These deductions are allowed only if they fulfil the cumulative

criteria of being within the permissive provisions of Section 23 (1) or 25 (1)

and outside the general prohibitive provisions of Section 24 (1) or 26 (1) or

26 (2).

[125] Firstly, it is important to understand the outgoings and expenses

referred to in Section 23(1)/25 (1). In order to be qualified for deduction

under Section 23(1)/25 (1), first, it must have been all outgoings and

expenses incurred in the production of the profits or income. However,

there is a distinction between outgoings and expenses for the purposes

of Section 23(1)/25 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act.

[126] In the New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles

(Clarendon Press, 1993, Volume 2) at p 2038, outgoing is defined to be

expenditure, outlay. The Blacks Law Dictionary (West, 9th Ed, 2009) at

658 defines the term expense as an expenditure of money, time, labour,

or resources to accomplish a result; especially, a business expenditure

chargeable against revenue for a specific period. Expenditure in turn is

defined by Blacks Law Dictionary as 1. The act or process of paying out;

disbursement. 2. A sum paid out.

[127] The meaning of outgoings was examined by two Sri Lankan cases in

Healy and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (65 N.L.R. 174)

and Rodrigo v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue ((2002) 1 Sri LR 384). In

this regard, it must be noted that the decision of the Supreme Court in

43

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Healy and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) was

followed by Bandaranayake J, (as she then was) in Rodrigo v.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra). The decision in Healy and

Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) dealt with the

general deduction rule in Section 9 (1), specific deduction rule in sub-

sections (1) -(i) of Section 9 (1) thereof, and the prohibition of deduction in

Section 10 (c) of the Income Tax Ordinance (Chap 188), is instructive.

[128] In Healy and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue

(supra), Basnayake C.J., drew a distinction between the word outgoings

and expenses in Section 9 (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance of Ceylon and

considered their relationship and limitations. This case considered the

question whether the loss suffered by the burglary was an outgoing

under Section 9 (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance of Ceylon for the purpose

of ascertaining the profits or income of the Company from its trade or

business. Basnayake, C.J. explained the distinction between the word

outgoing and expenses at p. 175 as follows:

The word outgoings mean what goes out and is a word of wide import. It is the opposite of the equally wide expression expense, which means what comes in. In the context the word expense is limited by the words incurred by such person in the production thereof, while the word outgoings is not so limited. The two words are designed to express two different concepts one of wider import than the other. All outgoings are not expenses incurred in the production of the profits or income; but all expenses incurred in the production of the profits or income are outgoings. Apart from expenses incurred in the production of profits or income the section specifically mentions other outgoings. The word outgoings in this context, must be construed as outgoings other than those specifically mentioned. ....

[129] Apart from the outgoings as deductions, a taxpayer can also rely on

the expenses incurred in the production of income to be claimed as

deductions, which are all outgoings but all outgoings are not expenses

incurred in the production of the profits or income. Based on the reasoning

of Basnayake, C.J. in Healy and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue (supra), stated that the term outgoing is wider than the term

expense and while the word expense is limited by the words

44

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

incurred in the production of the profits or income, the word

outgoing is not limited by those words.

[130] On the analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case, Basnayake,

C.J., held that while the loss suffered by burglary was not an expense

incurred in producing the profits of the business, the loss was an outgoing

deductible under Section 9 (1) in ascertaining the profits or income.

Sinnetamby, J. In the same case, while agreeing that the word outgoing is

wider than the term expense, stated that it must not be limited to

voluntary payments, but would also include involuntary outgoings such as

petty theft by subordinates (p. 177). Sinnetamby, J. stated however, that

the outgoings must be of such a nature as would come within the

meaning of the expression incurred in the production of profits (supra).

Sinnetamby, J. held that the loss suffered by the assessee must be

regarded as incidental to the assessees business and thus, it was

deductible under Section 9 (1) of the Ordinance.

[131] The only disagreement of the views expressed by Basnayake, C.J. and

Sinnetamby, J. related to the question whether or not the outgoings must

be limited by the words incurred in the production of profits or income.

The proposition of Basnayake, C.J. was confirmed by the Supreme Court

decision in Rodrigo v. Commissioner of Income Tax (supra) where

Bandaranayake, J. (as she then was) with Sarath N. Silva, C.J. and Ismail, J.

agreeing interpreted the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of

2000 and observed at page 390:

It is obvious that Section 23 focuses on all aspects of expenses as it refers not only to expenses, but also to the outgoings. The word outgoings gives a wider meaning than the word expense. Outgoings incurred by a person carrying out a profession, could include a wide variety of items, which would not come within the meaning of expenses. Basnayake, C.J. in Healy and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra), considered the two phrases referred to above which formed section 9 (1) of the former Income Tax Ordinance. Section 9 (1) is similar to section 23 (1) of our current Act.

45

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

[132] Having reproduced the observations made by Basnayake, C.J. at page

175 of the judgment, Bandaranayake, J. in Rodrigo v. Commissioner of

Inland Revenue (supra) stated at page 390:

On the other hand, in addition to the outgoings a taxpayer would also

rely on the expenses that incurred in the production of the income to

be claimed as deductions.

[133] The cumulative effect of the views expressed by Basnayake, C.J. and

Bandaranayake, J. is that while the word expenses is limited by the words

incurred in the production of profits or income, outgoings incurred by a

person carrying out a profession could include a wide variety of items,

which would not come within the meaning of expenses.

Deductions not allowed in ascertaining profits and income-General Prohibition of Deduction Rule-S.24 of the IRA 2000 or S.26 of the IRA 2006

[134] Next, I will turn to deductions prohibited in ascertaining profits and

income of any person in terms of the provisions of the two Inland Revenue

Acts. While Section 23(1)/25 (1) refers to general deductions allowed in

ascertaining profits or income, Section 24 (1) of the IRA 2000 or Section 26

(1)/ (2) of the IRA 2006 deals with deductions not allowed in ascertaining

profits and income (general prohibition of deduction). Section 24 (1)/24

(1)(g) of the IRA 2000 reads as follows:

24 (1) For the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of any person from any source, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of

(g) any disbursements or expenses of such person, not being money

expended for the purpose of producing such profits or income.

[135] The identical Section 25 (1)/25 (1)(g) of the IRA 2006 reads as follows:

26 (1) For the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of any person from any source, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of

46

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

(g) any disbursements or expenses of such person, not being money

expended for the purpose of producing such profits or income.

[136] In essence, Section 24(1) or 26 (1) of the Act prescribes a negative test

of deductibility and prohibits deductions in respect of all outgoings or

expenses specified in Section 23(1)/25(1) of the Act. This means that even if

they fall within Section 23(1)/25 (1), we will still need to consider whether

they would be excluded under Section 24/26 for the purpose of the general

deductibility or general limitations on deductibility.

[137] In order to decide the question of whether general deductions

permitted under Section 23(1)/25 (1) are prohibited under Section 24/26,

Sections 23(1)/25 (1) and 24/26 have to be read together as both Sections

apply to the general deductibility of outgoings or expenses. in Rodrigo v.

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) in interpreting the

provisions of Sections 23 (1) and 24 (1) (g) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38

of 1979, which are identical to Section 25 (1) and 26 (1) (g) of the Inland

Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006, Bandaranajake, J. (as she then was) stated that:

Sections 23 (1) and 24 of the Act have to be read together as both provisions apply to the deductibility from the income. While section 23 spells out the permissible expenses, section 24 expressly disallows the whole of part of certain expenses, which if not so prohibited, would be allowable. The combined effect of sections 23 and 24 therefore is to divide all outgoings and expenses into two categories: outgoing expenses which are deductible and not deductible. [138] It was not disputed by the parties at the hearing that Section 23(1)/25

(1) and Sections 24/26 must be read together in considering whether or not

any outgoing or expense referred to in Section 23(1)/25 (1) is capable of

being deducted as the dispute relates to the deductibility of expenses

referred to Section 23(1)(h) of the IRA 2000 or Section 26(1)(f) of the IRA

2006, and limitations of deductions under Section 24(1) (g) of the IRA 2000

or Section 26(1)(g) of the IRA 2006.

[139] In order to be qualified for a general deduction under Section 23(1)/25

(1), outgoings or expenses must have fulfilled the requirements of Section

23(1)/25 (1), (which depends on the circumstances of each case), read with

47

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

the prohibitions set out in Sections 24/ 26 of the Act. In other words, when

they qualify both under Sections 23(1)/25 (1) and 24/26, they are allowable

deductions in ascertaining the profits and income of any person.

[140] The prohibition of deductions (negative limb) in Section 24 (1) (g) of

the IRA 2000 or 26 (1) (g) of IRA 2006 may relate to an outgoings or expenses

such as (i) domestic or private expenses; (ii) expense of a capital nature or

loss of capital; (iii) employment expenses, expenses in travelling outside Sri

Lanka; (iv) entertainment expenses; (v) cost of any improvement effected,

rent or expenses; (vi) any disbursement or expenses of such persons, not

being money expended for producing profits or income, etc.

[141] The effect of Section 23(1)/25 (1) read with Section 24(1)/26 (1) is that

it permits deductions of all outgoings and expenses which satisfy the

following characteristics under section 23(1)/25 (1):

(i) deductions must have been either outgoings or expenses; and

(ii) (a) they must be outgoings incurred in the carrying out a trade,

business, profession or vocation, which could include, a wide

variety of items, which would not come within the meaning of

expenses; or

(b) they must be expenses incurred in the production of the profits

or income; and

(iii) they must be not deductions prohibited under Section 24/26 in

ascertaining profits and income (excluded deductions from the

general deduction in Section 23(1)/25 (1).

Specific Deduction Formula-Section 23 (1) (a) -(t) or 25 (1) (a) -(w)

[142] In addition to the general deductions (outgoings and expenses)

specified in Section 23 (1)/25 (1), it has several other sub-sections, referring

to several outgoings or expenses that are permitted to be deducted, which

the Appellant has described them as special items of deductions. Those

paragraphs, i.e. (a) to (w) of S. 23 (1) of the IRA 2000 or S. 25 (1) of the IRA

48

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

2006, which contain specific items of deductions are all outgoings or

expenses within the interpretation adopted by Basnayake C.J. (p. 175) and

Sinnetamby, J. (p. 177) in Healy and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of

Inland Revenue (supra).

[143] I shall now proceed to consider first, whether the legislature

intended that in addition to the general deductions in Section 23 (1)/25 (1)

of the IRA, the sub-sections (a) -(w) allow a catalogue of specific deductions,

when it has already permitted all outgoings and expenses to be deducted

as a general rule subject to the general limitation set out in Section 24/26.

[144] The paramount object of statutory interpretation is to discover the

intention of the legislature and this intention is primarily to be ascertained

from the text of enactment in question (Bindras Interpretation of Statutes,

10th Ed. p. 408). That does not mean that the text is to be construed merely

as a piece of prose, without reference to its nature or purpose and

therefore, as Holmes J. stated in Lenigh Valley Coal Co. v. Yensavage (218

FR 547, 553), statutes should be construed, not as theorems of Euclid, but

with some imagination of the purposes which lie behind them. The

question whether the legislature intended to treat a section to be a general

or special provision has to be discovered by the reader having regard to

the context, purpose or object underlying the Act as a whole rather than

seeking to find express words in a section.

[145] As noted, Basnayake C.J. referring to Section 9 (1) of the Income Tax

Ordinance, which is the corresponding provision of Section 25 (1) has

clearly stated in Hayley v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) that the

deductions allowed by sub-sections (a)-(i) are specific deductions. The

body of Section 23 (1)/25 (1) contains the general deduction formula that

allows the general deduction of all outgoings and expenses incurred in

producing profits or income, which are subject to the general limitations

set out in Section 24/26. In addition to that, the sub-sections (a) to (w) of

Section 23(1)/25 (1) also allow a catalogue of specific deductions in

ascertaining profits or income of any person and Section 23(1)(h)/25(1)(f),

which, allows the deduction of interest paid or payable by such person.

49

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Relationship between sections 23(1)/25 (1), 23(1)(h)/25(1)(f) and

24(g)/26(1)(g)

[146] Now, the question is, if all deductible outgoings and expenses in

Section 23(1)/25 (1) are subject to the limitations set out in Section 24/26,

why did the legislature include several catalogues of other deductions in

several sub-sections (a) -(w) of Section 23(1)/25 (1)? It is inconceivable that

the legislature would have included several other specific items of

deductions in sub-sections (a) -(w) of Section 23(1)/25(1), if all the

outgoings and expenses are restricted to the general limitation provisions

in Section 24/26 of the Act. In order to determine this question, it is

necessary to consider the relationship between Section 23(1)/25 (1) and

Section 24(1)(g)/26(1)(g) of the IRA 2000 or IRA 2006.

Whether the word "including" in Section 23 (1)/25(1) of the Act is expansive in nature or the same is to be read in a restrictive manner

[147] One issue that arose during the hearing was the true and correct

interpretation to be given to the word including at the end of Section

23(1)/25 (1) of the Act. Mr. Goonewardena referred to the decision of this

Court in Geometry Global (Private) Limited v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra) and Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd v. The Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (supra) and argued that the word including

must necessarily be construed to be an expansive meaning and thus, the

specific deduction rule in Section 23(1)(h)/25(1)(f) is not restricted at all by

any general restrictions placed by the general prohibition rules in Section

24(1)(g)/25(1)(g).

[148] The learned State Counsel strongly relied on the decision of this

Court in CEI Plastics Limited v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,

CA Tax 03/2013 decided on 01.02.2019 and submitted that the decision of

the Privy Council in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for Income

Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra) relied on by the Appellant is not applicable

to the present case.

[149] Before I proceed to consider the decisions in CEI Plastics Limited v.

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) and Geometry Global

(Private) Limited v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) and

50

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(supra), I propose to identify the context in which the word including has

been used by the legislature at the end of the body of Section 23(1)/25 (1).

In identifying the relationship between the Sections 23(1)/25 (1), 23(1)(h)

and 24(g)/26(1)(g), it is significant to consider the context in which the word

including has been used by the legislature at the end of the body of

Section 23(1)/25 (1).

[150] The interpretation of the term "including" at the end of the body of

Section 23(1)/25 (1) becomes paramount and therefore, one has to

understand the true intent of the legislature and put a proper construction

to the same. I do not think, however, that there could be any inflexible rule

that the word including or include should be read always as a word of

extension or exhaustion without reference to the context in which it is

used by the legislature. I took the same view in Geometry Global (Private)

Limited v. Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) and Ogilvy

Action (Pvt) Ltd v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra).

[151] It is now necessary to consider the question of whether the word

including in section 23(1)/25 (1) of the Act is to be taken as exhaustive

that includes all the expenses referred to in Section 23(1)/25 (1)(a) -(w) or

it is an extended meaning in the context in which it is used, in addition to

all legitimate deductions. The word "includes" has different meanings in

different contexts. Standard dictionaries assign more than one meaning to

the word "include". Webster's Dictionary defines the word "include" as

synonymous with "comprise" or "contain". Blacks Law Dictionary, p. 905,

word including may, according to context, the expression, an enlargement

and have the meaning of and, or in and addition to or merely specify a

particular thing already included within general words.

Extensive Construction

[152] It is well-settled that when the interpretation clause used an inclusive

definition, it would be generally expansive in nature and thus, it seeks to

enlarge the meaning of the words or phrases used in an interpretation

clause, unless it manifests a contrary intention very clearly (P. M. Bakshi,

Interpretation of Statutes, First Edition, 2008, pp. 242-243). In such case,

the word include must be construed as comprehending, not only such

51

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

things as they signify according to their natural import, but also those

things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include

(Commissioner of Inland Tax v. Banddarawathie Fernando Charitable

Trusts (63 N.L.R 409). It is no doubt true that generally, when the word

"include" is used in a definition clause, -it is used as a word of enlargement,

that is to make the definition extensive and not restrictive

Exhaustive Construction- means and include

[153] Moreover, the words means and includes indicates an exhaustive

explanation of the meaning which, for the purposes of the interpretation

of a statute, must invariably be attached to these words or expressions.

The use of the words, means and includes would, therefore, suggest that

the definition is intended to be exhaustive and not extensive (P. Kasilingam

v. P.S.G. College of Technology, AIR 1995 SC 1395, p. 1400). Lord Watson in

Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps, [1899] A.C. 99, P.C.) stated that it is

susceptible of another construction, which may be imperative if the

concept of the Act is sufficient to show that it was not merely employed for

the purpose of adding to the natural words used. He stated at pp. 105-106:

But the word "include is susceptible of another construction, which may become imperative, if the context of the Act is sufficient to show that it was not merely employed for the purpose of adding to the natural significance of the words or expressions defined. It may be equivalent to "mean and include, and in that case it may afford an exhaustive explanation of the meaning which, for the purposes of the Act, must invariably be attached to these words or expressions

[154] In that sense, the term include would suggest definition to be

exhaustive and not extensive (Reliance Industries Ltd, Bombay v State of

Maharashtra AIR 2006 Bom 213). Thus, the word include may, where

the context so demands, be equivalent to mean and include, in which

case the definition, though apparently inclusive, is to be taken as

exhaustive (Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps).

Enumerative construction-includes

52

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

[155] The third category of construction, the function of the word

includes is merely enumerative and brings under one nomenclature all

transactions possessing certain similar features, but going under

different names (Reserve Bank of India v Peerless General Finance and

Investment Co. Ltd, AIR 1987 SC 1023 p. 1041. This construction was

adopted by Thambiah J. in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Cross Raj

Chandra 67 N.L.R. 174 at p. 179) as the third category of the function of

the word includes and in such cases, the term is placed preceding the

word includes and is followed by a number of other terms which, in

common parlance, may bot connote the term which precedes the word

includes.

[156] As Tambiah J. explained, the word business is defined as Business

includes agricultural undertakings, but in common parlance, agricultural

undertakings will not be construed as business (supra). In this situation,

the setting, context and object of an enactment may provide sufficient

guidance for interpretation of the word includes or including for the

purposes of such enactment. Tambiah, J. after an exhaustive analysis of

cases, recognized these three categories of the function of the word

includes in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Cross Raj Chandra

(supra) and stated at pp. 178-179) that:

1. The word includes is generally used in interpretative clauses in order

to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases occurring in the body of

the statute and when so used these words or phrases must be

construed as comprehending, not only such things as they signify

according to their natural import, but also those things which the

interpretation clause declares that they shall include;

2. But, the word includes is susceptible of another construction, which

may become imperative, if the context of the Act is sufficient to show

that it was not merely employed for the purpose of adding to the

natural significance of the words or expressions defined. It may be

equivalent to mean and include and, in that case, it may afford an

exhaustive explanation of the meaning which, for the purposes of the

Act, must invariably be attached to these words or expressions;

53

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

3. Under the third category, the word includes is merely enumerative

and in such cases, the term is placed preceding the word includes

and is followed by a number of other terms which, in common

parlance, may not connote the term which precedes the word

includes.

[157] For the above decisions, we can infer that the word includes or

including can have the following functions in a statute:

1. The word includes or including is normally used in any statute to

enlarge the scope of the definition or expression to include things that

would not properly fall within its ordinary connotation. In other words,

it is used as an extensive word;

2. If the context of the Act is sufficient to show that it was not merely

employed for the purpose of adding to the natural significance of the

words or expressions defined, it can be also used to give an exhaustive

or restrictive meaning and, in that case, it may be used as equivalent

to means and also means and includes;

3. The setting, context and object of an enactment, may provide

sufficient guidance for interpretation of the word includes for the

purpose of such enactment bringing under one nomenclature all

transactions possessing certain similar features but going under

different names.

The Principle of Construction in Patrick Reynolds v. Income Tax

Commissioner for Trinidad and Tobago-Principle

[158] Now, I will deal with the decision in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v.

Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra), which was

relied on by Mr. Goonewardena. It proceeded to construe the word

including and the relationship between the general deduction,

prohibition of deduction and the specific deduction rules in ascertaining

the profits or income of a taxpayer under the Income Tax Ordinance

(Income Tax Ordinance (Laws of Trinidad and Tobago). In the said case,

both the Appellant and his wife (Mrs. Reynolds) had at all material times

54

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

been living together and had been in receipt of income from earnings and

investment. Mrs. Reynolds entered into a deed of covenant under which

she undertook to make annual payments to a trustee for the benefit of

the four children of the marriage. The Appellants return of income for the

relevant year of assessment showed a total income received in the

preceding year of $ 40,164.86 of which $ 18,202 represented Mrs.

Reynolds income. The Appellant claimed that the aggregate sum of $

14,000 paid by Mrs. Reynolds under the deed of covenant should be

deducted from her income in computing the Appellants chargeable

income.

[159] Main issues that arose for the determination in the said cases were

as follows:

1. Whether Section 10 (1), on its true construction and having regard

to the word including was a word of extension?

2. If so, whether it was intended to embrace the deductions specified

in sub-paragraphs (a) to (k) of Section 10(1), in addition to all

legitimate deductions of expenses incurred in the production of

income;

3. If so, whether the prohibition of deduction in Section 12 (1) (b)

negatived the provisions of Section 10 (1(f);

4. Whether annual payments under deed of covenant was deductible

from assessment of husbands income; and

5. Whether the wife was the disponer within Section 34 (2) of the

Income Tax Ordinance of Trinidad and Tobago.

[160] The Privy Council considered the issue whether the general

limitation in Section 12 (1) (f), which prohibited the general deduction

under Section 10 (1), intended to take away specific deduction that has

been expressly provided under Section 10 (1) (f) of the Income Tax

Ordinance (Laws of Trinidad and Tobago). Section 10 (1) of the Income

Tax Ordinance (Laws of Trinidad and Tobago) contains a similar structure

to Section 25 (1) of the Act and at the end of the body of the said Section,

refers to the word including as follows:

55

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

10 (1) -For the purpose of ascertaining the chargeable income of any person, there shall be deducted all outgoings and expenses wholly and exclusively incurred during the year preceding the year of assessment by such person in the production of the income, including........ [emphasis added]

[161] Then, there are sub-paragraphs (a) to (k) of Section 10 (1) which sets

out examples of permissible deductions and sub-paragraph (f) of Section

10 (1) allowed annuities to be deducted. It reads:

10 (1) (F) - annuities or other annual payments, whether payable within or out of the Colony, either as a charge on any property of the person paying the same by virtue of any deed or will or otherwise, or as a reservation thereout, or as a personal debt or obligation by virtue of any contract: Provided that no voluntary allowances or payment of any description shall be deducted.

[162] On the other hand, Section 12 (1) deals with the prohibition of

deduction rule and disallowed disbursements or expenses not being

money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purpose of

acquiring income. It reads as follows:

For the purpose of ascertaining the chargeable income of any person, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of (a) domestic or private expenses; (b) any disbursements or expenses not being money wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purpose of acquiring the income.... f) rent of or cost of repairs to any premises or part of premises not paid or incurred for the purpose of acquiring the income...

[163] The Privy Council considered the question whether the use of the

word including at the end of the body of Section 10 (1) would be

expansive or restrictive in nature in the context of the prohibition of

deduction under Section 12 (1) (b). Lord Hodson stated at p. 11:

In looking at this section as a whole, including all its sub-paragraphs, their Lordships have already noticed that not all of the sub-paragraphs appear to be directly aimed at what may broadly be called trade, business of profession and they are of the opinion that the language of sub-paragraph (f), in particular the reference to a will

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

points to the conclusion that (f) is looking at something which is not necessarily a business and that the conception of the production of the income is inappropriate and certainly not necessary to be regarded as a provision which governs this subparagraph. Their Lordships, therefore reading the word including broadly have reached the same conclusion as Blagden J. at first instance, following the decision of Gilchrist J. in an earlier case of an appeal in Trinidad by one Joseph Galvan Kelshall (No. 443 of 1939). This construction as Gilchrist J. pointed out is supported by the fact that in sub-paragraph (f) there are no limiting words referring specifically to the acquiring of income, such as appear in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of the same section. Further, this construction is not inconsistent with section 12 which read together with section 10, is of limited application and does not take away that which has been expressly provided by section 10(1)(f) (emphasis added)

[164] The decision in Reynolds v. Income Tax Commissioner for Trinidad

and Tobago (supra) established the following propositions in the

interpretation of the functions of the word including in a similarly

structured Act that:

1. The use of the word including in Section 10 (1) was a word of

extension and intended to embrace the deductions specified in sub-

paragraphs (a) to (k) of Section 10 (1), in addition to all legitimate

deductions of expenses expressly provided by Section 10 (1) (f)

unless the words are limited by the provisions of the Act.

2. The word "Including" is generally used to enlarge the meaning of the

preceding word (Reynolds v. Income Tax Commissioner for Trinidad

and Tobago [1966] 1 W.L.R. 19), however, it depends on the setting,

context and the object in which it is used in any statute in its entirety

and the purpose of the statute intended by the legislature;

3. Depending on the question referred to in (2) above, the word

"including" may be intended to clarify or explain or restrict the

definition in an exhaustive manner, or add or extend the definition

in an extensive manner;

57

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

4. Section 10 (1), on its true construction, and having regard to the word

including which was a word of extension, was intended to embrace

the deductions specified in sub-paragraphs (a) to (k) in addition to all

legitimate deductions of expenses incurred in the production of

income;

5. Section 12(1) (b) which was of limited application, did not negative or

fetter the provisions of section 10 (1) (f) of the Income Tax Ordinance

(Laws of Trinidad and Tobago).

[165] The principle emanating from this analysis is that (i) the word

"Including" is generally used to enlarge the meaning of the preceding

word, but whether it is expensive or restrictive depends on the setting,

context and the object in which it is used in any statute in its entirety and

the purpose of the statute intended by the legislature; and (ii) while the

general deduction rule is restricted by the prohibition of the deduction

rule, any deduction provision which has been specifically provided by any

statute is not taken away by the general prohibition of deduction unless it

is expressly prohibited by the provisions of the statute.

Rodrigo v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

[166] The Supreme Court in Rodrigo v. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (supra) stated that Section 24 (1) (g) read with Section 23 (1) of the

Act, show that-

(a) all outgoings and expenses incurred by a person in the production of

income from any source could be incurred as deductions-Section

23(1);

(b) any disbursement or expenses which was not spent for the purpose

of production of profits and income cannot be deducted as specified

in Section 24(1)(g).

[167] Bandaranayake, J. held at pp. 391-392 and 394 in Rodrigo v.

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (supra) that Sections 23/25 and

24/26 should be read together as both sections apply to the deductibility

from income. The relevant findings are as follows:

58

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Sections 23 (1) and 24 of the Act have to be read together as both provisions apply to the deductibility from the income. While section 23 spells out the permissible expenses, section 24 expressly disallows the whole or part of certain expenses, which if not so prohibited, would be allowable deductions. The combined effect of sections 23 and 24 therefore is to divide all outgoings and expenses into two categories; outgoing expenses which are deductible and not deductible. ...(p. 391)

Taking both these Sections together, in their literal context, it appears that the meanings of words in Section 23(1) is restricted by the words given in Section 24 (1) (g) of the Act..(p. 392).

1. However, it would be necessary to give a meaning to the words in section 24 (1) (g) of the Act. If any part of the expenses could be clearly identified as having being expended for the purpose of deriving money not being profits or income liable to tax, such amount could not be deducted in terms of section 24 (1) (g). Specific expenses relating to the earning of exempt income are given as an example for such a situation (p. 394).

[168] Having identified the combined effect of the two sections, the

Supreme Court held that the general deduction provision in Section 23 (1)

is restricted by the general prohibition provision in Section 24 (1) (g) and

thus, although all outgoings and expenses incurred are deducted under

Section 23 (1), any amount which was not expended for the purpose of

producing the income cannot be deducted (p. 395). The words the

meanings of words in Section 23 (1) are restricted by the words given in

Section 24 (1) (g) of the Act as stated by the Supreme Court are consistent

with the scheme of Section 25 (1) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006,

which is the general deduction provision and 26 of the Inland Revenue Act,

No. 10 of 2006, is the general prohibition of deduction.

[169] Accordingly, the general deduction provision in Section 25 (1) as

relates to all outgoings and expenses are restricted by the general

prohibition of deduction in section 26 (1) and (2). This means that even if

they fall within Section 23(1)/25 (1), it is necessary to consider whether they

would still be excluded under Section 24/26 for the purpose of the general

deductibility or general limitations on deductibility as

59

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

[170] This principle that Sections 25 (1) and 26 should be read together on

the basis of the judgment in Rodrigo v. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (supra) is consistent with the position taken by the Court of Appeal

in Global (Private) Limited v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

(supra) and Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd v. The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (supra).

[171] However, the Supreme Court in Rodrigo v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra), was not invited to consider the interpretation of

the Privy Council decision in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for

Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra) or the relationship between any

specific deduction provision such as Section 25 (1) (f) and the general

prohibition on deduction provision such as Section 26 (1) in the present

case. This aspect was also not considered in CEI Plastic v. The Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (supra).

CEI Plastic Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax

[172] The decision in CEI Plastic Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax

(supra) is identical to this case. His Lordship Janak de Silva, J. cited with

approval the entire passage of the judgment delivered by Tambiah J. at pp.

413-414 (Vide- paragraph 56 of this judgment) and two other judgments of

the Supreme Court, namely, The Commissioner of Income Tax v.

Baddrawathie Fernando Charitable Trust (63 N.L.R. 409) and The Ceylon

Tea Propaganda Board v. The Commissioner of Income Tax (67 N.L.R. 1).

Having referred to those judgments and Section 25 (1) and sub-section 25

(1) (f) stated that:

1. The word includes can have different meaning in the context in which

it is used;

2. Our courts have not uniformly given the word including an extended

meaning and has instead on some occasions interpreted the word

includes as the equivalent of means.

[173] His Lordship referred to the decision of this Court in ICIC Bank Limited

v. The Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue (C.A. Tax 28/2013 C.A.M.

16.07.2015) that interpreted that (i) the phrase all outgoings and expenses

incurred by such person in the production thereof means the outgoings

60

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

and expenses incurred for the purpose of generating the taxable income;

and (ii) the word thereof referred to the income generated by expending

the said outgoings and the expenses. Having followed the above-

mentioned approach taken by Bandaranayake J. in Rodrigo v. The

Commissioner General of Income Tax (supra), Janak de Silva, J. proceeded

to pronounce that it is not possible to give the word includes in Section 25

(1) of the Act an extended meaning in the context in which it is used at p.

11 as follows:

Sections 23 (1) and 24 (1) (g) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 corresponds to sections 25 (1) and 26 (1) (g) of the Act and it is a trite rule of interpretation that the interpretation given by courts to similar words in the previous act is applicable when the same words in the new act is interpreted. Accordingly, it is not possible to give the word includes in section 25 (1) of the Act an extended meaning in the context in which it is used and I hold that the interest incurred by the Appellant to the value of Rs. 167,075,212/- in relation to its business of share trading is not deductible for the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of the Appellant from the profits of its other business of manufacturing and selling plastic items.

[174] The Court of Appeal in CEI Plastic Limited v. Commissioner of Income

Tax (supra) did not, however, consider the question whether or not, in

addition to the general deduction formula in Section 25 (1), one or more

sub-sections of Section 25 (1) is a specific deduction formula and if so,

whether or not the combined effect of Section 25 (1) and Section 26 (1) (g)

takes away such specific deduction formula expressly provided by Section

25 (1) (f). This Court in Global (Private) Limited v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra) and Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd v. The Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (supra) specifically considered this legal position

in the context of the decision in Reynolds v. Income Tax Commissioner for

Trinidad and Tobago (supra) in detail.

[175] The decision in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for Income

Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra) should be read together with the

qualification identified by Lord Hodson at the end of the passage at p. 11

(Vide- paragraph 162 of the judgment) that unless it is expressly

prohibited by the provisions of the statute or the effect of such

61

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

specific provision has been otherwise limited by the provisions of the

same statute.

[176] Geometry Global (Private) Limited v. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (supra) and Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd v. The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue (supra) related to the deductibility of the actual travelling expenses

incurred by a taxpayer or any person in his employment in travelling in

connection with the trade, business as provided in section 25(1) (k). The

general deduction provision in section 26(2) in that case disallowed any

sum for depreciation by wear and tear or for renewal, or any allowance

under paragraph (a) or paragraph (c) of subsection (1) of section 25 in

relation to any rental or annual payments in respect of such vehicle

referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b). The Court considered the following

questions: (i) whether or not Section 25 (1) (k) is a specific deduction

provision and if so, its relationship and effect of section 26 (2) on the specific

deduction provision; (ii) whether the specific deduction provision in section

25(1)(k) is taken away by the general limitation provision in section 26(2);

and (iii) whether the general deduction rule is intended to interfere with the

specific provision unless it manifests a contrary intention in the provisions

of the Act.

[177] Articulated in this broad analysis, it is not always necessary that the

word 'including' would convey expansiveness nor is it necessary that the

word 'including' shall always be interpreted to include, within its sweep,

such items, which may not be generally included within the term, which is

sought to be defined by using the word 'including'. It is in this context, I

stated in Geometry Global (Private) Limited v. Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (supra) that in construing the meaning of including in the

context in which it is used as regards travelling expenses referred to in

Section 25(1)(k) read with section 26(2) at paragraph 73:

The courts in interpreting the word includes or including are not adopting any uniform rule and thus, sometimes, the word includes may be extensive or sometimes exhaustive. But whether the meaning of the word including is extensive in nature (a phrase of extension) or exhaustive in nature (a phrase of restriction), depends on the setting, context and object in which it is used in any statute in its entirety and the purpose of the statute intended by the legislature. Depending on that, the word "including" may be

62

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

intended to clarify or explain or restrict the definition in an exhaustive manner, or add or extend the definition in an extensive manner.

[178] Further, in Geometry Global (Private) Limited v. Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (supra) at p.80, this Court considered the

relationship between the specific deduction and the general prohibition of

deduction, and the test to be applied in the context of the decision in Patrick

Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra)

as follows:

A general deduction read together with a general prohibition of deduction, does not take away what has been expressly provided by any specific deduction unless it is otherwise provided in the Act. In my view, the above principle in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra) is of a highest persuasive authority and applies in interpreting similarly structured general deduction rule in Section 25 (1) and the prohibition of deduction in Section 26 when a specific deduction formula has been expressly provided by a tax statute, unless the effect of such specific provision has been otherwise limited by the provisions of the same statute (emphasis added). Nature and Character of Expenses incurred by the Appellant

[179] It is now necessary to consider whether the interest expenses

incurred and claimed by the Appellant fall within the ambit of the

deduction under Section 23(1)(h)/25 (1)(f) or under the prohibition of

deduction under Section 24(1)(g)/26 (1) (g).

[180] As stated, the question whether or not, the word including in

section 23(1)/25(1) is extensive or restrictive depends on the context in

which it is used in the combined effect of the specific deduction formula

specified in Section 23(1)(h)/25(1)(f) and the general prohibition of

deduction formula in Section 24(1)(g)/26(1)(g), and where a contrary

intention is expressed in the scheme of the Act, the word including may

not be given an extended meaning.

[181] In the said two cases [(Global (Private) Limited v. Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue (supra) and Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd v. The

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra)], the Court examined the

63

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

effect of Section 25(1)(k) and Section 26(2) and held that in the context in

which the provisions are used in the Act, the specific deduction provision

in Section 25(1)(k) is not taken away by the general deduction rule in

Section 26(2) as the provisions of the Act did not expressly or by

implication take away the effect of the specific deduction provision in

Section 25(1)(k).

[182] It is to be noted that in Hayley v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue

(supra) however, the question whether or not the outgoings must be

limited by the words incurred in the production of profits or income was

not conclusively decided as there was a disagreement between

Basnayake, C.J. and Sinnetamby, J. on this question. In this context, in

Geometry Global (Private) Limited v. Commissioner-General of Inland

Revenue (supra) and Ogilvy Action (Pvt) Ltd v. The Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue (supra), while holding that the general deduction under

Section 25 (1) shall be read with the general prohibition of deduction in

Section 26, this Court held that the specific deduction will prevail unless

the effect of such specific provision has been otherwise limited by the

provisions of the same statute.

[183] The deduction allowed under Section 23(1)/25(1) relates to all

outgoings and expenses, incurred by a taxpayer in the production of

profits or income of such person, including the interest paid or payable

under paragraph (f) of Section 23(1)/25(1). As stated in the case Hayley

and Company Ltd v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra), in order to

be qualified for deduction under Section 23(1)/25 (1), it must have been

all outgoings and expenses incurred in the production of the profits or

income, that must be deducted to ascertain such a profit (see- the

language in S. 23 (1)/25(1). This means in the present case, all expenses

that have been incurred in the business of manufacturing and selling of

plastic items in ascertaining the profits or income of the said business.

[184] In my view, Section 24(1) (g) or Section 26 (1) (g) of the Act prescribes

a negative test of deductibility and prohibits deductions in respect of all

outgoings or expenses specified in Section 23(1)/25(1) of the Act. This

means that even if they fall within Section 23(1)/25 (1), it is necessary to

consider whether they would still be excluded under Section 24/26 for the

64

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

purpose of the general deductibility or general limitations on deductibility

as Bandaranayake, J. held at p. 391 in Rodrigo v. Commissioner-General

of Inland Revenue (supra).

[185] Section 24(g)/26(1)(g) expressly prohibits the deduction of expenses

and disbursements not incurred in the production of profits or

income in ascertaining the profits such person. The Appellant has

taken loans and overdraft facilities from banks for its share trading

activities, which is a separate business and calculated the profit of the

share trading business by deducting the interest expenses from the

income of the share trading business. The Appellant has charged such

interest expenses of the share trading business to the profits and loss

account in arriving at the profits and income from the manufacturing and

selling plastic items.

[186] The Privy Council in Patrick Alfred Reynolds v. Commissioner for

Income Tax, Trinidad & Tobago (supra) however, dismissed the appeal on

different grounds. The Privy Council was of the view that the payments to

the trust for the maintenance and benefits of a taxpayers children are

within the prohibition of Section 12 (1) (b) which prohibits any

disbursements or expenses not being money wholly and exclusively laid

out or expended for the purpose of acquiring the income. Hayley v.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (supra) considered the question

whether the loss suffered by the burglary was an outgoing under

Section 9 (1) of the Income Tax Ordinance of Ceylon for the purpose of

ascertaining the profits or income of the Company from its trade or

business.

[187] In the present case, the interest expenses related to the share

trading activities that had been charged to the profit and loss account in

arriving at profits from manufacturing and selling plastic items. It is not in

dispute that the Appellants share trading activities fall within the meaning

of section 13 (t) which exempts share trading business from income tax.

It is crystal clear that the interest expenses incurred by the appellant

relate to the loans and overdrafts obtained for separate share trading

activities of the Appellant and not for the production of profits or income

in respect of the core business of manufacturing and selling plastic items.

65

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

The deduction provided for in Section 23(1)(h)/25(1)(f) in relation to

interest paid or payable by a taxpayer has been otherwise limited or

expressly taken away by the prohibition of deduction in Section

24(1)(g)/26(1)(g) in ascertaining the profits or income of the Appellant.

Accordingly, such interest expenses cannot be deducted for the purpose

of deriving the profits or income of the business of manufacturing and

selling plastic items under Section 24 (1)(g)/26(1)(g).

[188] Therefore, the cases decided by in Geometry Global (Private)

Limited v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra) and Ogilvy

Action (Pvt) Ltd v The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (supra)

can be distinguished from the facts of this case. The reasoning except the

manner in which this Court broadly considered the relationship between

the general deduction provision, the general prohibition on deduction

provision and the specific deduction provision and the circumstances

under which the word including in section 25(1) is applied, is consistent

with the decision in CEI Plastic Limited v. Commissioner of Income Tax

(supra).

[189] For those reasons, I hold that it is not possible to construe an

extensive meaning to the word including in section 23(1)/25(1) in the

present case, in the context in which it is used in Section 23(1)(h)/25(1)(f)

and 24(1)(g)/26(1)(g) of the Inland Revenue Act.

[190] For those reasons, I hold that the interest incurred by the Appellant

to the value of Rs. 52,479,103 for the year of assessment 2005/2006 in

terms of section 23 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 38 of 2000 cannot be

deducted for the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of the

Appellant from the profits of its business of manufacturing and selling

plastic items. For those reasons, I hold that the interest incurred by the

Appellant to the value of Rs. 122,406,640 for the year of assessment

2006/2007 in terms of section 25 of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006

cannot be deducted for the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income

of the Appellant from the profits of its business of manufacturing and

selling plastic items.

Question of Law 4-6

66

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

Deductibility of the interest incurred by the Appellant under Section

29(2) of the IRA, No. 30 of 2000 or section 32 (5) of the IRA, No. 10 of

2006

[191] The next question is to consider whether the interest expenses

incurred by the Appellant to the value of Rs. 52,479,103 and Rs.

122,406,640 is deductible in determining the assessable income of the

Appellant under Section 29 (2) of the IRA 2000 or Section 32 (5) of the IRA

2006.

[192] It was the contention of Mr. Goonewardena that Section 29(2) of the

IRA 2000 and Section 32(5) of the IRA 2006 specifically provide for the

deductibility of the interest expenses provided that certain criteria are

satisfied, and that these two Sections do not refer to any specific

principles set out in Sections 23/25 of the IRA 2000 and 24/26 of the IRA

2006 relating to the requirement of being incurred in the production of a

particular source of income. He further submitted that the Finance

Controller of the Appellant has indicated the actual interest which was

paid by the Company for the relevant year and thus, based on the

decision in ICICI Bank Ltd v. CGIR (supra), the interest expenses should

have been deductible under Section 29(2) of the IRA 2000 or Section 32

(5) of the IRA 2006.

[193] The learned State Counsel, however, submitted that the Appellant

has already calculated the profits of the share trading business in order

to claim the tax exemption provided for in Section 13 (t) and deducted the

interest expenses from the income of the share trading business in terms

of section 23/25 of the Inland Revenue Act and therefore, the Appellant is

not entitled to deduct the interest expenses under Section 29(2)/32(5) of

the Act.

[194] Section 29(2) of the IRA 2000 is identical to Section 32 (5) of the IRA

2006. It reads as follows:

There shall be deducted from the total statutory income of a person

for any year of assessment

67

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

(a) sums paid by such person for that year of assessment by way of

annuity or interest not deductible under Section 25. For the purposes of this paragraph, interest does not include the excess referred to in paragraph (x) or paragraph (y) of subsection (1) of section 26:

Provided that-

(i) no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any such sum paid, unless the Assessor or Assistant Commissioner is satisfied that the recipient of such payment has issued a valid receipt for such payment, containing name, address and the income tax file number (if any) of such person in Sri Lanka or that the tax has been deducted under this Act before or at the time such payment is made; no deduction shall be allowed

(ii) (ii) where for any year of assessment any such sum paid and deductible under this subsection exceeds the total statutory income for that year, the excess shall be treated for the purposes of this section, in the same manner as a loss incurred in a trade during that year

(iii) (iii) where any sum is paid by such person by way of an annuity, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of such annuity, unless such annuity is paid..............

[195] In terms of these two provisions, the interest expenses which are

not deductible under section 23 or 25 can be deducted from the total

statutory income of the taxpayer subject to several conditions. In the

present case, the Appellant has already calculated the profit of the share

trading business and deducted the interest expenses of the share trading

business, which is exempted from income tax in terms of Section 15 (v) of

the IRA 2000 and Section 13 (t) of the IRA 2006. Accordingly, the question

of the deductability of interest expenses on share trading under Section

29(2) or Section 32 (5) of the Act will not arise.

[196] The Appellant however, strongly relies on Section 32 (5)(a) (iv) of the

IRA 2006. For the application of this subsection, the Assessor or Assistant

Commissioner must be satisfied with factual matters, namely, that the

recipient of such payment has issued a valid receipt for such payment,

68

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

containing name, address and the income tax file number (if any) of such

person in Sri Lanka or that the tax has been deducted under this Act

before or at the time such payment is made. It has been submitted in the

written submissions filed on behalf of the Appellant that the Finance

Controller of the Appellant has produced an affidavit with confirmation

with the relevant proof under the Banking Act as required by Section 32

(5)(a) (iv). A perusal of the TAC brief reveals that the affidavit of the Finance

Controller of the Appellant has only been submitted to the Tax Appeals

Commission on 22.11.2016 with letters issued on a letterhead of the

Commercial Bank, Sampath Bank, Nations Trust Bank, DFCC Bank in the

year 2008. The letter of the State Bank of India is dated 29.07.2015 and

thus, it has been issued long after the assessments and the determination

made by the Respondent.

[197] There is nothing to indicate, however, that any of the documents

issued by the Banks had been submitted to the Assessor or the

Assistant Commissioner as required by Section 32 (5) (a) (iv) on or about

the time the assessments were made by the Assessor or the

Assistant Commissioner and the appeal was decided by the

Respondent. Had those letters been, in fact addressed to the Assessor or

the Assistant Commissioner, the Appellant could have produced these

letters sent to the Assessor and the Assistant Commissioner during the

assessment process or the appeal process before the Respondent. Unless

the relevant documents set out in the said subsection are produced

before the Assessor or the Assistant Commissioner, and the Assessor or

Assistant Commissioner is satisfied with the rerlevant recipient of such

payments, no deduction under this section can be allowed.

[198] There was nothing before the Assessor or the Assistant

Commissioner to be satisfied at the inquiry with any valid receipts issued

for payment containing the details as required by Section 32 (5)(a)(iv) and

that factual matters referred to in the said subsection were not gone into

by the Assessor or the Assistant Commissioner either during the

assessment or the appeal process. The Appellant has clearly failed to

maintain and keep or maintain separate accounts and produce valid

receipts for payment at the inquiry before the Assessor or the Assistant

Commissioner. The Appellant cannot be heard to say that those

69

CA TAX 0010 -2017 TAC/OLD/IT/035

documents were produced before the Tax Appeals Commission with an

affidavit based on the decision in ICIC Bank v. CGIR (supra) when the same

was produced before the Tax Appeals Commission long after the

assessments were made, and the appeal was decided by the Respondent

contrary to the legal obligation set out in Section 32(5)(a)(iv) of the Inland

Revenue Act.

[199] I hold that the Appellant has not satisfied the conditions for the

applicability of the deduction as set out in Section 29 (2)/32 (5) (a) (iv) of

the Inland Revenue Act and accordingly, the Appellant cannot seek to

deduct the interest expenses incurred in terms of the Section 29(2) of the

IRA 2000 or Section 32 (5) of the IRA 2006.

Conclusion & Opinion of Court

[200] In these circumstances, I answer Questions of Law arising in the

case stated in favour of the Respondent and against the Appellant as

follows:

1. No. 2. No 3. No 4. No 5. No 6. No 7. No

[201] For those reasons, I confirm the determination made by the Tax

Appeals Commission dated 14.02.2017 and the Registrar is directed to

send a certified copy of this judgment to the Tax Appeals Commission.
