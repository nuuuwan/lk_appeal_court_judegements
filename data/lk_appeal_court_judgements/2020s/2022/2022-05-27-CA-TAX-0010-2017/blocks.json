In the case of statutes that are said to be imperative, the Courts have decided that if it is not done the whole thing fails, and the proceedings that follow upon it are all voids. On the other hand, when the Courts hold a provision to be mandatory or directory, they say that, although such provision may not have been complied with, the subsequent proceedings do not fail. Still, whatever the language, the idea is a perfectly distinct one. There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the Court to be of that material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that the",

A person who buys an object which subsequently turns out to be worth more than he gave for it, and which he sells, does not thereby make a profit or gain for income tax purposes. But he can organize himself to do that in a commercial and mercantile way, and the profits, which emerge are taxable profits, not of the transaction, both of the trade. In the same way, he may carry on the trade of selling things which he has not got and buying them when the price has fallen. That is a capital accretion, only the operations are reversed. He sells first and buys afterwards. And in that way, he may make losses or he may make profits. If he makes losses, the losses cannot be said to be the results of the individual acts; they are the results of the trade as a whole. Test it in this way. A person may organize an effort to find things. He may start a salvage or exploring undertaking and he may make profits. The profits are not the profits of the findings, they are the profits of the adventure as a whole. Again, he may make a loss. One cannot say that the loss was due to the failure to find. The loss is due to the trade. That is a good test, because it shows the difference between the trade as an organism and the individual acts.",

This construction as Gilchrist J. pointed out is supported by the fact that in sub-paragraph (f) there are no limiting words referring specifically to the acquiring of income, such as appear in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (h) of the same section. Further, this construction is not inconsistent with section 12 which read together with section 10, is of limited application and does not take away that which has been expressly provided by section 10(1)(f) (emphasis added)",
