This is an appeal filed against the order of the Provincial High Court of Southern

Province holden in Matara dated 04.03.2021 which affirmed the Matara

Magistrates Courts order to confiscate the appellants vehicle under the Forest

Ordinance, No. 16 of 1907 (as amended) dated 18.09.2018. The petitioner has

invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to set aside both orders and

thereby set aside the confiscation of vehicle bearing registration No. 227-6258

(hereinafter the vehicle).

On 20.04.2015, the vehicle was taken into custody for violation of the Forest

Ordinance by transporting timber without a licence. The accused pleaded guilty,

and a fine was imposed. An inquiry was commenced on 07.06.2016 to show cause

as to why the vehicle should not be confiscated. At the inquiry the petitioner who

is the registered owner of the vehicle, appeared as the claimant. After the

conclusion of submissions, the learned Magistrate held that the appellant had

failed to take all precautions to prevent the commission of the offence, and

ordered the vehicle to be confiscated under Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance.

Aggrieved by the said decision, the petitioner filed a revision application in the

High Court, which affirmed the order of the learned Magistrate and dismissed the

application. The appellant now seeks the setting aside of these impugned Orders.

Both parties have agreed to proceed in the instant case by way of tendering only

written submissions.

For ease of reference, Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance (as amended) which

provides for confiscation of vehicles connected with a forest offence, is quoted

below:

Where any person is convicted of a forest offence-

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in

respect of which such offence has been committed; and

CA-PHC-09-2021 Page 4 of 6 04/10/2022 IJ-39-21

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence,

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be

confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is a

third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves

to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to

prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines,

as the case may be, for the commission of the offence." (Emphasis

added)

As such, the legislature has unequivocally cast a burden on a claimant of a

vehicle inquiry under the Forest Ordinance to dispense the burden of proving to

the satisfaction of the Court that he/she, having ownership of the vehicle

concerned, had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle for the

commission of the offence. Hence, the primary contention to be decided by this

Court is whether the learned Magistrate has correctly evaluated the evidence

placed before him when arriving at the final determination that the petitioner has

failed to dispense the said burden.

The learned Magistrate, in delivering the impugned order, has firstly examined

whether the petitioner has sufficiently established ownership to the vehicle,

which is followed by an evaluation of the submissions made by the petitioner in

relation to the precautionary steps taken by him. Even if the Amendment No. 65

of 2009 has not been mentioned by name, the requirement in the proviso to

Section 40(1) of the owner of the vehicle having to take all necessary precautions

to prevent the commission of an offence, has been adequately discussed by the

learned Magistrate and thereafter by the learned High Court Judge.

The learned Magistrate has also referred to certain omissions and contradictions

in the evidence tendered by the petitioner to hold that the petitioner has failed to

satisfactorily dispense the burden cast on him under the proviso to Section 40(1).

CA-PHC-09-2021 Page 5 of 6 04/10/2022 IJ-39-21

Both the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge have identified

that comprehensive instructions have been given and steps have been taken by

the petitioner, by his own admission, only to prevent the usual driver of the

vehicle, one Gangodage Lal from using the vehicle to undertake any unauthorized

and illegal activities. No such instructions were given, nor steps taken when the

petitioner left a property which he so meticulously attended to, with his friend

Nilantha. The petitioner has only asked the accused Nilantha, to inform him if

the driver requests the vehicle in his absence, and has never instructed the

accused not to use it for any adverse purpose. And no credible reason has been

alluded to by the petitioner as to the necessity of leaving the vehicle along with

the key with the accused, as opposed to with the usual driver or at the owners

home. The petitioner only pleads his ignorance of such use of his vehicle by the

accused. However, this does not suffice to satisfy the Court of the high standard

of care expected from an owner that all precautions have been taken to avert the

very incident that has transpired.

Further contradictions are evident when perusing the evidence tendered by the

petitioner at the Magistrates Court. At the examination-in-chief, the petitioner

has denied that he usually hands over the vehicle to the accused when the

petitioner is away, and has denied that the accused has ever driven the vehicle

before (page 104 of the Appeal Brief). However, at the re-examination, the

petitioner has contradicted himself by stating that he usually leaves the vehicle

in the care of the accused (page 114 of the Appeal Brief). The petitioner has not

presented additional evidence to corroborate his stance. This raises a question

as to the bona fides of the petitioner and tilts the scale of balance of probability

in detriment to the petitioner.

As per the precedent set by the vast body of case law, the crux of the matter in

such cases revolves upon whether or not the owner of a vehicle successfully

satisfies the Court that he/she has taken all necessary precautions to prevent

the misuse of their vehicle on a balance of probability favourable to them.

As held by the Supreme Court in The Finance Company PLC v. Agampodi

Mahapedige Priyantha Chandana and others (2010) 2 Sri L.R. 220, it

CA-PHC-09-2021 Page 6 of 6 04/10/2022 IJ-39-21

would be necessary for the owner of the vehicle to establish that the vehicle that

had been used for the commission of the offence had been so used without his

knowledge and that the owner had taken all precautions available to prevent the

use of the vehicle for the commission of such an offence. (Emphasis added)

The then Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, PC. in Orient Financial Services

Corporation Ltd. v. Range Forest Officer, Ampara and Another, SC Appeal

No. 120/2011 (SC Minutes 10.12.2013), opined that, the registered owner

who has the control over the vehicle is required to satisfy court that he had taken

precautions to prevent the commission of the offences and that the offence was

committed without his knowledge.

Therefore, it is apparent that in the present case, even if the petitioner was

unaware/had no knowledge of the use of his vehicle to commit and offence, he

should also be successful in establishing on a balance of probability, that he has

taken all possible precautions to prevent the commission of an offence. For

instance, like entering into a verbal or a written agreement with the accused as

to not utilizing the vehicle for committing any offence. But as such evidence of

instructions given or steps taken by the petitioner to prevent the accused from

using the vehicle for transporting timber has not been established on a balance

of probability, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge in affirming the Order of the Magistrates Court.

Appeal dismissed.
