MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application is filed to obtain bail to the Suspect namely Angage Amila

Swarnajith Perera under the provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of

Victims of Crime Witnesses Act nu 14 of 2015.

The Presidents Counsel appearing for the suspect stated that the virtual

complainant and the suspect has been having an affair and due to some

misunderstanding the complainant had lodged several complaints against the

suspect for harassment and while these were pending the complainant had

lodged a complaint in 2021 January for an alleged threat by the suspect made

to the complainant and the police had reported facts under the above act and

the suspect is in remand ever since for over a period of one and a half years

without any action being taken against the suspect.

The Counsel appearing for the Attorney General objected to the instant

application on the basis that there are several complaints made against the

suspect.

The Counsel for the respondents further averred that the indictment in the

instant matter is under consideration but was unable to state a date as to when

it would be filed.

Upon considering the submissions of both parties this Court is mindful of the

fact that bail in the instant matter can be granted only upon exceptional

circumstances by this Court, but the term exceptional has not been defined in

the relevant act. But according to the cases so far decided it has been concluded

that exceptional circumstances differ from case to case.

As such in the instant matter we observe that the suspect has been in remand

for more than one year without any charges being filed against the suspect.

According to the provisions of the above mentioned act it is very clearly stated

that action filed under this act should be given precedence over other matters.

But in the instant matter we observe that it has been grossly violated and we

also note that although this act is enacted to safe guard the rights of victims and

witnesses it should not be used as a tool against any person to avenge personal

grievances.

Therefore the period in remand without due administration of justice being

meted out to the suspect we conclude to be exceptional enough to enlarge the

suspect on following conditions of bail,

1) A cash bail of Rs 50000/, 2) Two sureties to the value of Rs 100000/ each 3) The suspect to report to the relevant police station on every last Sunday

of the month, 4) The suspect is severely warned not to interfere with the complainant or

her family, and if he does and if it is reported the instant application for bail would be cancelled.

As such the instant application is allowed and the Registrar of this Court is

directed to inform the above order to the Registrar of the relevant

Magistrates Court.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.
