This appeal has been filed by the Regional Manager, Production Manager

and Assistant Production Manager (hereinafter the appellants) of Manthai

Salt Ltd (Incorporation No. M. N. (P.P.S) 947) who have been named as

accused in Case No 25646 of the Magistrate Court of Mannar for

committing offences punishable under the Food Act No. 26 of 1980 as

amended by Act No. 20 of 1991 and Act No. 29 of 2011 (hereinafter the

Act). The first appellant has passed away, and the remaining appellants

maintain this appeal. The genesis of this case dated to 13.11.2009 when

the sole proprietor of Aarokya Industries and Marketing Services of

Mannar lodged a complaint with the Public Health Inspector (hereinafter

the respondent) regarding the purchase of 1,500kg of salt from Manthai

Salt Ltd and the inferior qualities of the said salt. The government analyst

report dated 20.05.2010 confirmed that the samples sent for analysis do

not conform to the Food (Iodization Salt) Regulations 2005 made by gazette

extraordinary No. 1405/3 dated 11.08.2005 and therefore are not suitable

for human consumption.

The instant appeal seeks to set aside an order of the Magistrate dated

02.10.2012 and order of the High Court dated 17.12.2014 (which affirmed

the former) whereby a preliminary objection raised by the appellants was

dismissed. The said objection pertained to the maintainability of the case

where it was argued that since the alleged offence was committed by a

body corporate, the body corporate and its directors ought to be named as

CA-PHC-194-14 Page 4 of 12 02/06/2022 IJ-26-22

accused as per Section 27 of the Act. Thus, the instant appeal pivots on

the issue of whether the appellants fall within the ambit of Section 27 of

the Act.

Prior to dealing with the question of law, this Court will set out the factual

background. The appellants were arrested by the respondent on

22.05.2010 and produced before the Magistrate Court of Mannar, based

on a Report field under Section 136(1)b of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No. 15 of 1979 (hereinafter the CPC). It was alleged that the appellants

have committed an offence under the Act as employees of Manthai Salt

Ltd. Hence appellants have been accused of committing an offence

punishable under Section 18(1)(a) of the Act for contravening Section

2(1)(a), (b) of the Act read with Regulation No. 4, 5(a), (b), (c), (d) of the Food

(Iodization Salt) Regulations 2005 made by gazette extraordinary No.

1405/3 dated 11.08.2005. The appellants were produced before the

Magistrate Court of Mannar under Case No. B 469/09. They were

remanded till 07.06.2010 and were enlarged on surety bail of Rs.

100,000/- subsequently. On 15.06.2010, counsel for the appellants raised

an objection in terms of Section 27 of the Act contending that the alleged

offence has been committed by a body corporate within the meaning of the

Act and that action should be instituted against Manthai Salt Ltd, which

is a duly incorporated company under the Companies Act. In this regard,

the Magistrate sought the opinion of the Attorney General. By letter dated

24.06.2011, the Attorney General advised the Magistrate to proceed

against the appellants under Section 18 of the Act. After considering such

an opinion, the Magistrate rejected the objection raised by the counsel for

the appellants and ordered them to proceed with trial by order dated

02.10.2012. Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellants filed a

revision application, which was dismissed by the learned High Court judge

of Mannar by order dated 17.12.2014. Being aggrieved by the said order

of the High Court and the order of the Magistrate, the appellants have

preferred the instant Appeal to the Court of Appeal seeking to set aside the

CA-PHC-194-14 Page 5 of 12 02/06/2022 IJ-26-22

order of the Magistrate dated 02.10.2012 and order of the High Court

dated 17.12.2014.

The appellants are alleged to have committed an offence as per Section

18(1)(a) of the Act.

Section 18 (1) Every person who contravenes any of the

provisions of this Act or any regulations made thereunder or

fails to comply with any direction given under this Act shall be

guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction-

(a) where the nature of the offence involves injury to the

health of the public, to imprisonment for a term not

less than six months and not exceeding three years,

and also to a fine not less than five thousand rupees

and not exceeding ten thousand rupees;

The phrase every person means either a natural person or a legal person.

Section 27 elaborates on the constitution of the said person by refereeing

to a body of persons and a body corporate:

Section 27 Where an offence under this Act or any regulations

made thereunder is committed by a body of persons then:

(a) if that body of persons is a body corporate, every person

who at the time of commission of the offence was a director,

general manager, secretary or other similar officer of that

body; or

(b) if that body is not a body corporate every person who at

the time of commission of the offence was a member of that

body,

shall be deemed to be guilty of that offence, unless he proves

that the offence was committed without his consent or

concurrence, and he exercised all such diligence to prevent the

CA-PHC-194-14 Page 6 of 12 02/06/2022 IJ-26-22

commission of that offence as he ought to have exercised in

the circumstances having regard to the nature of his functions.

(Emphasis added)

Neither party dispute the fact that Manthai Ltd is a body corporate. The

only dispute is whether the appellants, namely the Regional Manager,

Production Manager and Assistant Production Manager of Manthai Salt

Ltd, can be held liable for committing an offence as per Section 18(1)(a) of

the Act.

The counsel for the appellants submitted that none of the directors of

Manthai Ltd had been named as the accused in the Magistrate Court Case

filed by the respondent. The three officers who were charged were merely

asked to appear for an inquiry where they were produced before Court on

a Saturday, remanded, and later released on bail. The counsel's contention

for the appellants is that the appellants cannot be considered within the

category of director, general manager, secretary or other similar officer

as envisaged in Section 27 of the Act. The counsel for the appellant

submitted that the very same objection as raised before the Magistrate

Court which was overruled on 02.10.2012. The counsel referred to the said

order (Vide Page 51 of the English Translation of the Brief) and submitted

that the rationale for such overruling by the Magistrate was the advice

tendered by the Attorney General, which the Magistrate himself sought.

Next, the counsel for the appellants referred to Section 60(7) of the

Consumer Affairs Authority Act, No.09 of 2003, which stipulates every

director and every officer of that body is deemed guilty of the offence

committed under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act. The counsel for the

appellant contrasted Section 69 (7) of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act

with Section 27 of the Act to state that in the former, the legislature has

intended to hold a wider group of people liable, whereas, in the latter, the

legislature has specifically limited the liability to a group of persons within

the body corporate, i.e., director, general manager, secretary or other

CA-PHC-194-14 Page 7 of 12 02/06/2022 IJ-26-22

similar officer. Reference was made to a judgment delivered by the Court

of Appeal under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act (Susantha Chaminda

Ratnayake v Consumer Affairs Authority CA/PHC/APN/ 149/2017 CA

Minute dated 18.09.2020 at page 13), which upheld the imperativeness of

naming both the body corporate and its directors when an offence has

been alleged. It was further submitted that employees of the body

corporate Manthai Salt Ltd, who do not fall within the category of people

envisioned under Section 27 of the Act cannot be made individually liable

in a context where neither the body corporate nor its directors have been

named as accused. It was the counsels contention that in the absence of

the body corporate and the directors or similar person been named as

accused, the naming of three ordinary employees is contrary to law.

The submissions of the State Counsel for the respondent stressed that the

case filed in the Magistrate Court is not a case file against a body corporate

but against three individuals who are the appellants. The State Counsel

referred to Section 18 of the Act to support this submission and stated

that the said section refers to every person who contravenes any

provisions of the act contending that by virtue of Section 18(1) of the Act

even an individual or group of individuals (as in this case) could be found

liable for offences under the Act. in the written submissions, the

respondent contends that the evidence of the case relates that the

appellants have individually and personally committed the crime despite

the fact that they were employed by Manthai Salt Ltd. The submissions

further state that this crime was committed by the appellants in

furtherance of their personal/ individual objective and not in furtherance

of the interests of the companys business. It is the respondents

contention that Section 27 of the Act does not come into play and that the

facts of the case do not amount to corporate criminality (Vide Page 7 of

written submissions of the respondent).

CA-PHC-194-14 Page 8 of 12 02/06/2022 IJ-26-22

Having briefly set out the submissions of both parties, this Court will firstly

deal with the contention of the respondent that the instant matter is not

one concerning corporate criminal liability. For this purpose, the Charge

Sheet in the Magistrate case found on Page 37 of the Brief will be referred

to. The said Charge Sheet begins as follows:

01. Kanapathippillai Arumukaswamy (Regional Manager)

02. Eliyas Anthonippillai (Production Manager)

03. Arumukasamy Kisotharan (Assistant Production Manager)

The charges have been framed against the appellants as follows,

At Manthai Salt Limited of Mannar located in salt-flat Road,

Periyakadai Mannar within the jurisdiction of this Court.

..

On page 44 of the Brief the Journal entries dated 02.06.2010 includes the

submission made by the Public Health Inspector, where he states the

following we have produced these three suspects before the Court since

these three suspects working at the Manathai Salt Corporation Limited are

the ones who directly got involved in producing salt and selling out the same

which is harmful to the human consumption and since these three are the

only responsible officers (Vide Page 44 of the Brief). After such

submission, the Magistrate orders to detain the suspects in remand until

07.06.2010. It is patently clear that the charges have been framed against

the appellants in their official capacity as employees of Manthai Salt Ltd.

Therefore, this Court rejects the respondent's contention that the accused

have been charged in their personal capacity for committing an offence

under the Act. The appellants have been charged in their official capacity

as employees of Manthai Salt Ltd, which is a body corporate with perpetual

succession and a common seal having a legal persona which could sue or

be sued.

CA-PHC-194-14 Page 9 of 12 02/06/2022 IJ-26-22

This Court would like to pause at this juncture and refer to the words of

His Lordship Justice Saleem Marsoof in Central Bank of Sri Lanka and

Others v Lankem Tea and Rubber Plantations (PVT) Ltd 2009 2 SLR

75. The case concerned alleged contravention of Section 10(1) read with

Section 51(1) of the Exchange Control Act No 24 of 1953, whereby a

penalty was imposed on Lankem Tea and Rubber Plantations (Pvt) Ltd by

the Controller of Exchange. Though the facts and the applicable law are

different to the instant matter, Central Bank v Lankem Pvt Ltd (supra)

refers to the nature of liability imposed upon a body corporate which has

a separate legal personality from its employees: It is trite law that the legal

personality of a corporate body such as Lankem Tea and Rubber

Plantations (Pvt) Ltd., is distinct from that of its members and directors,

and even if it be the case that none of the current members of that

Company was Directors or even shareholders of Lankem Tea and Rubber

Plantations (Pvt) Ltd, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence,

that will not affect its liability under Section 51(1) of the Exchange Control

Act.

Having determined that the appellants have been charged in their

professional capacity as employees of the body corporate Manthai Salt Ltd,

this Court will now evaluate whether the appellants fall within the ambit

of Section 27(a) of the Act. Section 27 (a) stipulates Where an offence

under this Act or any regulations made thereunder is committed by a body

of persons then: (a) if that body of persons is a body corporate, every person

who at the time of commission of the offence was a director, general

manager, secretary or other similar officer of that body; or. The wording of

the Section indicates a class or a genus of people whereby the legislature

has limited the liability of an offence under the Act to a director, general

manager, secretary or other similar officer. As none of the appellants is a

director, general manager or a secretary, the question to be dealt with is

whether they fall within the ambit of similar officer. To that end, it is the

considered view of this Court that the words similar officer should be

CA-PHC-194-14 Page 10 of 12 02/06/2022 IJ-26-22

read ejusdem generis to mean similar in nature to the class of persons who

exert authority, make binding decisions and exert control over the

business of the body corporate as a director, general manager or

secretary.

The doctrine of ejusdem generis is applied when some specified words are

followed by the general words. As such, the words director, general

manager and secretary are specific words, and the words similar officer

is general. As there is ambiguity as to whether the appellants, namely the

Regional Manager, Production Manager and Assistant Production Manager

of Manthai Salt Ltd, would fall within the meaning of similar officer, this

Court will utilize the doctrine of ejusdem generis to achieve the purpose

or objective of the Act. This doctrine provides that the general words which

follow the specified words will be restricted to the same class of the

specified words. As held in Viscount Simonds in Attorney General v.

Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover, (1957) AC 436 at 461 of the report,

when general words are juxtaposed with specific words, general words

cannot be read in isolation. Their color and their contents are to be derived

from their context. (Also see- Evans v. Cross -(1938) 1 KB 694)

Hence, it is incumbent on this Court to ascertain whether the Regional

Manager, Production Manager and Assistant Production Manager could be

placed within the similar class as a director, general manager and

secretary.

When the legislature stipulated specific words of director, general

manager, secretary, it is clear that their intention was to restrict the

imposition of liability to those within the body corporate who has the

authority and control to make high-level decisions regarding the business

carried out and who amply represent the entire body corporate. This

excludes ordinary employees of the body corporate. Had the legislature

intended all employees of the body corporate to be held liable in the event

an offence has been committed under the Act, the legislature would have

CA-PHC-194-14 Page 11 of 12 02/06/2022 IJ-26-22

resorted to a language a such as all officers as opposed to specifying the

director, general manager, or the secretary followed by the words similar

officers. The reason for the legislature to utilize a general term such as

similar officers is an indication that the class of persons intended by the

legislature cannot be exhaustively enumerated, i.e., there may be

instances where officers who carry the same obligations and duties of a

director, general manager or secretary are identified by some other name

such as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer & etc. Therefore,

it is evident that the legislature intended the generality of the section to be

restricted by the use of specific enumerations.

The words director and general manager signify persons who have

authority and general oversight over the entire business of a company or

a corporation. In a structural hierarchy of a company, these persons would

constitute the topmost level of decision-makers exerting control over the

entirety of the company. When considering the Companies Act No 7 of

2007, the scheme of the law gives special recognition to the persons

holding the office of director and secretary. As the law stands today,

directors are entrusted with statutorily recognised duties (Section 187

189) while carrying liabilities even to the extent of personal criminal

liability if they act negligently or in breach of their duties. (Section 220(4)).

A secretary has authority and oversight in respect of records of the entire

company and is endowed with statutory responsibilities. Therefore, it is

evident that the class of persons under which a director, general manager

or secretary has duties and responsibilities to the entirety of the company

where they exert authority on behalf of the company. It is illogical to

categorize a Regional Manager, a Production Manager and an Assistant

Production Manager in the same class as there is no evidence of the effect

of their authority or oversight over the entirety of Manthai Salt Ltd. This

is, even so, when none of the directors of the Manthai Salt Ltd has been

named as accused in the Magistrate Court when the Act clearly refers to

CA-PHC-194-14 Page 12 of 12 02/06/2022 IJ-26-22

them as being liable in the event the body corporate is accused of

committing an offence.

Based on the above reasoning, this Court agrees with the contention of the

appellants that the appellants do not fall within the ambit of Section 27 of

the Act. Hence, this Court upholds the preliminary objection raised by the

appellants in Magistrate Court Case No 25646 and sets aside the order of

the Magistrate dated 02.10.2012, and the order of the High Court dated

17.12.2014.

Appeal allowed.
