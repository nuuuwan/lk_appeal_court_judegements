JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General under Sections 54(A) (b)

and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for the Trafficking and Possession of 385.2

grams of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) on 08th February 2012 in the High

Court of Puttalam.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both

counts and the learned High Court Judge of Puttalam has imposed a

sentence of life imprisonment for both counts on 21st of June, 2017.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent for this matter to be argued in his absence due

to the Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument he was connected via

Zoom platform from prison.

3 | P a g e

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised:

1. The prosecution has solely relied on the evidence given by PW1 as it

failed to call other witnesses who had participated in the raid.

2. PW1 had not disclosed the best evidence to the court even though he

had the information.

3. There are contradictions on the evidence given by PW1.

4. Judgment is not in conformity with Section 283 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

Back ground of the case

On 07/02/2012 PW1 IP/Hiriyadeniya attached to the Police Narcotic

Bureau had received information from ASP/SriLal also attached to the

Police Narcotic Bureau about the trafficking of Heroin in the Kalpitiya area.

Originally the information was received by SI/Abeysinghe attached to the

Special Bureau of Kalpitiya Police Station. The PW1 had left for the raid

along with 08 other police officers attached to the Police Narcotic Bureau

after completing all necessary formalities. The team had left the Bureau

around 17:00 hours. First the team had gone to the Katunayake Police

Station to accompany ASP/Srilal. The ASP had travelled in his car along

with PW1 and PC 50142. Meanwhile IP/ Bogamuwa with other police

officers travelled in a van belonging to the Police Narcotic Bureau.

First the team had gone to the Kalpitiya Buddhist Temple where they had

met SI/Abeysinghe with his informant. Through him they had spoken to

the informant Sadha regarding the purchase of heroin without revealing

their identity as police officers. Thereafter Sadha had come to meet the

police team. After convincing, Sadha had agreed to assist the police in the

raid. As the informant Sadha told PW1 that the trafficker only sells drugs

during the early hours on the following day, it was decided that the witness

and their team would return the following day to make a deal. But the team

had decided to remain there until the culprits were apprehended. PW1,

4 | P a g e

ASP, the informant Sadha and PC 50124 had remained in the car while

other members remained in the police van. After some time, Sadha had left

the vehicle. At 3.30 a.m. on 08/02/2012 the group of police officers had

moved towards Kalpitiya and stopped near a circuit bungalow belonging to

the Coast Conservation Department. The informant Sadha after speaking to

a person over the phone, had remained with them until the execution of the

raid. As the battery of the phone used by Sadha had run out, PW1 had

given his phone to Sadha to continue the deal. They had to wait about

nearly five hours to complete their mission. As Sadha was not aware that

PW1 and his team were police officers, PW1 had discreetly disclosed their

identity to Sadha. After persuasion, Sadha had agreed to help them to

apprehend the Appellant.

After contacting the other team, PW1 and another had proceeded to

Mohaththuwaram for the final raid. At about 1.00 p.m. the Appellant was

arrested at Mohaththuwaram with the contraband. Upon a field check, the

contraband carried by the Appellant had reacted for Heroin

(Diacetylmorphine).

The production was in the custody of PW1 until it reached the Police

Narcotic Bureau. Upon interrogation, the Appellant had revealed that the

contraband seized from him belongs to a person called Delington Leema

from Kalpitiya. PW1 and his team thereafter had gone to arrest the said

Leema who was said to be a three-wheeler driver. He was arrested along

with his three-wheeler. Thereafter, all had proceeded to the Police Narcotic

Bureau and reached there around 12.00 midnight. Productions had been

sealed thereafter and the process had taken up until 2.00 a.m. on

09/02/2012. As such the sealed productions which had been marked as

PR 46-47/2012 were kept in PW1s custody until it was handed over to

IP/Rajakaruna on 10/02/2012 at 17:30 hours.

The person known as Delington Leema had been properly interrogated by

the Police Narcotic Bureau before his release from this case.

5 | P a g e

Following the evidence of PW2, IP/Bogamuwa, PW4, IP/Rajakaruna and

PW5 Government Analyst the prosecution had closed case.

Defence was called and the Appellant had made a dock statement and

denied the charges.

In all criminal cases, the burden is on the prosecution to produce sufficient

evidence of each element of the alleged offense at trial. To prove beyond a

reasonable doubt that the accused committed the alleged drug offence, the

prosecution must have strong evidence. The accused has the right to

present his own evidence and rebut the prosecutions evidence, but is not

required to do either to avoid a conviction.

The Judge, or the members of the jury if there is one, cannot find the

person guilty if they have a reasonable doubt about the accused persons

guilt. To convict, the Judge or the jury must believe that the only sensible

explanation, considering all the evidence, is that the accused person

committed the crime. After considering all the evidence presented before

the court, If the judge or the members of the jury are unsure whether the

accused actually committed the offence, the benefit of the doubt be

awarded to the accused.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 decided

on 24/05/1995 held that:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the

good analysis for examination has to be proved beyond reasonable

doubt.

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant argues that the prosecution has

solely relied on the evidence given by PW1 as it failed to call other

witnesses who had participated in the raid.

6 | P a g e

According to Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance, No particular number

of witnesses shall in any case be required for the proof of any fact.

This section of the Evidence Ordinance clearly lays down that no particular

number of witnesses are required to prove or disprove the facts of the case.

This section applies to both civil and criminal cases. This section is based

on the popular maxim that evidence is to be weighed and not counted.

There is no rule of law that the unsubstantiated testimony cannot be

accepted. The rule is of prudence and whether it is to be adopted or not

depends on the circumstances of each case. When the Courts are

ascertaining the truth, the number of witnesses is not considered, but the

quality of the evidence is taken into serious consideration.

In this case PW1 had organised the raid after receiving the information

from a police officer attached to the Special Investigation Bureau of

Kalpitiya Police Station. Initially, the group of police officers travelled in a

van up to Katunayake and the team split into two thereafter. PW1 had

travelled in the official car of ASP/Srilal from Katunayake and PW2

IP/Bogamuwa took charge of the remaining group in the van. Hence, two

vehicles had been used to conduct the raid in the present case.

Firstly, PW1 had met the informant who had given information to the

officer at Kalpitiya Police Station. Through him they were introduced to the

second informer Sadha and the raid was conducted upon the information

provided by Sadha. Following the information provided by Sadha PW1 had

decided to proceed to Mohaththuwaram in the car. Hence, the police party

under the command of PW2 was stationed near the bungalow of the Coast

Conservation Department Circuit. After a successful raid all of them had

met near the Coast Conservation Department Circuit Bungalow again and

PW2 had assisted PW1 to conduct further investigations.

After the conclusion of the evidence of PW1, the prosecution had led the

evidence of PW2.

7 | P a g e

Calling witnesses in a trial is the entire prerogative of the prosecution.

In AG v. Mohamed Saheeb Mohamed Ismath CA/87/1997 decided on

13/07/1999 Jayasuriya J. stated that:

There is no requirement in law that evidence of a Police Officer who

has conducted an investigation into a charge of illegal possession of

heroin, should be corroborated in regard to material particulars

emanating from an independent source..

In King v. Chalo Singho 42 NLR 269 the Court held that:

It must, therefore, be regarded well-established now, that a

prosecutor is not bound to call all the witnesses on the indictment, or to

render them for cross-examination. That is a matter in his discretion,

but in exceptional circumstances, a judge might interfere to ask him to

call a witness, or to call witness as a witness of the court.

In The Attorney General v. Devunderage Nihal decided on 12/05/2011

R. K. S. Suresh Chandra, J stated that:

Therefore, it is quite clear that unlike in the case where an accomplice

or a decoy is concerned in any case there is no requirement in law

that the evidence of a Police Officer who conducted an investigation or

raid resulting in the arrest of an offender need to be corroborated in

material particulars. However, caution must be exercised by a trial

Judge in evaluating such evidence and arriving at a conclusion against

an offender. It cannot be stated as a rule of thumb that the evidence of

a police witness in a drug related offence must be corroborated in

material particulars where police officers are the key witnesses. If

such a proposition were to be accepted it would impose an added

burden on the prosecution to call more than one witness on the back

on the indictment to prove its case in a drug related offence however

satisfactory the evidence of the main police witness would be.

8 | P a g e

In The Attorney General v. Devunderage Nihal decided on 03/01/2019

Aluwihare, PC J., held that:

a) An accused can be convicted on a single witness in a

prosecution based on a police detection, if the judge forms the

view that the evidence of such witness can, with caution, be

relied upon, after probing the testimony.

In this instant appeal, the prosecution had led the evidence of PW1 and

PW2 to show how the police team prepared, gathered necessary

information, acted on that information and arrested the Appellant with

Heroin on 08/02/2012 at Mohaththuwaram, Kalpitiya. The learned High

Court Judge had accurately analysed the evidence presented by both

parties to arrive to his conclusion. Hence, it is incorrect to say that the

learned High Court Judge had only relied upon the evidence of PW1 to

come to his conclusion. Therefore, this ground of appeal has no merit.

The second ground of appeal is that PW1 had not disclosed the best

evidence to the court even though he had the information.

Following the best evidence rule is very important in criminal trials, as the

criminal justice system considers that an accused to be innocent until

proven guilty and the guilt of the accused has to be proved beyond

reasonable doubt and not on a mere prevalence of probabilities, thus

imposing upon the prosecution the obligation to adduce the best possible

evidence to prove the guilt of the accused.

Therefore, in proving the guilt of an accused, the investigating officers are

duty bound to collect the best possible evidence and the public prosecutor

is bound to present the best possible evidence to prove an alleged fact or

circumstance leading to the commission of the offence. A failure to lead the

best evidence thus makes the prosecution vulnerable to an adverse

9 | P a g e

inference being drawn against it, as such failure amounts to suppression of

the best evidence.

Under this ground the Counsel for the Appellant argues that the

prosecution had withheld the evidence of the informant Sadha in breach of

the best evidence rule. He further argues that the failure to call Sadha

creates a serious doubt on the prosecution case and also give rise to the

presumption under Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance.

Section 125 of the Evidence Ordinance reads:

No Magistrate or Police Officer shall be compelled to say

whence he got the information as to the commission of any

offence, and no revenue officer shall be compelled to say

whence he got any information as to the commission of any

offence against the public revenue or the excise laws.

E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy refers to the case of Weston v. Peary Mohan

Dass [1912] 40 Cal.898 at 920 in his much-acclaimed academic work by

the name of The Law of Evidence Volume II (Book 2) as mentioned

below:

Section 125 is based on the principle that the public interest in

the detection and combating of crime demands that those

persons who are the channel by means of which the detection is

made, should not be unnecessarily disclosed. If objection is

taken under this section, it cannot be made the ground of

adverse inferences against the witnesses.

Maintaining the confidentiality of an informants identity is a well-

recognized fact of great importance in the resolution of crimes pertaining to

drugs. The police remain to gain information and leads from these

informants that they may not be able to obtain from other sources. If police

reveal the identity of an informant, they may not be able to obtain any

further information from that person, and others may be afraid to serve as

10 | P a g e

informants due to the risk involved which often includes threats to life. In

cases of this nature, preserving the identity of an informant is of utmost

important for his safety as well as the best option for successful future

investigations. PW1 in his evidence clearly explained to the court how such

information is important in the detection of the trafficking of drugs.

(Page 160 of the brief.)

Hence, not calling informant Sadha to give evidence on behalf of the

prosecution has not caused any prejudice to the Appellant as PW1 had

vividly explained to court how the raid was conducted with the information

they had received from Sadha. Hence, this ground of appeal is also sans

any merit.

In the third ground of appeal the Counsel for the Appellant contends that

there are contradictions on the evidence given by PW1.

In his dock statement the Appellant took up the position that the Heroin

detected did not belong to him. While he was waiting to obtain money from

a person called Delington Leema he had been surreptitiously implicated in

this case.

According to PW1, Delington Leema was arrested along with his three-

wheeler and taken to the Police Narcotic Bureau where the officers had

conducted a fair investigation and Delington Leema had been released

upon the confirmation of his innocence.

The Counsel for the Appellant advanced an argument that PW1 had kept

the production in his personal locker for a considerable period of time

11 | P a g e

before it was handed over to PW4 and therefore, this raises a serious doubt

over the productions of the case.

According to PW1, after a successful raid they had reached the Police

Narcotic Bureau and the productions had been properly sealed in the

presence of the Appellant. The sealing process had gone up till 2.00 a.m. on

09/02/2012. Thereafter the said productions were kept in his personal

locker and the same was handed over to PW4/IP Rajakaruna on

10/02/2012 at 5.30 p.m. In his evidence he had very clearly explained to

court the circumstances and the reasons as to why he had kept the

productions under his personal locker till it was handed over to

IP/Rajakaruna. The evidence given by PW1 on this point is re-produced

below:

(Pages166-168 of the brief.)

The evidence given by PW1 is clear and cogent and the defence could not

mark a single contradiction upon his evidence. Furthermore, he was

subjected to a lengthy cross examination. PW1 had vividly explained how

this raid was initiated and concluded successfully. As the evidence given by

PW1 was not tainted with contradictions, omissions and ambiguity, the

Learned Trial Judge had accurately accepted the evidence of PW1 as

credible. Hence, this ground of appeal also fails on its own merit.

In the final ground of appeal, the counsel for the Appellant contends that

the judgment is not in conformity with Section 283 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

Upon perusal of the Judgment, the learned High Court Judge had

discussed all the evidence presented before him in his judgment. He had

properly analysed and arrived at a correct finding. The judgment is in

conformity with Section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of

1979. In this case the learned High Court Judge had the priceless

advantage of observing the demeanour and the deportment of the witnesses

led before him. Hence, this ground of appeal is also devoid of merit.

I have scrutinised the evidence and the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge and I am satisfied that the Appellant has been rightly convicted of

the offence that was levelled against him.

14 | P a g e

Due to the aforesaid reasons, I am not inclined to interfere with the

judgment of the Learned High Court Judge dated 21/06/2017. Hence, I

dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed on

the Appellant.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Puttalam along with the original case record.
