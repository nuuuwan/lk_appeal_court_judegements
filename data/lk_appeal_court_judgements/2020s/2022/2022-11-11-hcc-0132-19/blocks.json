The rejection of evidence of the accused is wrongful, and the learned Judge of the High Court has failed to correctly apply the principles governing the evaluation of a dock statement. 3. Brief facts of the case. As per the evidence of the prosecution, the deceased is the father-in-law of the appellant. At the time of the incident, a divorce case that was filed by the daughter of the deceased against her husband, the appellant, was pending before Court. The wife of the appellant had been living with her parents. On the day of the incident, the deceased, the wife of the deceased (PW1), and their grandchild (PW3) who is the daughter of the accused have been watching TV in the night. The PW1 has heard someone calling . Then the deceased has opened the door. As the deceased opened the door, the appellant has barged inside the house and has assaulted the deceased on the head with a sword. The PW1 has screamed pleading the accused not to kill her husband. Then a neighbor by the name of Norman (PW2) has come and helped the deceased, at which time the sword that was held by the appellant has fallen. Thereafter, the deceased was taken to the Nagoda hospital. From there, he was transferred to the Colombo general hospital where he succumbed to his injuries. 4. In his unsworn statement from the dock, the appellant has stated that, on the day of the incident he has gone to visit his children. His father-in-law (the deceased) has scolded him asking him not to come over to their house hereafter. Then, the deceased has hit him on his head with a sword. He was bleeding from his head. When he started running he has felt dizzy. Thereafter, his mother and his sister have taken him to the hospital.",

This witness has stated that, although the appellants mother told him that the appellant was injured, he didnt see any injury on the appellant. Two days after the incident, the appellant has surrendered to the police. The police officers have also not observed any injury on the appellant. There is no medico-legal report or any other evidence submitted at the trial with regard to any injury caused to the appellant.
