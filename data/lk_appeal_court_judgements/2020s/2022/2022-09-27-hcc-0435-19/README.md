WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The accused-appellant was indicted before the High Court of

Kuliyapitiya on two counts of having committed grave sexual abuse on

or about 08th August 2011, offences punishable under section

365(b)(2)(b) of the Penal Code. He was convicted of both charges and

sentenced after the trial.

This appeal is preferred against the said convictions and sentences.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of both

parties. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the

appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent

made oral submissions.

Briefly, the facts relating to the case are as follows:

The victim was an 8-year-old girl at the time of the incident. The

appellant was about 63 years old at the time. The victim was living

with her mother, and the appellant was a known neighbour of the

victim who ran a boutique close to the victim's house, which was

nearly 50 meters away.

According to the prosecution, the victim went to the boutique on the

day of the incident, 12.08.2011, to purchase an ice packet. The

Appellant had given her some peanuts and asked her to come to the

kitchen while no one else was present. Thereafter, the appellant had

shown his penis to the victim, raised her skirt, lowered her

underwear, and pressed the penis against her vagina. The appellant

had touched her breasts and her vaginal area with his fingers. The

appellant then squeezed the victim's vaginal area, inflicting pain on

her. The appellant had warned her not to cry and had threatened to

kill her father and mother. He had also told the victim not to tell this

to her parents. The victim had seen blood in her vaginal area after

going home. She had told her mother about the incident after three

days of the incident. Thereafter, the mother of the victim made a

complaint to the police on 12.08.2011.

The accused-appellant gave evidence in this case and called a witness

on his behalf. The appellant's position was that the victim's mother

fabricated this story because of an animosity she had with the

appellant over a boundary fence dispute.

Although, five grounds of appeal have been stated in the written

submissions tendered on behalf of the appellant, the learned counsel

4

for the appellant confined his arguments to two grounds at the

hearing of the appeal. The first ground was that the evidence of the

victim regarding the first count has not been corroborated by the

medical evidence. The second ground was that there is no evidence to

prove the second count. While advancing the said two grounds, the

learned counsel took up the position that the victims evidence is false

and that this is a fabricated story.

In reply, the learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that no

mother would make up a false story that her little daughter was

sexually abused. Furthermore, the learned Deputy Solicitor General

contended that there could not be a boundary dispute as stated by the

appellant, because police investigations revealed that there was a land

and a house between the appellant's land and the victim's land.

Therefore, the learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the

defence taken up by the appellant necessarily fails.

Before dealing with the said two grounds of appeal, I wish to mention

at this stage that although it was not taken up at the hearing, the

learned counsel for the appellant has stated in his written submission

that the case for the prosecution entirely depended on circumstantial

evidence. I regret that I am unable to agree with that argument

because this is not a case entirely based upon circumstantial

evidence. The victim (PW-1) described the appellant's acts of grave

sexual abuse against her. This is direct evidence regarding the

offences and not circumstantial evidence. So, there is no issue with

evaluating circumstantial evidence.

Now, I proceed to deal with the first ground of appeal. The appellant

had been charged with two offences of grave sexual abuse. The

5

learned counsel for the appellant pointed out that PW1 stated in her

testimony about sexual penetration by answering as follows;

: ?

: .

(Page 70 of the appeal brief)

However, it is my view that the said answer does not imply sexual

intercourse or sexual penetration because she has stated that the

appellant pressed his penis inside but has never stated that it went

inside the vagina. When PW 6, the Judicial Medical Officer gave

evidence, he clearly stated that there could be no injuries when this

kind of sexual abuse is committed. The doctor specifically stated that

causing the acts of grave sexual abuse could not be excluded for the

reason of not having injuries. Therefore, the absence of corroborative

medical evidence is not a reason to fail the charges of grave sexual

abuse.

Although on certain occasions, it has been held in our Courts that the

victims evidence in respect of sexual offences has to be corroborated

by other evidence, sexual offences could be proved on the

uncorroborated evidence of the victim, if the court is convinced that

the victim is speaking the truth as decided in the cases of The King V.

Themis Singho - 45 NLR 378 and Premasiri and another V. The Queen

- 77 NLR 85. Also, it was held in Regina V. W.G Dharmasena - 58 NLR

15 that in a charge of rape, it is not in law necessary that the evidence

of the prosecutrix should be corroborated.

In the case at hand, there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of

PW-1. It was pointed out during the cross-examination of PW1 that

she stated different times to the Police and in Court, in respect of the

time she went to the appellants boutique. Other than that, no single

6

contradiction was marked or omission was brought to the notice of the

court in cross-examination. The victim was an 8-year-old small child

when she faced this unfortunate incident. She gave evidence regarding

the incident after 6 years of the incident. Even then, no single

contradiction could be marked or omission could be brought to the

notice. Also, there was no issue regarding the probability of her story.

Hence, there was no reason whatsoever to disbelieve her evidence. Her

evidence could be acted upon without corroboration.

The second ground urged by the learned counsel for the appellant was

that there was no evidence to prove the second charge. The PW-1 has

clearly stated that the appellant has touched her vaginal area with his

fingers and also squeezed the vaginal area. (Pages 71 and 72 of the

appeal brief) In addition, she stated that she was having pain in the

vaginal area. Therefore, the ingredients of the second count have been

clearly established. Hence, there is no merit on the second ground of

appeal as well.

This court has also considered the delay in making a complaint to the

police. The incident took place on 08.08.2011 and the complaint was

made on 12.08.2011. According to PW-2, the mother, PW-1,

had informed her about the incident on 11.08.2011 morning. The

PW2 stated that she went to take medicine from an ayurvedic doctor

on that day, came back in the evening, and there was no time to go to

the police station. The very next day, a complaint was made to the

police. So, there was no delay in making the complaint to the police

after the mother was informed about the incident. PW2, the mother,

explained why a complaint could not be made on the 11th of August.

The short delay occurred because the victim child told this incident to

her mother after three days.

In the case of Thimbirigolle Sirirathana Thero V. OIC, Police Station,

Rasnayakepura CA No. 194/2015, decided on 07.05.2019, it was

held that when a child is sexually assaulted by an adult, it is also

natural for the victims family to think twice before making a

complaint to the police. There can be adverse effects on the child

when this kind of offence is exposed. Also, it was held that in cases

of sexual offences, Courts have found that victims of sexual offences

can react in different ways. Some may complain immediately. Others

may feel for example afraid, shocked, ashamed, confused, or even

guilty and may not speak out until some time has passed. There is no

typical reaction. (Crown Court compendium part 1, May 2016) So,

when considering the behavior of a child victim of this nature, as

explained in the aforementioned case, the four-day delay in making a

complaint with the police does not cast reasonable doubt on the

prosecution case.

The only other matter to be considered is that PW-1 has not stated

about pressing the appellants penis against her vagina when giving

the short history to the doctor who examined her. As pointed out by

the learned Deputy Solicitor General, after two days of admitting to

the hospital, she was examined by the doctor. One cannot expect an

8-year-old small girl to recount every detail of the incident all of the

time. Before being examined by the doctor, she made a statement to

the police as well. However, in cross-examining the PW1, no single

contradiction with the police statement was marked or no single

omission was brought to the notice of the court. It indicates that she

has stated all important details of the incident to the police. If she had

fabricated a false story, she could have told the doctor also everything

that she stated to the police. Hence, the aforesaid minor omission in

the short history given by her has no impact on the credibility of

PW1s evidence.

8

On the other hand, when the PW1 stated that she was sexually

abused when she went to the appellants boutique, at least, the

appellant has not stated in his evidence whether he accepts the fact

that PW1 came to his boutique on the day in question. The appellant

neither admits nor denies that she came to his boutique. He simply

claims that this story was fabricated because of her mother's

animosity towards him due to a boundary dispute. Although the

appellant said so in his evidence, this main defence was not even

suggested to the PW1 on behalf of the appellant, when she was cross-

examined. Therefore, his version is uncertain. So, the uncertain

defence version which was not even suggested to the victim would not

cast any doubt on the prosecution case.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the learned High Court Judges

decision to convict the appellant on both counts is correct.

However, there is a defect in passing the sentence. The 10 years of

rigorous imprisonment for each count, the fine, compensation, and

default sentences imposed by the learned High Court Judge are

perfectly correct. However, the learned Judge has imposed a condition

that 10 years of imprisonment imposed on each count should run

concurrently if the compensation is paid. The said condition implies

that the 10 years of imprisonment imposed on two counts should run

consecutively if the compensation is not paid. Imposing such a

condition is not in compliance with the legal provisions governing

sentencing. Therefore, I set aside the said condition and direct 10

years of rigorous imprisonment for counts one and two to run

concurrently. The rest of the sentence namely, the fine, compensation,

and default sentences remain unchanged.

Subject to the above variation in respect of the sentence, the appeal is

dismissed.

I agree.
