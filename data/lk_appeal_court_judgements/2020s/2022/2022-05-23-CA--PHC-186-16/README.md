This is an appeal filed on 11.11.2016 against the High Court order dated

01.11.2016 in case No. HCRA/38/2015. By the said impugned order, the High

Court directed a retrial in Magistrate Court Case No 49502, which was concluded

on 30.12.2014, whereby the accused-respondent-appellants (hereinafter the

appellant) were acquitted. Two of the three accused in Case No. 49502 are now

CA-PHC-186-16 Page 4 of 8 25/05/2022 IJ-20-22

deceased, and the instant appeal is sustained by the remaining accused, who has

invoked the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to set aside the impugned High

Court order.

The appellant was charged in the Magistrate Court for causing mischief under

Section 410 of the Penal Code. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned

Magistrate acquitted the appellant on 30.12.2014. On 31.03.2015, the Magistrate

directed the virtual complainant (hereinafter the respondent) to pay compensation

of Rs. 10,000/- to each of the accused. This order was made under Section 17 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.15 of 1979 (hereinafter the CPC) whereby

the Magistrate Court found the respondent to be guilty of making a frivolous and

vexatious complaint against the appellant. Aggrieved by such an order, the

respondent filed a revision application to the High Court to canvass the order of

compensation. It is pertinent to note that the said revision application did not

canvass the appellants acquittal by order dated 30.12.2014. During the support

stage of the said revision application, the appellant raised an objection based on

the maintainability of the action. Thereafter, both parties made submissions on

this jurisdictional issue, and the High Court reserved the order on the same point.

Nevertheless, on 01.11.2016, the learned High Court judge delivered a final order

directing a retrial. Hence, the appellant has come before this Court on the

following grounds:

i. The petitioner in the High Court did not challenge the acquittal order dated

30.12.2014, but only the order dated 31.03.2015 regarding compensation,

yet the High Court ordered a re-trial.

ii. The learned High Court failed to appreciate that Hon. Attorney General

has not filed an appeal against the acquittal in the Magistrate Court

iii. The learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate that parties only made

submissions with regard to jurisdiction, but not about merits of the

revision

iv. The learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate that the order dated

2016/11/1 should have been only on whether the petitioner has rights to

file a revision or not.

CA-PHC-186-16 Page 5 of 8 25/05/2022 IJ-20-22

At the outset it is pertinent to highlight the nature of the revisionary jurisdiction

exercised by the High Court which is concurrent to that of the Court of Appeal.

(Ramalingam v Parameswary and Others (2000) 2 SLR 33). As such, the

revisionary jurisdiction vested on the High Court is wide enough to allow relief

that the Court deems fit. However, such an inherent power must be utilised only

in the appropriate case. If the fact of the case shocks the conscience of the Court,

an appropriate order must be delivered in furtherance of the administration of

justice.

During the argument stage, the counsel for the appellant submitted that the High

Court had made a premature order. It was contended that the submissions of

parties before the High Court were on a preliminary matter pertaining to the

maintainability of the revision application of the respondent. Hence, the parties

limited their submissions to the jurisdictional matter. The counsel for the

appellant argued that instead of delivering an order on the maintainability of the

revision application, the learned High Court judge had ordered a retrial by way

of a final order. In the written submissions, the appellant contended that the

High Court did not explicitly set aside the Magistrate Court judgment or the order

dated 31.3.2015 but ordered a retrial, which was not prayed for by the

respondent. The appellant cited King v Fernando 48 NLR 249, Queen v

Jayasinghe 69 NLR 314 to support the contention that order of retrial is

warranted under exceptional circumstances considering the time taken for the

case since the alleged offence.

The respondents counsel primarily focused on how the trial progressed in the

Magistrate Court. As such, the counsel for the respondent contended that the

Magistrate had prejudiced the respondent by considering extraneous material

that violates evidentiary principles. As such, the respondent contended that the

Magistrate had entertained statements by third parties who were not named as

witnesses to the trial, which were later used to incriminate the respondent

unjustly. It was also submitted that the Magistrate has acted outside the ambit

of his jurisdiction and determined the respondent to be of unsound mind and

then imposed a fine for the respondents deeds.

CA-PHC-186-16 Page 6 of 8 25/05/2022 IJ-20-22

The State Counsel appearing on behalf of the Attorney General agreed with the

submissions of the respondent, stating that the process adopted by the

Magistrate in concluding the trial was highly irregular. Nevertheless, the State

Counsel conceded that the revision application filed by the respondent in the

High Court did not challenge the acquittal of the appellant in the Magistrate

Court.

In the impugned order of the High Court, the learned judge has condemned the

actions of the Magistrate, stating that the sanity of the respondent and the

question of whether she was a public nuisance to the community was a matter

extraneous to the charge of mischief levelled against the appellant. The learned

High Court Judge sympathised with the respondent and observed that the

Magistrate ought to have directed the respondent to be dealt with under civil law

without finding her guilty under Section 17 of CPC. The learned High Court Judge

has ordered to conduct disciplinary action against the police officers for not

conducting a proper investigation into the respondents complaint.

In entertaining the instant application, the Court of Appeal will exercise its

appellate jurisdiction only for the purpose of correcting all errors in fact or in law

where the Court deems that the impugned order has prejudiced the substantial

rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

Here is a case where the High Court has ordered a retrial. In doing so, the learned

High Court Judge has failed to set aside the acquittal of the appellant dated

30.12.2014. Hence, the determination before this Court pivots on the issue of

whether such a retrial is warranted given the circumstances of the case. This

Court is precluded from examining matters of fact that were not challenged before

the learned High Court judge.

The offence was committed on 14.11.2009 and the trial in the Magistrate Court

was concluded on 30.12.2014. Two of the accused in the case have already

passed away, and it has been more than half a decade since the closure of the

Magistrate Courts trial. Moreover, the case pertained to a charge of mischief

whereby the respondent has alleged the appellant had damaged 12 roof tiles

belonging to the respondent by hurling rocks at the roof of the respondents

CA-PHC-186-16 Page 7 of 8 25/05/2022 IJ-20-22

house. The chances of a conviction of the remaining accused (appellant) in the

event of a fresh trial are, in this Courts opinion, remote. A retrial at this point in

time is not practical given the long delay. Ordering a retrial would require

considerable resources as well. Given the nature of the alleged offence of mischief

(which is compoundable), ordering a retrial appears to be a futile measure. In any

event, the respondent did not challenge the acquittal of the appellant in the High

Court. Instead, she canvassed the order to pay compensation.

In E. M. Gamini Edirisuriya & Others v Attorney General C.A. 228-230/2005

CA Minute dated 18.06.205, His Lordship Justice H. N. J. Perera observed the

following:

In a long line of case law authorities, our courts have consistently refused

to exercise the discretion to order a re-trial where time duration is

substantial.

In Peter Singho V. Werapitiya 55 N.L.R 157, Gratien, J. refused to consider

a retrial where time duration was over four years. In Queen V. Jayasinghe

69 N.L.R 314, Sansoni, J. refused to order re- trial where the time duration

was over three years. Shoni 19th Edition VOL V1 page 4133 states: "An

order of re-trial of a criminal case is made in exceptional cases and not

unless the Appellate Court is satisfied that the court trying the proceeding

had no jurisdiction to try it or that trial was vitiated by serious illegalities or

irregularities proceedings and on that account in substance there had been

no real trial or that the prosecutor or an accused was, for reasons over which

he had no control prevented from leading or tendering evidence material to

the charge and in the interest of justice, Appellate Court deems it appropriate

having regard to the circumstances of the case, that the accused should be

put on his trial again, an order of re-trial wipes out from the record the earlier

proceedings and exposes the person accused to another trial. In addition to

this, a re-trial should not be ordered when the court finds that it would be

superfluous for the reason that the evidence relied on by the prosecution will

never be able to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt and the like

especially when the court is of the opinion that the prosecution will be, put

CA-PHC-186-16 Page 8 of 8 25/05/2022 IJ-20-22

at an advantage by allowing them to provide the gaps or what is wanting

that resulted due to their own lapses."

Under the circumstances, it is the considered view of this Court that the instant

application is not a fit and proper case to order a retrial. For the foregoing

reasons, this Court allows the appeal and sets aside the order of the High Court

dated 01.11.2016 and the Magistrate Court order dated 31.03.2015, made under

Section 17 of the CPC.

Appeal allowed.
