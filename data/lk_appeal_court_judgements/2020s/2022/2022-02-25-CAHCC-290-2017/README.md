Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the 1st accused appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence of him by the

learned High Court Judge of Chilaw, where the appellant was sentenced to

death upon conviction.

The appellant, along with another, was indicted before the High Court of

Chilaw for committing the murder of W. Thilini Niroshani Fernando on 16th

February 2005, an offence punishable in terms of section 296 read with section

32 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, he was found guilty as charged and sentenced

accordingly, and the 2nd accused, indicted, who was the brother of the

appellant was acquitted of the charge.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant

pursued the following two grounds of appeal in his submissions before the

Court.

(1) The prosecution has failed to prove the charge beyond reasonable

doubt.

Page 3 of 14

(2) The learned trial judge has failed to consider whether the charge of

murder can be maintained.

Facts in brief: -

The appellant was the paramour of the deceaseds mother. The appellant while

living with the mother of the deceased, started an affair with her as well, and

eloped with her and commenced living together in the house where the incident

took place, while maintaining contact with the mother of deceased as well. The

deceased was a teenager and the mother never knew that it was with her

paramour, her daughter has eloped, until she came to know about her death.

The owner of the land and the house where the deceased and the appellant

who worked as a toddy tapper lived, (PW-01) has come to know about the death

of the deceased at around 5.30 in the evening of 16th February 2005.

When he visited the scene, he has seen the deceaseds body on the floor of the

house and the appellant who was crying had wanted him to take the deceased

to the hospital. He has also observed a rope hanging from the rafter of the

house and he has been informed by the appellant that the deceased hanged

herself and in order to bring her down he cut the rope.

Later, he has informed the Grama Sevaka of the area about the incident. He

has not seen any issues between the appellant and the deceased previously.

The mother of the deceased (PW-02) has stated in her evidence that it was only

after the death of her daughter, she came to know about the illicit relationship

the appellant had with her. She has observed several scratch marks when she

saw her body at the mortuary.

PW-03 was a fellow toddy tapper who worked with the appellant. On the day of

the incident, while passing the house of the appellant, he has seen the brother

of the appellant (the 2nd Accused) at the house and has also seen the deceased

standing near the front door of the house and talking to him. Later, when he

heard the news about the incident and reached the house of the appellant, he

has seen the deceased on the floor and the appellant near her crying and trying

Page 4 of 14

to revive her. He has also sought his help to take her to the hospital. However,

he has realized that she was already dead. Upon inquiry, the appellant had

informed him that the deceased hanged herself. He has also seen a part of the

noose on the floor.

PW-10 was the police officer who arrested the 2nd accused, who was the

brother of the appellant some two months after the incident upon a tip off. It

was his evidence that although the 2nd accused was notified to appear before

the police he never did. PW-10 has recovered the letter marked P-01 from his

possession. The letter which is supposed to have been written by the appellant

to his brother contains instructions to him as to what he should say to police

with regard to what happened on the day of the incident. Upon the discovery,

he has instructed PW-09 (PS 41159) to record a further statement from the

appellant at the remand prison.

PW-09, in his evidence has produced and marked the production marked P-03

which was an equipment used by toddy tappers called , recovered

based on the statement of the appellant. He has marked the relevant extract of

the statement which led to the discovery as Y under the provisions of section

27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance at the trial. It has been suggested to the

witness by the defence that the said statement was obtained by him after

threatening the appellant in front of the prison officials, which he has denied.

PW-11 was the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who has conducted the

postmortem examination (the report marked P-04) of the body of the deceased.

He has been informed that the deceased was found hanging by the appellant.

Since he had observed that the rope alleged to have been used for the hanging

has been cut, the JMO has inquired about it as he has found it important for

the postmortem.

He has been informed by the appellant that due to a quarrel he had with the

deceased, he squeezed her neck, assaulted her towards the back of the neck

using his right hand and pushed her, which resulted in her falling. It has been

his explanation to the JMO that after the incident he left the house and when

Page 5 of 14

he returned in about half an hour later, he found the deceased hanging.

Explaining further, he has stated that as the body was bent at the knees, he

was able to get hold of the body and lift it and cut the rope using his toddy

tapping knife, which resulted in her falling onto the floor and receiving injuries

to her left side of the face. He has also explained the steps he took to remove

the noose from the neck of the deceased.

The JMO was an experienced medical officer who has conducted a large

number of postmortems on suicides by hanging and murders by strangulation.

After observing the rope marks and the other marks on the neck of the

deceased, he has come to the conclusion that it was not a voluntary self-

hanging and the deceased had been strangled first and hanged thereafter. He

has well described his observations on the neck at the trial. (At page 166 of the

appeal brief)

Upon inspecting the place of the incident, he has observed that given the

maximum reach the deceased would have had because of her height, it was not

possible for her to reach the rafter that is alleged to have been used by the

deceased to hang herself without getting on to something else. He has observed

that there was nothing in the room where the body of the deceased was found

that could have been used by her to reach the rafter, if it was a voluntary

hanging as claimed.

The JMO has opined that the death was due to strangulation. And it has been

after the deceased became static a rope has been used to hang her, and the

rope marks he observed in the neck was due to the tightening of the rope

around the neck before being hanged. When question further by the learned

trial judge the JMO has well explained the reasons for his conclusions. (At

pages 169,170 and 171 of the brief)

The JMO has further clarified his opinion and has also stated that the injury

he observed on the face of the deceased was not a result of a fall, but in all

possibilities a result of an assault using a blunt object. He has opined that

such an injury can be caused using the blunt side of the production marked P-

Page 6 of 14

03 and it is possible that a person who receives a blow from such an object to

fall unconscious. He has observed 11 injuries in total on the body of the

deceased.

PW-07 and PW-08 are police officers who inspected the scene of the incident.

Both of them have been firm in their evidence that there was nothing in the

room that could have been used as an aid to reach the rafter where the

deceased supposed to have been hanged herself.

PW-04, the sister of the appellant and PW-05 the mother of the appellant has

confirmed that the letter marked P-01 was given to PW-04 by the appellant

when she visited the prison asking that it be given to the 2nd accused who was

not under arrest at the time. After receiving it from PW-04, it was the mother of

the appellant who has given it to the 2nd accused. However, they also confirm

that the appellant is a person who cannot read or write.

When called upon for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution case, both

the accused had made dock statements. The appellant has taken up the

position that the death of the deceased was a result of a suicide due to the

quarrel he had with her on the day of the incident. Interestingly, his dock

statement was in line with what is stated in the letter marked P-01.

By his judgment dated 10-10-2017 the learned High Court Judge has found

the appellant guilty on the basis that the prosecution has proved the case

beyond doubt. He has dismissed the appellants explanation as it has not

created any doubt or provided any reasonable explanation as to the case of the

prosecution.

Consideration of grounds of appeal

As pointed out correctly by the learned Presidents Counsel, since there is no

direct evidence to the hanging of the deceased, this is a matter that has to be

considered based on the circumstantial evidence and the medical evidence of

the JMO.

It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel that there was no

evidence to suggest that the appellant and the deceased had any previous

Page 7 of 14

quarrels among them, and on the day of the incident PW-03 has seen them

chatting with the brother of the appellant in front of their house. It was his

position that the appellant has admitted that he assaulted the deceased

because of the crosstalk they had due to the delay of her preparing meals for

his brother and left the house thereafter. When he returned, he found the

deceased hanging and it was he who took her down, alerted the others and

wanted her to be taken to the hospital.

The learned Presidents Counsel admitted that the letter marked P-01 was sent

by him to his brother, because he wanted to reveal what really happened and

what was stated in the letter was in line with his stand at the trial and the

dock statement. Even to the JMO the appellant has given the same explanation

when questioned by him was his stand.

The learned Presidents Counsel contended that had the learned trial judge

considered the above-mentioned proven facts, there would not be a basis to

convict the appellant for murder as it would have created a clear doubt that

this may also be a case of suicide. It was his position that since the benefit of

such a doubt has to be given to the appellant, the conviction was not safe to be

allowed to stand.

While maintaining the above position, it was also the position of the learned

Presidents Counsel that even if it is considered that the evidence against the

appellant have been established, when considered with the stand of the

appellant and the medical evidence, a conviction under section 296 cannot be

sustained.

Making his submissions based on the Concurrence Principle advanced in

Chapter 4 of the text Criminal Law of Sri Lanka by Wing-Cheong Chan,

Michael Hor, Neil Morgan, Jeeva Niriella, and Stanley Yeo, and also in

General Principles of Criminal Liability in Ceylon by Prof. G.L.Peiris at

Chapter 3, where the above principle has been discussed, it was his view that

this is a fit case where the said principle should be considered.

Page 8 of 14

However, citing the case of The King Vs. Loku Nona 11 NLR 04, he admitted

that our Courts have never recognized such a principle, although it has been

adopted by Indian Courts as relevant.

It was the contention of the learned Senior State Counsel (SSC) for the

respondent that the judgment has been pronounced on the evidence adduced

before the court. It was his position that there was circumstantial evidence

beyond reasonable doubt as to the culpability of the appellant for the murder

and the medical evidence has proven that it was a strangulation, and the

hanging had been to mislead that the deceased hanged herself.

Commenting on the suggested concurrence principle, it was the position of the

learned SSC that it is on mere speculation that submissions are being made

and not on proven facts even to consider such a situation. It was submitted

that the appellant, although was an illiterate, the evidence clearly establishes

that he was intelligent enough to attempt falsifying the facts.

Admitting that the learned High Court Judge has not given sufficient reasons

for the dismissal the dock statement of the appellant, he was of the view that

even if considered, it would not have any effect on the judgment as there was

no basis for his dock statement to create any doubt of the prosecution case nor

it was a reasonable explanation of the incriminating evidence against him.

1st Ground of Appeal: -

This is a matter that has been decided based on circumstantial evidence

against the appellant as there had been no eyewitnesses to the actual incident.

It is well settled law that to find an accused guilty based on circumstantial

evidence, the evidence must directly point to the guilt of the accused and

nothing else.

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz J.

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused

and inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his innocence.

Page 9 of 14

In Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01 it was held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the

offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can

be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved

beyond reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if

the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the

offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing

the offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

In assessing such circumstantial evidence, a trial judge also has to be mindful

that suspicious circumstances do not establish guilt and the burden of proving

a case beyond reasonable doubt against an accused is always with the

prosecution.

The appellant has been living with the deceased at the house where the body of

the deceased was found. He himself had admitted that he assaulted the

deceased due to a quarrel he had with her because of her failure to cook meals

for him and his brother, who was visiting the house. The fact that the brother

being there had been established by the evidence of the fellow toddy tapper

who happened to pass the house at that time. However, it was the appellants

position that when he came home later after leaving the house, he found the

deceased hanged by herself.

Page 10 of 14

The evidence led in this action clearly establishes the fact that the appellant

was not an innocent illiterate toddy tapper as he was attempting to portray, but

a master manipulator of the circumstances.

He was the paramour of the mother of the deceased who had a child with that

union. The deceased was just coming out of her teenage years when he eloped

with her after starting an affair with her too. He was smart enough to maintain

both the mother and the daughter at two houses, without the mother knowing

that he is living with her daughter as well, until she found out about her death.

It is clear from the evidence of the investigating police officers and the JMO

who visited the scene as a part of his postmortem examination that the rafter

the deceased was supposed to have used to hang herself was beyond her reach,

given her height. There had been nothing that could have been used as an aid

to reach the rafter in the room where the body of the deceased was lying when

the police and the JMO visited and even the neighbours and the owner of the

estate where they were living, came to the scene of the incident.

The appellant crying and pleading with the others to take the deceased to the

hospital cannot be taken as evidence suggestive of his concern on the wellbeing

of the deceased as claimed. I find that it may well be an attempt by the

appellant to mislead the persons gathered to show that it was a suicide.

The evidence of the JMO clearly establishes that the appellant had been very

careful to explain the major injuries that were visible on the body of the

decease to him. Upon being questioned by the JMO as to what happened, he

has explained that due to the quarrel he had with the deceased, he squeezed

her neck and pushed her and hit to the back of her neck using his right hand.

He has explained further, saying that when he found her hanging, he lifted her

and cut the rope using his toddy tapping knife, and the left side of her face hit

the cement floor when she fell as a result, and received injuries to the face.

However, the JMO has come to a firm finding that the death cannot be a

suicide as claimed. It was his view that the deceased had been strangulated by

the use of a rope and later she has been hanged by using the same rope to look

Page 11 of 14

like it was a suicide. He has well explained the reasons for his conclusions,

which has not been dented by cross examination.

The JMO has observed a total of 11 injuries in the body of the deceased, and

has opined that the injury number 04, namely, the injury he observed just

below the left ear of the deceased cannot be due to a fall, but in all probabilities

due to an assault using blunt force, which may result in the victim being fallen

unconscious. He has opined that such an injury can be caused if assaulted

using the blunt side of the handle of the production marked P-03.

The appellant who admittedly being the only person last seen with the

deceased and the only person who was with her when the neighbours came to

the scene after the incident, the only conclusion that can be reached is that it

was the appellant who is culpable for the death of the deceased.

This has been further established by the way he has acted even after he was

arrested and remanded as a suspect for the murder. He has got a fellow inmate

in the prison to write the letter marked P-01 to his brother who was seen in the

company of him and the deceased on that day, instructing him how to give his

statement to the police.

As admitted by the learned Presidents Counsel in his submissions before this

Court, the dock statement made by the appellant was also in line with what

was stated in the letter, which goes on to establish that the appellant is a

person who can plan things beforehand in order to get over situations as he

has done in this instance to portray that the death was a suicide.

The learned SSC in his submissions admitted that the learned High Court

Judge has not reason out adequately as to why he rejected the defence of the

appellant. However, in my view for that to be considered relevant, it needs to be

established that it has caused prejudice to the appellant which amounts to a

positive miscarriage of justice.

It is still an accepted legal principle in our country, although it has been done

away in almost all of the commonwealth jurisdictions that a dock statement of

Page 12 of 14

an accused has some legal value attached to it, subjected to the infirmities that

it was not made under oath and not subjected to the test of cross examination.

It was held in the case of In Queen Vs. Kularatne (1968) 71 NLR 529, that

while jurors must be informed that such a statement must be looked upon as

evidence, subject, however, to the infirmities that the accused statement is not

made under oath and not subject to cross examination.

Held further;

1. If the dock statement is believed it must be acted upon.

2. If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case for the

prosecution, the defence must succeed, and;

3. It must not be used against another accused.

The learned High Court Judge in his judgment at page 14 (Page 315 of the

Brief) has considered the dock statement in the following manner:

01

.

.

.

It may be correct to say that the learned High Court Judge should have

elaborated more on the dock statement of the appellant with the infirmities it

carries in his mind. However, I find that the learned High Court Judge has

analyzed the evidence with a clear understanding of the defence of the

appellant. In my view had it been considered any further, it would have been

in anyway rejected as it has not caused any doubt on the evidence of the

prosecution nor it was a reasonable explanation of the incriminating evidence

against him.

Page 13 of 14

It is my considered view that when taken the evidence in its totality, the charge

against the appellant has been proved beyond reasonable doubt and the

judgment need no interference by this Court.

2nd Ground of Appeal: -

Examples of concurrence principle adduced by the learned Presidents Counsel

can be found in the following Indian cases. (At page 54 of Criminal Law of Sri

Lanka-supra):

(1) Queen-Empress Vs. Khandu Valad Bhavani (1890) ILR 15 Bom

194

(2) Palani Goundan Vs. Emperor (1919) ILR 42, Mad 547: MLJ17

(F.B.)

In both these cases the accused struck the deceased with the intention to kill.

The deceased fell unconscious, but did not die. Believing that the person was

dead the accused disposed the body, in the first case by setting him on fire and

in the second case by hanging the deceased to make it look like a suicide.

Giving reasons based on intention on both these instances the court held that

it was not murder but attempt to commit murder.

However, in Queen-Empress Vs. Valad Bhavani (Supra) Parsons. J.

(dissenting) held that;

The accused with the deliberate intention of causing the death of his

father-in law gave him three blows on the head. He then took the body, put

abox under his head, and set fire to the hut in which it was. The result

was that the father-in-law, who had not been killed but only stunned by

the blows, was burnt to death. acts so closely following upon and so

intimately connected with each other that they cannot be separated and

assigned the to one intention which prompted the commission of those acts

and without which neither would have been done. In my opinion, the

accused in committing those acts is guilty of murder.

The only case in Sri Lanka that considered the above principle was the case of

King Vs. Loku Nona (Supra), where the Supreme Court followed the dissenting

Page 14 of 14

view expressed by Parsons,J. in Queen- Empress Vs. Khandu Valad Bhavani.

where it was stated that;

The accused struck C a blow on the head with a club and C fell senseless.

The accused believing that C was dead ordered the body to be put in to

sea, where the body sustained certain wounds. According to medical

evidence it was possible that C was not dead when she was thrown into

the sea, and that death was caused by concussion of the brain from

contact of the body with a rock in the sea.

Held:

The Accused was guilty of murder, even if the deceased was not

dead when thrown into to the sea and the death was by the body

coming into contact with a rock in the sea.

Judgment of the majority of the Court in Khandu (Supra) disapproved.

It is therefore clear that the concurrence principle has no place in our law, as it

has never been recognized by our Courts, hence, no merit in the contention of

the learned Presidents Counsel.

For the reasons aforementioned, I find no merit in the appeal. The appeal

therefore is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence affirmed.
