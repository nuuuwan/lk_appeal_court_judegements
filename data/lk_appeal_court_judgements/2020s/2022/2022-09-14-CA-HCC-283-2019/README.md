DECIDED ON : 14/09/2022

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The accused-appellant (the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of

Colombo for being in possession and trafficking 321.89 grams of heroin,

offences punishable in terms of section 54 A of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984. After trial, the

appellant was found guilty of both charges and sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

Counsel for the appellant relied on the following grounds of appeal.

3

1. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in relation to the non-production of

articles.

2. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in evaluating the evidence of the

Government Analyst.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has erred in evaluating the defence case.

4. The Learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself in the evaluation of the

prosecution case.

The prosecution case in brief:

A team of police officers of the Maligawatte police station left the police station

at 8.05 a.m. on the 10th of January, 2016, for daily police investigations. One

officer was in uniform, and the others were dressed in civilian clothing. Before

leaving, the officers and the vehicle were searched. PW1, who led the police

team, received information from a private informant around 10.00 a.m. that a

person carrying heroin in a backpack was coming to the Maligawatte Cemetery.

It was further informed that He was wearing a blue-coloured t-shirt and brown-

coloured trousers.

In response to the above information, PW1 stayed at the cemetery for about 20

to 30 minutes expecting the appellants arrival. He saw a person approaching

towards the cemetery, wearing an attire that was similar to the one described

by the informant. Upon seeing the person, PW1 directed PW2 Sub-Inspector

Manoj and PW3 PC 66357 Ratnayake to join him. They stopped the appellant.

PW1 then searched the appellant and found two mobile phones and his wallet.

When his backpack was searched, PW1 found five cellophane bags. Four

parcels out of five contained brown-coloured powder, and the other parcel

contained a black-coloured sticky lump. PW1, from his experience, identified

them as heroin. The appellant was arrested at 10.40 a.m., and the substance

was temporarily sealed at 10.50 a.m. The police team went with the appellant

4

to the Police Narcotics Bureau and weighed the heroin. After examining the

parcel, it had been identified as having contained heroin, and the total weight

of the brown powder was measured as 1 kg and 51 grams, while the black

lump weighed 125.61 grams.

The heroin was duly sealed and handed over to the person in charge of the

productions in the police station and later handed over to the Government

Analyst.

Defence case

The appellant made a dock statement. His position is that, he was arrested

from his residence in Wattala on the 10th of January 2016 at 1.00 a.m. He

made several telephone calls to his wife till 10.00 a.m., while he was under

arrest. The appellant stated that the heroin produced in the court was not in

his possession and was introduced to him by the police.

The defence called an officer from the mobile telephone service provider and

marked the phone call details of the two phone numbers 0723143658 and

07222791901 as V1 and V2.

The prosecution called PW1 after the defence case was closed as evidence in

rebuttal. PW1 stated that the appellant was arrested at 10.40 a.m., and the

appellants phones were handed over to the reserve police at 12.10p.m. as

personnel items of the appellant. No telephone calls were initiated when it was

in the custody of PW1.

The First ground of appeal is the non-production of the following items in

evidence, namely, a tulip bag (PR 51), a temporarily sealed envelope (PR 52)

and a red and black striped bag (PR 53).

5

PW1 Sub-Inspector Manjula stated that the items mentioned above were duly

handed over to the reserve officer PW 9 Chandraratne, after entering them in

the production register as PR 51, PR 52 and PR 53. Those three items are not

essential to prove the prosecution case. The prosecution has produced the

heroin detected from the appellant in court. PW 9 Chandraratne gave evidence

before court and stated that the items PR 51, PR 52 and PR 53 were handed

over to him by PW1, and he handed over the same to PW 10 Ranaweera. They

were again handed over to PW9, and he then handed them over to PW 13

Rohana. PW9 received them back from PW 13 Rohana and handed them over

to PW 14 Ratnayake.

PW9 was not cross-examined, and his evidence stands unchallenged. PW13

also gave evidence regarding the three items. PW 13 was not cross-examined,

and his evidence also stands unchallenged.

PW 14 Ratnayake gave evidence in court and stated that he received PR 51, PR

52 and PR 53 from PW9 on the 12th of January 2016. He further stated that

the three items were misplaced in the police station and could not be found.

PW 14 was not cross-examined by the defence, and his evidence stands

unchallenged.

In the case of Gunasiri and Two others vs Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SRI LR

39, Justice Sisira de Abrew, quoting from the Indian Judgment of Sarwan

Singh vs State of Punjab, stated that,

In this connection, I would like to consider certain judicial decisions. In the case

of Sarwan Singh vs State of Punjab, Indian Supreme Court held thus: It is a rule

of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to avail himself of

the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination, it must follow that the

evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted. This judgment was cited

with approval in Bobby Mathew vs State of Karnataka.

6

Considering the above facts and law, I hold that the first ground of appeal has

no merit and I reject the same.

The second ground of appeal is based on the corrections made to the

Government Analysts report by the Government Analyst herself.

The Government Analysts report was produced in evidence and marked P18.

The Government Analyst stated that there was a mistake in the report to say

that in paragraph 3 of the report, instead of black coloured powder it should

be a solid substance.

The learned High Court Judge allowed this correction, because it was a

genuine mistake. The defence had the opportunity to challenge the report in

cross-examination. The defence cross-examined the Government Analyst only

in regard to the correction. It was revealed in the analysis that the solid

substance contained 21.62 grams of heroin and the brown-coloured powder

contained 300.25 grams of heroin. However, this was not challenged in the

cross-examination. Instead, the defence counsel alleged that the Government

Analyst gave evidence to support the version of the prosecution. It is to be

noted that the Government Analyst herself gave evidence in court. She had

come to the pinnacle of her career. She was the Government Analyst at the

time the productions were handed over to the Government Analyst department.

The learned Counsel for the respondent pointed out that the Government

Analyst had nothing to achieve by supporting the prosecution case.

The learned High Court Judge has carefully evaluated the Government

Analysts report. In view of the above, I hold that this argument has no merit.

The next argument is that the learned High Court Judge had not evaluated the

defence case. The position of the appellant is that he was arrested at his house

in Wattala at about 1.00 a.m. and brought to the Maligawatte police station.

7

His position is that he had made several telephone calls to his wife while under

arrest. The defence produced the call records of the appellants mobile phone,

taken on the 1stof October 2016. However, the position of the prosecution is

that the appellant was arrested at the Maligawatte cemetery at 10.40 a.m. PW

1 handed over the appellants phone to the reserve police of the Maligawatte

police station at 12.10 p.m.. From10.40 a.m., to 12.10 p.m., there were no

calls generated from the mobile phone of the appellant. It is difficult to believe

that the police allowed the appellant to take calls from his phone six times,

while he was under arrest. Furthermore, all the calls were generated in the

area of Maligawatte. The learned High Court Judge has observed that no calls

were generated from the Wattala area. Having carefully considered the call

records and the evidence, the learned High Court Judge had come to the

conclusion that the defence evidence did not create a reasonable doubt in the

prosecution case. I see no reason to disagree with the findings of the learned

Trial Judge.

The next point raised for the appellant is that the learned High Court Judge

has misdirected himself in the evaluation of the prosecution case.

It is argued that the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2, with regard to what they had

done from 8.05 a.m. to 10.00 a.m. varied from each other. This position was

clearly dealt with by the learned High Court Judge in para 29 of the judgment.

and observed that there were no contradictions. Therefore, this argument has

no substance, and I reject the same.

The last point raised by the appellant is that the learned High Court Judge has

come to the conclusion that the appellant was guilty before considering the

defence evidence. This argument cannot be accepted.

Before a judgment is written, a judge thoroughly reads the whole case record

and then comes to a conclusion regarding all issues.

8

If a Judge writes the conclusion first and then sets forth the reasons for doing

so, no one can say that the Judge has put the cart before the horse; it does not

vitiate a judgment. Everything need not be in chronological order.

There is no specific format for writing a judgment. What should be contained

in a judgment of the High Court is specified in section 283 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

Counsel for the respondent also pointed out that the witnesses had no

animosity towards the appellant. Further, if the police introduced the drugs to

the appellant, questions arise, as to why they should introduce 321.0 grams of

heroin which is a large quantity and how the police could find such a huge

amount of heroin. As per the provisions of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance, if a person is found in possession of two grams or more of

heroin, the prescribed punishment is the life sentence or death sentence.

321.0 grams of heroin can be considered as a huge amount compared to 2.0

grams. When considering the evidence as a whole, there is no reason to

interfere with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant is

affirmed, and the appeal is dismissed.
