JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General under Section 296 of the

Penal Code for committing the murder of Abeysinghe Mudiyanselage

Ariyaratna Banda on 16/04/2007 in the High court of Kurunegala.

As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led seven witnesses and marked production

P1-10 and closed the case. After concluding that evidence presented by the

prosecution warranted a case to answer, the Learned High Court Judge

called for defence and explained the rights of the accused. He had chosen

the right to give evidence from the witness box and had closed his case.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as

charged and imposed death sentence on 24/07/2017.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. At the hearing the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The High Court Judge has failed to consider the contradictions and

omissions of the evidence given by PW1.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has not considered the evidence

favourable to the Appellant in his judgment.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has rejected the defence evidence at

the wrong premises and failed to consider the evidence of the Appellant

which suffices to create a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According PW1, the wife of the deceased, when she was watching TV with

the deceased and her granddaughter in her house, she heard a knock on the

boutique door owned by her son. It is situated about 100 meters away from

her house. As it was in the night, both the witness and the deceased had

gone up to the boutique to check who had knocked the door, however was

unable to see anybody there at that time. When they came back home, they

heard another loud knock on the door again from the same direction. They

went again to check if anybody was there, yet there was no one at that time.

When they reached home, the knock on the boutique door resumed and both,

the deceased and the witness proceeded to the boutique. The deceased was

walking 10-15 feet ahead of PW1 and he suddenly screamed that Podde

had cut him. Then PW1 saw Podde, the Appellant was fleeing the scene.

The witness was able to see the Appellant through the torch light which she

was holding and through the boutiques light. She also mentioned that the

deceased was carrying a torch at that time. The deceased had died on the

spot.

Officers from the Gokarella Police Station had conducted investigations,

visited the scene, and recovered a pole, two torch lights and a small knife

4 | P a g e

from the crime scene. Also noted the damages caused to the boutique.

Accordingly, the Appellant was arrested on 18/04/2007 at his residence.

PW4 Nilmini was called to give evidence regarding a knife which had been

taken from her by the Appellant. She was shown the knife which had been

recovered from the crime scene and she identified the knife as the knife

which had been taken away by the Appellant some time back. The said knife

was marked as PW2.

The JMO who conducted the post-mortem of the deceased revealed that the

death was caused by stab injuries to the neck and the chest.

After the closure of the prosecution case, the defence was called and the

Appellant had given evidence from witness box and denied the charge.

As the Appellants proposed grounds of appeal are interrelated with regard

to the admission of the evidence in this case, it is determined to analyse all

the grounds of appeal together in this appeal.

According to PW1, the deceased had screamed that the Appellant had cut

him when they went to check the boutique after hearing banging on the door

third time in quick succession. At the cross examination, the witness had

said that she heard like several people had knocked the door on the third

time. At the inquest PW1 had stated that she heard the sound about 7-8

people knocking the door. However, during the trial before High Court the

witness had said that she was unaware as to how many people had knocked

up to now. The said contradiction was marked as X-1 by the prosecution.

PW10 was the Officer-in-Charge of the Gokarella Police Station. Upon

receiving the complaint regarding the death of the Appellant, he had gone to

the place of incident at about 23.40 hours on the same day. Only a torch

light that had fallen at the scene of crime was lighting at the time. The main

switch board and the bulbs of the shop had been damaged. A pole, two torch

lights, a small knife and an iron rod had been recovered from the scene. The

Appellant was arrested on 18/04/2007 at his residence.

5 | P a g e

With the evidence of the investigating officer, it is quite clear that several

people had participated in the crime. But PW1 restricting the identity to one

person, told court that the deceased had uttered that Podde had cut him.

Although, this case rests on the dying declaration of the deceased, the

Learned High Court Judge had not discussed the law pertaining to the

acceptance of dying declaration of the deceased in the judgment.

As this case solely relies on the dying declaration made by the deceased, it

is very important to discuss the applicable laws pertaining to the acceptance

of dying declaration as evidence, which had not been done in this case.

Hence, it is appropriate to mention following decided cases.

In Dharmawansa Silva and Another v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1981]

2 Sri.L.R.439 it was held:

When a dying statement is produced, three questions arise for the Court.

Firstly, whether it is authentic. Secondly, if it is authentic whether it is

admissible in whole or part. Thirdly, the value of the whole or part that is

admitted. A dying deposition is not inferior evidence but it is wrong to give

it added sanctity

In Sigera v Attorney General [2011] 1 Sri.L.R. 201 it was held that:

An accused can be convicted of murder based mainly and solely on a

dying declaration made by a deceased.

In this case, although PW1 stated that the deceased had only said that

Podde had cut him, the Learned High Court Judge, in her judgment had

stated that PW1 had seen the Appellant cutting the deceased. Upon perusal

of the evidence given by PW1, nowhere had stated that she had witnessed

that the Appellant had cut the deceased. This is entirely the creation of the

court. The relevant portion of the Judgment is re-produced below:

(Page 246 of the brief)

The Learned High Court Judges aforementioned decision has prejudiced the

Appellants right to a fair trial.

As stated above, no suitable lighting conditions were present when the

investigating officer arrived at the crime scene. The boutiques main switch

was broken, and there was insufficient light to adequately recognize a person

properly.

Further, consideration of third-party involvement had been completely

escaped from the attention of the Learned High Court Judge. According to

PW1, she had stated at the inquest that 7-8 people would have had knocked

the door of the boutique. According to the investigating officer, he had

observed damages had been done to the boutique and he had recovered two

torch lights and a pole from the crime scene. This demonstrates evidence of

involvement of multiple persons. But the prosecution had failed to mention

in the indictment the participation of individuals unknown to the

prosecution.

In Emperor v. Brown [1917] 18 Cri.L.J. 482 the court held that:

the jury must decide whether the facts proven exclude the possibility

that the act was done by some other person, and if they have doubts

the prisoner must have the benefits of those doubts.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General in keeping with the highest tradition

of the Attorney General Department had left the matter to be decided by this

court.

With all the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defence, it

appears that the Learned High Court Judge had not appropriately evaluated

the evidence in delivering her verdict.

7 | P a g e

In this case, the evidence given by the PW1 is tainted with uncertainty and

ambiguity and it certainly does not pass the probability test.

Therefore, I conclude that the prosecution had not succeeded in adducing

highly incriminating evidence against the Appellant and thereby has not

established the charge beyond reasonable doubt.

Taking into consideration all these circumstances, I am of the view that the

conviction of the Appellant cannot be allowed to stand as the prosecution

had failed to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt. The Appeal is

allowed and the Appellant is acquitted from the charge.

The appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Kurunegala along with the original case record.
