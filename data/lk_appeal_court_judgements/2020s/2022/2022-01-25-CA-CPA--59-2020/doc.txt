Counsel Anura Meddegoda PC with Asela Muthumudalige for the

Claimant Applicant Appellant Petitioner.

Kanishka Rajakaruna SC for the State.

Argued On 12.01.2022

Decided On 25.01.2022

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the orders of

the Magistrates Courtdelivered on 9.7.2019 and the order dated 3.3.20

delivered by the High Court.

The Claimant Applicant Appellant Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

petitioner) had been the registered owner of Vehicle nu NWPC3161 and he

had been having a rent a car business which had been a registered business.

In the said business the petitioner had rented out the vehicle mentioned

above to a person by the name of Nagaspitiyegedara Sunil.

The said Sunil had obtained the vehicle on an agreement drawn between

the Petitioner and the said Sunil. The said agreement had been marked and

is part and parcel of the petition .According to the said agreement the

above mentioned Sunil is obligated to maintain the vehicle during the

period, and the said agreement is also marked and is part and parcel of the

petition.

In the said agreement the said Sunil had undertaken to maintain the vehicle

and not to engage the vehicle in illegal activities,

Page 5 of 6

.But on the 9th of June 2019 the above mentioned vehicle and Sunil and the

cleaner of the vehicle were taken in to custody for being in possession of

imported cigarettes without paying taxes.

As such Sunil was charged under the provisions of the act and the charge

sheet had been filed under section 15 (1) of the Tobacco Tax Act.

The Counsel for the petitioner argued that it is a defective charge because it

does not specify an offence committed under a specific law, hence

everything which stems from that is also defective.

The Counsel appearing for the respondents conceded that in the charge

filed only the penal section is stated and not the section specifying the

offence, but he submitted that the accused had not been misled because

the charge has described the offence and the accused had pleaded guilty

which shows that he was not misled as said in section 166 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure.

In view of the submissions of the Counsel for the respondents the charge is

incomplete as per the provisions of the Code of Criminal procedure Code

but in the same Code it is stated as to how an incomplete charge should be

looked at.

The relevant section says that the suspect or the accused person should not

be misled in such an instance if so then the accused or the suspect is

deemed to have been prejudiced.

In the instant matter the accused had tendered a plea to the charge and in

the body of the charge the particulars of the offence had been stated

although the correct section had not been cited.

As such this Court is unable to accept the contention put forward by the

learned Counsel for the petitioner that there was no proper charge framed.

But in view of the documents filed by the petitioner marked as V1 and V2 it

is very clear that the petitioner had been running a rent a car service and

the said Sunil had rented out the vehicle from him and in the said

agreement the petitioner had added a clause stating that the vehicle

should not be used for any illegal activities and just 3 days prior to the

expiration of the contract the alleged incident had taken place, therefore it

is the opinion of this Court that the probability of the petitioners knowledge

of the alleged incident is very unlikely because the physical control of the

vehicle was not with the petitioner.

As such according to the provisions of the relevant act before confiscating

the tools used in an offence the claimant of the said tools has to be heard

and he has to prove on acceptable terms to Court that he had no

knowledge of the incident.

In the instant matter the knowledge of the petitioner has not been

adequately considered by the learned High Court Judge and the Magistrate.

As such the instant application for revision is allowed and the impugned

orders of the High Court and the Magistrate Court are hereby set aside.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
