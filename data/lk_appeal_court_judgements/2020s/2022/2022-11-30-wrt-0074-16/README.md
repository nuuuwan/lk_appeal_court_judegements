The Facts of the case briefly are as follows. The Petitioners father had obtained title to the

land in dispute by a partition decree in case no P7663. The said land consisting of 21 P had a

single-storied old house and two shops, premises bearing assessment no 78 & 80. Subsequent

to a partition action the petitioner had got lot I in the plan marked as P2 which consisted of the

old house in the extent of 17.24P and her sister had got title to Lot 2. Part of the said lot 2 had

been acquired for the construction of a road. After the acquisition, the front portion of the two

shops had been demolished. The petitioner submitted that slightly less than three perches of

the said Lot had been acquired for the construction of the road. The said acquisition had taken

place prior to the preparation of plan P2 in January 2014. The petitioner alleges that

subsequently, her sister had sold the remaining 1.13P of lot 1 to the 7th Respondent. The 7th

Respondent had thereafter sold it to the present owner 7A Respondent. It is alleged that the

new owners had demolished the existing partly demolished two shops and had put up a three-

storied construction which is used as a commercial premise containing shops in the said land.

The Petitioner further alleges that the said approval granted for the construction is violative of

the law and thereby the said decision is arbitrary, illegal, ultravires, biased, and made for

collateral purposes. Further, she alleges that the said construction too is violative of the UDA

law and regulations and is causing a hindrance to her property. It is also submitted that the new

construction has kept open areas facing her property and the rainwater outlet is allowed to fall

into her property. It is further submitted that there are loosely hanging name boards hung

projecting to her premises which are all violations of the UDA regulations on construction. She

further alleges that despite her objections and request for relief the 4th, 5th & 6th Respondents

have failed to grant her any relief pertaining to the illegal construction hence this application

for a writ.

Petitioners complaint to the Court

Despite several complaints being lodged with the 4th, 5th & 6th Respondents permission had

been granted by the said Respondents to the construction in violation of the UDA Development

and Building Regulations.

The Petitioner states that the aforesaid construction by the 7th Respondent is illegal as it is

contrary to several regulations made in terms of Section 8(e) of the Urban Development

Amendment Act No 4 of 1982 in respect of Matara Municipality for the following among other

reasons.

(i) The building line according to schedule 3 of Volume II of the said Regulation of (at

page 55) and Regulation 10.2.3 (iv) of Volume I is 15 meters from the mid of the

road but the construction of the 7th Respondent has encroached into the aforesaid

building line.

(ii) The new construction has encroached into the Street Line.

(iii) The rare space has not been kept according to Regulation 26 in Volume II.

5

(iv) The minimum plan area for the construction of a building does not exist in the

premises owned by the 7 Respondent. (Regulation 15 read with Schedule 3, format

(g) of Volume II)

(v) Since the 7 Respondent demolished the old single-storied building and started

constructing a new two-storied building it has to be considered as a new building

and new construction and the procedure for approval for new construction has not

been followed.

(vi) The 4 Respondent Municipal Council of Matara has purportedly approved a

building plan for a building constructed contrary to the Urban Development

Authority Regulation.

The Petitioner has sought the following relief among others from this Court

(b) Grant a mandate against the 4th 5th and 6th Respondents in the nature of a writ of

Certiorari quashing the purported approval granted under BA 11/2015 which was

conveyed to the Petitioner and/or reflected by letter marked P26, to the construction

of the building within the premises bearing No 78 Akuressa Rd Matara which is also

described as Lot 2 in the Plan No.3499 dated 23.1.2014 prepared by HJ Samarapala

Licensed Surveyor marked as P 2,

(c) Grant a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari against the 4th 5 and 6th

Respondents quashing the decision of the 4th and/or 5th and/or 6th Respondents which

was conveyed to the Petitioners and/or reflected by the letter marked P 26 granting the

approval to the construction of a building/part of a building within premises bearing

No 78, Akuressa Rd, Matara which is also described as Lot 2 depicted in Plan No 3499

dated 23.1.2014 prepared by H.J Samarapala Licensed Surveyor marked P2

6

(d) Grant a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus compelling the 1 to 6th

Respondents to remove and/or caused to be removed according to law, The

unauthorized construction made on premises No 78, Akuressa Road, Matara which is

also described as Lot 2 in the plan No 3499 dated 23.1.2014 prepared by H. J

Samarapala Licenses Surveyor marked P2;

In essence, the petitioners main grievance is that the approvals given by the 4th, 5th & 6th

Respondents are contrary to several Regulations made pursuant to section 8e of the Urban

Development Act no 4 of 1982 as amended. The crux of the petitioners argument was based

on the following;

that the development is in violation of the building line set out in Schedule 3 of volume

ii of the UDA regulations mainly regulation no 10.2.3(iv)

The approval for the development is in violation of the street lines requirement and the

requirement for rear space.

The minimum floor plan area required for the development under regulation 15 read

with Schedule 3 of volume ii does not exist.

The 7th Respondent despite several notices being sent by this Court has failed to take part in

the proceedings of the Court. Subsequently, the petitioner submitted that the 7th Respondent

had transferred the property to another party who had been added as 7A Respondent. It was

further submitted that despite notices being issued on several occasions the 7A Respondent too

had failed to appear before this Court thus making him absent and unrepresented.

The learned counsel appearing for the 1st to 3rd Respondent on 23.07.18 informed this Court

that they will not be filing any objections to the application as there is no substantial relief

preyed against the said Respondents. However, reserved the right to assist the Court at the

argument stage and after arguments with the permission of the Court, they filed a written

submission.

7

4th, 5th & 6th Respondents objected to the petitioners application on the basis that the

petitioners claim does not fall within the grounds for judicial review thus the argument that

this application has to fail. This objection was based on the premise that the decision taken has

not been challenged on the basis that it falls within the ambit of illegality, irrationality, and

procedural impropriety. This Court will consider the said objections with the petitioners claim.

It is not disputed that the municipal Council limits of Matara have been declared as an urban

development area. It is also common ground that the 1st Respondent had delegated its powers

pertaining to the development and other related matters acting in pursuance of section 23(5) of

the UDA Act as amended, to the 4th, and 6th Respondents (P1 and P1a). Accordingly, the

authority to approve construction under UDA development and building Regulations is

delegated to the 4th, & 6th Respondents.

It is the contention of the petitioner that her sister who had title to lot 2 of the disputed land

had transferred her rights to the 7th Respondent by deed no 2917 dated 27.4.15(P8). It was also

the contention of the petitioner that the 7th Respondent had thereafter demolished the existing

remains of the two shops and had started a new construction without proper approval and that

too was for a two-storied building. The petitioner has demonstrated the state of the existing two

shops, and the new construction by photographic evidence(P10(1)-P(11(xiv)and also p 32(1)-

P40(v). These photographs were not challenged by the Respondents and they clearly

demonstrate that the new construction is two-storied but has provision to go higher up as

reflected in the photos. It is further argued that the new construction has iron and columns

drawn up from the 2nd-floor slab for the construction of a 3rd-floor.

The petitioner submitted that when the alleged construction commenced, she had submitted

several complaints to the 5th and 6th Respondents (P12, P12A, P13, P13A, P14, and P15,

P18.She has also complained to the grama niladhari and the police (P16, P17) She has also

complained to the 1st and 2nd Respondents P21, P22, and P27A about the alleged illegal and

unauthorized construction. After several complaints to the authorities without any redress, the

petitioner got a reply from the 5th Respondent. The said reply states as follows;

Thus, the petitioners contention that the decision reflected in the said letter P26 giving

permission to construct is ultravires, illegal bias, unreasonable, and in violation of the UDA

Development and Building Regulations.

The 5th Respondent contended that the said construction had been approved and therefore the

construction is not illegal. It was their contention that since the front portion of the land in

dispute had been acquired for road widening the front portions of the buildings had been

demolished and that there was a mandatory requirement to renovate the face of the building.

However, due to the limited space availability in the remaining portion of the land, the 5th

Respondent contended that they had considered the ground floor of the remaining part of the

existing building as a renovation, and as the plan submitted for approval 5R7 had a second

floor which was considered new construction. It was their contention that since the ground

floor was a renovation the applicability of the street lines and the building line limitation had

been done away but for the new construction of the first floor, the same was to apply. Thus,

they submitted that the first floor should be built after observing the street lines and the other

requirements under the building regulations. Further, the 5th Respondent had varied the

requirement to have mandatory clearance of the rear space and had allowed it to be kept from

the eastern side.

Application by the Petitioners sister

At this stage, it is pertinent to consider the application that had been made by the applicant who

is seeking permission to develop the land. The said application consisting of several

attachments was tendered to the Court by the 5th Respondent marked as 5R6 to 5R11. However,

the said application does not disclose that it is an application for a renovation of existing

premises. What is disclosed is an application for an amendment to the existing premises.

This Court observes that though the town planning and zonal regulations mandate the approval

of renovations, and amendments the plan that is submitted for approval should clearly define

the old or the existing building and the proposed renovations/amendments in different colors

10

the plan submitted to this Court does not display such a contrast. The inspection report prior to

issuing a development permit which was marked as 5R9 under clause 15 specifically requests

to answer the question as to whether the proposed amendments are depicted in red and the

answer is in the negative. It is pertinent to note that as per the 5th Respondents contention if

the proposed construction was for an amendment to the ground floor, then the old building

should have been depicted in one colour. However, the failure of the developer to follow the

guidelines of the colour coding in the plan demonstrates that from the inception their intention

had been to construct a new building rather than effecting an amendment to the existing ground

floor.

The petitioner argued that the said two shops had long been abundant and not used thus when

the portion of land was acquired for the road construction the said building was already in a

delipidated condition. Therefore, they argued that the necessity for renovation subsequent to

the acquisition does not arise.

The 5the Respondent submitted that as per the application the applicant had declared it as a

renovation of an existing building. However, the documents presented to this Court

demonstrate it is for an amendment . As submitted by the petitioner this

court is also of the view that an amendment has to be in incompliance with the regulations.

Failure to tender necessary documents with the application for renovations/amendments

purported to hide the true motive thus the application should have been rejected

The petitioner contended that before an application for renovation or for amendment is made

there should be an approved subdivision of the disputed lot where the development is to take

place. However, it is the petitioners contention that no such sub-division plan had been

approved and the Respondents have failed to tender any approved sub-division to this Court.

The application for a subdivision had been made vide 6R1,6R2A. However, no approved

subdivision plan had been tendered to this Court. It was the contention of the petitioner that the

failure to submit the subdivision was to hide the unavailability of the minimum required space

for construction under the UDA regulations. It was further contended that in the absence of

such subdivision the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents could not have proceeded or entertain the

11

application for an amendment. thus, making the whole process illegal and the act of

entertaining an incomplete application and considering the same an act of ultravires.

The 5th Respondent had replied to this application by letter dated 19.12.2014 6R3 and had

informed as follows;

. . 3617

2012.11.25 02

.

This reply demonstrates that it was the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents who had suggested sending

the application for the development of an existing building and also demonstrates that the

granting of the approval would be subject to the UDA Development and Building regulations.

It appears that thereafter the petitioners sister had made an application for the development of

the two shops bearing no 78 and 80(6R4 and 6R5a) subsequently an application has been

tendered marked Y, as well as 6R6which, which is also marked 5R6. It is pertinent to note that

the column that states when the application was received by the 6th Respondent, is not filled

nor is the signature of the commissioner visible. In the said application under section B, what

the owners proposed to do is not clearly demonstrated. it does not specify whether it is a

renovation or new construction but what is written there is the word amendment. Annexure(i)

it stets that the entire square area of the building is only 28.25 square meters.

Under the column the present position it says floors as 2. However, as submitted by the

Petitioner and this Court observes that the photographic evidence as well as the Grama Sewaka

report (5R5B) demonstrates that what is in existence is a single-storied building. Further, it

12

says the proposed development would consist of 91 % of the available square area. The plan is

annexed to the application. Report 6R8 the Technical Officer/Public Health Inspector s

Report after an inspection answers the 2nd question, stating that it is a new construction but had

recommended the proposed development.

Thereafter by 6R10, the planning committee had approved the said development as per the

application submitted and also had varied the requirements for keeping the rear space and

allowed it to be kept from the east. It further states that they had approved the development

considering the ground floor to be part of the existing building but had imposed a condition

that the first floor is constructed only towards the rear portion of the first-floor slab so that it is

in compliance with the building line.

The Petitioner argues that plan 6R7 submitted for the approval of the development, depicts the

construction of two floors on a new foundation, new walls, and columns making it a new

construction. Hence it was her contention that the said application cannot be considered as an

application for renovation or amendment but should have been considered as a new

construction to which the building regulations should strictly be applied.

The Petitioner also submits without conceding that even if the ground floor is considered an

existing building as per the approved plan still the 1st floor should have commenced from half

of the first-floor slab, but as demonstrated by the photographic evidence the said floor which

the 4th, 5th, 6thth Respondents too concede as new construction has violated the building line

and occupies the same floor area as of the ground floor. It was also contended that as per the

photographic evidence that there is no rear space kept at all(P39).P39(1). The Petitioners as

well as the 1st and 2nd Respondents also submitted that what is now constructed is a three-

storied building that has never been approved.

The second argument of the petitioner is that even if the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents have granted

the approval the said approval is contrary to the regulations.

13

The approval granted for an amendment to an existing building is contrary to the

building regulations.

The Petitioners main argument is based on the premise that the approval granted violates the

building regulations. The said building regulation has been tendered to this Court marked P30.

As per the building regulation clause 19, it is imperative to observe the street lines and the

building lines. The exception or the amount that deviation is allowed is specified under

subclause (3) This would be an appropriate time to consider clause 19(3) of the building

regulations which allows taking into consideration some constructions, in view of granting the

permit for development. The said regulation 19(3) states as follows;

. (1.0) ,

.

It is observed that as per the sub-regulation (3) the 4th,5th & 6th Respondent has some discretion

to vary the application of the street line and the building line. However, it has to be done in

accordance, with, and within the meaning of the sub-regulation. As submitted by the Petitioner

the planning committee cannot disregard the said regulation and permit an entire floor or

construction to be done in violation of the requirements stipulated nor can they allow new

construction to take place in the guise of an amendment disregarding and deviating from the

clauses in the UDA zonal development and building regulations.

Does the intended construction area qualify for development under the building

regulations?

14

The Petitioner contended that for the 4th, 5th, and 6th Respondents to approve a subdivision

plan for development purposes no such plan has been forwarded and no such plan has been

forwarded to this Court. Even if there was a subdivision plan for it to be approved for

development purposes there should be compliance with planning and construction regulations

within the Matara Municipal Limits which are depicted in P30.

As per 3rd Schedule form E() it clearly depicts the application of regulation 17 which

describes the minimum land parcel that qualifies for development. All parties were not at

variance on the fact that as per the regulation, there should be a minimum of 150 Square Meters

with a minimum of 6m in width. As contented It is observed by this Court that in the

application for the proposed development, submitted pertaining to lots 78 & 80 the minimum

square area to be utilized is given as 28.25sqm (5R6) the approximate square area of the land

is given as 25.91sqm. This is a violation of the Regulations as it does not qualify under the

minimum required land area for any development activity. Thus, the petitioners contention

that the said development application should have been rejected by the 4th 5th, and 6th

Respondents have merit in view of his contention that the application is not for an amendment

but for new construction. Accordingly, the Petitioner contends the said approval in the 1st

instance itself is a violation of the UDA regulations.

In response, the Respondents submitted that considering the fact that the front portion of the

buildings which were in existence in lot 2 and which had been damaged due to road widening

had to be renovated, but due to insufficient land area they were unable to grant permission for

development work they had considered the Petitioners application as for an amendment to the

premises which would not attract the minimum land area requirement. It was also submitted

that in any way the said Respondents had the right to relax some of the requirements for the

purpose of granting approval under regulation 17(3) which this Court has briefly dealt with

above. This Court will consider this response further in a while.

The Learned counsel for the Petitioner vehemently rejected this submission of the Respondents

on the basis that even her own sister who was the predecessor in title to the 7th and 7A

Respondent had got her title to the land to be developed only after the acquisition of part of the

15

said land for road construction. Therefore, it was submitted that by the time she got the title the

two buildings situated therein bearing no 78 and 80 had long been partly demolished and what

she inherited was a dilapidated, overgrown with weeds, partially demolished building.

Therefore, it is the position of the Petitioner that since the buildings were partially demolished

long before her sister had even got the title the assumption that its an amendment to an existing

building or an urgent amendment in view of the acquisition of part of the land cannot be

sustained.

It was further argued that if the minimum square area was not available the 4th, 5th & 6th

Respondents should not have granted approval at all but should have rejected the application

for non-compliance with the building requirements under the regulations. Thus, making the

entire process of accepting and granting approval tainted with irregularity and illegality.

In any event, the Petitioner submitted that the 4th, 5th & 6th Respondents could not consider the

development applications as an amendment, in view of the document 5R8 and the material

submitted for approval. In the said document under question no 2 which poses the question as

to whether the construction is a new construction the answer given is in the affirmative.

Bringing the attention of the Court to building approved plan 5R7 it was argued that in fact

what has been approved in the said plan is only the construction of a small portion which is to

the rear part of the first floor.

In response, the respondents submitted that there is no approval needed for the ground floor as

it is considered as an existing building. It is also pertinent to note that even if the ground floor

was considered as an existing building if it is an amendment then the proposed amendment

should be considered as it has to be in accordance with the regulations. The only exception

being a renovation which is not relevant to the present context of this case.

However, it is observed by this Court and as per the photographic evidence that has been

submitted and as per the drawings in 5R7 the building on the ground floor is too a new

16

construction. Though this proposition was presented at the argument stage the 5,6 7th

Respondents failed to explain this observation which was made by Court.

As per clause 19 of the regulation it is not permitted to encroach and construct within the street

lines and the building lines except under clause 19(3) which does not have any relevance in

this instance. Thus the petitioners contention that the application fail to qualify evan to be

processed.

The requirement to have a rear space

It was common ground that Pursuant to regulation 26, for the construction to be approved the

requirement for rear space should be adhered to. Regulation 26(1) identifies the requirement

to maintain the rear space of 3m to be kept open. The Petitioner contends that the rear space

of the construction is bordering her property and the 7th Respondent has failed to observe the

said requirement. It is her contention that the approval could not have been granted as after

observing the requirements for street lines and building lines there is no space to maintain the

rear space.

In response, it was submitted that the Respondents had considered the said fact before approval

was granted, and acting under regulation 26 subclause 4 the Respondents had waived the

requirement to observe the rear space as stipulated in 26(1) but had permitted the same to be

kept from the eastern side of the development block. It was argued that this decision had been

taken in view of the insufficient space available in the rear part of the development site. This

Court will now consider the said regulation 26(4). The said subclause states as follows;

17

It is correct that the building regulations permit the relaxing of the strict compliance of

regulation 26 (1). However, it is permitted only in specific instances where the land sought to

be developed is of an odd shape. It does not allow the Respondents to disregard the applicability

of regulation 26 (1) or to vary the application of the said regulation as and when the

Respondents like.

After considering the said regulation this Court is not inclined to subscribe to the 4th,5th & 6th

Respondents arguments on the power vested with them to vary the requirement of the rear

space. Plaine reading of the said subclause clearly demonstrates that it can be utilized only in

instances where the land parcel for the proposed development is in an odd shape and the said

odd shape does not permit the reservation of rear space as contemplated under regulation 26(1).

In our view, the approving authority can vary the requirement of the rear space only if it fulfills

the requirements under Regulation 26(4). However, as per all the documents submitted to this

Court and the documents that have been submitted for approval for the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents

which are annexed to the objections of the Respondents this Court cannot find an odd shape in

the plan submitted for approval. Accordingly, in the view of this Court, this is not an instance

that attracts subclause 26(4). Thus, in our view, the said approval granted to vary the subclause

under 26(4) cannot be justified.

Are the development within the stipulated building line and street line?

18

The Regulation marked as P30, 4th part defines what the building line and the street lines are.

All the parties were not at variance on the fact that there should be 15 m reservations for the

building line. It is common ground that the building application submitted for approval depicts

only a 12m distance out of the required 15m building line. To overcome this the 4th,5th & 6th

Respondents had considered the ground floor as an existing building. In these circumstances,

it was the contention of the Respondents that there was no encroachment on the building line.

However, the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents submitted that in order to come to this decision they

considered the application as an application to renovate/amend an existing building. Thus, they

had allowed the requirement to be waived off for the ground floor. But insisted on maintaining

the said line for the 1st floor. However, as per the photographic evidence that has been

submitted to this Court all parties were not in dispute on the fact that the construction depicted

in the said photographs is in violation of this requirement and the approval granted.

It is the contention of the Respondent that the planning committee of the 4th Respondent council

can waive off and recommend variations for new constructions which may not be in accordance

with the regulations. They also said that the said power is given to the planning committee by

the regulations themselves. The Respondent heavily relied on UDA regulations marked as P30

especially regulation 17(3), to justify their varying and deviating from the other mandatory

requirements that are stipulated in the said regulations.

Let us consider Regulation 17(3) which state as follows;

.

Thus it was argued that the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents had the authority to change and or to vary

the building regulations and permit the construction though at face value it violates the building

Regulations. It was further contended that the approval granted was within the power vested

19

to the said Respondents under the building regulations and the said decision is not ultravires

illegal or the said process does not attract the allegation of following an irregular procedure.

While disagreeing with the said submissions this Court observes that there is leverage given to

the planning committee to relax some of the regulations subject to what is stated in 17(3). It is

pertinent to observe that the planning committee can only utilize this provision to vary

requirements, if only the development fulfills the other requirements that are stipulated in the

said regulations. And that too the discretion is given to the planning committee only to vary

regulations pertaining to the square area and the width of the land parcel. It does not give

unlimited freedom for the planning committee to vary and disregard the provisions contained

in the building Regulations

The Respondents objections

4th,5th & 6th Respondents relying on civil Service Union Vs Minister for the Civil Service

(GCHQ case 3AER 935) contended that the Petitioners have failed to demonstrate the existence

of any ground for the grant of a writ, namely grounds for illegality, irrationality, and procedural

impropriety in the decision the planning committee had taken.

In considering all the facts and the materials submitted we are not inclined to agree with the

said objections. As demonstrated above in the judgment we find the 4th 5th and 6th Respondents

have clearly violated and misinterpreted and misapplied the regulations for the benefit of the

developer who made the application to develop lots 78 and 80. The said application has been

submitted on the basis of an amendment. As submitted by the Petitioner this Court agrees that

the said development application should have been rejected when it was tendered, as the said

application is not a proper application in the sense that the particulars furnished contradict each

20

other and also it lacks the basic information called for, even to consider as an application for

development purposes under the UDA regulations. Nowhere does it say definitely whether its

an application for a renovation addition, for an amendment, or for a new construction. In one

form it states as a amendment however, the approving documents show that

it is a new construction (Public health Inspectors Report) 5R8. The way the application has

been filled it is safe to come to the conclusion that the said application is not a complete

application that can be approved.

As submitted by the Respondents we find that in annexure 1 of 5R6 describing the present

building, the applicant to the said application states that it has 2 stories. This is contradicted by

the Grama Sevaka Report (5R5B). As to the present usage of the building the application is

silent. It was common ground that these applications are processed after the technical officer

and other field officers inspect these premises and submit their reports before the approvals are

granted. Therefore, when insufficient particulars are submitted or false particulars are

submitted Respondents cannot subsequently plead that they have approved plans only based

on the contents of the application. It is their duty to ascertain and verify the information before

approval is granted. In this instance, the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents had gone the extra mile and

varied all the requirements stipulated under the building regulations to accommodate the

construction. Considering the material submitted before this Court in our view, the objection

of the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents raised based on the GCHQ case has to fail.

Writ of Mandamus

As discussed above in this judgment the 4th,5th & 6th Respondents have acted in violation of

the regulations in granting the approval for the purported development of lot 78 and 80. We

have also considered the photographic evidence submitted. The 1st to 3rd Respondents filed

their Written submissions dated 11.11.2022 which we have considered. In the said Written

Submission the Respondents had invited this Court to consider the fact that the UDA

regulations confer and appreciate a degree of discretion to the planning committee to grant

approvals depending on facts and circumstances on a particular case. However, the said

discretion cannot be an unfretted discretion it has to be used in a justifiable manner, and also

21

the said discretion cannot completely disregard the intention of the drafters of the regulation.

In this instance, we find 4th,5th & 6th Respondents have failed to demonstrate their actions to

justify the deviations allowed from the prescribed regulation. they have failed to submit good

reasons to justify the deviations. In our view, the said Respondents have failed to justify any

of the deviations they have permitted pertaining to the application of the Building Regulations,

further they have failed to demonstrate that the variations that have been allowed are in

compliance with the limited variances afforded under the regulations.

1 3 Respondents also submitted that while this case was pending, they had conducted a site

inspection and had found that the construction that is completed had even violated the

approvals that were granted deviating from the applicable regulations for the benefit of the

developer. However, it is up to the said Respondents to take appropriate action if there is a

violation of the approvals granted according to the law. keep it as it may this Court observes

that since this Court has considered the original granting of the approval by the 4th,5th & 6th

Respondents to be illegal and ultravires of the powers vested with them the said approval is

devoid of any legality.

In the case of Surveyors of Sri Lanka Vs. Acting Surveyor General 1998 1 SLR 266 it was

held as follows;

An administrative act or order which is ultra vires or outside the jurisdiction is void in law,

ie., deprived of legal effect. This is because an order to be valid it (sic) needs statutory

authorization, and if it is not within the powers given by the Act, it has no leg to stand on.

Considering all the materials that have been submitted to this Court we are of the view that the

petitioner has satisfied this Court to obtain the reliefs pleaded.

Accordingly, for the aforesaid reasons, we issue a writ of certiorari as prayed for in prayer (b)

and we also issue a writ of mandamus as per payer (d). Parties to bear their own expenses.
