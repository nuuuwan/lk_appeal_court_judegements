MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant matter has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect namely

Madampitiyage Camil Nishantha under provisions of the Assistances to

and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witness Act, No. 04 of 2015.

The facts relating to the instant matter is that one Kavindya Nilusha

Lakshan has made a complaint against the suspect for allegedly scolding

in filth and threatening her to withdraw the complaint she had made

against her son for sharing nude photographs of the complainant with

some others. The said complaint had been made on 06.02.2020.

Thereafter the suspect had threatened another relative of the

complainant. Based on this complaint the police had reported facts to

the Magistrate under the Provisions of the above mentioned Act and

the suspects had been in remand since March 2022.

The main contention of the Counsel for the suspect is that the suspect is

in remand without any legal action being taken against him.

The State Counsel appearing for the Respondents objected to the

application on the basis that there are no exceptional circumstances

cited by the Counsel for the suspect and further submitted that the

investigations are concluded and that it will be considered by the

Attorney General without delay.

But the Counsel for the suspect stated that there is no definite timeline

cited by the authorities for the consideration of the facts against the

suspect and that itself is an exceptional ground.

According to the law pertaining to the instant matter a suspect

produced under the Provisions of the above Act can be enlarged on bail

only upon exceptional grounds by the Court of Appeal.

But in the instant matter as stated by the State counsel there is no

exceptional grounds cited by the Counsel for the suspect and the

ground cited by the Counsel for the suspect we are unable to consider

as exceptional because the timeline involved is not an inordinate or

exceptional delay. As such this Court sees no reason to enlarge the

suspect on bail. Hence the instant application for bail is refused.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
