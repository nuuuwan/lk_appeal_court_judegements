B. Sasi Mahendran, J.

This is an application for Writs of Certiorari to quash the Orders made by the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal dated 11th March 2019 (P3), the National Police

Commission dated 29th September 2017, and the Disciplinary Order dated 14th January

2014 (on page 10 of the application) all of which found the Petitioner guilty of five

disciplinary charges and thereby dismissed the Petitioner from the Police force. The

Petitioner is also seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing that he be acquitted of all charges

and reinstated in service from the effective date of his dismissal.

The Petitioner joined the Police force on 2nd May 1989 as a Police Constable and

thereafter rose to the rank of Sergeant on 1st January 2003. Following a formal inquiry,

he was dismissed from service with effect from 14th July 2011 by the impugned

Disciplinary Order issued under the hand of the Inspector General of Police. The incident

that led to the Petitioners dismissal was his arrest on 14th July 2011 for allegedly

transporting timber without a permit. He, along with three other Defendants (one of

whom pleaded guilty), was charged under Section 25(2) of the Forest Ordinance in the

Magistrates Court of Manampitiya. He was ultimately acquitted on 31st October 2016.

Initially, a preliminary investigation was held and then a formal inquiry was

conducted by an Assistant Superintendent of Police after the Petitioner was served with

a Charge-Sheet (dated 6th April 2012) containing five charges. These charges included

discreditable conduct, disobedience to orders, neglect of duty, falsehood or

prevarification, and corrupt practices, respectively, in violation or contravention of

Section 1 of Appendix B, Section 3 of Appendix B, Section 4(c) of Appendix B, Section 5(b)

of Appendix B and Section 7(e) of Appendix B of Police Departmental Orders (vide pages

Page 6 of 8

6 -9 of the application). The Petitioner pleaded not guilty. At the inquiry, sixteen witnesses

gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution. The Petitioner neither lead evidence himself

nor called any witnesses. On the recommendation of the inquiring officer (pages 27-39 of

the application), and the evidence led at the inquiry, the Inspector General of Police found

the Petitioner guilty of all charges and dismissed him from service with effect from 14th

July 2011. The relevant part of his Disciplinary Order reads:

, ,

wOHkh

m;%fha .

He appealed the decision to the Public Service Commission, which referred it to

the then-newly re-constituted National Police Commission. It rejected the appeal. This

was appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Petitioner claimed in appeal,

and claims in the present application, that his request for an outside party to conduct the

disciplinary inquiry was denied. He denied being in the lorry at the time he was arrested.

The Petitioner also pleaded that in the light of the Order of acquittal made by the learned

Magistrate dated 31st October 2016 (pages 14 -18 of the application) that there was no

case against him. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal dismissed the appeal (P3).

Aggrieved by the Order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (P3), the

Petitioner is now before this Court. He seeks to impugn that Order on the basis that the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not consider the fact that his request for an outside

party to conduct the disciplinary inquiry was denied and that the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal did not consider the contradictory evidence surrounding his arrest. This Order,

as alleged by the Petitioner, frustrated his legitimate expectations and is unreasonable.

On a perusal of the Order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Tribunal

has observed that the witnesses had confirmed that the Petitioner was in the vehicle at

the time of arrest and that there was no permit to transport timber, and on this basis

found that there was no merit to the appeal. Further, the Tribunal observed that the

Petitioner had been acquitted from a criminal case due to certain contradictions as to the

time and manner of arrest, and the difference of statements on the material apprehended.

However, it concluded that the acquittal was due to the higher standard of proof in a

criminal case, which was not the same standard to prove disciplinary charges framed in

the charge sheet. There was, in their opinion, sufficient proof on a balance of

probabilities.

We are of the view that there is no merit to the present application. This is

primarily because the Petitioner has not proffered any reason as to what he was doing at

the relevant time or what his involvement was in this whole saga. We do not wish to

speculate what the reason may have been, although his involvement continues to be

shrouded in secrecy. When that is the case, it only adds to the speculation. Nevertheless,

the Petitioner had opted not to explain this at the disciplinary inquiry. It was only before

the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and now before this Court that he claims that he

had not been in the lorry when he was arrested (vide paragraph 7(e) of the Petition).

There is no denying that he was arrested. The acquittal as identified by the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal appears to be based on the contradictions in the witness

testimonies, especially in relation to the place and manner of the arrest. There was

nothing to suggest that the Petitioner was wrongly arrested or that he was not at the

scene. It is not for this Court sitting in judicial review to assess such evidence and to

examine the correctness of the decision as that is an exercise for a Court exercising its

appellate jurisdiction. This Court exercising review must examine the lawfulness of the

order of the Tribunal on the grounds of judicial review, none of which have been made out

in the instant application.

The fact of the matter is the Petitioner has tarnished the good repute and

unimpeachable conduct that is expected of a Police Officer because of his dealing. An

opportunity to defend himself and explain matters that were known only to him was not

taken advantage of and it is not possible now for this Court to undertake an appellate

exercise. We are reminded of the proverb, Caesars wife must be above suspicion. It is

conduct such as that which the Petitioner is accused of which brings the entire police force

into disrepute. It is conduct unbecoming of an officer expected to enforce the law.

Further, his allegation that his request for an outsider to conduct the disciplinary

inquiry was denied, and that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal did not consider it, is

without merit. This is because there is no material to substantiate his position that he did

make such a request at the initial inquiry itself.

In Dharmasena v. Shanker [2006] 3 SLR 169, his Lordship Sriskandarajah J. in

response to the Petitioners submission that the inquirer was biased observed on page

171: without raising this objection before the inquirer the Petitioner cannot raise this objection

in this Court for the first time.

Page 8 of 8

Her Ladyship Shiranee Tilakawardane J. in Rajakaruna v. University of Ruhuna

[2004] 3 SLR 141 at page 143 observed:

As to the question of whether the Petitioners were entitled to a legitimate expectation that their

requests sought, for the postponement of the inquiry, would be granted, but the Petitioners have

failed to submit those written requests nor any materials to support their contention that they

acted in accord with the request made by them.

For the aforesaid reasons, we are of the view that this application must be

dismissed without costs.
