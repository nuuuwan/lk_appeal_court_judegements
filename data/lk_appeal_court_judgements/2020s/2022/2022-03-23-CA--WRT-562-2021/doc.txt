Respondents Before : Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

Counsel : Chamara Nanayakkarawasam for the Petitioner.

Hasini Opatha, SC for the Respondents.

Supported on : 21.02.2022

Written submissions: tendered on behalf of Petitioner: 11.03.2022

Decided on : 23.03.2022

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner is a final year student of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of

the 1st Respondent University of Ruhuna (University). The Petitioner claims that he was

a prominent student activist who did not scummed to the pressure of the Respondents,

particularly of the 2nd to 4th Respondents who allegedly suppressed the democratic student

activities. The Petitioner states that he is the President of the de-facto Main Union of the

Students Unions of the University.

The Petitioners studentship has been suspended by a letter dated 15.10.2021, marked P4,

after revealing the fact that the Petitioner has posted a chat message (through zoom)

insulting the 2nd Respondent Vice Chancellor of the University (Vice Chancellor) and the

3rd Respondent Deputy Vice Chancellor at the live launching ceremony of the updated

website of the faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University. In response to

the said decision (P4) of the Vice Chancellor, the Petitioner has written a letter dated

24.10.2021, marked P5 denying all allegations. The Vice Chancellor by his letter dated

27.10.2021, marked P6 confirming the decision taken in P4 has reminded the Petitioner

that he had been advised even on a previous occasion not to engage in activities defaming

the University.

Page 5 of 11

The Petitioner in this application is seeking for an order in the nature of a writ of Certiorari

quashing the said decision reflects in P4 and the decision contained in P6. A writ of

Mandamus is also being sought directing the 1st to 33rd Respondents to allow the Petitioner

to participate at his examinations and academic activities pertaining to the Bachelor of

Arts in Political Science (Special) Degree subjected to any disciplinary inquiry.

After filing this application in this Court, a report dated 13.01.2021, marked 2R1 has

been submitted to the Vice Chancellor by the Investigations Committee consisting of three

Professors who conducted the preliminary investigations upon the allegations against the

Petitioner. As a result, the Council of the University, based on the recommendations made

in the said report, decided and approved to issue a charge sheet against the Petitioner and

such charges can be summarized as follows;

i. Petitioner has committed an offence violating disciplinary rules and laws by

publishing a defamatory chat comment against the Vice Chancellor and the

Deputy Vice Chancellor of the University at the live launching ceremony of the

updated website of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ruhunu

University by participating under the login ID named as Mudalige

ii. Petitioner has committed an offence by defaming the Vice Chancellor and the

Deputy Vice Chancellor by publishing a defamatory chat comment mentioned in

the first charge

iii. Petitioner has committed an offence by bringing the Faculty of Humanities and

Social Sciences and its entire student population in to disrepute

In view of the above factual matrix, the Court need to ascertain whether the Petitioner has

satisfied the initial threshold requirement which warrants this Court to issue formal notice

of this application on the Respondents.

The prayer of the Petition focus only on the documents marked P4 and the P6 by which

the Vice Chancellor has suspended the studentship of the Petitioner. However, the

University has already completed the preliminary investigation against the Petitioner and

the members of the Committee who conducted the preliminary inquiry has recommended

that the above charges be inquired at a formal disciplinary inquiry. By virtue of the decision

taken by the Council of the University which reflects in the document dated 28.02.2022

marked R4, a formal disciplinary inquiry is supposed to be held against the Petitioner in

due course. Accordingly, no decision has been taken to expel the Petitioner from the

Page 6 of 11

University other than the decision to suspend his studentship subjected to a formal

disciplinary inquiry.

The Petitioner has not taken steps to amend the pleadings in order to challenge the report

of the preliminary investigation committee (2R1). The grievance of the Petitioner at this

juncture is that he would not be able to sit at the forthcoming examinations due to the said

suspension and accordingly, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner moved that the

suspension order reflected in letter marked P4 be quashed subject to any decision of the

formal disciplinary inquiry.

The Petitioner submits that the decision contained in the said letter marked P4 is ultra

vires as much as the Petitioner was not given any form of hearing prior to the said decision

and also that the said decision is disproportionate and harsh. When a disciplinary action

is contemplated against any student, the University authorities may conduct a preliminary

investigation and if a prima facie case against such student is disclosed, a formal charge

sheet can be issued on the student. The student will eventually get an opportunity to submit

his detailed explanations to such charges. Anyhow the letter dated 24.10.2021 marked P5

can be considered as a primary explanation given by the Petitioner after the suspension of

his studentship.

The following passage in the Article titled, "Scholars, Students and Sanctions - Dismissal

and Discipline in the Modern University" written by Michael J. Beloff Q.C., who has

fascinatingly described the Natural Justice as a bed of Procrustes, in Denning Law Journal,

(Vol. 13 No. 1 (1998)) caught my eye;

Willis J 1. said: "In my view, the audi alteram partem rule was complied with on the facts

of this case by the defendant being allowed to make written representations for the board's

consideration: ... it seems to me, on the facts, first that the defendant knew precisely the nature

of the complaints which were made about him; secondly, that he was given an opportunity to

state his case; and thirdly, that the tribunal acted in good faith. In those circumstances, it

seems to me - on those three findings - that it is conclusive that there was no breach of the rules

of natural justice in the defendant's exclusion from an oral hearing by the board. On the

contrary he was, I think, treated with complete fairness throughout

I am of the view that the Petitioner has already been afforded a fair opportunity on

28.12.2021 to make an oral statement at the preliminary investigation apart from his

1 Brighton Corporation vs. Parry (1972) 70 L.G.R. 576

Page 7 of 11

written explanation given in the letter marked P5. Further, it is pertinent to note that

though, the Petitioner has averred malice there is no specific or direct evidence in the

pleadings to sustain the plea of mala fide since the Court would not in general entertain

allegations of bad faith against the repository of a power, unless bad faith has been

expressly pleaded and properly enumerated in detail. (See - Bandaranayke vs. Judicial

Service Commission (2003) 3 SLR 101, Gunasinghe vs. Hon. Gamini Dissanayake

(1994) 2 SLR 132)

Apart from the assertions on not granting a hearing, the other point contended by the

Petitioner is that in terms of by-laws approved by the Council of the University marked

2R3 (by-laws), the Vice Chancellor could suspend a student from attending lectures,

courses or any other course of study at the University only for a period not exceeding two

weeks. As opposed to that, the Respondents argue that in terms of clause 36 of the said

by-laws, the Vice Chancellor has the authority and power to take appropriate actions in

contrary to those by-laws and provisions if the Vice Chancellor thinks it is necessary to

maintain discipline at the University.

Now it is needed to examine whether the nature of the charges levelled against the

Petitioner entails a serious breakdown of discipline in the University upon which the Vice

Chancellor could exercise his powers under clause 36 of the said by-laws.

I draw my attention to the statement given by the 2nd Respondent Vice Chancellor on

11.11.2021 at the preliminary investigations (annexure 1 to 2R1) by which the Vice

Chancellor has submitted that the following wordings had been exhibited on the chat box

by way of a post originated under the name Mudalige immediately before the Vice

Chancellor commenced his speech.

.

.

.

.

The above statement has been made in reference to Saman Chandana and Sujeewa

Amarasena who are the Deputy Vice Chancellor and the Vice Chancellor respectively. It

has been divulged at the preliminary investigations that the Petitioner has logged in to the

Page 8 of 11

relevant zoom meeting through a single IP address intermittently, under the ID named as

Prasanna Bandara as well as under an ID named as Mudalige. The Committee who

conducted the preliminary inquiry has arrived at that conclusion based on the evidence,

among other, shown in annexure 9 to 2R1. Hence, the said committee has decided that

the Petitioner is prima facie liable for the defamatory and abusive words published against

the Vice Chancellor and the Deputy Vice Chancellor through Zoom. The said decision

has been taken based on the evidence made available at the said investigation.

The section 34(6) (b) of the Universities Act declares that a Vice Chancellor of a University

shall be responsible for the maintenance of discipline within the University. The discipline

is paramount in any educational institute and it is a duty of all stakeholders to safeguard

the rights of the students who are eagerly awaiting to step into the next slab in their career

path. It is to be observed that the law tends to protect the reputation of a person and not

the character of a person. The defamation is being considered even as a delictual offence.

The frequent definition to a libel is a malicious defamation expressed by writing, printing

and by signs or pictures.

In that context, its my view that committing an offence by defaming or abusing such

disciplinary authority of a higher Educational Institution, in public, is a significant threat

to the peace and harmony between the students and the authorities and also a serious

breakdown of discipline. The criminal offences such as assault, sexual harassment and

ragging which causes physical and mental injury are also in the same cluster of

misbehavior creating serious breakdown of discipline. In a judicial review application this

Court, in my view, can take in to account those ideologies to assess any purported

malfunctioning of rule of natural justice in the process of taking decisions to maintain the

high standards of discipline within a University.

His Lordship Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz in agreement with me has held in Y.P.K. I.

Ranasinghe vs. South Eastern University of Sri Lanka and others

(CA/Writ/258/2019, decided on 24.09.2020) as follows;

Even though rules of natural justice are indispensable adjuncts to due process, it would

appear that even rules of natural justice have no application in situations where it is manifest

upon perusal of such evidence as in the case, that it is the very conduct of the Petitioner that

has caused the consequences in the matter.

Page 9 of 11

His Lordship Justice Nawaz further drawing his attention to the jurisprudence that was

enunciated in the case of Glynn vs. Keele University (1971) 2 All ER 89 has observed

that the court had taken the view that in the case of a student who is found to be in flagrant

violation of discipline in campus, it would be useless formality if rules of natural justice

were to be insisted upon, where facts are quite clear an unambiguous as to the guilt of the

person charged.

Shiranee Tilakawardane J. also has taken a similar view in Rajakaruna and Others vs

University of Ruhuna and Others (2004) 3 Sri. LR 141 where she has held that, a matter

of discipline, unless it is patently capricious would be a matter that is wholly within the

purview and control of the University. Tilakawardane J. has further observed as follows;

When deciding whether there was a violation of rules of natural justice by the Respondents

it has to be emphasized that there are no strict standards and it depends on the circumstances

of each case. Though in general courts have held that academic disciplinary proceedings

require observance of principles of natural justice there are exceptions to this norm

Lord Denning M.R. in Hoffman-La Roch vs. Secretary of State for Trade and

Industry (1975) AC-295 (at p. 320) states A failure to observe the rules of natural justice

does not render a decision or order or report absolutely void in the sense that it is a

nullity.if his (his is referred to the offender in that case by Lord Denning)

conduct has been disgraceful and he has in fact suffered no injustice, he may be refused relief.

see Glynn V. Keele University [1971] 1 W.L.R. 487 and Ward v. Bradford Corpn. (1971)

70 L.G.R. 27 (Emphasis added)

In view of the foregoing, I hold that the charges against the Petitioner amounts to a serious

breakdown of discipline in the University upon which the Vice Chancellor is entitled to

exercise his authority under clause 36 of the by-laws marked 2R3. Thus, based on the

circumstances of this case, I am not inclined to accept the proposition advanced by the

Petitioner that the authorities of the University are empowered only to suspend a student

only for two weeks.

In spite of all above it is necessary to bear in mind that the Judicial review such as an

application for writ of certiorari to quash a decision, the reviewing Court will eventually

scrutinize the decision-making process. In the instant application, the authorities have now

gone ahead beyond the impugned decision to suspend the studentship and have taken

Page 10 of 11

afresh decision to conduct a formal disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner which is yet

to be concluded.

I am acutely aware that the order of this application may decide the fate of a university

student and therefore, I need to extend my examination by taking in to account all possible

aspects relevant to the questions of this application. In light of that I am reminded of the

ancient kingdom of Vajjian (in India) which was fully enriched with principles of good

governance in their administration. K.N. Jayatilleke in Dhamma Man And Law

(published by Buddhist Cultural Center, Sri Lanka, 2000 at p. 81) has referred to the

commentary to Vajjian Constitution which is to my mind deliberates astonishingly an

inquiry process until the accused is being punished. The said commentary reads;

As for the ancient Vajjian constitution it is said that when a thief was brough before the

ancient Vajjian rulers, they handed him over to the judicial officers (vinicchaya-mahamatta).

They investigated the facts and if they thought that he was not a thief they released him but

if they suspected that he was a thief, they handed him over to the magistrates (voharika)

without making any statement themselves. They in turn investigated matters and if they

thought he was not a thief they released him but if they suspected that he was a thief they

made him over to the justices (sutta-dhara)they in turn to a panel of eight judges (attha-

kulika)they in turn to the president, who investigated the case and if he thought that he

was not a thief, released him but if he was convinced that the was a thief called for the book

of precedents (paveni-potthaka). There it is written down that such and such was punishment

for such and such an offence. The president, thereupon compared his offence with those and

ordered the appropriate punishment. Thus, the people who abided by the ancient Vajjian

constitution had no grouse (against the state) because justice was done in accordance with the

ancient tradition and they felt that if anyone was at fault it was themselves and not the

officials (of the state). And as a result, they performed their tasks with a sense of responsibility.

In this way the state prospered2.

Therefore, I take the view that the Petitioner also should be subjected to a process as

explained above as there are allegations on his behaviour that gravely violates the

sentiment or accepted standard of the community.

In this backdrop I need to emphasize that all allegations against the Petitioner are yet to

be fully assayed at the formal disciplinary inquiry and still he has the opportunity to

2 Sumangala Vilasini, 11, P.T.S., p. 519

Page 11 of 11

challenge the decision-making process of such formal inquiry. Moreover, this Court makes

the observation that the members of the Committee appointed to hold the formal

disciplinary inquiry should conclude the inquiry expeditiously following the due process.

In the circumstances, I am convinced that the allegations against the Petitioners are yet to

be inquired in to at the formal disciplinary inquiry and the alleged conduct of the Petitioner

is, prima facie, a flagrant violation of discipline in the University which disturbs the

smooth administration of the authorities for the benefit of majority of students. Therefore,

I am of the view that the Petitioner has no lawful ground at this stage to maintain this

application and also to seek any discretionary relief from this Court. Hence, I proceed to

refuse this application.
