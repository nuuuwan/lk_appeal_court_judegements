JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing the offence

as mentioned below.

The Appellant was indicted along with another named Saranga Pradeep

Fernando for committing murder and robbery with a common intention for

causing death and robbery of one Thelge Sumith Peiris on 04/05/2006.

Trial proceeded against the Appellant only as the 1st accused had died before

the commencement of the trial. As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial,

the trial commenced before a judge and the prosecution had led twelve

witnesses and marked production P1-13 and X and closed the case. The

Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that evidence presented by the

prosecution warranted a case to answer, called for the defence and explained

the rights of the accused. Having selected the right to make a statement from

the dock, the Appellant had proceeded to deny the charge.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellant as

charged and sentenced him to death on 02/08/2016.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid 19

pandemic. At the hearing the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

3 | P a g e

The Counsel for the Appellant has raised only one ground of appeal and

argued under nine sub headings mentioned below.

The Conviction of the Appellant is wholly unsafe for the following reasons,

namely;

a) Conviction is wholly based on the uncorroborated evidence of a sole

child eye witness.

b) No police statement was given by the sole eye witness.

c) Contradictory reasons were adduced by the eye witness and his

mother for the failure in making a police complaint.

d) Statement of the eye witness did not lead to the arrest of the accused.

e) Version of the eye witness does not favour the test of probability.

f) Version of the eye witness is contradicted by PW1.

g) Trial court failed to assess the testimonial trustworthiness of the eye

witness.

h) Learned Judge was deprived of observing the demeanour and

deportment of the sole eye witness.

i) Identification parade was held after nearly a month from the date of

the incident. No specific feature of the accused being mentioned by the

eye witness.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

The eye witness PW2 was 11 years old when the incident had occurred. He

is a relation of the deceased-accused. After school he was employed at a wood

workshop. According to the eye witness, who was 17 years of age at the time

of giving evidence before the High Court, when he was walking down near

his home on the date of the incident, the deceased-accused who is a relation

of this witness asked him to stop to buy cigarettes for him. The Appellant

also was there at that time. After some time, the deceased had come along

the road on a motor bike. The deceased-accused stopped him and dealt a

4 | P a g e

blow on his head with a club. Immediately, the Appellant had stabbed the

deceased with a knife. The deceased had pleaded not to assault him at that

time. Seeing this gruesome incident, the witness had run home and divulged

the incident to his mother. Fearing reprisal from the offenders his mother

PW10 had sent her eye witness son to her home town fearing his safety.

Hence, this witness could not give a statement to the police. Later, he gave

evidence at the inquest and identified the Appellant at the identification

parade held on 02/06/2006.

PW10 also gave evidence and corroborated what her eye witness son had told

her on that day and what she did thereafter.

According to PW18 the investigator of this case, he had received the first

information about the death of the deceased from PW3 Asitha Fernando.

Upon further investigation he had received information about the offenders

from PW10 who is the mother of the eye witness. However, she did not

produce her son to the police due to fear of his life. The eye witness had given

evidence at the inquest held in the Magistrate Court directly.

Under the appeal ground stated above, the Counsel for the Appellant

contends that as the conviction is wholly based on the uncorroborated

evidence of a sole child eye witness the conviction is wholly unsafe.

In The Attorney General v. Devunderage Nihal SC/Appeal/145/2010

decided on 03/01/2019 Aluvihare, J. had held that:

a) An accused can be convicted on a single witness in a prosecution

based on a police detection, if the judge forms the view that the

evidence of such witness can, with caution, be relied upon, after

probing the testimony.

b) Corroboration is not sine qua non for a conviction in a police

detection case, if the judge, after probing, is of the opinion that the

witness is credible and the evidence can be acted upon without

hesitation.

5 | P a g e

E.R.S.R Coomaraswami in his treatise Law of Evidence Vol 2 book 2 at

page 658 has stated as follows referring to child witnesses:

There is no requirement in English Law, that the sworn evidence of a

child witness needs to be corroborated as matter of law. But the jury

should be warned, not to look for corroboration, but of the risk

involved in acting on the sole evidence of young girls or boys, though

they may do so if convinced of the truth of such evidence.. This

requirement is based on the susceptibility of children to the influence

of others and to the surrender to their imagination.

At page 659 it states:

As regards the sworn testimony of children, there is no requirement

as in England to warn of the risks involved in acting on their sole

testimony, though it may be desirable to issue such a warning, though

the failure to do so will generally not affect the conviction.

Although the Learned Trial Judge had not considered Section 134 of the

Evidence Ordinance, he had assessed the evidence given by PW2 and his

mother PW10 in its correct perspective. The eye witnesss evidence very well

tallied with the medical evidence especially, with regard to the injuries

sustained by the deceased and coming to the conclusion that the prosecution

had presented trustworthy, cogent and impressive evidence has not

occasioned any failure of justice in this case.

Further, the Counsel for the Appellant argued that the no police statement

was given by the sole eye witness and contradictory reasons were adduced

by the eye witness and his mother for the failure in making a police

complaint.

As mentioned above, the eye witness was evacuated to his mothers home

town for his safely immediately after the incident. Hence no prompt

statement was not recorded. But on 08/05/2006 the eye witness PW2 had

given a very comprehensive statement at the inquest. The eye witness had

6 | P a g e

very clearly mentioned that he had seen the Appellant with the deceased

accused previously and therefore he could identify him if he sees him again.

During the High Court trial, the defence was issued with a copy of the

statement the witness made during the inquest proceedings.

Section 110(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 states

thus;

Any police officer or inquirer making an investigation under this

chapter may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted

with the facts and circumstances of the case, and shall reduce into

writing any statement made by the person so examined, but any oaths

or affirmation shall not be administer to any such person..

In this case, the eye witness had immediately divulged this incident to his

mother. Fearing his safety, she had sent him away to her home town. Hence

the police could not record his statement. But on 08/05/2006, four days

after the incident he had given a statement before the inquest proceeding. At

the High Court trial, the said statement was made available to the defence

and the eye witness was subjected to lengthy cross-examination. Although

three contradictions were marked on the statement made at the inquest by

the eye witness, the Learned High Court Judge had very correctly declared

that contradictions would not have any bearing on PW2s evidence.

When the eye witness PW2 had given cogent evidence against the Appellant,

the mere fact that the statement of PW2 was not taken down in writing is not

a fatal procedural irregularity as argued by the Counsel for the Appellant.

Nowhere in the proceedings the eye witness and his mother had given

contradictory reasons for failure to give a police statement by the eye witness.

In addition, the Counsel for the Appellant contends that the statement of the

eye witness did not lead to the arrest of the accused.

7 | P a g e

The position of the eye witness was that immediately after the incident, he

had disclosed the incident to her mother, PW10 and thereafter he was

evacuated to her mothers village for his safety.

According to PW18 CI/Kodithuwakku, who had conducted the investigation

into the death of the deceased confirmed that he received information about

the perpetrators of this crime from PW10, the mother of the eye witness.

PW10 also admitted that she made her statement to the police two days after

the incident.

According to Section 109 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of

1979, every information relating to the commission of an offence may be

given orally or in writing to a police officer or inquirer. In this case, the

mother of the eye witness had given information about the commission of

the murder by the Appellant. She had received this information from the eye

witness who is her son. Both had given evidence and corroborated this fact

during the trial. The police had commenced investigation upon the

information passed by PW10. Hence it is incorrect to say that eye witnesses

evidence did not lead to the arrest of the Appellant. Further this has not

caused any prejudice to the Appellant.

In addition, the Counsel for the Appellant argued that the version of the eye

witness does not favour the test of probability and his version is contradicted

by PW1. She further argued that the trial court failed to assess the

testimonial trustworthiness of the eye witness.

The eye witness was 11 years old when he witnessed the gruesome incident

pertaining to this case. But his evidence was not contradicted on material

particulars. His evidence pertaining to stabbing and assault with a club is

very well corroborated by the medical evidence.

PW1 is the wife of the deceased who had only come to the place of incident

after hearing the cries that her husband had been beaten by some body.

When she went there had seen her deceased husband was lying on the

8 | P a g e

ground. She had not seen anything else. Hence it is incorrect to say that the

evidence of the eye witness had been contradicted by the evidence of PW1.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgement had considered the

probability factors of this case very extensively. Further, he had analysed the

eye witnesss evidence in its correct perspective and correctly believed and

satisfied his evidence to come to his decision.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant also argued that the Learned Judge

was deprived of observing the demeanour and deportment of the sole eye

witness.

It is correct that the evidence of the eye witness was led before his

predecessor of the learned judge who wrote the judgment. The Learned High

Court Judge who wrote the judgment had properly adopted the evidence led

up to that point with the consent of both parties on 08/02/2016.There had

been no application by the defence to re-call PW2 in terms of Section 48 of

the Judicature Act. Once the proceedings are adopted and continued, the

deprivation of observing the demeanour and deportment cannot be taken as

an appeal ground. Further, the Learned Trial Judge who wrote the judgment

had very correctly considered the evidence of eye witness with utmost care

and caution. He had reasoned for the acceptance of his evidence as reliable

and trustworthy. Hence, even though the Learned Judge who wrote the

judgment did not have the benefit of observing the demeanour and

deportment of the eye witness, he had very extensively considered his

evidence without causing any prejudice to the Appellant.

Finally, the Counsel for the Appellant had contended that as the

identification parade was held after nearly a month from the date of the

incident and no specific feature of the accused being mentioned by the eye

witness, the acceptance of the identification parade notes creates a

reasonable doubt about the identity of the Appellant.

9 | P a g e

It was the position of the eye witness that he had witnessed the incident very

clearly with the available light on that date. Immediately he had informed

the incident to his mother. He had also stated that he had no difficulty in

identifying the Appellant at the identification parade. At the trial, he had

identified the Appellant in open court.

In the cross examination, the eye witness had reiterated that he saw the

Appellant 15-20 minutes prior to the incident. As the deceased-accused

asked him to wait, he had waited there till the occurrence of the incident.

According to eye witness, he has not faced any difficult circumstances when

he witnessed the incident and identified the Appellant.

As this is not a case of fleeting glance identification following principles

enunciated in Turnbull case is not necessary. The Learned High Court

Judge had accurately discussed the circumstances upon which PW2 had

identified the Appellant. He had very correctly disregarded the contradictions

marked on the evidence given by PW2, stating that the said contradictions

are not forceful enough to create a doubt about the identity of the Appellant

Hence no substantial miscarriage of justice had occurred to the Appellant.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment very extensively analysed the

evidence of PW2 who is the sole eye witness in this case. Eye witness had no

connection whatsoever with the Appellant up to the time of the incident. This

witness had clearly witnessed the attack carried on the deceased by the

Appellant using a knife. He had witnessed the incident from close proximity

in a condition of good lighting.

The incident happened on 04/05/2006 and the eye witness gave evidence in

the High Court on 11/01//2011 and 27/02/2012 after about 06 years of

the incident. When the incident happened, he was only 11 years of age. As

the memory of a person fades with the lapse of time, recalling each and every

minute detail of a gruesome incident that which happened suddenly and

unexpectedly is humanely impossible. Hence, the argument advanced by the

10 | P a g e

Learned Counsel for the Appellant under appeal ground one is without any

merit.

When the evidence presented against the Appellant is considered, I conclude

that the prosecution had succeeded in adducing highly incriminating

evidence against the Appellant and thereby established the 1st charge beyond

reasonable doubt.

As such, I conclude, that this is not an appropriate case in which to interfere

with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge of Panadura dated

02/08/2016. Hence, I dismiss the Appeal.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Panadura along with the original case record.
