MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect namely

Dambarawe Gedara Sujeewa Premasiri under the provisions of the

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act no

4 of 2015.

The suspect in the instant matter has been indicted for a case of murder

in Matale and the virtual complainant in the instant matter had made

the complaint alleging that the suspect had threatened her. The said

virtual complainant is the daughter of a witness in the murder case, and

the incident had taken place while they were returning from Court.

The Counsel for the suspect stated that the suspect had been in remand

for the instant matter for nearly two years and four months.

The state Counsel appearing for respondents objected to the

application on the basis that he has one pending case and another

previous conviction which had been suspended. But the state counsel

failed to state as to when legal action will be considered against the

suspect, she in fact stated that the police have failed to submit the IB

extracts although several reminders have been sent which indicates the

lopsided attitude of the law enforcing authorities.

The law pertaining to the instant matter is that when a suspect is

produced under the provisions of the above act bail can be considered

only upon exceptional circumstances by the Court of Appeal. The term

exceptional has not been defined in the statute, but in many of our

decided cases it has been held that exceptionality defers from case to

Page 4 of 4

case. The exceptionality pleaded by the Counsel in the instant matter is

the long period of remand without any action being taken against or for

the suspect by the respondents.

It is observed by this Court that the objective of the instant act is to safe

guard the rights of the victims and the witnesses but at the same time

it has been stated by the act that matters coming under this act must

be given precedence over other matters to ensure speedy disposal of

the matters. But in the instant matter we do not see any such thing

being considered but instead what we see is that the matter is being

dragged on for no good reason.

As such we consider this case to be a fit matter to be considered for the

granting of bail.

As such the instant application for bail is allowed and we direct the

relevant Magistrate to enlarge the above named suspect on suitable

conditions of bail without delay upon the receipt of this order.

We direct the Registrar of this Court to convey the instant order to the

relevant Magistrates Court.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
