Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

A jurisdictional question has been raised by the 1st to 7th and 9th Respondents (Respondents)

by way of a preliminary objection. The Respondents contend that the Article 61A of the

Constitution precludes the jurisdiction, under Article 140 of the Constitution, exercised by

this Court in the instant application The Article 61A of the Constitution;

Subject to the provisions of Article 59 and of Article 126, no court or tribunal shall

have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call

in question any order or decision made by the Commission, a Committee, or any

public officer, in pursuance of any power or duty conferred or imposed on such

Commission, or delegated to a Committee or public officer, under this Chapter or

under any other law.

The Respondents relying on the judgements of Amarasekara vs. Kodituwakku (2005) 1 Sri. L.R.

58; Jayantha Kumara and another vs. Thilak Collure and others, CA/Writ/362/2009; Jayaweera

vs. Commissioner of Agrarian Services (1996) 2 Sri. L.R. 70; Pradeshiya Sabhawa, Hingurakgoda

and others vs. Karunaratna and others (2006) 2 Sri. L.R. 410 submit that the Petitioner is not

entitled to seek a writ of Mandamus with regard to any aspect of an appointment without first

challenging the decision of the Public Service Commission (PSC). Without any

equivocation, I concur with the precedent enunciated in the above judgements. Hence, it is

necessary to examine whether this Court could proceed to consider the reliefs prayed for by

the Petitioner without first being inquired into or pronounced upon or called in question the

alleged decision of the PSC.

The Respondents above objection is mainly based on the reliefs sought by the Petitioner in

paragraph (D) of the prayer of the Petition by which the Petitioner is seeking for a writ of

Mandamus compelling the 1st, 3rd and 5th Respondents to appoint the Petitioner as a

Consultant to the Neonatology Unit of the Teaching Hospital, Kurunegala (Hospital). The

contention of the Respondents is that the appointment of the Petitioner to the post of Resident

Pediatrician at the Hospital is an appointment made by the PSC and as such any adverse

ruling of this Court in respect of the said appointment would amount to calling in question or

pronouncing upon the said decision of the PSC.

As opposed to the Respondents arguments, the Petitioner asserts that no decision of the PSC

is being challenged in the instant application and the decisions impugned in this application

are completely based on the internal arrangements of the Hospital and Article 61A of the

Constitution has no application to this case.

The Petitioner reported to the Hospital on 11.06.2020 to serve as the Resident Pediatrician

after annual transfers 2020 of specialist medical officers were duly effected. The 5th

Respondent Acting Director (for Director) of the Hospital by letter dated 11.07.2020, marked

P12, has informed the Petitioner to engage in affairs in the Neonatal Unit of the Hospital on

exigencies of duty. The 3rd Respondent Director General of Health has authorized the

Director of the Hospital by letter dated 03.02.2021, marked P19, to adopt a suitable internal

mechanism to obtain the services of the Petitioner effectively. The 3rd Respondent has given

such authorization in pursuance to the request made by the Director by P18 to employ the

Page 5 of 8

Petitioner on exigencies of service in the Neonatal Unit of the Hospital. Subsequently, the

Director has assigned the Petitioner to the Neonatal Unit by his letter dated 10.02.2021,

marked P20.

Only at the stage of filing the Statement of Objections, the Respondents took the stance that

the decision of the Director reflected in P12 is ultra vires and further, the Petitioner cannot

place any reliance on the Directors letter, marked P20, on the basis that it has no validity in

law. The Respondents in paragraph 14 of their Statement of Objections categorically admit

the issuance of the letter, marked P19, by the 3rd Respondent but abstain from classifying the

said decision ultra vires.

The Director after issuing the letter, marked P12, has addressed a letter dated 18.07.2020,

marked P14, to the Deputy Director General-Medical Services and has emphasized about

the strong objections raised by 8th Respondent in view of appointing the Petitioner to the post

of Resident Pediatrician at the Hospital. In the same communication, the Director has

requested to abolish the post of Resident Pediatrician. In the letter, marked P19, the 3rd

Respondent has emphatically observed that the Petitioner has opted to be appointed as the

Resident Pediatrician of the Hospital in alignment with the published Annual Specialists

Transfer list and such observations imply that the Petitioner has applied for the said post

merely because it was a post that was available in the said Transfer list.

In this context, it appears that the Petitioner has been appointed to a post which, in the

opinion of the Director and the other Consultant Pediatricians including the 8th Respondent,

is redundant. The Petitioner has applied to the said post as it was a duly created post under

the said Annual Transfer list and the PSC has made the Petitioners appointment after

finalizing all such transfers by the Ministry of Health. It is apparent that the PSC has no

involvement in creating posts, on its own, at any of the hospitals and such posts are usually

created and advertised according to specific requirements which are identified by the health

authorities and not by the PSC.

The Petitioner has come before this Court setting out the difficulties she had to undergo after

appointing her as the Resident Pediatrician of the Hospital. Declaring the decision of the

Director, marked P12, ultra vires by the Respondents and authorizing the Director to resolve

Page 6 of 8

the issues through an internal mechanism by the 3rd Respondent clearly amplifies that there is

an acute need for this Court to examine the vires of the decisions of the Respondents taken

during the preliminary process relating to the specialists transfers. It cannot be assumed in

the pretext of the Constitutional ouster that this Court has no jurisdiction to examine the vires

of such decisions of the Respondents who may have assumed a jurisdiction which they dont

have or exceeded the jurisdiction which they do have.

It emanates from the letters issued by the PSC on 08.03.2021 and 29.09.2021, marked P27

and R9 respectively that the PSC has called for observations from the Ministry of Health

relating to issues similar to the instant application as well. In the letter, marked R9, the PSC

has identified a vital question whether the Petitioner who reported to the Hospital as a result

of annual transfers could be appointed to another vacant post within the same Hospital. The

PSC without arriving at a conclusion primarily has decided to query the 1st Respondent on

the said point.

I take the view that this Court is also ought to examine the same question based on the

circumstances of this case and such examination cannot be subjected to the ouster clause

embodied in Article 61A of the Constitution. In other words, the issue on assigning work in

a different unit in the same hospital on exigencies of services should be taken into

consideration. Additionally, it cannot be assumed that this Court has a jurisdictional bar to

consider the reliefs prayed for in paragraph (E) of the prayer of the Petition. For these reasons,

I hold that the preliminary objection raised by the Respondents has no merits and is untenable

based on the circumstances of the instant Application. Thus, I overrule the jurisdictional

objection and decide to proceed with the hearing of the arguments of both parties.

Having considered the tenability of the jurisdictional objection, now I need to consider the

application for the extension of the interim order which is valid up to the date of this Order.

The said interim order was issued by this Court on 28.06.2021 after hearing the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner as well as for the Respondents and it was not an order made ex

parte. The discretion of the Review Court when issuing an interim order is very wide and the

court in such instances must assess the strength of the case and the balance of convenience.

This Court issued the said interim order based on the material made available to Court as at

the date of support and also exercising prudence, discretion and circumspection.

Page 7 of 8

However, the Respondents in their Statement of Objections put forward a strong claim to get

the interim order varied or refused based on the contents of those pleadings. The Respondents

have taken a radical approach declaring the decision of the said Director to assign the

Petitioner to the Neonatal unit ultra vires and also devaluing the decision of the 3rd

Respondent in P19. I cannot possibly overlook such assertions and when employing the tests

applicable in regard to issuing or extending of interim reliefs, I am convinced that the

assessment on the balance of convenience should be revisited. In the circumstances, I use my

discretion to dissolve the interim relief issued by this Court on 28.06.2021, leaving an

opportunity for the Petitioner to agitate this order (order on the interim relief), if necessary,

in due course with additional and fresh evidence.

But the process adopted by the Respondents to agitate the said interim order especially by

annexing two additional affidavits is unsatisfactory. The R11 and R12 are two affidavits

affirmed by a Consultant Pediatrician and a Consultant Neonatologist. Both of them are

currently serving at Government Hospitals and not parties to this application; or no

application has been made on their behalf for intervention to the instant Application. I am

conscious of the provisions of Chapter XXXIII of the Establishments Code which deals with

legal actions relating to public officers. The Respondents have allegedly annexed those two

affidavits to their Statement of Objections only for the purpose of supporting the matters set

out therein. (vide- paragraph 32 of the statement of objections).

Anyhow, the affirmant of the affidavit, marked R12, making adverse remarks against the

Petitioner in several paragraphs of the affidavit states that it is absolutely paramount that the

Court of Appeal, without delay, varies the interim order and direct the Petitioner be removed

from the Neonatology Unit. I take the view that no person who is not a party to this

application has a legal or moral right whatsoever to influence this Court to vary the said

interim order in the manner that the affidavit has been affirmed. I make a strong observation

that this kind of influence through a Consultant who is not even serving in the Kurunegala

Teaching Hospital may lead to contempt of court as it is the paramount duty of the Hospital

authorities including all the Respondents to obey any order issued by this Court irrespective

of the post held by them or irrespective of their expertise in a particular field of study.

Apart from such observations, I exercise my discretion for the best interest of justice and for

the purpose of examining effectively the questions involved in this application to call from the

Secretary to the Public Service Commission a copy of;

i. the report submitted to PSC in response to letter dated 08.03.2021, marked P27

ii. the letter received by PSC in response to the letter dated 29.09.2021, marked R9

for the inspection and examination by this Court. Thus, the Secretary to the PSC is directed

to tender such documentation to this Court through the Attorney General by way of a motion,

three weeks prior to the next date of this case. The Registrar of this Court is directed to

communicate this order forthwith to the Secretary to the PSC.
