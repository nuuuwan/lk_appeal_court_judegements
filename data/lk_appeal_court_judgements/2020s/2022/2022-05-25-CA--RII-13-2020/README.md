In the instant application, the Defendant-Judgment-Debtor-Respondent-

Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant) seeks, inter alia, this

Courts intervention to exercise its restitutionary and/or revisionary jurisdiction

to set aside and vacate the Order of the learned District Judge of Jaffna dated

15.09.2020 in Case No. L/198/2014 and in the interim for an Order to restrain the

Plaintiff- Judgment-Creditor- Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the Plaintiff) from taking any steps consequent to or under the said Order.

The factual matrix will be dealt with in order to understand the background

of this application.

The Defendant entered into a Lease Agreement with the Plaintiff on

01.09.2007 for a period of three years, at the end of which, it was extended for a

further three-year period. The Defendant (i.e., the lessee of the property

concerned) allegedly breached his obligations under the Lease Agreement by

failing to pay the advance and monthly rents and demolishing the toilet, tank as

well as the boundary wall of the property, without obtaining prior permission.

Following continuous demands for losses to be made good, a letter of demand,

dated 30.05.2013, was sent to the Defendant requiring him to vacate the premises.

Notwithstanding the said letter, the Defendant continued to be in possession. On

20.01.2014, the Plaintiff instituted an action in the District Court of Jaffna against

the Defendant on the basis that he failed to pay rent from 24.05.2012 onwards.

The Defendant in his Answer has taken the position that he constructed a building

with the consent of the Plaintiffs husband and demanded a sum of Rupees

11,753,579/-. The matter then proceeded to trial following the recording of issues

and admissions. Evidence was led on behalf of the Plaintiff. After the conclusion

of the Plaintiffs evidence, a date was granted for the Defendant to lead his

evidence. The date granted was 18.06.2018. On that day, the Defendant was

absent as he was overseas. The Court refixed it to 21.08.2018, on which date the

Defendant continued to be overseas. When the case was taken up on 28.11.2018,

the Defendants Attorney-at-Law informed the Court that the Defendant was

unwell and therefore unable to attend Court. On 28.11.2018, the learned District

Page 4 of 12

Judge fixed the matter for judgment on the basis that the Defendant had not

provided cogent reasons for the continuous postponements.

According to the journal entries, a number of dates were taken by the

Defendant to postpone the case.

The Defendant filed a leave to appeal application against the said Order of

the District Judges refusal to give a date on the basis that this has caused him

grave prejudice as he was of ill health. It was argued that the learned District

Judge ought to have granted a date for him to lead evidence in compliance with

the Audi Alteram Partem principle encapsulated in the principles of natural

justice. In the leave to appeal application filed in the Civil Appellate High Court

of the Northern Province holden at Jaffna, the Defendant prayed for a stay of

further proceedings in the District Court pending the determination of the leave

to appeal application. In the meantime, the learned District Judge held in favour

of the Plaintiff and delivered the judgment on 20.02.2019, ejecting the Defendant.

Leave before the Civil Appellate High Court of Jaffna was then refused on the

basis that judgment had already been delivered.

Being aggrieved by the judgment, the Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal

and Petition of Appeal in the Civil Appellate High Court of Jaffna. A Revision

application was also filed in the same court as well. The Plaintiff made an

application in the District Court for the execution of the decree of the District

Court on 20.02.2020, after a lapse of one year from the date of the judgment.

According to the journal entries, a number of dates were given because of the

Covid-19 lockdowns. After serving notice, Counsel for the Defendant appeared on

17.06.2020 and moved for a date to file objections and the Court granted that

request. The case was fixed for 15.09.2020. As per the Petition and the journal

entries, the said Attorney was instructed to move for a further date for objections

as the Defendant was unable to return to the island to hand over pertinent

documents since the Sri Lankan airports continued to remain closed, due to the

Covid-19 lockdowns.

Page 5 of 12

When the case was called on 15.09.2020, the Counsel for the Defendant

made an application to move for a date to file objections. However, the Counsel for

the Plaintiff brought to the notice of the Court that the Defendant had altered the

structure of the premises and caused damages to the property. According to the

document marked K, the proceedings dated 15.09.2020, the Court considered the

submissions made by both parties, especially the fact that a number of dates were

taken by the Defendant, and allowed the writ to be executed on the basis that if

the writ is not executed severe hardship would be caused to the Plaintiff.

This Court observed from the brief that the Defendant had appointed one

Shanmugam Pahitharan as his Attorney, through a Special Power of Attorney,

attested by Raatnam Raguraajah, Notary Public on 10.10.2019, to attend to and

appear for him before any court in Sri Lanka. It is the same Power of Attorney

holder who has given an affidavit on behalf of the Defendant to file the present

application as well. This shows that at the writ pending appeal stage there was a

Power of Attorney holder on behalf of the Defendant who could have appeared on

his behalf and could have informed the Registered Attorney to appear on his

behalf.

The Defendant in his written submissions has stated the reason for the

Power of Attorney holder to not participate in the writ pending appeal inquiry was

that the holder did not have personal knowledge of this matter. On the other hand,

the present application is filed by the said Power of Attorney holder who has given

the affidavit on behalf of the Defendant. This is tantamount to misleading the

Court. Further, the same Power of Attorney holder has in his affidavit indicated,

in Paragraphs 36,37,38, and 39 that the Defendant was abroad, and therefore he

could not appear. It is true that the Defendant was abroad but, his Power of

Attorney holder, who was in the country could have appeared on his behalf. There

was a valid Power of Attorney which authorised him to appear, which for some

reason he did not do so. This may be indicative of them not wanting to conclude

the proceedings so that the status quo remains in their favour.

Page 6 of 12

The Defendant is now before this Court on the ground that the aforesaid

judgment and Order of the learned District Judge is a grave and positive

miscarriage of justice primarily due to the Defendant being deprived of giving

evidence on two occasions when he was not at fault on both occasions. An allied

grievance raised by the Defendant is that the District Court has not considered

his ill health when the Counsel for the Defendant had brought it to the notice of

the learned District Judge.

When we perused the judgment, it was evident that the learned District

Judge has considered the Defendants conduct, in his continuous pushing for

postponements and not producing the relevant medical certificate. This was the

basis for the learned District Judge to refuse to give a further date. Even in the

instant application, the Defendant has not filed any supporting documents, such

as a medical certificate, to prove he was unwell at that time.

The present application is also based on the contention that the learned

District Judge had given the Order to execute the decree without summons having

been served on him. It should be noted that when the case was called on

15.09.2020, the Attorney- at -Law who appeared on behalf of the Defendant, who

was the Registered Attorney, did not inform Court that he had no instructions.

Neither did he inform Court that the Defendant did not receive notice. He himself

made an application to indicate to the Court that the Defendant is residing in

Canada and due to the closure of airports he could not travel back to Sri Lanka

and produced an e-mail marked "x". The learned District Judge in his Order has

stated that notice has been served to the Defendant. Nonetheless, it must be

reiterated that at the time there was a valid Power of Attorney holder, which the

Defendant had not disclosed to the Court through his lawyer.

Our Courts have held that parties summoned by Court owe a duty to even

indicate the status of their change of address. This was discussed by Her Ladyship

Eva Wanasundera J. in the judgment of Union Trust & Investments Ltd. v.

Madagodage Thusitha Wijesena, S.C. Appeal 91/2012 decided on 06.03.2015. Her

Ladyship held,

Page 7 of 12

I am of the view that if any party to a case intentionally avoids the service

of papers from Court, that would amount to fraud

It is my view that the Respondents owe a duty to inform court of any change

of address since they appeared before court after receiving summons in the first

instance when the case was initially filed and summons were served on them. If

they never appeared in court, I would say that they do not owe a duty to inform

court of any change of address. The Civil Procedure Code is fashioned in such a

way that in every step of the way till execution of writ is concluded, the judgment

debtor has to be notified by the judgment creditor so that the judgment debtor gets

a chance to stop execution of writ against him and pay off as decreed. Parties

before court should corporate with the provisions of procedure of court and not

abuse the process of court

I am of the opinion that, upon a party filing a proxy and giving its address

to court, any change in such address should be promptly notified to court. It is the

bounden duty of such party to notify court of a change in its address. The other

party cannot be faulted or made to suffer as a result of a change of address being

not notified to court

Her Ladyship referred to the judgment of Cross World (Pvt.) Ltd. v. Union

Trust & Investment SC Appeal No. 36/2010 SC Minutes of 16.05.2011, delivered

by His Lordship Imam J., in which it was held that, consequent to filing of proxy

and entering an appearance in court, the parties before court had a duty to inform

court of the change of address.

We observe that the conduct of the Defendant in so far as he was avoiding

the service of summons displays dishonesty on his part.

In the instant case, the Registered Attorney himself had appeared and

moved for a date to file objections. According, to the document marked K, the

proceedings dated 15.09.2020, Counsel for the Defendant appeared and made an

application stating that he could not file objections as the Defendant was abroad,

and then moved to file objections on another date. As alluded to above, neither is

Page 8 of 12

there any indication that he did not have instructions nor is there any indication

that the Defendant did not receive notice. According to the Order made by the

learned District Judge, notice had been served and Counsel for the Defendant

appeared on 17.06. 2020, to move for a further date to file objections, which request

Court acceded to. However, the Defendant informed this Court that he had not

received notice.

The question arising in this context is whether it is necessary for notice to

be served on Defendant when his Registered Attorney has taken notice?

Section 29(1) of the Civil Procedure Code provides for these types of

scenarios. This Section reads as follows,

Any process served on the registered attorney of any party or left at the

office or ordinary residence of such registered attorney, relative to an action or

appeal, except where the same is for the personal appearance of the party, shall

be presumed to be duly communicated and made known to the party whom the

registered attorney represents; and, unless the court otherwise directs, shall be as

effectual for all purposes in relation to the action or appeal as if the same had been

given to, or served on, the party in person [emphasis added]

This provision was discussed in the case of Rasiah v. Ranmany & Others

(1978-79) 2 SLR 88. It was held that in terms of the aforesaid provision, a notice

served on the Attorney-at-Law for the Appellant was sufficient notice to the

Appellant.

We are mindful that when parties file the Notice and Petition of Appeal our

courts have held that the papers should be filed by the Instructing Attorney and

no one else. The writ of execution is a corollary of the judgment delivered. On that

basis, the proxy given to the Registered Attorney-at-Law, will continue until

revocation, and he will be an agent of the Defendant. Therefore, we hold that there

is no impropriety in the instant case.

The Defendant has invoked the revisionary and restitutionary jurisdiction

of this Court. It is settled law that the revisionary jurisdiction of a court exercising

Page 9 of 12

appellate powers cannot be invoked merely because there is an error of law or fact

in an order or judgment but could only be done where there are exceptional

circumstances and/or extraordinary grounds that shock the conscience of Court

(Vide Union Trust and Investments Ltd (supra)). The conduct of the Defendant

insofar as he was avoiding the service of summons is what shocks the conscience

of this Court.

Our Courts have consistently held that in order to succeed in an application

for restitutio in integrum, a Constitutional remedy, which is an extraordinary one,

the applicant seeking relief must display honesty and frankness.

One such case is M.A. Don Lewis v. D.W.S. Dissanayake,70 NLR 8, in which

His Lordship Tennekoon J. (as he then was) held,

Further even in his present application to this court the petitioner does not

display the honesty and frankness which is expected of a person seeking to invoke

the extraordinary powers of this court.

(This passage has been referred to in Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation v.

Shanmugam [1995] 1 SLR 55, and most recently in C.A. RI 04/2018 decided on

25.11.2020)

In the instant case, the Defendants silence on the existence of the Power of

Attorney is a fatal lapse on his part.

The conduct of the Defendant shows that the Defendant has been the

defaulter since the very beginning. Therefore, this Court cannot intervene to grant

the desired remedy of restitutio-in-integrum for want of honesty and frankness on

the part of the Defendant.

In order for this Court to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction, there must be

exceptional circumstances warranting such an intervention. The Defendant has

not been successful in proving to the satisfaction of this Court the existence of any

such circumstance.

Page 10 of 12

An observation that I would venture to make at this stage is the importance

of guarding against an abuse of the process of courts.

What amounts to an abuse of process has been analysed in detail by the

Indian Courts.

One such case is Ranipet Municipality v. M. Shamsheerkhan 1998 (1) CTC

66, in which the Madras High Court held,

What is 'abuse of the process of the Court'? Of course, for the term 'abuse

of the process of the Court' the Code of Civil Procedure has not given any

definition. A party to a litigation is said to be guilty of abuse of process of the Court,

in any of the following cases:-

(1) Gaining an unfair advantage by the use of a rule of procedure.

(2) Contempt of the authority of the Court by a party or stranger.

(3) Fraud or collusion in Court proceedings as between parties.

(4) ..

(5) Resorting to and encouraging multiplicity of proceedings.

(6) Circumventing of the law by indirect means.

(7) ..

(8) Institution of vexatious, obstructive or dilatory actions..

In Kishore Samrite v. State of U.P., (2013) 2 SCC 398, the Indian Supreme

Court clearly elucidated principles that govern the obligations of a litigant as

follows,

(i) Courts have, over the centuries, frowned upon litigants who, with intent

to deceive and mislead the Courts, initiated proceedings without full disclosure of

facts and came to the courts with unclean hands. Courts have held that such

Page 11 of 12

litigants are neither entitled to be heard on the merits of the case nor entitled to

any relief.

(ii).

(iii) The obligation to approach the Court with clean hands is an absolute

obligation and has repeatedly been reiterated by this Court..

Their Lordships of the Supreme Court further observed,

The person seeking equity must do equity. It is not just the clean hands,

but also clean mind, clean heart and clean objective that are the equi-

fundamentals of judicious litigationWide jurisdiction of the court should not

become a source of abuse of the process of law by the disgruntled litigant. Careful

exercise is also necessary to ensure that the litigation is genuine, not motivated

by extraneous considerations and imposes an obligation upon the litigant to

disclose the true facts and approach the court with clean hands. No litigant can

play hide and seek with the courts or adopt pick and choose. True facts ought to

be disclosed as the Court knows law, but not facts.

Recently, His Lordship Nawaz J. in Sankapala Arachchilage Siriwardena

v. Don Kithsiri Ranjith Athukorale, C.A. Case No. 955/2000 (F) decided on

24.03.2016, held,

The provisions of law cannot be used at the whims and fancy of a litigant

to abuse the process of Court. It appears to me that the Defendant is on a voyage

of discovery of some legal loophole of the provisions of the law to abuse the process

of the Court.

In the instant case, the Plaintiff successfully litigated the case and obtained

judgment in her favour in 2019. After winning the battle, to date, she is deprived

of the fruits of that. Is it not an abuse of process to simply file an application for

restitutio-in-integrum asking for a stay order depriving the Plaintiff of the fruits

of her successful litigation?

Page 12 of 12

We are of the view that the conduct of the Defendant, in seeking to deprive

the Plaintiff of the fruits of her successful litigation, is resorting to conduct that

constitutes an abuse of the process of the Court.

In the words of Justice Bhagwati (as he then was) in Bandhua Mukti

Morcha v. Union of India 1984 AIR 802 the Court must be ever vigilant against

the abuse of its process. The Court does not do justice to the other parties to the

proceedings in question if it allows its process to be abused.

Therefore, we dismiss the application with costs.
