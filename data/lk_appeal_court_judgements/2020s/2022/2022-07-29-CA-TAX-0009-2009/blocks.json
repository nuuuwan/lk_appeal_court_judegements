The Appellant transferred a land at Rajagiriya to a property developer, named Keangnam Ceylon (Pvt) Limited in 1994 for a sum of Rs. 82 Million. On 01.07.1994, Keangnam Ceylon (Pvt) Limited (hereinafter referred to as Keangnam) settled the purchase consideration of Rs. 82 Million by the issue of 8,200,000 cumulative preference shares of Rs. 10/- each in the capital of the said company, credited as fully paid up carrying a dividend rate of 28 percent for a period of three years. [3] The Appellant further entered into an agreement in July 1994 with Keangnam, whereby keangnam agreed that after the completion of the construction of a High Rise Apartment Complex, it shall redeem the said 8,200,000 28% redeemable cumulative preference shares of Rs. 10/- and in lieu of the redemption proceeds of the said preference shares and the cumulative dividends thereon, totaling Rs. 150,000,000/-, to transfer to the Appellant, 28 residential units. In terms of clause 13 of the agreement, the parties agreed that in the event that it is not legally permissible for Keangnam to declare and pay the cumulative dividends on the 8,200,000 redeemable preference shares of Rs. 10/- each, and or redeem the preference shares and or transfer the said 28 residential units to the Appellant in lieu of redemption proceeds, the Appellant shall be entitled to demand payment of the guaranteed amount or be entitled to all other remedies available at law including specific performance. The Appellant took possession of the said residential units in the year 1998/1999 in lieu of the redemption of the preference shares in terms of the said agreement but the transfer of deeds was executed subsequently.",

No existing principle or provision at variance with them can be applied in determining the chargeable profits and gains. All transactions encompassed by Section 45 must fall under the governance of its computation provisions. A transaction to which those provisions cannot be applied must be regarded as never intended by Section 45 to be the subject of the charge. This inference flows from the general arrangement of the provisions in the Income-tax Act, where under each head of income the charging provision is accompanied by a set of provisions for computing the income subject to that charge. The character of the computation provisions in each case bears a relationship to the nature of the charge. Thus the charging section and the computation provisions together constitute an integrated code. When there is a case to which the computation provisions cannot apply at all, it is evident that such a case was not intended to fall within the charging section. Otherwise, one would be driven to conclude that while a certain income seems to fall within the charging section there is no scheme of computation for quantifying it. The legislative pattern discernible in the Act is against such a conclusion. It must be borne in mind that the legislative intent is presumed to run uniformly through the entire conspectus of provisions pertaining to each head of income. No doubt there is a qualitative difference between the charging provision and a computation provision. And ordinarily the operation of the charging provision cannot be affected by the construction of a particular computation provision. But the question here is whether it is possible to apply the computation provision at all if a certain interpretation is pressed on the charging provision. That pertains to the fundamental integrality of the statutory scheme provided for each head.",
