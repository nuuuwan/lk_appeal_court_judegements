This is an appeal against the order dated 22.10.2018, delivered by the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province holden in Colombo, where

it acted in revision and affirmed the vehicle confiscation order dated

23.03.2021 delivered by the Magistrate Court of Nugegoda under the

Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, as amended (hereinafter the Act).

The claimant-petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter the appellant) has preferred

the instant appeal to this Court in order to have both the orders set aside,

and thereby disallow the confiscation of the vehicle bearing registration

no. WP GU- 9190.

The facts of the case are briefly as follows. The 1st accused-respondent

(hereinafter the accused) was charged in the Magistrate Court of Nugegoda

for using the above-named vehicle for committing following offences,

CPA-0111-21 Page 4 of 8 15/11/2022 IJ-52-22

I. Permanent or temporary building being constructed or allowed

to be

constructed in the vicinity of Bellanwila Sanctuary, without the

permission of Relevant Authorities of Government of which the

said land belongs to the government.

II. Temporary or constructed road being used in Bellanwila

Sanctuary without permission of relevant authorities,

As in commission of such offences, the said vehicle was employed without

a valid permit, the accused was charged with contravening the Fauna and

Flora Protection Ordinance (as amended). The Magistrate Court of

Nugegoda framed charges against the accused on 19.08.2020. The

accused pleaded guilty to the charges, upon which, the learned Magistrate

imposed a fine of Rs 15000/=.

An inquiry was held by the learned Magistrate on 21.10.2020, allowing

cause to be shown as to why the vehicle in question should not be

confiscated, pursuant to which the appellant gave evidence. After the

conclusion of the evidence adduced to by the appellant, the learned

Magistrate ordered the vehicle to be confiscated for want of due diligence

on the part of the registered owner of the vehicle, as per the proviso to

Section 64(1) of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, as amended

by Act No. 22 of 2009.

It is therefore pertinent to produce the relevant law at this juncture, which

is as follows:

Section 64(1) - Except as hereinbefore expressly provided in regard

to the disposal of any elephant or of the carcass of any elephant or

the tusks or tushes of any elephant, on the conviction of any person

for an offence under this Ordinance, any animal, plant or part of such

animal or part which is the property of the State under this Ordinance

and any gun, vehicle, boat, artificial light, snare, net, trap or any

other instrument, contrivance, appliance or thing used in or for the

CPA-0111-21 Page 5 of 8 15/11/2022 IJ-52-22

commission of any offence, shall by reason of that conviction, in

addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be

forfeited to the State:

Provided however, where the owner of such gun, vehicle, boat,

artificial light, snare, net , trap or other instrument, contrivance,

appliance or thing used in or for the commission of any offence is a

third party, no forfeiture shall be made if such owner proves to

the satisfaction of the court that he had used all due diligence

to prevent the use of such gun, vehicle, boat, artificial light, snare,

net, trap or other instrument, contrivance, appliance or thing used in

or for the commission of any offence." (Emphasis added)

Accordingly, the above provision casts the burden upon the owner of a

vehicle to prove to the satisfaction of the court, on a balance of probability,

that he has exercised due diligence in order to ensure that the said vehicle

would not be employed for any activities contravening the law. There is no

objectively-determined threshold to reach in exercising due diligence, as it

would be decided through judicial discretion according to the

circumstances of each individual case.

The legal term due diligence has not been predefined in the Ordinance

itself, however, by looking into the objectives of the legislation, specifically

the preamble, it is evident that the it caters towards the conservation of

the biodiversity of Sri Lanka by imposing laws to prevent any hindrance

caused to the fauna and flora of Sri Lanka, while protecting the rights of

the people connected to incidents therein. Thus, as per Section 64(1) of

the Act, the law delivers the opportunity to an owner of a vehicle which

was employed in committing such offences to prove to the satisfaction of

the court, that due diligence has been exercised by him/her to prevent the

commission of such offences. This law is aligned with the principle of

natural justice where every person has a natural right to his property and

thus must be heard before having their property forfeited.

CPA-0111-21 Page 6 of 8 15/11/2022 IJ-52-22

The House of Lords in re Hamilton on 1981 AC 1038 has stressed that:

"One of the principles of natural justice is that a person is entitled to

adequate notice and opportunity to be heard before any judicial order

is pronounced against him, so that he or someone acting on behalf

may make such representations if any, as he seems fit. This is the

rule of audi alteram partem which applies to all judicial

proceedings"

Thus, it is evident that the above Ordinance, while preserving the fauna

and flora of Sri Lanka, has also delivered importance to an individuals

rights over his/her property. As such, Section 64(1) allows an owner of a

vehicle to make his/her case and to show cause as to why such vehicle

should not be forfeited.

Accordingly, the appellant has submitted evidence to the court during the

inquiry. However, she has merely narrated the events preceding the

commission of the said offence, without attempting to convincingly

establish the measures she had taken as a responsible owner. The

appellant has averred that she asked the accused not to engage the vehicle

in illegal activities as it provides for her only source of income. However,

the evidence submitted during the inquiry revealed that the said vehicle

had also been employed in an offence prior to the instant matter, and that

the appellant has failed to mention such a pending case during the cross-

examination. The discrepancies and inconsistencies in the evidence of the

appellant and her failure to prevent the commission of such an offence for

a second time, prove that she has not acted with due diligence to prevent

the use of the vehicle to commit an offence.

The Blacks Law Dictionary expounds due diligence as The diligence

reasonably expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a person who seeks

to satisfy a legal requirement or to discharge an obligation. As such, the

requisite of due diligence on the part of an owner of a vehicle, necessitates

CPA-0111-21 Page 7 of 8 15/11/2022 IJ-52-22

the owner to take measures as an ordinary, reasonable person to discharge

the obligation of ensuring that her vehicle is not employed in any illegal

activities, which she has failed to do for the second time.

Similar to the Fauna and Flora Ordinance, the Animals Act, No. 29 of 1958

and the Forest Ordinance, as amended by Act No. 65 of 2009, under

Section 3A and Section 40 respectively, provide for the power of

confiscation to the Magistrate Court of vehicles used in committing

offences stipulated under those laws, unless otherwise proved to the

satisfaction of the court that the owner of the vehicle has taken the all

necessary precautions to prevent it. All such similar legal provisions have

cast the burden upon the owner of a vehicle to prove on a balance of

probability that precautionary measures were taken to prevent the

commission of offences. However, the Fauna and Flora Protection Act goes

beyond and casts a burden on the owner to establish on a balance of

probability that diligence has been duly exercised in order to prevent such

offences.

This Court observes that the appellant has failed to dispense such burden

in this instant matter as evident from the fact that the matter at hand is

the second time the said vehicle has been employed in illegal activities.

The accused being the husband of the appellant, there exists a close

relationship between the driver and the owner, where due diligence can be

easily exercised with regards to a vehicle which is often used by both the

parties in the ordinary course of conducting the appellants alleged pol

roti business. Hence merely instructing the accused does not satisfy this

court that due diligence on the part of the appellant as a responsible owner

of a vehicle has been met.

Therefore, this court is of the view that the appellant has not proved on a

balance of probability that she has exercised due diligence in order to

prevent the use of her vehicle in committing such offences, and as such

the court agrees with the conclusion of the learned Magistrate. Further,

CPA-0111-21 Page 8 of 8 15/11/2022 IJ-52-22

this court observes that the Learned High Court Judge has correctly

dismissed the revision application.

Accordingly, we see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned

High Court Judge dated 23.03.2021, and the confiscation order of the

learned Magistrate dated 18.11.2020. Therefore, this Court affirms the

same.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
