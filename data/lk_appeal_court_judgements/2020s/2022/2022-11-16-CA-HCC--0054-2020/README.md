JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General for

committing an offence under section 364(2) read with Section 364 (2) (e) of

the Penal Code for committing statutory rape on Kukule Viyannalage

Nayanasiri Priyangika Madhuwanthi between 01/08/2006 to 15/09/2006.

The trial commenced on 11/10/2018. After leading all necessary witnesses

and marking Production P1-P2, the prosecution had closed the case on

22/10/2019. The Learned High Court Judge had called for the defence on

the same day and the counsel for the Appellant had moved for a day to call

witnesses on his behalf. The Appellant had given evidence from witness box,

called several witnesses and marked documents X1, X2, X3 and X3 (a) and

closed his case.

The Learned High Court Judge after considering the evidence presented by

both parties, convicted the Appellant as charged and sentenced him to 18

years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs.25,000/- subject to a

default sentence of 06 months simple imprisonment. In addition, a

compensation of Rs.500000/- was ordered with a default sentence of 02

years rigorous imprisonment.

3 | P a g e

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that

the Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. During the argument he was connected via Zoom

from prison.

The Learned Presidents Counsel contends that based on the evidence

offered, it is impossible to conclude that the prosecution has proven its case

against the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

According to PW1, the incident pertaining to this case had occurred when

she was attending year five class at Opanayaka Vidyalankara Maha

Vidyalaya. She was 10 years old and the Appellant was her class teacher at

that time. Her class was functioned in a hall with a stage. The alleged

incident had happened inside the changing room which is situated beside

the stage.

On the date of the incident, the Appellant had entrusted the task to clean

the changing room to the victim. When she was cleaning the room, the

Appellant had come behind, held her and put her on a desk. After removing

her under garment the Appellant had inserted his penis in to her vagina and

had raped her. As it was painful, she had shouted but none had come for

her help. After the act, the Appellant had asked her to go home but reminded

her not to divulge this incident to anybody. Although she encountered an

unpleasant incident, she did not divulge it anybody including her parents.

She attained puberty before this incident.

After about 16 months from the 1st incident, on 26/11/2007 she had lodged

a complaint against a person called Sagara for raping her. This incident had

come to light when her mother confronted her with regard to arriving late

home after school. When her mother assaulted and questioned her, she had

divulged the incident of rape by Sagara. But she did not divulge anything

4 | P a g e

about 1st incident which had happened to her in the school. At the police

station when she was questioned whether she had encountered any incident

similar to the second one, the victim had come forward for the first time

about the alleged raping incident by the Appellant. Even her mother had got

to know the 1st incident at the police station.

The Appellant giving evidence from witness box denied the incident.

The prosecutrix came out about the first incident pertains to this case first

time when she promptly lodged her complaint against Sagara who had raped

her on 26/11/2007.

In the cross examination, the prosecutrix admitted that on the day of the

first incident, her friends Keshani, Sivahari and Ranjula were present. The

prosecutrix had made two statements to the police. In her first statement she

asserted that the Appellant had asked her to stay behind when other children

were not present there. In her second statement she had mentioned about

other students presence. The prosecution, although had named the other

children of the prosecutrixs class as witnesses in the indictment, had not

called them to give evidence during the trial.

PW3, DMO Balangoda submitted the Medico Legal Report of the prosecutrix

which had been marked as P1. In the short history the doctor had noted that

a similar incident which had been occurred from another person in the year

2006. The doctor even though admitted that he obtained the short history

from BHT of the prosecutrix, the prosecution had not taken any measures to

produce the same during the trial. According to the doctor who had examined

the prosecutrix, there were no external injuries present and the hymen was

not to be seen. The doctor had examined the witness on 27/11/2007 after

Sagara raped her.

The admissibility of the recorded history in the Medico-Legal Report as

evidence in criminal trials has been discussed in several decided cases.

5 | P a g e

In Gamini Dolawatte V. Attorney General [1988] 1 Sri. L. R 221 held that:

While a Medico-Legal Report is admissible in evidence under Section

414(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, hearsay evidence by way

of the case history embodied in such a report is not admissible as such

history is information is not ascertained by the Doctor from his own

examination of the injured.

Under this backdrop, now I consider whether the evidence given by the

prosecutrix could be accepted without any corroboration to prove the charge

of rape against the Appellant.

In Sunil and Another v. The Attorney General [1986] 1 Sri.L.R. 230 the

court held that:

It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman

victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence

could be acted on even in the absence of corroboration.

In State of Andra Pradesh v. Garigula Satya Vani Murty AIR 1997 SC

1588, it was held that:

the courts are expected to show great responsibility while tying an

accused on a charge of rape. They must deal with such cases with

utmost sensitivity.

As stated earlier, the incident pertains to this case had been only revealed

on 27/11/2007 about 16 months after the incident. Hence no medical

evidence available to substantiate the claim of the prosecutrix. Further the

prosecution has failed to call the fellow students who were present at that

time. She already attained puberty when the alleged incident said to have

happened.

6 | P a g e

According to PW3, mother of the prosecutrix, during her examination in

chief, she told the court that her daughter revealed sexual harassment

perpetrated by the Appellant while making a testimony regarding a rape

event allegedly committed by one Sagara. The relevant portions of her

evidence are re-produced below:

7 | P a g e

In Iswari Prasad v. Mohamed Isa 1963 AIR (SC) 1728 at 1734 His Lordship

held that;

In considering the question as to whether evidence given by the witness

should be accepted or not, the court has, no doubt, to examine whether

the witness is an interested witness and to enquire whether the story

deposed to by him is probable and whether it has been shaken in cross-

examination. That is - whether there is a ring of truth surrounding his

testimony.

Under these circumstances, accepting prosecutrixs evidence without

corroboration for the charge of rape will cause great prejudice to the

Appellants right to have a fair trial. Hence, I conclude that finding the

Appellant guilty to the charge of rape is untenable considering the

circumstances of this case. Therefore, his conviction entered by the Learned

High Court Judge Ratnapura hereby is set aside.

Therefore, now I consider whether the Appellant could be found guilty to a

lesser offence considering the available evidence.

According to the facts of this case, the Appellant being the class teacher of

the prosecutrix, using his authority and breaching the trust as a teacher

intentionally used force on the prosecutrix and touched her body and

removed her under garment and thereby has caused sexual harassment.

8 | P a g e

Section 345 of Penal Code as amended states:

Whoever, by assault or use of criminal force, sexually harasses

another person, or by the use of words or actions, causes sexual

annoyance or harassment to such other person commits the offence of

sexual harassment and shall on conviction be punished with

imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five

years or with fine or with both and may also be ordered to pay

compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in

respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to

such person.

EXPLANATION

1. Unwelcome sexual advances by words or action used by a person in

authority, to a working place or any other place, shall constitute the

offence of sexual harassment.

2.For the purposes of this section an assault may include any act that

does not amount to rape under section 363 or grave sexual abuse

under section 365B.

3. "injuries" includes psychological or mental trauma.

Hence, acting under Section 335(2) (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979 I substitute a conviction under Section 345 of the Penal Code

as amended and impose the Appellant a period of five years rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10000/- with a default sentence of 01-year

rigorous imprisonment. Further, the Appellant is ordered to pay a sum of

9 | P a g e

Rs.300000/- to the PW1 as compensation and in default serve 2 years of

rigorous imprisonment.

Considering all the circumstances of this case I order the sentence to take

effect from the date of conviction i.e., from the 25/06/2020.

Subject to the above variations, the appeal is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
