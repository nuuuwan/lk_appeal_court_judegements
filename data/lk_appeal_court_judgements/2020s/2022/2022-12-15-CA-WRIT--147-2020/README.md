The Petitioner, a recipient of a block of land allotted to her by the State for her

contribution to the field of art, is now before this Court, in terms of Article 140 of the

Constitution, praying, inter alia, for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision evinced by

the letter dated 17th January 2020 (P10) issued under the hand of the 2nd Respondent,

(the Chairman of the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha) which purports to revoke the

approvals granted for the construction of a house on the said block of land.

In the year 2002, the Government allotted blocks of land to twenty-six artists, one

of whom was the Petitioner, for their contribution to the field of art. The land allocated

for this purpose, named Mattegodawatta, situated within the local limits of the

Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha, was previously vested in the Land Reform Commission,

by virtue of the Land Reform Law No. 1 of 1972, as amended. The Petitioner was allotted

Lot No. 15 (depicted in Subdivision Plan No. 420 dated 10th April 2002 prepared by one

K.W.D. Chandrani, Licensed Surveyor (P3)) in the said land. This allotment of land was

alienated to the Petitioner by the Land Reform Commission, exercising its powers under

Page 3 of 8

Section 22(1)(c) of the Act, by Deed of Transfer No. 504 executed on 3rd March 2004 (P4).

The said Subdivision Plan was approved by the Urban Development Authority

(hereinafter referred to as the UDA), on an application made by the Petitioner, subject

to certain conditions such as the construction of the drainage system and access roads on

the instructions of the Authority (P5). The UDA also, having considered the building

application of the Petitioner, granted approval for the proposed building plan, and the

corresponding Development Permit (P7- dated 14th October 2019) was issued by the

Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha (the 1st Respondent) acting for and on behalf of the UDA.

This permit is subject to annual renewal. Having received the requisite approvals, she

then commenced the preparatory work to build her residence.

The Petitioner, thereafter, received a letter dated 19th December 2019 (P9) from

the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha. The letter notes that groups representing local

inhabitants have objected to the allocation and consequent development of the allotted

land because the allocated land is a wetland. She was requested to attend a discussion

on the 27th of December at the sub-office of the Pradeshiya Sabha, in which she

participated. However, she contends that she was not afforded a proper opportunity to

present her case at the discussion.

After this discussion, while the preparatory work for construction was ongoing, she

received the impugned letter (P10). This letter, dated 17th January 2020, issued under

the hand of the 2nd Respondent, to the Petitioner, among others, states that the Land

Reform Commission, the UDA, the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, the

Disaster Management Centre, and the Divisional Secretariat had all previously agreed,

and the Pradeshiya Sabha had separately adopted a resolution on 30th May 2008, to

preserve the status quo of the wetland based on the recommendation of the Central

Environmental Authority, by its letter dated 6th May 2008. Further, that it had been

decided to cancel the approvals granted for the construction of the residences; to remove

any structures existing on the said lands with police protection, and for lands to be

allocated for the artists in a more suitable area. These decisions were made considering

the harmful impact on the wetland. This letter titled

( ) reads:

The Petitioner contends that this decision is arbitrary, unlawful, and in violation

of her legitimate expectation.

We will now address this contention.

It is argued that the relevant authority to make the decision whether to revoke the

approvals is the UDA and not the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha. In response to the

Respondents objection that the UDA ought to have been added as a party to this

application, the Petitioner stated, in her Counter-Objections (in Paragraph 17) that there

was no need to so add since there was no cause of action against the UDA. This was

because the UDA did not take any step in order to cancel and or revise any approval

and/or licences already granted to the Petitioner.

The Respondents in their Statement of Objections (in Paragraph 8) note that in

terms of the law and the regulations the authority and/or power for the approval of

subdivision plans and building plans are vested with the Urban Development Authority,

but Urban Development Authority has delegated the said powers to the relevant local

authorities. Further, the approval is granted by the Planning Committee of the local

Page 5 of 8

authority and the relevant officers of the relevant local authority, but, the presence of the

representative of the UDA is a mandatory requirement for the said purpose.

On a perusal of the relevant applicable laws, it appears that the delegatee (in this

case the relevant officer of the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha) when exercising or

discharging any power, duty, or function delegated to it, it must do so under the direction,

supervision, and control of the Urban Development Authority. The delegatee cannot

exercise those powers at their own will. If it does, the decisions or actions would be null

and void as they are ultra vires.

In the instant case, there are two documents on the record, one submitted by the

Petitioner (P12) and one submitted by the Respondents (R15) that demonstrate that

the decision of the Respondents, as evinced in the impugned letter, are not proprio vigore.

With regard to the former, the Statement of Objections states thus:

The 2nd Respondent sent the letter dated 06-03-2020 to the Director of the Urban

Development Authority which is marked P12 with the Petition of the Petitioner seeking necessary

advise to take steps to cancel the approvals already granted including the Petitioners since Urban

Development Authority is the appropriate authority to act in respect of granting and cancellation

of the approvals for development purposes. [emphasis added]

In the latter (R15) the Director (Western Province) of the UDA, by letter dated

16th July 2020, in response to P12, requests the Secretary of the Homagama Pradeshiya

Sabha to discuss the reasons for revoking the approvals at the Planning Committee

meeting and to forward the same to the UDA in order for it to instruct whether to revoke

the approvals. The relevant portion of this letter reads:

.

Thus, there has been no decision to revoke or cancel the permit yet, or rather, there

is nothing before us to demonstrate the same. The decisions communicated in the

impugned letter have not been made under the supervision or direction or control of the

UDA. Therefore, they cannot be deemed to be decisions proprio vigore. It is merely a

communication to the UDA. To use the words of his Lordship Sharvananda J. (as he then

was) in Fernando v. Jayaratne 78 NLR 123, this decision has no binding force; it is not

a step in consequence of which legally enforceable rights may be created or extinguished.

As this Court does not possess a magical crystal ball to predict the future course of action

Page 6 of 8

of the UDA, especially whether it will revoke the approvals, we are of the view that this

application is premature.

The reason for the Respondents attempts to revoke the approvals stems from the

fact that the land allocated is a wetland. A perusal of the Central Environmental

Authoritys letter dated 6th May 2008 (the same letter mentioned in the body of the

impugned letter) addressed to the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha, the Land Reform

Commission, and the UDA (R-5(i)), submitted by the Respondents, substantiates this.

This letter recommends the preservation of the natural condition of the wetland as it is

without allowing for any development on the wetland, drawing attention to the dangers

that could result otherwise. This letter reads:

Based on the recommendation of the Central Environmental Authority, and the

observations made by officers of the UDA on a field visit of the land, the Director General

of the UDA by letter dated 16th July 2008 (R5(iv)) informed the Chairman of the

Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha to not permit any development to take place on those lands.

Further, a letter dated 10th July 2008 (R5(ii)) issued by the Director General of the

Disaster Management Centre requests the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha to refrain from

approving a plan to subdivide that land as well. On this basis, a resolution had been

adopted at the General Meeting of the Homagama Pradeshiya Sabha held on the 30th of

May 2008.

This position is quite in contrast to the Land Reform Commission which maintains

that the land is not a wetland. This is seen in its most recent letter to the Homagama

Pradeshiya Sabha (P15) dated 24th January 2022 as well.

We cannot then determine which version is correct, as those authorities are not

before this Court. It is trite law that this Court is not the forum to adjudicate factual

matters in dispute (Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board [1981] 2 SLR 471 as approved in

the case of Dr. Puvanendran v. Premasiri [2009] 2 SLR 107).

But what can be said is that regrettably, this entire dispute stems from the lack of

care and due diligence, or sheer negligence, in the decision-making process when

determining at the very outset the suitability of the land proposed to be allocated for the

purpose of distribution and the subsequent negligence of the authorities concerned in the

process of granting approvals, for the development of the land. The relevant land

allocated, for distribution amongst those artists in appreciation of their contribution to

the field of art, per the documents submitted to this Court appears to be a wetland

(although the Land Reform Commission maintains the contrary position). Owing to the

harmful impact that can be caused to the wetland (if it is so) because of the development

and construction activities on it this Court has the difficult task of having to balance the

unfairness that has been caused to the Petitioner against the real or potentially harmful

or detrimental impact that can be caused to the wetland.

We are also mindful that in addition to the Petitioner, twenty-five other artists

have also been gifted land in recognition of their services. Therefore, development on all

twenty-six blocks of land, as noted in the documents submitted to us, might detrimentally

impact the wetland. The scales of justice would be evenly balanced, if a solution such as

the one apparently proposed in the discussion held on the 27th of December 2019, to

Page 8 of 8

allocate land in a more suitable area is adopted. Considering the plight of the Petitioner,

had all the relevant authorities been before this Court, a settlement of that nature could

have been arrived at.

Nonetheless, as we observed before since there is no decision proprio vigore in

respect of which this Court can exercise its writ jurisdiction, the challenge of balancing

those competing interests does not arise in the present application.

We dismiss this application. However, the dismissal of this Petition must not be

construed as a bar to the Petitioner, if advised, to file a fresh application in appropriate

circumstances.
