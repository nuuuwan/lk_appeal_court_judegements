JUDGMENT

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant [hereinafter referred to as "Appellant"] filed this Appeal

seeking to set aside orders dated 16.9.2012 and 30.10.2012 of the earned High Court Judge of

Ratnapura in case No. H.C.R.A./157/2009 and the order dated 24.07.2009 by the learned

Magistrate of Mount Lavinia in Case No.3532/S/08.

The Applicant-Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent, 2nd Respondent-Respondent and the

Intervenient Petitioner-Respondent-Respondents appeared before this Court. In this judgment,

Applicant Petitioner Respondent Respondent" will be referred to as the respondent 2nd

Respondent-Respondent as the "2nd Respondent", and the Intervenient-Petitioner-Respondent-

Respondent as the "Intervenient- Respondent".

After written submission, the matter was argued. In this judgment, I have considered all parties'

oral and written submissions at the Court of Appeal and documents produced at the High Court

and the Magistrate's Court by the parties.

The Appellant owner of premises No.14D, Sri Gunarathna Mawatha, Mount Lavinia had sought

permission to build and permission was granted by the 1st and the 2nd Respondents. When applying

for permission, there was an old building at the back of the premises. Therefore, the Appellant kept

the rear space from the East of the land. Later as the old building collapsed, she decided to have

the rear area from the West. For this purpose, Plan No.MB/32/2006 was produced and approved

by the Municipality. Approval was granted subject to a provision that she submit an amended plan

for endorsement to be filed of record as an amended, approved plan. However, the Appellant had

spent eight million rupees to construct a three-storied building on the Plan, which was approved

before shifting the rear space.

After the completion of the house, the 1st Respondent informed her that the building was not in

conformity with the approved Plan.

The action was filed in the Magistrate Court of Mount Lavinia Case, No. 1532/S/08, under Section

28A(3) of the Urban Development Authority Act No.41 of 1978. According to the journal Entry

of 17.03.2008, the learned Magistrate had ordered to issue summons to the Appellant. Until

27.02.2009, nearly a year summons was not served on the Appellant. One endorsement gives the

reason as "Defendant cannot be found."

On 27.02.2009, an order was made to serve the summons by substituted service. The Appellant

appeared before the Court and was given a date to fulfil the requirements indicated by the

Respondent. On the second date given, which was the final date for her to comply, she was absent

from Court, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. Once the warrant was recalled, she was given

time to file her objections. As she did not appear before Court to file objections, an order was made

as prayed for by the Respondents.

She then appeared in Court on a subsequent date and pleaded to set aside the demolition order,

which the learned Magistrate refused on 07.08.2009. On 31.08.2009, the Appellant lodged papers

in the High Court of Mount Lavinia seeking to revise the order of the learned Magistrate. The High

Court order was passed, staying the Magistrate's order dated 24.07.2009.

On 09.03.2010, an application for intervention was filed by the intervenient Respondent.

Objections were called regarding the intervention, and parties were heard. On 16.09.2011, the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo granted permission for the party to intervene. On the same

day, the matter was fixed for argument.

The Intervenient Respondent then objected that the Appellant had not filed vital documents in the

Magistrate's Court. She had violated Rule 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules

of 1990.

On perusal of the case record, the learned High Court Judge concluded that the Appellant had

failed to show cause by filling documents or submissions. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge

had found no reason to disturb the learned Magistrate's order dated 24.07.2009.he had emphasised

that it was the duty of the Appellant to file all original documents or certified copies when applying

for the revisionary jurisdiction.

The learned High Court Judge had considered that the Magistrate's order was pronounced on

24.07.2009 when the Appellant moved in revision to the High Court court filing papers to set aside

the order made in her absence, which was rejected on 07.08.2009. The second order, which

confirms the demolition order on 24.07.2009, was not canvassed at the High Court.

According to the learned High Court Judge, even in the petition for revision, the Appellant had

mentioned an Affidavit which is not part and parcel of the papers petitioners filed at the High

Court, which is non-compliance within the meaning of Rule 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules 1990. Dissatisfied by the judgment delivered on 30.10.2012, the Appellant

lodged Appeal papers at the Court of Appeal.

The main question in this Court is to consider the judgment of the learned High Court Judge. The

Appellant must satisfy this Court that the reasoning of the learned High Court Judge is wrong or

that she had filed all necessary papers, which the learned Judge overlooked.

However, having that to the last Appellant took up the position that summons was not served on

her by the learned Magistrate. According to the Magistrate's Court case record, the summons was

issued over eleven months. Then, by substituted service. She should have urged this matter at the

Magistrate's Court.

A position not taken up at the Magistrate's Court or the High Court cannot now be taken up even

though a high emphasis was made that the learned Magistrate had to follow Section 3(a) of Act

No.44 of 1984. An application that should have been taken before the Magistrate at the first

Instance available if not taken is estopped by making the application now.

Page 7 of 7

Section 28A(3) of the Urban Development Authority Act No.44 of 1984 can only be considered

by the learned High Court Judge if papers were filed according to the stipulated appellate

procedure.

It was the duty of the Appellant to be vigilant regarding his case. There are many lapses on the

part of the Appellant. When she knew she had a final date to file objections, she had not even taken

care to get the service of a lawyer, which made the learned Magistrate come to a conclusion on

07.08.2009. She had not paid due diligence when filling the revision papers at the High Court.

Now in this Court, she points out the illegality of the Intervenient parties' intervention. An

objection should have been made on the day intervention was allowed. Time has now passed to

make that application. She fails to show how the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of

Ratnapura dated 30.10.2012 is not according to Rule 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules of 1990.

It is accepted that our courts will not help those who sleep upon their rights.

I see no reasons to disturb the judgment delivered on 30.10.2012. The Appeal is dismissed. No

order for costs is made.
