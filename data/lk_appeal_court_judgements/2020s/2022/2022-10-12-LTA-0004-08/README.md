MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The aggrieved party appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) has filed

this application to set aside the judgment dated 26.03.2008 of High Court of

Mathara.

The accused respondents (hereinafter referred to as the respondents) were

indicted in the High Court for the abduction of Sunil Widanage and

AnuraSamarathunga. The aggrieved party is the wife of Sunil Widanage.

Page 4 of 9

Upon the conclusion of the trial all the respondents have been acquitted by the

High Court and being aggrieved by the said judgment the instant application has

been filed.

Counsel for the appellant made his submissions on two grounds,

(1) The statements being made by the witnesses of the prosecution after a

lapse of seven years (2) Lack of proper identification due to lack of illumination being incorrectly

considered by the High Court Judge.

The story of the prosecution is that, the two abductees namely; Anura

Samanrathunga and Sunil Widanage had hired a vehicle and had gone to the

Kamburupitiya Police Station 12.01.1990. The vehicle owner and driver had

returned home but the two abductees have not returned home. Therefore, the

sister of Anura Samarathunga namely Chandra Malkanthi Samaathunga along

with the mother and the elder brother of Anura Samarathunga had gone to the

Police Station. Thereafter, they had seen a bus coming from the police Station

and they had identified second, third respondents inside the bus along with the

abductees and the second respondent had got off the bus and had rushed

towards the police Station and had brought the OIC of the police Station who is

the eight respondent outside and the eight respondent has given orders to kill

the abductees. Thereafter, the second and third respondents had got into the bus

and bus had proceeded towards Mathara. Thereafter, the sculls of the abductees

have been found.

The Learned High Court judge has analyzed each witness. He had analyzed the

evidence of Chandra Malkanthi and had concluded that the two abductees had

gone to the police Station to obtain police Reports. She had identified the

second, third and the accused respondents in the bus. She had also overheard

Page 5 of 9

the eighth respondent giving orders to dispose the two abductees. But, the high

Court judge had observed that she had made a statement to the CID only in 1997,

and he has concluded that she fails the test of spontaneity. Further, he had

stated that he is unable to accept the fact that, the eighth respondent would be

giving instructions to his subordinates to dispose the two abductees in public

knowing the consequences of such an Act. Furthermore, he had said that the

state of illumination as referred to by the witness is not satisfactory. Therefore he

had rejected the evidence of Malkanthi.

Thereafter, he had proceeded to examine the evidence of Lasika Udayangani

Samaranayake who is the wife of Sunil Widanage and she alleges of a money

transaction between Sunil Widanage and the eighth respondent. She too has

made a statement only in 1997. Therefore, the High Court judge had rejected the

evidence on the basis that she too has made a belated mistake. Thereafter, the

high Court judge has considered the evidence of Munidasa Dissanayake, who

alleges that he had seen the two abductees in the police station in 1990 but he

too has made a statement only in 1997. Then again the high Court judge has

rejected his statement too on the basis of belatedness. Thereafter he has

examined the evidence of a Ceylon transport Bus Driver who had said that in

1990 some Police Officers had taken a bus for some reason but the date and

other details have not been revealed. Therefore, that evidence also the High

Court judge has rejected for lack of clarity.

The evidence of the brother of the abductee had been analyzed but he being an

army officer had failed to take necessary action regarding the alleged

disappearance of his brother for seven years and the failure on the part of the

witness as a responsible citizen had been a basis for the rejection of the evidence

by the High Court Judge.

Page 6 of 9

Therefore, the learned High Court judge has basically rejected the evidence of the

prosecution on the basis of the statements of the witnesses being made

belatedly, and the lack of illumination at the time of identification of the

respondents by the witnesses.

The Additional Solicitor General appearing for the Attorney General stated that

he is playing the role of an amicus to Court in this instance and he too has

concerns regarding the belatedness of the statements of the prosecution and the

improbability of the prosecution story at times and he added that he is not

supporting the submissions of the appellant.

The two Counsels who appeared for the respondents stated that analysis of the

High Court Judge with regard to the evidence of the prosecution is the only

conclusion he could have arrived at, in view of the belatedness of the evidence of

the prosecution and the improbability of the prosecution story at times.

Both the Counsel for the respondents vehemently objected for the request of the

Counsel for the appellant for the instant case to be sent for a retrial or for the

acquittal to be revised. They quoted the case of Attorney General vs Baranage

where Amaratunga J had held thatin an appeal against an acquittal on a

question of fact the prosecution has a heavy burden to discharge. Such an

appeal could only be justified if there had been a palpable misdirection by the

judge when considering the facts of the case which could be demonstrated to be

wrong on the very face of the record and which had in effect resulted in a

miscarriage of justice

Upon consideration of the submissions of all parties this Court is of the opinion

that the story narrated by the witnesses of the prosecution gravelly lack

spontaneity and probability in view of the statements being made after seven

Page 7 of 9

years from the incident and as very correctly pointed out by the trial judge the

alleged behavior of the 8th respondent is highly improbable in view of the fact

the 8th respondent being a police officer, and even the behavior of the brother of

the abductee is also very unlikely ,because he being an army officer did not take

legitimate steps to lodge a formal complaint soon after the incident in a suitable

place. Furthermore the identification of the respondents inside the police bus is

also very unbelievable in view of the level of illumination available at the time of

the incident. Therefore the learned trial judge has arrived at the only conclusion

possible in view of the evidence of the prospection.

At this point this Court draws its attention to the case of Tudor Perera v AG (SC

23/75 D.C. Colombo Bribery 190/B where justice Rajarathnam has held that

when considering the evidence of an interested witness who may desire to

conceal the truth, such evidence must be scrutinized with some care. The

independent witness will normally be reffered to an interested witness in a

case of conflict. Matters of motive, prejudice, partiality, accuracy, incentive,

and reliability have all to be weighed (Vide, Halsbury laws of England, 4th

Edition, para 29). Therefore, the relative weight attached to the evidence of an

interested witness who is a near relative of the accused or whose interests are

closely identified by one party may not prevail over the testimony of an

independent witness (Vide,Hasker v Summers(1884) 10 V.L.R (Eq.)204-

Australia; Leefunteum v Beaudoin (1897)28 S.C.R.89-Canadda).Therefore in the

instant matter the trila judge had to evaluate the evidence of family members

of the abductee hence as stated in the above judgment the trial judge had to

evidence weigh the evidence as opposed to motive prejudice partiality

accuracy incentive and reliability.

Page 8 of 9

We also draw our attention to the principles laid down in the case of Sunil

Jayaratne vs. Attorney General (2011)2 SLR 91 where it has been held by the

Supreme Court that unless there is some grave miscarriage of justice it would

not be appropriate to interfere with the judgment of the trial judge who enters

judgment after careful consideration of the first hand evidence put before her

to which the Judges of the Appellate Court would not have the ability to

witness.

It has also been held in the cases of King v Endoris 46 NLR 498; Alwis v. Piyasena

Fernando 1993 (1) SLR 119; Fradd v. Brown and Co Ltd: Attorney General v. D.

Senevirathne 1982 (1) SLR 302, No doubt the Court of Appeal has the power

to examine the evidence led before the High Court. However when they go far

as to conduct a demonstration of the evidence, they observe the material

afresh and run the risk of stepping into the role of the original Court. The trial

judge has the unique opportunity to observe evidence in its totality including

the demeanor of the witness. Demeanor represents the trial judges

opportunity to observe the witness and his deportment and it is traditionally

relied on to give the judges findings of fact their rare degree of inviolability. (

Vide, Bingham, The Judge as Juror 1985 p.67)

Hence in the instant case the trial judge had the opportunity of observing the

demeanor and the deportment of witnesses first hand and conclude rather

than us sitting in appeal trying to attribute unnecessary weight to evidence

spoken to by witnesses in trial to fit in to situations which the witnesses may

not have thought of in the actual scenario of events to which they were privy.

Hence it is the opinion of this Court that the Counsel for the petitioner has not

urged any circumstances grave enough to set aside the judgment of the learned

trial judge hence we affirm the judgment of the trial Court.

As such the instant application is dismissed.

I agree.
