ARGUED ON : 10/10/2022

DECIDED ON : 29/11/2022

R. Gurusinghe, J.

The first accused-appellant (the appellant) and two others were indicted in the

High Court of Chilaw for having committed the murder of one Karunapala

Perera at Naththandiya on the 05th of September 2001, an offence punishable

under section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code. The second accused

was dead when the trial commenced. The third accused was acquitted by the

Trial Judge after trial. The first accused was convicted of the murder and

sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the appellant

preferred this appeal to the Court of Appeal.

After the incident, the deceased was admitted to the Marawila hospital, and

later, he was transferredto the Ragama hospital, where he died on admission.

As per the evidence of the defence witness (Milindage Anton Dilruk Fernando),

he heard a noise of two push bicycles crashing together, when he was inside

the boutique reading a news paper. He saw there were four people in the

scene and while one of them was taking out a sword, he came out shouting not

to attack the deceased (page 314). On pages 324 and 325 he testified that the

one who was holding a sword in his hand assaulted the deceased on his head.

He further added that there was a cut injury on the deceased persons head.

The witness and another person then took the deceased to the Marawilla

hospital.

The following points were urged by the Counsel for the appellant, as the

grounds of appeal.

1. The evidence of PW3 was not considered by the learned High Court

Judge.

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to analyse the evidence of PW3

in totality.

3. The dying declaration given to the wife of the deceased (PW4) was not

reliable and should not have been acted upon it.

4. PW4 in her statement to the police and in non-summary deposition

stated that the deceased had said , but in the High

Court, she said that , with the view to implicate the first

and second accused.

The first accused is Liyanage Neil Chaminda, and the second accused was

Jayasinghe Arachige Chaminda Perera.

The evidence of the doctor confirms that the injury on the deceased was

necessarily a fatal injury. The opinion of the doctor was that usually a person

in the position of the deceased, can speak upto a short period of time. On page

258 and 259 he explained that it takes some time for the brain to swell, putting

pressure on the brains stem and inhibiting the breathing process, therefore

the period of time such a person can speak, varies from person to person and it

can range from half an hour to two hours. PW5 said at pages 139 and 140 as

follows:

: ?

.

With regard to the dying declaration, it was argued that the wife of the

deceased (PW4) would have taken considerable time to go to the hospital, and

at the time she went to see the deceased, the deceased was probably not in a

position to speak. Even if he spoke, he was not in a proper sense. PW4

received the information of the incident at 11.00 am. The incident took place

around10.30 am. PW4 was cross-examined by the defence regarding the dying

declaration of the deceased. (On pages 201 and 202) the following questions

were put to her by the defence.

The defence never suggested that the evidence of PW4 regarding the dying

declaration was not true. The difference between Chaminda and Chamindala

was not put to the witness and not marked as a contradiction. If she was

questioned on that point, she would have had an opportunity to explain it.

Section 145 of the evidence ordinance is as follows:

145(1) A witness may be cross-examined as to previous statements made by

him in writing or reduced into writing and relevant to matters in question

without such writing being shown to him, or being proved; but if it is intended

to contradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be

proved, be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of

contradicting him.

145(2) If a witness, upon cross-examination as to a previous oral statement

made by him relevant to matters in question in the suit or proceeding in which

6

he is cross-examined and inconsistence with his present testimony, does not

distinctly admit that he made such statement, proof may be given that he did

in fact make it; but before such proof can be given the circumstances of the

supposed statement sufficient to designate the particular occasion must be

mentioned to the witness, and he must be asked whether or not he made such

a statement.

Without complying with the provisions in section 145 of the Evidence

Ordinance, the defence cannot compare the statement and evidence in court to

say that there are contradictions.

The defence had not taken up the position that the deceased was not in a

position to speak when PW4 visited the deceased at the hospital. This

argument is based on conjectures and cannot be sustained.

Counsel for the appellant argued that the evidence of PW3, the driver of the

three-wheeler, was not considered by the learned Trial Judge.As per the

evidence of PW3, the incident took place around 10.30 am. and there was a

crowd gathered at the crime scene. When he drove slowly near the crowd, the

second accused, who was known as Lokka, got into the three-wheeler. PW3

answered as follows;( at page 153.)

:

?

: .

Then the second accused told him to go forward, and when he proceeded about

400 meters, the first accused, Neil Chaminda, got into the three-wheeler. PW3

7

knew both accused from childhood. The first and third accused were going on a

bicycle at that time. The third accused was riding the bicycle, and the first

accused was sitting on the bicycle. The second accused had asked PW3 to slow

down the three-wheeler. When the three-wheeler slowed down near the bicycle,

the second accused asked the first accused to get into the three-wheeler. At

page 158, PW3 stated as follows:

: 1 ?

:

Counsel for the appellant argued that this piece of evidence should have been

considered in favour of the appellant. However, PW3 said that when the first

accused got down from the three-wheeler, the first accused had a sword, and

at the same time, PW3 categorically said (on page 154) that the second

accused did not have anything in his possession. PW3 further said that the

first and second accused ran after getting down from the three-wheeler. The

three-wheeler was not stopped but only slowed down. The evidence of PW3

does not support the version of the appellant. The evidence of PW3 was that at

the time when the second accused got into the three-wheeler at the place of the

incident, he did not have anything in his possession; PW3 noticed that the

appellant (first accused) had a sword in his possession at the time when he got

down from the three-wheeler. The first accused got into the three-wheeler

about 400 meters away from the place of the incident.

The sword was recovered in consequence of the information of the appellant. As

per the police evidence, the sword was not in a place where it could be easily

recovered if the appellant did not give the information.

Counsel argued that even though the weapon could be found, it was not proved

the connection it had with the first accused. The evidence of PW3 revealed that

8

the first and second accused got down at the closed boutique room where they

stayed. The appellant had the sword in his hand at that time.

The evidence of PW5 revealed that a person with the sword got onto a push

bicycle, and another person rode it away. Within 400 meters, PW3 saw the first

and third accused were going on the push bicycle. The third accused was

riding it. The first accused got into the three-wheeler. When the first accused

got down from the three-wheeler, he had a sword with him.

These items of evidence clearly connect the sword and the appellant. It is

proved beyond reasonable doubt that the first accused-appellant assaulted the

deceased with the sword causing fatal injuries. This injury proved that the

appellant had the intention to kill the deceased even though the learned High

Court Judge has not referred to some items of the evidence. The evidence is

sufficient to justify the conclusion arrived at by the learned High Court Judge.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the dock statement of the

appellant.

The proviso to Article 138 (1) of the Constitution is as follows:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the

Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all

errors in fact or in law which shall be [committed by the High Court, in the

exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of First

Instance], tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by

way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things [of which such High Court, Court of First

Instance] tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgement, decree or order of any court shall be reversed or

varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

10

When considering the evidence of the case as a whole, the evidence proves the

charge against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, I am of the

view that any shortcoming in the judgement has not prejudiced the substantial

rights of the appellant or occasioned a failure of justice.

Considering the above, I see no reason to disturb the conviction and the

sentence imposed on the appellant.

For the above-stated reasons, the appeal is dismissed.
