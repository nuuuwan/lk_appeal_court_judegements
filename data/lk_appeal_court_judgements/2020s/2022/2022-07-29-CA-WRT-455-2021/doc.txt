Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner indicated to Court on 27.10.2021 that

the Petitioners would limit their claim in the instant application only to the reliefs prayed

for in paragraphs (d) and (f) of the prayer of the Petition. Accordingly, the Petitioners are

seeking for a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision to

elect/appoint the 4th Respondent as the President of the Sri Lanka Archery Association

(SLAA) at the purported annual general meeting held on 31.05.2021 pursuant to the

documents marked P17, P17(a) and P17(b). Further, the Petitioners are seeking for a

mandate in the nature of a writ of prohibition restraining the SLAA, inter alia, from

allowing the 4th Respondent to be elected to and/or hold office as the President/any other

posts of SLAA.

The Petitioners pivotal argument is that the 4th Respondent unlawfully assumed office as

the President of the SLAA for years 2019/2021 in violation of Regulation 5(4)(g) of the

Regulations under Sports Law No. 25 of 1973 published in Extraordinary Gazette

Notification 1990/23 on 27.10.2016 (marked P7a). Consequently, the Petitioners argue

that the 4th Respondent in his purported capacity as the President of the SLAA has acted

Page 4 of 9

ultra vires in issuing the notice of Election for the years 2021/2023 (P17 together with

P17a and P17b). Notwithstanding the above, the Petitioners assert that in terms of

Regulation 5(4)(g) of the Regulations under Sports Law No. 25 of 1973 published in

Extraordinary Gazette Notification 2166/9 on 10.03.2020 (marked P16), the 4th

Respondent could not have stood for election for the post of President or any other posts

for the years 2021/2023 of the SLAA Committee since;

a) The 4th Respondent was an office bearer/executive committee member of a

National Association of Sports in respect of which written notice has been issued

under Section 32 of the Sports Law;

b) The 4th Respondent was found to have violated Section 32 of the Sports Law by a

formal committee (the Appeals Consultancy Committee) appointed by the relevant

Minister.

The issues of this case arose with the Minister of Sports (Minister) directing the relevant

secretary to the said Ministry, by his letter dated 27.11.2018 (marked P2), to suspend the

SLAA with effect from 01.12.2018 and to appoint the nominated interim committee on

the basis that the management of the SLAA has acted in a non-cooperative manner. The

Minister has acted accordingly in terms of the powers vested in him under section 32(b) &

33 of the Sports Law No. 25 of 1973, as amended (Sports Law) and his order was

published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2114/47 on 14.03.2019, marked P3.

The said Section 32 which deals with Refusal, suspension and cancellation of registrations

of National Associations of Sports reads:

32. The Minister may refuse registration, or suspend or cancel the registration, of a National

Association of Sports-

(a) for failing or neglecting to remedy any malpractices, misconduct or irregularities on the

part of the office-bearers or members of such Association, on being noticed to do so in writing

by the Secretary to the Ministry within such time as may be specified in such notice; or

(b) for inactivity, non-co-operation or obstruction in the implementation of the policies of the

Ministry;or

(c) for failing to carry out its duties and functions

Page 5 of 9

In this section " Secretary to the Ministry includes the Director of Sports, an Assistant

Director of Sports or an Assistant Secretary to the Ministry.

Admittedly the 4th Respondent was the Vice President of the SLAA at the time of issuing

the above order by the Minister under the said sections 32(b) & 33 of the Sports Law. The

Petitioners bring to the attention of this Court the Regulation 5(4) (g) of the National

Associations of Sports Regulations No. 1 of 2016 (published in Gazette Extraordinary

1990/23 dated 27.10.2016, as amended marked as P7(a) & P7(b)). In terms of the said

Regulation 5(4), a person shall be disqualified from being elected or otherwise to hold or

continue to hold any paid or unpaid office or to hold any paid or unpaid post or to be a

member of a Committee of any National Association of Sports or to be nominee of an

affiliated club or organization in a National Association of Sports, if:-

(g) he has been an office bearer of the Committee of any National Association of

Sports in respect of which, a notice has been issued under section 32 of the Sports

Law for violation of the provisions of the section 32 of the Sports Law;

The Election Committee under the SLAA- Interim Committee announced that the

election of the SLAA 2019/2021 would be held on 21st June 2019. The said Election

Committee received nomination papers for the post of President on behalf of the 4th

Respondent. Accordingly, the 4th Respondent has stood for elections within about six

months from the order of the said Minister under section 32(b) of the Sports Law published

in P3. It is an undisputed fact that following the elections held on 21st June 2019, the 4th

Respondent was elected as the President of the 2019/2021 and assumed duties as well.

It is observed that the above Regulation 5(4) (g) was applicable during the relevant period,

particularly during the election of the SLAA 2019/2021. The said Regulation in

unambiguous language debar a person who is an office bearer of a committee of any

National Association of Sports in respect of which a notice has been issued under Section

32 of the Sports Law, from being elected or to hold office of any National Association of

Sports. Therefore, my considered view is that the 4th Respondent is not entitled to be

elected as the President of 2019/2021 of the SLAA. My said finding is based on;

i. The above provisions of regulation 5(4)(g) &

Page 6 of 9

ii. The undisputed facts that (a) the SLAA has been issued with the said order marked

P3 which is against the said SLAA and (b) the 4th Respondent was an office bearer

of SLAA during the time the said order P3 was issued.

There is another aspect of the arguments raised on behalf of the Petitioners who claim that

the said election was unauthorized. The Petitioners lodged an appeal dated 23.06.2019

(marked P10) with the Minister and in pursuant to such Appeal, the Appeal Objections

Consultancy Committee (Consultancy Committee) comprising of a retired Supreme

Court Judge and two others has examined the said Appeal. The said Committee opined

on 12.07.2019 (P11) that the nomination of the 4th Respondent was unlawful and

recommended to conduct the elections only after rejecting the nominations of the 4th

Respondent and two other candidates. The Petitioners assert that despite repeated efforts

by them to have the said conclusion of the said committee given effect to, no action was

taken in that regard.

The contention of the 4th, 5th, 7th, 9th to 14th Respondents (Respondents) is that the then

Minister has neither made any direction regarding said decision P11 nor has suspended

the SLAA thereafter. It seems to be that it was the only excuse given by the Respondents

for not giving effect to the said conclusion (marked P11) of the said Consultancy

Committee. The opinion and the recommendation of the said Consultancy Committee

perhaps displeased the 4th Respondent or the other authorities of SLAA. However, the

important question which leads to the roots of good governance & principles of the Rule

of Law is on what authority or power the 4th Respondent as a law abiding ordinary person

disregarded the opinion and recommendations of the said Committee. In respect of the

said opinion, at P11, in my view, the 4th Respondent had two reasonable options, namely

(a) to step down with good grace upholding the rule of law or (b) appeal or resist in an

appropriate manner against the said opinion. There is no evidence before this Court to

establish the 4th Respondent taking any such or similar steps.

For the reasons set out above I am of the view that the 4th Respondent and or other

authorities including the Election Committee has violated the conclusions and the

recommendations marked P11, made by the Consultancy Committee. Moreover, not

making any specific direction based on the said P11 by the Minister, in my view, is a

failure on the part of the said Minister.

Page 7 of 9

The Respondents further submit that the Petitioners have failed to apply to this Court by

way of an application of this nature at the time of their grievance. The Respondents

contend that the failure on the part of the Petitioners for not taking prompt action aptly

falls within the established law that recognizes the equitable maxim he who sleeps on his

rights has no remedy. As opposed to such arguments the Petitioners assert that without

any delay they wrote to the Minister by letter dated 20.06.2019 (P9) challenging the

nomination of the 4th Respondent and subsequently, objected to the said nomination at

the 2019/2021 SLAA elective Annual General Meeting. Soon after the elections the

Petitioners preferred the appeal marked P10. Thus, I see no reasons to accept the

proposition of the Respondents that the Petitioners have not sought for the remedy at the

proper instance.

In light of the foregoing, I take the view that accepting the nomination of the 4th

Respondent for the post of President 2019/2021 of the SLAA by the Election Committee

is eminently irrational, unreasonable and is guilty of an illegality. Hence such irrationality,

unreasonableness and illegality eventually outweigh the aforesaid defenses taken up by the

Respondents. In this regard the Petitioners are relying upon the following passage of Lord

Denning in Macfoy vs. United Africa Co. Ltd (1931) 3 ALL ER 1169 (at. 1172);

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad, but incurably bad. There is

no need for an order of the court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void without more

ado, though it is sometimes convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And every

proceeding which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You cannot put something

on nothing and expect it to stay here. It will collapse.

In addition to above the Petitioners are highlighting the amendments brought into the

Regulation 5(4)(g) by virtue of the Gazette Extraordinary No.2166/9 dated 10.03.2020

and the said Gazette notification is marked as P16. Accordingly, the Sections under

5(4)(g) of the Regulations No.1990/23 issued on 27.10.2016 (marked P7a) are repealed

and certain new sections are inserted instead. The amended section (g) in relation to the

said Regulation 5(4) is as follows;

he has been an office bearer of any National Association of Sports, an Executive

Committee member for whom a written notice has been issued under the Section

32 of the Sports Law and has been convicted of violating of the provisions of the

Section 32 (a), (b) and (c) of the Sports Law in an inquiry conducted by a formal

Page 8 of 9

committee appointed by the National Association of Sports, Ministry of Sports or

Department of Sports Development. (Emphasis added)

In view of the above provisions, the Petitioners argue that the conduct on the part of the

4th Respondent to act as President of the SLAA and issue notice of the elective Annual

General Meeting to be held for the 2021/2023 SLAA committee is ultra vires since election

to the post of SLAA President for 2019/2021 is unlawful and also due to the fact that the

4th Respondent has violated P11. Anyhow, the Respondents twisting their arguments in

collaboration with the said amended Regulation 5(4)(g) submit that the Section 32 of the

Sports Law requires the issuance of a written notice under that Section to a person who is

holding a position in the capacity of a member of an Executive Committee upon been

convicted of violating the provisions of the said section. The Respondents argument is

that the notice under the said Section 32 should be issued against the 4th Respondent rather

than issuing such notice against the Sports Body for the 4th Respondent to be disqualified

as mentioned in the Regulation 5(4)(g).

On a careful examination of the said Section 32 and other provisions of the Sports Law, it

emanates that the Minister makes an order under Section 32 against the National

Association of Sports and not against any individual/particular office bearer of such

Association. The P2 evinced that the Minister has issued the said order as the then

management of the SLAA has acted in a non-cooperative manner and it is clear that such

order was not focused on one individual. Although, the provisions of Section 34 are not

directly relevant to this question, the scheme of those provisions are very much apt here.

In terms of Section 34, where the Minister makes an order under Section 32 suspending

the registration of any National Association of Sports, the Secretary to the Ministry of the

Minister may, by notice in writing, require the office-bearers of such Association to deliver

all movable property to the Director of Sports. Any person who fails to comply with any

requirement imposed on him will be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction

to a fine. Therefore, the scheme of the provisions of the said Section is that all the office

bearers are collectively responsible and are directly bound by an order of the Minister

issued under Section 32. Thus, I cannot accept the argument of the Respondents that a

notice under said Section 32 should be served individually to an office bearer in order to

make him disqualified under the said Regulation 5(4)(g).

Page 9 of 9

Hence, I am inclined to accept the assertions of the Petitioners that the 4th Respondents

election and/or appointment to the post of President of SLAA for 2019/2021 is illegal and

any act flowing therefrom is ultra vires, null and void. In light of the above, I take the view

that the SLAA is not entitled to allow the 4th Respondent to be elected and/or to hold

office in SLAA as a President and/or by way of any other posts and/or to be a member of

the committee of the SLAA in view of P17, P17a and P17b.

In the circumstances, I proceed to issue a writ of Certiorari as prayed for in paragraph (d)

of the prayer of the Petition and also issue a writ of Prohibition as prayed for in paragraph

(f) of the prayer of the Petition.
