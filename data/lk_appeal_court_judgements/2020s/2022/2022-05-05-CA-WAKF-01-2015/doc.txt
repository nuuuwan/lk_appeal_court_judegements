MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

These appeals have been preferred against the judgement of the Wakfs

Tribunal dated 21.03.2015. Of consent, these appeals have been consolidated.

There are several grounds of appeal set out in the petitions of appeal filed by

the Appellant. However, at the argument of these appeals, the learned Counsel

for the Appellants confined the argument only to the question of law which is

delineated as follows;

Whether the impugned judgment of the Wakfs Tribunal dated

21.03.2015 is liable to be set aside in limine, on the basis that the Wakf

Tribunal failed to adhere to the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code

in terms of section 9G of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or

Wakfs Act, No. 51 of 1956 (as amended).

It is the contention of the learned Counsel for the Appellants that in terms of

section 9G of the said Act, the Wakf Tribunal shall follow the procedure of a

District Court with regard to the inquiries and trials. In the instant case, the

Tribunal totally failed to adhere to the said section, and therefore, all the

proceedings before the Tribunal in relation to these appeals are bad in law and

liable to be set aside in limine.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the Respondents was that, in terms

of section 9G of the said Act, the Tribunal shall follow the procedure of a

District Court only pertaining to the execution of its orders and judgments and

the Tribunal is not bound to adopt the procedure in a District Court as to the

inquiries and trials. The learned Counsel for the Respondents further

contended that the foregoing preliminary legal objection cannot be

perpetuated on the footing that the Appellants either have not taken up such

an objection before the Tribunal or set out such a ground of appeal in the

petitions of appeal.

Page 9 of 11

Section 9G of the Muslim Mosques and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act, No. 51

of 1956 (as amended) reads thus;

In any proceedings under this Act, the Tribunal shall follow the

procedure of a District Court, and in the execution of its orders and

judgments, shall have all the powers of a District Court and the

provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, relating to the procedures and

powers of execution of a District Court, shall mutatis mutandis, apply

to and in relation to the procedures and powers of execution of the

Tribunal.

Having scrutinized the said section 9G of the said Act, the following matters

have been clarified without any ambiguity.

(1) The Tribunal shall follow the procedure of a District Court in respect of

all the proceedings.

(2) The Tribunal shall have all the powers of a District Court in respect of

the execution of its orders and judgments in accordance with the

provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.

According to Section 9G of the Act, it is apparent that the Tribunal is obliged

to follow the procedure of a District Court and is vested with the power to

enforce its decisions as provided for in the Civil Procedure Code. Every order

made by the Tribunal shall be deemed to be an order made by a District Court

and the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code governing appeals from orders

and Judgments of a District Court shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to and in

relation to appeals from orders of the Wakfs Tribunal.

In Shahul Hameed and Others v. Aliyar and Others, CA/Wakfs/01/2011, CA

Minutes of 26.06.2013, Salam, J. (agreeing with Ani Gooneratne and Sisire de

Abrew JJ.), at page 7 echoed the same sentiments as follows:

Certain decisions of the Wakfs Board including an order of

confirmation and appointment of trustees of a Mosque are appealable

to the Wakfs Tribunal. The Members of the Tribunal are appointed by

Page 10 of 11

the Judicial Service Commission. The Tribunal is obliged to follow the

procedure of a District Court and is vested with the power to enforce its

decisions as provided for in the Civil Procedure Code.

Every order made by the Tribunal shall be deemed to be an order made

by a District Court and the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code

governing appeals from orders and judgments of a District Court shall,

mutatis mutandis, apply to and in relation to appeals from orders of the

Tribunal.

Moreover, for the purposes of dealing with offences of contempt against the

authority of the Tribunal, the provisions of Section 55 of the Judicature Act,

No. 2 of 1978, shall, mutatis mutandis, apply as though the references therein

to a District Court were references to the Tribunal (vide sections 55A and 55B

of the Act).

As such, to my mind, the argument advanced by the learned Counsel for the

Respondent stating that the Tribunal is bound to follow the Civil Procedure

Code only with regard to the execution of its orders and judgments is devoid

of merits.

Admittedly, in the instant case, the Tribunal has not adhered to the provisions

of the Civil Procedure Code in conducting the inquiry/trial in dispute. The

pleadings were not filed in accordance with the Civil Procedure Code and the

inquiry/trial was not held as per the provisions of the said Code. In these

respects, it is manifestly clear that the impugned judgment of the Wakf

Tribunal is illegal and bad in law. As such, it is the considered view of this

Court that the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside on that ground alone.

The aforesaid ground of appeal advanced by the learned Counsel for the

appellants is a pure question of law, and therefore, the same can be taken up

in appeal at any time though this issue was not raised before the Tribunal and

not set out in the petitions of appeal.

For the above reasons, I allow the appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 15,000/ and

set aside the judgment of the Wakf Tribunal dated 21.03.2015.

Page 11 of 11

I direct the Wakf Tribunal to hold an Inquiry/Trial de novo in accordance with

the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code read with section 9G of the Muslim

Mosques and Charitable Trust or Wakfs Act No. 51 of 1956 (as amended).

Appeal allowed.
