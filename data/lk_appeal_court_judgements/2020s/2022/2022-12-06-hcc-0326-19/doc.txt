WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The accused-appellant along with the two others was indicted before

the High Court of Colombo for Trafficking 22.54 grams of heroin, an

offence punishable under Section 54A(b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. The first and the second accused died

before the commencement of the trial. Accordingly, the trial proceeded

against the third accused. After the trial, he was convicted and

sentenced to death by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo by

his judgment dated 21st August 2019. The third accused preferred

this appeal against the said conviction and the sentence.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions have been filed on behalf of

both parties. The learned Counsel for the appellant and the learned

Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent made oral submissions at

the hearing of this appeal.

The prosecution case may be briefly summarized as follows:

On November 26, 2007, PW1, a Police Narcotic Bureau officer,

received information from a reliable private informant about a group of

people transporting heroin in a three-wheeler. According to the

information; Melani Kumari, her son, and her brother, the accused-

appellant in this case, are transporting narcotics in a three-wheeler

bearing the registration number QL-1691. Accordingly, PW1 organized

a team for a raid comprised of Police Narcotics Bureau officers, who

arrived at the Kochchikade church around 6 a.m. in an official van.

They met the informant who had provided information. The team had

arrived in Mattakkuliya and parked their van at the Mattakkuliya

petrol shed. The three police officers, PW1, PW3, and WPC 2290-

Thilini, got down from the van and stayed outside the road, observing

the road. After a short while, a three-wheeler with the same

registration number given by the informant came from the direction of

Samagipura. They stopped the three-wheeler.

Apart from the driver, there were two passengers inside the three-

wheeler. PW1 had then searched the lady with a handbag in the

passengers seat. Inside the bag, there were two yellow colour covers

containing a brown colour substance. SI Kumara identified the

substance as heroin after opening one of the covers. Then, she was

arrested after explaining the offence committed by her. She is the first

accused in this case. The son of the woman seated next to her was

also arrested for aiding and abetting to traffic heroin. He is the second

accused in the case. The third accused-appellant, who drove the

three-wheeler, was the first accused woman's brother.

Following that, PW1 directed the PW4 to search the three-wheeler.

He obtained keys from the accused-appellant, the driver. PW4 then

opened the cubbyhole that was in front of the driving seat and

detected 5 similar yellow color covers, a scale, and 4 weights inside.

PW1 noticed powder traces on the scale as well. The recovered items

4

were subsequently sent to the Government Analyst for examination.

PW1, the main investigating officer and PW4 have given evidence

about the raid at the trial.

The defence position suggested to the PW1 was that a woman called

Srimathi had been arrested in another raid on the same day when

she was in a three-wheeler (not the appellants three-wheeler) and

heroin found on her was implicated to the appellant. However, when

the appellant made a dock statement, he stated that the said

Srimathi and two other friends were in the three-wheeler driven by

him, they were arrested and taken to the Borella police station.

According to the appellant, his sister (first accused) and her son

(second accused) were also arrested when they were in the house and

then they were also brought to the police station. In the police station,

heroin was introduced to them as well as to the Srimathi, the

appellant said in his dock statement. It is very clear that the position

suggested to the main investigating officer and the position taken up

by the appellant in his dock statement are totally contradictory.

Therefore, the learned High Court Judge very correctly rejected these

completely contradictory and unreliable two versions of the defence.

Although the defence versions are rejected, the prosecution case

would not succeed. The prosecution has to prove its case beyond a

reasonable doubt.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the appellant

confined his arguments to the issue of the appellant's knowledge of

the offence although three grounds of appeal have been stated in the

appellant's written submissions. Accordingly, the learned Deputy

Solicitor General also made submissions only with regard to the said

ground of appeal.

The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant was that even if

the prosecution version that her sister, the first accused, was found

5

with heroin in the three-wheeler is accepted, the appellant had no

knowledge that heroin was in the three-wheeler. Therefore, this court

has to deal only with this issue of knowledge.

In considering the issue of knowledge, the accused-appellant had no

burden to establish his lack of knowledge. To establish the trafficking

charge against the appellant, the prosecution must prove that the

appellant transported the heroin with the knowledge that the first

accused, who was traveling in his three-wheeler, was in possession of

heroin.

Although new story was narrated in the dock statement that

Srimathi and two other friends were in the three-wheeler at the time

of the raid, during the prosecution case, the appellants position was

that Srimathi came in another three-wheeler and her heroin was

implicated to them. It was not even suggested on behalf of the

appellant in cross-examining PW1 and PW4, that the first accused

was not in his three-wheeler at the time of the raid. Detecting two

heroin parcels in the handbag carried by the first accused was also

not challenged. The unchallenged evidence of the Government Analyst

also established that the pure quantity of heroin she possessed was

22.54 grams. In addition, finding the weighing scale, four weights and

five similar yellow covers from the cubbyhole has also not been

challenged by the defence in cross-examination.

An observation of the Indian judgment of Sarvan Singh v. State of

Punjab (2002 AIR SC (iii) 3652) at pages 3655 and 3656, has been

cited in the case of Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Premachandra v. The

Hon. Attorney General C.A. Case No. 79/2011, decided on 04.04.2017

as follows: It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent

has declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in

cross-examination, it must follow that the evidence tendered on that

issue ought to be accepted.

In the case of Himachal Pradesh v. Thakur Dass (1983) 2 Cri. L. J.

1694 at 1701 V. D. Misra CJ held that whenever a statement of fact

made by a witness is not challenged in cross-examination, it has to be

concluded that the fact in question is not disputed. Similarly, in

Motilal v. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) Criminal Law Journal NOC

125 MP, it was held that absence of cross-examination of prosecution

witness of certain facts, leads to inference of admission of that fact.

In evaluating the evidence to determine whether appellants knowledge

has been established, the crux of the aforesaid judicial authorities

should be taken in to consideration.

Also, it is to be noted that issue of knowledge has to be determined by

facts. The learned High Court Judge has considered the facts and

circumstances of the case and held that the appellant had the

knowledge. It has been held in several cases such as King Vs.

Gunaratne 14 Ceylon Law Recorder 174, Fradd Vs. Brown & Company

20 NLR 282 at 283, State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. M. K. Anthony (1984)

SCJ 236/(1985) CRI L.J. 493 at 498/499, Oliver Dayananda

Kalansuriya alias Raja Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka CA 28/2009

(13.02.2013), Wickramasuriya V. Dedolina (1996) 2 Sri L.R. 95, and

Alwis V. Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 Sri L.R. 119 at 122, that the

testimonial trustworthiness of witnesses is a matter for trial Judge

and a considered finding of a trial Judge will not be disturbed by an

Appellate Court lightly.

In the instant case, the learned High Court Judge has carefully

considered and evaluated all of the evidence presented and given

reasons for his findings. However, in light of the arguments advanced

on behalf of both parties in this court, this court must consider

whether it is needed to be interfered with those findings.

7

In order to substantiate the appellants lack of knowledge on the

offence of trafficking, the learned counsel for the appellant submitted

the judgment of V. Sivadasan & V. Pavadasan V. The Attorney General

- CA 46/2008 decided on 13.07.2012. In this case, the second

accused brother who had been with the first accused who was

convicted for trafficking heroin was acquitted by the Court of Appeal

for the reason that the second accused cannot be convicted for the

offence committed by the first accused simply because he is the

brother of the first accused. The learned counsel contended that in the

case before us also, the third accused-appellant cannot be convicted

because of the reason that he was the brother of the first accused.

It should be noted that even in the instant action, the learned High

Court Judge has taken the same view. The learned Judge has stated

in his judgment that the accuseds sister may have traveled with

heroin in the accuseds three-wheeler without informing him about

the heroin. However, the learned trial Judge was of the view that the

facts, that a weighing scale with traces of heroin was discovered in a

locked compartment of the three-wheeler and the way the appellant

reacted when he saw the police officers completely exclude the

inference of innocence of the appellant.

In the aforesaid Court of Appeal case, two brothers were indicted on

the basis that they had jointly committed the offences under sections

54A (b) and 54A (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance. Police arrested the two brothers when they came out from

a Kovil while the first accused was carrying a parcel allegedly

containing heroin. The second accused attempted to prevent the

arrest of the first accused. The Court of Appeal held that they had a

right to be together as brothers and that there was nothing unusual.

Also, it was held that the second accused came to rescue the first

accused, and although it may be highly suspicious that the second

8

accused too had the knowledge but suspicion however great will not

constitute evidence.

The facts of that case differ from the facts of the case before us. In the

aforementioned case, the second accused possessed nothing; he was

with his brother and he only attempted to rescue his brother. In the

case before us, when PW1 searched the first accused's handbag, two

yellow color covers containing heroin were found. So, the first accused

who possessed with heroin was traveling in the three-wheeler driven

by the appellant. Hence, it is apparent that the heroin was

transported in the appellants three-wheeler. The only issue is the

appellants knowledge. If he had knowledge, the offence of trafficking

is committed because according to the interpretation in section 54A of

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, transport is one

of the modes of trafficking.

Anyhow, in this case also, as in the aforesaid case, the appellant

cannot be convicted of an offence for heroin found from the custody of

the first accused merely because the appellant and the first accused

were brothers and sisters.

However, it should be noted that although close relationships such as

brother and sister or husband and wife are immaterial in proving

certain criminal charges, they are material in establishing knowledge

because close relations have ample opportunities to know what each

other is doing. Therefore, this close relationship is also a relevant

factor in ascertaining the knowledge but the remote possibility that

the sister was taken in the appellants three-wheeler without being

aware of the heroin she possessed should not be overlooked. Hence, in

addition to the brother-sister relationship, there must be other

circumstances to come to the only conclusion that the appellant had

the knowledge of the offence.

9

The learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that the appellants

knowledge has been well established in this case because five similar

yellow colour covers, a scale with trace of heroin, and four weights

have been recovered from the cubbyhole of the appellants three-

wheeler.

It is apparent from the evidence in this case, the brother-sister

relationship is not the only factor in establishing knowledge. The

cubbyhole was placed in front of the driving seat of the three-wheeler.

The cubbyhole was locked and the keys were with the appellant. PW4

has obtained the keys from the appellant to open and check the

cubbyhole. So, what was found in the cubbyhole should be considered

to have been in the possession of the appellant. However, as learned

counsel for the appellant pointed out, the appellant was indicted not

for the items discovered in the cubbyhole, but for trafficking the

heroin possessed by the first accused.

When the cubbyhole was opened, using the key in the appellant's

possession, a weighing scale was discovered, and the Government

Analyst confirmed that traces of heroin were found on the scale. In

addition, five other yellow colour bags similar to the two yellow colour

bags containing heroin that the sister was carrying were found in the

cubbyhole. This is strong evidence of appellants knowledge regarding

the heroin possessed by his sister. There was no any explanation from

the appellant to get an inference that the first accused possessed

heroin without his knowledge when she traveled in his three-wheeler.

Especially, the appellant failed to explain how, similar yellow colour

bags to the yellow colour bags containing heroin possessed by his

sister came to the cubbyhole. Taking all of the facts and

circumstances into account, I hold that it is established beyond a

reasonable doubt that the appellant transported the heroin knowing it

was in the three-wheeler. Hence, the learned High Court Judge is

10

correct in coming to his conclusions on the basis that the appellant

had knowledge of transporting heroin, I hold.

The learned counsel for the appellant did not canvas the sentence

imposed on the appellant. This offence carries only two punishments;

life imprisonment or the death sentence. For the reasons stated by the

learned High Court Judge in sentencing, I hold that the sentence is

lawful and correct in principle.

Accordingly, the conviction and sentence imposed on the accused-

appellant are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
