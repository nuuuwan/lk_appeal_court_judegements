FTO obtains the services of ASTL to fulfil their contractual obligation towards their customers, the tourists. Accordingly, FTO enters into an agreement with ASTL to provide the aforesaid services to the tourists, in Sri Lanka. FTO pays ASTL for the services provided by ASTL to the foreign tourist, keeping a profit margin. The Appellant did not challenge the above position of the Respondent. The Appellant, in point 2, paragraph 2 of his reasons for the determination, concedes that FTO arrange vacations for tourists, collect a total cost of the tour with a profit margin and issue invoices to the tourists. It was also admitted that the profit margin is agreed between FTO and ASTL, beforehand. The Appellant also stated in point 2, paragraph 3 that ASTL issue invoices to FTO for the costs incurred by ASTL for the tourist with the profit margin and receive the total amount in foreign currency through banks.",

One contract was between Plantiflor and its customer by which Plantiflor sold their goods to the customer and the other contract was between Plantiflor and Parcelforce by which Plantiflor made the necessary arrangements to have its customers' goods delivered. There was no third contract between Parcelforce and the customer. The customer's agreement to pay postal charges was made with Plantiflor and not with Parcelforce. Thus, in here, Parcelforce made two different supplies. One was the supply to Plantiflor's customer of the service of delivering his goods to his order, and the other was the supply to Plantiflor of the service of delivering its customer's goods to the addressee. It was held that Parcelforce does not deliver the goods pursuant to any contract with the customer and it makes delivery pursuant to its contract with Plantiflor, which both parties entered into as principals.",

He observed that prior to the year of assessment 2010/2011 ASTL paid income tax at the concessionary rate of 15% in terms of Section 46 of the IR Act and thereafter, claimed exemption under Section 13 (dddd). In reply, the Respondent submitted that Section 13 (dddd) was introduced by amendment Act No. 19 of 2009 with effect from 31st of March 2009 and thereafter only ASTL could claim the exemption under Section 13 (dddd). I am inclined to accept the explanation offered by the Respondent and therefore, the Assessors observation that there is a duplicity in tax treatment by ASTL has no merit.",
