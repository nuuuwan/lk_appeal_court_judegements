WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The first and second accused-appellants were indicted in the High

Court of Embilipitiya on the following counts.

I. On or about 02.08.2015, in Ulliduwawa Kollonna, committed

the offence of abduction of the Pathiranage Jayanthilatha, an

offence punishable in terms of Section 357 of the Penal Code

read with Section 32.

3

II. The first accused, in the course of the same transaction,

committed gang rape on the said Pathiranage Jayanthilatha and

thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of Section

364(2) of the Penal Code.

III. The second accused, in the course of the same transaction,

aided and abetted the first accused to commit gang rape and

thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 364(2)

of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge found the accused-appellants

guilty for the charges against them. Accordingly, both of them were

sentenced to a term of 2 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of

Rs.5,000/-, carrying a default term of 6 months of simple imprisonment

for the first count. The first accused was sentenced to a term of 12 years

of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/-, carrying a default

term of 6 months of simple imprisonment for the second count. The

second accused was also sentenced to a term of 12 years of rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/-, carries a default term of 6

months of simple imprisonment for the third count. Both accused were

ordered to pay a sum of Rs.150,000/- each as compensation to the

victim, which carrying a default term of 1-year simple imprisonment.

This appeal is preferred against the said convictions and sentences.

Written submissions on behalf of both parties have been filed prior to

the hearing. At the hearing, the learned counsel for the first appellant,

the learned counsel for the second appellant, and the learned Deputy

Solicitor General for the respondent made oral submissions.

According to the prosecution, the following are the facts of the case,

briefly:

The prosecutrix (PW-1) in this case was a 43-year-old married woman

who lived with her husband at the time of the offence. On the day of the

4

incident, between 1.30 a.m. and 2.00 a.m., she was returning home

from her niece's puberty ceremony, which was about a 10-minute walk

from her house. She went to the ceremony with her husband, but she

returned home alone. According to PW-1, the first and second accused

followed her while she was returning, and the second accused held her

by the waist and the first accused dragged her to a nearby tea plot, then

they raped her.

At the hearing, the learned counsel for the 1st appellant as well as the

learned counsel for the 2nd appellant advanced their arguments on the

following three grounds:

I. The 1st and 2nd appellants have not been properly identified.

II. PW-1, the prosecutrix is not a credible witness.

III. The learned High Court Judge has not considered the burden of

proof in a proper perspective.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent contended that

although there were minor flaws in the prosecution evidence, all three

charges against the accused-appellants have been proved beyond a

reasonable doubt.

After the prosecution case, the 1st accused-appellant as well as the 2nd

accused-appellant gave evidence and presented the defence version.

The learned High Court Judge has decided that the defence version

cannot be accepted, because the position taken up by the defence has

not been suggested to the prosecution witnesses. The failure to suggest

the defence version to the prosecution witnesses is a reason not to

accept the defence version. The said finding of the learned High Court

Judge is correct. However, the learned High Court Judge has stated in

her judgment that when the test of probability is applied, the

prosecution version is more probable than the defence version. One of

the arguments of the learned counsel for the 1st appellant was that the

standard considered by the learned trial Judge regarding the burden of

5

proof is incorrect. I agree that there is merit in that argument because,

when it is stated that the prosecution version is more probable, it

implies that there is some sort of probability in the defence version as

well. If there is some probability in the defence version, that would

create reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. In such a situation,

the accused is entitled to be acquitted. As decided in P.P. Jinadasa V.

The Attorney General C.A. 17/2009, not the defence evidence, but

even an unsworn statement from the dock is sufficient for the defence

to succeed, if it raises a reasonable doubt in the mind of the Court about

the prosecution case.

Therefore, an unacceptable defence version does not relieve the

prosecution duty to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt. It

was held in Karunadasa V. OIC Motor Traffic Division, Police Station,

Nittambuwa (1987) 1 Sri L.R. 155, that The weakness of the defence

must not be allowed to bolster up a weak case for the prosecution. The

evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence. His

innocence is presumed by the law and his guilt must be established

beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, it was held in Kamal Addaraarachchi

V. State (2000) 3 Sri L. R. 393 that It is an imperative requirement in

a criminal case that the prosecution case must be convincing no matter

how weak the defence is before a court is entitled to convict an accused.

what the court has done in this case is to bolster up a weak case for the

prosecution by referring to the weakness in the defence case- that

cannot be permitted: the prosecution must establish its case beyond

reasonable doubt.

Therefore, in the instant action, it has to be considered whether the

prosecution has adduced evidence to prove the charges against the

appellants beyond a reasonable doubt. The main argument advanced

by both learned counsel for the appellants was that the appellants'

identities had not been established. Before considering the other issues,

6

I wish to deal with the issue of identity because if the appellants have

not been properly identified, all three charges against them would fail.

Undisputedly, only the prosecutrix has given evidence about the

incident. Accordingly, the identities of the appellants also have to be

established by the evidence of the prosecutrix. In her evidence, PW-1

has stated that the 2nd accused had held her by her waist and the 1st

accused dragged her to a nearby tea plot. Thereafter, she stated that

they raped her. However, apart from the aforesaid acts done by the 1st

and 2nd appellants before raping her, she has not stated specifically

what sexual act has been done by the 1st appellant and what sexual act

has been done by the 2nd appellant. Furthermore, at the time of the

rape, she did not claim to have identified the appellants visually as the

perpetrators. In re-examination, she was asked

? Her answer was, by their

voices () (Page 107 of the appeal brief). Therefore, at no

occasion, she visually identified the appellants.

Even though she stated that the aforesaid acts of holding her by the

waist and dragging her to a nearby tea plot were done by the 2nd and

1st appellants, when she was questioned, she categorically stated that

she identified the appellants by their voices. (The said items of evidence

are found at pages 61, 95, and 107 of the appeal brief) In addition, she

stated that there was no light and that it was extremely dark (pages 94

and 95 of the appeal brief). That evidence makes it clearer that visual

identification was not possible. Therefore, it is apparent that there was

no visual identification in this case but only voice identification.

According to PW-1, an incident occurred during the puberty ceremony

between her and the appellants. The learned Deputy Solicitor General

raised the argument that the subsequent act of following her and raping

her was a continuation of the previous incident in the puberty

ceremony, and thus she had no difficulty in identifying the appellants.

I regret that I am unable to agree with that argument because she stated

7

that she did not see these two appellants coming when she left the

house where the puberty ceremony was held. ( .

, .

.

. Page 60 of the appeal brief). Therefore, it is apparent

that the subsequent act was not a continuation of the previous act. As

such, their identification at the puberty ceremony does not help to

establish their involvement in the events pertaining to the charges.

In perusing the judgment, it is clear that the main reason for accepting

the voice identification evidence by the learned High Court Judge is that

the defence has not challenged the said evidence. Firstly, it is to be

noted that according to PW-1, the 1st appellant has not uttered even a

single word. So, it is evident that the 1st appellant could not be identified

by voice. Therefore, the necessity did not arise for the 1st appellant to

challenge voice identification. Anyhow, when the PW-1 was cross-

examined on behalf of the 1st appellant as well as the 2nd appellant, she

was questioned about the way that she identified the appellants while

suggesting that the appellants had been wrongly implicated for the

offence committed by someone else. So, the voice identification has in

fact been challenged on behalf of both appellants. Apart from that, it is

to be noted that it is a fundamental duty of the prosecution to prove the

identities of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt in proving the

charges against the accused. Hence, the learned trial Judges decision

to accept the voice identification evidence for the reason of not

challenging the said evidence is incorrect. When the prosecution

evidence regarding the facts of the incidents relating to the case is not

challenged by the accused, it leads to the inference of admission of that

fact. Unlike the other incidents of a case, I am of the view that

identification of the accused in a criminal case must be proved beyond

a reasonable doubt by the prosecution, whether the evidence

regarding the identification is challenged or not. Anyhow, this issue

8

does not arise in the case at hand because the voice identification

evidence, in this case, has been challenged on behalf of the appellants.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General contended further that the

medical evidence and the evidence of the police witnesses corroborate

the evidence of the prosecutrix. That corroborative evidence may help

to establish that a rape or a gang rape had occurred. However, the

medical evidence or the evidence of police witnesses would not

corroborate the prosecutrixs evidence regarding the appellants

identities.

Also, the learned DSG contended that there was no reason for PW-1 to

falsely implicate the appellants to this incident. That could be correct.

The issue of this case is not whether she falsely implicated the

appellants in this incident. The issue is whether PW-1's voice

identification is reliable.

In the circumstances, it is to be considered whether the appellants were

identified beyond a reasonable doubt by PW-1 by their voices. As stated

previously, the 1st appellant had not uttered a single word according to

PW-1s evidence. Even at a later stage, while doing some sexual act or

subsequently, PW-1 has not stated that the 1st appellant uttered

anything. She stated about only the words uttered by the 2nd appellant

(page 95 of the appeal brief) and said she identified both appellants by

their voices. Hence, it is evident that under any circumstances, the 1st

appellant could not be identified by his voice because he did not utter

even a word according to her evidence. Therefore, 1st appellants

involvement regarding any of the acts pertaining to the charges has not

been proved. Therefore, the 1st and 2nd counts against the 1st appellant

fail.

Against the 2nd accused-appellant, the first and third charges have been

brought. When PW-1 stated in her evidence that both appellants raped

9

her, the following portion of her statement to the police had been

marked as a contradiction (V-3):

(Page 96 of the appeal brief).

Maybe because of this statement, the 2nd appellant had not been

charged for committing the rape. The 3rd charge against the 2nd accused

for committing the gang rape, punishable under Section 364(2) has

been brought on the basis that he has aided and abetted the 1st accused

in committing the rape because according to Explanation-1 to Section

364 of the Penal Code Where the offence of rape is committed by one or

more person in a group of persons, each person in such group committing

or abetting the commission of such offence is deemed to have committed

gang rape.

However, in the case at hand, it has already been decided that the 1st

appellant cannot be convicted for the offence of rape or gang rape as he

has not been identified. Therefore, the 3rd charge brought against the

2nd appellant for aiding and abetting the 1st appellant to commit rape

also necessarily fails.

Now, only the 1st charge against the 2nd appellant has to be considered.

PW-1 stated that the 2nd appellant uttered the words

, (Page 61 of the appeal brief) when they came behind

her. It is not clear why he stated Dont shout, dont tell while he was

going behind her. Anyhow, PW-1 stated that she identified the 2nd

appellant by hearing those words.

At this stage, it is important to consider the legal position regarding

voice identification. In considering the substance of the line of judicial

authorities in respect of voice identification, it is clear that the court

can act upon voice identification evidence, but stringent precautions

should be taken in accepting voice identification evidence.

In the case of Mohan @ Mohan Singh V. State of U.P. High Court of

Judicature at Allahabad - Criminal Appeal No. - 871 of 1996, decided

10

on 27 May 2020 that The evidence led by the prosecution must be

cogent, positive, affirmative and assertive and must establish beyond

all reasonable doubts that the witness had ability to identify voice and

additionally there was sufficient opportunity for the witness to identify

the assailant by voice only.

It was held in the case of Pratap Singh V. State of M.P- in Criminal

Appeal No.00601 of 2004, decided on 17.5.2017; that Accurate voice

identification is much more difficult than visual identification. The

Courts have to be extremely cautious in basing conviction purely on the

evidence of voice identification. The ability of the individual to identify

voice in general and the familiarity of the listener with the known voice;

and even a confident recognition of a familiar voice by a listener, must

be established beyond all reasonable doubts by cogent, positive,

affirmative and assertive evidence.

Also, in Rohan Taylor and Others V. R- SCCA Nos. 50-53/1991, it was

held that In order for the evidence of a witness that he recognized an

accused person by his voice to be accepted as cogent, there must, we

think, be evidence of the degree of familiarity the witness had with the

accused and his voice and including the prior opportunities the witness

may have had to hear the voice of the accused. The occasion when

recognition of the voice occurs, must be such that there were sufficient

words used as to make recognition of that voice safe on which to act

Evidence reveals in this case that the appellants were known people to

PW-1. According to PW-1, the 2nd appellant uttered about five words.

Therefore, it has to be considered whether these words were sufficient

to recognize his voice. Also, PW-1s evidence must be cogent, positive,

and affirmative to accept her voice identification evidence.

Now, I have to consider whether PW-1s evidence is cogent. PW-1s

husband has given evidence in this case as the 2nd witness for the

11

prosecution. Regarding PW-1's return from the puberty ceremony, her

husband PW-2 stated that when he returned home, he saw PW-1 had

fallen on the ground outside the house. PW-1 has given totally

contradictory evidence regarding this matter. She stated that her

husband, PW-2, was at home when she returned home. Furthermore,

she has never stated that she fell outside the house. When considering

the evidence of these two witnesses, it is difficult to ascertain whether

PW-1's evidence should be believed, PW-2's evidence should be

believed, or both witnesses' evidence should be disbelieved on this

point.

When PW-1 stated in her evidence that both appellants raped her, she

was questioned whether she has stated to the police I dont know

whether the person called Suranga alias Ruwan who came with

Chinthaka harassed me. She had denied saying so and the said portion

stated to the police has been marked as a contradiction at page 96 of

the appeal brief as mentioned before. In considering this vital

contradiction, her credibility is called into question when she claims

during her testimony in the High Court that the 2nd appellant also raped

her.

Apart from that, when she was suggested that if she had sexual

intercourse, it was with Amith Priyantha, she has not denied the

suggestion. Her answer was .

(Page 103 of the appeal brief). Again, when

she was suggested that she made a false complaint to protect Amith

Priyantha, she replied . .

(Page 106 of the appeal brief). She

cannot be considered a credible witness when she stated in one

instance of her evidence like this and stated with certainty in another

instance that both appellants raped her. Furthermore, her statement

"don't know whether these two were also allowed to do" implies that

another person or people were involved in this incident. These answers,

12

on the other hand, demonstrate that she was not sure as to who raped

her, although she stated that both appellants raped her.

Already, this court has decided that the 1st and 2nd counts against the

1st appellant and the 3rd count against the 2nd appellant have not been

proved. Only the 1st count against the 2nd appellant remains to be

considered. As the aforesaid items of evidence of PW-1 create doubt

about her credibility, her evidence cannot be considered as cogent

evidence. Hence, I am of the view that it is unsafe to convict the 2nd

appellant for the 1st count on the voice identification evidence of PW-1.

Therefore, I hold that the 1st charge against the 2nd appellant has also

not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the learned High Court Judges

decision to convict the appellants for the charges against them is bad

in law. Therefore, I quash the convictions of both appellants. The

judgment dated 28.04.2021 and the sentences of imprisonment, fines

imposed, on the 1st and 2nd appellants, and the order made on

compensation are set aside. The 1st accused-appellant is acquitted of

charges one and two. The 2nd accused-appellant is acquitted of charges

one and three.

The appeals of the 1st and 2nd appellants are allowed.
