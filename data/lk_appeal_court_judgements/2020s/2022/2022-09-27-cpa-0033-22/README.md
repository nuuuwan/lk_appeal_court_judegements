Iddawala J

The accused-petitioner (hereinafter the petitioner) sought to issue formal

notice to the respondent and supported his application on 08.09.2022.

The order was reserved for notice. The main contention for determination

by this Court is whether the petitioner has established prima facie

exceptional circumstances for this Court to issue formal notice on the

respondents.

The petitioner was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for allegations

under Section 19(b) and (c) of the Bribery Act No. 11 of 1954 as amended

in Case No HCB/24/2018. The trial commenced on 05.10.2020, and on

14.02.2022, an objection was raised against the maintainability of the

action against the petitioner. The said objection was based on the

pronouncements in Anoma Polwatte v Director General, Commission

to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) SC/WRIT

Application 01/2011 SC Minute dated 26.07.2018 (hereinafter the Anoma

Polwatte case) and Kesara Senanayake v Attorney General [2010] 1 SLR

149 and the petitioner sought to impugn the indictment served by the

Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery

or Corruption (hereinafter the CIABOC). The learned High Court Judge

CPA 33-22 Page 3 of 8 27/09/2022 IJ-38-22

dismissed the objection by his order dated 14.02.2022. Aggrieved by the

said pronouncement, the petitioner has preferred the instant revisionary

application to the Court of Appeal.

During the oral submissions, the counsel for the petitioner submitted that

he had already exhausted the Writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

under Article 140 of the Constitution read with Section 24(1) of the

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19

of 1994 (as amended) (hereinafter the Commission Act). It was further

submitted that the Supreme Court refused to issue notice in the Writ

petition based on a technical failure, on the basis that the petitioner has

failed to produce evidence of the administrative act sought to be quashed

in relation to the impugned decision of the CIABOC. The counsel appraised

this Court that by the time the Writ petition was supported before the

Supreme Court, the instant revision application was already filed before

the Court of Appeal under and in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution

and that the existence of same has been intimated to the Supreme Court

at the time. In clarifying the two avenues the petitioner has sought in this

regard, the counsel contended that with the invocation of the Supreme

Courts Writ jurisdiction, he sought to quash an administrative decision of

the CIABOC. The counsel asserted that on the contrary, he is invoking the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 138 of the

Constitution on the basis that the High Court, by its order dated

14.02.2022, has erred in law. It was the counsels contention that the

instant revisionary application can be maintained, irrespective of the

dismissal of the Writ petition before the Supreme Court, as the two

avenues are distinct in their objectives, albeit the similar result it would

occasion. This Court agrees with the counsel on the submission that the

revisionary jurisdiction under Article 138 of the Constitution of the Court

of Appeal is distinct from that of the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

under Article 140 of the Constitution read with Section 24(1) of the

Commission Act. Hence, it is accepted that a dismissal of a writ application

CPA 33-22 Page 4 of 8 27/09/2022 IJ-38-22

filed pursuant to Section 24(1) of the Commission Act read with Article

140 of the Constitution (especially when such dismissal was based on a

preliminary technicality) will not bar any litigant from pursuing the avenue

of revision under Article 138 of the Constitution where there is purported

illegality or irregularity in an order or judgment of a lower court.

Impugned order

The impugned order distinguished the procedural facts of instituting the

instant case with that of the Anoma Polwatte Case (supra) and goes on

to state the following:

12

12

(:

CPA/02/2021

)

12

.

.

. (Emphasis added)

(Vide pages 82, 83 of the Appeal Brief)

While this Court will clarify the highlighted part of the above extract in the

next section, it suffices to say that there is no prima facie illegality or

irrationality in the reasoning of the learned High Court Judge. The legality

or otherwise of an indictment filed pursuant to Section 12 of the

Commission act cannot be determined by the High Court. Such a

CPA 33-22 Page 5 of 8 27/09/2022 IJ-38-22

determination can only be done by invoking the writ jurisdiction of the

Supreme Court as per Section 24(1) of the Commission Act read with

Article 140 of the Constitution. (See Director General, Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption v Weerasekera

Arachchilahe Lalith Kumara LTA/06/16 CA Minute dated 23.02.2022).

Hence, the learned High Court Judges determination that

12

is faultless.

Similarly, the impugned order characterizing an indictment filed under

Section 12 of the Commission Act as akin to an indictment filed by the

Attorney General in relation to the manner in which a High Court should

treat such indictment cannot be construed as a misdirection. This

characterization was similarly asserted in Palitha Piyasiri Fernando v

Director General CIABOC CA(PHC)APN 37/20 CA Minute dated

31.07.2020 which held: Where proceedings are instituted in a High Court

in pursuance of a direction made by the Commission under section 11 by an

indictment signed by the Director-General, such High Court shall receive

such indictment and shall have jurisdiction to try the offence described in

such indictment in all respects as if such indictment were an indictment

presented by the Attorney General such court ". As such, it is the view of

this Court that there is no prima facie exceptionality in the impugned order

that warrants the issuance of notice to the respondents. Hence, it is the

well-considered opinion of this Court, that the order of the Learned High

Court Judge delivered on 14.02.2022 is good in law

However, this Court would be remiss of its duty if it did not clarify the

following statement made in the impugned order where the learned High

Court Judge has interpreted a judgment of this Court, namely Balasuriya

Arachchige Ranjan Somasinghe v Director General, Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption CPA 2/21 Ca Minute

dated 11.01.2022 (hereinafter Ranjan Somasinghe case).

CPA 33-22 Page 6 of 8 27/09/2022 IJ-38-22

Ranjan Somasinghe Case

Ranjan Somasinghe Case (supra) pivoted on the issue of whether the

impugned order of the High Court carried any prima facie illegality or

irregularity to the extent of exceptionality which warrants the issuance of

notice to the respondents named in the revisionary application (similar to

the instant case before us). Hence, this Court focused on the impugned

judgment in Ranjan Somasinghe whereby it was held that the following

extracts of the order of the High Court of Colombo dated 10.06.2020

delivered in Case No. HC 20/17 was neither contrary to law nor irregular

to the point of exceptionality:

. 12 (Commission Act)

.

78(1) .

12

. 12(1) 11

.

It must be unequivocally stated that this Court did not make any

pronouncement on the legal principles enunciated by the Anoma Polwatte

case (supra) vis--vis the Ranjan Somasinghe case. The Anoma Polwatte

case interpreted Section 11 of the Commission Act. And it examined

CPA 33-22 Page 7 of 8 27/09/2022 IJ-38-22

whether there is sufficient proof to establish that CIABOC has dispensed

the burden to ...direct the Director General to institute Criminal

proceedings against such person (person who has allegedly committed

offences under the Bribery Act or Act No 1 of 1975) in the appropriate

court.. This Court has consistently held that such an evaluation of the

CIABOCs dispensation of burden under Section 11 of the Commission

falls outside the ambit of the Court of Appeals jurisdiction and squarely

falls within the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 140 of

the Constitution read with Section 24(1) of the Commission Act. (See

Director General, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery

or Corruption v Weerasekera Arachchilahe Lalith Kumara (supra).

This Bench, in delivering the order of Ranjan Somasinghe case and other

similar applications referred to the Anoma Polwatte case (supra) only to

the extent of acknowledging that Anoma Polwatte case concerned

proceedings instituted before the Magistrate Court by way of a charge

sheet which is factually distinguishable from cases where the proceedings

were instituted in the High Court by way of an indictment. By drawing

such a distinction, this Court holds that any question of whether the

CIABOC has adequately dispensed its burden under Section 11 of the

Commission Act ought to be dealt via the Writ jurisdiction of the Supreme

Court and that neither the High Court nor the Court of Appeal can

entertain such objections.

Hence, the statement of the learned High Court Judge that

12

ought to be clarified to state that this Court, in delivering the

order in Ranjan Somasinghe Case did not discuss the applicability of the

principles enunciate therein, rather, that such an examination as was

carried out by the Supreme Court in Anoma Polwatte under its Writ

jurisdiction in evaluating the adequacy of CIABOCs commitment in

CPA 33-22 Page 8 of 8 27/09/2022 IJ-38-22

fulfilling the requirements of Section 11 of the Commission Act, cannot be

carried out by the Court of Appeal sitting in revision, and neither can by

the High Court. Hence, the Ranjan Somasinghe Case pivoted on whether

or not the Court of Appeal (and High Court) has the jurisdiction to

entertain objections based on Section 11 of the Commission Act wherein

the acts of an independent commission have been impugned.

Application dismissed without issuing notice.
