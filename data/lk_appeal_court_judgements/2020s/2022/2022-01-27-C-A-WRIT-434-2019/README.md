S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner preferred this Application against the 1st and 2nd Respondents seeking

reliefs inter alia, a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision containing in the Quit Notice

marked as P-8 issued by the Chairman of the LRC under section 3 of the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act, No. 7 of 1979 as amended. After filing this Application,

the 2nd Respondent, Mr. Sirimevan Dias who was the Chairman of the Land Reform

Commission (hereinafter referred to as the LRC), the 1st Respondent ceased to hold

office and his successor Mr. Nilantha Wijesinghe has been substituted as the 2A

Respondent.

The Petitioner's mother, Ekanayaka Basnayaka Mudiyanse Ralahamillage Mildred

Sudarma Delwita Madugalle owned agricultural land in excess of 50 Acres. By

operation of the Land Reform Law, No. 01 of 1972 (the Land Reform Law) all that

agricultural land owned by her deemed to vest in the LRC and she deemed to hold the

said land under a statutory lease from the LRC. She made a Statutory Declaration in

terms of section 18 of the Land Reform Law in respect of said land and by the powers

vested under section 19 of the Land Reform Law, the Chairman of the LRC at that time

made a Statutory Determination published in the Extraordinary Government Gazette

No. 206/3 dated 29th March 1976 (marked as P-3) specifying the several lands she was

allowed to retain. Out of the lands described in 1st to 7th schedules in P-3, the land

described in the 1st schedule is consisting with several lands, namely Walawwatta,

Pattiya Hena, Wewadante Hena, Bogaha Kumbura, Wewadante Kumbura,

Diyaniddewela and Wewliyadda which is in total extent of 45 Acres 2 Roods 32

Perches and depicted in the Final Village Plan No. 1240 Supplement No. 2 (marked as

P-4) as lots 231 and 232. The position of the Petitioner is that the land called Pattiya

Hena mentioned above in extent of 15 Acres falls within Lot 232 in P-4 which is in

extent of 33 Acres 2 Roods and 17 Perches and it was possessed by his mother until it

3

was gifted to the Petitioner by his mother on the deed of gift bearing No. 6573 attested

on 20.12.1989 (marked as P-5). The Petitioner claims that he is possessing that land as

a private land since it was gifted to him without any disturbance or hindrance. The 2nd

Respondent's predecessor in office, by letter dated 03.09.2018 (marked as P-6) and later

corrected the same by letter dated 22.03.2019 (marked as A1) informed to hand over

the vacant possession of a portion of Pattiya Hena in the extent of 4 Acres 0 Roods and

14 Perches to the LRC District Director of Kurunegala on or before 25.09.2018 alleging

that the Petitioner and his brother are in unlawful possession of that portion.

The position of the LRC is that the said portion of land had been vested on the LRC

and it is neither included in the Extraordinary Gazette marked as P-3 which the

Statutory Determination is in favour of the Petitioners mother nor shown in the Final

Village Plan marked as P-4. Responding to the said letters, the Petitioner by letter dated

11.10.2018 (marked as P-7) informed the predecessor of the 2nd Respondent that he is

in possession of the land gifted to him by his mother on the deed of gift marked as P-5

and thus, his possession is legal. Nevertheless, a Quit Notice dated 04.06.2019 (marked

as P-8) has been sent by the predecessor of the 2nd Respondent to the Petitioner in terms

of section 3 of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act, requiring him to vacate

and deliver the vacant possession of the land described in the schedule thereto on or

before 23.07.2019. By this Application, the Petitioner seeks to quash the Quit Notice

on the grounds that it has been issued without power, jurisdiction or authority and/or

ultra vires the powers and authority of the 1st and/or 2nd Respondent/s.

The Respondents position is that the mother of the Petitioner made a Statutory

Declaration (marked as 1R2) for Pattiya Hena for an extent of 22 Acres, that she was

allowed to retain 17 Acres 2 Roods and 36 Perches out of that 22 Acres by the Statutory

Determination published in the Extraordinary Government Gazette No. 206/03 dated

29th March 1976 marked as 1R3 (Petitioner has tendered the same document marked as

P-3), that the LRC is the absolute owner of an extent of 4 Acres 0 Roods and 14 Perches

of Pattiya Hena morefully described in the schedule to the Quit Notice marked as P-8,

that the land described in that schedule is situated adjacently to the land called Pattiya

Hena which the Petitioners mother was allowed to retained on the Statutory

Determination and that the Petitioner and his brother encroaching upon the land

4

described in the schedule to the Quit Notice which is owned by the LRC are in unlawful

possession of that land.

When the matter was taken up for hearing on 12.11.2021, the learned Counsel for both

parties made oral submissions and thereafter, they were allowed to file written

submissions within one month from that date. Nevertheless, neither party filed written

submissions up till 17.12.2021.

The learned Counsel for the Respondents argued that the crux of this Application deals

with the ownership of the land described in the Quit Notice and therefore, it is not

amenable to the writ jurisdiction. By this Writ Application, the Petitioner challenges

the opinion formed by the 2nd Respondents predecessor in office that the land described

in the schedule to the Quit Notice marked as P-8 is a State land and the Petitioner and

his brother are in unauthorized possession of that land. Since that opinion has been

formed by the 2nd Respondents predecessor in office on the administrative powers

vested in him in terms of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act, and the

administrative decisions are amenable to writ jurisdiction, this Court cannot accept the

above stated argument of the learned Counsel for the Respondent.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted to the Court that the Petitioner is

possessing the land called Pattiya Hena which his mother was allowed to retained on

P-3 dated 29.03.1976 and thereafter, gifted to him on P-5 by her in 1989, thus it is a

private land which the Petitioner and his predecessor in title enjoyed undisturbed,

uninterrupted possession since 1976 to the date of the Quit Notice on 04.06.2019 and

the LRC has no right, title or interest in the said land since 1976. The learned Counsel

for the Petitioner further submitted to Court that the LRC has failed to identify the

portion in the extent of 4 Acres 0 Roods and 14 Perches of Pattiya Hena on a plan which

the Respondents allege that the Petitioner is in unauthorized possession.

The land as described in the schedule to the Quit Notice marked as P-8, is a portion of

an extent of 4 Acres 0 Roods and 14 Perches in Pattiya Hena. The argument of the

learned Counsel for the Respondents is that the said portion of land belongs to the LRC

and it is situated adjacent to the land called Pattiya Hena which the Petitioners mother

was allowed to retained on the Statutory Determination and it is not included into that

5

Statutory Determination and the Petitioner had encroached upon that portion of land

and possessing the same.

It is the position of the learned Counsel for the Respondents that the land described in

the schedule to the Quit Notice marked as P-8 is depicted in the F.V.P. No. 1240

Supplement No. 2 marked as 1R1 and described in the Final Supplementary Tenement

List marked as 1R6. According to 1R6, Pattiya Hena is situated within lot 232. It has

been admitted by the Respondents that the Statutory Determination has been made on

1R3 (or P-3) for lots 231 and 232 in favour of the Petitioners mother. Under such

circumstance, it establishes the fact that the land described in the schedule to the Quit

Notice should be within lot No. 232.

Section 6 of the Land Surveys Ordinance, No. 4 of 1866 (as amended), provides thus;

If any plan or survey offered in evidence in any suit shall purport to be signed

by the Surveyor-General or officer acting on his behalf, such plan or survey shall be

received in evidence, and may be taken to be prima facie proof of the facts exhibited

therein; and it shall not be necessary to prove that it was in fact signed by the Surveyor-

General or officer acting on his behalf, nor that it was made by his authority, nor that

the same is accurate, until evidence to the contrary shall have first been given.

Hence, when applying the provisions in that section to the instant action, the Court

should consider the contents of the plan made by the Surveyor-General (marked as 1R1)

and the Final Supplementary Tenement List (marked as 1R6) produced from the

custody of the LRC as prima facie evidence and 1R1 and 1R6 is accurate since no

evidence contrary has been tendered. According to 1R6, lot 232 has been exclusively

claimed by the Petitioners mother before the Surveyor-General and the Statutory

Determination has been made for that lot in favour of her. The LRC neither had claimed

that lot nor a Statutory Determination had been made for the same in its favour.

Therefore, it is quite clear from the above stated evidence produced on behalf of the

Respondents and the admission made by the Respondents that the Statutory

Determination has been made on P-3 for lots 231 and 232 in favour of the Petitioners

mother that the LRC has no right/title to any portion of land in the land shown in the

F.V.P. 1240 Supplement No. 2 marked as 1R1/P-4 and described in the Tenement List

marked as 1R6.

The allegation of the LRC against the Petitioner is that he had encroached upon the land

of the LRC. The Petitioner denies that allegation and his position is that there is no

remaining portion of Pattiya Hena which belongs to the State other than the Pattiya

Hena for which the Statutory Determination P-3 was made in his mothers favour in

1976 and included into lot 232 in the Surveyor-Generals plan marked as P-4. The

Petitioner claim that his mother possessed said Pattiya Hena from the date of the

Statutory Determination in 1976 till the land was gifted to him in 1989 and after it was

gifted to him, he is possessing it up till the date of the Quit Notice on 04.06.2019 and

has relied on a long period of legal possession. Therefore, in addition to the paper title

to Pattiya Hena the Petitioner is claiming it on prescription. Under such circumstances,

it is clear that there is a serious question to be decided as to whether the land described

in the schedule to the Quit Notice is a State land. In the case of Senanayake vs.

Damunupola (1982 2 SLR 621) the Supreme Court has held that;

A purposive examination and interpretation of this Law (State Land (Recovery

of Possession) Act) shows that it was enacted to get back possession of State land which

had been given to a person on a contractual footing and where there was an obligation

to vacate and give up possession or occupation on the happening of some event as a

necessary consequence. This procedure could not be availed of where it is not clear

that the land in respect of which the right or title of the State was doubtful or in dispute

(at page 628). It was further held that;

The scope of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act was to provide a

speedy or summary mode of getting back possession or occupation of State land as

defined in the Act, where there was not subsisting at the relevant date, in the opinion of

the Competent Authority, a valid permit of authority. It was not meant to obtain

possession of land which the State had lost possession of by encroachment or ouster

for a considerable period of time by ejecting a person in such occupation (at page

628).

In view of that decision of the Supreme Court it is clear that the procedure laid down in

the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act could not be used to evict a person from

a land which the right or title of the State to that land is doubtful or in dispute and it

was not meant to obtain possession of land which the State had lost possession of by

7

encroachment or ouster for a considerable period of time by ejecting a person in such

occupation in circumstances such as have transpired in the instant Application.

Considering all the above stated facts and circumstances, I hold that there was no

material for the LRC to form an opinion that the land described in the schedule to the

Quit Notice is a State land and that the Petitioner has encroached upon that land and he

is in unlawful possession/occupation of the same. Therefore, I hold that the attempt of

the LRC to recover possession of the subject matter of the instant action is inconsistent

with the scope of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act and it has no right to

issue the Quit Notice marked as P-8 in terms of that Act. Under the said circumstances,

it is manifestly clear that P-8 has been issued by the predecessor of the 2nd Respondent

without jurisdiction and it is ultra vires. Therefore, I decide to issue a writ of Certiorari

quashing the decision containing in the Quit Notice marked as P-8. The Respondents

should pay Rs. 75 000/- as costs to the Petitioner.
