There is no legal restriction to enter a partition judgment in considering the variable stands taken up by the plaintiff-respondent about the corpus. Because of the strong defence taken up on behalf of the appellants stating that the property surveyed by the preliminary plan is not larger than the actual extent of those lands described in the schedule to the 3rd amended plaint as well as for the fact that the plaintiff-respondent has established the 4 boundaries at least of the Siyabalagahamula Watta which the plaintiff-respondent finally restricted to partition by this partition action.",
