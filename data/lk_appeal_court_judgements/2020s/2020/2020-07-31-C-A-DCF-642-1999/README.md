decide Ule following issues in this Appeal:

I. Whether the land described in the schedule to the Amended Plaint

called "Kudumeeriya" aEls "Goluwellukapuhena" now watta IS

depicted in the Survey Plan No. IB46 dated 11.09.198G (PI) made

by T.N. Cader, Licensed Surveyor as claimed by the Plaintills; or

and depicted in the SUlvey Plan No. I a4(j dated 11.09.198G made

by T.N. Cader, Licensed Surveyor is identical to the land called

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Kegalle 1995/L

"Delgahamulahena" which was partitioned in D.C. Keg-aile Case No.

18036 and is depicted in the Final Partition Plan No. 3589 dated

15.03.1968 made by Mr. J Aluvihare, Licensed SUIveyor;

Partition Decree in Case No. 18036/1'.

The Nature and Character of the Plaintiffs' Action

11I1 At the hearing of ulis appeal, the learned Counsel for tl1e Defendant

submitted that Ule action filed by tl1e Plaintiffs was a rei vliJr/icalio proper

and thus, the cause of action in rei vliJr/icatio action is, based on tl1e sole

ground of the violation of the Plaintiffs' rights of ownership. He

strenuously contended tl1at although the burden was on the Piaintills to

prove title, the Plaintiffs have failed to prove title to the land in dispute and

hence, the Plaintiffs' action must necess,Lrily be dismissed.

1121 The question whether tl1e action is to be treated as a rei vliJr/icatio or

declaration of tiue and ejectment or even possessory action depends on Ule

choice made by the Plaintiffs in their pleadings, including the prayer to

such pleadin/,'S, which enable the Court to understand the type and tl1e

character of Ule action presented by the Plaintills to tl1e Court.

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Keg.lle 1995/L

1131 The curious feature of this action is that the Plaintills are seeking a

declaration that they ,u-e the owner of the suhiect matter of the property,

ejectment 0[' the De['endant~ and damages. Paragraph 10 of the Amended

Plaint dated 2:~.11.1987 reads as follows:

1161 It is crystal clear that the present action of the Plaintills, as has been

presented, is purely based on the vindication of their title on the basis of

the Title Deed pleaded in para/"Taph 3 and the right of inheritance as

pleaded in paragraph 4 of the Amended Plaint. Thus, the Plaintitls have

set out the nature and character of dle action in their Pleadings without any

ambil,'Uity in such a manner to enable the court to understand the style and

character of their action, which is one of rei vindic;Hio proper.

Requisites of a rei vindicatio Action

1171 As this is a rei vindicatio action, dle Plaintiffs who seek a declaration of

tide must set out their title and prove their title to the land which is the

subject matter of the action. In Walligaratne v . ./UlVdJlil Appuhamy 65

N.L.R. 167, the Supreme Court stated that (i) in an action rei I'liidieatio,

dle Plaintitf must set out his tide on dle basis on which he claims a

declaration of tide to the land and must, in Court, prove dlat tide against

dle Defendant in the action; and (ii) it is imperative for the Plaintiff to

prove dlat tile Plaintiff is the oWller of dle land in question and dle

Defendant is in possession of the land in question.

If 81 A rei wildieatio action arises from the right of dominium and it is an

action IiI rem (founded on ownership) and therefore, the Plaintifl's

ownership of the thing is the very essence of rei Vlildicatio action where the

main issue that arises (or the adjudication is the PlaintifT's ownership of dle

property.

11 91 An owner can institute a rei vlildieatio action to recover his property

from whoever is in possession, irrespective of whether possession is bona

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Keg.lle 1995/L

,

fide or mala fide (Wille's Principles of South AfriGU1 Law, 9th Ed. P. 53~).

According to Vott, (i.1.22, 6.1.20.24, 6.1.24, G.I.2 and Wille's Principles

of South African Law, at page 539:

"to succeed wIlh dlt: re/ Vlild/cat/o, dIe owner musl prove on a haJance oj' p1VbabJi/lies, lint, hi~ or her ownenllliJ IiI the propel1y .... In dIe case oj' linmOl <lble~~ /t iI' sulficient as a lUle 10 show dlat IJde IiI the land i5 re/p:l1ered IiI hil' or her name, Secondly, dIe property must exil,t, he deady /dentIliabie and must not have been r!t:slJ{}yed or consumed .... 717Jidly, dIe defendant must he IiI posses,l'/on or detent/on oj'dle d7Jilg al lhe moment dIe act/on iI'

lilslJiuted '~

1201 The above-mentioned passage from Wille's Principles of South

African Laws has clearly stressed that to succeed with a vindicatory action,

an owner must prove on a balance of probabiliLies the following three

important elements:

(I) the property in respect of which the action has been instituted exists

and is clearly identilied (identilication of the property); and

(2) he is the owner of the property (ownership in the property in respect

of which the action has been instituted, in the absence of an

admissioll 011 the pleadings of his title); and

(3) the defendant is in possession or detention of the property at the

commencement of the action.

Identification of the Property in Dispute

1211 The tillldamental importance of the identilication of the property that

is subjected to ownership in a vindicatory action was clearly emphasized by

Marsoof .I. in u1e case of Ladled' and anolher v. 1l1ansoor and 'lnodler

20 II (B.L.R.) 20(i in the following manner:

"It I~' lJite law dlat the /denlJiy oj'dJe propelty Wldl respect to wllJ('h a v/nd/catOlyact/on iI' lilslJtuted /.1' as IiJJJriamentaJ to dIe success oj'dle acllon as dIe prooj' oj' dIe ownen/7JiJ (domlilJ'um) oj' dIe owner

1221 The important feature of the action presented by the Plaintiffs is that

the Plaintiffs are seeking a declaration of title to the land called

"Kudumeeriya" alias "Goluwellukapuhena" now watta, 111 extent of 2

Amunam of paddy situated in the \~llage of Asmadalle in the

Galbadakorale Egodapatlla Patttuwa of the Kelfdlle District. In tlle original

Plaint filed by the Plaintifls on 09.10.1979, the property had been

described only by metes and bounds. There was no reference to any survey

plan and the land called "Kudumeeriya" alias "Goluwellukapuhena" now

watta in extent of 1 Amunam was described in tlle following manner:

1231 The above-mentioned schedule to the Plaint filed by the PlaintifTs is

identical to the 3'" schedule to the Deed No. 1411 marked P3 dated

19.02.1953 which also has no reference to any survey plan. The Defendant

in his Answer however, denied tlle existence of the land called

"Kudumeeriya" alias "Goluwellukapuhena" now watta, as described in the

DCF - 0642 . 99 D.C. Kegalle 1995/L

schedule to the ori!,rinal Plaint and challenged the Plaintifls to survey and

depict the said land described in the schedule to the original Plaint by way

of a sUivey plan.

1241 Originally, the Plaintills did not wish to have the land described in the

schedule to the Plaint sUiveyed in the erroneous belief that they had got

title to the said land by virtue of' a decree of a District Court Case (journal

entry dated 14.07.1(80). The case referred to by the Plaintitls is a

possessory action (Case No. 15759) fibl by the I" Plaintiff and his tither

Punchirala against three Defendants by Plaint dated 31.01.1 %3 in respect

of the same land described in the schedule to the present case. In tile

possessory action too, no reference to any survey plan is mentioned in the

schedule to the said Plaint and the land is described by means of metes

and bounds of the said land (PG).

Survey Plan No. 1346 (PI)

12!i1 The su~ject malter of the action was surveyed and the land called

"Kudumeeriya" alias "Goluwellukapuhena" now watta is depcled in Plan

No. I :HG dated 11.09.198G (P I) made by Mr. T.N.eader, Licensed

Surveyor in extent of 4 acres 2 roods and I (j perches. (Annexure "A").

Final Partition Plan No. 3589 (VI)

1261 The Defendant strongly relied on the Final Partition Plan No. :~58<)

dated 15.m.I968 made by Mr. J Aluvihare in D.C. Kegalle Case No.

180:~(j/P (V I) to support his position that the land called

"Delgah;U11Ulahena" was partitioned in D. C. Kegalle No. 180:1(i/P and tile

said land is identical to the corpus claimed by the Plaintitls. The Defendant

has further produced a certified copy or the Final Decree entered by lhe

District Court or Kegalle in Case No. 18mG/ p marked V 4.

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Kegalle J995/L

1271 The said Final Partition Plan depicts the land called

"Delgahamulahena" in extent of 4 acres 2 roods and 8 perches (VI). It is

remarkable that the extent of the land depicted in Plan No. 1346 (PI) and

Final Plan No. 3589 by Mr. J Aluvihare (V I) is more or less the same

except a mere discrepancy of 10 perches (Annexure "B").

1281 A perusal of the certified copy of the said Plan No. 3589/P marked V I

and the Final Decree marked V 4 reveals that the land called

"Delg-ahamulahena" in extent of 4 acres 2 roods and 6 perches had been

partitioned in D.C. Keg-aile Case No. 18036/P by virtue of the Final

Partition Decree entered by the District Court of Kegalle on 27.06.1968.

Superimposed Plan No. 1346/A (V2)

1291 The superimposed Plan No. 1346/A dated 05.03.1991 made by Mr.

T.N.Cader (V2) depicts a land in extent of 4 acres 2 roods and 26 perches

(Annexure "C").

1301 Mr. T.N. Cader has stated in his Plan No. 1346 (PI) and

superimposed Plan No. 1346/A that at the time the survey, the Plaintitls

claimed the corpus as "Kudumeeriya" aiIils "Goluwellukapuhena" now

watta while the Defendant had identified the corpus as

"Delgahamulahena". It is remarkable that the extent of the land depicted in

all three Plans, No. 1346 (P I), No. 1346/ A and Final Plan No. 3589 is

more of less the same extent, except a mere discrepancy of about 10-18

perches.

1311 At the hearing, the learned Counsel for the Delendant submitted that

the superimposed Plan made by Mr. T.N. Cader No. 1346/A (V2), his

Report and evidence at the trial clearly establishes that the land claimed by

the Plaintitls and depicted in Plan No. 1:-346 (P I) is the identical land called

"Delg-ahamulallena" which was partitioned in D.C. Kegalle Case No.

the same land called "Delgahamulahena" by preparing a Survey Plan No.

Mr. TN,Cader himselr in his Report marked V3 and his evidence given in

the District Court or Kegalle. A perusal or the superimposed Plan No,

the said Plan was made by superimposing the Final Partition Plan No,

1341 Mr. T.N. Cader has testified in Court and stated that Mr. Aluvihare's

PI;m No. 3589 in D.C. Kegalle Case No. 18036/P is identical to the land

surveyed and depicted by him in Plan No. 1346 (PI). The oral evidence of

Mr. Cader and documentary evidence produced by the Defendant (Plan

No. 3589 (VI), Plan No. 1346/A (V2), the Final Partition Decree (V4) and

the Report (V5) plainly proved that the land called "Delgahamulahena"

which was partitioned in D.C. Kei,ralle Case No. 18036 is identical to the

corpus claimed by the Plaintiffs in Plan No. 1346.

His e\~dence at pages 70-71 of the brief is as follows:

1:151 It is of significance that the Plan No. f346 (PI) prepared by Mr.

T.N .Cader, Licensed Surveyor on a commission taken out by the

Plaintiffs has admitted that the land called Delgahamulahena" which is

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Kegalle I 995/L

r

..... . '

depicted in Mr. Aluvihare's Final p,utition Plan No. :1:)89 (V J) is

substantially the same land which is depicted in Survey Plan No. 1346

made by him for the purpose of this Case.

la61 The learned Counsel for the Plaintills, however, submitted that the

extent of the I,md depicted in the schedule to the Plaint in D.C Kegalle

\\utition Case No. :1:)89/1' called "Dclgah<llTIulahena" was 12 lahas which

is 120 perches whereas the land depicted in Plan No. 3589/P is 4 acres 2

roods and 8 perches and therefore, a larger land in extent of 4 acres and 2

roods and I(j had been surveyed in Plan No.1 :i4() (V2). He submitted that

the boundaries described in the schedule to the Plaint tiled in D.C. Keg-d.lle

Partition Case are totally different !i'om the land described in the schedule

to the present case and the boundaries depicted in Plan No. :1589 (V I).

1:171 The present Defendant who was the Plaintiff in D.C. Case No.

18036/P Case had set out pedigree Ille Plaint (P I 3(a) and paragraph 2 of

the said Plaint and the schedule to the said Plaint refer to a land called

"Delgahamulahena" in extent of 12 lahas of paddy sowing on the basis of

Ille oldest Title Deed No. 1:180 dated 14.04.1871. The Plaintiffs now seek

to challenge dIe Final Partition Decree in this case on the basis of a mere

discrepancy in the ancient sowing extent stated in the said Plaint <lIl(1 extent

depicted III Plan No. :1.'i89 according to the English system

of measurement.

1:181 As submitted by the learned Counsel foe the Defendant, the schedule

to the Plaint filed in the present case also reiers to a land in extent of I

Amunam of paddy sowing, which the learned Counsel for the Deiendant

submitted was equivalent to only two and half areas. He af/.,'Ued that if the

identity of the extent is decided on Ille basis of' sowing extent only, tJle

Pla.intills' action filils on Illat score alone as the land depicted in Pla.n No.

1:146 (P J) is in extent 4 acres 2 roods and 16 perches.

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Keg.lle 1995/L

1391 It is my opinion that the extent given in oldest title deeds in paddy

sowing under ancient land measuring methods may not be 100% accurate

as the extent of land required to sow paddy or kurakkan vary due to several

l~lctors. As observed by Weerasuriya.J. in Ratnayke v. Kumanhamy 2002

(I) Sri LR 65 quoting liOITI Ceylon Law Recorder, Vol. XXII, page XLVI:

"171e system of'I;U1d measure computed accorrhilg to dIe extent of' 1;U1d reqUlirxl to sow with paddy or kurakkcul vary due to dIe lilteracUon of'several li/etors. The cunount of'seed reqUli-ed could

1401 Even if it is assumed that there is a discrepancy in the extent of the

land described in Ule schedule to the Plaint and the land surveyed as

submitted by the learned Counsel for Ule Plaintitls, the identity of a land

sought to be partitioned is not detenTIined purely on the discrepancy in

extent of the land surveyed with the land described in the schedule to the

Plaint, but by the boundaries of the land surveyed in the preliminary plan.

It is settled law that where in a deed, Ule portion of land conveyed is

cleanly described and can be precisely ascertained, a mere inconsistency as

to the extent Ulereof will not affect the question of identity of the corpus of

the action (Vide- G,'abriel Pel-era v. Agnes Pel-era 43 CLW 82 and Yapa v.

DissiU1ayakeSedcuc/19W) 1 Sri L. R. 361).

141 1 To identil)1 Ule premises in dispute in an action involving ownership of

land, whether it is a partition action or rei vinclicatio action, the Coult must

eX,UTIme and take into consideration Ule boundaries described in Ule

schedule to Ule Plaint ,md depicted in the prelimimul' plan and Ulen,

examine whether Ule boundaries of the corpus of the action tally \o\~Ul the

1461 It is remarkable that the northern boundary of rlle I,Uld described in

the schedule to the Amended Plaint filed in dle present case and the

schedule to rlle Plaint tiled in D.C. Kegalle Case No. 18036 is the Ditch or

Epalawa Estate. The nOrdlerIl boundary of the land depicted in all dlree

Plans is clearly Epalawa Estate or AGala of Epalawa Estate and hence, dle

northern boundary of the land depicted in all rllree Plans is Ule same

nordlern boundary described in dle schedule to rlle Amended Plaint, the

Plaint filed by the Defendant in D.C. Keg-dlle Case No. 18036 and the

Partition Plan No. 3589 made by Mr. Aluvihare.

1471 The ea~tern boundary or rlle land described in the schedule to the

Amened Plaint filed in the present case and the Plaint filed in the Partition

Case is dle Ditch of Epalawa Estate. The eastern bOUJ1(!<uy or dle land

depicted in all dlree Plans mill-ked PI, V2 and V 1 is tlle same Ditch of

Epalawa Estate. Accordingly, dle eastern bouncl;uy of dle land described in

rlle schedule to dle Amened Plaint tiled in dle present case and rlle Plaint

filed in the Partition Case No. 18036 is the same eastern boundillY

depicted in Mr. Aluvihare's Pl,Ul No. 3589.

1481 The western boundalY of dle land described in rlle schedule to the

Amened Plaint filed in rlle present case is Geratemullehena and Dikhena

Periya and the Defendant has described the western boundary in the

schedule to Ule Plaint filed in the Partition Case as Galenda. The western

. .

I,.

I

boundary is depicted in the Preliminary Plan (P 14) and the Final Plan (V I)

in D.C. Kegalle Case No. 180:16 as Galenda/Ganweta and Moragahahena.

1491 The Defendant has identified the western boundary before Mr. Cader

as Moragahamulahena. A careful perusal of Mr. Cader's PI,Ul No. I aM)

(PI) and 1 :~46A (V2), Mr. Aluvihare's Preliminary Plan No. aa24 (PI4)

and Mr. Aluvihare's Final Plan No. :~aW) (V I) reveals that the western

boundary of the corpus is separated from Galenda. The Preliminary Phll1

marked P 14 produced by the Plaintills at the trial clearly conlirms that the

land called "Delgah,UllUlahena" is separated on the west Ii-om Galwetiya

(Annexure "D").

1501 It is manilest that irrespective of the fact that the western boundary is

described by the Plaintitb and the Dclendant in dillerent names, the

corpus of the action is clearly separated on the west from Galwetiya. In t.he

circumstances, it is my opinion that the western bOUJ1(!<uy of the corpus

described in the schedule to the Amended Plaint, the Plaint liled in the

Partition Case No. ISCl:l(j is substantially the same western boundary of the

land depicted in Plan No. I a46, (p I) I :146A (V2), PrcliminalY Plan No.

a:~24 (p 14) and the Final Plan No. :\:-lW) (V I).

1511 The southern boundary of the land described in the schedule to the

Amended Plaint is "Geratemullehena" and the southern boundary of the

land described in the schedule to the Plaint liled in the Partition Case

(P I aa) is "KurumeeriY'lhena". The Defendant has stated in evidence that

it was described in the Plaint according to the old Title Deeds of the

Defendant. The Plaint filed in the Partition Clse marked P I a (a) shows

that the oldest Title Deed set out in the Deleml,mt's Pedi/-"Tee was Deed

No. 4:180 dated 14.04.1871. The Preliminary Plan marked PI4 had been

prepared in 196(j and the southern boundary of "Delgahamulahena" is

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Kegalle 1995/L

described in the Preliminary Plan made in 1966 (P 14) and the Final Plan

made in 1968 (V i) as Galenda and Bulugahakadahena.

1521 It seems that Galenda is clearly shown on the southern boundary of

the corpus or the action depicted in Plan No. 1346 (Pi) and dle same

soudlern boundary is depicted in Plan No. 1346A (V2), Prelimimu'y Plan

(PI4) and the Final Plan No. 3589 (Vi). Mr. Cader has clearly identilied

the said Galenda and Galwetiya on his Plan No. 1346 (Pi) and shown the

curved shaped Galwetiya marked in red on dle southern boundary of the

corpus in Plan No. 1346A, which is consistent widl dle Galenda shown in

the Preliminary Plan No. 3324 (PI4) and dle Final Plan No. 3589 (Vi).

1531 In these circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that with the advent

of time dle name of the land which described dle soudlern boundary as

"Kurumeeriyallena" in dle old tide Deed made in 1871 would have been

non-exist with the passage of time iUld a new name would have been

inserted in place of dle old name on the southern boundary. However, dle

Galenda which remained unchanged as a vital identilication mark separates

the corpus of dle action from the land on the SOUdl as is shown by Mr.

Cader and Mr. Alivihare in their respective Plans.

1541 Accordingly, I am of dle view that irrespective of dle lact that the

southern boundary of the land described in dle schedule to the Plaint liled

in the Partition Case is "Kurumeeroyahena" according to the old Title

Deeds of tlle Defendant, the southern boundary of dle corpus is physically

Galenda as depicted in all four Plans.

1551 The learned Counsel for the Defendant submitted, however, that the

le;u'ned Additional DistrictJudge has totally disreg-arded the superimposed

Plan (V2) and Report (V3) and the evidence given by Mr. T.N. Cader and

rejected the superimposition solely on the basis of his evidence given in re-

examination dlat he cannot now remember who produced the Plan ror

1.'i71 It is settled law that the Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the

findings of lilCts, especially with regard to the credibility 01' witnesses unless

the lindings are highly unreasonable or perverse. In Fraad v. Brown &

CompcUly Ltd 20 NLH 282, the Privy Council stated thus:

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Kegalle J995/L

"It is rare that a deci5ion oFa judge so expreS5~ so expliCl~ upon a pOliJt of filct purely, is over mled by a COUlt of Appeal, because

Courts of Appeal recognize dIe pliceless advantage which ajudge of first Instance has IiI matteH oFdlat bi](i, as contrasted with any Judge of dIe COUlt of Appeal, who CiUl only leal71 fivm paper or fiVln nandt/ve of dlOse who were present It i5 velY raJe, IiI questiom of

1581 In Alwl~' v. Piyasena Femando 1993 (I) Sri LR 119 at 122, His

Lordship the Chief Justice G.P.S. de Silva observed that "it is well

established that the finding of primary facts by the trial judge who hears

and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeaL". In

Gunewardene v. Cabla! iUld Odlers 1980 (2) Sri U~ 220, Rodrigo J. held

tllat the Appellate Court will set aside inferences drawn by the trial judge

only if they amount to findings of tact based on:

(a) Inadmissible evidence; or

(b) After rejecting admissible and relevant evidence; or

(c) If the inferences are unsupported by evidence; or

(d) If the inferences or conclusions are not rationally possible or

perverse.

1591 It is true tllat in deciding tile issues of fact~, the advantage which a trial

judge has of seeing and hearing tile witnesses however, an Appellate Court

will set aside the finding of a b'ial judge when tile reasons !,>1ven by him for

accepting a party's story are conbdl), to what is plainly proved by

document~ produced in evidence by the opposite party (Selva!rum v.

7haoyaJpagar 54 N .L.R. 36 1 (P.C). Where the disbelief of a lvibless IS

based on the ground that tile ~vibless has contradicted himself and where

on examination, the conb-adictions do not amount to any tiling more tllan

an incapacity to explain or remember certain facts, an Appellate Court is

j

entitled to examine the evidence and arrive at an independent decision

(A/x/u/ SadJ;u' If, jJOgtl'lTrJ 54 N ,L.R. 102),

1601 Mr. Cader has, in re-examination, only expressed his incapacity to

explain the criteria adopted by him lill" the superimposition in the absence

of Mr. Aluvihare's Plan No. 3589jP at the time he testified in Court. I am

of the view that the learned Addditional District Judge should not have

rejected Mr. Cader's evidence on superimposition on that score alone. His

evidence that the Plan No. 1346 (PI) ,U1d Mr../. Aluvihare's Plan No. :~589

marked V I is identical is supported by his own observations in his Report

(V3) and thus, the reliahility of his evidence in reg;ml to the identity of the

two Plans remains unchanged in reex,unination as well. I Imler such

circumstances, the learned Addditional District Judge should not have

r~jected Mr. Cader's evidence on superimposition on that score alone.

r~ject:ion of the superimposed Plan No. 1346/ A does not amount to

anything more than his incapacity to explain or remember the criteria

adopted for ule superimposition in the absence of Mr. Aluvihare's Plan

No. 3568 (VI) with him at the time he testilied in Court 8 long years after

the preparation of the said Plan.

16 II I hold that the reasons I,riven by the learned Additional District Judge

for r~ject:ing Mr. Cader's superimposition and accepting only his Plan No.

1346 are contrary to what is plainly proved by the oral evidence of Mr.

Cader and the contents of the Plan No. 1346/ A (V2) and the Report (V:-l)

which specilically state ulat Mr. Aluvihare's Plan No. 3589 in D.C. Kegalle

Case No. 18():~6 is identical to the land depicted in Plan No. 1346 (PI).

1621 In these circumstances, I ;U11 inclined to agree with the learned

Counsel li)r ule Defendant that the corpus of the action claimed by the

Plaintills and depicted in Plan No. I :-l46 (P I) is the identical land called

"Delgahamulahena" which was partitioned by virtue of the Final Partition

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Kegalle I 995/L

Decree entered by the District COUIt in Case No. 18036 (p I aa) ,Ulel

depicted in Mr. Aluvihare's Final Plan No. 3589 (V2).

Title to the Corpus of the Action

l(i31 A rei vlildicatio action arises from the right of dominium and it is an

action ill rem (founded on ownership) md therefore, the Plaintitl's

ownership of the thing is the very essence of rei vindicatio actioll where the

main issue ulat arises for me adjudication is ule Plaintill's ownership of me

property. As noted, a Plaintiff who is seeking a declaratory relief in a rei

I-Indicalio action must prove and establish his title to the land in dispute

(WaIlig-dl<1tne I '. Juw;UJis Appuhruny (supra), Luwis Singho and olhen v.

POllnampel1Jma (1996 2 Sri LR 320). Thus, in a rei vli1fb'cauo action, the

PlaintifT must prove his or her title anel in establishing his or her title, the

Plaintifl' cannot rely on me weaknesses of me Defendant's title. In

Sl1narapaia I '. Jagoda (1986) I Sri LR 378, it was held that (i) in a

vindicatOlY suit, tlle Plaintiff must prove his title and having failed to prove

his own title, he cannot rely on tlle weaknesses of the Defenelant's title; ,Uld

(ii) whatever tlle stTenhrth of tile Delendant's case, if the Plaintifl" fails to

establish his title, me Plaintifl's case must necessarily fail.

1641 It is also importallt at tilis stage to consider the defences open to a

Defenelant in ,Ul action rei vliJ(licaUo. In Allis Appu v. Endn:\' Hamy alld

odlers (1894) 3 SCR 87, Withers./. referring to tlle aumority of Maynz Vol.

I page 786 said tllat a Defendant in a rei vlildicaao action can defend

himself:

(i) by denying Plaintifl's tille, which must be strictly proved;

(ii) by setting up his own title ,Uld establishing a title superior to

tllat of the Plaintifl";

(iii) prescription of tlle action;

(iv) tlle plea of resjudicala;

(v) right of tenure under the Plaintill's as for usulillct, pledge,

(vi) right to retain possession subject to indemnity !i'om the

(vii) (rhe plea of exception rei I'enditac et IDlditac, that is, by the

Plaintiff or his qualilied agent, to him-the Delendant-in

possession; and (viii) the JUS felvi (the title of third parties-one

having a superior title to the Plaintif"l).

1651 The Plaintirts sought to establish title to the corpus of the action by

Title Deed No. 1411 dated 19.02.195:-3 (P3) and inheritance lium

Esmadalle Koswatte Ralalage Mudiyanse. The Plaintitls have pleaded that

the orihrinal owner of the land called Kudumeeriya" alias

"Goluwellukapuhena" now watta was one Esmadalle Koswatte Ralalage

Mudiyanse who transferred undivided l/2 share to the 1st Plaintill' and

upon the demise of tlle said Mudiyanse, his remaining 1/2 share devolved

on tlle Plaintills who are the children of Mudiyanse.

1661 The Plaintill's pedigree, however, commences only from their lather

Esmadalle Koswatte Ralalage Mudiyanse but the Amended Plaint is silent

as to how and when the said Esmada.lle Koswatte Ralalage Mudiyanse

acquired title to the land claimed by them in their Amended Plaint. At the

trial, the Plaintiffs called the daughter of the 1st Plaintilf, Indrani Menike,

who gave evidence on behalf of all tlle Plaintifls. However, the 1st Plaintifr

who was alive was not called as a witness at the trial. The only Title Deed

produced by the Plaintills to establish title to the property was the Deed

No. 1411 marked pa, which states that the said Mudiyanse had transferred

1/2 share to tlle 1st Plaintilf. No other Title Deed was produced by tile

Plaintills to establish as to how Mudiyanse acquired title to the corpus of

tile action.

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Kegalle 1995/L

1671 The daughter of the 1st Plaintin; Inch-ani Menike has admitted in

evidence that she was not aware how Mudiyanse acquired title to the said

land. Her evidence at pages 83- 84 of tl1e brief is as follows:

1681 In view of tl1e aforesaid evidence of Indrani Menike, the learned

Additional District Judge has accepted the Defendant's position in her

judgment at page 181 of the brief that the Plaintitls have failed to adduce

any evidence to prove as to how Esmadalle Koswatte Ralalage Mudiyanse

became entitled to the property in dispute as follows:

1691 It is crystal clear that the Plaintills have f;liled to establish that the

Plaintifffs' purported predecessor in title, Esmadalle Koswatte Ralalage

Mudiyanse was the owner of the property in dispute and in the absence of

any proof that Mudiyanse became entitled to the property in dispute, the

said Mudiyanse could not have transferred \12 share of tl1e said property to

tl1e I st Plaintiff and tlms, upon his demise, the Plaintiffs could not have

inherited to the baJance 112 share of tl1e property ii-om M udiyanse.

Posseessory Action filed in the District Court of Kegalle

1701 A perusaJ of the judgment of tl1e learned Additional District Judge

clearly reveals that the Plaintiffs were declared owners of the property in

question on tl1e basis that tl1e Defendant filed the Partition Action bearing

1721 The said District Court Case bearing No. 15759 lilecl by Mudiyanse

and Punchirala (I st Plaintitl) on :-1 1.01.196:-1 was only a possessory action

(I 57.'i9jL). The Plaintills in that case prayed I()r the restoration of the

possession and ejectment of tile Defendants Ii'om the land called

"K I ." I' "(' I II k I " U( umenya a las ,0 awe au apu lena now watta. By the said

judgement dated OG.OH.I%5, the District Court restored the PlaintilTs'

possession and made order to eject the Delendants in Ulat case (pm. The

Appeal against the said judgment was dismissed by the Supreme Court on

25.09.19(j(). (P I I).

17al. In the possessory action, tile cause of actioll IS based on the

enjoyment of an earlier peaceful possession and subsequent ouster leaving

the question of title open for further investigation in anoUler suit and

hence, the possessicJSlY action cOllstitutes an action Ii! penonam.

1741 The PlaintillS' own documents marked PG-P 12 clearly indicate that

Case No. 15759 was only a land case (a possessoly action) which only

binds the parties to the action. Thus, it has no binding ellect on the

Detemi<mt who was not a party to Ule said action. The question of

ownership or prescriptive possession were never tried and decided in the

said action. The learned Additional District Judge was dearly in error in

making her lindings on the basis that there were two parallel partition

DCF - 0642 . 99 D.C. Kegalle 1995/L

action, one filed by the 1st Plaintiff and Mudiyanse (Case No. 15759/L)

and another by the Defendant (Case No. 18036/ P).

1751 The reasons given by the learned Additional District Judge that the

Plaintiffs are the owners of the property in question ,u"e cont:r<u)' to what is

plainly proved by documents produced and evidence adduced by the

parties and are clearly erroneous, irrational, unreasonable and

unacceptable and cannot stand. For those reasons, I hold that the Plaintiffs

have not proved title to tlle property in dispute and hence, the Plaintiffs'

action should fail for tlle failure to establish title to the land in question.

Prescritive Possession of the Plaintiffs

1761 At the trial however, the Plaintiffs have further raised issue .5 to

indicate their position that tlle Defendant forcibly entered the land 111

dispute on 16.02.1974 and dispossessed the Plaintiffs. It reads as follows:

further reveals tllat she has furUler decided that the Plaintiffs have acquired

prescriptive title by uninterrupted and undisturbed possession f()!" well over

10 years and tllUS, answered the issue 6 in favour of tlle Plaintills.

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Kegalle 1995/L

1791 The learned Additional District Judge has heavily relied on the

documents marked P4 to PG and the judgement of Ule Possessory action to

hold that the Plaintills and their predecessors had undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession in the land depicted in Plan No. J:-l4G (P I). The

documents marked P4-PG relate to a permit granted and Payments made

by the 1st Plaintilf lor Rubber Replanting Subsidy S('heme in 1 <)(j 1 and the

documents marked Pl :1 and P 15 relate to payments of acreage taxes by

Punchirala from 1%7-1%9, 1970.

1801 A perusal of the documents marked PI 0 (judgment) and P 12 (Fiscal

Report) reveals that alter the possessory action was decided in hlvour of

M udiyanse and Punchirala in [f)6.'>, the possession was handed over to

them by the Fiscal on 27.07.1 %7. The evidence of Indrani Menike was

that (i) Punchirala replanted bud Rubber in I %0 and ulerealter, when the

brother of the Defendant disturbed the possession of the land, a case was

liled in the District Court be;u-ing No. 1.'>7.'>9; (ii) the Fiscal handed over

possession thereof to Punchirala and then, Punchirala attempted to clear

the land, but the Defendant lorcibly entered into the l;md on 1.'>.02.1~)74

and destroyed Ule rubber plantation in 1986.

1811 She has, however, admitted in evidence that alulough Punchirala

replanted bud rubber in 19GO, he was not allowed to possess them by the

Ddendant and in the result, no party made use of the land ;tlter 19GO. Her

18 ~-l 1 No complaint was produced by Ule PlaintifTs to substantiate Ule

position [hat Ule Defendant forcibly entered into the land in question in

1974 and thereafter destroyed the rubber plantation in 198G. Apart Ii'om

the said documents 1'4 to Po, PI:-l and P 15 which relate to the period from

1967 -1971 , there is no other documents produced by Ule Plaintiffs to

establish Ulat after tlle possession was handed over to Punchirala and

Mudiyanse on 27.07.1967 in the possessory action, Uley continued to

possess Ule said land until such time Uley were dispossessed by the

Defendant on 16.02.1974.

DCF - 0642 - 99 D.C. Kegalle 1995/L

" , ..

1841 In this context, the learned Additional DistrictJudge has held that the

Plaintitls have not proved that Ule Defendant lorcibly entered into tlle l;U1d

in question on f G.02.f97 4 and dispossessed the Plaintiff and hence,

answered tlle issue no. 5 as "not proved'.

IS51 In the circumstances, the Plaintiffs have fitiled to adduce credible

evidence to prove that the Plaintills and their predecessors had

undisturbed, uninterrupted and adverse possession in t.he said land for

more Ulan 10 years and acquired prescriptive title to the same.

Accordingly, the findings of the learned Additional District Judge that tlle

Plaintitls and their prcdccessors possessed the I;Uld in question lor more

than 10 years and acquired prescriptive title to the said cannot stand.

Final and conclusive effect of the partition decree

IS61 The learned Counsel for Ule Plaintiff" further submitted that as the lis

pendens had not been registered in respect of a larger land and the

Plaintil'ls in the PI-e\~OUS partition case No. ISmG/p had not made the

present Plaintills parties to the said Partition Action, the judl,rment in the

said partition action is not conclusive as pCI' section 4S (a) of tlle Partition

Law.

1871 The District Court of Keg-aile Case No. 1808G is a Partition action and

lot 2 of the Final Plan No. 8589 (V I) was allotted to the present Defendant

who was the Plaintitf in the said case, while lot 1 of the the said Final Plan

was allotted to the I" to an' Defendants by virtue of the Final Decree of the

said Case marked V 4. Final Decree Decree entered by the District Court

on 27.0G.I%8 (V4).

IS81 The Defendant's position is that he was placcd in possession to lot 2

of Plan No. a!iS9 (V I) on 27.06.1968 by virtue of Ule Final Decree Decree

entered by the District Court on 27.0G.19GS (V4). The tinal decree entered

in a p;utition action is a decree ill rem and it binds Ule whole world as

1911 Although the learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs has merely stated in

the written submissions that no lis pendens was properly registered in Case

No. 18036/ P and therefore, the final decree is defective, no material was

placed before the District Court to substantiate this position by the

Plaintills.

1921 It has been clearly established by the Final Partition Decree entered in

the District Court of Ke/fdlle Case No. 18036/P that the present Defendant

was declared entitled to lot 2 and the I st to 3rd Defendants in tllat case

were declared entitled to lot I in Plan No. 3589 made by Mr..J. Aluvirare,

Licensed Surveyor.

1931 For those reasons, I hold tllat the Final Partition Decree entered by

the DistTict Court of Ke/fdlle in Case No. 18036/ P shall be final and

conclusive a/f.unst all persons notwitstnading any omission or delect of

procedure or in tile proof of title adduced before tile court or the lact that

all persons concerned are not parties to the partition action. The learned

Additional District Judge has clearly disreg;uded tile final and conclusive

effect of the Final Decree entered in tile Partition Case No. 180;.3(i/P which

binds the whole world.

1941 For tllose reasons, I am of the opinion that the findings of the learned

Additional District Judge are not rationally possible, unsupported by oral

and documentary evidence and are contrary to facts and law ;Uld therefore,

the judgment of the learned Additional District.J udge of Keg-dlle dated

13.07.1999 cannot stand.

DistrictJudge of Kegalle dated U3.()7.1999 and make order dismissing the

action libl by the Plaintill:' ill the District Court or Kegalle Case bearing

No. 1995/ L.
