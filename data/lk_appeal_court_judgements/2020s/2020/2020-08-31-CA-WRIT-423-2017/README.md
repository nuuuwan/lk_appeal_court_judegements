Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 1st Respondent, the Airport and Aviation Services (Sri

Lanka) Ltd, is a fully government-owned company with statutory

power to manage and develop civil airports in Sri Lanka

including the Bandaranaike International Airport. The 2nd

Respondent, its Chairman and also the Chairman of the Tender

Board relevant to this dispute, published the Notice marked P16

inviting bids for the operation of an Ayurvedic Medicinal

Products Shop in the departure/transit area of the

Bandaranaike International Airport. The Petitioner, Hettigoda

Industries (Private) Limited, and the 9th Respondent, Janet

Lanka (Private) Limited, submitted bids therefor.

The Technical Evaluation Committee appointed for consideration

of the bids made the following recommendation to the Tender

Board by 1R2:

TEC [Technical Evaluation Committee] observed that both

Bidders have fulfilled all eligibility requirements and

qualifications as per the Bidding Document. Considering the

clarifications and confirmations received from the

Department of Ayurveda and the best interest of the

Company, TEC recommends to award Space No. 47-D for

the Operation of an Ayurvedic Medicinal Products Shop in

Departure/Transit Area, BIA, Katunayake to the Highest

Bidder, M/S. Janet Lanka (Pvt) Limited for a period of five

years to the total Bid Value of Rs. 49,920,000.00 + VAT

and a Premium of Rs. 3,000,000.00.

6

This means, both the Petitioner and the 9th Respondent were

deemed equally qualified to be awarded the tender, but the 9th

Respondent was selected because its bid price was higher than

that of the Petitioner.

P16A sets out conditions/instructions to bidders.

The Petitioner says the 9th Respondent is disqualified from being

awarded the tender on several grounds. However, there is no

necessity to go into detail on each one of those grounds, as the

Petitioner at the argument confined its challenge of the

impugned decision to clause 7(iii) of P16A, which says bidders

Who are existing operators having more than one shop in the

Departure/Transit Area are disqualified from being awarded the

tender.

The Petitioner says the 9th Respondent is disqualified under this

clause, but the Technical Evaluation Committee failed to

consider the same in recommending to the Tender Board that

the tender be awarded to the 9th Respondent.

On this basis, the Petitioner seeks to quash by certiorari the

recommendation/agreement made/signed between the 1st

Respondent and the 9th Respondent awarding the tender to the

latter, and to compel the Respondents by mandamus to award

the tender to the Petitioner.

The Petitioner in paragraphs 57 and 58, under the subheading

THE 9TH RESPONDENT IS DISQUALIFIED FROM TENDERING IN

TERMS OF CLAUSE 7(iii) OF THE INSTRUCTIONS TO BIDDERS,

states:

7

57. Furthermore, the Petitioner states there are at least 3

other shops with the name of Spa Ceylon Luxury

Ayurveda already in operation at the Transit Area of the

Bandaranaike International Airport and therefore, there has

been a clear violation of the disqualification set out in

clause 7(iii) of the eligibility and qualification criteria

provided for in the instructions to bidders.

58. The Petitioner further states that the 9th Respondent is

attempting to circumvent the said prohibition, by submitting

bids under the name of different entities. However, the

Petitioner states that ultimately, it is the same product

range offered, although the bidder appears to be a different

entity on the face of the record. Therefore, in any event, the

mischief that was expected to be prevented, by and through

clause 7(iii) has been patently violated.

The 1st-7th Respondents in their statement of objections do not

specifically deny or explain the above allegation/assertion, apart

from the standard general denial in the first paragraph of all

averments in the petition except those specifically admitted.

The 9th Respondent, in my view, ought to have answered

paragraphs 57 and 58 of the petition by way of a separate

averment in the statement of objections. Instead, the 9th

Respondent, in paragraph 23 of the statement of objections,

answers the said allegation/assertion together with several other

paragraphs of the petition.

In paragraph 22 of the statement of objections, the 9th

Respondent inter alia states:

8

22. The 9th Respondentonly admits that the shareholders

of the 9th Respondent and the Spa Ceylon Ayurveda (Pvt)

Ltd are the same and also admits the contents of the

www.spaceylon.com website.

(i) The 9th Respondent acts as the manufacturing arm within

the associate group of companies;

(ii) Products offered by any associate company within the

Group are manufactured by the 9th Respondent who

operates the manufacturing facility/plant.

(iii) Though the products may be under different brand-

names as elaborated hereinbelow and may be marketed

by other associate companies within the Group such as Spa

Ceylon Ayurveda (Private) Limited such products are

manufactured by the 9th Respondent.

(iv) The 9th Respondent not only manufactures but also

markets and operates several outlets, shops and boutiques

and engages in the sale of products manufactured by the

9th Respondent under different brand-names.

In paragraph 23 of the statement of objections, the 9th

Respondent inter alia states:

23(i) Spa Ceylon Ayurveda (Pvt) Ltd is a separate entity

from the 9th Respondent which is engaged in the marketing,

promoting and branding of selected items manufactured by

the 9th Respondent.

9

(ii) The 9th Respondent apart from manufacturing cosmetics,

soaps, spa products also manufactures Ayurvedic Products

such as oils, balms, herbal compress, inhalers, ointments,

serums, essential oils, health supplements, Ayurveda

herbs, herbal infusions, natural coconut products.

(vi) The 9th Respondent was only operating one outlet at the

Bandaranaike International Airport at the time of the bid,

for a different product range, namely, Local Aroma Spa

Products.

In paragraphs 31 and 32 of the statement of objections, the 9th

Respondent states:

31. The 9th Respondent states that products manufactured

by the 9th Respondent are widely marketed locally and

internationally and further states that the range of products

under the different brand names stated above are

marketed as follows

(i) Products under the SPA CEYLON are sold in over forty

outlets (internationally and locally) including

international airports including Sri Lanka, Chennai,

Mumbai, Kuala Lumpur and Male, in up-market stores in

Sri Lanka in boutiques operated by the 9th Respondent

and/or boutiques and Spas operated by associate

companies;

(ii) Products under the Luv Essence brand are sold in

boutiques operated by the 9th Respondent Company or

sold by other companies or in other retail stores.

10

(iii) Products under the Janet brand is sold in

approximately 3,000 leading supermarkets, pharmacies

and retail stores in Sri Lanka through a network of

distributors with the assistance of associate companies

of the 9th Respondent.

32. The 9th Respondent further states that around twelve

Spa Ceylon boutiques market products manufactured by

the 9th Respondent which are mostly products certified and

registered under the Department of Ayurveda.

In my view, there is no straightforward and clear denial by the

9th Respondent of the Petitioners allegation/assertion that

there are at least 3 other shops with the name of Spa Ceylon

Luxury Ayurveda already in operation at the Transit Area of the

Bandaranaike International Airport. Instead, the 9th Respondent

accepts that the shareholders of the 9th Respondent and Spa

Ceylon Ayurveda (Pvt) Ltd are the same and the said Spa Ceylon

Ayurveda (Pvt) Ltd is one of the associate companies within the

Group, selling Ayurvedic medicinal products manufactured by

the 9th Respondent under different brand-names.

The 9th Respondent, in my view, prevaricates and responds to

the Petitioners above allegation in the most evasive if not illusive

manner when it says The 9th Respondent was only operating one

outlet at the Bandaranaike International Airport at the time of the

bid, for a different product range, namely, Local Aroma Spa

Products.

This means, the 9th Respondent directly accepts it was operating

one shop in the departure/transit area at the time of the bid,

11

but indirectly says the other three shops in the name of Spa

Ceylon Luxury Ayurveda came into existence after the time of

the bid. Photographs of these three shops under the name Spa

Ceylon Luxury Ayurveda have been compendiously marked

CA1A and tendered with the counter affidavit of the Petitioner.

Prior to the argument, the 9th Respondent did not tender any

documents (with the permission of the Court) to say (a) the

CA1A photographs are forgeries, and/or (b) the said three shops

came into operation after the time of the bid.

I cannot understand the exact meaning and significance of the

phrase at the time of the bid, as put forward by the 9th

Respondent. It appears, what is meant by the 9th Respondent

thereby is, at the time of submitting the bid, the 9th Respondent

did not have more than one shop in the departure/transit area.

But, according to clause 7(iii) of P16A, existing operators of more

than one shop in the departure/transit area were not to be

considered by the 1st Respondent for award of the tender. This

means, at the time of the bid being accepted, the bidder should

not have had more than one shop in operation. The 9th

Respondent does not say the said three shops were not in

operation at the time of acceptance of the bid, i.e. when the

Decision of the Tender Board was made on 02.10.2017, as seen

from 1R2.

It is submitted on behalf of the 1st, 2nd, 4th-7th Respondents that

the burden is on the Petitioner to prove the 9th Respondent had

more than one shop in operation at the relevant time. As I have

already explained, the same has been proved by the Petitioner to

the satisfaction of this Court. This is a writ Court, not a

12

criminal Court for charges to be proved beyond reasonable

doubt.

As seen from 1R2, the main concern of the Technical Evaluation

Committee was to award the tender to the highest bidder. The

1st, 2nd, 4th-7th Respondents say in the written submissions The

grand total of the bid made by the 9th Respondent was

Rs.52,920,000, which is Rs.18,240,000 higher than the grand

total of the bid made by the Petitioner. If the grand total of the

bid is the decisive factor, disqualifications need not be set out.

Clauses such as 7(iii) of P16A are incorporated into tender

documents to minimise monopoly and maximise consumer

protection. After all, the 1st Respondent is not a private

enterprise, but a fully government-owned company.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, it is clear the 9th

Respondent is disqualified from being awarded the tender in

view of clause 7(iii) of P16A, which the Technical Evaluation

Committee failed to consider. Hence, I take the view it is wrong

on the part of the 1st Respondent to have awarded the tender to

the 9th Respondent instead of to the Petitioner.

When the Petitioner filed this application on 11.12.2017, the

Petitioner was not aware that the Agreement 1R1 had been

signed on or around 10.11.2017, awarding the tender to the 9th

Respondent.

I quash the Agreement marked 1R1, tendered with the motion

dated 24.06.2020, by certiorari and compel the 1st and the 2nd

Respondents by mandamus to award the tender to the Petitioner

for five years from the date of signing the Agreement.

13

I grant the Petitioner the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (B)-

(L) and (W) of the prayer to the petition.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs.
