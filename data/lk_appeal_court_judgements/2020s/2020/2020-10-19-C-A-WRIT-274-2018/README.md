Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 4th Respondent was appointed as a Distraining Officer/Rate

Collector of the 1st Petitioner Colombo Municipal Council by P2

in 1978. P2 inter alia states the 4th Respondent shall enter into

an Agreement with the Colombo Municipal Council for a period

of one year prior to commencing work. The Colombo Municipal

Council retained absolute power to terminate the Agreement

even within that period, if the work of the 4th Respondent was

found to be unsatisfactory. The work assigned to the 4th

Respondent was to collect municipal rates due to the Colombo

Municipal Council from members of the general public who had

defaulted on payments. P2 says the 4th Respondent would be

paid only a commission on his collection; no other salary or

allowances would be paid. When the annual Agreements

between the 1st Petitioner and 4th Respondent had come to an

end by effluxion of time, new Agreements were entered into

between the parties. As seen from the documents marked P6(a)-

(d), the 4th Respondent was not allowed to carry out his work in

1996 despite an Agreement being in force, apparently due to

concerns pertaining to misappropriation of collected rates. This

shows the fragile nature of the job of the 4th Respondent. The

last Agreement between the parties had been in 2016, after

which no new Agreement was signed. By P8, the Colombo

Municipal Council informed the 4th Respondent of its decision

not to extend his contract period beyond 31.12.2016. It is

thereafter that the 4th Respondent for the first time complained

to the 1st Respondent Commissioner General of Labour by P9

about Employees Provident Fund benefits not being paid to him

by the Colombo Municipal Council for his employment as a Rate

Collector. In P9, the 4th Respondent admits that during his

4

entire period of service as a Rate Collector he had not been given

any promotions, salary increments etc. In fact, this is because

the 4th Respondent was only entitled to a commission on what

he collected as arrears of municipal rates. If he did not collect

anything, he was not entitled to anything. Payment by way of

commission is simple and straightforward.

There had been an inquiry by the 1st Respondent Commissioner

General of Labour on the complaint P9. The Colombo Municipal

Council says no decision was given after the inquiry, but it

received Final Notice by P22, which is a warning prior to the

institution of legal action, whereby the Colombo Municipal

Council was required to pay a sum of Rs.3,249,535.74 to the 4th

Respondent as payment in terms of the Employees Provident

Fund Act. Although I am not inclined to allow the application on

this ground, I accept the complaint of the Colombo Municipal

Council in this regard. Let me explain.

After receipt of the Final Notice P22, the Legal Officer of the

Colombo Municipal Council sent P25 to the 1st Respondent,

requiring the latter to issue a copy of the journal entries of the

inquiry and the written submissions of the 4th Respondent. The

1st Respondent then sent P26 explaining the basis for P22. In

other words, P22 dated 06.01.2018 is the decision and P26

dated 06.06.2018 is the reasons for the said decision.

However, when this matter was raised by the Colombo Municipal

Council in the petition filed in this Court, the 1st Respondent

tendered 1R6 dated 20.09.2017, stating that the decision with

reasons had been pronounced on 20.09.2017. If this position is

correct, i.e. that the decision with reasons was delivered on

20.09.2017, the 1st Respondent, in my view, could have easily

5

sent a copy of the detailed order 1R6 to the Legal Officer of the

Colombo Municipal Council in reply to P25. There was

absolutely no necessity to give reasons separately by P26. 1R6

dated 20.09.2017 and P26 dated 06.06.2018 are not the same,

although the subject matter is the same. The 1st Respondent

could not have first taken the decision and thereafter looked for

reasons to justify it. That is not justice. It shall happen vice

versa.

Be that as it may, let me now get back to the main issue.

The Petitioners have filed this application predominantly seeking

to quash the P22 Final Notice and P26 reasons for the decision

of the 1st Respondent that the 4th Respondent is eligible for

benefits in terms of the Employees Provident Fund Act.

Who is entitled to benefits under the Employees Provident Fund

Act No.15 of 1958, as amended? To my mind, this is a difficult

question to answer. Learned State Counsel for the 1st

Respondent rightly concedes The benefit of the Employees

Provident Fund Act accrues to an individual if he was in an

employer-employee relationship during the material time and was

so employed in a covered employment. Learned Counsel for the

4th Respondent also admits this when he says The 4th

Respondent is an employee in terms of the law and the

employment is covered employment. If I may put it in my own

words, an employee (as opposed to an independent contractor)

engaged in a covered employment is entitled to benefits in terms

of the Employees Provident Fund Act. This means, two

conditions shall be satisfied: (a) the person shall be an employee

and not an independent contractor; and (b) the employment

shall be a covered employment. A word of caution: this does not

6

necessarily mean every employee in a covered employment is

entitled to Employees Provident Fund benefits.

The Employees Provident Fund Act has been amended since its

enactment and, from time to time, the subject Minister has

made Regulations in terms of section 46 of the Act. For me, this

has sometimes led to (at least apparently) irreconcilable,

overlapping or contradictory positions within the statutory

framework, resulting in the determination of who is entitled to

Employees Provident Fund benefits being more strenuous.

Let me now draw my attention to the statutory provisions in this

regard. Section 8 of the Employees Provident Fund Act reads as

follows:

(1) Any employment, including any employment in the

service of a corporation whose capital or a part of whose

capital is provided by the Government, may by regulation

be declared to be a covered employment.

(2) Regulations may be made

(a) to treat as a covered employment any employment

outside Sri Lanka which is for the purposes of a trade

or business carried on in Sri Lanka and which would

be a covered employment if it were in Sri Lanka; and

(b) to treat as not being a covered employment or to

disregard

(i) employment under a person who employs

less than a prescribed minimum number of

employees;

7

(ii) employment of a person in the service or for

the purposes of the trade or business, or as a

partner, of that persons spouse.

(3) Subject to the other provisions of this Act, every person

over a prescribed age who is employed by any other person

in any covered employment shall be an employee to whom

this Act applies. For the purposes of this subsection

different ages may be prescribed for different covered

employments.

(4) Any regulation declaring any employment to be a

covered employment may provide that such persons only as

earn less than a prescribed amount in that employment or

as are of a prescribed class or description, and not other

persons in that employment, shall be employees to whom

this Act applies.

The above is amplified by Regulations 2-5 of the Employees

Provident Fund Regulations of 1958 read with the First

Schedule thereto. These Regulations made by the Minister of

Labour in terms of section 46 of the Employees Provident Fund

Act and published in Gazette No.11,573 dated 31.10.1958, have

been amended from time to time. Let me quote the relevant

Regulations for convenience:

COVERED EMPLOYMENTS

2. (1) Save as hereinafter provided in regulations 3 and 4 -

(a) every employment specified in the First Schedule

to these regulations, and

8

(b) every employment outside Ceylon which is in

connection with or for the purposes of, the trade or

business of any employer in any employment

referred to in that Schedule and which would be a

covered employment if it were in Ceylon,

shall be a covered employment.

(2) Every person employed in any covered employment

other than -

(a) a person holding the office of director in respect of

his employment as such director,

(b) a person who is a partner in any partnership in

respect of his partnership,

(bb) a person who is employed under any local

authority and for whom superannuation benefits or

benefits on termination of employment are provided

under any Provident Fund or Pension Scheme

established under any other written law,

(c) a person who is employed in a managerial,

executive or technical employment and for whom

superannuation benefits or benefits on termination of

employment are provided under any provident fund

or pension scheme or any other fund or scheme,

established or administered outside Ceylon, and

(d) a person who is employed outside Ceylon, for the

purpose of such employment but who is not ordinarily

resident in Ceylon,

9

shall be an employee to whom the Act applies.

3. Any employment on any work which is usually

performed by the day or by the job or by the journey shall

not be a covered employment.

4. The employment by any employer of that employers

spouse in the service or for the purposes of the trade or

business of that employer shall not be a covered

employment.

5. The age prescribed for the purposes of sub-section (3) of

section 8 of the Act shall be fourteen years in respect of

every covered employment.

FIRST SCHEDULE

Every employment other than employment -

(a) under the Government of Ceylon; or

(b) under the Local Government Service Commission

established under the Local Government Service

Ordinance, No. 43 of 1945; or

(c) under of any local authority, being a local

authority in respect of the employees of which a

pension scheme or provident fund has been

established under any other written law.

In this Schedule the expression local authority means any

Municipal Council, Urban Council, Town Council or Village

Council.

10

It is relevant to note that by Regulation 3, independent

contractors are excluded from the application of the Employees

Provident Fund Act. If I may repeat for emphasis: Any

employment on any work which is usually performed by the day

or by the job or by the journey shall not be a covered

employment. The Court shall, in my view, give purposive

interpretation to this Regulation, as literal interpretation might

lead to absurdity.

Let me pause for a while to say this. There is a misconception

that the broader meaning given to the word employee in

section 47 of the Employees Provident Fund Act takes away the

rigors of Regulation 3 in the applicability of the Act. But this is

not so. Section 47 of the Employees Provident Fund Act (which

is the interpretation section) reads as follows:

employee means any person who has entered into or

works under a contract with an employer in any capacity,

whether the contract is expressed or implied, or oral or in

writing, and whether it is a contract of service or of

apprenticeship or a contract personally to execute any work

of labour, and includes any person ordinarily employed

under any such contract, whether such person is or is not in

employment at any particular time.

This definition does not per se expand the scope of entitlement

to Employees Provident Fund benefits. This definition speaks of

contract of service but does not speak of covered

employment. Section 8(3) of the Employees Provident Fund Act

is specific when it declares: Subject to the other provisions of the

Act, every person over a prescribed age who is employed by any

other person in any covered employment shall be an employee to

11

whom this Act applies. Covered employment is defined by way

of the Regulations referred to earlier. Hence, any person who

has entered into or works under a contract with an employer in

any capacity including a contract personally to execute any

work of labour can be an employee, but may still not be eligible

for the benefits of the Employees Provident Fund.

To have an overall understanding of this complex area of law, let

me refer to two Regulations made in terms of the Act, which deal

with commission-based payments and commission-based

employments.

Section 47 of the Act defines the word earnings as follows:

(a) wages, salary or fees;

(b) cost of living allowance, special living allowance and

other similar allowances;

(c) payment in respect of holidays;

(d) the cash value of any cooked or uncooked food provided

by the employer to employees in prescribed employments

and any such commodity used in the preparation or

composition of any food as is so provided, such value being

assessed by the employer subject to an appeal to the

Commissioner whose decision on such appeal shall be final;

(e) meal allowance; and

(f) such other forms of remuneration as may be prescribed.

According to the Labour Code of Sri Lanka a compilation of

labour laws published in 2010 by the Ministry of Labour

12

Relations and Productivity Promotion Regulation 60(3) of the

Employees Provident Fund Regulations of 1958 has been

amended by Gazette No.14,711 dated 02.09.1966. After the

amendment, Regulation 60(3) reads as follows:

For the purposes of section 47 of the Act, the earnings of

any employee shall include remuneration paid to him at

piece rates and remuneration, if any, paid to him by way of

commission for any services rendered to the employer.

It is important to realise that the expansion of the definition

given to the word earnings does not entitle an employee paid

by way of commission to Employees Provident Fund benefits.

The definition of the word earnings is there to decide the

quantum of contributions to be made to the Employees

Provident Fund, both by the employer and employee, and not to

decide who is an employee or what is a covered employment.

I must also make reference to the Regulations published in

Gazette No.14,936 dated 11.12.1970. The said Regulations have

been made under section 10(3) of the Act.

Section 10 of the Act enacts:

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section

and of section 27, an employee to whom this Act applies

shall, in respect of each month during which he works in a

covered employment, be liable to pay to the Fund a

contribution of an amount equal to eight per centum of his

total earnings from that employment during that month.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section

and of section 27, the employer of every employee to whom

13

this Act applies and who is liable to pay contributions to the

Fund shall, in respect of each month during which such

employee is in a covered employment under such employer,

be liable to pay to the Fund on or before the last day of the

succeeding month, a contribution of an amount equal to

twelve per centum of such employees total earnings from

that employment during that month.

(3) The liability of an employee in a covered employment

and his employer to pay contributions under this section

shall commence on the day immediately after the date fixed

in relation to such employment by the Minister by Order

published in the Gazette. Different dates may be fixed

under this subsection for different classes of employees in

the same covered employment.

Section 10(3) provides for the Minister to fix the dates for

commencement of Employees Provident Fund contributions by

the employer and employee in respect of certain covered

employments. By Gazette No.14,936, the Minister has fixed

31.12.1970 as the date of commencement of payment in respect

of the covered employments stated therein.

I will advert to one item in the said Gazette, i.e. item 23(e), which

refers to commission agents. It reads as follows:

Employment in the service of any undertaking, not being an

undertaking carried on by a person as an undertaking in

which only members of his family are employed in which

less than three persons are employed and which is

established wholly or partly for the purpose of carrying on

the business of(e) a commission agent.

14

Although commission agent is referred to in this item as a

covered employment, closer scrutiny reveals that all

commission agents cannot be considered persons engaged in

covered employment. If I may repeat, according to this item, a

person who is in employment in the service of an undertaking

(job/business/piece of work) established wholly or partly for the

purpose of carrying on the business of a commission agent can

be considered a person engaged in covered employment. This

item gives prominence to the business of a commission agent,

not the role of a commission agent per se.

Be it noted that the Regulations mentioned above do not repeal

or replace the express provisions in Regulation 3, i.e. Any

employment on any work which is usually performed by the day

or by the job or by the journey shall not be a covered

employment, which, as I have already stated, excludes

independent contractors from claiming benefits under the

Employees Provident Fund Act.

Whether a person is an employee in the legal sense (contract of

service) or an independent contractor (contract for service) is a

vexed question without a straightforward answer. Only the

former is entitled to statutory benefits such as the Employees

Provident Fund, not the latter. Many theories and tests,

including the Control Test, Integration Test, Dominant

Impression Test, Economic Reality Test, Mutuality of Obligation

Test, and Multiple Factor Test, have been formulated to address

this question. More will be added to this list in time to come. But

none of these tests are decisive. The answer to the question of

whether someone is an employee or independent contractor

invariably depends on the unique facts and circumstances of

15

each individual case. Hence, I will deal more with facts than

theories, since this is a Court of Law and not an Academy of

Law, as Chief Justice Abrahams stated as far back as in 1936,

in Vellupillai v. The Chairman, Urban District Council 39 NLR 464

at 465.

Rate Collectors collect dues on warrants issued by the Municipal

Commissioner and return collection receipts to the Municipal

Council on a weekly basis. The 4th Respondents payment was a

7% commission on the default rate collection, which was settled

on a quarterly basis by the Colombo Municipal Council. No

separate monthly salary or any other remuneration was paid.

Unlike other salaried employees of the Colombo Municipal

Council, the 4th Respondent was not entitled to overtime

payments, allowances, medical benefits, promotions, increments

etc. There was no necessity for him to mark attendance or

follow the regular protocols for taking leave or the like. This has

been admitted by the 1st Respondent in P26 containing the

reasons for the impugned decision.

I have already stated that the documents marked P6(a)-(d) point

to the fact that for a period of about one year in 1996 the 4th

Respondent had not been permitted to collect rates due to some

alleged wrongdoing regarding collection of rates. No inquiry

seems to have been held or disciplinary action taken against the

4th Respondent. If he were an employee, a different procedure

would have been adopted. If the work of an independent

contractor is unsatisfactory or questionable, he is not given

work; he cannot be dismissed or subjected to disciplinary action.

Entering into third party Agreements to collect default rates is,

in my view, recognised inter alia under section 40(1)(g) of the

16

Municipal Councils Ordinance, which says the Municipal

Council shall have the power to enter into any contract with any

person for any work to be done or services to be rendered.

Section 228 provides for such contracts to be reduced to writing,

as had been done in the instant case. Section 229 provides for

sufficient security to be taken for the due performance of the

contract. The requirement of a security deposit was informed to

the 4th Respondent in the letter P2 itself, even before the parties

entered into an Agreement.

In terms of section 252 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance,

warrants for recovery of rates and taxes can be issued to some

collector or the other officer of the Council, thereby distinguishing

between Rate Collectors and other officers of the Municipal

Council apparently discharging similar functions. The phrase

some collector itself speaks volumes of the nature of the job of

the 4th Respondent. According to section 253, arrears of rent as

opposed to rates can be collected by an authorised officer of the

Council assisted by his assistants, not by Rate Collectors.

According to the appointment letter P2, the 4th Respondent is

not assisted by employees of the Council in collecting default

rates. He does so on his own without any compulsion by the

Municipal Council.

I have already stated that the yearly Agreements entered into

between the 1st Petitioner and 4th Respondent had express

clauses to specify it was not a contract of service but a contract

for service, the Colombo Municipal Council was not obliged to

retain the services of the 4th Respondent during the relevant

periods stated in the Agreements, and the 4th Respondent was

17

not entitled to remuneration other than the stipulated

commission fee.

Although these clauses are not decisive, since the Municipal

Councils Ordinance itself provides for entering into such written

independent Agreements (for contracts for services as opposed to

contracts of services), I consider the said clauses to be binding

on the parties.

P6(c) goes to show that the father and elder brother of the 4th

Respondent had also been Rate Collectors. However, it does not

appear they made claims for benefits in terms of the Employees

Provident Fund.

In the reasons for the decision given in P26, the 1st Respondent

says the 4th Respondent acted as an agent of the Colombo

Municipal Council in collecting default rates and was therefore

an employee of the Colombo Municipal Council. Section 311 of

the Municipal Council Ordinance distinguishes between duly

appointed officers or servants of the Council and contractors or

agents to whom collection of rates is entrusted. Hence, although

a Rate Collector can act as an agent of the Colombo Municipal

Council, he does not automatically become eligible to claim

benefits in terms of the Employees Provident Fund Act.

Another reason given by the 1st Respondent in P26 to justify the

conclusion that the 4th Respondent was an employee entitled to

Employees Provident Fund benefits is that the 1st Petitioner had

issued an identity card to the 4th Respondent, describing him as

a Rate Collector of the Colombo Municipal Council. In the

absence of proper identification, the general public would not be

inclined to make default payments to Rate Collectors. The

18

warrants given to Rate Collectors signed by the Municipal

Commissioner is a similar factor. Such warrants confer

authority on Rate Collectors to emphasise compliance from the

public. Neither the said identity card nor the warrants have a

direct bearing on the employment status of the 4th Respondent.

These are not critical factors in deciding whether the 4th

Respondent was an employee or independent contractor.

The 1st Respondent in P26 says the 4th Respondent was part and

parcel of the Colombo Municipal Council, which may be meant

to suggest he played a pivotal role there. I am unable to accept

this. The services of the 4th Respondent would have been

helpful to the institution but cannot be said to have been an

integral part thereof. The job of a Rate Collector is limited to

collecting rates from defaulters, that also outside of the premises

of the Colombo Municipal Council. In the Agreements signed

between the parties, there is a clause to say The Rate Collector

shall not accept or collect any arrears of Rates in respect of a

warrant/demand notice issued to the Rate payer from any person

or persons who come to pay such arrears to Town Hall premises.

This shows the nature of the 4th Respondents job. Citizens

regularly pay rates to the Municipal Council. Dues of defaulters

are collected through independent contractors. Monies that

remain unpaid are recovered through legal action.

The 1st Respondent in P26 says the longstanding reciprocity of

obligations between the 1st Petitioner and 4th Respondent,

spanning 38 years, can be considered a service contract. The

relationship between the parties was premised on separate

Agreements entered into on a yearly basis. The services of the

4th Respondent were rendered on independent contracts which

19

cannot be said to form an employer-employee relationship in the

strict legal sense that would attract application of the

Employees Provident Fund Act.

In the unique facts and circumstances of this case, I take the

view that the relationship between the Colombo Municipal

Council and the 4th Respondent was not that of employer-

employee, but the 4th Respondent was only an independent

contractor of the Municipal Council. Hence the Employees

Provident Fund Act is inapplicable in this instance.

In view of the above finding, there is no necessity for me to

consider the applicability of sub-paragraph (c) of the First

Schedule to the Employees Provident Fund Regulations of 1958,

which, for the present purposes, says every employment other

than employment under any local authority (being a local

authority in respect of the employees of which a pension scheme

or provident fund has been established under any other written

law) shall be covered employment.

In view of my observations made at the beginning of this

Judgment in respect of P22, P26 and 1R6, the preliminary

objections taken up by learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent

on laches and the availability of alternative remedies are not

entitled to succeed.

Before I part with this Judgment, let me take the liberty to stress

the following. Learned Counsel for the 4th Respondent relies

heavily on two of my earlier Judgments on the same subject, i.e.

Sri Lanka Telecom PLC v. The Commissioner General of Labour

(CA Minutes of 22.11.2019) and Courtaulds Trading Company v.

The Commissioner General of Labour (CA Minutes of 05.03.2019),

20

and a Supreme Court Judgment, i.e. Sri Lanka Insurance

Corporation Ltd v. The Commissioner of Labour (SC Minutes of

14.12.2016), to argue that the 4th Respondent is an employee

and not an independent contractor. I regret my inability to come

to the same conclusion in this case but with good reason.

Although the principles of law involved are the same, the facts

are different.

A Judgment is only an authority for what it actually decides and

has no universal application to each and every subsequent case

on a similar issue, as the facts involved may substantially differ.

In Gunaratne Menike v. Jayatilaka Banda [1995] 1 Sri LR 152 at

157, Chief Justice G. P. S. de Silva remarked:

The principle laid down in a decision must be read and

understood in the light of the nature of the action, and the

facts and circumstances the Court was dealing with.

In Mary Beatrice v. Seneviratne [1997] 1 Sri LR 197 at 203,

Justice Senanayake quoted with approval the following pertinent

observation of Lord Halsbury in the House of Lords case of

Quinn v. Leathem [1901] AC 495 at 506:

[T]hat every judgment must be read as applicable to the

particular facts proved, or assumed to be proved, since the

generality of the expressions which may be found they are

not intended to be expositions of the whole law, but

governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in

which such expressions are to be found. The other is that a

case is only an authority for what it actually decides. I

entirely deny that it can be quoted for a proposition that

may seem to follow logically from it. Such a mode of

21

reasoning assumes that the law is necessarily a logical

code, whereas every lawyer must acknowledge that the

law is not always logical at all.

I quash the decision of the 1st Respondent contained in P22 and

the reasons for the said decision contained in P26 by certiorari.

The Petitioners are granted the reliefs as prayed for in

paragraphs (c)-(f) and (i) of the prayer to the petition.

The application of the Petitioners is allowed with costs.
