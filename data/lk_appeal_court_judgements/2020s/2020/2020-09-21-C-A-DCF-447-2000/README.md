Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this action against the Defendant in the

District Court of Embilipitiya seeking declaration of title to the

land described in the second schedule to the plaint, ejectment of

the Defendant from the land described in the third schedule

which is part of the land described in the second schedule to the

plaint, damages, and costs. The Defendant filed answer seeking

dismissal of the Plaintiffs action, declaration of title to the land

described in the schedule to the answer, compensation, and

costs. After trial, the learned District Judge entered Judgment

for the Plaintiff. Hence this appeal by the Defendant.

According to the plaint, the Defendant has been cultivating the

paddy land described in the third schedule to the plaint since

1985. The Plaintiff says she allowed the Defendant to cultivate

the paddy land on an oral agreement that the Defendant would

hand over 25 bushels of paddy per season to her as ground rent,

which he has refused to do since the 1989/90 maha season.

Even if this is true, such oral agreements, as opposed to notarial

executions, are obnoxious to section 2 of the Prevention of

Frauds Ordinance and have no force or avail in law.

The Defendant does not accept that he is a licensee of the

Plaintiff. His evidence is that he has been cultivating the paddy

land since 1978 and the said land belongs to the State. He has

produced several documents to substantiate this position.

3

The Plaintiff in his evidence produced the statement made by the

Defendant to the Gramaseva Officer on 01.03.1991 marked X1.

In this statement, the Defendant denies having taken the land

from the Plaintiff and says he bought it from Themanis on

10.07.1977, for which he has a receipt, and Themanis had

bought the land from the Plaintiffs husband, for which

Themanis has a receipt dated 03.06.1975. The Defendant

further says he has not paid rent to any person in respect of the

land and will not do so in future either.

The learned District Judge at page 3 of the Judgment

misconstrues the said position of the Defendant and says the

Defendant admitted in his statement to the Gramaseva Officer to

having obtained possession of the paddy land from the husband

of the Plaintiff and therefore the Defendant has entered into

possession of the land on the leave and license of the Plaintiff or

her husband.

It is settled law that had the Defendant entered into possession

of the land as a licensee of the Plaintiff, he could not have, in

law, questioned the Plaintiffs claim to ownership of the land

unless he had changed the character of possession by an overt

act as the starting point of adverse possession.

It seems the learned District Judge has assessed the evidence of

the Plaintiff as to the ownership of the land with the mind that

the Defendant is admittedly a licensee, which is not an admitted

fact.

In a rei vindicatio action such as this, the burden is fairly and

squarely on the Plaintiff to prove title to the land in the manner

pleaded in the plaint. There is no initial burden on the

Defendant to prove his title or right to possession. The

Defendant can remain silent until the Plaintiff accomplishes his

task.

In the instant case, the Plaintiff sets out her title in the plaint as

follows: the original owners of this land are Peiris Appuhamy

and Dionis Appuhamy. Peiris by Deed P1 transferred his rights

to the Plaintiff and Priyanthika, the latter not being a party to

the case. Dionis transferred his rights by Deed P2 to the

Plaintiff. The Plaintiff in lieu of her undivided rights possessed

the land described in the second schedule to the plaint and

acquired prescriptive possession of the land.

The land described in the first schedule to the plaint is 155

acres 2 roods and 3 perches in extent. The land described in the

second schedule to the plaint is about 10 acres in extent.

The land described in the third schedule to the plaint is about 2

acres in extent. None of the said portions of land have been

identified by way of a Plan.

Assuming Deed P1 is relevant to the land in question, of the 155

acres 2 roods and 3 perches, only an undivided 9/10 portion of

the undivided 10 acres has been transferred. By Deed P2, an

undivided 1 acres has been transferred.

The learned District Judge at page 2 of the Judgment says Peiris

Appuhamy by Deed P2 transferred 10 acres of land. This is

wrong. The learned District Judge has manifestly failed to

5

properly analyse the evidence of the Plaintiff as to the ownership

of the land.

If the two Deeds P1 and P2 are accepted, it is clear that the

Plaintiff is only a co-owner of the land. There is no evidence to

support the Plaintiffs claim that she separated a portion of the

co-owned land described in the second schedule to the plaint

and acquired prescriptive title to it. How can prescriptive title be

claimed to land in extent of about 10 acres? Prescriptive

title cannot be claimed to undivided rights. Prescriptive title can

only be established to a defined portion of land. But no such

defined portion was identified by the Plaintiff in this case

although the learned District Judge, by answering issue No.3

affirmatively, has come to the finding that the Plaintiff acquired

prescriptive title to the portion of land described in the second

schedule to the plaint, which is not correct.

The learned District Judge has not touched upon the evidence of

the acquiring officer of the Mahaweli Authority who says this is

not private land but land belonging to the Mahaweli Authority.

It is my considered view the Plaintiff has neither proved that the

Defendant who is admittedly in possession of the land in suit is

a licensee of hers, nor proved her own title to the property to the

satisfaction of the Court.

The Defendants cross claim to the property is not entitled to

succeed because the land, according to the Defendant himself, is

State land.

I set aside the Judgment of the District Court and allow the

appeal with costs. The Plaintiffs action in the District Court

shall stand dismissed.
