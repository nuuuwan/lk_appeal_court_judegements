Aggrieved by the conviction and sentence they have preferred

the appeal on the following grounds of appeal.

1. Has the Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself in

analyzing the evidence pertaining to the dying declaration?

2. Has the Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself when

he believed the purported eye witness notwithstanding the

various discrepancies in his evidence?

3. Has the Learned High Court judge misapplied the judgment

in Ajith Samarakoon Vs State to the facts of the present case

and there has been a miscarriage of justice?

4. Has the Learned High Court Judge unreasonably and

contrary to law rejected the defence evidence and thereby has

the accused appellants being deprived of a fair trial?

5. Has the Learned High Court Judge not properly considered

the defence evidence whereby the accused appellants

explained their absence from their residences soon after the

incident?

6. Has the Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself when

he convicted the Accused Appellants notwithstanding the fact

that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt?

Out of the SIX witnesses who have testified, PW 2 S.P

Dushantha Lakmal the son of the deceased has given evidence as

a purported eye witness who has been 13 years of age at the time

of the incident. He was 27 years old when he gave evidence before

the High Court.

He has given an account of what he saw on the fateful day

when he was returning home with the father (the deceased) around

3.30 pm after attending to work on a land, and when they were

walking on a path on the rubber land in close proximity to their

house as well as the houses of the accused (about 500 meters), the

two accused have confronted them, and seeing them, the deceased

father has advised him to run . He has explained that he went

back a few feet and then described the process which he saw at a

distance of 4,6 to 8 feet. (in page 137 of the Brief the distance he

has shown is recorded as 16 feet).

The 2 nd appellant has dealt a blow on the head and the 1 st

accused he identified as Kaduru Lokka has stabbed with a spear

on the right side of the stomach and he has seen the father pulling

away the spear (hella) and throwing it away, he has also witnessed

the 1st appellant attacking the deceased with a sword and the

fathers attempts to ward off the blows and then he has run home

to inform, first his brother then to his grandfather's house, where

he informed his uncle PW 1 Maddumage Don Bandula that his

father was fallen after being attacked by a hella by Kaduru Lokka.

I I I PW 1 Maddumage Don Bandula who is the brother-in-law of I

immediately rushed to the scene and had seen the injuries on the I

head, stomach and hand of the deceased, who is purported to have

I

said that it was Kaduru Lokka and his son who attacked him with

the spear and sword, but not to worry that he was alright and to

take him to hospital. The witness has also testified that when he

was rushing to the place of incident he saw the two accused, the

first accused with the spear and the second with a sword in his

hand, leaving that area about 200 to 300 meters from the place of

the incident. PW 1 has taken the injured to the hospital with the

wife of the injured and has lodged a complaint with the police.

In the evidence-in-chief of PW 1 he has admitted that he has

not mentioned the fact about seeing the two accused leaving the

vicinity of the scene or the purported dying declaration in the

police statement. But in cross examination he has explained that

what he stated to the police is what was informed by PW 2 to him

initially and that he only answered the questions put by the police.

However, that he has mentioned these facts at the non summary . . mquuy.

Omissions do not stand in the same position as

contradictions and discrepancies_ Thus, the rule zn

regard to consistency is not strictly applicable to

omissions_ "

There were omlSSlOns and a contradiction marked in the

evidence of PW 1 and PW 2: With regard to the omissions pointed

out by the defense in the evidence of PW 1 and PW 2, on a perusal

of them it is apparent that they do not affect the overall evidence

of the witnesses_ Some such omissions are PW 2's failure to state

that the father pushed him back telling him to run which are in

pages 151 and 153 of the brief. In page 110 of the brief that PW 1

has not informed the police that he tried to raise the injured to a

sitting position with the help of PW 2's brother and that he failed

to mention that Ravindra his own brother is the one who brought

the three wheeler.

The contradiction VI in page 111 relates to the fact that

although it was said that the injured was taken to the hospital in

a three wheeler, it transpired that after taking him in a three

wheeler for about 3 miles, thereafter, he was transferred to a van

and taken to hospital,

I ! , I i r I I i i ! i I The trial judge has concluded that the case for the I prosecution has not suffered due to these omissions.

I At the appeal the learned Pcesident', Coumel contended that

i the omissions are serious which the learned trial judge has failed I

I ! i i ,

to consider which has affected the credibility of the evidence of the

PW 1. With regard to the purported dying declaration, that it has

not been corroborated and that even if it is admitted that it does

not affect the 2nd accused appellant. And further, the evidence that

the two accused leaving the area of the incident although stated in

evidence has not been in the statement of the witness to the police.

However, It is noted that in page 519 of the brief in the non

summary proceedings, Bandula has stated " o~B8 lZ) ~DJ S Cl

e1S)ceC2l1 1fl.2l12:5)J 2Sl ';~ eCJ2:;l'2Sla 6~J ecd' 9 25)a lZ)~cJ" thus in the

purported dying declaration both the 1 st accused and the 2 nd

accused are mentioned as per the evidence of Bandula.

The statement of Bandula has been made soon after the

injured was entered to the hospital, in fact on the way back after

admitting the injured who died later in the night and thus, his

explanation that he told the police what was stated by PW 2 can

be plausible.

Taking in to consideration the Doctor's evidence that the

deceased would have been able to speak with the injuries , and

7

r----------:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------.-----------------------------, I ' i I

i

with the evidence of PW 1 describing the injuries he has seen and

being told not to worry but to take him to hospital by the injured

and the fact that at the magistrate inquiry he has evidenced about

the purported dying declaration, the trial judges' conclusion

cannot be faulted.

Although PW 1 was questioned at length, his testimonial

creditworthiness has not been affected with which conclusion of

the trial judge who saw the demeanour of the witness, this court

can agree . Therefore, this Court cannot agree that the learned trial

judge has misdirected himself in analysing the evidence pertaining

to the dying declaration.

Furthermore, the learned trial judge disregarding the

omissions and the contradiction and the reason why they were not

considered as important as it did not affect the root of the case,

cannot be considered as a misdirection of evidence.

The counsel for the accused has stated that the accused were

deprived of a fair trial as PW 3 was not called. It has been held over

and over again that there is no necessity to summon all the

witnesses who have been named. It is the learned President's

Counsel's contention that as the State Counsel in the evidence in

chief of the witness Bandula has led some evidence referring to an

incident where the first accused is said to have come to PW 3 's

house (father in law of the deceased) and made some utterances,

threatening his relations , that evidence should have been either

struck off or the witness should have been called. It appears that,

that evidence was not considered in the judgment of the learned

judge as he has not referred to this evidence in any manner,

therefore, it is apparent that this fact has not affected the case for

the appellants in an adverse manner, and no injustice has been

caused.

The counsel for the accused has commented on the learned

Judge applying the principle of Ajith Samarakoon vs the State to

the instant case where it is stated that when there is incriminating

evidence against the accused , the burden shifts to the accused to

explain away the incriminating evidence against them when they

had the opportunity to do so and that the failure of the accused to

do so in the instant case. The learned Counsel for the State has

conceded that it is a wrong conclusion in the instant case.

However, on that ground alone a conviction cannot be vitiated.

It is also to be contended that even if the evidence of PW 1 is

not considered that he saw the two accused leaving the scene of

the crime carrying a spear and a sword , there is still the strong

and unchallenged evidence of PW 2 that it was the two accused

who attacked the injured. The injuries are corroborated by

medical evidence.

PW 11 Dr Attygala has glVen evidence based on the post

mortem report of Dr Haregedera who was dead at the time of the

trial. Five injuries on the body has been noticed and injury No 3 is

stated as the injury that may have caused death, which is the

injury in the abdomen. PW 1 and PW 2 both have evidenced to the

injury in the abdomen. PW 1 expressed "C~Qh~ /'f)5)() D1ClcJ 8Clc.:lJ. @c

zS3~J . ~G@C ~DJCc.:lz:;f zS3~J ." which may have been caused by

stabbing using a sharp weapon and the cause of death in the post

mortem report is Hemorrhagic shock due to damage to right side

kidney II Multiple stabbing to transverse colon and small bowel.

The learned President's Counsel argued that it is not

probable for a 13 year old boy to be watching this incident and that

two views are possible, that is either that he ran as requested and

watched or if he ran could not have seen the incident.

PW 2 was 27 years old when he gave evidence and no

contradiction was marked in his evidence. He has been clear and

concise in his evidence.

Being a young boy seeing the father attacked in broad day

light in the above described manner would have been very

traumatic and difficult to witness and observe exactly how, when

and where the blows from the two accused landed.

In Page 151 of the brief some omissions that the father said

to run, and in page 152 the father pushing him to run was

highlighted. But apart from these not very vital omissions, the

evidence has been steadfast and no doubt was created regarding

his evidence.

It is seen that there was no immediate reason for the attack

I although it is in evidence that the two parties were not on talking I terms for a long period of time , it is contended by the appellants

that this case is fabricated against the appellants and that the

learned trial judge not considering that aspect is a miscarriage of

justice.

The defence is a plea of alibi. It is correct that the accused do

not have to prove anything. It is on the prosecution to prove beyond

reasonable doubt that it was the accused who were there at the

scene of the crime and no one else. The prosecution evidence PW

2 placed the two accused at the scene of the crime. PW 1 who came

soon after the incident gives evidence that he saw the two accused

leaving the area. Even if the evidence of PW 1 is disregarded the

evidence of PW 2 is sufficient to place the accused at the scene of

the crime.

On a perusal of the judgment it cannot be said that the

learned judge has not considered the Dock Statement of the 1 s t

accused, where he has stated that on the particular day around

According to PW 1, although the deceased and his family

were not good with the family of the accused, he had no issue with

them . It did not transpire in the evidence of the second accused

that Bandula PW 1 had some animosity with their family to have

given false evidence incriminating them.

After hearing of the death of the deceased without going to

the Horana Police they have surrendered to

three days after the incident on 1808.2004.

the Horana Courts

In the Dock statement the 1 st accused has clearly stated that

they heard shouts from the house of the deceased saying he and

his son assaulted him. And as the deceased family had so many

family members close by fearing they will be attacked they have

left their house. The police evidence establish that the two accused

were not in the vicinity soon after the attack.

PW 8 is the police officer who was first on the scene with two

other officers and were shown the scene of the incident by PW 1

and PW 2. On the information received although the police have

visited the house of the suspects he was unsuccessful in taking

them to custody.

admittedly since his mother's palm was injured long ago, the two

Although contended on their behalf by the Learned Counsel

there is no material before court that the accused were deprived of

a fair and impartial trial.

Considering the totality of the evidence before Court , the

learned trial judge has come to a finding that the prosecution has

established a strong and incriminating evidence against the two

accused, and that the prosecution has proved its case beyond

reasonable doubt.

In the circumstances, we see no merit in the contention

advanced on behalf of the accused appellants and see no reason

to interfere in the conviction or the sentence imposed by the

learned trial judge. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal of the

appellants.
