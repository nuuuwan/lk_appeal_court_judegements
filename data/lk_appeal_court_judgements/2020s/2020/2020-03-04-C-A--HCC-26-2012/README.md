Hon. Justice Achala Wengappuli

Accused-Appellant IS present In Court produced by the Prison

Authorities.

Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant invites this Court to

consider the circumstances under which the Accused-Appellant had

inflicted 19 injuries on the deceased. She had referred to the prosecution

evidence where one eye witness who had said that initially he saw the

deceased and the Accused-Appellant were talking to each other and then

at a later point of time they were grappling with each other. Then the

two of them had fallen into a nearby ditch in which the deceased had

sustained his injuries.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, who appeared for the

Respondent, concedes that it was a chance meeting and then in the

dock statement the Accused-Appellant had stated that he suspected the

deceased to be having an illicit affair with his wife. When he confronted

the deceased, the latter had uttered that he had physical relationship

with his wife even in the previous night and that had provoked the

Accused-Appellant. The Accused-Appellant who was an Army Soldier

serving in the operational areas at that time, had returned to his village

when this incident happened.

Judging by the circumstances, it appears that the suspected illicit

affair between the wife of the Accused-Appellant and the deceased gave

rise to this incident and then the utterance made by the deceased had

further angered the Accused-Appellant and he had lost his self control

on that sudden provocation after which he had inflicted the number of

stab injuries.

2

Therefore, we set aside the conviction entered by the learned High

Court judge on the Accused-Appellant for the charge of murder and

reduce the culpability to culpable homicide not amounting to murder

under the general exception of grave and sudden provocation.

Having considered the circumstances, attendant with the incident

and also the time period, the Accused-Appellant had spent in remand,

we impose 13 year period of rigorous imprisonment to be effective from

his date of conviction i.e. 28.03.2012.He will be imposed a fine of

Rs.5000 / - in default, there will be a six months of simple imprisonment.

If the imprisonment on default term is carried out that has to be

considered as a concurrent sentence.

The appeal of the Accused-Appellant is partly allowed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Hon. Justice Devika Abeyratne

I agree
