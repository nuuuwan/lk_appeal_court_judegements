T

here are 4 applications for judicial review out of which three namely CA Writ

86/20, CA Writ 87/20 and CA Writ 88/20 raise an identical issue.

The quintessential question that arises in these three applications is whether an oath or

affirmation that has to be taken or subscribed by a prospective candidate at the

Parliamentary Elections has to be administered by a person competent to administer

such oath or affirmation in terms of Section 15(2) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, No

1 of 1981 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Parliamentary Elections Act" or "the

Act"). This pivotal question can be posed in a number of ways. Is there a legal

requirement that the oath or affirmation as prescribed by Section 15(2) of the

Parliamentary Elections Act has to be taken before a person who is empowered to

administer such oath or affirmation? Is a self-administered oath or affirmation sufficient

for this purpose? Can a prospective candidate take or subscribe such oath or affirmation

on his own for purposes of Section 15(2) of the Act? Can he take the oath or subscribe

the affirmation in isolation and just sign below the oath?

24

The fourth application CA Writ 89/20 which pertains to the electoral c:listrict of Kalutara

raises a slightly c:lifferent issue. Upon a perusal of a true copy of the nomination paper

submitted by the party to contest the Parliamentary Elections in the Kalutara District, it

is quite clear that the identity of the Justice of the Peace OP) who has sought to attest

the nomination paper cannot be deCiphered with certainty. Only a signature of an

unidentified JP remains on the nomination paper with no seal being endorsed thereon.

This nomination paper has been rejected under Section 19(1)( e) of the Parliamentary

Elections Act for non-compliance with Section 15(3) of the said Act.

I must state at the outset that I propose to c:lispose of these two issues in one judgment.

As I said, the first issue is whether a Commissioner for Oaths must administer the oath

or affirmation of a prospective canc:lidate. Is the administration of oath necessitated by

Section 15(2) of the Parliamentary Elections Act? This issue arises in CA Writ 86/20

(Electoral District of Kurunegala), CA Writ 87/20 (Electoral District of Colombo) and CA

Writ 88/20 (Electoral District of Moneragala).

The second issue which pertains to attestation of the signature of the secretary of the

relevant party by an unidentified person arises in respect of the nomination paper

submitted in the Electoral District of Kalutara (CA Writ 89/20).

I shall first deal with the first issue which is the common denominator in respect of the

nomination papers submitted for the Electoral Districts of Kurunegala, Colombo and

Moneragala (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Kurunegala, Colombo and Moneragala). The

judgment will treat the facts surrounding the nomination paper submitted for the

District of Kurunegala as the template in order to deal with the identical issue that arises

in the other two applications pertaining to Colombo and Moneragala. Both the learned

President's Counsel Messrs. Romesh de Silva, PC and Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC along

with the learned DSG Viveka Siriwardena dealt with the nomination paper submitted

for Kurunegala in order to elucidate their arguments on the commonality of the core issue.

Mr. Thishya Weragoda who marked his appearance for the Petitioners in CA Writ 87/20

and CA Writ 88/20 submitted that the three applications (CA 86/20, CA 87/20 and CA

25

88/20) raise the same issue and associated himself with the contention of Mr. Romesh de

Silva, PC who appeared in CA 86/20.

CA 86/20 (Kurunegala), CA 87/20 (Colombo) and CA 88/20 (Moneragala)

The import of the letter dated nrd March 2020 addressed by the returning officer of the

Election Office, Kurunegala District, to the 1st Petitioner in CA (Writ) 86/2020 is to the

effect that the absence of the signature of the Commissioner for Oaths who should have

administered the oath or affirmation to the prospective candidates, from the nomination

paper, would amount to a non-compliance with Section 15(2) of the Parliamentary

Elections Act and thus the nomination paper is liable to be rejected in terms of Section

19(1)(d) of the Parliamentary Election Act. In a nutshell the rejection by the Returning

Officer is on the ground that no signature of the Commissioner for Oaths appears below

the signatures of three candidates in the Oaths or Affirmation part of the nomination

paper. As I said before, this feature is the common denominator in the other two

nomination papers submitted for Colombo and Moneragala. No Commissioner for

Oaths or someone competent to administer oath or affirmation has endorsed his

signature to establish the fact that the prospective candidates did take the oath or

subscribe the affirmation before him. A seal of an Attorney-at-law and

Commissioner for Oaths appears though at the bottom of the page containing the

purported oath of the three candidates for Kurunegala.

In that backdrop the application for judicial review [CA Writ 86/2020] seeks a Writ of

Certiorari to quash "the purported decision" of the 1st Respondent Returning Officer dated

nrd March 2020 in addition to a Writ of Mandamus that has been sought to compel the

Returning Officer of the Kurunegala Electoral District, to accept the nomination paper

submitted by the recognized political party of the Petitioners namely "Ape Janabala

Pakshaya". The other two applications (CA 87/20 and CA 88/20) seek identical remedies

thus seeking the rejected nomination papers to be accepted for Colombo and Moneragala.

26

In order to obtain the substantive relief of certiorari and mandamus in the main, the

Petitioners seek notice and an interim order suspending the decision to reject the

nomination paper.

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners has strenuously contended that

though the signature of the Commissioner for Oaths is missing in the oath or affirmation

part, the presence of the signatures of the candidates just below the format or content of

the Sixth Amendment oath or affirmation in the nomination paper shows that they have

taken or subscribed the oath or affirmation and this is sufficient compliance with Section

15(2) of the Parliamentary Election Act. It was a proper and compliant nomination paper

notwithstanding the absence of the signatures of the Commissioner for Oath in the oath

or affirmation part of the nomination paper. The act of signing below the oath or

affirmation in the nomination paper amounts to a complying oath-so argued Mr. Romesh

de Silva, Pc.

The standard form of nomination paper given to a recognized political party or an

independent group for the purpose of submitting their nomination paper requires the

signature of the Commissioner for Oaths before whom the candidates would take the

oath or subscribe their affirmation-see the Oaths and Affirmation component of a

standard nomination paper. If the signature of the Commissioner for Oaths or anyone

competent to administer the oath or affirmation appears with the notation that the

respective candidate took his oath or subscribed his affirmation before him, it is

definitely proof enough that such an oath or affirmation did take place before the

Commissioner for Oaths or anyone who was empowered to administer the oath or

affirmation. But Mr. Romesh de Silva the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners

argued that such a requirement of an oath before a Commissioner for Oaths is not

imposed by the Parliamentary Elections Act or the Constitution for the purpose of

contesting an election.

This contention was resisted by the learned Deputy Solicitor General Ms. Viveka

Siriwardena who appeared for the 1" and the 2nd Respondents and the Attorney-General.

Mr. Sanjeeva J ayawardena, the learned President's Counsel for the 11th Respondent, the

27

General Secretary of Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, whilst associating himself with the

contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General advanced the argument that the oath

or affirmation which is a constitutional oath introduced by the Sixth Amendment to the

Constitution carries with it a guarantee that the candidate for election has sworn to or

affirmed the sovereignty of the nation and as such Section 15(2) of the Parliamentary

Elections Act mandates this oath to be taken or subscribed by the candidate before a

Commissioner for Oaths who is competent to administer any such oath or

affirmation.

Preliminary Objections

In addition to these arguments on the merits, both the learned Deputy Solicitor-General

and Mr. Sanjeeva Jayawardena, PC raised preliminary objections as to the

maintainability of this application namely necessary parties have not been impleaded and

further in the words of the learned Deputy Solicitor General this Court stands denuded

of jurisdiction on the very perennial bar to jurisdiction that is oftentimes raised before us

viz there is no decision or determination that is amenable to supervisory jurisdiction.

The letter dated 23rd March 2020 rejecting the nomination paper is not a decision or

determination that attracts a quashing order (a writ of certiorari)-so ran the underlying

tenor of the argument.

Thus these applications for judicial review engages the interpretation of Section 15(2) of

the Parliamentary Election Act and the maintainability of these applications. Does

Section 15(2) carry with it a mandatory requirement that the oath or affirmation of a

prospective candidate at the Parliamentary Elections must be taken or subscribed before

a Commissioner for Oaths who is competent to administer such oath or affirmation? Did

the 1sr Respondent Returning Officer get it right when he rejected the nomination paper

on the ground that the signature of the Commissioner for Oaths was missing just after

the signatures of the candidates? It is axiomatic that if the Commissioner for Oaths has

placed his signature in the oath or affirmation part of the nomination paper, that would

establish that the candidates took their oath or affirmation in his presence. This was the

contention of the Deputy Solicitor General and Mr. Sanjeeva J ayawardene, PC in

28

contradistinction to Mr. Romesh de Silva, PC who asserted that there is no such

requirement of an administration of oath or affirmation by a Commissioner for Oaths

mandatorily prescribed by Section 15(2) to be taken or subscribed by a prospective

candidate. A self-oath or affirmation is compliant with Section 15(2) of the Parliamentary

Elections Act and it suffices if the candidate signs below the declaration of oath which is

pre-printed in the nomination paper ... so submitted the learned President's Counsel for

the Petitioners. The learned President's Counsel also raised an alternative argument. If

this Court were to hold against him on the question of the Commissioner for Oaths

having to administer an oath or affirmation, there was yet compliance with Section 15(2)

since the seal of the Commissioner for Oaths appearing in the oath/affirmation part of

the nomination paper would constitute substantial compliance with Section 15(2).

It is as plain as a pikestaff that if administration of oath or affirmation by a

Commissioner for Oaths is a concomitant requirement of Section 15(2) of the

Parliamentary Election Act, the evidence as to absence of administration of such oath or

affirmation from the nomination paper should entail a rejection of the nomination paper

in terms of Section 19(1)( d) of the said Act. Do the words "oath or affirmation" include an

administration of such oath or administration? This is the question for resolution by this

Court.

The ultra vires ground that Mr. Romesh de Silva, PC mounted in regard to the rejection of

the nomination papers by the Returning Officer flowed from the his argument of the

inessentiality of the requirement of the Commissioner for Oaths having to attest to his

administration of such oath or affirmation. The learned President's Counsel contended

that upon a perusal of Section 15(2) there is no such requirement of an administration of

oath or affirmation. ImpliCit in the argument is the assertion that the Returning Officer

acted ultra vires in insisting on such a requirement. The illegality argument of the learned

President's Counsel was run on these lines. As it turns out in all illegality arguments, the

notion of illegality involves an interpretation of a statutory power conferred on a

repository of such power.

29

Is administration of oath or affirmation an essential part of Section 15(2)? This is the core

question that requires interpretation.

I have set out the rival arguments on the legal issue that surfaces to the fore in the three

allied applications but before I proceed to assay them and arrive at a decision, let me

indulge in a brief narrative surrounding the facts and circumstances of the case in CA

writ 86/2020 which was adumbrated upon by all Counsel for clarity.

Admittedly the Electoral District of Kurunegala is the third largest Electoral District

which would return 15 members to the Parliament of the Republic. Section 15(1) of the

Parliamentary Elections Act, No 1 of 1981 states:-

"Any recognized political party or any group of persons contesting as independent candidates

(hereinafter referred to as an "independent group') may,for the purpose of an election of Members

of Parliament for any electoral district, submit one nomination paper setting out the names of

such number of candidates as is eqUivalent to the number of Members to be elected for that

electoral district, increased by three. Such nomination paper can be substantially in Form A set

out in the First Schedule to this Act."

Of the 13 recognized political parties that submitted their nominations for the electoral

district of Kurunegala, only 12 nominations were accepted and one nomination paper was

rejected. Of the 12 Independent Groups that submitted their nomination papers, 10

nomination papers were accepted and 2 were rejected. The Petitioners belong to a

Recognized Political Party known as "Ape J anabala Pakshaya" and out of the group of

nomination papers submitted by recognized Political Parties, it is only the nomination

paper of the Petitioners that was rejected by the Returning Officer. The 1st Petitioner is

the Secretary of the party, whilst the 2nd to 19th Petitioners were the candidates whose

names appeared on the nomination paper.

The impugned letter of rejection dated nrd March 2020 attributes the rejection of the

nomination paper to non-compliance of the nomination paper with Section 15(2) of the

Act which eventuates in that rejection in terms of Section 19(1)( d) of the Act. These two

provisions need to be juxtaposed. 30

Section 15(2)

The written consent of each candidate to be nominated by recognized political party or an

independent group and the board and all or affirmation, as the case may be, in the Form set out in

the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, taken or subscribed or made or subscribed, as the case

may be, by every such candidate, shall be endorsed on the nomination paper.

Section 19(1)(d)

The returning officer shall, immediately after the expiry of the nomination period, examine the

nomination paper received by him and reject any nomination paper-

(d) where the consent of one or more candidates nominated or the oath or affirmation, in the form

set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, of one or more candidates, has or have not been

endorsed on the nomination paper; or ..... .

Reduced to its bare essentials, Section 15(2) mandates two component elements to be

endorsed on a nomination paper.

1. The written consent of each candidate

2. An oath or affirmation, taken or subscribed or made or subscribed, as the case

may be, by every candidate,

The question before Court is whether the oath or affirmation in the form set out in the

Seventh Schedule to the Constitution (the Sixth Amendment Oath) must be taken or

subscribed by every candidate before a Commissioner for Oaths. Mr. Romesh de Silva,

PC contended that since Section 15(2) does not use the words "before a Commissioner

for Oathsn, the oath or affirmation need not be administered by a person competent to

administer such oaths or affirmations. The nub of the argument of Mr. Romesh de Silva,

PC is that a candidate can take this oath on his own and place his signature below the

oath, which would be sufficient compliance with Section 15(2) of the Act. The learned

President's Counsel contrasted Section 15(2) with Section 15(3) and contended that

while it is a requirement in Section 15(3) that each nomination paper shall be attested by

31

a Justice of the Peace or by a Notary Public, there is no such requirement in Section 15(2)

for an oath or affirmation to be administered.

The relevant oath or affirmation which was introduced by the Sixth Amendment to the

Constitution is in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and reads as follows:-

SEVENTH SCHEDULE

ARTICLE 157A AND ARTICLE 161(d) (iii)

"1... ................................................................... do solemnly declare and affirm

swear

that I will uphold and defend the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka and that I will not, directly or indirectly, in or outside Sri

Lanka, support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the

establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka."

This oath has been pre-printed in the standard nomination paper and 18 candidates (if

one takes the nomination paper for Kunmcgala) have placed their signatures just below

the format of the oaths and out of the 18 candidates who were on the nomination paper,

the Commissioner for Oaths has placed his signature for 15 candidates and this is

evidence that these 15 candidates took the oath or subscribed their affirmation before

him. It is notable that he has placed his signature for 15 candidates but not for 3

candidates. Thus the evidence is that 15 candidates took their oaths or subscribed their

affirmations before him but not the 3 candidates. This is the documentary evidence made

available to this Court by the learned Deputy Solicitor General. It is this error (non-

administration of oaths for three candidates) that has led to the rejection of the

nomination paper. In passing I must add that the Commissioner for Oath takes a

diametrically opposite stance to this documentary evidence when he states in his

affidavit before this Court that alll8 candidates took their oaths before him but due to

32

an inadvertence he may not have placed his signature before the names of the three

candidates (emphasis added). This stance contradicts the documentary evidence (the

nomination paper) and this belated explanation does not sound credible enough for

reliance and I will turn to this affidavit later in the judgment.

The reason for rejection of the nomination paper submitted for Kurunegala is that the

Commissioner for Oaths has not Signed for the three candidates signifying the

administration of the oath, whilst he has affixed his signature for 15 candidates.

According to Section 19(1)( d) of the Parliamentary Elections Act, the trigger for rejection

of a nomination paper is the non-endorsement of the oath or affirmation of one or more

candidates who stands nominated. Thus a defect in the oath or affirmation of one

candidate is sufficient to vitiate the whole nomination paper.

So what are the formalities for taking an oath or subscribing an affirmation that is

mandated by Section 15(2)? How does an oath or affirmation fail the formality prescribed

for an oath or affirmation within Section 15(2)?

Is the administration of oath or affirmation a component part of Section 15(2) though it

is not specifically mentioned in so many words in the Section? Mr. Romesh de Silva, PC

cited the case of Susil Premajayantha and Lalith U Gamage v. Dayananda

Dissanayake and two others (CA 84/2011, CA 78/2011, CA 110/2011 &: CA 133/2011)

wherein Sathya Hettige P.C J/PCA took the view (with Upaly Abeyrathne]. concurring)

in the Court of Appeal that in regard to Section 31(1)( d) of the Local Authorities

Ordinance, the rejection of a nomination paper by the Returning Officer, Akmeemana

Pradeshiya Sabha on the ground of the absence of an attestation of the Justice of the

Peace is not a ground of rejection.

The Court of Appeal in the case considered Section 31(1)(d) of the Local Authorities

Elections Ordinance which goes as follows:-

"The returning officer shall, immediately after the expiry of the nomination period, examine the

nomination papers received by him and reject any nomination paper-

(a) that has not been delivered in accordance with the provisions of subsection (5) of Section 28; or

33

(b) that does not contain the total number of candidates required to be nominated under subsection

(2) of Section 28; or

(c) in respect of which the deposit required under Section 29 has not been made; or

(d) where the consent of one or more candidates nominated has or have not been endorsed on the

nomination paper or where the oath or affirmation in the form set out in the

Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of one or more candidates has or have

not been annexed to the nomination paper; or"

The Court of Appeal interpreting the above provision took the view that the words the

oath or affirmation in the form set out in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution

of one or more candidates ... .in Section 31(l)(d) of the local Authorities Elections

Ordinance do not impose the interposition of a Commissioner for Oaths. With much

respect to the bench wruch made trus pronouncement, I am afraid that I would disagree

having regard to the follOwing considerations which that Court did not take into

cognizance in arriving at that decision.

The interpretation of Section 15(2) that necessitates the oath or affirmation of the

candidate to be endorsed on the nomination paper has to take into account necessarily

the words "oath or affirmation" in the section. Can a candidate take trus oath in

isolation and sign it rumself? Does it become an oath or affirmation when he takes or

subscribes it in isolation quite independently of a Commissioner for Oaths? I trunk not.

Metrunks the interposition of a Commissioner for Oaths is mandatory.

First, what is an oath? It has been differently described. In its ordinary sense, an oath is a

"form of attestation by wruch a person signifies that he is bound in conscience to perform

an act faithfully and truthfully." It is "a pledge by the person taking it that rus attestation

or promise is made under an immediate sense of responsibility to God." Similarly, an

affirmation in lieu of oath binds a person to live by what he undertakes. An oath of

allegiance or loyalty means that a person "promises and binds rumself to bear true

allegiance to a particular sovereign or Government and to support its Constitution ...... "

An oath or affirmation has been differently described.

34

Black's Law Dictionary (11th Edition Bryan A. Garner at p.l289) defines an oath to be a

solemn declaration, accompanied by a swearing to God or a revered person or thing, that

one's statement is true or that one will be bound to a promise.

This definition brings out the solemnity of an oath and imports an external agency to

whom the solemn declaration must be sworn. An affirmation is defined by Black's Law

Dictionary as a solemn pledge equivalent to an oath but without reference to a supreme

being or to swearing. Both attract the penalty of forgery if the oath or affirmation turns

out to be untrue. There must be a witness to an oath or affirmation who could speak to it

having been made. Otherwise one can disavow a sacred oath and yet claim that he took

the oath. One can deny sovereignty of a state and clam that he owes allegiance. He

cannot just sign below the format of the oath and claim that he took the oath. An oath or

affirmation by their intrinsic nature presupposes the oral declaration of the oath or

affirmation and signing it to signify its taking or subscribing. It cannot be taken in

secrecy. Thus there cannot be a self-pledge. It goes without saying that an oath or

affirmation as solemn as a pledge or promise has to be administered.

Bryan Garner makes it crystal clear in Black's Law Dictionary at p.73 -"while an oath is

"sworn to," an affirmation is merely "affirmed", but either type of pledge may subject the

person making it to the penalties for perjury. How can then one say that he can take the

oath or subscribe the affirmation in isolation when there has to be a witness to speak to

his oath or affirmation?

So I conclude that Section 15(2) of the Parliamentary Elections Act does not permit an

oath or affirmation to be effected in isolation but before a person competent to

administer the oath or affirmation.

I am also fortified in this interpretation having regard to oversees jurisprudence.

In American Jurisprudence (2nd Edition), it has been stated as under:-

"In its broadcast sense, an oath is any form of attestation by which a person

signifies that he is bound in conscience to perform an act faithfully and truthfully.

It involves the idea of calling in God to witness what is averred as truth, and it is

35

supposed to be accompanied with an invocation of His vengeance, or a

renunciation of His favour, in the event of falsehood. The word "oath" has been

construed to include "affirmation" in cases where, by law, an affirmation may be

substituted for an oath ..... It has been said that an oath is a solemn adjuration to

God to punish the affiant if he swears falsely. The sanction of the oath is a belief

that the Supreme Being will punish falsehood, and whether that punishment is

administered by remorse of conscience, or in any other mode in this work, or is

reserved for the future state of being, cannot affect that question, for the sum of

the matter is a belief that God is the avenger of falsehood."

Similarly, in "Corpus Juris Secundum":-

"An oath is an appeal by a person to God to witness the truth of what he declares

and an imprecation of divine punishment or vengeance on him if what he says is

false. Its purpose is to secure the truth. In its broadest sense, an oath includes any

form of attestation by which a party signifies that he is bound in conscience to

perform an act faithfully and truthfully, bur it does not include those forms of

attestation, which were not accompanied by an imprecation. It is sometimes

defined as an outward pledge given by the person taking it that his attestation or promise is

made under an immediate sense of his responSibility to God."

An outward pledge cannot be taken in secrecy nor could it be taken in isolation. Thus

Parliament in enacting Section 15(2) could not have intended the oath or affirmation to

be a self-execured pledge or promise.

In England, various officers of State have to take the oath of allegiance and the official

oath on assuming office. The lord Chancellor is one of them. The oath of allegiance alone

has to be taken by members of both Houses of Parliament on taking their seats, and by

certain other persons on entering, office or acquiring a special status.

In India, the Constitution makes it obligatory for the holders of offices of responsibility

to subscribe to the oath as prescribed. It provides for the administration of oath and lays

down the form of oath or affirmation for persons holding various Constitutional Offices.

36

In relation to a similar oath stipulated in Article 173 (a), Schedule 3, Form 3 of the Indian

Constitution, the Indian Supreme Court opined in V. Sutaria v. NP Bhavadia AIR 1970

SC 765 at 767 that the real purpose of the oath is that the person concerned must give an

undertaking to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution and uphold the

sovereignty and integrity of India. Similarly as in Sri Lanka, in the case of political offices,

even those seeking election to the Indian Parliament and State Legislatures have to

subscribe to the oath or make an affirmation in the prescribed form at the time of filing

the nomination paper. The forms of oath have been prescribed for the President, the

Prime Minister, the Chief Justice of India, the Controller and Auditor General, the

Members of Legislatures and the Judges etc. The obvious purpose is to ensure that the

person concerned makes a commitment to live by the constitutional process.

In Sri Lanka the Constitutional Oath introduced by the Sixth Amendment IS

peremptorily made mandatory for not only those aspiring to be representatives of the

people but several other office holders. The mandate of the oath is spelt out in Article

157 A of the Constitution whilst its format is given in the Seventh Schedule. Article 157 A

(S)(a) and (b) render the Seventh Schedule oath or affirmation mandatory not only for

Members of Parliament but also for those nominated as a Member of Parliament. So

when the mandate of Section 15(2) of the Parliamentary Elections Act declares that every

candidate must take the Seventh Schedule oath or subscribe to an affirmation and have it

endorsed on the nomination paper, he must demonstrate his allegiance to the

Constitution by scrupulously abiding by the form and mode of taking the oath.

The prospective candidate has to manifest in the nomination paper that he would uphold

the sovereignty and integrity of the country. A mere signature below the oath would not

suffice. Article 157 A(3) prescribes severe penalties for any person who acts in

contravention of the oath. It is to ensure the punctilious observance of a higher duty that

the Constitution lays down the oath. It is not a mere belief. If strict compliance is not

insisted upon, there would be no end to modifications or variations.

Undoubtedly the Seventh Schedule contains only the form of words. But it does not

prescribe the mode of taking oath or subscribing the affirmation. It goes without saying

37

that one has to look to an existing law for the mode and formalities of taking the Seventh

Schedule oath or subscribing the affirmation thereof.

Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance -the existing law

The mode of taking the oath or subscribing to the affirmation has to be prescribed in an

existing law and Article 170 of the Constitution defines an existing law and existing

written law to mean any law and written law, respectively in force immediately before

the commencement of the constitution which under the Constitution continue in force.

The uniformly applicable law "Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance" No.9 of 1985 as

amended declares that it is an ordinance to consolidate the law relating to oaths and

affirmations in judiCial proceedings and for other purposes. If the mode and formalities

for taking the oath or subscribing to the affirmation are not prescribed in the

Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act, it is to the Oaths and Affirmations

Ordinance one has to look for complying with Section 15(2) of the Parliamentary

Elections Act. Section 6 of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance states that all oaths

and affirmations for any other purpose shall be administered according to such forms

and with such formalities may be made by the Supreme Court and until such rules are

made, according to the forms and with the formalities now in use.

So administration of an oath or affirmation is made mandatory and Section 12(2) of the

Oaths and Affirmation Ordinance states that a Commissioner for Oaths may administer

any oath or affirmation and any such oath or affirmation administered or taken by a

Commissioner for Oaths shall in all legal proceedings and for other purposes have the

same effect as an oath, affirmation, or affidavit administered or taken before a Justice of

the Peace, and all enactments relating to oaths, affirmations, and affidavits administered

or taken before a Justice of the Peace shall, with the necessary modifications, apply

thereto:

Thus the existing law on oaths or affirmations exclude the possibility of an oath in

isolation and renders it mandatory that a Commissioner for Oaths or a Justice of the

Peace must administer such oath or affirmation.

38

The form of administration is spelt out in Section 12(3) of the Oaths and Affirmations

Ordinance which states that every Commissioner before whom any oath or affirmation is

administered, or before whom any affidavit is taken under this Ordinance, shall state

truly in the jurat or attestation at what place and on what date the same was

administered or taken, and shall initial all alterations, erasures and interlineations

appearing on the face thereof and made before the same was so administered or taken.

Thus the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance puts it beyond doubt that the prospective

candidate must take the oath or subscribe the affirmation before a Commissioner for

Oaths or a Justice of the Peace. I conclude that there must then be two signatures in

addition to the declaration of the oath or affirmation before the Commissioner for Oaths.

The prospective candidate must take the oath or subscribe to the affirmation and place

his signature. The Commissioner for Oaths must also place his signature attesting to the

administration of Oath or Affirmation. There must be strict compliance with this

mandate and an oath is not complete without administration. There can be no deviation

from this legal requirement which is conjointly imposed by the Constitution,

Parliamentary Elections Act and the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance.

The Parliamentary Elections Act does not take away the requirements of the Oaths and

Affirmations Ordinance from its operation. It is for this reason that Section 15(2) of the

Parliamentary Elections Act does not specifically refer to administration of oath or

affirmation. It is otiose for the Parliamentary Elections Act to refer to the requirements of

the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance. By the very nature of the oath or affirmation, the

Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance kicks in. Otherwise one can just sign below the oaths

without even reading it and say that he took the oath. A constitutional oath cannot be

just trifled with in such flippant observance.

That is why I observe that the previous decision of Susil Premajayantha and Lalith U

Gamage v. Dayananda Dissanayake and two others (CA 84/2011, CA 78/2011, CA

110/2011 &:: CA 133/2011) is in error as it has not considered the full import of an oath or

affirmation and in any event this case cannot be transposed on Section 15(2) of the

Parliamentary Elections Act. 39

,

Thus on the view that I have taken, the nomination paper that was filed by the party

represented by the Petitioners does not conform to the requirements of Section 15(2) of

the Parliamentary Elections Act.

let me now turn to the affidavit filed by the Commissioner for Oaths. He asserts that all

18 candidates took their oaths before him but due to inadvertence he may not have

placed his signature attesting to the oath-taking or affirmation.

We would be quite slow to accept the belated explanation of this Commissioner for

Oaths. He is in fact in a state of doubt when he states that he may not have placed his

signature by inadvertence. If he was inadvertent as he claims, it was open to him to go

before the Returning Officer in term of Section 8(1) of the Parliamentary Elections Act

and seek to correct such omission or error on the nomination paper but subject to

objections. Whether the failure to have the administration of oath or affirmation

endorsed on a nomination paper would amount to a curable omission is a matter for

which there is no decision from the Returning Officer. In such a situation, this Court will

be assuming an original jurisdiction to decide a primary fact, which does not fall within

supervisory jurisdiction. In such a backdrop I would reject the belated assertion of the

Commissioner for Oaths that he administered oaths and affirmations to all the

candidates. This contradicts the documentary evidence and the version does not induce

confidence in this Court.

Mr. Romesh de Silva, PC also argued that if this Court were to hold against him on the

requirements of Section 15(2), there was substantial compliance on the part of the

Petitioners as the seal of the Commissioner of Oaths is affixed on the oath or affirmation

part of the nomination paper. In our view the seal of the Commissioner of Oaths cannot

be a substitute for his signature.

S.N. Silva c.J in Ediriweera v. Kapukotuwa, General Secretary, United National

Party (2003) I Sri lR 228 made short shrift of the argument on substantial compliance.

In a nutshell he held that the stamp of the Secretary of the UNP found below the space

provided for the Secretary's signature would not amount to his signature.

40

...

4

I take the view that when the conjoined requirements of the Constitution, Parliamentary

Elections Act and the Oaths and Affirmations Act mandate an administration of oath or

affirmation, such solemn act cannot be established by a stamp of the Commissioner for

Oaths appearing so far away from the so called oaths in the nomination paper.

Having regard to the severity of sanction namely rejection of the nomination paper for

non-compliance with Section 15(2), there must be strict compliance with Section 15(2)

requirements for an oath or affirmation-namely, both the candidate and the

Commissioner for Oaths must affix their signatures in the space provided for their

signatures. Then only it becomes an oath that complies with Section 15(2). Otherwise it

is liable to be rejected under Section 19(1)( d) of the Act.

Preliminary objections

Though the above reasoning would dispose of these petitions on the merits, I would

briefly refer to the preliminary objections that were raised as to the maintainability of the

applications.

a. Necessary parties are not before Court

Not only the officer or authority to be compelled by mandamus, but also all persons who

would be affected by the issue of mandamus should be made respondents to the

application. Where mandamus was sought to compel the holding of the 2nd MBBS

examination only for the petitioners and 45 other students of the Faculty of Medicine of

the University of Colombo, to the exclusion of 115 students of the North Colombo

Medical College, it was held that "the 115 students of the North Colombo Medical

College are necessary parties and the failure to make them respondents is fatal to the

petitioners' application."- see Abayadeera v Dr.Stanley Wijesundera (1983) 2 Sri.LR

267, 285-292. In all the districts there are candidates who would be contesting the

elections from independent groups. In none of the applications these candidates have

been made Respondents. [f the nomination papers of the Petitioners were to be

accepted, that would definitely affect the rights of these contestants in the independent

groups and I would hold that the non-suiting of the candidates from thee independent

41

.. ..

groups in the petitions before this Court is fatal to these applications. Therefore even on

this ground these applications have to be rejected.

b) Ministerial Act

It is settled law that the Returning Officer does not make a decision when he proceeds to

reject the nomination papers under Section 19 (1) of the Act. If the conditions in (a), (b),

(c), (d) and (e) are satisfied, he shall reject the nomination paper-see Vigneswaran and

Stephen v Dayananda Dissanyake and Others (2002) 3 Sri.lR 59. The Returning

Officer has no discretion in the matter and he would only be performing a ministerial act.

A ministerial act may be defined to be one which a person performs in a given state of

facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of a legal authority, without

regard to, or the exercise of, his own judgment upon the property of the act done. Such

an act is not susceptible to certiorari.

In the circumstances, I take the view that there petitions should be dismissed in limine, as

the Petitioners have not made out a prima faCie case for issuance of notice and interim

relief.

Then the only application that remains to be considered is application bearing No CA

writ 89/2020 which relates to the nomination paper submitted for the Electoral District

of Kaluthara. As I said before, Section 15(3) requires the Secretary of a party to sign the

nomination paper and it shall be attested by a Justice of the Peace or a Notary Public.

The nomination paper does not give any indication as to who attested the instrument.

The Justice of the Peace is not identified with certainty as the signature of an unknown

person appears thereon. Moreover, the place of attestation is not specified and in terms

of Section 8 the failure to attest a nomination paper shall be deemed not to be an

omission. It also attracts the peremptory sanction of rejection in terms of Section 19(1)( e)

of the Act. It is on this ground that the nomination for Kalutara was rejected.
