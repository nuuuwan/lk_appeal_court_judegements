Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner, who states that it is carrying out its business in the name of Grand

Oriental Hotel,1 is a limited liability Company duly incorporated under the

Companies Act No. 7 of 2007.

In terms of Section 3(1) of the Budgetary Relief Allowance of Workers Act No. 4 of

2016 (the Act), with effect from May 1 2015, every employer in any industry or

service shall, in respect of each month pay to every worker employed by him, a

Budgetary Relief Allowance calculated at the rate specified in paragraphs (a) (e) of

that Section. Section 3(2) of the Act specifies the allowance that should be paid from

1st January 2016, onwards.

By a notice dated 19th July 2018 marked P2, the 2nd Respondent Assistant

Commissioner of Labour had directed the Petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs.

11,534,960 being the sum of money that the Petitioner should have paid by way of

an allowance to its employees, as required by Section 3(1) and Section 3(2) of the

Act, for the period set out therein.

Aggrieved by the said directive, the Petitioner had filed an appeal dated 31st August

2018 marked P3 with the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner admits that it was called

for an inquiry before the 2nd Respondent, where it took up the position inter alia that

the Petitioner is exempt from the payment of the said allowance to its employees.

Having afforded the Petitioner a hearing, the 2nd Respondent had issued an amended

directive marked P4 revising the sum mentioned in P2 and directing the Petitioner

to pay a sum of Rs. 10,416,709 before 22nd October 2018.

Aggrieved by P4, the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, seeking inter

alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said decision.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the major share holder of the

Petitioner is the Bank of Ceylon, and that in view of the definition of Industry and

Service in Section 14 of the Act, the Petitioner is not liable for the payment of the

1 Vide paragraph 1(a) of the petition.

said allowance. This was the only argument presented to this Court by the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner.

The words, Industry and Service have been defined as follows:

industry or service includes

(a) any trade, business, manufacture and agriculture, any undertaking or

occupation by way of trade, business, manufacture or agriculture and any

branch or section of trade, business, manufacture or agriculture;

(b) work or labour of any description whatsoever performed by persons in the

employment of a local authority, or of a corporation established by or

under any written law for carrying on an undertaking whether for

purposes of trade or otherwise;

(c) every occupation, calling or service of workers, and

(d) every undertaking of employers,

but does not include any industry, business or undertaking which is carried on

by any corporation, board or other body which was or is established by or

under any written law where the Government holds a majority of the share

capital with funds or capital wholly or partly provided by the Government by

way of grant, loan or otherwise; or any registered society within the meaning of

the Co-operative Societies Law, No. 5 of 1972;

The said definition in Sinhala reads as follows:

This Court, having carefully considered the above definition, is of the view that the

following requirements must be satisfied by the Petitioner if it is to be excluded from

the definition of industry or service, and thereby not be liable for the payment of

the said allowance:

a) The industry, business or undertaking must be carried out by any corporation,

board or other body which was or is established by or under any written law;

b) The Government must hold a majority of the share capital in the said industry,

business or undertaking with funds or capital wholly or partly provided by the

Government by way of grant, loan or otherwise

As noted at the outset, the Petitioner has admitted that the Petitioner is carrying out

its business in the name of Grand Oriental Hotel. Thus, on its own admission, the

business to which the Act has been applied, and to which P2 and P4 relates to, is

being carried out by the Petitioner, and not by the Bank of Ceylon. For the exclusion

to apply, the requirement of the Act is that the business must be carried out by the

entity in which the Government holds the majority of the shares. This Court is of the

view that the exclusion cannot be extended to entities where shares are not held by

the Government, but by entities in which the Government holds the majority of the

shares. Thus, this Court is of the view that the above exclusion does not apply to the

Petitioner, as the Petitioner has failed to meet the first requirement.

5

Furthermore, the requirement is that the majority of the shares must be held by the

Government in the entity that is engaged in the industry, business or undertaking.

While the Government holds the majority shares in the Bank of Ceylon, it is admitted

that it is not the Government, but the Bank of Ceylon that holds the majority shares

in the Petitioner. In the light of the above conclusion of this Court that the business

of the Grand Oriental Hotel is being carried out by the Petitioner, and not by the

Bank of Ceylon, it is the view of this Court that the Petitioner has failed to meet the

second requirement that must be satisfied in order to qualify for the exclusion.

This Court must also note that P2 and P4 refer to the Petitioner, and not the Bank

of Ceylon, as the employer. Furthermore, representations in P3 were made on

behalf of the Petitioner, and not the Bank of Ceylon, which confirms that it is the

Petitioner who is the employer. This too demonstrates that the provisions of the Act

have been made applicable to employees of the Petitioner, and not the Bank of

Ceylon.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General submitted that an employer can claim

the benefit of the above exclusion only if it is a corporation, board or body which is

established by or under any written law. He submitted that the Petitioner has been

incorporated in terms of the Companies Act and therefore does not satisfy the

requirement that it must be a body which is established by or under any written law.

However, the necessity for this Court to consider the said submission does not arise

in view of the above conclusion of this Court.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue notice of

this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed,

without costs.
