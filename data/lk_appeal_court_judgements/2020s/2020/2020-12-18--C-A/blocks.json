'Nemo dat quod non habet' principle is apt here and accordingly no one can give what he does not have or no one can transfer better title than he himself had. Also the maxim 'caveat emptor, qui ignorare non debuit quod jus aliemun emit' (let a purchaser beware; who oUght not to be ignorant that he is purchasing the rights of another - vide Pawittar Singh Walia vs Union Tern'tory on 21.11.2012 Civil Writ Petition No. 22898 of 2012- Punjab- Haryana High Court) is attracted in the present case as well as in the matters under the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act. I believe these should be read in line with the premise under which the said Act was enacted.
