This application is connected to CA/WRIT/191/2013, in which

the Judgment was delivered today.

As the background facts are the same, I will not repeat them

here except for clarity.

The 3rd Respondent by P2 complained to the 1st Respondent

Commissioner General of Labour on two matters: (a) non-

payment of salary from March 2009 to August 2009, and (b)

non-payment of gratuity from 1988 to 2009 by the Petitioner

employer.

Non-payment of salary was the subject matter of

CA/WRIT/191/2013.

The instant matter relates to non-payment of gratuity.

3

The events pertaining to the inquiry into non-payment of salary

and the Order delivered thereon by the 1st Respondent are

explained in the Judgment in CA/WRIT/191/2013. In the said

Order of the 1st Respondent, the issue of non-payment of

gratuity was not addressed. The 1st Respondent in his

objections says this is due to an oversight.

Whilst CA/WRIT/191/2013 was pending, the 1st Respondent

had inquired into this matter and made the Order dated

25.08.2017 marked P38, whereby the Petitioner was directed to

pay the 3rd Respondent gratuity in a sum of Rs. 2,719,034.50 for

the 14-year period of the 3rd Respondents employment in the

Petitioner company from 12.10.1994 to 20.08.2009.

Although the P38 Order was made on 25.08.2017, the Petitioner

filed this application on 01.02.2018 five months after the

Order. There has been a delay in filing this application. The

Petitioner knows this, but endeavours to cover it up by

highlighting P37 dated 10.01.2018 as the main document to be

quashed by certiorari and tendering P38 as a secondary

document, when in fact the Order sought to be quashed is

contained in P38 which the Petitioner received several months

earlier vide P34.

The Petitioner seeks both P37 and P38 to be quashed by

certiorari.

The Petitioner says the following in paragraph 37 of the petition:

Thereafter, the Petitioner received letter dated 10.01.2018

sent by the 2nd Respondent directing the Petitioner to pay a

4

sum of Rs. 2,719,034.50 as gratuity. The said letter is

annexed hereto marked P37 and letter dated 25.08.2017 is

annexed hereto as P38 and is pleaded as part and parcel of

this petition and affidavit annexed hereto.

It is erroneous to say the Petitioner received letter (P37) dated

10.01.2018 sent by the 2nd Respondent directing the Petitioner to

pay a sum of Rs. 2,719,034.50 as gratuity. P37 only directs the

Petitioner to pay gratuity in accordance with the determination

dated 25.08.2017 (P38).

In my view, this is a distortion of material facts, which alone

disentitles the Petitioner to the relief sought.

Delay is also a ground for refusal of relief. Delay as a bar to

relief in a writ application shall be decided on a case by case

basis.

Be that as it may, let me now consider the grounds on which the

Petitioner challenges the impugned Order for payment of

gratuity. The Petitioner sets out four reasons in paragraph 38 of

the petition.

Firstly, the Petitioner says the 1st Respondent could not have

made the said Order when the question of whether the 3rd

Respondent was an employee of the Petitioner company was

pending adjudication before this Court in CA/WRIT/191/2013.

This is not an acceptable objection. The impugned Order in

CA/WRIT/191/2013 is in relation to arrears of salary. The

present Order is in relation to payment of gratuity.

5

Secondly, the Petitioner says the Order was made in violation of

the principles of natural justice inasmuch as the Petitioner was

not given an opportunity to produce evidence that the 3rd

Respondent was never an employee of the Petitioner company.

The principal submission of the Petitioner at the argument was

that the impugned Order on gratuity was made without an

inquiry. This is belied by the Petitioners own documents. In

paragraph 14 of the statement of objections, the 1st Respondent,

having admitted that the gratuity claim was not inquired into

due to an oversight at the first inquiry, states in subparagraph

(iv) Accordingly, the Petitioner was summoned for inquiry and

several occasions the inquiry was held and parties were allowed

to file their respective written submissions. Although the

Petitioner in the counter affidavit denies this and emphatically

states no written submissions were filed, P34 dated 25.08.2017

produced by the Petitioner itself, makes it abundantly clear

written submissions were in fact filed. This means the

impugned Order was made after hearing the Petitioner. The fact

that the Petitioner did not tender the relevant documents at the

inquiry is beyond the control of the 1st Respondent.

Thirdly, the Petitioner says the impugned Order is contrary to

the law, as it was made nearly five years after the complaint of

the 3rd Respondent. The complaint P2 had been made in

February 2013 and the first inquiry was held in May 2013. As

already stated, the 1st Respondent did not address the gratuity

claim in the impugned Order delivered pursuant to the first

inquiry due to an oversight. The second inquiry was held in

August 2017. There is no time limitation for inquiry into

6

gratuity claims under the Payment of Gratuity Act, No.12 of

1983, as amended. Hence this argument is unsustainable.

The final point the Petitioner makes is, since the 1st Respondent

did not make a ruling on gratuity in the first Order, the 1st

Respondent had no authority to make an Order in respect of

gratuity several years later. This cannot be accepted for the

reasons mentioned in relation to the third submission above.

The application of the Petitioner is dismissed with costs.
