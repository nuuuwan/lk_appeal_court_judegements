Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 3rd Respondent employee joined the Petitioner, the Ceylon

Electricity Board, on 14.07.1977 as a Clerk and was thereafter

appointed as an Internal Audit Assistant (salary scale K5) on

05.06.1994. From 05.06.1994, the 3rd Respondent had not been

promoted for twenty years. In 2004, he complained of this

matter to the Ombudsman1 and also to the Political

Victimisation Committee.2 The Political Victimisation Committee

held an inquiry into the matter and made a recommendation

that the 3rd Respondent be promoted to the post of Internal

Auditor (salary scale K4) with effect from 01.10.2004.3 This

recommendation was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers and

the Ceylon Electricity Board gave effect to the Cabinet decision.

Thereafter, in 2006, the 3rd Respondent reagitated the matter

and urged the 1st Respondent Commissioner General of Labour

to give effect to the said promotion from 05.06.1990, claiming he

was entitled to be promoted to the post of Internal Auditor after

six years of service in his previous position of Internal Audit

Assistant.4

The Commissioner General of Labour held an inquiry into this

complaint and a settlement was reached between the employer

and employee to backdate the said promotion to 31.05.1999.5

However, the Ceylon Electricity Board later resiled from this

settlement, stating to the Commissioner General of Labour that

such an agreement is tantamount to overriding the Cabinet

decision, which cannot be done.6

It is in this context the 4th Respondent Minister, by virtue of

section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, referred this dispute

for arbitration.

At the arbitration proceedings, the Ceylon Electricity Board had

taken up a preliminary objection that, in light of the Cabinet

decision, the Arbitrator lacks jurisdiction to inquire into the

matter. But the Arbitrator overruled the said objection and,

having proceeded with the inquiry, made the impugned decision

dated 29.06.2015 backdating the said promotion to 05.06.1990,

on the basis the 3rd Respondent should have been promoted to

the post of Internal Auditor after exactly six years of service as

Internal Audit Assistant. However, even according to the 3rd

Respondent, in terms of the relevant circulars, internal audit

assistant (K5) should be promoted to the post of internal audit

(K4) after 6-year service, after an exam and interview held by the

Petitioner.

It is against this decision of the Arbitrator that the Petitioner has

come before this Court seeking it to be quashed by certiorari.

The pivotal argument of the Petitioner is the Minister could not

have referred the dispute for arbitration nor could the Arbitrator

have decided the matter because such a reference and/or

decision is in sharp conflict with the said Cabinet decision made

6 Vide page 42 of X1.

on the recommendation of the Political Victimisation Committee.

It is not the position of the 3rd Respondent that although the

dispute is the same, the Arbitrator could revisit the matter and

make an order. Rather, the 3rd Respondents contention is the

application to the Political Victimisation Committee was made

purely due to the 3rd Respondent being subject to political

victimisation and the application made to the Commissioner

General of Labour and later referred to Arbitration was purely

based on Petitioners failure to implement relevant circulars, and

therefore there is no conflict between the two grievances. In the

facts and circumstances of this case, I am unable to agree.

In fact, although the 3rd Respondent complained to the Political

Victimisation Committee, his complaint makes no mention of

political victimisation. Rather, the said complaint pertains to

grave injustice caused to him due to the inefficiency of the

management of the Ceylon Electricity Board, which compelled

him to stagnate in the post of Internal Audit Assistant (salary

scale K5) for twenty long years. The said complaint refers to the

non-implementation of the relevant circulars as well. The

argument of the 3rd Respondent that the complaint made to the

Arbitrator was different from the complaint made to the Political

Victimisation Committee is therefore unsustainable.

Let me quote in full the complaint of the 3rd Respondent sent to

the Political Victimisation Committee for better understanding.

It may be relevant to note that in his complaint to the

Commissioner General of Labour,8 which was made after the

Cabinet decision, the 3rd Respondent does not say other

employees of his service, i.e. the Internal Audit Assistant service,

were promoted upon six years of service. Rather, he says

employees in parallel services were promoted upon six years of

service. In the said complaint, the 3rd Respondent admits a

promotion scheme for the Internal Audit Assistant service was

first introduced by circular dated 31.05.1999.

In the award sought to be quashed, the Arbitrator has referred

to the promotions of three other officers of the Ceylon Electricity

Board having been backdated, upon the recommendations of the

Human Rights Commission, beyond the Cabinet decision.9 The

Arbitrator places great weight on this matter in rejecting the

7 Vide page 493 of X1. 8 Vide page 37 of X1. 9 Vide pages 8-9 of the arbitration award marked P2.

8

argument of the Ceylon Electricity Board that to backdate the

promotion of the 3rd Respondent would effectively override the

Cabinet decision. The 3rd Respondent also takes this point to

the forefront and emphasises: (The Petitioners) Ceylon

Electricity Boards position that they have no power to backdate

the applicant beyond the date which the Political Committee

Report recommended which has been approved by the cabinet

cannot sustain inasmuch as the Board has acted contrary to the

said stand in a different manner with regard to other officers and

no explanation has been given with regard to such promotions.

With regard to the said promotions of the other three officers,

the Arbitrator refers to the documents marked R23-R26.10

However when I read these documents, it is clear the Arbitrator

has manifestly misconstrued them. The recommendation of the

Human Rights Commission in respect of the said three officers is

as follows:

The said [political victimisation] committee explored their

grievances and recommended very clearly that the

appointments of the complainant and others in the same

batch be backdated to 02.05.1995 the date on which they

would complete the six years. (P1)

But the management of the CEB amended the said

recommendation and implemented from 01.04.1998. (P2)

By considering the foregoing the Human Rights Commission

observes that the Respondent Board treated the employees

in the two batches differently and thereby created an

10 Vide pages 530-541 of X1.

9

anomaly among the said employees and the said anomaly

had violated the fundamental rights of equal protection of

law guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution. In

the circumstances, the Human Rights Commission

recommends that the complainants appointment which

carries the salary scale of K4 be backdated to be effective

from 02.05.1995 and adjust the salary accordingly.11

It appears, contrary to what the Arbitrator states, the Human

Rights Commission recommended that the Ceylon Electricity

Board implement the Cabinet decision without varying it. In

other words, the Human Rights Commission recommended

backdating the relevant promotions strictly in line with the

Cabinet decision made on the recommendations of the Political

Victimisation Committee. The Ceylon Electricity Board enforced

the said recommendations of the Human Rights Commission

and the promotions of the three officers were backdated

accordingly. This misconstruction of the Human Rights

Commission recommendations with regard to the said three

officers has largely influenced the Arbitrator to hold against the

Ceylon Electricity Board in the instant dispute.

The above quoted recommendation of the Human Rights

Commission further highlights that the Political Victimisation

Committee made recommendations based on the unique facts

and circumstances of each individual case. This is clear from

the report of the Political Victimisation Committee found in the

record.12 In respect of the other three employees, who were not

11 Vide page 534. 12 Vide page 500-517 of X1.

10

in the same service as the 3rd Respondent (i.e. the three

employees highlighted by the Arbitrator and the 3rd Respondent),

the Political Victimisation Committee recommended they be

promoted upon completion of six years of service. The Political

Victimisation Committee did not make the same

recommendation in respect of the 3rd Respondent, perhaps for

different reasons. This Court is not mandated to look into that

matter.

In light of the Cabinet decision already made in respect of the

effective date of promotion of the 3rd Respondent, the Minister

could not have referred the matter for arbitration and the

Arbitrator could not have backdated the said promotion, thereby

overriding the Cabinet decision.

The 3rd Respondent has taken up two preliminary objections.

The 1st preliminary objection is the former Minister who referred

the dispute for arbitration has not been cited by name and

instead the present Minister has been made a party, and

therefore the application of the Petitioner shall be dismissed in

limine. The Minister was performing an official act; he cannot be

held personally liable for such an act and therefore naming his

successor is sufficient compliance in terms of the Court of

Appeal Rules. In any event, the relief sought is certiorari

quashing the reference for arbitration by the Minister;

mandamus is not sought.

The second preliminary objection is Petition of Appeal has not

been filed by the Attorney-at-Law on record; therefore no valid

Petition of Appeal is before Court. There is no Petition of Appeal

11

in the instant case. This is a writ application. The names of

several Attorneys-at-Law appear on the proxy and it has been

signed by one of them. This is sufficient compliance. In any

event, such a defect of the proxy is curable.

I overrule the above preliminary objections.

I quash the reference for arbitration by the Minister in P1(a) and

the award of the Arbitrator marked P2 and P3 by way of a writ of

certiorari, on the basis that both acts are ultra vires.

The reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer

to the petition dated 14.01.2016 are granted. The application of

the Petitioner is allowed but without costs.
