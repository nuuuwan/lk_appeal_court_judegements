The appellant Udiyawela Hakirinige Pushpa Kumara

Jayasinghe has preferred this appeal seeking to set aside the order

of the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura dated 01. 12.2016

and the order of the learned Magistrate of Rakwana dated

22.01.2014 wherein the vehicle in issue was confiscated.

The two accused respondent-respondents (hereinafter

sometimes mentioned as the accused) were charged for committing

an offence under section 25 (2) of the Forest Ordinance to be read

with section 40 (1) (b) of the said Act for transporting 30 logs of

timber without a valid permit.

They were convicted on their own plea and a fine of Rupees

20,000 each was imposed, carrying a default sentence of one

month's simple imprisonment.

At the vehicle inquiry in respect of the Lorry bearing

registered number, WACA 2859, the registered owner claimant

petitioner appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) who

claimed the vehicle as the owner of the vehicle, on 09.01.2013 has

concluded his evidence. When the case was fixed for further

inquiry for 22.01.2014, due to the non-appearance of the appellant

on that day, the learned Magistrate has held that it indicated his

disinterest in the proceedings and made order to confiscate the

lorry.

5 t , , , , , , , , L _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 1

Aggrieved by the order of the learned Magistrate a Revision

Application HCR/RA/54/2014 was preferred to the High Court of

Ratnapura. The preliminary objection raised on behalf of the State

on the maintainability of the application due to the delay in filing

the Revision Application was overruled on 5.11.2015 on the basis

that the property rights of the petitioner should not be lightly

measured and the petitioner was allowed to proceed with the

application.

Subsequently, after inquiry the Revision Application was

dismissed on 01.12.2016 by the High Court.

Aggrieved by the dismissal of the Revision Application, the

appellant has preferred this appeal.

The Appellant has invited this Court to address the following

questions of law for determination.

1. Whether the petitioner's application should be dismissed

on ground of laches;

11. Whether the Learned magistrate had erred in deciding to

confiscate the subject vehicle without considering the

evidence already placed on record.

It is noted that the Revision Application to the High Court of

Ratnapura is submitted on 20.10.2014 approximately 10 months

after the order of the learned Magistrate dated 22.01.2014. The

Preliminary Objection by the State Counsel was that the applicant

6

r-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, , , , ! , , , ,

due to the delay in submitting same was guilty of laches and the

application should be dismissed in limine.

However, as stated above, by order dated 15.11.2015 the

Preliminary Objection was overruled and that order was not

canvassed. Thus, the necessity of re- visiting that issue does not

arIse.

The question to be determined by this Court is whether the

order of the learned Magistrate should be allowed to stand.

The amendment to Section 40 (1)(b) of the Forest Ordinance

provides as follows;

Where any person is convicted of a forest offence.

(A) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in respect of which the offence has been committed, and (B) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in committing such offence

Shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be confiscated by order of the convicting magistrate.

Provided that where the owner of the vehicle is a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such tools, Vehicles ,implements, cattle and machines, as the case may be, for the commission of the offence.

Thus, it is apparent that there is provision for the owner of a

vehicle used in the commission of an offence relating to the Forest

Ordinance to satisfy Court that he/she has taken all necessary

precautions to prevent the commission of such offence.

Complying with the said provision, the learned Magistrate

has given an opportunity to the appellant to show cause why the

alleged vehicle should not be confiscated. Accordingly, the

appellant has testified and his evidence has been concluded on

9.1.2013 and the inquiry has been postponed for 20.03.2013.

On a perusal of the Journal Entries it appears that on the

dates fixed for inquiry, 20.03.2013 and 24.04.2013, the registered

owner (the appellant) has not appeared in Court. However, on

21.08.2013 he has been present and the inquiry has been re-fixed

for the 22.01.2014 on which day the appellant has again failed to

appear in Court and his Attorney has informed he has no

instructions from his client and the impugned order has been

made forthwith which reads as follows;

The learned Magistrate who made the order of confiscation

1S not the learned Magistrate before whom the evidence of the

registered owner has been recorded.

It is clear from the journal entries that the appellant has not

been vigilant about the proceedings before Court and there is

slackness, negligence and neglect on his part. This may be due to

the fact that the vehicle in question being released to him on a

bond.

However, the case record bears testimony to the fact that an

inquiry was held according to law and the main claimant in an

inquiry of this nature has concluded his evidence.

On a perusal of the order of the learned Magistrate it is

patently obvious that the evidence of the appellant has not been

considered at all. It is not clear whether the learned Magistrate was

9

aware that there was existing evidence of the claimant before

court, which the Court is bound to consider before making an

order of confiscation.

It appears from the order dated 22.01.2014, that

confiscation of the said vehicle is based only on the ground of the

appellant not being present on the inquiry dates. This clearly is an

erroneous order which is a question of law the appellate court has

to consider. It is obvious that the failure of the learned judge not

considering the evidence before Court can pave way to a grave

miscarriage of justice.

It is regrettable that the learned Magistrate who made order

on 22.01.2014 has not acted judicially by not considering the

evidence recorded before his predecessor before making the order

to confiscate the vehicle. There is no evaluation at all of the

available evidence. Thus, it is my considered view that the learned

judge has erred by ignoring the evidence on record and the failure

to evaluate that evidence which is the most important aspect in an

inquiry of this nature cannot be accepted.

In the Revision Application before the High Court of

Ratnapura, in a very short order of 2 pages, the learned High Court

Judge has, agreeing with the view of the learned Magistrate

affirmed the order of confiscation.

10

~ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ J

It is trite law that in a reVISIOn application the appellant is

required to demonstrate the existence of exceptional

circumstances.

In Rasheed Ali Vs Mohomed Ali (1981) 2 SLR Page 29 it was

held;

"The powers of revision conferred on the Court of

Appeal are very wide and the Court has the discretion

to exercise them whether an appeal lies or not or

whether an appeal had been taken or not. However,

this discretionary remedy can be invoked only where

there are "exceptional circumstances" warranting the

investigation of the Court. Although the Courts have

not attempted to define the expression "exceptional

circumstances" the authorities show the guide lines

which had been laid down ..... "

In Bank of Ceylon Vs Kaleel and others 2994 1 SLR 284 ,

Wimalchandra,J has held;

In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction

the order challenged must have occasioned a failure of

justice and manifestly erroneous which go beyond an

error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person

would instantly react to it. The order complained of is

of such a nature which would have shocked the

conscience of court".

It is apparent that the evidence of the appellant has not been

considered by the learned magistrate in the instant case. The

learned High Court judge has passingly mentioned about the

appellant's submission that his evidence has not been considered

by the learned Magistrate, not much consideration or importance

has been given to that submission. For easy reference a portion of

the order of the learned High Court judge is reproduced below.

It is my considered opinion that the learned High Court judge

has not given his mind to the fact that a vehicle confiscation

inquiry had commenced and that the registered owner who has to

satisfy Court why the vehicle should not be confiscated, has

concluded his evidence and that there was a legal duty and an

obligation on the learned Magistrate to consider the existing

evidence before making the order to confiscate the vehicle.

The learned High Court judge has without considering this

most important issue, has gone on to consider the delay in

submitting the Revision Application also as a ground to dismiss

same. It has been held many authorities that delay alone ought

not to be a ground of dismissal of a revision application when

important legal issues are to be considered.

As stated earlier in the order, the issue of laches was resolved

by the order dated 5.11.2015 of the predecessor High Court judge

and as that order was not canvassed before a higher forum, the

High Court judge was not entitled to revisit same. Therefore, there

was no necessity for the learned High Court Judge to consider

'laches' as a ground to dismiss the revision application.

13

I l _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ l

The appellant has referred the following authorities for

consideration of Court.

Caroline Nona and others vs Singho and others (2005) 3 SLR

176 where it held;

If the impugned order or part of the judgment is

manifestly erroneous and is likely to cause grave

injustice the court should not the application on the

ground of malice alone.

Biso Menike Vs Cyril de Alwis (1982) 1 SLR 378

when the court has examined the record and

IS satisfied the order complained of manifestly

erroneous or without jurisdiction the Court would be

loath to allow the mischief of the order to continue and

reject to application simply on the ground of delay,

unless there are very extraordinary reasons to justify

such rejection. Where the authority concerned has

been acting altogether without basic jurisdiction, the

court may grant reliefin spite of the delay unless the

conduct of the party shows that he has approbated the

usurpation of jurisdiction. In any such event, the

explanation of delay should be considered

sympathetically. "

In the above circumstances, the questions of law posed by the

appellant are answered as follows;

14

, , , , , , , , , , 1 , , , , , , L _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 1

1. The petitioner's application should not be dismissed on the

ground of laches.

2. The learned Magistrate has erred by not considering the

evidence on record when he decided to confiscate the subject

matter.

Considering the circumstances of the instant case, I am of the

view that the confiscation of the vehicle was not on a legally

accepted premise and therefore, the order cannot be allowed to

stand. As such the order of the learned High Court judge dated

01. 12.2016 and the order of the learned Magistrate dated

22.01.2014 is set aside.

The learned Magistrate is directed to consider the evidence of

the appellant recorded at the claim inquiry which is on record and

make an appropriate order according to law.
