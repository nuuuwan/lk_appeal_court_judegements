The 1st Defendant-Respondent-Petitioner(Petitioner) by petition dated 15.12.2016 invoked the

revisionary and/or restitutionary jurisdiction of this court and sought inter alia to revise and set

aside the judgment of the learned High Court Judges of the High Court of Civi l Appellate of the

Western Province holden in Colombo dated 30.08.2016 in Case No. WP/HCCA/COL/99/2011(F)

and to affirm the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Colombo dated 03.06.2011

in Case No. 36408/MR.

The Plaintiff-Appellant-Respondent (Respondent) instituted the case bearing no. 36408/MR in

the District Court of Colombo praying for a judgment and a decree jointly and severally against

the Petitioner and 2nd and 3rd Defendants-Respondents-Respondents in a sum of Rs. 829,205/=

with interest at 60% per annum from 22.06.2002 until payment in full and for the return and

delivery of the lease property or the payment of its value in a sum of Rs. 500,000/=.

The Petitioner filed his answer on 10.11.2005 and denied liability to pay the Respondent on the

basis that the leased property was seized by the original owner on 25.01.2002 (who is not the

Respondent) and moved for a dismissal of the action.

After trial, the learned Additional District Judge delivered judgment dated 03.06.2011 dismissing

the action and ordered costs at 250% in terms of section 211 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Being aggrieved, the Respondent preferred an appeal to the High Court of Civi l Appellate of the

Western Province holden in Colombo and the learned High Court Judges, by the judgment dated

30.08.2016, allowed the appeal of the Respondent. The Petitioner filed this application against

the said judgment.

The contention of the Petitioner is that-

a. The date reserved by the learned High Court Judges to deliver the judgment (i.e.

25.05.2016) was inadvertently taken down as 25.10.2016 by both th e counsel and the

power of attorney holder of the Petitioner;

b. On 25.05.2016, the judgment was re-fixed for 30.08.2016;

c. Th e judgment was finally pronounced on 30.08.2016 and the Petitioner was absent and

unrepresented;

d. On 25.10.2016, the counsel and the power of attorney holder ofthe Petitioner discovered

about the judgment delivered on 30.08.2016;

e. The Petitioner could not make an application to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal

a~ the appealable time period was already lapsed.

The remedy by way of restitutio in integrum is an extraordinary remedy and is given only under

very exceptional circumstances and the power of the court should be most cautiously and

sparingly exercised [Perera et al v. Wijewickreme (15 N.L.R. 411), Menchinahamy v. Muniweera

et al (52 N.L.R. 409), Sri Lanka Insurance Corparatian Ltd v. Shanmugam and Another (1995) 1

Sri.L.R. 55].

The Petitioner contends that the absence on the part of him on the date of judgment (i.e.

30.08.2016) was due to the mistake made by the instructing Attorney-at-Law, the counsel and

the power of attorney holder of the Petitioner [paragraphs 15 and 23 of the written submissions

dated 20.06.2018]. In support of his case the Petitioner has annexed marked 'F' an affidavit of

the counsel who appeared for him in the High Court of Civil Appe llate of the Western Province

holden in Colombo.

The Respondent points out that even though an affidavit affirmed by the counsel was annexed to

the petition, no evidence was produced before this court to show that the instructing Attorney-

at-Law and the power of attorney holder have also "mistakenly" taken down the date of judgment

as 25.10.2016.

In the case of linadasa and Another v. Sam Silva and Others [(1994) 1 SrLL.R. 232], Amerasinghe,

J. held-

"Since the petitioners had duly appointed a registered attorney they were obliged to act

through their registered attorney and not personally and, in general they were bound by

the acts and omissions of their registered attorney. As far as the registered attorney in this

case was concerned, the binding effect of his actions was based on the powers conferred

by the terms of a standard, printed proxy in terms of Form 7 of the First Schedule to the

Civil Procedure Code. It was neither extended expressly or impliedly, as it might have been,

nor was it restricted.

If the parties are required by law or by the court to be present, then they must be present.

In the case before court they did not have to be present once the registered attorney had

been duly appointed. In the circumstances, the petitioners were under no obligation to

explain their absence. It was the default of the attorney that had to be considered. If the

attorney, without suffiCient excuse, was absent on the date appointed for hearing, the

court, if it dismissed the application, is entitled to refuse to reinstate the matter. Where no

suffiCient couse is shown for the absence of the attorney who was under a duty to appear,

there are no grounds for an application ex debtor justitia of any inherent power to

reinstate the matter."

It was further held that-

"If counsel retained and instructed by the registered attarney fails ta appear an the

appainted date, it is for counsel, and nat the registered attorney ta explain his absence in

seeking reinstatement. Once the registered attorney has dane his duty of appointing

counsel i.e. retaining and instructing him, counsel assumes full control of the cose, and

becomes the 'conductor and regulator' of the whole thing. If, as in the cose before Court,

the registered attorney had not retained and instructed another attorney as counsel, then

it was the duty of the registered attorney to keep a track of the dates fixed, for then it was

he, and he alone who was entitled in terms of the law, and obliged in terms of the proxy,

to appear and conduct the cose."

In view of the above, I hold that the affidavit affirmed by the counsel is sufficient evidence to

show that a mistake was made in taking down the date of the judgment.

But the question to be considered is whether such mistakes warrant the exercise of the

revisionary and/or restitutionary jurisdiction of th is court.

Ru le 16 of the Supreme Court (Conduct of and Etiquette for Attorneys-at-Law) Rules 1988 reads

as follows -

"Where the services of an Attorney-at-Law have been retained in any proceedings in any

court, tribunal or other institution established for the administration of justice, it shall be

the duty of such Attorney-at-Law to appear at such proceeding, unless prevented by

circumstances beyond his control." [Emphasis added]

In the case of Samarasekera v. Indrani [(2007) 1 SrLL.R. 241 at 247] Chandra Ekanayake, J.

observed as follows -

"A mistake with regard to taking down of the wrang date (for delivery of the judgment) by

a party and his Attorney-at-Law cannot be considered as a ground that falls within the

purview of couses not within his control."

In Attorney Generol v. Herath and Another [(2003) 2 Sri.L.R. 162] it was held that whilst a mistake

could be excused, the negligence of a counsel is not a reasonable ground to set aside proceedings.

This position is was also adverted to in Jinadasa and Another v. Sam Silva and Others (Supra),

where Amerasinghe, J. observed as follows-

"As much the petitioners would enjoy the fruits of the success of their attorney's

endeavours, they must take the consequences of his defaults and failures."

Page 5 of 6

In view of the above, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to discharge the burden of

demonstrating to this court that non-appearance on the date of judgment was as a result of

circumstances beyond his control.

It is not the function of the Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction in restitution to relieve the

parties of the consequences of their own folly, negligence or laches [Don Lewis v. Dissonoyoke

(70 N.L.R. 8)]. The remedy of restitutio in integrum is not available to a party that has been guilty

of a blatant lack of due diligence [Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugam and Another

(1995) 1 Sri.L.R. 55]. Revision is a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the defendant is a

matter which is intensely relevant [Perera v. People's Bank (1995) 2 Sri.L.R. 84] .

In view of the above, I hold that that the Petitioner has failed to establish any grounds which

entitles him to relief by way of revision and/or restitutio in integrum.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of

this court by way of revision and/or restitutio in integrum.

This application is dismissed without costs.
