01. This is an appeal against the order made by the learned High Court Judge of Malara on 09.10.2013, which affirmed the order of confiscation of a vehicle by the learned Magistrate of Malara on 31.05.2012.

02. The accused H.K. Kamal Ranjilh and Sudalh Nandana Weeralhunga were charged

in the Magistrate's Court of Malara for transporting timber using the lorry bearing registration No. WPLD 5911 without a valid permit, contravening provisions of the Forest Ordinance. Upon pleading guilty to the charge both accused were sentenced on 24.05.2012. After inquiry that was held under Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance, the learned Magistrate made an order confiscating the vehicle, rejecting the claim by the appellant who is the registered owner. The appellant made an application to revise the said order of confiscation by the learned Magistrate, to the High Court of Malara. By his order dated 09.10.2013, the learned High Court Judge refused the application affirming the order of confiscation by the learned Magistrate.

03. Learned President's Counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned Magistrate has imposed a higher burden on the appellant at the inquiry. It was further submitted that the learned Magistrate has not taken into consideration the value of the timber that was transported and the evidence given by the appellant. The learned High Court Judge had misdirected himself when he said that the appellant had failed to produce the receipt from the service station, when in fact the vehicle could not go to the service station as it was detected before that.

04. Learned State Counsel for the respondent submitted the appellant has refrained from calling the person named Lakshman who is said to be his trustworthy person to give evidence to show that he took all precautions to prevent the vehicle being used for

3

any illegal activIty. The appellant had failed to take precautions on the day in question as he had not sent Lakshman with the driver as he did on other days. Hence, it is submitted that the appellant had failed to discharge his burden.

05. Section 40 (1) of the Forest Ordinance provides that;

"( 1) when any person is convicted of a forest offence-

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in respect

of which such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in committing such

offence, shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such

offence, be confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is a third

party, no Order of confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the

satisfaction of the court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use

of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, as the case may

be, for the commission of the offence. "

06. Hence, it is clear that the appellant (owner) has to prove to the satisfaction of the

court, that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence, in this case transporting timber without a valid permit.

07. In her order dated 31.05.2012, the learned Magistrate has said that the registered

owner testified that the vehicle was used to bring furniture from Moratuwa once in

two to three months (page 44 of the brief/ page 8 of the order), when in fact the

evidence of the registered owner was that the vehicle was sent to Moratuwa four

times a month (page 35 of the brief). With that mistake, the learned Magistrate has

further come to a conclusion that the registered owner could not have paid the

monthly leasing rental of the vehicle with that income. I am of the view that it was

4

an unreasonable and unjust assumption made by the learned Magistrate, when in

fact the evidence of the registered owner was unchallenged although he was cross

examined.

08. The evidence of the appellant was that he sent his relative confidant by the name of

Lakshman, whenever he sent the driver to Moratuwa to bring furniture. He had

checked with the Moratuwa furniture shop as well as his Dikwella shop to see

whether the vehicle had come. Although the petitioner had said in evidence that he

checked about the driver and the vehicle whenever the vehicle was sent to

Moratuwa, he never said in his evidence that he checked on the day in question

about the driver or the vehicle, when in fact he sent the driver alone without

Lakshman.

09. In the case of Mary Matilda Silva V. P.H. de Silva, Inspector of Police, Habar{/lla

/eA (PHC) 86/97, decided Oil 08.07.2010/, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew

discussed about the owner taking all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle

for the commission of the offence. His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew said;

"In my view, Jor the owner oj the vehicle to discharge the burden (1) that he/she

had taken all precautions to prevent the use oJthe vehicleJor the commission oJthe

offence (2) that the vehicle had been usedJor the commission oJthe offence without

his/her knowledge, mere giving instructions is not sufficient. In order to discharge

the burden embodied in the proviso to section 3A oj the Animals Act is it suffiCient

Jor the owner to say that instructions not to use the vehicle Jor illegal purpose had

been given 10 the driver? If the courts oj this country is going to say that it is

sufficient, then all what the owner in a case oj this nature has to say is that he gave

said instructions. Even Jor the second offence, this is all that he has to say. Then

there is no end to the commission oj the offence and to the use oj the vehicle Jor the

commission oj the offence. Every time when the vehicle is detected with cattle all

what he has to say is that he had given instructions to the driver. Then the purpose

oj the legislature in enacting the proviso to section 3A oj the Animals Act is

5

jruslrated .. .in the instanl case the owner did not call her driver and establish that

she had given instructions 10 him. "

Although it was a case under the Animals Act, the same principle applies to this

case.

10. One cannot expect the owner of the vehicle to be seated next to the driver every

time the vehicle is used by the driver. However, in this case, according to him, the

appellant has always sent Lakshman with the driver whenever the vehicle was sent

to Moratuwa to bring furniture. He has not taken that kind of precaution on the day

in question. The appellant had taken Lakshman with him when he went to see the

doctor. There is no evidence as to whether he had even called the driver or the shop

to check on the driver. It would take a considerable time to go to the place where

the timber was and to load seven logs of teak timber to the lorry. The evidence of

the Appellant was that the distance to the service station where the driver was

supposed to take the vehicle for service was about 500 meters. If the petitioner was

vigilant or he took precautions, it would have been impossible for the driver to

transport such timber as the service station was just 500 meters away.

II. The appellant has failed to call Laksman as a witness. Apart from the appellant,

Lakshman would have been the best person to testify about the precautions the

appellant had taken. The burden is on the appellant to satisfy Court that he took all

necessary precautions to prevent the commission of the offence. I am of the

considered view that the learned High Court Judge was correct when he found that

the appellant had failed to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that he took

necessary precautions to prevent the commission of the offence on the day in

question and that the order of the learned Magistrate should be affirmed.

6

12. Hence, the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 09.10.2013 dismissing the

revision application preferred against the order of the learned Magistrate dated

31.05.2012 is affirmed.

Appeal is dismissed.
