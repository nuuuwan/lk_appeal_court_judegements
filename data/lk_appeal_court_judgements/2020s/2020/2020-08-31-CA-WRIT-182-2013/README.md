Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The issue that has culminated in this application commenced in 1961, with the

Petitioners mother, Anula Kumarihamy being issued Permit No. 21 under the

Land Development Ordinance (the Ordinance). In terms of the said permit, a copy

of which has been annexed to the petition marked P1, the land given to Anula

Kumarihamy consisted of a high land, which is Lot No. 12 of the Kachcheri

Surveyors sketch in extent of 4A 1R and 10P, and a paddy land, which is Lot No. 20

of the said sketch, in extent of 1A 0R 8P.

The Petitioner, who claims that he is the nominated successor of Anula

Kumarihamy states that at about the same time that P1 was issued, the State

had also issued to G.G.Premaratne, Permit No. 20 in terms of the Ordinance.

There is no dispute that the 1st 4th Respondents are the successors of

Premaratne. According to the said permit, a copy of which has been annexed to

the petition marked P2, Premaratne has been given a high land and a paddy

land, described as being Lot No. 13 in Kachcheri Surveyors sketch and containing

in extent of 4A 2R 35P. The specific extents of the high land and the paddy land

given to Premaratne have not been specified in P2. However, it is clear from the

letter sent by the 7th Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Thamankaduwa in

November 2011 annexed to the petition marked P10 that the paddy land forms

part of Lot No. 297 in Supplement No. 2 of the Final Colony Plan No. 17 annexed

to the petition marked P4.

The Petitioner states that in 1986, the State had issued Anula Kumarihamy Grant

No. 10746, annexed to the petition marked P3, in terms of Section 19(4) of the

Ordinance, read together with Section 19(6) of the Ordinance. The First Schedule

4

to P3 identifies the land as Lot No. 308 of the said Final Colony Plan No. 17

marked P4, in extent of 2A 3R 20P. According to the Petitioner, the land given

under the Grant P3 was only part of the high land given to Anula Kumarihamy

under the Permit P1. Thus, when issuing the Grant P3, the State had not given

the entirety of the land held by Anula Kumarihamy under the permit P1 but had

instead given 1A 1R 30P less than the extent of the high land given under the

Permit P1. Be that as it may, the Petitioner claims that he is in occupation of the

entire land given under the permit P1 to Anula Kumarihamy.

I must observe at this stage that no reasons have been adduced by the 5th 7th

Respondents in their Statement of Objections for the reduction of the extent of

land when executing the grant P3. However, as would be adverted to later, it

appears that the reduction in the extent took place when preparing Supplement

No. 2 of the Final Colony Plan marked P4 and that the said reduction was due to

an oversight or inadvertence on the part of the 5th 7th Respondents.

The Petitioner states further that soon after issuing Anula Kumarihamy with the

grant P3, the State had issued Grant No. 10751 to Premaratne in respect of Lot

No. 305 of the said Plan P4. According to the said Grant, a copy of which has

been produced by the 1st 4th Respondents marked 1R2, the extent of Lot No.

305 is 3A 2R 10P. The Petitioner claims that Lot No. 305 includes the 1A 1R 30P of

the aforementioned high land that Anula Kumarihamy possessed under the

permit P1 and which extent of land the Petitioner states he continues to possess

until this date.

The Petitioner states that Anula Kumarihamy had complained to the 7th

Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Thamankaduwa about the alleged

5

discrepancy. Although the date of the complaint is not borne out by the

pleadings, it appears that such complaint has been made in 2011 and that an

inquiry had been held in April 2011. This is borne out by the letter dated 8th

September 2011 written by the 7th Respondent to the Petitioner and the 1st 4th

Respondents, annexed to the petition marked P6, which reads as follows:

The Petitioner had also complained to the Parliamentary Commissioner for

Administration (Ombudsman) in the latter part of 2011 about the purported

discrepancy. The report submitted by the 7th Respondent to the Ombudsman,

which has been annexed to the petition marked P10, sets out very clearly the

manner in which the discrepancy in the extent of land given to the Petitioner has

arisen. The relevant parts of P10 are re-produced below:

The 5th Respondent, the Commissioner General of Lands has sent the 7th

Respondent the following letter dated 29th November 2012 annexed to the

petition marked P11, which reads as follows:

f,i;a ldreKslj okajd isgsus.

It is therefore clear that the reduction in the extent of land given to Anula

Kumarihamy by the State is due to an inadvertence, and that the 5th and 7th

Respondents were of the view that the said discrepancy must be resolved. Thus,

even though the 1st 4th Respondents were requested to surrender the grant

marked 1R2 issued to them to rectify the said error, the 1st 4th Respondents

have not agreed to the said course of action.

It is in the above circumstances that the Petitioner has filed this application

seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing the 7th Respondent, the Divisional

Secretary of Thamankaduwa to take action in terms of P11 read together with

P10.

Before proceeding to consider whether the Petitioner is entitled to the above

relief, I would like to make reference to the fact that the 1st 4th Respondents had

filed Case No. 14036/L/10 in October 2010 against the Petitioner in the District

Court of Polonnaruwa in October 2010, seeking inter alia the following relief:

The Petitioner has produced with his written submissions, a copy of the judgment

of the learned District Judge where he has analysed the facts relating to the two

permits and the two grants, before holding that the 1st 4th Respondents are not

entitled to the relief prayed for. The judgment of the learned District Judge has

been upheld by the Provincial High Court of the North Central Province holden at

Anuradhapura, exercising Civil Appellate jurisdiction. I have not considered the

evidence led before the learned District Judge for the reason that an appeal has

been preferred to the Supreme Court against the judgment of the Provincial High

Court.

The first issue that this Court needs to consider is whether the 5th 7th

Respondents were under a legal duty to execute a grant in respect of the entire

extent of land that had been given by way of the Permit P1 to Anula

Kumarihamy, and whether Anula Kumarihamy had a legal right to receive the

entire land referred to in P1 by way of a grant. It is only if the first issue is

answered in the affirmative that this Court would have to consider whether the

relief prayed for by the Petitioner could be granted.

2 A copy of the plaint has been annexed to the petition marked P12. The second schedule to the plaint refers to a land in extent of 1A 0R 8P with the following boundaries North by the remaining portion of the same land; East by Lot No. 306 ; South by Lot No. 308; and West by the remaining portion of the same land and Lot No. 309.

9

Alienation of State land to any person under the provisions of the Land

Development Ordinance shall be effected in the manner provided in the said

Ordinance.3 Section 19(2) of the Ordinance specifies that every such person shall

in the first instance receive a permit authorizing him to occupy the land.

Section 19(4) of the Ordinance proceeds to state as follows:

A permit holder shall be issued a grant in respect of the land of which he is

in occupation:

(a) where he has paid all sums which he is required to pay under sub-

section (2);

b) where he has complied with all the other conditions specified in the

Schedule to the permit; and

c) where he has been in occupation of, and fully developed, to the

satisfaction of the Government Agent

(i) irrigated land, for a period of three years, or (ii) high land, for a period of one year:

A plain reading of Sections 19(2) and 19(4) would demonstrate that the following

conditions must be satisfied prior to being issued with a grant in respect of a State

land under the Land Development Ordinance:

1) A permit must be issued in the first instance in respect of the said land;

3 Section 19(1) of the Ordinance.

10

2) The permit holder must be in occupation of the said land;

3) The permit holder must develop the said land, to the satisfaction of the

Divisional Secretary;

4) The permit holder must comply with all other conditions specified in the

permit.

It is evident that in terms of Section 19(4), a grant is issued to a person who

already has a permit in respect of the land for which the grant is to be given. It is

thus clear that the issuing of a grant is a continuation of the permit issued in the

first instance.

It would be appropriate at this stage to refer to the judgment of the Supreme

Court in Agosinno vs Divisional Secretary, Thamankaduwa4. In that case, the

issue that arose was whether a nomination made under a permit would continue

to be valid after a grant was issued in respect of the same land, even though a

nomination had not been made under the grant. The Supreme Court, having

considered the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance, held as follows:

On an examination of the scheme of the sections, in particular, Section 19(4)

referred to in P7 itself, it is clear that the permit holders right fructifies to a

grant upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.

It is clear from the provisions of the law that the change in the nature of the

holding from that of a permit to a grant is one process and it should not be

taken as two distinct processes for the purpose of annulling a nomination

that has been previously made. 4 SC Appeal No. 30/2004; SC Minutes of 23rd March 2005.

11

Although the Supreme Court arrived at the above conclusion when called upon to

decide on the validity of a nomination made while the permit was valid, and the

permit had subsequently been converted to a grant, I am of the view that the

principle laid down by the Supreme Court that the transfer from a permit to a

grant is one process, would apply to this case.

The 1st 4th Respondents have not disputed the fact that the extent of the land

given to them under the permit was only 4A 2R 35P and, as pointed out in P10

that together with the paddy land, they have now received or are entitled to

receive by way of grant, an extent of 7A 1R 13P.5 Furthermore, the 1st 4th

Respondents have not explained to this Court their entitlement to an increased

extent of land. I must reiterate that the 1st 4th Respondents could only have an

expectation to receive the same extent of land given to Premaratne under the

permit, provided Premaratne and/or the 1st 4th Respondents have complied with

the conditions set out in Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance, and

nothing more.

The very fact that action was filed in the District Court by the 1st 4th Respondents

seeking to evict the Petitioner from an extent of 1A 0R 8P of land6 demonstrates

that the 1st 4th Respondents are not in occupation of the said land. Without such

occupation, the 1st 4th Respondents could not have developed the said land.

Thus, it is clear that Premaratne and the 1st 4th Respondents are not entitled in

5 The total extent of the paddy land depicted as Lot No. 297 in P4 is 4A 3R 11P vide P10. The total extent of paddy land that Anula Kumarihamy has received by way of the Permit P1 is 1A 0R 8P, leaving the 1st 4th Respondents with the rest of Lot No. 297 being a paddy land in extent of 3A 3R 3P. This, together with the extent of the high land given to G.G.Premaratne by 1R2, which is 3A 2R 10P means that the combined extent of the paddy land and high land of the 1st 4th Respondents is 7A 1R 13P. 6 Vide Second Schedule to the Plaint marked P12.

12

terms of the law to receive a grant over and above the extent of the land

specified in the permit marked P2.

The 5th 7th Respondents have not taken up the position that the Petitioner was

not entitled to receive a grant in terms of Section 19(4) in respect of the entirety

of the land covered by the permit P1. The 5th 7th Respondents have not alleged

that the Petitioner or Anula Kumarihamy did not develop the land or that they did

not occupy the land. Nor have the said Respondents alleged that Anula

Kumarihamy had breached the terms and conditions of the permit P1. As

observed earlier, the explanation given by the 5th and 7th Respondents points to a

mistake on the part of the said Respondents, which mistake the said Respondents

were keen to rectify hence, the request to surrender the grants so that the

extents of land specified therein could be rectified.

Taking into consideration the above, I am of the view that Anula Kumarihamy had

a legal right to receive a grant for the entire extent of high land held under the

permit P1 and that the State was under a legal duty to execute a grant in respect

of the entire extent of high land specified in the permit as the provisions of

Section 19(4) had been complied with. In the above circumstances, I am in

agreement with the position taken by the 7th Respondent in P10 and the position

of the 5th Respondent in P11 that the situation that has arisen must be rectified.

The next question that I must consider is whether the Petitioner is entitled to a

Writ of Mandamus directing the 5th 7th Respondents to take steps in terms of

P11.

13

In Ratnayake and Other v C D Perera and Others7 this Court identified the role of

Mandamus in the following manner:

The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public

authority to do its duty. The essence of mandamus is that it is a command

issued by the superior Court for the performance of a public legal duty.

Where officials have a public duty to perform and have refused to perform,

mandamus will lie to secure the performance of the public duty, in the

performance of which the applicant has sufficient legal interest.

The wide scope of the Writ of Mandamus was considered by this Court in Dr.

Jayalath Jayawardena v Chandra Fernando, Inspector General of Police8 where it

was held as follows:

Within the field of public law the scope of mandamus is still wide and the

court may use it freely to prevent breach of duty and injustice. Instead of

being astute to discover reasons for not applying this great constitutional

remedy for error and misgovernment, we think it our duty to be vigilant to

apply it in every case to which by any reasonable construction, it can be

made applicable. (R V Hanley Revising Barrister [1912] 3 KB 518).

As discussed above, I am of the view that Anula Kumarihamy, having developed

the land given to her in terms of the permit and being in occupation of the said

land, and in the absence of any allegation that she breached any of the terms or

conditions of the permit P1, was entitled to receive a grant in respect of the

7 1982 (2) Sri L R 456; followed in S M Gunerathne v Director General of Customs [CA (Writ) Application No. 894/07; CA Minutes of 23rd September 2009. 8 CA Writ Application No. 1507/2005; CA Minutes of 10th June 2008.

14

entirety of the land, at the time the State decided to issue the grant to her in

1986. In other words, once the State decides to give her a grant, she had a legal

right to receive the entirety of the land referred to in the permit and the

Respondents were under a legal duty to issue a grant in respect of the entire land.

This Court is therefore of the view that the Respondents have breached that duty

by recommending the issuing of a grant for a lesser extent of land than the permit

and that it would be in the interest of justice for a Writ of Mandamus be issued to

rectify the error.

Before concluding, there are two issues that I would like to address. The first issue

relates to an objection taken by the learned Counsel for the 1st 4th Respondents

that the Petitioner is not the sole nominee of Anula Kumarihamy. In support of

this objection, the 1st -4th Respondents have produced marked 1R1 a certified

copy of the folio containing the said nomination, which position has however

been contradicted by the 5th 7th Respondents who admit that the Petitioner is

the nominee of Anula Kumarihamy. It is noted that the Petitioner is not seeking

an order recognizing him as the successor of Anula Kumarihamy. Be that as it

may, it is observed that the 1st 4th Respondents have filed the District Court

action against the Petitioner, thus recognizing the Petitioner as the person in

occupation of the said land. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the

Petitioner has the locus standi to have and maintain this application.

The second issue raised by the learned Counsel for the 1st 4th Respondents is

that the Petitioner is guilty of inordinate delay, and thus not entitled to a

discretionary remedy. This Court observes that the complaints of the Petitioner

to the 5th Respondent and to the Ombudsman commenced only after the 1st 4th

Respondents instituted action in the District Court, and that this action has been

15

filed 7 months after P11 advising the parties to take legal action. To that extent,

the delay can be excused. In any event, a grave injustice would be caused to the

Petitioner in the event of this Court dismissing this application on account of

delay and for that reason, this Court is of the view that the discretion vested in

this Court should be applied in favour of the Petitioner. This view is supported by

the judgment of the Supreme Court in Biso Menika v.Cyril de Alwis and others9

where it was held as follows:

Unlike in English Law, in our Law there is no statutory time limit within

which a petition for the issue of a Writ must be filed. But a rule of practice

has grown which insists upon such, petition being made without undue delay.

When no time limit is specified for seeking such remedy, the Court has ample

power to condone delays, where denial of Writ to the petitioner is likely to

cause great injustice. The Court may therefore in its discretion entertain the

application in spite of the fact that a petitioner comes to Court late,

especially where the Order challenged is a nullity for absolute want of

jurisdiction in the authority making the order.

As held by the Supreme Court in Ranjanee Pathirana vs Secretary, Ministry of

Environment and Natural Resources and Others10, In the field of public law the

writ of mandamus is a powerful weapon the Courts use freely to prevent breach of

duty and injustice. I am of the view that this is one such case where the Writ of

Mandamus must be used to ensure compliance with the law.

For the reasons set out in this judgment, I issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the

5th 7th Respondents to recommend in terms of the Ordinance, the issuance of a 9 1982 (1) Sri LR 368 at 379-380. 10 SC Appeal No. 78/2006; SC Minutes of 5th March 2010.

16

grant in favour of the nominees of Anula Kumarihamy in respect of the high land

set out in P1, which land shall be equal in extent to the land set out in the permit

P1.

For the purpose of making the said recommendation, the 5th 7th Respondents

shall be entitled to:

(a) Conduct a fresh survey in order to identify the precise boundaries of the said

high land;

(b) Recommend the amendments that may be required to the extent of land set

out in 1R2 arising from the aforementioned recommendation.

I make no order with regard to costs.
