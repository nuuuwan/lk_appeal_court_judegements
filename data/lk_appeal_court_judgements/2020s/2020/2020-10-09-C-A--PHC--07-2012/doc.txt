Order ofdJe Primary Court Judge

C.A. (PHC)-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-20 II Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-52-20 I 0

161 After the filing of aflidavits and marked documents and written

submissions, the learned Primary Court] udge by order dated 08.06.20 II

held that the Appellant is entitled to tile possession of the land in question

until a competent court decides tile matter. The order of the learned

Primary COUItJudge is based on the follmving findings:

I. The Respondent has not explained by way of an allidavit as to why

the documents marked M7 to MI4 and M23 to M25 were filed and

on what basis the said documents are proving the possession of the

Respondent in the said property in the absence of any otller

documents in SUppOlt of his case;

2. The Respondent's aflidavit and the document~ are inconsistent with

each other with regard to the possession of tile property and the

Respondent has failed to adduce any evidence to establish his

possession to tile subject matter of the dispute as his documents do

not relate to tile possession of the land;

3. The Inquiry conducted by tile Bar Association of Sri Lanka has

established tllat the Attorney of the lawful owner Sri Sivaya had not

sold the property and the ownership of the propelty continued to

remain in the name of Sambandan Pathmanabha;

4. No one had been forcibly dispossessed of the property in dispute

before a period of 2 months immediately before the date on which

the information was filed on 20.05.2010;

5. The Appellant's documents m;u'ked 2EM 1-2E2 establish that the

Appellant took possession of the propelty in Janurary 2010 and

thus, he continued to hold the same under his control from January

2010 up to tile date on which tile dispute arose.

Application in Revision to the Provincial High Court

171 Being agl,J"rieved of the said order of the learned Primary CourtJ udge of

J affna, the Respondent made an application in revision to the Provincial

High Court holden in Jaffna seeking to have the said order daled

08.06.2011 revised and restoration of possession of the said property. Alter

lhe inquiry, the learned High Court Judge by his jud/:,'lllent dated

13.02.2012 allowed the revision application, set aside the order of the

learned Primary Court./udge and held that the Petitioner is entitled to tile

possession of tile property until an order is made by a competent Court.

Appeal to the Court of Appeal

181 Being aggrieved by the said judgment of tile learned High CourtJudge

of"./afTna dated 13.02.2012; the Appellant has preferred this Appeal to this

Court.

Main grounds of Appeal and Submissions of the Parties

I!JI At tile hearing, the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant Mr.

Manohara de Silva, P.c. confined his submissions to tile following grounds

of appeal and urged us to set aside the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge dated 13.02.2012 and allirm the order of the learned Primary Court

.J udge dated 08.06.2011:

I. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider tllat tile

Appellant has established that he had been in possession of tile I,Uld

in dispute from 06.01.20 I 0 to the date of the dispute as clearly

supported by tile allidavits of his brotller Kanagasabai Balasingham,

his neighbour Kandiah Rasaratnam (2-1Rl) and worker Ramiah

Thevarqja (2-1R2);

C.A. (PHC)-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-20 II Primary Coun Jaffna- PC-JalTna-52-20 I 0

2. The learned High Court Judge has only considered the omissions

contained in the affidavit of the Appellant and his brother, which are

omissions of a trivial nature, but disreg-arded the inconsistencies of

the affidavits of the Respondent and his documents;

3. The learned High CourtJudge has totally tailed to consider that the

Respondent has failed to establish that he was in possession of the

land in dispute fi-om 16.03.2010 to 04.07.2010 and that he had been

dispossessed by the Appellant as his documents do not support his

claimed possession and dispossession; and

4. The learned High Court Judge has totally tailed to consider that the

Respondent has admitted in his affidavit that the claimed

dispossession had taken place due to the action of the Police and

thus, the learned Primary Court Judge was correct in holding that

the Appellant is entitled to possession of the land in dispute in terms

of tile provisions of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act;

11 01 Mr. Silva submitted that accordingly, the learned High Court Judge

was wrong in setting aside tile findings of the learned Primary CourtJudge

and granting possession of the land in dispute to the Respondent without

evaluating the Respondent's documents with regard to the claimed

possession of the Respondent.

1111 On the other hand, tile learned Counsel for the Respondent Mr.

Sivendran, submitted that by Deed No.s 6995 and 6996 (MI and M2)

dated 16.03.20 I 0, tile property in dispute was purchased by the

Respondent and his son and his son's wife from Rasaiall Thavakumaran

and Malathy Thavakumaran who handed over the possession of the said

property on 16.03.2010 to the Respondent as corroborated by the aflidavit

C.A. (PHC)-0007-201 2 PHC Jaffua-1467-2011 Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffua-52-20 I 0

of their prevIOus owners, Rasaiah Thavakumaran and Malathy

Thavakumaran (M6).

1121 He tluther submitted that the Respondent was dispossessed on

06.04.2010 as corroborated by the allidavit of the previous owners of the

Respondent (M6) and thus, section 68 (:1) applies. He submitted that the

Respondent has established that he had been in possession of the property

in dispute Ii'om 16.0a.2010 to 06.04.2010 and that he had been

dispossessed on 06.04.20 I 0 and thus, the Respondent had been

dispossessed within a period of 2 months before t11e date on which t11e

information was tiled on 20.05.20 I 0

II al Mr. Sivendran further submitted that the position of the Appellant that

he entered into t11e possession of t11e land in dispute on 06.01.20 I 0 long

before he purchased t11e propel1y on 24.0:1.2010 by making ,m advance

payment of Rs. 100,000/- is untenable and which is not supported at all by

his own documentary evidence. His contention was that the Appellant's

case that he took possession of the property on 06.01.20 lOis not reliable

or trustwort11Y in view of the inconsistent positions taken by tJle Appellant

and his brother and absence of any allidavit or letter from his previous

owner conlirming that he authorized the Appellant or his brot11er to take

possession of the property before the transaction took place on

24.0a.20 1 O.

1141 Under such circumstances, Mr. Sivendran submitted t11at the learned

High Courtjudge was justilied in rejecting the version of the Appellant t11at

he took over the possession of the property on 06.01.20 I 0 and thereafter

he continued to hold t11e same when tJle dispute arose on 06.04.20 I O.

Scope of the Inquiry under Section 68 of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act

C.A. (PHCl-0007-20 12 PHC Jaffna-1467-20 II Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-52-2010

1151 A perusal of the infonnation filed by the Respondent dated

20.05.20 I 0 and the allidavits filed by the Respondents and the Appellant

reveals that the dispute between the Respondent and the Appellant relates

to the possession of the land under Palt VII of the Primary Courts'

Procedure Act (hereinafter referred to as the 'Ace).

1161 Sections 68 (I) of the Primal), Courts Procedure Act read as follows:

68 (I) W1Jere dJe dispute relates to dJe possessioll oFallY land or PaJt

dJereol,' it shall be the duty oFdJejudge oFdJe PninalY Court holdIng dIe InqUlIY to detennille as to who was liJ possession oFdJe laJJd or dJe PaJt on dIe date of dIe /ihllg of the liJ/ormation under section 66 aJJd make older as to who I~' enaded to possession of such laJld or PaJt thereof

1171 In an inquiry into a dispute as to the possession of any lalld under

section 68 (I), the main point of decision is as to who was in possession of

the land on the date of the filing of the information to the COUIt under

section 66 (1) of the Act.

1181 Sections 68 (3) of the Primary COUIts Procedure Act reads as follows:

"68(2) W1Jere at aJI liJqUl/y liJto a dispute relaaiJg to dJe right to dJe possession of aJly laJld or aJly PaJt oFa land the judge of the PrimalY

COUlt is satisfied dJat any person who had been In possession oFdIe laJJd or fJaJt has been /orcibly dispossessed wldJliJ a period of two months linmediately before dJe date Oil which dIe IIJ/onnaaon I-Fc1S filed ullder secaon 66, he may make a detelmliJaaon to dJat elk:ct and make ;w

1191 Section 68 (3) becomes applicable when only if the Judge Call come to

a definite finding that some other palty had been forcibly dispossessed

within a period of 2 months immediately before the date on which the

information was liled under section 66 of the Act (RaJnalliJ/jdJn v.

1liaJ7/jru'!iah (supra). Thus, it is the duty of the Primary Court Judge to

determine whether the Appellant had been forcibly dispossessed within a

period of 2 months immediately before the date on which the information

was tiled under section 66 of the Act, viz. 20.05.20 I O.

1201 The procedure of an inquiry under Part VII of the Act is sui gellen:s

and the procedure to be adopted and the manner in which the proceedings

are to be conducted are clearly set out in sections 66, 71 and 72 of the Act

Matters on Appeal

1211 In view of the extensive submissions made by both Counsel on the

correctness of the judgment of the learned High Court./ udge and the order

of the learned Primary Court.ludge, this Court is obliged to consider the

following main questions:

I. Whether the learned High Court.ludge was correct in setting aside the

findings of the learned Primary Court Judge on the ground tJlat the

Appellant's version that he entered into the possession of the land in

dispute on 06.01.20 I 0 before he purchased the property on 24.0:1.20 I 0

is not credible and inconsistent with the affidavit~ tiled in support of his

case;

C.A. (PHC)-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-20 II Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-52-2010

2. Whether the learned High CourtJudge was correct in setting aside dle

findings of the learned Primary COUItJudge and granting possession to

the Respondent if the Respondent's document~ do not support his

claimed claimed possession fiom 16.03.2010 to 06.04.2010 or

dispossession on 06.04.2010;

3. Whether the learned High CourtJudge has failed to consider that the

learned Primary COUItJudge has correcdy decided that the Respondent

has failed to establish his claimed dispossession within a period of 2

months immediately before the date on which the information was filed

under section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act;

Identity of ilie subject matter of ilie action

1221 It is common growld dlat Sambandan Padmananba and his wile

owned the property in dispute and the said Sambandan Padmananba had

appointed Sri Sivaya, Attorney-at-Law as his Attorney as set out in the

Special Power of Attorney o. 1005 dated 20_08_2005 (page 113 of the

brieO.

1231 In terms of the said Special Power of Attorney, dle said Sambanda

Padmanaba had appointed Sri Shivaya, Attorney-at-Law to manage, control

and sell dle land and premises marked 6B togedler widl the land marked

08.06.2005 at a consideration not less than Rs. 850,000/- per lacheham and

to receive dle consideration dlereof and to do all acts in relation dlereof.

1241 It is not in dispute that the subject matter of the dispute relates to a

bare land called "Kattupulam and SaLiyakandawatha" containing in extent

of 5 Lachcham Varah'1.l Culture and 11.6 Kullies depicted as lot I in Plan

No. 358 dated 26.10.1964.

The background to the Respective claims of possession

1251 According to Deed No. 5575 dated 12.10.2005 (M 15) <md attested by

Lin/,'<l Thurar<\ja, Notary Public, Rasaiah Thavakumaran and Malathy

Thavakumar<Ul til rough the Attorney of S<U11panthan Padmanabha, the

said Sri Sivaya, had purchased the said property. According to the two

Rubber Stamps placed by the Land Registry on the said Deed, the said

Deed had been registered in tile Land RegistlY on 13.12.2005.

1261 The Respondent has claimed tilat by Deed No. 6995 dated

16.03.2010 (M22) and 6996 dated 16.03.2010 (M21), the Respondent <Uld

his son Velautilapillai Rameshkumar with his wife purchased the said

property Ii"om tile said Rasaiah Thavakumar<m and Malathy

Thavakumar<Ul for a total sum of Rs. 22,00,000/-. According to tile two

Rubber St<Unps placed by the Land Registry of tile said Deeds, they had

been registered in the Land Registry on 15.04.2010.

1271 The Appellant has also claimed that he purchased tile property in

dispute Ii"om its owner S<U11band<m Padm<Ulabha by Deed of Transfer No.

692 dated 24.03.2010 attested by A. Gnanasekaram, N .P. at a

consideration sum of Rs. 3.5 Million and according to the Rubber Stamps

placed by the Land Re!,>istry on the said Deed, it had been registered in tile

Land Regisb"y on 30.03.20 I O.

Claims of possession of the Parties

1281 The Respondent has claimed that upon tile purchase of property in

dispute on Deeds No. 6995 dated 16.03.2010 (M22) <md 6996 dated

16.03.2010 (M21), by the Respondent, his son Velauthapillai

C.A. (PHCl-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-2011 Primary Co un Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-52-2010

Rameshkumar and his wife, the possession was handed over to them by

the said Rasaiah Thavakumaran and Malathy Thavakumaran on

16.03.2010 and they continued to possess the said land until he was

dispossessed by the Appellant through his workers on 06.04.2010 (M6).

1291 The Appellant's claim of possession on 06.01.2010 is, however, not

based on his Deed No. 692 dated 24.03.2010. His version is that he

entered into an agreement with the lawful owner of the property

Sambandan Padmanabha to purchase the said property and made an

advance on 06.01.2010 and at the request of the lawful owner, he took

possession of the said property on 06.01.2010.

1301 It is common ground that the dispute between the parties arose on

06.04.2010 and both parties had been called by the Police for in inquiry on

07.04.2010. It was the position of the Respondent that at the inquiry held

at the Police Staation on 07.04.2010, the Police warned both parties not to

enter the land ~\~thout a court order. It is to be noted that no party had

stated in their respective allidavits that they continued to possess the land

in dispute after the date of the inquiry held by the Police on 07.04.2010.

Findings of the learned High Court Judge on the question of possession of

the Appellant

1311 A pelUsai of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge reveals

that he had identified the follm~ng major contradictions and

inconsistencies in the atlidavits of dle Appellant and his brother Kathiresu

Balasingam with regard to the Appellnat's claim of possession of the

property on 06.01.2010 long before he purchased the property from

S,unbandan Padmanabha on 24.03.2010:

1. the person who made the advance payment to dle owner of the

property and as to when Ule money was paid;

C.A. (PHC)-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-2011 Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-S2-20 10

2. the nature of entry into the property;

3. the person who took possession of the property;

4. the date on which they took over the possession;

1:121 In setting aside the order of the learned Primary CourlJudge, the

learned High CourtJudge has analysed the atlidavits of the Appellant and

his brother and held that the Appellant's version that he made an advance

payment and took over possession of the property in dispute at the request

of its lawful owner on 06.01.2010 is not a genuine and trustworthy as there

are glaring contradictions and inconsistancies on material points of advance

payment and possession thal go to the root of the Appellant's claim of

possession on 06.01.2010.

13:11 The learned High Court./udge has observed that the learned Primary

Court Judge has htiled to consider the glaring contradictions and

inconsistances 111 the correct perspective with regard to the claimed

possession of dle Appellant and and his brother and thus, the allidavit~

liled by the Appellnat and his brother cannot be relied upon in establishing

the possession of the Appellnat on OG.O 1.20 1 O.

Analysis

1341 The Appellant in paragraphs 2 and 3 of his affidavit has stated that he

had an al,'Teement with Sampandlan Padm;maba who was living in Malaysia

to purchase the land in dispute and as per dle said agreement, he made an

advance payment on 06.01.2010 to Sampanthan Padmanabha. Paral,'raphs

2 and :-l of the AppellanL's allidavit are as follows:

"2. J do stale lhaL tilerc !Vas an agreemenL aJ7ived at beL ween

3. As per dJe s;ud agreement, an advance payment was made by me

and I went to the said land on 06thJanuary 2010 with my brother, the 01st respondent and took over the land '~

1351 The Appellant, however, does not mention in his affidavit any amount

of the advance payment made by him to Sampan than Padmanaba. On the

contrary, the Appellant's brother Kathiresu Ponniah Balasingham has

stated in his aflidavit that at the request of his brother, he made the

advance payment through one of his relatives called Darmalingam N agulan

and the advance payment made by him was Rs. 100,000. The relevant part

of paragraph 3 of his atlidavit reads as follows:

"3. But he has infonned to maKe adviwce payment iwd maKe certaJiJ dJat dJe land wIll be purchased. / made dJe ill1a.JJgemen(s to make advance payment through my relative, one Dannalingam Nagulau, who is illJ adlmiJlstrative ollieer at Colgate IiJ Malaysia. He on my request paid an amount of one lack (an equal amount in Sn' Lankan value), the payment was made on 06 ofJanuary 2010 ....

1361 It seems to me first, that there is a materiaf omission in the affidavit of

the Appellant with regard to the amount that is said to have been paid by

the appellant's brodler to Sampanthan Padmanaba and a major

inconsistency between the two aflidavits with regard to the person who

made the advance payment to Sampanthan Padmanaba.

1371 As noted, it was the position of the Appellant in paragraph 3 of his

afTidavit that after making an advance payment by him to Sambanthan

Padmanabha, he went to ilie said land on 06ili January 2010 wiili his

broilier and took over ilie possession of ilie land. T he position of his

brother in paragraph 3 and 4 of his affidavit is as follows:

3-"In the meiwarne, he had liJlolmed BalasliJghillna to taKe over dJe land on 06thJillwillY 2010 Itself When }\1/: BalasinglJiUn IiJformed me that dJe above silld pillticulill-s, I took over the land on 06th January 2010. Then I was inspired to enter into the land and I went

into the land. 1 saw dIe Uc:e.\~ shrubs, bushes ;U1d VJiJes and ciIinbJilg plants weJC: l1;illirally bJc:d O/J the land and / glanced at the well too.

77Ien / JiJionned ot dlJ:, 10 lJaiasnshnam and asked l1Jin 10 JiJionn about dJls to Padmanabha.

"4- On 10th ofjanuary, 2010, Balaksrishnan came from Colombo and on II"', 12'" and 13''', I with the said l3alakrishna got the land cleared through the helper and put up a hut for the watcher."

la81 The Apeplhmt's brother's version is that he alone took over

possession on 06.01.20 I 0 and the Appellant came to Jafli1a Ii'om Colombo

only on 10.01.2010 and visted the land on 10.01.2010 whereas the

Appellant's version is that he took over possession on 06.10.2010 and thus,

both had contradictied with each other on the person who took over

possession of the land on OG.O 1.20 1 0 and as to when the possession was

taken by the Appellant.

la91 Other than the statements 01' the Appellant and his brother contained

in their aJlidavit~, no material whatsoever, is available to substantiate the

claim of the Appellant or his brother that an advance payment was made to

S;U11panthan Padmanabha on 06.01.2010. According to the Appellant, he

purchased the property from its lawful owner of the property Sampanthan

Padmanabha. Ir Sampanthan Padmanabha had received an advance

payment and requested the Appellant or his brother to take over

possession of his property, the only person who could have said so was

S,unpanth;m Padm;mabha and none other.

1401 If the Appellant's version is correct, the Appellant could have easily

produced an aflidavit or a letter Ii'om Sampanthan Padmanabha to 111e

ellect that he received an adv,mce payment and aul1lOrized the Appellant

or his brother to take possession of his property. No affidavit or letter was

produced in the Primary Court by the Appellant li'om Samp,mth,m

Padmanabha to substantiate his position that he received an adv,mce

C.A. (PHC)-0007-20 12 PHC Jaffna-1467-2011 Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-52-2010

payment and authorized the appellant or his brother to take possession of

the property on 06.01.2010.

1411 The inconsistency and improbability of the version of the Appellant

and his brother that they made an advance payment of Rs. 100,000/- and

took possession on 06.01.2010 is further confirmed by the absence of any

advance payment in d1e Appellant's Deed of Transfer No. 692 dated

24.03.2010. It is to be noted that the Appellant's Deed No. 692 does not

state anywhere that a sum of Rs. 100,000/- was paid by the purchaser

previously as claimed by the Appellant.

1421 According to the attestation clause in Deed No. 692 dated 24.03.2010,

the Notary Public had certified and attested that the total consideration of

the sum of Rs. 3.5 Million had been paid in the following manner:

(I) Rupees Two Million (Rs. 2,000,000/-) by cheque bearing No.

006295 dated 22"" March 2010 drawn to Commercial Bank, Ward

Place Branch;

(2) Rupees One Million and Three Hundred (Rs. 1,300,000/-) by

cheque bearing No. 006298 dated 24"' of March 2010 drawn to

Commercial Bank, Ward Place Branch;

(3) Rupees Two Hundred Thousand (Rs. 200,000-) by cash.

1431 According to the attestation clause, the sum of Rs. 200,000/-

mentioned in the attestation clause had been paid on 24.03.2010 as there is

no reference to any previous advance payment in the Deed. If the

Appellant or his brother had paid a sum of Rs. 100,000/- to Sampan than

Padmanabha on 06.01.2010, it should have been mentioned in Deed No.

692 or at least, d1e Notary should have mentioned the advance payment

received by the seller on 06.01.2010 in the attestation clause.

C.A. (PHCl-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-2011 Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-S2-2010

1441 No explanation is given by the Appellant as to why the parties did not

mention in the Deed about the purported advance payment of Rs.

100,000/- made on 06.01.2010. In the absence of any such explanation,

the only conclusion that can be arrived at is that no such advance payment

of Rs. 100,000/- WdS made to Sanlpanthan Padmanabha by Ule Appellant

or his brother on 06.01.20 I O. The credibility of the version of Ule

Appellant and his brother Ulat a sum of Rs. 100,000/- was paid to

Sampanulan Padmanaban on 06.01.20 lOis not supported by their own

Deed No. 692 dated 24.03.20 I O.

1451 On Ule oUler hand, there is no indication whatsoever, in Deed No.

692 that the possession of Ule property was handed over to the buyer on

06.01.20 lOin terms of any previous agreement between the Appellant and

Sampanthan Padmanabha pending the completion of Ule transaction. If

Sampanthan Padmanabha had previously aUU10rized the Appellant to take

possession on 06.01.20 I 0 or the Appell<U1t had, in fact, taken possession of

Ule property on 06.01.20 I 0, the same should have been mentioned in

Deed No. 692 executed on 24.0:-3.2010.

1461 On the conb'ary, the Deed only states that the purchaser shall be

entitled to peaceful possession and enjoyment of the said land with elfect

from the date of the Deed and not on the basis of any previous al,'Teement

as claimed by Ule Appellant. Page 3 of Deed No. 692 at page 103 of the

brief reads as follows:

"AND we dle said Vendor lix l71inselFand his heli:5, executoJ:\" cUld admli71!itrators hereby covenant and widJ dJe said Purchaser his heirs executors administrators and assigns that the said Purchaser shaD and may at times hereafier peacefuUy quiedy possess and enjoy the said land and premises together with the right of ooy hereby sold alld conveyed cue: lie:e livm ally charge lien seizwe: sequestration acquilition or adler encumbrances or procee(iJiJgs whaLl"Oever and

1471 Section 72 of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act prescribes the

material on which the detennination under section 68 and 69 of the Act is

to be based. The detelmination under Part VII of the Act shall be made

after examination and consideration ol~

(a) The infOlmation filed and the allidavits and documents furnished;

(b) Such other evidence on any matter arising on the a1lidavits or

documents furnished as the court may pelmit to be led on that

matter; and

(c) Such oral or written submissions as may be permitted by the Judge

of the Primary Court in his discretion.

1481 The determination in both situations set out in section 68 (I) and 68

(3) on the question of possession and dispossession shall be made after the

examination and consideration of matters set out in section 72 of the Act..

When the infonnation is filed in the Primary COUIt under section 66(I)(b)

WiUlout the assistance of a Police RepOlt and observations, the Primary

COUItJudge should consider Ule aHidavits and documents and such other

evidence arising thereon, cautiously and ascertain for himself whether there

is consistency of the facts stated in allidavits and documents furnished wiUl

what is agreed and shown by Ule other evidence to have occurred.

1491 The discrepancies or omissions which do not go to the root of Ule

question of possession or dispossession and assail Ule basic version of Ule

allirmant cannot be given too much of importance. However, all material

inconsistencies, including contradictions or discrepancies that go to the

C.A. (PHC)00072012 PHC Jaffna14672011 Primary Court Jaffna PC-Jaffna52-20 10

root of the basic question of possession and dispossession and shake the

basic version of the allirmant atfect the trustworthiness of his statement in

the aflidavit.

1501 There are major inconsistencies in the atlidavits of the Appellant and

his brother with regard to the advance payment and possession of the

Appellanat on 06.01.2010. There is a total absence of any independent

confirmation Ii'om Sambanthan Padmanabha that he authorized the

Appellant to take possession on 06.01.2010. Those material

inconsistencies and discrepancies cannot be described as mere omissions

of a trivial nature due to defective memory or normal errors of observation

or mental disposition of the alfirmant or information shortage etc.

1511 The absence of any alfidavit or a letter from Sampanthan

Padmanabha whatsoever, confirming the advance payment and taking

possession on 06.01.2010 further creates a serious doubt about the

truthfulness or credithwortheness of the version of the Appellant and his

brother in their affidavit~ as correctly submitted by Mr. Sivendran in his

submissions.

1521 In my view, the material inconsistencies referred to above on the vital

question of the Appellnat's possession go to the root of the Appellnat's

claim of taking possession of the land in dispute on 06.01.2010 and shake

the basic version of his case that he paid an advance on 06.01.2010 and

took over possession of the land in dispute on 06.01.2010.

1531 The learned Primary Court,Judge merely relied on two allidavits tiled

by the Appellant's own claimed neighbour Kandiah Rasaratnam (2-1Rl)

and his own worker Ramiah Thevar<lja (2-1 R2) in SUppOit of the

Appellant's possession on 06.01.2010. The learned Primary Court,T ucige

has totally failed to consider that the intrinsic value of the affidavit~ of the

C.A. (PHC)-0007-20 12 PHC Jaffna-1467-2011 Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-S2-20 1 0

Appellant and his brother and decide how far, they can be relied upon in

the context of the Appellnats' own documents that do not support his own

basic version as to the payment of advance money and taking possession in

the absence of any authority granted by the lawful owner to take possession

on 06.01.2010.

1541 The learned Primary COUlt Judge has not considered as to why he

preferred to believe the affidavits of the Apepllnat's so called neighbour

and his own worker when the intrinscic value of the Appellnat's basic

version is not supported by his own immediate previous owner to dle etlect

dlat the Appellnat took over possession of the land in dispute on

06.01.2010 widl his sole authority. When the basic version of the

Appellant and his brother is shaken so as to create a doubt about it~

credibility, the intrinsic value of the two atlidavits tiled by Kandiah

Rasaratnam and Ramiah Thevaraja, which only sUPPOlted the appellant's

basic version is also vitiated.

1551 For those reasons, I hold that dle learned Magistrate was wrong in

holding that the Appellant has established that he took possession of the

land in dispute and continued to possess the said land until the date on

which the dispute arose on 06.04.2010.

The Respondent's claim of possession

1561 At dle hearing Mr. Silva submitted that the failure of the learned High

CourtJudge to evaluate the Respondent's documents which do not support

the Respondent's possession before granting possession to the Respondent

is lita! to his jud!,'TTlent, whereas the learned Primary COUIt Judge has

properly evaluated the documents and rejected dlem for valid reasons. He

referred to the following documents filed by the Respondent and

submitted that dle said documents are eidler irrelevant or do not support

C.A. (PHC)-0007-2012 PHC laffna-1467-20 II Primary Court laffna- PC-laffna-52-20 10

the Respondent's possession and hence, the learned Primary Courtjudge

having considered those document" rejected them for valid reasons.

1571 I have perused the documents marked M4, M7, M8, MIl, MIO,

Mll, M12-MI4, M12, M13, and MI41 and MIS -M22 and lind that a

majority of documents relate to receipt, for the payment of rates and taxes

made to the Nallur Pradeshiya Sabha by the Respondent's predecessor in

title, Rasiah Thavakumar (MalitllY) during tile period of 2005-2008. As

noted, in an inquiry under section 66 of tile Primary Court, Procedure

Act, the question of title or right to possession of tile parties to tile land are

irrelevant suqject however, to the exception.

1581 Even if the aforesaid documents are rejected on the ground that tlley

do not support tile possession of the Respondent or that may only relate to

tile Respondent,'s predecessor in title, the real issues in the present case

relate to the question of actual possession of tile parties and where

dispossession is alleged, whether tile party who had been in possession had

been dispossessed witllin a period of 2 months immediately before the

date of the information.

1591 Mr. Sivendran however, submitted til at the learned Primary Court

Judge has rejected tile Respondent's claimed possession and subsequent

dispossession witllout due regard to the intrinsic value of the most vital

atlidavit filed by tile Respondent's previous owners (M6) who confirmed

til at tile Respondent's possession from 16.03.2010 to tile date of the

dispute and subsequent dispossession.

1601 According to the Appellnat's Deed No. 692, the appellant, had

purchased the S,U11e property only on 24.03.2010 and the appellant's

possessIOn as at 06.01.20 I 0 was demonstTably unreliable and

untrustworthy in view of the material inconsistencies in the allidavits ,U1d

C.A. (PHC)-0007-20 12 PHC Jaffna-1467-20 II Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-52-20 I 0

the absence of any independent and supportive documents from his own

immediate previous owner.

1611 l 'he ReSI)Ondent's d d lInme late pre ecessors In title Rasaiah

Thavakumaran and Malathy Thavakumaran had given an affidavit marked

M6 (pages 57-58 of the original brief and the correct sworn translation of

the said affidavit had been filed by the Respondent witll the pennission of

tile COUlt by motion dated 04.08.2020 which is filed of the brief).

1621 According to the affidavit of Rasaiah Thavakumaran and Malathy

Thavakumaran (M6), they purchased the property on Deed No. 5575 on

12.10.2005, possessed the said property for the last 5 years from

12.10.2005 until they sold the property to the Respondent and his son on

16.03.2010. They have further stated that while the Respondent and his

son were in possession, the original Respondent Balasingham dispossessed

tile Respondent and his Son. The relevant parts of their affidavit read as

follows:

"We purchased dJe pIVpelty liJ PalJay Road as "Kattupulam and SaliyakandawadJa" situated in KokkUl'll EraI; Nallur Kovitpattu IiI jalliJa Division, in dJe Distnd ofjaffiJa, NOlthen PIVvince liJ extent of 5 LachaIns aIJd 11.6 Kulli togedJer wldJ a well se;u,:hed aIJd surveyed by TlJaIlg-dl~iaJJ, Licensed Surveyor by vlitue of a Deed of

and while they were in possession, BaJasingam of No. 56, Chet1y Street, Nallur acted in a manner for them to lose possession.

1631 The learned Primary CourtJudge in his order (page 58 of the brief)

refers to the said allidavit of Rasaiah Thavakumaran and Malathy

Thavakumaran (M6) and observes as follows:

"The document 111iU*ed M6 is an affidavit of" RaS;n~YI Thavakum;u<11l ;nld his' WIIi: }IJa1adlY. Vl/7Jere dJey have dec/;u-ed dJat dJey had purch;/sed dIe said land dIat is presendy liJ dispute on

1641 Having reproduced part of the contents of the aflidavit of Rasaiah

Thavakumaran and Malathy Thavakumaran (M6), the learned Primary

CourtJudge has disregarded the said allidavit for the mere reason that no

other documents were filed by the Respondent to substantiate his version

that Rasaiah Thavakumaran and Malathy Thavakumaran possessed the

said land from 12.10.2005 to I (i.03.2005. The findings of the learned

Primary CourtJ udge at pages (i5-fi(j of the brief are as lollows:

"The p;n1y of dJe fint just over all liJ general has st;/t-ed Iii dleli-affidavit dlat dley c/e;u-ed die lalld ;nJd dJe possession of" dlat I;wd

1(i51 The Respondent has further filed an affidavit marked M3 from

Krishanapillai Sinnarasu and his wife, Mathillini who had stated that from

II th month of 2005, they worked once in three months or (i months in

C.A. (PHC)-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-2011 Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-52-20 I 0

"S , Ir s land in Palaly Road, Kondavil and they together with "Sir" erected

fence around the land in 2005, cut branches of trees inside the land,

weeded Nayuruvi and burned them, removed the heap of stones using

tractor and put them in Sir's Murug-an Temple Road situated nearby. The

learned Primary Court Judge has rejected the affidavit of Krishanapillai

Sinnarasu and his wife, Mathillini (M3) on the ground that their affidavit

does not state to whom they worked as it refers to one "Sir of Palaly Street,

Kondavil" .

1661 Even if the said affidavit does not refer to whom they work as they had

only stated "Sir of Palaly Street, Kondavil" without referring to any person,

no cogent reason had been I,riven as to why the affidavit of the

Respondent's immediate previous owners Rasaial1 Thavakumaran and

Malathy Thavakumaran. In my view, no fixed number of affidavits or

documents are required for the determination of a credibility of a

statement contained in an affidavit filed in the Primary Court. It is based

on the maxim that "evidence is to be weighed and not counted"

(numbered)-" Testes pOllderantl1l~ 11011 llumerantl1l". The factors that

ought to be taken into account when evaluating the credibility of a

statement contained in an affidavit are the quality, weight, and value rather

than the number of affidavits.

1671 The said Rasaial1 Thavakumaran and Malathy Thavakumaran had

purchased and held the property for almost 5 years from 12.10.2005 to

16.03.2010 without any interference from Sambanthan Padmanabha. The

previous owners of the Respondent had clearly confirmed that they sold

the property to the Respondent and his son on 16.03.2010, a doctor,

family of Neervely and while they were in possession they were

dispossessed by Balasingam, the original Respondent who is the brother of

the Appellant. The basic version of the Respondent and his son, in my

C.A. (PHC)-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-2011 Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-S2-2010

view, is more consistent with the version of their previous owners on the

question of their possession and dispossession contained in their allidavit~

in the absence of any allidavit or letter whatsoever, given by Sambandan

Padmanabha confirming that the Appellant took over possession of the

premises on 06.01.2010 as discussed.

1681 The learned Primary Court./udge has not given any valid reason as to

why the intrinsic value of the Respondent's predecesors in title are vitiated

in favour of the two allidavits of K Rasaraulam (2-1 R I) and Ramiah

Thevara,ia (2-R2) who only supported the Appellnat's basic verson which is

not supported by the Appellnat's own documents and at least, his own

previous owner Sambandan Padmanabha.

1691 A perusal of tlle order of the learned Primary Court Judge further

reveals tllat having said that the determination of title is immaterial, he had

in fact taken into account tlle title to the Deed No. 5575 and decided that

the title to the Respondent's possession on the basis of his predecessor's

title tllrough Attorney Sri Sivaya is weak as revealed at the disciplinary

inquiry held by tlle Bar Association of Sri Lanka into tlle conduct of

Attorney Sri Sivaya. He has determined that as Sri Sivaya had admitted that

he did not alienate the said property in his fax sent to Sambanthan, the

Respondent's claim that he entered into the property in question on tlle

su'ength of Deeds Nos. 6696 and 6995 is also weak due to the findings of

the disciplinary inquiry. His findings at page 67 of tlle brief are as follows:

"77lOugh dIe party of'the lint states dlat they became entided to dIe land through the Power olAttol17ey of'.!>iii Sivaya, it could be noted limn dIe lilqUJiy held by dIe .!>/i Lanka Lawyer's Association (l17e notes wldl rqplTl to the liHIUJiyare seen li1 dIe document "2-1.R-8'J

commiltee of the Lawyers' Association, which is a governing body that goveI71S aU the AttoI71eys-al-Law, that is deh"vered ali:er investigation made on the document submilted by the party of the second. It is my opinion that the s;ud !act weakens the trend of the case of the party of the 01 st.

1701 A perusal of the copy of the extract of encumbrance of the property of

Sambandan Padmanabha at pages 162-109 of the brief with the attached

lax of Sambandan Padmanabha dated 10.02.210 reveals that what Sri

Sivaya had sent to Sambandan Padmanabha was an extract obtained by

him on 20.06.2005. The fax of Sam band an Padmanabha to one Bala on

10.02.2010 reads as lollows:

''Fonvallbi7g an extract oFNo encumbraJ7ces oFmy laJ7d issued by dIe Deputy Registrdr General of Lands Registry Jallna obtaJned by LawyerSn'Shivaya 011 hi5 applicatiol1 01120.0606 ... "

1711 The Respondent's predecessors in title, Rasaiah Thavakumaran and

Malathy Thavakumaran had purchased the property on 12.10.2005 and

thus, it is factually incorrect to take into account the extract~ issued by the

Land Registry on 20.06.2005 to discard the allfadavit of Rasaiah

Thavakumaran and MalatllY Thavakumaran and hold that the intrinsic

value of their affidavit is vitiated by the extracts of the Land Registry

submitted by Sri Sivaya to Sambandan Padmanabha.

C.A, (PHC)-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-20 II Primary Court Jaf'fua- PC-Jaf'fua-S2-2010

1721 The learned Primary Court Judge has furLher relied on the telexes

sent by the Attorney Sri Sivaya to Sam band an Padmanabha on 13.06.2006

(l-2-1R-7-2) to discard the intrinsic value of aflidavit filed by Rasaiah

Thavakumaran and Malathy Thavakumaran stating that Attorney Sri

Sivaya had told Sanlbandan Padmanaba in the said fax that he did not sell

the land. He has only relied on the last paragraph of the said fax in which

Sri Sivaya has stated "I wish to tell you that the land is still in your name"

(page 119 of the brief). In the same telex, at page 116 of the brief Siva

1731 It is clear that the said Sambandan Padmanabha had only made a

complaint to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka against his Attorney long

before the transactions in Deeds No. 6995 and 6695 dated 16.03.2010

took place (Vide- page 120 of the brief (2-R-4Rl). It seems that the

complaint of Sambandan Padmanabha was that his Attorney had

transferred dle property by Deed No. 5575 to a third party below the

minimum consideration and misappropriated ilie consideration. There is

no material whatsoever, that had been placed by the Appellant that the said

Sambandan Padmanabha had made any complaint against dle

Respondent's Predecessors in tile for a period of 5 years from 12.10.2005

to 24.03.20 I 0 or filed any action ag-ainst them or question their possession

on the basis of the transaction referred to in Deed No. 5575 is a forgery.

1741 In fact, Sambandan Padmanabha had never challenged the contents of

the aflidavits filed by Rasaiah Thavakumaran and Mafathy Thavakumaran

C.A. (PHC)-0007-20 12 PHC Jaffna-1467-20 II Primary Court Jaffna- PC-JaffnaS2-20 I 0

with reg-ard to their claimed possession from 12.10.2005 up to 16.03.2010

or the possession of the Respondent or his son from 16.03.2010 to

24.03.2010. He has only made a complaint to the Bar Association against

his Attorney for selling the property below the minimum consideration and

misappropriated the consideration referred to in dle Deed.

1751 The ownership of the property of the parties, including the validity of

dle Deed of Transfer No. 5575 or the execution of the said Deed \\~thout

prior registration or registration of the said Deed in wrong folios or selling

dle property below the minimum consideration or adequacy of

consideration are not the matters dlat shall be considered by aJudge of the

Primary Court in an inquiry under section 66 of dle Primary Courts'

Procedure Act.

1761 It is settled law dlat a Judge of a Primary Court is not expected to

decide any question of tide or right to possession of dle parties to the land

and evidence bearing tide can only be considered where dle evidence as to

possession is clearly balanced and the presumption of possession which

flows from tide may tile dle balance in favour of dle owner and help in

deciding the question of possession (Ramahilfjdl11 v 777aJ7g'dJdjah (supra). p.

698).

1771 Accordingly, it is wrong for the learned Primary Court Judge to take

into account the matters that transpired at the disciplinary inquiry of dle

Bar Association of Sri Lanka that had taken place long before the present

dispute arose between dle parties for the determination of possession or

dispossession in an application filed under section 66 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act. Those matters exclusively fall within the domain of

a competent civil court.

C.A. (PHC}-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-20 1 I Primary Court Jaffua- PC-Jaffua-S2-2010

1781 As noted, the consistency and reliability of the version of the

Respondent and his son are supported by the internal consistency of the

statement contained in their aHidavits and consistency of their version with

what their predecessors-in-title had said in their allidavit. In my view, the

intrinsic value of the atlidavit filed by the Respondent and his son could

not have been discarded and vitiated in the absence of any strong

indepednet material to the contr,u'y at least emanating from Sillnbandan

Padmanabha to the eHect that Rasaiah Thavakumill'an illld Malathy

Thavakumaran had never possessed the property for the last 5 years and

thus, the Respondent and his son could not have claimed possession to the

land in dispute.

1791 For those reasons, I hold that the Respondent has established that he

had possession of the property in dispute fi'om 16.03.20 I 0 until

06.04.20 I 0 as confirmed by the uncontradicted affidavit of their

predecessors in title, who had handed over possession to them on

](i.03.2010 on tile strenl,rth of their Title Deeds No. 6995 and 6996 dated

16.03.20 I O. Thus, I am of tile view til at the learned Mal,ristrate was wrong

in holding that tile Respondent has not established his possession of the

land in dispute from 16.03.20 I 0 until the date of the dispute.

Claim of dispossession made by the Respondent on 06.04.2010

1801 At the hearing, Mr. Silva furtller further submitted that the

Respondent had admitted in his atlidavit that he was dispossessed by the

Police action on 07.04.20 I 0 and tllUS, tile Respondent's claim of

dispossession fails.

1811 The Respondent's version was til at (i) when an advertisement was

published in Udayan Nespaper about the sale of the land in extent of 5

Parappu illld Kulli II with contact details (M24), he visited tile land on

C.A. (PHC)-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-20 II Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-52-20 I 0

06.04.2010 and observed that some peoples who were working there had

constmcted a fence on his land on all 4 directions and putting a padlock.

1821 The Respondent has further described in paragraphs 7, 8 and 10 of

his affidavit how he was dispossessed by the Appellant through his

employees:

7. Then when I contracted dJe person over dJe telephone, on one of

dJe numbers, given there, dIe s<lld person, the Respondent, gave his name and the address. He inlonned dJat he is gOliJg to sell his land and d7e deed is' kept Ii! Colombo;

8. On d7at day, I contacted my predecessors and my Attomey-at-Iaw and infOlmed d7em and went on WldJ the activities to take steps on d7e s<lld mattel;'

.9. On 06.04.2010, In dJe monniJg as usual when I went to my land, I

saw some five persons, the collies were cJeani7g d7e land. 77Jey were dn'VJiJg the sticks into dJe 0501/ on dJe boundaJY naJrawly between dJe stakes that I had planted lor IdentIfication oFdIe laJ7r1 In a day they put up the knce round the land on all four directions, for

demarcatIon and had constructed the shutters and had put the padlock. "

1831 It is crystal clear that the Respondent had made a specific claim of

dispossession that had taken place on 06.04.2010 and thus, there is no

merit in the argument that the Respondent was dispossessed by the Police

action on 07.01.2010. A pemsal of the alIidavits filed by the Appellant

and his brother reveals that they had not denied whatsoever, the specific

claim of the Respondent that he was dispossessed by the Appellant on

06.04.2010 through his workers by constructing a fence around dle land on

all 4 directions and putting the padlock.

1841 According to paI<l!,'Taph 10 of the Respondent's aJlidavit, he had made

a complaint to the Police on 06.04.2010 in respect of his dispossession and

the Police held an inquiry on 07.04.2010, warned the parties not to enter

C.A. (PHC}-0007-2012 PHC Jaffna-1467-2011 Primary Court Jaffna- PC-Jaffna-S2-20 I 0

the land till the order is obtained from Court and if they failed to maintain

peace, they will be taken into custody and remanded. Paragraph 10 of his

aflidavit reads as follows:

"lO-My son and 1, who i, engaged liJ respectable job made a compl;uiJt at d7e Police Station. And liJ dJe liJquiryon 07.04.2010, dJe Police wamed bodl parties not to enter die land all the order iI' obtali7ed fivm a COUlt havli7g filed d7e case and to maliltali7 peace. JI' anyone breaches, dJe peace, without cOl7S1deniJg dJe status, d7ey WIJ/ be taken li7to custody al7d rem;U7ded. "

1851 The Appellant's brother has stated in paragraph 7 of the aHidavit thaL

he was called by the Police for an inquiry as the Petitioner had lodged a

complaint against him and he went to the Police and made a statement and

later his brother also went to the Police. Paragraph 7 of the affidavit states

as follows:

"177en IiI the end of'Mal-ch, the Kopay Police asked me to come to dJe Police SILlaon lor Inqllliy as dJe peJ:l'on, VelauthaplJ/al' had lodged a complaliJt d7at he loa holds a share IiI dJat lalld. IliJionned dJe Police dJat 1 aln not d7e owner oldJe lal7d and HaskalasliJghaln is the owner of'd7e land and on d7e 1 Sd7 olApnl, BaskarasliJgham

went to dJe Pohc'e and met dJem and showed the deed dJat Ii was IiI hi, nalne. Hut, Velaud7afJlJ/ai who was dIe complalilaJJt did not show his deed."

1861 The Appellant or his brother had not denied paragraph I 0 of the

Petitioner's aflidavit or disputed the Petitioner's position that the Police

warned both parties not to enter the property and if one of the parties

breaches dle peace, they will be taken into custody and remanded.

1871 The Appellnat in para/,'Yaph 10 of his allidavit had merely reproduced

a part of the Respondent's claim of dispossession, but the Respondent's

specific claim of dispossession on 06.04.2010 had not been disputed in his

C.A, (PHC)000720 12 PHC J.ffn.-1467-2011 Prim.ry Court J.ffn.- PC-J.ffn.-52-20 1 0

aflidavit. The Respondent's affidavit is dated 20.05.2010 and the Appellant

filed his affidavit on 03.08.2010 while his brother filed his affidavit on

19.07.2010 and thus, the Appellant and his brother had sufficient time to

deny the claim of dispossession made by the Respondent

1881. The information has been filed by the Respondent on 20.05.2010

and the Respondent has satisfied that he had been dispossessed on

06.04.2010 and dlUS, section 68 (3) applies. When section 68 (I) applies,

dle Primary Court Judge must determine whether any person who had

been in possession of the land had been forcibly dispossessed widlin a

period of 2 months immediately before the date on which the information

was filed. The Appellant has purchased dle property only on 24.03.2010

and as noted, the Appellant has failed to establish that he had been in

possession of the property eidler on 20.03.2010 or before that date. On

dle other hand, dle Respondent has established that he had been in

possession from 16.03.2010 to 06.04.2010 and on 06.04.2010, he had

been dispossessed.

1891 For dlOse reasons, I hold that dle Respondent who had been in

possession of dle land in dispute from 16.03.2010 to 06.04.2010 had been

dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately before the date on

which the information was filed (viz. 20.05.2010) under section 66 of the

Primary Courts' Procedure Act. The learned Primary Courtjudge, in my

view has erred in holding that the Respondent has failed to establish his

possession of dle land in dispute Irom 06.03.2010 to 06.04.2010 and that

he had not been dispossessed widlin a period of 2 mondls from dle date

on which the information was filed on 20.05.2010.

Conclusion

1901 For the reasons enumerated in this judgment, I hold that the

conclusion reached by the learned High CourtJudge in his judgment dated

13.02.2012 that the Appellant has !ililed to establish his possession to the

land in dispute and that the Respondent is entitled to tile possession of tile

1,U1d in dispute until an order is made by a competent court is correct.

1911 For tile reasons enumerated in tllis judgment, I hold that the learned

High COUltjuclge is correct in allowing tile revision application filed by the

Respondent in the High Court ofjafl"na and setting aside the order of the

learned Primary Coultjudge oUaffna dated 08.06.2011.

1921 For those reasons, the appeal filed by the Appellant is dismissed. The

parties shall bear tlleir own costs.
