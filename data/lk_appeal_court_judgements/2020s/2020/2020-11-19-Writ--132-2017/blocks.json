However, either due to an oversight or otherwise, the Respondents have claimed that they are unaware of the averments in paragraphs 3-6 of the amended petition, which are the paragraphs that have set out the fact that the Petitioners have suffered permanent disabilities. Although the Petitioners have not submitted, either with their petition or counter affidavit, any document issued by the Police Department confirming that they are permanently disabled, the fact that a Government Medical Board have certified their disability, as well as their inability to work as a result of such disability, is sufficient proof that the Petitioners have complied with the first requirement of P4. The second requirement that must be satisfied to qualify under P4 is that the permanent disability must be as a result of injuries suffered whilst performing operational duties, or as a result of terrorist activity, or other law enforcement measures. As I have already observed, the Petitioners have stated that the 6th 10th Petitioners have sustained injuries whilst performing operational duties or due to terrorist attacks, while the rest of the Petitioners suffered their injuries during the line of duty. However, in view of the position taken up by the Respondents that they are unaware of the averments in paragraph 5 of the amended petition,6 the Petitioners should have responded by annexing the necessary material with their counter affidavit, which the Petitioners unfortunately have not done. Therefore, in the absence of any material to justify the position of the Petitioners with regard to the cause of their disability, I regret that I am unable to arrive at any conclusion with regard to the cause of the disability suffered by the Petitioners, or to determine whether the Petitioners are covered by P4.",
