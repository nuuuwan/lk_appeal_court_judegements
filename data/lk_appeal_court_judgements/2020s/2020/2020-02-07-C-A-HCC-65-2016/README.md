Justice K.K. Wickremasinghe

Accused-Appellant is present in Court produced by the Prison

Authorities.

Cou nsel for the Appellant informs Court that he is withdrawing

the appeal against the conviction. Therefore, the conviction is

affirmed. Further he makes submissions to bring down the

sentences to run concurrently and also to backdate the sentence

from the date of conviction and the sentence. Considering the fact

that he was in remand since 2016 and also he is 70 years of age and

further the offences in both counts were committed on the same

date, we order both sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently

and sentence is backdated from the date of conviction and sentence

namely, 04/ 05/2016.

Subject to the above variation, appeal is hereby dismissed.

Registrar is directed to send copies of this order to the learned

High Court Judge of Kurunegala and Prison Authorities.
