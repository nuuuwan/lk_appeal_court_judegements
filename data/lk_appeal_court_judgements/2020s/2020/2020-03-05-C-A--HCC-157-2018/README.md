Facts

161 The facts relevant to the charge on which the Accused-Appellant was

found !,'1Jilty are briefly summarized as follows:

171 On a tip ofl' received by the OtIicer in Charge of the Organized Crime

Division on 05.11.2018 about an attempt to steal fertilizer bags owned by

the Government, IP Rohana Mahesh and a team of Police Ollicers had

carried out a raid at Nuge Road in Peliyagoda. When IP. Rohana Mahesh

approached the Nuge Road in Peliyagoda, a parked Container Lorry

bearing Registered No. W.P.L.D.3895 was seen close to the 'Kekala'

shrubs with lights switched ofl' and the Driver (Accused-Appellant) and the

Assistant (2nd Accused) were engaged in unloading fertilizer bags. He had

seen unloaded 15 fertilizer bags close to the 'Kekala' shrubs and another

35 bags close to the Container Lorry. He had found the broken Metal

pieces of the Customs Seals, Iron Cutting Scissor, Iron hammer and a

knife which had been used to break open the Sealed Container on the

ground near the Container Lorry. vVhen documents were asked for, the

Accused-Appellant had given him bills produced by the Customs and (j

unused seals to the Police Ollicer.

181 He had taken charge of the broken pieces of metal seals marked PI

and P2, Iron Cutting Scissor marked P:1, 6 unused seals given by the

Accused-Appellant to him marked P5-PfO, the upper part of a Customs

Seal m,u-ked P II, 50 fertilizer bags mill-ked P4, balance 450 fertilizer bags

that were found inside the Container Lorry, the Container Lorry and the

CA-157/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (1-1(;,7125/2014)

t

knife. Out of 50 fertilizer bags, one such fertilizer bag had been marked by

the prosecution at the trial as P 12. Each lertilizer bag weighed 50 k/,'S and

carried the details including 'Mahinda Chinthanaya' in Sinhala and

'Government Subsidiary Fertilizer for Agricultural Development and

Agrarian Services Development'.

191 The Manager of the Warehouse Complex of Ceylon Fertilizer

Company, Mr. Punya Sri .layakody who visited the scene after the raid had

conlirmed that (i) 10- 15 lCrtilizer bags were seen on the N uge Road close

to the parked Container Lorry and similar number of fertilizer bags were

also seen on the road about 15 meters away Ii-om the said 10-15 fertilizer

bags; (ii) the Driver and the Assistant of the Container Lorry were present

at the scene; (iii) lertilizer bags in question were imported from abroad by

the Ceylon Fertilizers Company I(x al,'Ticultural purposes under the

'Mahinda Chinthanaya Subsidy Program'; (iv) the contract of

transportation of the said bags was entrusted to the A.M.T. Transport

Services to be u-ansported to the Wiu'ehouse in Hunupitiya; (v) they were

sealed by the Country that exported the fertilizer bags and the Driver had

no authority to open the Seals or stop the Container Lorry while being

transpOlted to the Warehouse and in case of any stoppage, the Company

must be kept informed; and (vi) the route of transportation was the

Peliyagoda and Negombo roads through Thotalawa and therefore, there

was no need for the Container Lorry to go to Kelaniya Road. He had

identilied the lertilizer bags imported by the Ceylon Fertilizers Company

marked P4,

1101 Piliduwa Paranahewage Vishw'!iith who was handling Fertilizers at the

Colombo Port had entrusted the impOlted lertilizer bags to A,M.T.

Transport Services to be transported to the Warehouse in Hunupitiya by

the Container Lorry in question. According to him, (i) when the fertilizer

CA-157/2018 HJGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC-7125/2014)

bags arrived at the Colombo Port, they were sealed by the Customs at the

Colombo Port after they were loaded into the Container Lorry; (ii) the

ti::rtilizer ba/,'5 in question were transported by Container Lorry bearing

Registered No. WP LD 3895; (iii) after he received all information from

Mr. Jayakody, at about 10.30 -I UlO p.m., he visited the Peliyagoda Police

Station and identified 50 fertilizer ba/,'5 kept in the Police Garage and other

fertilizer bags at the Police Station; (iv) a bag of lertilizer was valued at Rs.

7500/- and the entire value of 50 bags was Rs. 367 ,500/-. He had identified

the fertilizer bag marked P4.

1111 The Accused-Appellant, and the 2nd Accused made dock statements

denying the charges against them and called a TraJlic Police Oflicer who

stated that 011 0.'i.11.2008, he stopped a Lorry due to a defect in its head

lamps and issued the Temporary Driving License at Oliyamulla and not at

the Police Statioll.

The Law

1121 The olfence of Criminal Breach of Trust is delined in Section 388 of

the Penal Code as follows:

"WIioevel; belilg Ii} mallY manner en/Jllsted wldl plvperly, or WId}

;my dOl1l1iJa/Joll over plvperly, dishollesdy misapPlvpliale.5 or

COil verts to his OWIl use dlat properly or rli5hollesdy uses or dilposes

of'dlat pmperl)' IiI l1'o1a/Joll of';UlY (Iiirxu'oll of'law prescnbli}g dIe

such /Just; or wlllliJlly suffers any odIeI' persoll so to do, commits

'cnimi}ai hreacli or/Jusl ~

11 31 The essential ingredients to prove a charge under section 388 are:

CA1S7!201S HIGH COURT CRJM1NAL (HC712S!2014)

I. Entrustment with property or dominion over property; and

2. Either

(a) Dishonest misappropriation or conversion to his own use;

or

(b) Dishonest user or disposal, or

(c) Willfully suffering any other to do 2 (a) or (b).

1141 Criminal Breach of Trust may be committed by various persons and

tile Penal Code provides for dillerent degrees of punishment for Criminal

Breach of Trust depending on tile status of tile person who commits it. If it

is committed by a carrier, wharfinger or warehouse-keeper, it is an ollence

dealt with under Section 390 of the Penal Code as in the present case and

is punishable with a particular kind of sentence.

1151 In tile present case, the charge is an attempt to commit dle Criminal

Breach of Trust under section 390 read with section 490 of the Penal Code

and thus, if the Accused-Appellant is proved to have attempted to commit

the otlence of Criminal Breach of Trust, there would be no dilliculty in

linding dle Accused-Appell,U1t guilty of the ollence of attempting to

commit the Criminal Breach of Trust.

I HilThe learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence of the

prosecution in detail ,U1d come to the conclusion dlat the prosecution has

established beyond a reasonable doubt that (i) the Accused-Appellant

being the Driver of the Container Lorry was entrusted widl tile fertilizer

bags in question; and (ii) the Accused-Appellant had attempted to

dishonestiy misappropriate or convert to his own use or dispose of 50

fertilizer bags valued at Rs. 367,500/- and dlereby attempted to commit

Criminal Breach of Trust within the meaning of Section 390 of dle Penal

Code read with section 490 of the Penal Code. The learned High Court

CA-157/2018 I-DGH COURT CRlMINAL (J-IC7125/2014)

Judge has also rejected the dock statement of the Accused-Appellant, and

concluded that the dock statement of the Accused-Appellant did not create

any reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.

1171 At the hearing or this appeal, no submission was made by the learned

Counsel for the Accused-Appellant before this Court that the Fertilizer

bags in question were not entrusted to the Accused-Appellant by the

Ceylon Fertilizers Company to be transported to the Warehouse or the

Ceylon Fertilizers Company in Hunupitiya by the Container Lorry bearing

Registered No. WPLD 3H9!i.

Grounds of Appeal

IIHI When this matter was taken up for aq"rument on 17.12.2019, the

learned Counsel (Clr the Accused-Appellant submitted that the conviction

should be set aside on the IClllowing grounds:

CA-157!2018

I. The learned High CourtJudge had erred in law by failing to

consider that the evidence of dle main wibless, II'. Rohana

Mahesh is not credible enough to prove the charge beyond

reasonable doubt in view or the filct that dlere were a number

of contradictions per se and inter se in his evidence;

2. The learned High Court./udge had tailed to consider that the

prosecution litiled to adduce evidence or anodler wibless to

corroborate the evidence or the solitary witness, IP Rohana

Mahesh by calling SI. Sampath who accompanied IP. Rohana

Mahesh in the raid, which deprived the derence or the

opportunity to attack the veracity of the said solitary witness

and thereby denied a I~lir trial;

HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC-7125!2014)

3. The learned High Court Judge had failed to give due

consideration to the fact that the chain of productions had not

been proved hy the prosecution beyond reasonahle doubt;

4. The learned High Court Judge had f;liled to consider the

dock statement made by the Accused-Appellant in the proper

context which created a reasonable doubt on the prosecution

case.

Decision

Ground of Appeal-l

Failure to consider that the contradictions per se and contradictions inter

se in the evidence of IP Rohana Mahesh

1191 At the hearing, the learned Counsel for thc Accused-Appellant

submitted that the learned High Court./udge had failed to consider that the

evidence of IP Rohana Mahesh was not credible to prove Ule charge

beyond a reasonable doubt against Ule Accused-Appellant in view of Ule

number of material contradictions per se and contradictions inter se in his

evidence. The learned Counsel for Ule Accused-Appellant highlighted 5

contradictions per sc in the evidence of IP Rohana Mahesh and

contradictions Jilter se of his evidence with Ulat ofJayakody and Vishw<\jith.

1201 I shall now consider the 5 contradictions highlighted by the learned

Counsel for the Accused-Appellant during the hearing of ulis appeal:

(i) Contradiction with rcgard to the time of the receipt of the information

1211 IP Rohana Mahesh had stated in his evidence in chief Ulat the

inf()rm,ltion was first received over the telephone on 05.11.2008 at 14

hours about an attempted (helt of fertilizer bags in the Peliyagoda area.

CA-157/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC-7125/2014)

..

Under cross examination, he had stlted that the information was received

by S.I Sam path at about 21 hours.

ii. Contradiction WiUl reg-,ml to who received the information

1221 IP Rohana Mahesh had stIted in evidence 111 chief that the

information was lirst received by him from one of his and SI Sampath's

known intiJrmanL~ over the telephone, but under cross examination, he

had stIted that the information was tirst received by SI Sam paul.

Ill. Contradiction with regard to ule second inlormation

1281 IP Roh,ma Mahesh had stated in examination in chief ulat when ule

Police Party arrived at tlle Peliyagoda roundabout, they received another

information and under cross examination, he had stated that after they

entered Ule Nuge Road ill Peliyagoda, no information was received by

them.

IV. Contradiction WiUl regard to ule Police party waiting for one hour

until they received the second information with regard to the

location of the Lorry

1241 IP Rohana Mahesh had stIted in examination in chief that the raiding

party waited for I hour at a place closer to ule Peliyagoc\a roundabout until

uley until uley received tlle information about ule exact location of the

lorry (page (4). Under cross examination, he had stated that when tlley

entered tlle Nuge Road, uley saw the Lorry in question was parked near

the Nuge Road close to 'Kekala' shrub. (p. III).

v. Contradiction with regard to the number of unloaded fertilizer bags

1251 IP Rohana M;lhesh had stIted in evidence that 50 fertilizer bags had

been unloaded by the Driver and the AssistInt (page (7) whereas .Jayakody

CA-157/20IB mGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC-71 25/201 4)

had stated in evidence that 10-15 fertilizer bags were lying on the ground

(p. 141) and similar number of fertilizer bags were found some distance

away Ii'om the parked Lorry.

1261 The learned High Court Judge has correctly observed tllat there is a

cont:radiction with regan I to who first received the information and the

time of the receipt of the information either by IP Mahesh or SI Sam path

and the time of the information received by.Jayakody and Vishwiljitll who

arrived at the scene after tile raid. He had, however, taken tile view tllat the

discrepancy with regard to who received the information and tlle time of

the information were not material contradictions so as to allect the

testimonial trustworthiness of IP Rphana Mahesh.

1271 The learned High CourtJudge had flll-tller held that the discrepancies

in the evidence of Jayakody and Vishw<\jith with reg-.ird to the time of

information and arrival at the scene were not due to dishonesty or falsity of

their evidence but due to defective memory as the incident had taken place

7-8 years ago. His observations at pages 206, 222-223 of the Appeal Brief

are as fClBows:

1281 It is settled law that in evaluating the evidence of a witness and

assessing contradictions, it is necessary to examine the whole of his

evidence and ascertain whether the conl1'adiction is weighty or is trivial or it

shakes the basic version of the wi111ess and therefore, the Court is not

entitled to r~ject tile testimony of a witness unless tlley go to the root of the

case. The principle of the evaluation of tlle evidence of a v\~tness was more

cbu'ly laid down in tlle case of Best Footwear (Pvt) Ltd and two others vs.

Aboosally 1997 (2) Sri L.R 1:i8 in which F.N.D. JayasuriyaJ, at page 14G

observed as follows:

"In el'aiuauilg lhe el1dence of' a witness, a COUl1 or tnuunaJ J~' not

1291 Thus, the role of a judge in evaluating the evidence of a witness is to

direct his mind as to what contradictions matter and what do not and

whether they are material so as to allect the credibility of the witness. What

the Court has to see however, is whether theses variations are material and

alleel the case of the prosecution substantially as every variation may not be

enough to adversely aired the case of the prosecution. It is also important

to note that the Court should examine the evidence of a witness in its

entirety in order to arrive at a rational conclusion as his evidence cannot be

read in part and/or in isolation.

1301 The lirst and second contradictions only relate to (i) the time of

receipt of the inle:)Imation about an attempt to steal fertilizer bags and who

lirst received the information-whether by IP Mahesh or S.1. Sam path and

(ii) when Jayakody and Vishw<\iith received the inle:mnation about the raid

and the time of their arrival at the sccne.

CA-157/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL 0iC-7 I 2.5/2014)

1311 The learned High Court Judge has given his mind to the fact that

Accused-Appellant has admitted in his dock statement that the Police Party

had arrived at the scene and examined the Container Lony and thereafter,

Jayakody and Wharf Clerk Suranga arrived at the scene.

1:-321 It has transpired in evidence that the Traffic Police had stopped the

Lony in question at about 22.10 hours (10.10 p.m.) and issued the

Temporary Driving Licence to the Accused-Appellant at Periyamulle at

about 22.f 0 hours (10.10 p.m.). The Traflic Police Oflicer who was called

by the defence had clearly stated in evidence that he never asked the

Accused-Appellant to come to the Police Station or issued the Tempor;uy

Licence at the Peliyagoda Police Station.

Ja:~1 However, no material contradictions had been highlighted in the

evidence of I P Rohana Mahesh with regard to (i) arrival of the Police Party

and the time of the raid at 2:1 .hours and the time of the arrest at 23.:-30

hours; (ii) the unauthorized opening of the sealed Container at N uge Road

after having broken open the Customs Seals; (iii) the unloading of 50

fertilizer bags by the Accused-Appellant and the Assistant at Nuge Road;

(iv) the recovelY of broken metal pieces of Customs Seals, an Iron Cutting

Scissor and Hammer at the scene; (v) the recovery of New Seals similar to

the Customs Seals in the possession of the Accused-Appellant; (vi)

identification of the Accused-Appellant and the fertilizer bags.

1:-341 Accordingly, I am unable to see that the said minor variations as to the

timing of the receipt of the information and Ule timing of Ule arrival of

Jayakody and Vishwa,iith aL the scene can be regarded as giving any

advantage to Ule Accused-Appellant.

1:151 With regard Lo the third and fourth contradictions highlighted by the

learned Counselfc)r the Accused-Appellant, IP Roh;ma Mahesh had sLated

CA-IS7/20IB HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC7 I 25/2(14)

In evidence that when they arrived at the Peliyagoda Roundabout, they

waited for 1 hour until !lley receive further information about !lIe location

of the Lorry in question and when !lley received the correct information

about the location of the parked Lorry on Nuge Road, they arrived at Nuge

Road and observed !llat the parked Lorry in question close to the 'Kekala'

shrubs. Thus, the le;u-ned High Court./uclge was correct in holding that the

said contradictions are not material contradictions !llat go to the root of the

prosecution case.

1:-l61 With regard to the fifth contradiction highlighted by the learned

Counsel fur the Accused-Appellant, IP Rohana Mahesh had stated in

evidence that when he arrived at the Nuge Road, !lIe Driver and the

Assistant were engaged in unloading fertilizer bags and he had seen 50

fertilizer bags on the Nuge Road dose to the 'Kekala' shrub (p. (7). The

testimony of./ayakody was that he saw 10-15 fertilizer bags unloaded on the

road close to the Container Lorry and the same number of fertilizer bags

1371 Under such circumstances, the learned High CourtJudge was justilied

in holding that the conb-adictions lilter se were not shaking basic version of

IP Rohana Mahesh as the contradictions were not material contradictions

that would affect the testimonial trustworthiness of the witness.

1:-l81 Having regard to the entirety and the totality of the material placed

before the Court, the learned High Court./ udge had properly evaluated the

evidence of IP Rohana Mahesh and correctly held that his testimony is

cogent and credible whereas the contradictions are trivial in nature which

do not' go to the root of tile prosecution case.

1391 rl~he Court should also be mindful of the fact that after a considerable

lapse of time, as has happened in the present case, it is.customary to come

across contradictions in the testimony of witnesses. It is common tllat the

true characteristic feature of human testimony is full of infirmities and

weaknesses, especially when proceedings are held long after the evenl~

spoken to by the wib1esses and therefore, a Judge must expect such

contradictions to exist in tile testimony (Wickremasinghe vs. Dedoleena

and Others 1996 (2) SLR 9!i).

1401 As for the contradictions ill the e\~dence ofJayakody and Vishwajith

with reg-ard to the time of the receipt of the raid and time of arrival at the

scene, it is natural that contradictions in the human testimony with reg-ard

to tile exact time of receipt of information and arrival at the scene may exist

due to weakness of memory and power of observations when the incident

had taken place in 2008. The two witnesses had testilied in court 10 years

after the incident. However, the learned High CourtJudge had correctly

obselved Ulat their evidence with regard to the identification of tile

CA-l57/20l8 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC-7 I 2.5/20(4)

fertilizers in question, procedure of sealing at the Port by the Customs and

handing over the fertilizer bags to the M.A.T. Transport Services of which

the Accused-Appellant was the Driver of the Container Lorry bearing

Registered No. WP LD :3895 to be transported to the Warehouse in

Hunupitiya and the identification of unloaded 50 bags at the scene and the

Police Station had not been shaken under tlle cross examination.

1411 II nder such circumstances, I totally agree with tlle observations made

by the learned High Court Judge that contradictions in tlle evidence of

Jayakody and Vishv'Uith who had arrived at the scene after the raid had

occurred due to defective memory and not due to dishonestly or falsity of

tlleir evidence when their evidence was recorded long after tlle events

spoken to by the witnesses.

Ground of Appeal- 2

Failure of the prosecution to adduce evidence of another witness to

corroborate the evidence of the solitary prosecution witness

1421 At tlle hearing, tlle learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant argued

tllat tlle prosecution bileel to adduce the evidence of tlle Police Officer

who received the first int(mnation and the Trial Court had not considered

tlle failure of tlle prosecution to call at least one otller witness to establish

the raid and relied solely on tlle evidence of IP. Rohana Mahesh to

establish the charge against tlle Accused-Appellant, which deprived the

defence Ii-om testing the veracity of the evidence of the sole key witness, I P.

Rohana Mahesh.

14:31 The learned Counselor the Accused-Appellant aq,'1led that since tlle

conviction was based on the evidence of a solitary witness, IP. Rohana

Mahesh, the Trial .I udge should have exercised caution in evaluating tlle

CA-157/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC-7125/2014)

. "

evidence of the sole Police witness when the prosecution had failed to

adduce the evidence of other Police Oflicers who took part in the raid. His

submission was that in a raid carried out by Police Ollicers, in order to

bring about a conviction, the prosecution has to necessarily corroborate the

evidence of the main \\~tness by adducing the evidence of one member of

the raiding party.

1441 The E\~dence Ordinance lays down in section I a4 the specific rule

that no parL-icular number of witnesses shall in any case be required for the

proof of any fact. The rule, howeve,:, attaches more importance, to the

quality, than the quantity of evidence as the evidence to be weighted, not

counted (Haralal Dos v. Pasupati Charam A.I.R. (195,')) & Mulwa vs. State

of Madhya Pradesh A.I.R. (197(iQ SC 989, para 18).

1451 At Ule he<u-ing, the learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant heavily

relied on the decision of the Supreme Court in Ule case of R<\japaksha

Paulirage Justin R<\japaksha v. Prasanna Rathnayake and others SC/FR

689/2012 decided on 28.0B.20 Hi and submitted that in cases where more

police ollicers have participated in a raid and claim Ulat they lound

contraband in the possession of the suspect, it is not safe to act only on one

police ollicer's evidence.

1461 I shall now consider the lacts of the case relied on by the learned

Counsel l()r the Accused-Appellant and 'Ulen examine wheUler the

observations made by the honourable Supreme Court are applicable to the

facts of this case. R<\japaksha Pathirage Justin R<\japaksha v. Prasanna

Rathnayake and others (supra) was a fundamental rights cases filed by the

Petitioner who was arrested by a team of police ollicers on 25.05.2012

without giving any reasons and kept in the police cell till 27.05.2012 on

false charges <md thereafter Ule Petitioner was produced before Magistrate

CA-I 57/201 8 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC7 I 25/2Q1 4)

on 27.05.2012 on a charge that he was 111 possession of 6 packets of

cannabis, each containing !i /-,'Tams.

1471 The 1 st Respondent in his statement of ol~jections denied the ,UTesl of

the Petitioner and stated that the Petitioner was arrested only on

2G.0!i.20 12 by the 3rd, 4th 5th and 6th Respondents on an information

that he wa~ in possession of cannabis. The Gth Respondent on 27.05.2012

filed a B report stating that he arrested the Petitioner on 26.0!i.20 12 for

being in possession of cannabis and that the 3rd, 4th and !ith Respondents

participated in the raid in which the Petitioner was arrested. The 6th

Respondent's evidence before the Magistrate's court was however,

completely against the stand that he took in his B report filed in the

Ma/-,ristrate's Court. The lith Respondent has stated in evidence that (i) he

did not conduct a raid with the other police ollicers on 2G.0!i.20 12; (ii) he

neither arrested the Petitioner nor did he find any cannabis in the

possession of the Petitioner on the previous day (2!i.05.20 12); (iii) the 1 st

Respondent directed him to institute criminal proceedings in court against

the Petitioner for being in possession of cannabis ; (iv) he told the 1st

Respondent that he could not Ii Ie it B report in respect of the arrest which

he did not do but the 1 st Respondent threatened him to the effect that dle

1 st Respondent would take steps to cancel his appointment in the Police

Department if he did nol carry out the instructions /-,riven by the 1 st

Respondent; (v) in Icar of losing his job, he acceded to the instructions

given by the 1 st Respondent; (vi) the 1 st Respondent gave him 7 packets of

cannabis and directed him to state in the B report that one of the said 7

packets had been purchased liom the Petitioner and the balance (j packets

had been lound in the possession of the Petitioner and on the said

instructions of the I st Respondent, he prepared dle B report and prod uced

the Petitioner before the Magistrate on 27.05.2012. The Petitioner was

CA 1 57j20 18 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC-7 1 25/20 14)

alter considering the evidence of the lith Hespondent discharged the

Petitioner of the charge as it has been clearly established lilter alia, that the

Petitioner was not having cannabis in his possession and that a lilJse charge

had been hlbricated ag-ainst the Petitioner by the 1st Hespondent.

148111nder such circumstances, Her Ladyship Wanasundere J observed at

1491 It would appear therel()re, that the filcts of the said case ,u'e completely

dillerent from the lacts of the present case ,md thus, the instant case can be

distinguished from the above case. I am of the view that under such

circumstances, the observations made by the Supreme Court in the said

f'und;unental Rights case would not support the Accused-Appellant.

1501 While I agree that the evidence of a sole witness to the incident has to

be accepted with an amount of caution ;md circumspect, there is no

burden 011 the prosecution to provide an accused an opportunity to

challenge the veracity or credibility of a police witness in a detection by

calling other witnesses who took part in the raid provided however, that the

evidence tendered by a solitary witness is credible, reliable, in tunc with the

case of the prosecution and inspires implicit conlidence.

15 11 My view on this matter is further supported by the decision of the

Supreme Court in the case of Attorney-General vs. Devunclerage Nihal,

S.c. Appeal No. 154/ 10 decided on 12.05.2011. The Accused in this case

was indicted in the High Court under section 54(a) (c) of the Opium,

Poisons and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance I()!' being in unlawlill possession

of 9.91 !,'T;uns of heroin and after trial, the Accused was l(lUnd !,'Uilty or the

said otfence. The Accused appealed (twainst the said conviction and

sentence to the Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal set aside the

conviction and sentence and acquitted the Accused on the ground that only

CA151/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC-1125J2014)

one witness who took part 111 the raid where the Accused had gIVen

evidence.

1521 While setting asidc the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Suresh

Chandra./. observed at page 5 as follows:

"77Jerelhre, If il-clefu-dlat unlike in dIe case oFiUl accomplice or a

1531 It has been held in catena of decisions that there is no hurdle in

convicting a person on the sole testimony of a single witness in a

prosecution, if the.J udge is of the view that his evidence is clear and reliable

and a conviction can be based on such sole testimony as the principle is

that the evidence has to be weighted ,Uld not counted (Kusti Mallaiah vs.

State of A.P. 2013 Cri. L../. 309H). Thus, if the testimony of a sin/,'1llar

witness, after probing the testimony, is 1c)und by the Court to be entirely

reliable, there is no legal impediment in recording the conviction of the

accused on such proof (Vadivelu Thevar vs. The Slate of Madras, A.LIt

1957 SC (jI4).

CA-IS7/20IS HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HG7 1 25/201 4)

1541 In the case of Vadivelu Thevar vs. The State of Madras (supra), it has

been further held that Ille law of evidence does not require any particular

number of witnesses to be examined in proof of a /,riven fact. However,

faced with the testimony of a single witness, the court may classity the oral

testimony into Illree categories, namely, (i) wholly reliable; (ii) wholly

unreliable; and (iii) neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable. In Ille

first two categories, there may be no dilliculty in accepting or discarding the

testimony of the single witness. The dilliculty arises in the third category of

cases as the Court has to be circumspect and has to look for corroboration

in material particulars by reliable testimony.

1551 l lnlike in the case of an accomplice or a decoy, the testimony of a

police witness in a police detection cannot be r~iected merely because he is

police personnel and his testimony should be treated in the same manner

as testimony of any other witness. While I al,'Tee that the testimony of a sole

police witness has to be scanned with caution and circumspect, there is no

principle of law that without corroboration by independent witnesses, the

testimony of a police witness in a police detection cannot be relied on

when the Trial./ udge is satisfied that his evidence is entirely reliable.

1561 It is apt to refer to the following statement made by Anand./. in the

case of Tahir vs. State of Delhi (19%) 3 SCC :-\:1 at paragraph 6, dealing

with a similar question:

"/n our oplillon, no liJiinnity attac~les to dIe tes/Jinony oFdle police

cOlToboralion to tileli' eVIdence does not Iii aJlY "tay affix l the

creditwOldlliless of tile prosecu17on case. "

1571 The obvious result of t.he above discussion is that the evidence of a

sole police officer who carried out a raid can be relied upon and form the

basis of conviction when his evidence, with caution and after probing the

testimony is reliable and trustworthy as the Evidence Ordinance has laid

clown the emphasis on value, weight and quality of evidence which

determines the adequacy of evidence as had been provided under section

134 rather than on quantity, multiplicity or plurality of witnesses (Veer

Singh vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (2014) I SCC (Cri) 846). The Test thus is

whether the evidence has a ring of truth, is cogent, reliable, credible and

tTustworthy or otherwise, rather Ulan die quantity, multiplicity or plurality

of witnesses (Gulam Sarbarvs. State of Bihar (2014) 2 SCC (Cr) 195).

1.581 I am also of the view that an Accused can be convicted on the

evidence of a sole witness in a police raid in an appropriate case provided

however, that die Trial Judge is satisfied, after probing his testimony that

his evidence is reliable, credible, trustwordlY and beyond suspicion as the

emphasis is on the value, weight and quality of evidence which determines

the adequacy of evidence of a \vitness rather dian on quantity, multiplicity

or plurality of witnesses:

1.591 In the present case, the learned High Court Judge has properly

evaluated the testimonial trustwordliness of Ule prosecution witnesses and

CA-157/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC7125/2014)

.. laid emphasis on the value, weight and quality and reliability of IP Rohana

Mahesh in recording a conviction against the Accused-Appellant while

dischar/.,ring the 2nd Accused. He had fiuther relied on the circumstantial

evidence and the evidence ofJayakody and Vishw,\jith that connected the

Accused-Appellant to the attempted Criminal Breach of Trust in respect of

the fertilizer bags owned by the Ceylon Fertilizers Company as follows:

I. The evidence of I P Rohana Mahesh revealed that (a) the Container

LOrI}' in question was I,ound parked on Nuge Road close to the

'Kekala' shrub with lighl~ switched oll- and the Driver (Accused-

Appellant) and the Assistant (2nd Accused) were engaged ll1

unloading krtilizer bags near Ule 'Kekala' shruhs; (h) unloaded 15

krtilizer bags were found near the 'Kekala' shruhs and another 35

bags were found close to the Container; (c) the Customs Seals of the

doors of the Container Lorry had been broken open with an Iron

Cutting Scissor and Hammer and broken Metal pieces of the

Customs Seals were found on the road; (d) me New Seals similar to

Customs Seals were found in the possession of the Accused-

Appellant and the upper part of Ule Customs Seal was found near

the Container I A)rJ}' that connected the Accused-Appellant to the

ollence with which he was charged by the prosecution;

11. The evidence oUayakody who came to the scene had observed f 0-

15 fertilizer hags close to the LOrI}' and another similar number of

fertilizer bags little distance away Ii'OlTI the said bags, which

supported Ule testimony of IP Mahesh that about 50 bags had been

unloaded and kept on the road near 'Kekala' shrubs;

Ill. The LOrI}' was parked in an isolated place at Nuge Road having

switched ofr the lights and the Customs Seals had been broken open

with an Iron Cutting Scissor and Hammer which were found also

CA-157/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC7 I 25/20 14)

near the Lorry by [P Mahesh with broken metal pieces of Customs

Seals;

IV. The absence of any suggestion to [P Mahesh by the Accused-

Appellant while he was testifying with regard to the possession of

unused Customs seals in the possession of the Accused-Appellant;

v. Jayakody and Vishw<\iith had identified the fertilizer bags imported

by the Ceylon Fertilizers Company to be distributed under the

'Mahinda Chinthanaya Subsidy Fertilizer Distribution Pro/,'Tamme'

and they had identified 50 fertilizer bags that had been taken into

custody by the Police;

VI. The testimonial trustworthiness of [P Mahesh, Jayakody and

Vishw<\iith was not allected by the cross examination and no credible

reason was suggested on behalf of the Accused-Appellant that he was

f~llsely implicated by [P Mahesh or.Jayakody or Vishwajith;

vii. Although the reason given by the Accused-Appellant to park the

Lorry at Nuge Road at night was to go to the Police Station and

collect the Temporary Driving Licence, the said evidence was

contradicted by his own witness, P.C. 49014 and therefore, the

credibility of the evidence of the Accused-Appellant was clearly

shaken by the evidence adduced by the Accused-Appellant as to

render it unworthy of belief.

IGOI [t is to be noted tllat the Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the

timlin/,'S of bets, especially with regard to the credibility of witnesses unless

the lindings are highly unreasonable or perverse. This view is supported by

dle judgment of the Privy Council in Fraad vs. Brown & Company Ltd 20

NLR 282 wherein dIe Privy Council stated thus:

CA.157/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC7125/2014)

16 II In Alwis vs. Piyasena Fernando 199a (I) Sri LR 119 at 122, His

Lordship the Chief Justice G.P.S. de Silva observed that "it is well

established that the finding of primary facL~ by the trial judge who hears

and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal.". In

Gunewardene vs. Cabral and Others 1980 (2) SRLR 220, Rodrigo .J. held

that tlle Appellate Court will set aside inferences drawn by tlle trial judge

only if they amount to findings of fact based on:

(a) Inadmissible evidence; or

(b) After rejecting admissible and relevant evidence; or

(c) If the inferences are unsupported by evidence; or

(d) If the inferences or conclusions are not rationally possible or

perverse.

1621 Applying tlle principle laid down in the above judicial autllorities, I

refuse to interfere \\~th the findings of the learned High CourtJuclge who

has properly evaluated t11e testimony of II' Rohana Mahesh and applied

the test of probability, consistency pCI' sc and consistency liller .Ie and

weighted his evidence ill the context of the above-mentioned tesL~ and held

tllat his evidence is cogent, credible and trustworthy in relfdJ'd to the raid

carried out by him.

Ground of Appeal -3

Failure to give due consideration to the fact that the chain of productions

has not been proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt

IMI The leamed Counsel for the Accused-Appellant submitted at the

hearing that although IP Mahesh had detected unused Customs Seals in

the possession of the Accused-A ppellant, he had I;liled to seal them and

prove the chain of production.

1651 According to the testimony of I P Mahesh, all the productions

recovered by him at the scene, including the upper part of a sealing

insoument (P 11) and G unsealed new Customs Seals which were handed

over to him by the Accused-Appellant (P5-PP 10) were sealed by him at the

Police Station and handed over to the reserve under P. R.1158 (pages 100,

103-IOG). The learned Counsell()r the Accused-Appellant, however, drew

attention of Court to page 110 of the testimony of IP Mahesb where he

had stated that when the productions were shown to him in open Court,

the seals had been opened. The relevant part of his evidence at page 110 is

open Court and they were marked accordingly as P5 to PI 0 (page 95, 104-

105). Although he had stated that the Seals had been opened when he

identilied the productions in open Court, no further evidence had been

elicited Ii'om IP Mahesh as to whether the Seals or the parcel containing

the entire productions were opened 1'01' the purpose or identification or

productions in open Court or the Seals on the productions marked P5-P 1 0

had been removed by someone bel()re they were identilied by him in open

Court.

1671 On the other hand, the dock statement of the Accused-Appellant is

silent on the productions marked P5-P 1 0 as correctly observed by the

learned High Court Judge at page 2 1 8 or the judgment as follows:

16HI For those reasons, I am of the view that no reasonable doubt had been

created in the prosecution case with regard to the recovery or sealing of

productions marked P.'i-P I 0 or the chain of productions as clearly

observed by the learned High CounJudge in his judgment.

Ground of Appeal-4

Failure to consider the dock statement

1691 I shall now consider the 4th ground urged by the learned Counsel f()r

the Accused-Appellant that the learned High Court Judge has not

considered the lengthy dock statement made by tlle Accused-Appellant.

1701 The I()llowing principles are applicable in considering the dock

statement made by an Accused.

I. Ir the dock statement is believed, it must be acted upon;

2. If it raises a reasonable doubt about the case I()r the

prosecution, the defence must succeed;

a. Dock statement of one of the Accused should not be used

against another accused (Vide- The Queen v. Kul,uatne 71

NtH. 529).

1711 I shall now summarize the dock statement of the Accused-Appellant

as lollows:

1721 The Accused-Appellant denied the prosecution case from tlle dock

and said that:

a. he collected the Container at about 9.aO p.m. from the Colombo

Port and at gate 7, it was sealed by the Security Ollicers of Customs

in the presence of a Cust.om OlJicer and a Wharf Clark and

thereafter, a Custom Pass and a Seal were I,riven to him;

CA. 1 57/201 B HlGH COURT CIUMINAL (HC7125/2014)

-.

h. while he was driving the Container Lorry towards Hunupitiya

FerLilizer Stores, the Trallic Police stopped the Lorry at Oriyamulla

on the ground of maltimctioning of rear si/,'11allights;

c. as the Driving License was taken into custody by the Police, he was

asked by the Police Ot1icer to come to the Police StaLion to collect a

line payment form;

d. as there was other place to park the Lorry, he parked the Lorry at

N uge Road and went t<) the Peliyagoda Police Station; (v) after

collecting the line payment l(lI'ITI, he returned to the place where the

Lorry was parked and saw a Yellow Coloured Van parked next to

the Lorry with Police Ot1icers around it;

e. the Police Te,Ull wanted to open the Container but he refused and

gave the telephone number of the Wharf Clerk to the Police Team

who contacted the Wharf Clerk over the phone;

L thereatl:er, the Police Team obtained a Scissor li'Om a nearby

workshop and broke open all three seals of the Container;

g. when the seals were broken open, .')-0 fertilizer bags fell down from

the Cont;liner and he requested the Police team to give him a letter

stating that the Container was checked by the Police Team hut they

refused to issue such a letter;

h. at that stage, one Jayakody, Wharf Clark and one Surang-<l arrived at

the scene;

I. usually, two persons cannot unload the lertilizer bags fi'OITI the

container as the doors of the tank should be opened 2 hours before

unloading so that ammonia smell would go away by that time;

.I. if.')O bags were unloaded as claimed by the Police, about 2 '12 tons

from the whole weight will be reduced from the whole consignment;

k. the Police brought the Lorry and unloaded .')0 bags to the Police

Station and arrested him and the Assistant;

CA-157/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HG7125/20 14)

I. although he requested the Police to issuc him a document stating

that an inspection W,L~ carried out by the Police, the Police refuscd

to issue such a document;

m. the Police loaded the bags into the Container and took them with

the Lorry to the Police Station, unloaded 50 bags and arrested them;

(xiv) Jayakody is an Ollicer who was interdicted over fi-audulent acL~

and he was falsely framed to cover up fi-audulent activities of others.

17:11 The 2nd Accused had also made a dock statemcnt in similar terms.

The learned High Court Judge has rejected the dock statement of the

Accused-Appellant, ,U1d held at pages 217-220 of the brief that the dock

statement of the Accused-Appellant was not capable of creating a

reasonable doubt in the prosecution case liJr the following reasons:

a. The main defence of the Accused-Appellant was that (i) as his Driving

License was taken into custody by a Traffic Police Ollicer, he parked

the Container Lorry near Nuge Road and went to the Peliyagoda Police

Station to obtain a Temporary Driving Licence; (ii) when he returned to

Nuge Road, a Policc team had arrived and searched the Container

without his consent by breaking open Customs Scals by using an Iron

Scissor borrowed from a neill-by Workshop.

h. Although the Accused-Appellant called the Trallic Police Ollicer We.

49014), to establish this position, the Tratlic Police Ollicer conu-adicted

thc version of U1C Accused-Appellant, and the Assistant and testified to

the ellect that he issued a Temporary Licence marked V 1 only at

PelUYillTIulle at 22.10 hours but he never inlormcd the Accused-

Appellant to come to the Police Station or issued the Tempor;LfY

Licence at the Police Station;

CA-157/2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (I-IC7 1 25/201 4)

('. The Temporary Driving Licence marked V I established the evidence

of the delence witness P.c. 49014 that the Temporary Driving Licence

had been issued at 22.10 hours. The Accused-Appellant never clarified

the said evidence of his own witness in re-examination and therefore,

the Accused-Appellant's position that he parked the Lorry on Nuge

Road in order to go to the Peliyagoda Police Station t(Jr the purpose of

collecting a Temporary Driving Licence is improbable, inconsistent

and htlse with the evidence of his own witness;

d. Although tJle Accused-Appellant took up the position III his dock

statement that the Police Team brought an Iron Scissor /i'om a nearby

workshop and broke open the Customs Seals of the Container and

then, S-li bags fell down on the h'Tound, the above important position

t;lken up by the Accused-Appellant in his dock statement had not been

put to the prosecution wiuless, IP. Mahesh, which made the Court to

conclude that the said position of tJle Accused-Appellant in the dock

statement is an ali:erthought;

e. According to the evidence of I P. Rohana Mahesh, Ule Accused-

Appellant had given him unused New Custom Seals marked P5-PIO

but he Accused-Appellant had not challenged the recovery of the said

important piece of evidence from his possession or denied tJle

possession of New Customs Seals or hallding them over to IP. Rohana

Mahesh in his dock statement;

1741 The learned High CourtJudge has properly analysed and considered

the dock statement of the Accused-Appellant in detail, applied the above-

mentioned principles and given reasons lill' the r~iection of the dock

st.atement of Ule Accused-Appellant and the Assistant Having considered

all ule above-mentioned matters, I am of the view that the dock statement

CA157!2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC-7125!2014)

is not credible nor does it create any reasonable doubt in the prosecution

case and there/()re, the learned High Court./ udge has correctly rejected tile

dock statement or the Accused-Appellant.

1751 For those reasons, I hold that the Accused-Appellant had biled to

satisry this Court on any ground urged <,>n his behalr or that a miscarriage or

justice had occurred. In these circumstances, I see no reason to interrere

with the conviction or the Accused-Appellant. Accordingly, I uphold the

conviction or the Accused-Appella!lt.

Sentence

1761 The learned High CourL./udge has imposed a sentence of 3 years R.1.

and a line or Rs. 400,0001- and in debult I-year rigorous imprisonment.

The learned High Court Judge has imposed a sentence 01':1 years f()r the

I()llowing reasons:

I. The ollence has been committed in respect of fertilizer bags that

had been imported by the Ceylon Fertilizers Company to be

distributed to the poor hlrmers under tile Government Subsidy

Programme and the State had spent a large sum or money 1'01' the

said purpose. The attempt to commit the said onence by removing

lertilizer bags valued at Rs. :167,5001- entrusted to the Accused-

Appellant to be transported to the Warehouse or tile Ceylon

Fertilizers Company under such circumstances must be reg-arded as

an act or grave nature which deserves a custodial sentence;

ii. The Accused-Appellant being a carrier had illeg-ally parked the

Container Lorry with f'crtilizer bags in a place willi no light with the

intention of causing wronglul gain lor his benefit by removing the

Customs Seals placed by the Customs Ollicers at the Port of

CA-157/20IS HICH COURT CRIMINAL (HC,7125/2014)

Colombo ;Uld unloaded 50 fertilizer bags valued at Rs. :-367,500/- at

the time of the raid;

iii. The Aecused-Appell,Ult was found in his possession of new Customs

Seals simil;u' to the broken pieces o/" Customs Seals and there was

no reasonable explanation whaL~oever, as to how the Accused-

Appellant had in his possession New Customs Seals and other

similar seals;

iv. The Accused-Appellant had planned to re-seal the Container afler

removing fertilizer bags /"or his own benefit by using Seals similar to

the Customs Seals;

v. The ollence o/" this nature was a well-planned act and detection of

this types of well-planned ads are dillicult, but the detection was

made possible due to the timely acLion taken by the Police Team

that conducted the raid while he was directly eng-aged in unloading

fertilizer bags owned by the Ceylon Fertilizers Company;

vi. The Court must not only take into consideration the rights of the

criminal, but also the rights ,of the victim o/" the crime and the society

at large while considering the imposition of an appropriate

punishment.

1771 It is necessary /"or this Court to tirst look at the particular punishment

stipulated /"or the ollence that was committed by the Accused-Appellant.

The Accused-Appellant was in<iicLed f()r attempting to commit Criminal

Breach or Trust in respect o/" fertilizers owned by the Ceylon Fertilizers

Company valued at Rs. :~(i7 ,500/-, an ollence punishable under section 3~)0

of the Pen;ll Code read together with section 490 o/" the Penal Code.

CA157!2018 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC7125!2014)

.

17XI The punishment for the Criminal Breach of Trust under section :NO

of the Penal Code is an imprisonment of either description for a term

which may extend to 7 years and a fine, Section 490 of the Penal Code

stipulates the punishment lilr attempting to commit otlences punishahle

imprisonment as follows:

U\;Vhoever attempls to coml1nl all olli::lIcc pU/JI~17able by dn:, Code

with impnsDlllnelll, or to cause such all olfellce to be committed

IVldl such line as 1:1' plVl ided Ihr die ofli::JJce or IVldl bodl. "

1791 Section aoa (I) of Ule Criminal Procedure Code provides that the

following matters ,u-e to be considered before passing a sentence and the

way the sentence is to be suspended:

CA-157/2018

(a) The maximum penalty prescribed lor Ule oflence in respect

of which the sentence is imposed;

(1)) The nature and gravity of Ule ollence;

(c) The oll'cnder's culpability and degree of responsibility lor the

ollcnce' ,

(d) The oll'cnder's previous character;

(e) Any injury, loss or damage resulting directly from tile

commission of the ollence;

(I) The presence of any aggravating or mitig-dting factor

concerning the ollender;

(g) The need to punish Ule ollender to an extent in a m<umer,

which is just in all circumstances;

~UGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC7125/2014)

(h) The need to deter the olfender or other persons from

committing ollences of the same or of a similar character;

(i) The need to manifest the denunciation by the court of the

type of conduct in which the ollender was engaged in;

(j) The need to protect the victim or the community Ii-om the

olTender-,

(k) The I~lct that the person accused of the ollence pleaded j.,ruilty

to the ollence and such person is sincerely and truly

repent,Ult; or

(I) A combination of two or more of the above_

1801 Section 30:~ (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code refers to the

li)lltm~ng instances where a sentence of imprisonment cannot be

suspended:

(a) A mandatory mlllimum sentence of imprisonment has been

prescribed by law lill-the otJence in respect of which the sentence

is imposed; or

(b) The ollender is serving or is yet to serve, a term of imprisonment

that has not been suspended; or

(c) The ofJence was committed when the ollender was sul~ject to a

probation order or a conditional release or discharge; or

(d) The term of imprisonment imposed or the aggrqjdte terms of

imprisonment where the otTender is convicted lor more than one

o!lencc in the same proceedings, exceeds two years_

1811 Having considered the above-mentioned statutory provisions, I shall

now consider the authorities that show the manner in which mitig-dting and

aggravating I~lctors have been considered before a sentence is determined

by a Court.

CA-157/2018 HlGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC7 I 25/20 14)

,

" IH21 In this regard, I wish to place on record that it is the duty of the trial

court to impose a proper sentence having regard to the nature of the

offence and the manner in which it was committed by the offender. It is

settled law that (i) the imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner

in which the Court responds to the society's cry f'or justice against the

criminal; (ii) the Court must not only keep in view the rights of tlle

criminal, but also the rights of the victim of' the crime and the society at

large while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment

(Dhananjoy Chatteljee v. State of W.B. (1994) 2 SCC 220).

IHal In the case of' Attorney General v. H. N. de Silva f9.')6 (.')7 N.L.R.

121) Bassnayake A.CJ. observed that "In assessing the punishment that

should be passed on an offender, a Judge should consider the matter of'

sentence both lium the point of view of' the public and the offender. Judges

are too often prone to look at the question only Ii-om the angle of the

offender". Bassnayake A.C,J. further held that a Judge should, in

determining the proper sentence consider:

(i) the gravity of' the otfence as it appears from the nature of' the

act itself and should have regard to tlle punishment provided

in the Penal Code or other statute under which the ollender is

charged;

(ii) the ellect of' the punishment as a deterrent and consider to

what extent it will be etlective;

(iii) if'the of lender held a position of trust or belonged to a service

which enjoys the public contidence that must be taken into

account in assessing the punishment;

(iv) the dilliculty ill detection; and

(v) the public well~lre of' the State should outweigh the prevIous

good character, ,U1tecedents and age of' the oflender.

CA-157!2018 HIGH COURT CIUMINAL (HC-7 I 25/201 4)

IX41 In the case or Attorney-General v. Mendis (199!i) I Sri LR I:-3S, the

lC)llowing I~trtors were considered in sentencing:

I. the !,'Tavity or the olfence;

2. the punishment provided in the statute;

a.the punishment to be deterrent;

4.the effectiveness or the sentence;

.'i.the nature or the offence on which the otlender has been round guilty ot;

(i.the difliculty in detection;

7.the nature or the loss to the victim;

X.the pro lit accrued to the accused in the event of non-detection;

9.the point or view of the accused;

II.the mechanism and manipulation resorted by the accused;

12.the elfect or committing the crime;

I :-l.the persons who are atlected by the by the crime;

14.the ingenuity with which it has been committed;

I !i.the involvement or others in committing the crime.

IX51 In my view, the learned High CourtJudge was justilied in imposing a

custodial sentence having considered the matter or sentence both Iiom the

point or view or the public and the ollender, the nature of the oflence on

which the Accused-Appellant had been round guilty, the gravity of the

ollence, including tJ1e rollowing I~lctors in sentencing the Accused-

Appell,U1tl()r a term 01':1 years rigorous imprisonment:

CA157/2018 HlyH COURTCRlMlNAL (HC-7125/2014)

I. The Accused-Appellant being entrusted with 500 fertilizer bags to be

transported to the Warehouse of the Ceylon Fertilizers Company at

Hunupitiya had deviated the route, parked the Container Lorry

without light, removed the Customs Seals illegally and dishonestly

unloaded 50 fertilizer bags /i-om the Container to be used for his

own benelit in violation or tile direction or the Ceylon Fertilizers

Company prescribing the mode in which such trust to be discharged

to cause loss to the Ceylon Fertilizers Company;

ii. The Accused-Appellant was arrested by the Police Team while he

was directly engaged in unloading 50 teltilizer bal,'S in tile night

illegally by removing Customs Seals with an Iron Scissor and a knife

and if not ror Ule timely detection made by the Police Party, he

would have removed all unloaded fertilizer bags causing linancial

loss to the Ceylon Fertilizers Company and ultimately, to the

Government or Sri Lanka who spent a larger sum or money in

respect or the said Subsidy PrW,'T,unme;

111. Although all the unloaded rertilizer bags imported by tile Ceylon

Fertilizers Company were recovered by the Police, the Accused-

Appellant being a carrier or tertilizer bags had unloaded and

attempted to remove at least 50 lertilizer bal,'S valued at Rs. :~76,000/

illegally with tile intention of causing wrongful wain or tertilizer bags

to Ule Accused-Appellant and wrongrul loss to the said Company by

unlawlul meilllS or lertilizer bags, to which the Accused-Appellilllt

was not legally entitled;

IV. The prolit accrued to the Accused-Appellant in the event of non-

detection would have been more than Ih. :-l7(),000/- and the

linancial loss or damage resulting directly !i'om Ule commission or

the otknce to the Ceylon Fertilizers Company and/or ultimately to

CA-I 57/20 18 HIGH COURT CRIMINAL (HC7 1 25/20 14)

* the State in the event of non-detection would have been more than

Rs. a76,000/-;

v. The mechanism and manipulation resorted to by the Accused-

Appellant to commit the offence revealed that he had carefully

planned the entire operation at night/in hours of darkness by

f()rcihly breaking open the Sealed Container by using an Iron

Scissor and a knife and removing 50 fertilizer bags from the

Container. He had further planned to re-seal the Container after

unloading and removing the fertilizer bags filr his own benefit with

fraudulently made Seals with the words 'Sri Lanka Customs' which

he, heing only a driver of the Container Lorry was not legally

autllorized to keep in his possession;

VI. The persons who would also be ultimately affected by the ofience, in

the event of non-detection would have been poor farmers who relied

heavily at that time on subsidized fertilizer prOl,'Tamme introduced

by the State while the Accused-Appellant would have wrongfully

g-d.ined hy unlawful means of fertilizer bags to which he was not

legally entitled;.

18GI I am of the view that, having regard to tlle nature and gravity of the

ollence, mechanism and manipulation resorted to by the Accused-

Appellant, the ingenuity with which the oflence had heen committed, the

profit that would have been accIUed to the Accused-Appellant in tlle event

of non-detection and the wrongful loss to the Ceylon Fertilizers Company

and/or the State in the event of non-detection and the public perception

and interest of the society deserve a custodial sentence to be imposed on

the Accused-Appellant as correctly decided by the learned High Court

Judge.

f .. .

1871 Accordingly, I see 110 reason Lo inLerfere with the sentence imposed

on the Accused-AppellanL by Lhe learned High CourtJudge.

1881 For those reasons, I affirm the cOI1\~ c Li an and tJle sentence imposed
