Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This case is connected to CA/WRIT/284/2017 in which the

Judgment was delivered today.

The issue in both matters is identical, the only differences being

the names of the 5th Respondent employee, the date of the

complaint made by the employee to the Commissioner General

of Labour, the date of filing the Labour Tribunal application, and

the date of referral of the dispute for settlement by arbitration.

Both matters were argued together and all parties agreed to

abide by the decision delivered in CA/WRIT/284/2017.

Vide the Judgment delivered in CA/WRIT/284/2017 today.

Accordingly, the decision of the Minister to refer the matter for

arbitration is quashed by certiorari and the application of the

Petitioner is allowed with costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.

I agree.
