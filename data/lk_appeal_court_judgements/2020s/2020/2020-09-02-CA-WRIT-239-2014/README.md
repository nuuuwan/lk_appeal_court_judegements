Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 1st and 2nd Petitioners are two of three co-licensees of FL3

and FL4 liquor licenses. Their liquor shop at Lindula in the

Nuwara Eliya district was raided by a team headed by the 1st

Respondent on 10.06.2014 and inter alia adulterated liquor was

found in the shop. The shop was sealed on the following day,

11.06.2014. The 3rd Respondent, who was neither a licensee

nor present at the time of the raid but had a Power of Attorney

to look after the liquor shop on behalf of the 2nd Respondent,

met with the officers of the Hatton Excise office on the next day,

12.06.2014. He was asked to meet the 2nd Respondent, the

Deputy Commissioner of Excise (Revenue), in Colombo.

Immediately following the weekend (14th and 15th), the 3rd

Petitioner met the 2nd Respondent on 16.06.2014.

According to the Respondents, the 3rd Petitioner pleaded guilty

to the charges in P6, and thereafter, instead of suspension or

cancellation of the licenses in terms of section 27 of the Excise

Ordinance, the matter was compounded in terms of section 56

of the Excise Ordinance and a sum of Rs. 4,000,000 was ordered

to be paid vide P7.

The Petitioners filed this application seeking to quash P6 and P7

by certiorari and to compel the Respondents to refund the Rs.

2,000,000 already paid at the time of filing the application vide

P8.

However, R10 shows that during the pendency of the case a total

sum of Rs. 4,150,000 was paid by the Petitioners.

The Petitioners submit they are entitled to the reliefs sought on

three grounds.

The first is there was a violation of the audi alteram partem rule

on the part of the Respondents. It is a fundamental principle of

natural justice that before a decision is taken the decision-

maker shall hear both sides. The audi alteram partem rule

embodies this principle. Hearing both sides does not mean

hearing for the sake of hearing. The party to be penalised shall

be given a fair hearing.

Was a fair hearing given to the Petitioners in this case? The

Respondents in paragraph 12 of the statement of objections say

the 3rd Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge sheet marked

P6/R5(a). To begin with, P6 is not a charge sheet. It is a

standard show cause notice (Form No. Excise E41). According

to clause 2 of P6, a date shall be given to show cause in writing.

The Respondents also tender R5(b) to establish their claim that

the 3rd Petitioner pleaded guilty to the charges in P6. R5(b) does

not indicate a plea of guilt. It is in fact a request by the 3rd

Petitioner to make the payment ordered under section 56 of the

Excise Ordinance in installments.

The 3rd Petitioner does not accept that he pleaded guilty, as

alleged by the Respondents. He only admits he met with the 2nd

Respondent to seek the reopening of the business, which had

been sealed on 11.06.2014.

On the premise that the 3rd Petitioner pleaded guilty, the 2nd

Respondent ordered payment of a sum of Rs. 4,000,000, which

5

was admittedly done in terms of section 56 of the Excise

Ordinance.

In my view, the Petitioners were not given a fair hearing before

the decision contained in P7 was made, which is a violation of

the audi alteram partem rule. Decisions taken in breach of

natural justice are a nullity.

The Petitioners further state levying charges in a sum of Rs.

4,000,000 on the basis of compounding the offences is ultra

vires. Section 56 of the Excise Ordinance stipulates a monetary

cap to the discretion afforded to an officer in ordering the

amount to be paid thereunder. This means, in compounding an

offence, the officer cannot order any amount he thinks

appropriate in consideration of the severity of the offence. In

terms of this section, the officer can only order a sum of money,

not exceeding five hundred thousand rupees to be paid. In the

instant case, a sum of Rs. 4,000,000 was ordered, and in the

end, a sum of Rs. 4,150,000 was recovered from the Petitioners.

The Respondents say the Rs. 500,000 limit stipulated in section

56 is directory, not mandatory. I reject this argument. The

previous limit under this section was Rs. 1000; it has been

increased to Rs. 500,000 by Excise (Amendment) Act, No.37 of

1990.

It is also relevant to note that by the said Amendment Act,

section 58A was introduced, whereby the Excise Reward Fund

was established. This new section states all sums of money

received upon compounding charges under section 56 shall be

6

credited to the Excise Reward Fund, which is to be used for

payments to be made as awards to excise officers and informers.

The Respondents say there was acquiescence on the part of the

Petitioners because the 3rd Petitioner paid Rs. 2,000,000 on the

day following the issuance of P6 and P7 and the remaining

amount during the pendency of the case, and therefore the

Petitioners are estopped from canvassing the matter further. I

reject this argument. The liquor shop was to be kept shut until

payment was made by the Petitioners. In any event, as held by

the Supreme Court in Pararajasekeram v. Vijayaratnam (1968)

76 NLR 470, The doctrine of estoppel cannot be invoked in the

face of a statue, for against a statute no estoppel can prevail.

Clearly, the decision of the Respondents is ultra vires.

In view of the above, there is no necessity for me to consider the

third argument of the Petitioners predicated on the doctrine of

double jeopardy.

The Respondents have taken up a spate of preliminary

objections for the first time in the written submissions. This

unhealthy practice shall be discouraged. If there are

preliminary objections, such objections shall be taken up at

least in the statement of objections to allow the Petitioner to

reply in the counter objections. I must also mention that

preliminary objections shall not be raised as a matter of routine.

Such practice contributes significantly to laws delays.

Having said so, let me briefly consider the said preliminary

objections.

7

The Respondents say only two of the three licensees of the liquor

shop have filed this application. According to the Respondents,

unless all three licensees are made parties, the application is not

maintainable. This is not necessary.

Then, the Respondents say the 3rd Petitioner has no locus standi

to be a Petitioner to this application because he is not a licensee.

This preliminary objection is counterproductive. If this position

is to be accepted, it can be equally said that none of the three

licensees were given a hearing prior to the impugned decision

contained in P7 being taken. The 3rd Petitioner has locus standi

because it is he who is alleged to have pleaded guilty to the

charges. The sum of Rs. 4,000,000 was ordered on this basis.

Next, the Respondents say there is no proper application before

this Court because the supporting affidavit to the petition has

been filed by the 3rd Petitioner who has no locus standi to be a

party to the application. As I have already explained, the 3rd

Petitioner has locus standi. In any event, the supporting

affidavit to the petition need not necessarily be by a party to the

application. Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal Rules 1990 only

requires an affidavit in support of the averments set out in the

petition.

The preliminary objection on acquiescence/estoppel has

already been dealt with.

The final preliminary objection is the Petitioners have not

exhausted alternative remedies, in that, they have not appealed

to the Minister in the manner provided by the rules under section

32(2)(c) of the Excise Ordinance. This objection is also

8

overruled. On the one hand, the availability of alternative

remedies does not oust the writ jurisdiction of this Court unless

the alternative remedies are equally effective. On the other hand,

the rules referred to have not been tendered by the Respondents

and the Court is unaware of such rules.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners informed the

Court during the course of the argument that the Petitioners will

not contest the case if they are required to pay only the

maximum amount legally permitted on compounding an offence

under section 56 of the Excise Ordinance, i.e. Rs. 500,000.

For the aforesaid reasons, I grant the relief as prayed for in

paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition and formally quash P7

by certiorari and, instead, order the Respondents to recover only

Rs. 500,000 by way of compounding the offence and to release

the balance sum already paid of Rs. 3,650,000 to the

Petitioners.

The application of the Petitioners is partly allowed. No costs.
