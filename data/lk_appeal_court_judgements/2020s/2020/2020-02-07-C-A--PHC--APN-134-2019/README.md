HON. JUSTICE ACHALA WENGAPPULI

The 1st and 2nd accused-petitioners, by their individual applications

(bearing Nos. CA(PHC)APN 134/2019 and CA(PHC)APN 135/2019),have

invoked the revisionary jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article 138

of the Constitution, seeking to revise an order made by the High Court of

Colombo on 01.11.2019 in case No. HC 7735/2015 refusing to enlarge them

on bail pending trial.

It is stated that the 1st accused-petitioner was indicted for

committing offences of trafficking in and possession of 1097.52 grams of

Heroin, which are punishable under Sections 54A(b) and 54A(d) of

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No.

13 of 1984, while the 2nd accused-petitioner was accused of aiding and

2

abetting the 1st accused-petitioner in commission of the offence of

possession of said quantity of Heroin.

Trial of the 1st and 2nd accused-petitioners had commenced on

16.01.2017 and the trial Court pronounced its judgment on 30.03.2017

convicting the 1st accused-petitioner only of possession of Heroin. The 2nd

accused-petitioner too was convicted for aiding and abetting the 1st

accused-petitioner in possession. The two accused-petitioners were

punished by the High Court, with the imposition of imprisonment for life

in respect of the offences they were convicted of.

The accused-petitioners have appealed against their conviction and

sentence. Their appeal bearing No. 222 - 223/17 was decided by this Court

on 02.10.2019 by setting aside the conviction and sentence imposed on

them and ordering a retrial. In the said judgment, this Court ordered the

Prison Authorities to produce the accused-petitioners in the High Court on

21.10.2019" ... to decide on bail by the learned High Court Judge."

On that day, both accused-petitioners have made applications to the

High Court to enlarge them on bail pending retrial. The prosecution

resisted the application and the High Court, having considered the

submissions of the Counsel, refused bail. In compliance of the directive of

this Court, the High Court decided to take the trial against the accused-

petitioners expeditiously and fixed 1st, 5th, 8th and 11th of November 2019 as

dates of trial with the agreement of all Counsel of the accused-petitioners.

However, on 1st November 2019, the trial did not commence. The

prosecution had informed the High Court that its main witness, IP

3

Rangajeewa, is named as an accused in a trial before the Permanent High

Court at Bar in case No. 493/19 and he is unable to give evidence with a

focused or concentrated mind (" @)J.!ll/3tl) C'ltl)J~tl)JacU) in the instant

prosecution. Learned Prosecutor submitted that the witness's evidence, if

taken under such stressful circumstances, would adversely affect his case.

Learned Prosecutor was hopeful that the trial of the PW1 would be

concluded "soon" and the High Court to postpone the trial against the

accused-petitioners to a date in January 2020.

Learned President's Counsel, who represented the accused-

petitioners, have thereafter strongly urged the High Court to consider bail,

since it is not possible to predict the time that would be taken to conclude

the trial of the PW1, which is pending before the Permanent High Court at

Bar. They urged that the two accused-petitioners were incarcerated for

well over a six-year period, pending their trial and appeal.

In replying to the submissions of the learned President's Counsel, it

is stated by the learned State Counsel that he had based his objection to

bail upon a report tendered by the Officer-in-Charge of the Police

Narcotics Bureau (P6). This report was issued by the said officer in respect

of the 1st accused-petitioner. In this report it is alleged that the 1st accused-

petitioner poses a flight risk. This concern was expressed by the said

Officer, after conducting "investigations" in respect of the 1st accused-

petitioner, which had revealed that he is planning to leave Sri Lanka

illegally, if enlarged on bail.

This contention of the prosecution was strongly challenged by the

learned President's Counsel who represented the accused-petitioners

4

before the High Court. They submitted the following grounds for

consideration of the High Court as exceptional circumstances.

a. the sources through which the Officer-in-Charge had obtained

information that the 1st accused-petitioner poses flight risk is not

disclosed,

b. one of the three grounds of objection to bail is the serving of a

"life sentence" imposed on the 1st accused-petitioner, which in

fact, had already been set aside by the Court of Appeal and is

indicative of the "malice" of the officer concerned towards the

said accused- petitioner,

c. the detecting officer had admitted as having made false entries,

d. there were two other suspects who were arrested subsequent to

the arrest of the 1st accused-petitioner, whilst occupying an

undisclosed apartment and, having introduced the drugs which

was in their possession to the said accused-petitioners, the

officers have let those two suspects off from any criminal

proceedings. During the appeal, learned Deputy Solicitor General

who appeared for the Respondent could not provide an answer

when this issue was raised.

The 2nd accused-petitioner contended that;

a. the report of the Officer-in-Charge of PNB is dated 01.11.2017,

b. the "life sentence" imposed, has in fact already been set aside by

the Court of Appeal,

c. although the learned Prosecutor "gave evidence" before the High

Court, that the two other unknown suspects who were later

5

arrested were enlarged on bail, nowhere during the previous trial

it was shown that they were released from the proceedings,

d. it was wrong to incarcerate the accused-petitioners simply

because PWI is under stress of a criminal trial.

After the submissions of the Counsel, the High Court had proceeded

to consider them and concluded that there were no circumstances that

were revealed before it, which warranted it to reconsider the order it had

made on 23.10.2019, in refusing bail.

When the two applications of revision filed by the 1st and 2nd

accused-petitioners were taken up for hearing before this Court on

23.01.2020, it was indicated by the learned President's Counsel that a

common ruling could be pronounced on the two applications although the

circumstances relating to each of them are slightly different.

In support of their contention of the illegality of the impugned order

of the High Court in these two applications, the accused-petitioners have

sought to challenge the legality of the said order on following grounds;

1. although the High Court, had considered that it should

reconsider the order of 23.10.2019 in respect of bail, it had

desisted from doing so, mainly due to the new ground that

had been urged by the prosecution that there exists a flight

risk,

ii. there was no material that is sufficient to justify that there is a

flight risk other than a bare assertion by the Officer-in-Charge

in the report P6, which was tendered to Court rather

6

belatedly. In the objection filed by the Complainant

Respondent, the Officer-in-Charge of PNB asserted that there

exists a "very high likelihood" of the 2nd accused-petitioner

"fleeing the country through illegal/illegitimate means and

absconding the trial" and making such unfounded allegations

against the accused-petitioners clearly indicative of malice

against them.

iii. the 1st accused-petitioner IS in remand since his arrest on

13.02.2013 while the 2nd accused-petitioner, although initially

enlarged on bail pending the instant trial, was re-remanded

upon an allegation of his subsequent involvement of an

abetment to possess 85 kg of Heroin whilst on bail, which had

later ended up with his subsequent discharge from that

proceedings.

In support of their application to this Court seeking to enlarge them

on bail, learned President's Counsel submitted that:

a. the accused-petitioners have long been continually incarcerated

for a period well over six years upon this allegation without bail,

b. the allegation of a flight risk is not based on any material, but a

bare assertion, made out of malice towards the accused-

petitioners,

c. in ordering a re-trial, this Court had directed the High Court to

"conclude this case expeditiously", but due to circumstances that

are not directly attributable to the accused-petitioners, their trial

7

could not be concluded "expeditiously" and had no prospect of

even commencing it in the near future,

The indictment against the accused-petitioners allege that they have

committed offences which had been described under Section 54A of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended. Section

83(1) of the said Ordinance reads "No person suspected or accused of an offence

under Section 54A or Section 54B of this Ordinance shall be released on bail,

except by the High Court in exceptional circumstances."

In determining the question of bail for any suspect or accused

against whom an allegation of commission of an offence under Section 54A

or 54B of the said Ordinance, such suspect or accused would have to

satisfy the High Court of the existence of "exceptional circumstances" if he

is to be enlarged on bail.

In Shiyam v Officer-in-Charge, Police Narcotics Bureau & another

(2006) 2 Sri L.R. 156, the Supreme Court had determined that the

provisions in the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997 would have no application in

relation to the suspects or accused who have been alleged to have

committed an offence under Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance.

The conceptual as well as practical connotations that are involved in

applying the requirement of "exceptional circumstances" in relation to

instances of bail pending appeal, had received consideration by the then

Supreme Court in the judgment of Thamotharampillai v Attorney General

(reported subsequently in (2004) 3 Sri L.R. 180). This judgment was

8

generally followed by the Courts as the binding judicial precedent which

dealt extensively with the concept of "exceptional circumstances".

Their Lordships were considering the question, if bail was to grant

to a convicted accused, pending his appeal; whether to continue with the

then applicable requirement of the existence of exceptional circumstances,

which was a statutory requirement imposed under Section 15(1) of the

Court of Criminal Appeal Act, when the newly enacted Section 325(3) of

the Administration of Justice Law No. 44 of 1973 which repealed the

provisions of the said Act, had not imposed such a statutory requirement.

Having considered the applicable statutory provisions, several

authorities on the point and the practicalities that are involved in the

exercise of the discretion the Legislature has conferred on the Courts,

Vythialingam J, stated in the said judgment;

'That the intention of the legislature in enacting section

325(3) was not to make the grant of bail a matter of course

unless good grounds were shown to the contrary is made

clear by section 325(2). That sub-section enacts that when an

appeal against an acquittal is lodged the court may issue a

warrant directing that the accused be arrested and brought

before it and may commit him to prison pending the

determination of the appeal or admit him to bail. If convicted

persons have a right to be out on bail pending the

determination of their appeal unless good grounds are shown

to the contrary then it is absolutely essential that persons

acquitted of any charge should be free pending the

9

determination of the appeal against their acquittal, for there

is no conviction against them at all. Yet the legislature has

thought it fit to vest in the court a discretion to commit even

such persons to prison or admit them to bail pending the

determination of the appeal.

It may well be that this was because persons who are

acquitted may leave the country and so put themselves

outside the jurisdiction of the Courts of this country, except

through the difficult and expensive process of extradition.

But the exercise by the court of the discretion under this sub-

section is not limited by the Act to this ground alone. The

discretion is very wide and may be exercised by the court in

appropriate circumstances. It is, however, unnecessary for

the purpose of this case to consider in what circumstances

the court would exercise the power vested in it by section

325(2).

It is clear that these were the applicable considerations that are

identified by the Court in respect of consideration of applications for bail

pending appeal. The operative criterion was clearly the existence of

exceptional circumstances. The Supreme Court had deliberately desisted

from defining the term "exceptional circumstances" or to list out what

could be considered as "exceptional circumstances".

A similar discretion is vested in the High Court, as found in the

wording of Section 83(1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance, when it was amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

10

The said Section which reads, "No person suspected or accused of an

offence under Section 54A or Section 54B of this Ordinance shall be released on

bail, except by the High Court in exceptional circumstances", and as such

imposes a limitation on the discretion of Courts, in explicit terms, of

granting bail to the class of suspects or accused it had specified, should be

done, only" in exceptional circumstances".

In applying the discretion conferred upon Courts by the enactment

of the said provision of law, the Courts have insisted on the establishment

of exceptional circumstances by the prospective applicant for bail. The

manner in which the Courts should exercise such discretion was

considered by the Supreme Court in Thamotharampillai v Attorney

General (supra) as it is stated that;

"Where a statute vests discretion in a Court it is of course

unwise to confine its exercise within narrow limits by rigid

and inflexible rules from which Court is never at liberty to

depart. Nor indeed can there be found any absolutes or

formula which would invariably give an answer to different

problems which may be posed in different cases on different

facts. The decision must in each case depend on its own

peculiar facts and circumstances.

But in order that like cases may be decided alike and that

there will be ensured some uniformity of decisions it is

necessary that some guidance should be laid down for the

exercise of that discretion."

11

In identifying such instances, the Supreme Court had quoted the

following dicta from the judgment of The Queen v Cornelis Silva 74 NLR

113 with approval, where Weeramantry J stated grounds that are "no means

extraordinary" and "common to many accused person" would not satisfy

the criterion of "exceptional circumstances", which warrants grant of bail.

Their Lordships have thought it fit to add that" ... interference with one's

occupation, professional activities, business or trade are not circumstances which

ordinarily would entitle to a person to be allowed to stand on bail, where the

charges is serious and sentence heavy. The fact that he has not been charged in any

Court previously is not also not a relevant circumstance."

With these reasoning of Thamotharampillai v Attorney General

(supra) in mind, this Court now proceeds to consider the revision

applications filed by the two accused-petitioners.

The main thrust of the challenge mounted on the validity of the

order of the High Court, in its refusal to grant bail, was on the continued

incarceration of the two accused-petitioners, which period now exceeds six

years in total, due to non-availability of the main prosecution witness. It

was urged that the High Court was not in a position to carry out the

direction of this Court by taking up the re-trial expeditiously itself is an

exceptional ground.

It is submitted by learned President's Counsel that the 1st accused-

petitioner was in continued detention since his arrest on 13.02.2013 to date

while the 2nd accused-petitioner, who was initially enlarged on bail was re-

remanded on 06.05.2016, upon an application by the prosecution on the

basis that he had re-offended whilst on bail by committing a drug offence.

12

This subsequent allegation against the 2nd accused-petitioner was later

withdrawn and he had been discharged from the relevant criminal

proceedings.

The 1st accused-petitioner, as evident from the record, was in

remand over a period of almost seven years. The 2nd accused petitioner,

after his re-remand order, has spent over three and half years in remand

custody. It is correct that their freedom was curtailed by long periods of

legal custody, when the years are counted from the date of arrest and

remand.

However, it must be noted that their status differed significantly

during this period of time. They were initially remanded as suspects with

the detection of dangerous drugs. Then when the indictment was served

their status changed in to accused from suspects. Still they were protected

by the presumption of innocence. After they were convicted, and pending

determination of their appeal, their status altered to that of accused-

appellants, but no presumption of innocence applied. Then the re-trial was

ordered and the accused- petitioners have returned to the state of being

accused.

When the appeal of the accused-petitioners was lodged after their

conviction and sentence on 30.03.2017, as noted above their status changed

to convicted prisoners. Until the appeal was decided on 02.10.2019, they

remain in the status of accused-appellants. Over this 31-month long period

they spent in remand pending determination of appeal could not be

termed as a period pending trial and had to be excluded from the

equation. The trial had taken only about two and half months to reach its

13

conclusion. When viewed in the light of the different status where

different criterion is applied in relation to bail, the submissions that the

accused-petitioners have spent very long time awaiting their trial is not a

very accurate reflection of the material that had been placed before the

High Court.

On the issue of long period of detention pending appeal, the judicial

precedents clearly indicate that fact itself had not been considered as an

"exceptional circumstance" for granting of bail. The determination that"

... the delay in deciding the appeal would not amount to an exceptional

ground" is the consistently adopted and followed approach by the

superior Courts as indicative from the judgment of Court of Criminal

Appeal by Basnayake CJ, in The Queen v Rupasinghe Perera 62 N.L.R. 228

and The Queen v Comelis Silva 74 NLR 114 where Weeramantry J

delivered the judgment.

The question in relation to the detention pending trial has been

considered by this Court in Cader v Officer-in-Charge of Narcotic Bureau

(2006) 3 Sri L.R. 74, where Basnayake J, having posed the question, "Could

we consider the period in remand as a ground constituting an exceptional

circumstance?" had thereafter proceeded to answer it in following terms,

in the light of the six instances cited as precedents where bail had been

considered favourably by this Court;

"Provision has been made in the Bail Act to release persons

on bail if the period of remand extends more than 12 months.

No such provision is found in the case of Poison, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Although bail was granted in

14

some of the cases mentioned above. None of these cases refer

to the time period in remand as constituting an exceptional

circumstance. Hence bail cannot be considered on that

ground alone. It appears from the cases cited above that there

is no guiding principle with regard to the quantity found

either. The fact of despatching the indictment too cannot be

considered either for or against the granting of bail. In one of

the cases mentioned above, the fact of not sending the

indictment was considered in favour of granting bail while

in another case, sending the indictment was not considered

to refuse bail."

When the impugned order of the High Court is considered in the

principles enunciated in the judgments referred to above, this Court is

unable to be in agreement with the submissions made by the accused-

petitioners, in support of their revision applications that the impugned

order of the High Court in refusing their bail is not a legally tenable one.

The accused-petitioners have relied upon the judgment of this Court

in CA (PHC) APN 38/2019 - decided on 01.08.2019 where the accused-

petitioner was successful in obtaining bail pending trial. However, the

circumstances are quite different in the matter before the Court of Appeal

in the said application. In the said application, the Court of Appeal had

held "learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the Petitioner

was already on bail by this Court, and the fact that the conviction was set

aside and retrial has been ordered."

15

In the instant matter, this Court had directed the High Court to

consider bail but had not enlarged them on bail when it decided to set

aside the conviction and sentence. Hence, the issue to be determined is

whether the High Court had exercised its discretion judicially in refusing

to enlarge the accused-petitioners on bail pending trial.

The question when does a revision lie was considered in depth in

the judgment of Kulatilake v Attorney General (2010) 1 Sri L.R. 212, where

it was held;

"It is trite Law that the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court

would be exercised if and only if exceptional circumstances

are in existence to file such an application. Moreover, it must

be noted that the Courts would exercise the revisionary

jurisdiction, it being an extra ordinary power vested in

Court, especially to prevent miscarriage of justice being done

to a person and/or for the due administration ofjustice."

It was noted by the Court of Appeal in R v Rehman and Wood

(2006) 1 Cri App Rep(S) 77 that:

"There will be cases where there is one single striking

feature, which relates either to the offence or offender, which

causes that case to fall within the requirement of exceptional

circumstances. There can be other cases where no single factor

by itself will amount to exceptional circumstances, but the

16

collective impact of all the relevant circumstances truly makes

the case exceptional."

Therefore, this Court must then consider the question whether the

accused-petitioners have established exceptional circumstances before the

High Court to its satisfaction and thereafter, in order to exercise powers of

revision of this Court over the impugned order of the High Court, whether

the accused-petitioners have established exceptional circumstances.

Therefore, this Court will first consider the question whether the

accused-petitioners were denied bail pending trial by the High Court

when they have established exceptional circumstances for them to be

enlarged on bail. In this undertaking this Court will have to consider the

material placed by the accused-petitioners, and decide whether there was

one striking feature or whether the collective impact that could have been

consider by the High Court as exceptional.

The grounds that were placed before the High Court were already

referred to in this judgment. The complaints that the sources on which the

Officer-in-Charge asserted that there was flight risk were not disclosed

cannot be an exceptional circumstance, although it would have been very

much better if there was some material placed before the High Court

adding credence to the investigation said to have been carried out by the

PNB, enabling the High Court to exercise the discretion rather than

making a bare statement in the report and in the affidavit. However,

considering the ages of the two accused-petitioners, both being in their late

17

,

twenties are subjected to a sentence of life, it is reasonable to assume that

there exists a probable flight risk.

Even in Thamotharampillai v Attorney General (supra) the

Supreme Court justified remanding an accused pending appeal against his

acquittal in view of a flight risk as it was observed that,

U If convicted persons have a right to be out on bail pending

the determination of their appeal unless good grounds are

shown to the contrary then it is absolutely essential that

persons acquitted of any charge should be free pending the

determination of the appeal against their acquittal, for there

is no conviction against them at all. Yet the legislature has

thought it fit to vest in the court a discretion to commit even

such persons to prison or admit them to bail pending the

determination of the appeal.

It may well be that this was because persons who are

acquitted may leave the country and so put themselves

outside the jurisdiction of the Courts of this country, except

through the difficult and expensive process of extradition. U

The misstatement in the objections of the Officer-in-Charge that the

accused-petitioners are currently under a life sentence as a fact, construed

by them as indicative of malice towards them, though made irresponsibly,

could well be a result of failure to update their records.

18

>

In relation to the contention that the "disappearance" of two

suspects, who were later arrested on the same day, learned Deputy

Solicitor General made submissions that in fact they have been discharged

from criminal proceedings by the Hon. Attorney General, and during the

appeal hearing he could not appraise Court since he was unaware of that

factual position at that point of time.

The fact that PW1 had made inconsistent notes as to his

whereabouts is clearly a matter for the High Court to consider at the

appropriate stage. The application for bail was made by the accused-

petitioners before the re-trial was commenced. The credibility of a witness

will have to be addressed by a trial Court after the material evidence had

been placed before it and not otherwise.

The ground that bail was refused because the prosecution witness is

under the stress of a criminal trial was not directly considered by the High

Court in denying bail but only in the context of postponing the scheduled

trial.

Thus, it is clear that the High Court's decision to deny bail pending

trial was due to non-establishment of exceptional circumstances and due

to the reasons already considered, could not be faulted.

In its judgment of Attorney General v Ediriweera 2006 [B.L.R.] 12,

the Supreme Court had sought to identify a criterion in determining

whether a particular situation could be considered as exceptional. It has

been stated by the apex Court that "exceptional circumstances only exist,

when the fact and circumstances of the case are such that they constrain or impel

19

the Court to the conclusion that justice can only be done by the granting of bail. "

When the said criterion is applied to the material placed before the High

Court by the accused-petitioners, the conclusion reached by the Court is

quite justified since no exceptional circumstances were made out.

In R v Rehman and Wood (supra), Lord Woolf CJ also stated that:

" ... it is the opinion of the Court that is critical as to what

exceptional circumstances are. Unless the judge is clearly

wrong in identifying exceptional circumstances when they do

not exist, or clearly wrong in not identifying exceptional

circumstances when they do exist, this Court will not readily

interfere."

The High Court, in making the impugned order, is not in the wrong

when it did not identify any exceptional circumstances when they did not

actually exist. In relation to the existence of exceptional circumstances

warranting exercise of revisionary powers conferred on this Court, it is

clear that the grounds that were relied upon is essentially impinges on the

long period of incarceration as its underlying theme. None of these could

be considered as grounds that are "extraordinary" and are not "common

to many accused persons".

In Attorney General v Ediriweera (supra), the Supreme Court

observed that:

20

. "

" delay is always a relative term and the question to be

considered is not whether there was mere explicable delay, as

when there is backlog of cases, but whether there has been

excessive or oppressive delay and this always depends on the

facts and circumstances of the case. Where delay in bringing a

man to the conclusion of his litigation is as great as to the

amount of oppression a Court will only then interfere and

grant bail."

Hence, the accused-petitioners have failed to satisfy the requisite

criterion in exercising revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

The accused-petitioners have sought an order from this Court

enlarging them on bail. Learned President's Counsel submitted that the

non-availability of PWI would extend to several months upon the

information they received. Learned Deputy Solicitor General however

claimed that very soon, the prosecution would be able to commence and

conclude the trial.

It is therefore evident that the prospect of the commencement of the

trial and the time period involved with it is at variance with each party to

this application. The next date of trial is fixed in February 2020. This Court

therefore leaves the question of bail pending trial to the relevant High

Court because it is that Court which could assess any application for bail

realistically and exercise its discretion in favour of the accused-petitioners,

if they could satisfy that there exist exceptional circumstances.

21

The applications of the 1st and 2nd accused-petitioners are

accordingly refused.

Their petitions are dismissed without costs.
