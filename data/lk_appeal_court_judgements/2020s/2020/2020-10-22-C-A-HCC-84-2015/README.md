Accused-Appellant not produced by the Prison Authorities due to

Covid pandemic.

Learned Counsel for the 3rd Accused-Appellant informs Court that

she has received specific instructions to proceed with the hearing of the

appeal in the absence of the Accused-Appellant.

1 st and 2nd accused are absent and unrepresented they are tried in

absentia.

This is an appeal where the 1st to 2nd Accused and the 3rd Accused-

Appellant were indicted by the Hon. Attorney General for committing

murder and the trial was concluded in the absence of the 1 st and the 2 nd

Accused with the participation of the 300 Accused- Appellant, resulting in

their conviction to the said offence.

2

At the hearing of the appeal preferred by the 3rd Accused- Appellant,

learned counsel submitted that the sole eyewitness's evidence does not

support the conviction for murder since, according to the said witness, the

three Accused have only used "thin poles" to assault the deceased who

was standing when the witness rushed to the scene upon hearing a noise.

The deceased had thereafter collapsed on the ground.

The three Accused have left the scene carrying their poles with

them. There is no evidence led by the prosecution as to the circumstances

under which the admission of the deceased to the hospital was made. He

died soon after. The first information was provided by the hospital staff to

the police station.

Learned Counsel for the Accused- Appellant also drew our attention

to the medical evidence which indicate that the deceased had suffered two

stab injuries along with one cut injury, and submitted that the sole

eyewitness's account does not explain in any way of infliction of these

injuries, which had in fact resulted in death of the deceased. Therefore,

she submits that the conviction based on the said witness cannot be

maintained owing to unreliability of the evidence.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General in his reply submitted

that the three Accused have beaten up the deceased severely. However, he

concedes that there is no evidence as to who had inflicted the stab injuries

on the deceased which had resulted in his death.

3

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that in the absence

of evidence as to who carried the weapon by which the said stab injuries

were inflicted on the deceased and in the absence of evidence as to who

was responsible for the stab injuries, the three Accused could only be

convicted for culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of

knowledge, since their complicity is restricted to assault with "thin poles".

The conviction against the 3 rd Accused- Appellant was entered on

28. 07. 2015 and since then he was in remand pending determination of

his appeal.

The clear evidence that has been presented before the trial Court

confines to beating of the deceased using sticks which the sole eye witness

described as very "thin sticks".

Therefore, this Court set aside the conviction for murder entered

against all three Accused by the High Court and substitute with a

conviction for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

The each of the Accused are imposed a imprisonment for a period of

sixty two ( 62 ) months and that the said term of imprisonment in relation

to the 3rd Accused- Appellant, in view of the fact that he had been

incarcerated since his conviction, should run from the date of conviction,

namely 28.07.2015.

4

In relation to the 1st and 2nd Accused their terms of imprisonment

should run as and when they are arrested and produced before the High

Court.

In addition to the imposition of 62 months of imprisonment each

Accused is imposed of a fine of Rs. 1000/-, default of which another

period of six months of imprisonment is imposed.

In relation to the 3rd Accused- Appellant, the two sentences of

imprisonment should run concurrently.

The appeal of the 3rd Accused- Appellant is partly allowed subject to

the above variations.
