Hon. Justice A.L. Shiran Gooneratne

Petitioner-Appellant is absent and unrepresented.

The Registrar of this Court has listed this case for an order of Court in terms of

Rule 3(14) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure Rule 1990).

Perusal of journal entry dated 04/10/2019 and 14/01/2020 in the docket

shows that the Appellant has failed to take steps to pursue this application.

Rule 3 (13) states that, it shall be the duty of the Petitioner to take such

steps as may be necessary to prosecute his application with due diligence.

It is the view of this Court that the Petitioner is not interested in pursuing

this application any further. In these circumstances the Court decides to reject

the application.

Application rejected.

Hon. Justice Dr. Ruwan Fernando

I agree.
