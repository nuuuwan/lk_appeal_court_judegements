The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of

Colombo on two counts,for trafficking in 147 grams of heroin and

at the same time , place and in the same transaction for being in

possession of 147 grams of heroin on 10.06.2013, which are

offences punishable under Sec 54 A (d) and 54 A (b) of the Poisons,

1

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by act No 13

of 1984.

The accused pleaded not guilty and after trial the learned

High Court Judge by judgment dated 20.11.2017 found the

appellant guilty of the two charges and sentenced him to death.

Aggrieved by the said judgment the accused appellant (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the appellant) has preferred this appeal.

At the appeal the following grounds of appeal were submitted

on behalf of the appellant.

1. Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into

consideration the serious contradictory positions taken up by

the two main witnesses who participated in the raid namely

PW 01 and PW 11- Test of credibility.

2. Learned High Court Judge had failed to apply the test of

probability in the correct prospect.

3. Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into

consideration that the prosecution had failed to prove the

chain of productions.

4. Learned High Court Judge had refused the defence evidence

on unreasonable grounds.

3

The facts pertaining to this case albeit briefly are as follows;

The prosecution relied mainly on the evidence of PW 1 SI

Nalawansa and PW 11 PS Terence with regard to the raid and the

detection of heroin in the possession of the appellant.

The evidence of SI Nalawansa the Officer-In-Charge of the

crimes division of the Mount Lavinia Police is that he received

information from an informant at 3.00 am on 10.06.2013 that a

three wheeler transporting heroin was due to arrive in Aththidiya

Perakum Mawatha. This information is based on an ongoing

investigation .He has left the police station after searching the six

officers and the vehicle and had reached Perakum Mawatha in

Aththtidya by about 3.30 am and was at that point for about 3

hours till about 6.30 am and then left to Upananda Mawatha

where they were waiting in anticipation for the three wheeler.

The green coloured three wheeler bearing registered No WP-

GU 7462 that came around 8.30 am on Perakum Mawatha was

identified as the three wheeler they were waiting for, was followed

by this team for a distance of about three and a half kilometers for

about 45 minutes on several roads without drawing the attention

of the three wheeler driver. When the three wheeler was stopping

on the 16th lane on Embillawatte road at about 8.45 am (pg 108),

the officers have alighted from the police vehicle and quickly

walked to the three wheeler and confronted the driver and taken

him in to custody who was about to enter his house carrying a bag.

After searching, the police found 4 parcels containing heroin inside

4

the bag that had the name Arjuna Jewellers. After the house of the

suspect was searched, the three wheeler has been driven away by

officer PC 77489 Sam path to the Mount Lavinia police station and

the accused-appellant was brought to the Police Narcotics Bureau

where the heroin was weighed, packed and his left thumb

impression was placed on the parcel.

The officer PW 12 Police Sergeant Jayathillake who gave

evidence for the prosecution who was at the Police Narcotics

Bureau reserve that morning has facilitated the machine to weigh

the heroin and the cellophane bags to put the heroin but had not

participated in any other way.

After having tea there, the officers have left the Police

Narcotics Bureau together with the sealed heroin back to

Aththidiya Perakum Mawatha and the 16th lane on Embillawatte

road to look for the main Suspect (gOJeD e:l(;Q)OO(;) without success

and have returned to the Mount Lavinia police station around

23.30 on 10.06.2013 and handed over the suspect and the sealed

production to the reserve officer ManjuZa Jayasekera PW 7 on

11.06.2013 at 2.05 under receipt no. 147/13 and 148/13,

149/3,150/13,151/13,152/13 and 153/13.

PW 7 has accepted the production and the suspect and had

handed over same on the lIth at 6.08 am to PW 9, PC 74775

Rajapakse, and he, at 7.43 has handed over same to PC 13578

5

Rajapakse who in return has handed it over to PW 11, PS 41026

Terence who has collected the production entered notes in IB page

47 paragraph 470 in GCBRI 320/63 and finally has handed over

to the production clerk of the Nugegoda courts A.D Perera.

The prosecution led the evidence of the Government Analyst

and other witnesses who were involved with the custody of the

production. The Government Analyst has testified that the seals

were untampered at the time of arrival at the Government Analyst

Department. The evidence of PW 1 and PW 11 with regard to the

production is corroborated.

The accused-appellant denied that he was arrested as

described by the prosecution witnesses. His position was described

in the dock statement that some officers from the Mount Lavinia

Police (PW 1 was not a participant) came around 3.30 in the

morning and took him, the wife and her daughter together with the

three wheeler to the police station and kept the wife and the

daughter for a day and released them, and filed action against him

and he is innocent of this offence.

It is to be mentioned here that the person he refers to as his

wife G.Nishanthi Gunawardhane is not his legal wife, but a

married woman with a daughter.( the appellant has left his legal

wife) Nishanthi is from Batovita who was selling rice packets when

she met the accused with whom she has been living for about 2

6

years when he was arrested. They have lived in her house in

Batovita initially, and about six months prior to the incident, have

been renting the downstairs of the house on the 16th lane where

the appellant was arrested. Nishanthi's daughter Kandage Nilakshi

Sandarekha and Nishanthi's sister Duriyangodage Krishanthi

Gunawardhane have given evidence for the appellant.

The following facts were contended as regards the

improbability of the version of the prosecution. That PW 1 who

alleges that he received the information at 3.00 am could not have

left the police station at 3.00 am itself as he has stated that he

searched the six officers and the vehicle before leaving and arriving

at Perakum Mawatha around 6.20 or 6.30 am; the out entry does

not reflect the information received ; as per the information

received the number of the three wheeler, the colour or the time of

arrival was not mentioned therefore doubt as to how the particular

three wheeler was identified; PW 1 's evidence being that they first

proceeded to Perakum Mawatha and after waiting there for a few

hours, proceeding to Upananda Mawatha, which is not

corroborated by PW 11, as he mentions going to Upananda

Mawatha straight away is contradictory; how a police jeep could

have followed the three wheeler for 45 minutes without being

noticed and arousing suspicion and therefore, prosecution version

not being plausible.

In the above backdrop I will venture to consider the grounds

of appeal as urged by the counsel for the appellant.

7

It is trite law that there is no requirement that the evidence

of a police officer who conducted an investigation/ raid need to be

corroborated in material particulars. (Attorney General us

Devundarage Nihal S.C. Appeal 154/100 (C.A.87/97 A.G Vs

Mohamed Sa heed) decided on 13.07. 1999.

In the instant case PW 11 who was the driver of the vehicle

used in the raid and the officer who handed over the production to

the Nugegoda Magistrate's Court has been called to corroborate

the evidence of PW 1.

SI Nalawansa who conducted the raid has clearly evidenced

that this raid is pursuant to an investigation that was going on for

sometime. In his evidence in chief he has stated that as the

information was received at 3.00 am, he searched the officers and

the vehicle and left at 3 am, which created a doubt as contended

by the counsel for the appellant as one cannot get information and

leave at the same time as evidenced by PWl. This point has not

been clarified at the trial court. However, at no point has PW 1

stated that the search was not done and no suggestion to that

effect had been made by the defence either. It is also to be

considered that it will not take a very long time to search an officer

at that time in the morning, even if the officers were just frisked.

Further, there was no allegation of the drugs being introduced by

the police in the instant case. As the roads are presumed to be

clear in the morning it can be assumed that they reached

Aththidiya at about 3.20 am.

8

It has been noticed in the proceedings that both the

prosecutor and the defence counsel have, when an answer is given

referring to a particular time by a witness, the counsel leads or

suggests the question changing the time that was given in the

answer. For example when answer was given that they reached

Perakum Mawatha at 6.20 the question starts with, at "6.30".

Likewise when the answer given in reaching the 16th lane is 08.45

am, the question changes the time to "9.00" am, and the witness

is led on that time.

In that particular instance, it was suggested that the notes

were written by PW 1 at 9.15, after searching the house on the 16th

lane, and suggestion was made that it could not have been, when

considering the fact the witness stating that it had taken about

half an hour to search the house. It is clear that this is somewhat

misleading the witness.

Although they may seem trivial on the surface, when the

evidence relating to time is considered to asses the credibility of

the evidence, the counsel have to be mindful of these facts,

otherwise it will mislead the witness. In my opinion these are

instances that the trial judges should be on alert.

With regard to leaving the police station for the raid, PW 11

has said they were on standby to go out for a search and on the

receipt of information to PW 1, they left at 3.00 am. The contention

9

that this fact establishes that there was no information received

from an informant is not tenable.

Although it is correct that there is no narration as such of all

the details of the information received by PW 1 regarding the

vehicle colour, number and time of arrival he has answered the

prosecutors question without any hesitation providing the

information received which led to this raid. There was no doubt

created about receiving information as PW 1 has reiterated that

this raid was pursuant to an ongoing investigation and PW 11 's

evidence has corroborated this evidence.

PW 11 gave evidence how PW 1 identified the three wheeler

when it came on Perakum Mawatha and directed him to follow it.

He explained how he drove the jeep keeping a distance of about

100 meters and falling back when the traffic was less. This attempt

was to avoid attention and not to create suspicion of the three

wheeler driver.

PW 11 's evidence corroborated the evidence of PW 1 on some

material points ,such as being stationed at Upananda Mawatha,

sighting of the three wheeler, following it, proceeding to 16th lane,

then observing the arrested accused together with the production,

proceeding to Police Narcotics Bureau to weigh the production,

and then going back to Aththidiya and later Embillawatthe Road

10

and waiting in anticipation of the main suspect and then returning

to the Police station in the night.

He too has made notes pertaining to his role in the raid. He

at several points has stated that he just followed instructions of

PW 1 who was directing him to proceed from place to place and he

cannot remember all the details of the roads he travelled that day.

Merely because he did not mention being on Perakum Mawatha,

before going to Upananda Mawatha, it cannot be considered that

there is contradictory evidence of PW 1 and PW lIon this point.

The Learned Trial Judge has considered that PW 11 has not

mentioned about waiting at Perakum Mawatha before proceeding

to Upananda Mawatha. He has concluded that when the three

wheeler was sighted, that both PW 1 and PW 11 have evidenced

that the vehicle was stationed at Upananda Mawatha. What is

relevant and material is where the vehicle was stationed when the

three wheeler was sighted.

The learned judge has analysed and assessed the evidence,

being careful and cautious to consider the evidence of PW 1 and

PW 11 when there are alleged discrepancies which were pointed

out in cross examination and has given plausible reasons for

arriving at his conclusion in pages 16, 17, 18 ( pages 525 to 527

of the brief) of the judgment.

11

The learned DSG in page 7 of the Written Submission has

referred to the following authorities for consideration of the Court.

Attorney General V. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 SLR 292, Shiraanee Tilakawardane,J. held (at page 303)

that whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinary

affect the trustworthiness of the witness' statement, it is well

established that the Court must exerCIse its judgment on the

nature and tenor of the inconsistency or contradiction and

whether they are material to the facts in issue. Discrepancies,

which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the basic

version ofthe witness, cannot be given too much importance (Vide,

Bogm Bhai Hirji Bhai V. State of Gujarat- AIR (1983) SC 753.)

Sunil V. Attorney-General (1999) 3 SLR 191 cited the case

of State of Uttar Pradesh V.Attomey-1985 AIR SC 48 " ..... the

witness should not be disbelieved on account of trivial

discrepancies especially where it is established that there is

substantial reproduction in the testimony of the witness in relation

to his evidence before the Magistrate or in the session Court and

that minor variation in language used by witness should not justify

the total rejection of his evidence."

In the light of the above authorities also it can be concluded

that the reasoning of the High Court Judge cannot be faulted in

12

the assessing of the evidence of PW 1 and PW 11, with which

conclusion this Court agree.

There was much debate about where the police vehicle was

stationed and how Perakum Mawatha and Upananda Mawatha

were situated and whether the alleged arrival of the three wheeler

on Perakum Mawatha could have been observed by the

prosecution witnesses.

PW 1 has evidenced regarding the position of the Upananda

Mawatha in the following manner.

The evidence elicits that Perakum Mawatha and Upananda

Mawatha are situated close to each other and that the three wheeler

could have been sighted from where the Police vehicle was stationed as

evidenced by PW 1 and PW 11.

14

The Counsel for the appellant's position IS that Perakum

Mawatha is Y2 Km away from Upananda Mawatha. But on a perusal of

the evidence it appears that the length of Perakum Mwatha is what has

been referred to as 1/2 km in length.

Considering all of the above, the ground of appeal urged

about the failure of the learned High Court Judge to consider the

contradictions in the evidence of PW 1 and PW 11 is not tenable.

Another ground urged by the counsel is that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to consider that the prosecution has failed to

prove the chain of production.

PW 1 testified that the appellant was taken in to custody together

with the production at about 9 am . PW 11 has not witnessed the actual

arrest as he was in the vehicle but a few moments later has witnessed

that the suspect had been taken in to custody. It is corroborated about

the weighing, packeting and sealing of the production at the Police

Narcotics Bureau. PW 12 Jayathillake at the Police Narcotics Bureau

although not actively participated had corroborated the above.

The production thereafter, has been in the custody of PW 1 until

his return to the Mount Lavinia police station in the night and handing

over same to PW 7 Manjula who testified to the receipt of same.

Thereafter, it has changed hands to PW 8, PC Indrasiri, PC 13578

Rajapakse who has handed it over to PW 11, then to the production

clerk and then to the Government Analyst Department, where there is

15

.

evidence that the production arrived untampered. Thus, I am of the view

that there is no merit in that ground of appeaL

It was also submitted for the appellant that the defence evidence

has been rejected on unreasonable grounds. In the judgment, pages 22

to 32 refer to the case of the defence where the learned High Court

Judge has very carefully assessed the evidence of the accused and the

three witnesses who gave evidence on his behalf.

In the Dock statement the appellant has stated that he was

assaulted by the police who came to his house at 3.30 in the morning.

But the prosecution witnesses were not confronted with this position.

The appellant has not denied the evidence that his finger prints were on

the production and he has not challenged the evidence. Therefore, no

explanation from him how this fingerprints are on the production. His

evidence has been that the police took the three of them together with

the three wheeler and the following day released the wife and daughter

and that he is innocent.

When cross examining PW 1, it was suggested that the police had

kept the key to the house of the accused for a few days. (in page 149 of

the brief) However, it has not been proved and it does not corroborate

with other evidence of the defence witnesses. Witness Nishanthi

testified that the house was not searched when they were taken away

and nothing was mentioned about the police keeping their house key

from the other witnesses.

16

j

.'

On a perusal of the evidence for the defence it is apparent that the

evidence of the defence witnesses has not affected the case for the

prosecution. The Learned High Court Judge has adequately considered

the evidence and the position taken by the defence that it has been

rejected on unreasonable grounds is not tenable.

When considering the totality of the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses, there is consistent evidence and no material discrepancies

have emerged. The probability factor of the prosecution witnesses have

not been affected by the cross examination or the evidence led on behalf

of the accused.

In the circumstances, I see no merit in the appeal and there is no

reason to interfere in the conviction or the sentence. Therefore, I affirm

the conviction and the sentence. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
