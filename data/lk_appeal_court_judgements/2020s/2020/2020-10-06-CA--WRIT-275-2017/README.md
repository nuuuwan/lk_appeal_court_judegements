Argued on: 27.08.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

As seen from inter alia P3 and P4, a portion of the Petitioners

land was acquired in or about 2012 under the Land Acquisition

Act for the road widening project of the Colombo-Kandy road,

apparently for the Imbulgoda-Miriswatta stretch. The Petitioners

land is in Imbulgoda, in the Divisional Secretary area of

4

Gampaha. The Petitioner did not object to this acquisition.

Thereafter, a subsequent acquisition had taken place in 2014,

whereby some other parcels of land along the same road,

including a portion of the Petitioners land, were acquired. By

filing this application, the Petitioner challenges the aforesaid

second acquisition.

At the argument, learned Counsel for the Petitioner accepted

publication of the section 2 notice marked 1R1 dated

14.02.2013 and 2R1 dated 13.01.2014. As described in the said

notice, the public purpose for the second acquisition is supply

of additional facilities in connection with the broadening of Kandy

highway and acquiring of additional lands for common

relocation.

In connection with the second acquisition, the Petitioner in the

petition itself accepts publication of the following:

(a) order in terms of proviso (a) to section 38 of the Land

Acquisition Act in the gazette dated 20.06.2014 marked

P9;

(b) notice in terms of section 5 in the gazette dated

14.11.2014 marked P10; and

(c) notice in terms of section 7 in the gazette dated

17.11.2014 marked P11.

The Petitioner also tenders the Surveyor Generals plan marked

P12 dated 12.11.2014 depicting the subject land relevant to this

application.

As stated in the petition and particularly P15 dated 14.08.2017

(a letter sent to the subject Minister by the Petitioner about two

weeks before this application was filed in Court), the Petitioner

5

knew contemporaneously about the said steps taken for the

acquisition of additional parcels of land.

When the land to be acquired was surveyed in 2014, as seen

from the tenement list attached to the P12 plan, the Petitioner

laid claim to a portion of the land. This shows the Petitioners

awareness of the second acquisition from the early stages of the

process.

Although the Petitioner in the petition and in P15 says he

objected to the said second acquisition, there is no evidence of

such an objection. It appears to me the Petitioner thinks non-

participation at the section 9 inquiry into claims for

compensation amounts to objection to the acquisition. Non-

participation at the section 9 inquiry is not tantamount to

objecting to the acquisition in the eyes of the law. The 1st

Respondent Divisional Secretary, in paragraph 11 of his

statement of objections, and the 2nd Respondent Road

Development Authority, in paragraph 10 of its statement of

objections, state the Petitioner did not participate at the section

9 inquiry despite repeated notices. This is not disputed by the

Petitioner. The Petitioner did not challenge these notices or

decisions at the time they were issued or made.

In P15, the Petitioner says he did not take steps in this regard.

Let me quote the relevant portion of P15 for convenience to

understand the Petitioners grievance in his own words:

This letter shows that the Petitioner did not take meaningful

steps at the right time, if he was in fact vehemently opposed to

the second acquisition.

The Petitioner accepts that the area relevant to this application

is famous for wayside pineapple selling and, due to the road

widening project, wayside pineapple vendors businesses were

7

greatly affected. Those vendors need to be relocated. The land

depicted in P12 is to be used to construct stalls for pineapple

sellers. This will benefit the sellers as well as the general public,

i.e. purchasers.

The Petitioner says the second acquisition is for a commercial

purpose and not a public purpose. I am unable to accept this

argument given the circumstances of this case. Although these

stalls will be leased out for money, that does not mean there is

no public purpose. The acquisition is not to construct pineapple

stalls for monetary gain, but to supply additional facilities in

connection with the broadening of the Kandy highway and for

common relocation. There is no political motivation behind this

acquisition as the Petitioner vaguely attempted to portray at the

argument.

The Respondents tender the Agreement dated 26.06.2017

marked 2R1, entered into between the 2nd Respondent and the

Provincial Road Development Authority (Western Province), for

the construction of pineapple stalls in accordance with the

layout plan dated 11.01.2017 marked 2R3. These steps were

taken prior to this application filed in Court.

The project is underway and learned State Counsel for the

Respondents informed Court during the argument that 24 stalls

have already been constructed and the construction of 16 stalls,

as depicted in 2R3, has been temporarily halted because of this

case.

The Petitioner, in his counter objections, referring to another

Agreement of the same date as 2R1 between the same parties,

says that in terms of the said other Agreement, stalls have been

8

constructed and the objective of the state has been achieved.

Therefore, the Petitioner says he has a legitimate expectation of

revocation of the vesting order or a divesting order in respect of

the subject land. I cannot accept this argument. In my view,

this being a writ application, this argument goes against the

Petitioner. As a result of filing this application, the Respondents

could not complete the entire project, only part of it was

completed. Now the Petitioner says the objective has been

achieved and therefore there is a legitimate expectation that a

revocation of the vesting order or divesting order be made by the

Minister in respect of his portion of land. A writ Court will not

countenance such conduct. The Respondents do not say the

objective (relocation of the pineapple sellers) has been fully

achieved.

The Petitioner slept over his rights, if any, and waited for nearly

three years from early 2014 before filing this application in the

latter part of 2017 when the construction work on the stalls was

about to commence.

By filing this application, the Petitioner seeks to quash by

certiorari the aforementioned section 5 notice, section 7 notice

and section 38 proviso (a) order made in 2014, which he was

aware of at that time. The Petitioner is guilty of laches. He also

seeks to issue a mandate in the nature of mandamus directing

the 6th Respondent subject Minister to revoke the vesting order

in terms of section 39(1) of the Act. In the facts and

circumstances of this case, no such order can be made. In the

alternative, the Petitioner seeks an order directing the Minister

to make a divesting order in terms of section 39A(1) of the Act.

When steps have been taken to implement the public purpose

9

for which the land was acquired, the Court cannot compel the

Minister by mandamus to make a divesting order.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner but without costs.

As agreed, the Petitioners in the connected case,

CA/WRIT/276/2017, will abide by this Judgment.
