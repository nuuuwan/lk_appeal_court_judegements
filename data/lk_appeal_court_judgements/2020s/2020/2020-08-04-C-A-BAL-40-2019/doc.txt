ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Petitioner has made an application to this Court, under Section

10(1)(a) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act No. 4 of 2015, seeking an order enlarging the Accused-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "Accused"), namely Payagala

Gamaralalage Ajith Priyankara Smarathunga, on bail.

The accused was employed as an Area Manager of the Sabaragamuwa

Province, by Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd., a Company fully owned by the

Government, which provided security services. The accused before his

employment at the said Company has served in Sri Lanka Army as a

Captain and had retired from active service upon medical grounds, in July

2006.

2

He is the accused in the Magistrate's Court of Balangoda case No.

59471, where he was charged under Section 345 of the Penal Code as

amended, upon an allegation of committing sexual harassment on one

Rukmal Devika Amarasena, who had served under the accused as a junior

security officer without being attached to the security division stationed at

the Sabaragamuwa University.

The trial against the accused in case No. 59471 commenced on

10.11.2016 and evidence of the virtual complainant was recorded by Court

on 18.05.2017.

He has another case pending in the same Magistrate's Court under

case No. 59472.

On 29.05.2017, a Letter of Demand was sent to the said virtual

complainant by an Attorney-at-law, who acted on instructions of the

accused, demanding Rs. 10 Million from her, for causing damage to the

accused's good reputation by making a false complaint against him.

A similar Letter of Demand was sent to one Osmond Yahampath, a

witness for the prosecution, in the said case No. 59471, pending before the

Magistrate's Court.

This development was reported to the Magistrate's Court and the

learned Magistrate had directed the Police to conduct investigations on

this complaint. Statements from the accused, his Attorneys who appeared

3

for him in the Magistrate's Court as well as who sent the Letters of

Demand, the virtual complainant and the witness were recorded.

Having considered the available material, the accused was indicted

by the Hon. Attorney General, before the High Court of Ratnapura for

committing offences under Section 8(1)(a) of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No. 4 of 2015. The

indictment was served on the accused in case No. HCR 233/2019 by the

High Court of Ratnapura on 14.11.2019.

The facts were reported to the Magistrate's Court of Balangoda in

relation to the allegation of sexual assault on 08.10.2015. The accused

sought anticipatory bail from the said Court on 04.01.2016 and it was

refused on 12.01.2016, after an inquiry. On 26.05.2016 the accused was

enlarged on bail by the Magistrate's Court and was thereafter remanded

by the High Court, upon service of indictment by the High Court, on

14.11.2019.

With her instant application to this Court, the petitioner seeks that

her husband be enlarged on bail.

The petitioner's bail application was resisted by the Hon. Attorney

General on the basis that there were no exceptional circumstances

warranting the accused to be enlarged on bail.

At the inquiry of the petitioner's application, learned Counsel for the

petitioner contended that the allegation under Section 8(1)(a) of the

4

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No.4

of 2015, could not be maintained since the accused had merely sought the

advice of an Attorney-at-Law, who, having decided the appropriate legal

remedy available to the accused had on his own sent out the Letters of

Demand, in view of the two year prescriptive period in relation to the

perceived cause of action of the accused.

Having emphasised that there was no physical or verbal threat of

violence that had originated from the accused in relation to the two

witnesses, learned Counsel contended that mere sending of Letters of

Demand, and thereby exercising his right to pursue a civil remedy In

relation to the allegation of sexual harassment, does not amount to a

"threat" as envisaged in the wording to the Section 8(1)(a) of the

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No.4

of 2015. Learned Counsel therefore moved this Court to consider that legal

position as an exceptional ground, in conjunction with the factual position

that there was no direct threat was made on any of the witnesses, either

verbally or physically, in favour of the accused.

Indeed, the position advanced by the learned Counsel for the

accused, is undoubtedly a unique and presents an interesting legal point to

be determined by a Court. However, it must also be noted that this

appears to be the accused's defence that he may advance to negate

imputation of criminal liability in the pending trial before the High Court.

If this Court were to indicate its mind, on the said question of law at this

stage that would have a significant effect on either the prosecution case,

S

,

which is yet to commence before the High Court or on the defence case, if

the trial Court rules that the accused had a case to answer. In the

circumstances, this Court is of the view that consideration of the said

contention is best left to the High Court, if advanced by the accused at the

appropriate stage.

But that does not dilute the unique factual and legal situation that

arose for consideration upon this submission. On one hand the

prosecution claims that the "threatening" its witness with Letters of

Demand were sufficient to impute criminal liability while on the other

hand, the accused maintains that he was merely exercising his entitlement

to seek relief against a false allegation that had been foisted on him. This

Court also notes that the accused was on bail, until the service of

indictment by the High Court. During this period, he was on bail, he did

not make any attempt to establish contact to any of the witnesses, either

directly or indirectly.

Given the unique nature of the circumstances, as revealed by the

petition of the accused as well as the objections filed by the Respondents,

and considered in its totality, this Court rules that the petitioner has

satisfied it of existence of exceptional circumstances, as per the statutory

requirement of Section 10 (l)(a) of the Assistance to and Protection of

Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No. 4 of 2015, to enlarge the accused

on bail.

6

Accordingly, this Court enlarges the accused on bail upon following

conditions;

a. the accused must furnish cash bail in a sum of Rs. 100,000.00,

b. the accused must present two sureties, who are acceptable to the

High Court and pledge Rs. One Million on surety bonds. They

must also be permanent residents of jurisdiction of the High

Court,

c. the accused must report to Officer-in-Charge of Women and

Child Abuse Prevention Bureau every last Sunday of each month,

d. the accused must present himself before the High Court during

the pendency of his trial,

e. the accused should not change his residential address without

informing the High Court,

f. the accused should not in any way interfere with the ongoing

prosecutions or of the witnesses.
