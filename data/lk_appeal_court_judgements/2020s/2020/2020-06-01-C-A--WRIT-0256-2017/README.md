Janak De Silva J.

At all times material to this application the Petitioner was a member and the Chairman of the

North Central Provincial Council (NCP Council). He assails his removal as the Chairman of the

NCP Council on the following grounds:

(a) The illegal and unlawful conduct of the 3rd Respondent in including a 'no confidence

motion' in violation of the established procedure of the rules of procedures code of the

NCP Council.

(b) The illegal and unlawful removal of the Petitioner from the post of Chairman of the NCP

Council in violation of the procedure established by law in terms of the Provincial

Council Act No. 42 of 1987 as amended (Provincial Council Act).

(c) The illegality and procedural impropriety in appointing the 6th Respondent as the

Chairman of the NCP Council.

(d) The illegality and unlawfulness of the 34th Respondent in appointing the 6th Respondent

in violation of legal procedures.

(e) The acts of one or more of the Respondents, in removing the Petitioner as the Chairman

of the NCP Council and the purported appointment of the 6th Respondent as the

Chairman is:

i. Illegal and unlawful,

ii. ultra vires the powers vested by the Provincial Council Act,

Page 8 of 14

iii. violative of the established legal provisions of the Rules of Procedure Code of the

NCP Council,

iv. arbitrary, capricious, exercised in excess of powers vested by the statute and

tainted with mala-fides and conducted for collateral purposes.

v. thus, void having no force or avail in law.

Limited Statement of Objections has been filed by the 3rd and 35th and the 6th Respondents

where two preliminary objections have been raised.

According to the Petitioner, section 41 of the Rules of Procedure Code sets out the rules and

procedures to be followed in the event of a 'no confidence motion' being brought against the

Chairman. In particular attention of Court is drawn to the fact that the Secretary of the NCP

Council is required to forward it to the Select Committee of the Council to decide whether it is

inconsistent with the Constitution, Provincial Council Act or the Rules of Procedure Code.

The Petitioner contends that on or about 06.06.2017 the members of the NCP Council

representing the opposition sought to bring a 'no confidence motion' against the Petitioner but

that the Select Committee of the NCP Council decided that it was inconsistent with the

Provincial Council Act and the Rules of Procedure Code.

It is further contended that later a second 'no confidence motion' was sought to be brought

against him on or about 06.07.2017 in breach of clause 41(1) (a) and (b) of the Rules of

Procedure Code and that the Select Committee of the NCP Council again dismissed this motion.

The Petitioner submits that thereafter when the Petitioner was conducting the Council meeting

on 18th July 2017, to his surprise and apprehension the 'no confidence motion' dismissed by the

Select Committee was unlawfully and illegally included in the agenda by the 3rd Respondent.

Since the 'no confidence motion' could not have been included in the agenda for the reasons

elaborated earlier, the Petitioner adjourned the meeting after taking up other matters.

According to the Petitioner thereafter the 5th to 15th Respondents illegally proceeded with the

meeting and took steps to remove the Petitioner from the post of Chairman, NCP Council.

Page 9 of 14

The 3rd and 35th and the 6th Respondents have raised two preliminary objections namely failure

to comply with Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 and that

the Petitioner has fraudulently suppressed and misrepresented material facts.

I will first consider the preliminary objection that the Petitioner has fraudulently suppressed

and misrepresented material facts.

It is established law that discretionary relief will be refused by Court without going into the

merits if there has been suppression and/or misrepresentation of material facts. It is necessary

in this context to refer to the following passage from the judgment of Pathirana J in W. S.

Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi [77 N.L.R. 131 at 135,6]:

The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed before the

Court when, an application for a writ or injunction, is made and the process of the Court

is invoked is laid down in the case of the King v. The General Commissioner for the

Purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmorbd

de Poigns. Although this case deals with a writ of prohibition the principles enunciated

are applicable to all cases of writs or injunctions. In this case a Divisional Court without

dealing with the merits of the case discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant

had suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to her application. The Court of

Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that there had been a suppression of

material facts by the applicant in her affidavit and therefore it was justified in refusing a

writ of prohibition without going into the merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous

is the necessity for a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the Court would

not go into the merits of the application, but will dismiss it without further examination".

This principle has been consistently applied by our courts in writ applications. [Hulangamuwa v.

Siriwardena [(1986) 1 Sri.L.R. 275], Collettes Ltd. v. Commissioner of Labour [(1989) 2 Sri.L.R. 6],

Laub v. Attorney General [(1995) 2 Sri.L.R. 88], Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd. v. Wilfred Van Els

[(1997) 1 Sri.L.R. 360], Jaysinghe v. The National Institute of Fisheries [(2002) 1 Sri.L.R. 277] and

Page 10 of 14

Lt. Commander Ruwan Pathirana v. Commodore Dharmasiriwardene& Others [(2007) 1 Sri.L.R.

24].

In fact, in Dahanayake and Others v. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. and Others [(2005) 1

Sri.L.R. 67]this Court held that if there is no full and truthful disclosure of all material facts, the

Court would not go into the merits of the application but will dismiss it without further

examination.

According to the Petitioner the first 'no confidence motion' was not approved by the Select

Committee of the NCP Council as it was inconsistent with the Provincial Council Act and the

Rules of Procedure Code [paragraph 15 of the petition]. In proof of this position two documents

X5 and X6 have been pleaded by the Petitioner. It appears that X5 is a copy of the 'no

confidence motion' at the bottom of which it is written in sinhala that the motion should not be

included in the agenda. The seal of the Petitioner has been placed below this note and signed

presumably by the Petitioner. Next to it the seal of the 3rd Respondent appears below an

indecipherable statement written in sinhala.

However, the 6th Respondent has with his limited statement of objections produced marked

6R1 the minutes of the Select Committee of the NCP Council held on 12.06.2017 signed by the

3rd Respondent. These minutes show that a majority of the Select Committee approved the

inclusion of the 'no confidence motion' in the agenda.

This fact has been suppressed and misrepresented to Court by the Petitioner. The Petitioner

contends that there is no suppression and misrepresentation of material fact and relies on the

decision in Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. and Others v. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd. [(1987) 1

Sri.L.R. 5] where it was held:

"To justify the dissolution of an injunction the suppression or misrepresentation should

be of "such a character as to present to court a case which was likely to procure the

injunction but which was in fact different from the case which really existed"

Page 11 of 14

Thus, a misstatement of the true facts by the plaintiff which put an entirely different

complexion on the case as presented by him when the injunction was applied for ex

parte would amount to a misrepresentation or suppression of material facts warranting

its dissolution without going into the merits".

One of the main grounds on which the Petitioner seeks to assail his removal as Chairman of the

NCP Council is that none of the 'no confidence motions" against him was approved to be placed

on the agenda by the Select Committee of the NCP Council. It is a material fact on which the

Petitioner has sought to mislead Court by suppressing and /or misrepresenting the true facts.

Hence this application is liable to be dismissed on that ground alone without going into the

merits.

There is further suppression and/or misrepresentation of material facts by the Petitioner. The

Petitioner claims that he was taken by surprise when the second 'no confidence motion' which

had been dismissed by the Select Committee of the NCP Council was included in the agenda by

the 3rd Respondent for the meeting on 18th July 2017 [paragraph 26 of the petition].

It is inconceivable how the Petitioner could have been surprised when he had previously

invoked the jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court of the North Central Province holden in

Anuradhapura in case no. 15/2017 (3R3) on 13.07.2017 seeking to prevent the said 'no

confidence motion' being taken up on 18.07.2017. According to paragraph 28 of the petition

filed in that case the Petitioner was clearly aware of the inclusion of the said motion in the

agenda for the meeting on 18.07.2017. This application was withdrawn on 17.07.2017 by the

Petitioner on what is stated to be technical grounds. The Petitioner has suppressed to this

Court the filing and withdrawal of that application.

It also appears to me that the Petitioner is guilty of suppression and/or misrepresenting

material facts by stating that even the second 'no confidence motion' was rejected by the

Select Committee. However, according to the minutes of the Select Committee meeting held on

10.07.2017 (6R5) a majority of the members had indicated that the 'no confidence motion'

should be included in the agenda for the next meeting.

Page 12 of 14

In this respect, I wish to advert to the decision in Moosajees Limited v. Eksath Engineru Saha

Samanya Kamkaru Samithiya [79(I) N.L.R. 285 at 288] where the Court held:

"The pleadings in their petition and affidavit do not contain a full disclosure of the real

facts of the case and to say the least the Petitioner has not observed the utmost good

faith and has been guilty of a lack of uberrima fides by a suppression of material facts in

the pleadings. It was neither fair by this court nor by his counsel that there was no full

disclosure of material facts."

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner adverted to the recent pronouncement of

the Supreme Court in Nobel Resources International Pvt. Limited v. Hon. Ranjith Siyambalapitiya

and Others [SC (F/R) 394/2015] where it was held:

"As it is essential to the maintenance of the rule of law that every organ of the State

must act within the limits of its power and carry out the duty imposed upon it in

accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the law, the Court cannot close

its eyes and allow the actions of the State pr public authority go unchecked in its

operations, in the public interest. If the Petitioner with a good case is turned away,

merely because he is not sufficiently affected or the Petitioner has no 'locus standii' to

maintain this application, that means that some Government Agency is left free to

violate the law and this is not only contrary to the public interest but also violates the

Rule of Law, the object of which is to protect the citizens from unlawful governmental

actions. It will be a travesty of justice if, having found as a fact that a fundamental right

has been infringed or is threatened to be infringed, the Court yet dismissed the

application on a preliminary objections raised by the Respondents." (Emphasis is of the

Petitioner)

I am in full agreement with this pronouncement. At the same time it is also a travesty of justice

to allow a litigant to plead his case on the merits before this Court in an application by judicial

review even where it is found that he has suppressed and/or misrepresented material facts to

Court.

Page 13 of 14

In Fonseka v. Lt. General Jagath Jayasuriya and Five Others [(2011) 2 Sri.L.R. 372] a divisional

bench of this Court held:

(1) A petitioner who seeks relief by writ which is an extra-ordinary remedy must in

fairness to Court, bare every material fact so that the discretion of Court is not wrongly

invoked or exercised.

(2) It is perfectly settled that a person who makes an ex parte application to Court is

under an obligation to make that fullest possible disclosure of all material facts within

his knowledge.

(3) If there is anything like deception the Court ought not to go in to the merits, but

simply say "we will not listen to your application because of what you have done.

The Rule of Law in its primary sense means that everything must be done according to law.

Permitting litigants to suppress and/or misrepresent material facts to Court, in order to obtain

relief runs contrary to this ideal. Justice according to Rule of Law must mean applying the law to

the true state of the facts.

In conclusion, I wish to advert to another matter. In terms of Article 140 of the Constitution this

Court must act according to law in deciding whether to issue writs of Certiorari and

Mandamus. This means English common law principles [Sirisena Cooray v. Tissa Dias

Bandaranayake (1999) 1 Sri. L. R. 1 at 14-15)].

English Courts have considered the conduct of the Petitioner in deciding whether to grant

discretionary relief by way of judicial review. A ratepayer was denied a remedy to quash a

refusal to make a refund of rates because of his previous deliberate and unjustifiable

withholding of rates owed [Dorot Properties Ltd. v. London Borough of Brent (1990) C.O.D. 378].

A local authority which pursued pointless litigation was denied any remedy [Windsor and

Maidenhead Royal BC v. Brandrose Investments Ltd. (1983) 1 W.L.R. 509]. A local council which

sought to challenge ministerial confirmation of its own proposals for re-organising schools,

relying on their own procedural error was denied relief [R. v. Secretary of State for Education

and Science ex. P. Birmingham City Council (1985) 83 L.G.R. 79].

Page 14 of 14

Our Courts have adopted this approach and withheld relief due to the unmeritorious conduct of

the Petitioner even where there has been a clear violation of natural justice [Wickremasinghe v.

Ceylon Electricity Board and Another (1982) 2 Sri.L.R. 607].

In terms of section 8(1) of the Provincial Councils Act, the Chairman shall not preside, although

it appears that he can be present, at any sitting of the Provincial Council while any resolution

for his removal is under consideration. This is exactly what the Petitioner did though he was

clearly aware that the 'no confidence motion' against him was in the agenda. The prohibition

appears to be an application of the rules of natural justice, in particularly nemo judex in causa

sua which has been breached by the Petitioner.

For all the foregoing reasons, I uphold the preliminary objection on suppression and/or

misrepresentation of material facts and refuse notice. The application is dismissed in limine. I

make no order as to costs.
