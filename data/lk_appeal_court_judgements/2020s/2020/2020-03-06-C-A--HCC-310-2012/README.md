ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal where the accused-appellant was convicted for

trafficking in and being in possession of DeacehJle Morphine, a prohibited

substance, contrary to Section 54A (b) and (d) of Poisons Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

Upon his conviction on both these counts, the accused-appellant was

imposed two terms of imprisonment for life as the appropriate sentence by the

trial Court.

In challenging validity of the conviction, the learned President's Counsel

who appeared for the accused-appellant, had broadly framed the ground of

appeal as the failure of the trial Court to appreciate the improbability of the

prosecution version of events. In addressing this Court in support of this ground,

learned President's Counsel had highlighted following factors, in his

2

.. . . , . ,

submissions which the trial Court should have considered and resolved in his

favour;

a. the considerable disparity in the distance in conducting this detection

as described by the prosecution witnesses and the reading of the

odometer,

b. the inconsistency of the evidence of the detecting officer that he

identified Heroin in all 7 small parcels whereas the Government

Analyst had only identified Heroin in six of the seven parcels,

c. the failure of the prosecution to prove the inward chain of production,

d. the finding of the trial Court that the version of events as spoken to by

the accused-appellant could neither be rejected nor accepted and its

failure to afford the resultant benefit of the intermediate position in

favour of the accused-appellant.

It is helpful, therefore to have a brief overview of the respective cases

that were presented by the prosecution as well as the accused-appellant at the

outset, in view of the above stated reasons and in order to fully appreciate the

factual positions that had been relied upon by him in support since they are

based on determination of certain facts by the trial Court.

The prosecution presented its version of events, leading to the detection of

the prohibited substance in the possession of the accused-appellant, primarily

through the Detection Officers IP Nalaka Prabashwara and 51 Warnapriya who

assisted him in the detection. Both of these officers attached to Police Narcotics

Bureau at that time. The detection of Heroin on 25.05.2006 being in possession of

the accused- appellant, was made upon information received by PS 27391 Rajitha

3

.. . .

through one of his private informants that a transaction of a prohibited drug

was to take place in Peliyagoda area and if the officers of PNB could come near

Nawaloka Hotel of Peliyagoda, the offender could be pointed out. PS Rajitha had

entered this information in his Pocket Note Book. Having verified the entry

made by PS Rajitha, IP Nalaka had mobilised a team of officers to carry out the

detection.

The team had left PNB 4.40 p.m. after making an out entry and arrived at

Nawaloka Hotel at about 5.30 p.m. along the route of Kochchikade, lnguru Kade

Junction and Peliyagoda where IP Nalaka, PSs Rajitha and Wimalaratne had met

the informant for a brief discussion. The informant was directed to proceed to a

place near CargiIIs Food City of Peliyagoda, where he informed the Police party

that the transaction of illicit drugs was to take place. The team had parked their

vehicle in the car park of the super market and waited for the three wheeler of

the suspected drug peddler to arrive. A three wheeler had turned into the said

car park from the opposite direction and the informant had pointed out the said

three wheeler.

IP Nalaka had then got off the van along with PS Rajitha and PS

Wimalaratne and walked up to the three wheeler. He noted that the driver of the

vehicle too had noted and appeared alarmed by their arrival. The officers had

thereafter run towards the three wheeler as its driver was attempting to start its

engine. Rajitha and Wimalaratne had held onto the accused-appeIIant who then

threw out a green coloured parcel, which feII by the side of the road, having hit

on the side of the three wheeler.

Having secured the accused-appeIIant with a pair of handcuffs, IP Nalaka

then examined the contents of the green coloured bag. He found 7 yellowish

4

, . . .

bags of cellophane containing a brown substance which he identified as Heroin.

The accused-appellant was formally arrested at 6.25 p.m. for possession of

Heroin.

The Police party had thereafter decided to conduct a search and the

accused-appellant had led the team of officers to his residence, located at 312/68,

Madampitiya Road, Colombo 14. The search yielded nothing and the party had

returned to PNB office along the route of Aluth Mawatha, Kochchikade and Colombo

Fort. After the detection of Heroin, IP Nalaka had kept the parcel of heroin in his

possession until it was properly handed over to the reservist at the PNB, having

completed the sealing process.

The prosecution had called Rajitha as its 2nd prosecution witness in

support of the evidence of the detecting officer IP Nalaka . The prosecution also

called IP Gunasekara who was the reservist when this detection was made and

Ms. Chandrani of the Government Analyst Department.

When the trial Court called for the defence, the accused-appellant made a

statement from the dock claiming that the parcel containing Heroin was

introduced to him by the officers of PNB at its Headquarters and he was arrested

near Oliyamulla Culvart in Wattala and not at Peliyagoda as the prosecution

claims. He also called Mirissa Gedarage Wijesiri in support of his claim of arrest at

Oliyamulla, an officer from the Department of Motor Traffic in relation of vehicle

bearing No. HD 2726, Registrar of High Court of Gampaha in relation to case

No. 5809, which was pending before that Court where one Samarasinghe Mudalige

Krishantha Lalith was indicted for multiple counts of possession and trafficking in

of different quantities of Heroin on 26.12.2006.

5

In support of the ground of appeal that had been raised on the

improbability of the prosecution case, learned President's Counsel submitted

that the considerable disparity in the distance in conducting this detection as

described by the prosecution witnesses and the reading of the odometer is clearly

indicative of distortion of facts by the prosecution witnesses and therefore

supports the claim of the accused-appellant that he was arrested elsewhere, a fact

supported by the Defence Witness Wijesiri. It was admitted by the prosecution

witnesses during cross-examination that the route they have taken to reach

Cargills Food City at Peliyagoda and to return back to PNB would be less than

five kilometres, whereas the odometer readings as reflected in the notes indicate

that the vehicle had travelled a total distance of 24 kilometres.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in his reply contended that the witness

had merely entered the readings of the odometer as he was told by the driver of

the vehicle in making these entries and therefore the witness is unable to vouch

for its accuracy.

When the relevant segment of the cross-examination is examined, it is

apparent that the witness was questioned as to the distance they had travelled

from Nawaloka Hotel to Cargills Food City at Peliyagoda. The witness had replied

that he is unable to answer the question since he had not made any notes and

unable to estimate the distance with his memory. In continuing the same line of

cross-examination, the accused-appellant pressed the witness for an answer

suggesting that it is less than 5 or 6 km. When the officers have left their office,

the odometer reading was 22488 and when they returned, it read 224812,

indicating they had covered a distance of 24 km in total. Then the witness was

only suggested that they had travelled more than what they have declared and

hence the disparity. This suggestion was rejected by the witness. 6

.

When the evidence is considered in its proper context, there is no clear

evidence as to the total distance from the PNB office to the place of detection. In

addition, the officers have visited the residence of the accused-appellant to

conduct a search. This fact was not challenged by the accused-appellant. In re-

examination, the witness clarified that the total distance of 24 km includes the 2

to 2 12 km distance they had travelled to conduct the search. There is clear

evidence that they have travelled from the PNB office to the place of detection

and then to the residence of the accused- appellant at Madampitiya Road and

returned back to the PNB. Therefore, there is no improbability of the prosecution

version of events in this respect which had the effect of rendering the same a

highly improbable one, which no Court can place reliance on.

It was also the submission of the learned President's Counsel that the

inconsistency of the evidence of the detecting officer that he pOSitively identified

Heroin in all 7 small parcels and the Government Analyst who had identified

Heroin only in six of the seven parcels, creates a doubt as to the integrity of the

productions, when coupled with the fact that the prosecution's failure to call

Wimalaratne who assisted IP Nalaka in sealing them at the PNB. He also

contended that the prosecution had failed to prove the inward chain of

production.

This contention by the learned President's Counsel needed to be

considered in the light of the evidence of IP Nalaka and PS Rajitha in relation to

identification of Heroin and the sealing of productions.

It is the evidence of IP Nalaka that no sooner he had picked up the parcel thrown

out by the accused-appellant and examined its contents. There were seven

packets in it. It is his evidence that he identified Heroin in them by its smell and

7

upon his experience in such detections. Having returned to PNB, just before the

sealing, he decided to conduct a field test and had therefore pricked the "parcel"

he had recovered from the accused-appellant with a probe, on which he applied

the field test. The test showed a positive result.

During cross-examination, he admitted that he had applied "Marquis

Test" by pricking each parcel using a paper pin as a probe and then immersing

the probe in the test tube containing the testing chemical. He asserted that he

conducted tests on all seven packets and all of them tested positive for Heroin.

However, Rajitha in his evidence stated that Nalaka used the same probe in

pricking the seven packets, although he tested them separately. Whilst giving

evidence before the trial Court, IP Nalaka also noted that one of the packets had

its original colour in its contents even at that point of time while the other six had

changed its colour into a darker hue.

Government Analyst, in her evidence stated she had examined seven

packets containing a brown coloured powder. Having analysed their contents, it

was clear that, of these seven packets, she did not identify Heroin in one of the

packets, marked as "POT'.

Learned President's Counsel utilises this seemingly inconsistent factual

position of Nalaka and Government Analyst, in support of his contention that the

prosecution version in relation to the detection of Heroin is an improbable one.

Marquis test is a test used by law enforcement agencies throughout the

world to conduct on the spot tests in identifying prohibited drugs. It is only a

basic test to identify whether the suspected substance had any Heroin in it. The

witnesses have correctly referred to as the "field test". The "field test" that was

conducted by IP Nalaka on the seven packets recovered from the accused-

8

appellant was done only after returning to PNB. By this time, he had initially

founded his reasonable suspicion that the brown powder contained Heroin,

upon its smell and his work experience. The field test therefore is meant only to

confirm his suspicion that the brown powder contained Heroin.

The very purpose of conducting field tests had to be clearly distinguished

from the more formal scientific analysis conducted by the officers of the

Government Analyst Department who possess the required knowledge in the

science of Chemistry and the expertise to carry out the required chemical

analytical tests to identify and quantify the presence and concentration of a

prohibited substances from a sample of suspected production item. The

acceptance by IP Nalaka of having identified Heroin in all seven packets during

cross-examination will have to be considered in this context. His objective was to

have his suspicions justified by conducting a field test on the parcel containing

packets of brown powder suspected to contain Heroin.

It is undisputable that the accusation of possession and trafficking of

Heroin against the accused-appellant is based on the report of the Government

Analyst. In that context, irrespective of the fact whether Heroin was identified

during field test or not, the decisive factor is the confirmation of the presence of

Heroin in the parcel recovered from the accused-appellant by the Government

Analyst. In evaluating relative probabilities of the version of events as spoken to

by the Prosecution witnesses, the trial Court had to be mindful whether the

initial suspicion of the detecting officer is justified in view of the results obtained

through a more formal analysis of the production by the Government Analyst at

a subsequent stage.

9

.

In this particular instance, the issue under consideration is whether the

non-identification of Heroin in P07 by the Government Analyst, when the same

packet was tested positive for Heroin detecting officer who conducted the field

test on it creates a doubt in the integrity of the productions or as to the

testimonial trustworthiness of the evidence of the detecting officer.

Whether the integrity of the production was compromised or not could be

tested by other more accurate evidence.

The evidence of the prosecution is, after having conducted a successful

detection, the officers have returned to PNB with the production in the

possession of the detecting officer. Whilst at the PNB, the sealing of the detected

heroin was done by IP Nalaka with the assistance of Wimalaratne. The parcel was

pricked with a paper pin and tested with chemicals which indicated positive for

Heroin. Each packet of Heroin weighed 100 grams. The 7 cellophane parcels

were placed in a transparent polythene cover along with an identification tag

with the witness's and the accused-appellant's signatures and the date of

detection. This polythene cover was sealed and was then placed inside a brown

coloured large envelop and was sealed with the witness's personal seal and

finger prints of the accused- appellant. This brown envelop was marked as "J1".

The green bag, in which the seven packets were originally found, was also

placed inside another transparent polythene bag with a similar identification tag.

The polythene bag was then put inside of a long brown envelop and sealed with

the marking "J2" placed on it.

Both these parcels were entered in the Productions Register under PR 33.

During the trial, a properly sealed parcel was opened in the well of Court.

The outer brown coloured wrapping paper with seals placed by the Government 10

.

Analyst was marked P4. Inside the parcel, another parcel wrapped in a brown

coloured was found and it was marked P5. P5 parcel had the description of M.e.

Colombo case No. B 2861/06 with the relevant Information Book references and

as containing seven packets each of which containing 100 grams of heroin. The

said P5 cover was identified by IP Nalaka as the "J1"parcel. There was another

polythene bag was found in P5, which contained an identification tag. The

witness had identified them as the polythene bag he used to put in the 7 packets

of heroin and the identification tag. These were marked P6A and P6 respectively.

IP Nalaka also clarified the 7 packets were in fact had two bags in each of the

packets and although there were 7 packets but in total they contained 14

individual bags.

When questioned as to how he identified the seven bags of heroin, the

witness replied out of the 7 packets, he had found that only one of them

remained in its original colour as seen at the time of detection, when examined in

Court. The contents of other 6 packets had turned itself into a substance of

darker colour.

This indicates that there was cogent evidence before the trial Court to

satisfy itself that the productions that had been recovered from the accused-

appellant are the ones that were analysed by the Government Analyst who

identified and quantified Heroin contained in it. When the evidence is taken as a

whole, the mere fact that Heroin was not identified in P07 would not create a

reasonable doubt as to the integrity of productions in reaching Government

Analyst for analysis. The trial Court was alive to this issue and held that no

reasonable doubt exists on this claim. The failure to call witness Wimalaratne

had no significant effect, as there were sufficient cogent evidence as to the

integrity of the production.

11

.. . .

In this regard, this Court notes with regret the manner in which the

evidence of the detecting officer is presented by the learned prosecutor before the

trial Court. It appears that the prosecutor was blissfully unaware as to the

conflict that exists in the detecting officer's find of Heroin in all seven packets

and the Analyst's finding that only six of them contained Heroin. When the

accused-appellant cross-examined both the detecting officer and the one who

assisted over the performance of a field test on all seven packets, no alarm bell

rang in the mind of the learned prosecutor even to offer a clarification during re-

examination of these witnesses.

When this appeal was argued, learned President's Counsel and learned

Deputy Solicitor General had to labour in order to sieve through the apparent

inconsistentcies among the evidence of the detecting officer and the description

of the productions given by the learned prosecutor when the sealed parcels were

unsealed and opened in the well of the trial Court in support of their respective

positions. The Counsel before this Court had to struggle to present their

respective submissions simply due to the incoherent manner of leading evidence.

The obvious errors in the proceedings too were not corrected. It is strongly

suggested that the prosecutions are undertaken after a proper appreciation of the

role of a prosecutor, especially in a drug detection.

This Court, in considering the issue whether the said inconsistency creates

a reasonable doubt as to the testimonial trustworthiness of the evidence of the

detecting officer, must observe that the way IP Nalaka had conducted the field

test is not clearly elicited in his examination in chief. There is evidence that he

had used the same probing instrument in taking samples from all seven packets

before he inserted it in the chemical agent in order to perform the test for

presence of Heroin. The results of the field test, being only an aid in 12

.. . .

investigations, is primarily for the detecting officer to decide whether there are

reasonable grounds available for him to suspect that an offence was committed

by the suspect he had arrested with the questionable item of production. It

appears that IP Nalaka verily believed that the all seven packets contained

Heroin, while this belief was challenged by the more precise findings of the

Government Analyst. But that was a finding made subsequently. In these

circumstances, the mere inconsistency that exists with the evidence of IP Nalaka

and the Government Analyst cannot be a basis to cast aspersions on the

credibility of the detecting officer, who had no control over the contents of the

composition of the substance he had detected and its improbable for him to say

that all 7 packets contained Heroin when only six packets had Heroin in them.

It is interesting to note that out of the 7 packets, "PI" and "P4" weighed

100.1 grams as its gross weight, per the evidence of Government Analyst. But

after analysis, it was found that packet "PI" contained 29.2 grams of pure

Heroin, while "P4" contained a higher value of 31.1 grams of pure Heroin. One

expects to find the purity of the seven packets to reflect a same figure as it is

reasonable to assume that they may have been packed from the same principle

stock of brown powder. Yet these differences did exist, and that fact alone cannot

challenge the trustworthiness of the assertion that they were detected in one and

the same parcel. Therefore, the inconsistent findings of the field test with the

findings of the Government Analyst cannot pose a challenge to the testimonial

trustworthiness of the detecting officer.

Lastly, this Court must deal with the contention of the learned President's

Counsel that the finding of the trial Court over the version of events as spoken to

by the accused-appellant could neither be rejected nor accepted and its

13

. .

subsequent failure to afford the resultant benefit of the intermediate position, in

favour of the accused-appellant.

This contention was made by the accused-appellant by placing reliance of

the very wording used by the trial Court, in its judgment. The relevant part of

the judgment is accurately reproduced below ;-

"@S q-:!lC) 5citSlOloz <;tl\C)1ll OlOzf'll if) qlOlO@Cro

8@C3lz6'\ Ol@ @llllCOziii wC) oC)coro OlO~."

This statement appears in page 17 of the 20-page judgment of the trial

Court. When the structure and presentation of the judgment is considered it

appears that the trial Court had commenced dealing with the case presented by

the accused-appellant from page 14 with the opening statement that the trial

Court would consider the evidence adduced by defence through a dock

statement to determine whether it results in creating a reasonable doubt about

the prosecution's case. Then the Court continues to consider the positions

advanced by the accused-appellant during his cross-examination of prosecution

witnesses and the statement from the dock. In dealing with the 24 km issue and

the alleged suppression of the place of arrest only the trial Court had made the

above observation. Then the trial Court continued with the analysis of defence

case including its witnesses and finally reaches its conclusion on the acceptability

of the defence case at page 19, the penultimate page of the judgment, the trial

Court had rejected the case presented by the accused- appellant totally.

When the manner of the trial Court in considering the defence case is

considered in its entirety, the isolated reference relied upon by the accused-

appellant is indicative of the fact that the Court was not in a position to accept

nor reject his evidence, seemed an unfounded proposition, especially in view of

14

.. , .

its more explicit finding on the defence case at the concluding stage of the

judgment.

Therefore, in view of the reasoning contained in the preceding paragraphs,

this Court is of the view that there is no merit in the appeal of the accused-

appellant and his appeal ought to be dismissed.

Accordingly, the conviction of the accused-appellant as entered by the trial

Court is hereby affirmed. Since the accused-appellant was imposed life sentences

and not the death sentences, there is no need to seek the submissions of the

accused-appellant on sentence. The sentences that are imposed on the accused-

appellant by the trial Court too are affirmed in the circumstances.
