Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Dharmaraja College, Kandy, is a premier Buddhist school

founded as far back as in 1887, under the leadership of Colonel

Henry Steel Olcott. Two of its historical buildings are Banbury

building, constructed in 1898, and Bilimoria hall in 1915.

By Gazette marked P6/1R1 issued in 1962, the said two

buildings, together with the appurtenant land, were vested in

the Crown. This was done under section 4 of the Assisted

Schools and Training Colleges (Supplementary Provisions) Act,

No.8 of 1961. Section 4(1) thereof reads as follows:

Where the Minister considers it desirable to do so, the

Minister may, by Order published in the Gazette (in this Act

referred to as a Vesting Order), declare that, with effect

from such date as shall be specified in the Order (not being

a date earlier than fourteen days after the date of such

4

publication), all property of the description specified in the

Order, being property liable to vesting, shall vest in the

Crown.

The Assisted Schools and Training Colleges (Supplementary

Provisions) Act was passed to give teeth to its precursorthe

Assisted Schools and Training Colleges (Special Provisions) Act,

No. 5 of 1960.

The Vesting Order published in the Gazette proves that at the

time of vesting, the said buildings were in use by Dharmaraja

College Primary School. The Vesting Order reads as follows:

ASSISTED SCHOOLS AND TRAINING COLLEGES

(SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS) ACT, NO.8 OF 1961

Vesting Order No.164 A

K/DHARMARAJA COLLEGE PRIMARY SCHOOL, KANDY

BY virtue of the powers vested in me by section 4 of the

specified in the schedule appended hereto, being property

liable to vesting, shall vest in the Crown.

It is important to bear in mind that the cumulative effort in

introducing the above two Acts was not to destroy the Assisted

Schools in operation, but to revive and manage those schools in

a more efficient manner.

There is no dispute that the said two buildings were right

throughout in the custody of the 9th Respondent, the Principal of

Dharmaraja College, and the keys of the said buildings were

with him. Admittedly, in 1993, the Principal handed over the

keys of the two buildings to the 2nd Respondent, the Central

Cultural Fund, for renovation and repairs.1 After the renovation,

the 2nd Respondent, instead of handing over the keys to the

person from whom they were taken, handed them over to a third

party, the 3rd Respondent, the Basnayake Nilame of Natha

Devalaya.

In summary, the Petitioners filed this application before this

Court to recover the said two buildings for Dharmaraja College.

The 2nd Respondent in paragraph 15 of its statement of

objections states as there was a necessity to renovate and

reconstruct the buildings in dispute the keys to the said buildings

were handed over by the 9th Respondent to the 2nd Respondent

and on completion of the said renovations the 2nd Respondent

handed over the keys to the 3rd Respondent [Basnayake Nilame of

Natha Devalaya] in view of a directive issued by the President as

set out in the letter issued by the Commissioner of Buddhist

Affairs [marked 2R1].2

1 Vide P8. 2 Vide also 1R2.

7

The 2nd Respondent also tendered a letter marked 2R2, whereby

the Director General of the 2nd Respondent has explained to the

3rd Respondent the mistake made by the 2nd Respondent in

handing over the keys of the two buildings to the 3rd Respondent

after the repairs, and requesting the 3rd Respondent to hand

over the keys to the 2nd Respondent.

The President referred to in 2R1 and 1R2 is no longer among the

living. No scrap of paper issued under the hand and/or seal of

the President or by any officer of the Presidents Office has been

tendered. Hence, without any proof whatsoever, this Court

cannot accept the position of the 2nd Respondent that the

handing over of keys to the 3rd Respondent was done upon a

directive of the President. Such an irresponsible statement can

easily be made as an excuse for an ex facie illegal act.

Although the 2nd Respondent filed a statement of objections to

the application of the Petitioners, the 2nd Respondent did not

participate at the argument. Learned State Counsel stated she

had no instructions to appear for the 2nd Respondent.

In any event, the President could not have directed the 2nd

Respondent to hand over the keys to the 3rd Respondent, in

grave violation of the Public Trust doctrine.

In Sugathapala Mendis v. Chandrika Kumaratunga,3 the

Supreme Court held:

The principle that those charged with upholding the

Constitution - be it a police officer of the lowest rank or the

President - are to do so in a way that does not violate the

3 [2008] 2 Sri LR 339 at 352.

8

Doctrine of Public Trust by state action/inaction is a basic

tenet of the Constitution which upholds the legitimacy of

Government and the Sovereignty of the People. The Public

Trust Doctrine is based on the concept that the powers

held by organs of government are, in fact, powers that

originate with the People, and are entrusted to the

Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary only as a

means of exercising governance and with the sole objective

that such powers will be exercised in good faith for the

benefit of the People of Sri Lanka. Public power is not for

personal gain or favour, but always to be used to optimize

the benefit of the People. To do otherwise would be to

betray the trust reposed by the People within whom, in

terms of the Constitution, the Sovereignty reposes. Power

exercised contrary to the Public Trust Doctrine would be an

abuse of such power and in contravention of the Rule of

Law. This Court has long recognized and applied the Public

Trust Doctrine, establishing that the exercise of such

powers is subject to judicial review (Vide De Silva v.

Atukorale [1993] 1 Sri LR 283, 296-297, Jayawardane v

Wijayatilake [2001] 1 Sri LR 132, 149, 159.

The Supreme Court further stated that State officials are not

bound to follow wrong directives, even by the Head of State.

[B]eing a creature of the Constitution, the Presidents

powers in effecting action of the Government or of state

officers is also necessarily limited to effecting action by

them that accords with the Constitution. In other words, the

President does not have the power to shield, protect or

coerce the action of state officials or agencies, when such

9

action is against the tenets of the Constitution or the Public

Trust, and any attempts on the part of the President to do

so should not be followed by the officials for doing so will (i)

result in their own accountability under the Public Trust

Doctrine, betraying the trust of good governance reposed in

them under the Constitution by the People of this nation, in

whom sovereignty reposes and (ii) render them sycophants

unfit to uphold the dignity of public office.4

The two buildings in question have been admittedly constructed

by Dharmaraja College, not by the Natha Devalaya.

The question of title to the land on which these two buildings are

standing cannot be the subject matter of this writ application.

The 3rd Respondents whole claim before this Court is based on

alleged ownership of the land, which is disputed by the

Petitioners who counter claim ownership to the same. This is

not a land case or a rei vindicatio action. The question of title

shall be solved, if so advised, in a separate action. Hence no

relief can be granted to the 3rd Respondent.

According to section 6 of the Assisted Schools and Training

Colleges (Supplementary Provisions) Act, a Vesting Order shall

have the effect of vesting the property in the Crown, free from all

encumbrances. Therefore, the 3rd Respondent can have no

claim to ownership.

Under section 10 of the same Act, a Divesting Order can be

made. That has not been done in this case. Section 10(1) reads

as follows:

4 Ibid at 374-375.

10

Notwithstanding that any property used for the purpose of any

school to which this Act applies has vested in the Crown by

virtue of a Vesting Order, the Minister, by subsequent Order

published in the Gazette (in this Act referred to as a Divesting

Order)

(a) shall, if such property ceases to be used, or is not

needed for the purpose of a school conducted and

maintained by the Director for and on behalf of the

Crown, revoke that Vesting Order in so far as it relates

to such property with effect from the date on which such

property so ceased to be used or was not so needed; or

(b) shall, if the Director ceases to be manager of that school

by virtue of the operation of any Order made under the

principal Act, revoke that Vesting Order with effect from

the date on which the Director so ceased to be the

manager; or

(c) shall, if a determination is made on a reference to

arbitration under this Act that any property in respect of

which that Vesting Order was made is not property

liable to vesting, revoke that Vesting Order in so far as it

relates to such property with effect from the date on

which that Vesting Order took effect.

In the event a Divesting Order is made, learned Counsel for the

3rd Respondent was heard to say in his submissions that the

land shall pass to the true owner. That is incorrect. Section

10(2) states:

Where a Vesting Order in respect of any property is revoked

by a Divesting Order in whole or in part, the property in

11

respect of which the Divesting Order is made shall be

deemed never to have vested in the Crown by virtue of that

Vesting Order, and any question which might arise as to

any right, title or interest in or over that property shall be

determined accordingly.

This means, the land with the buildings on it shall pass to

Dharmaraja College for the reason that when the Vesting Order

was made the said land was in the control of Dharmaraja

College. In other words, if there was no Vesting Order,

Dharmaraja College would have been using the buildings as

before without any intervention from the Minister of Education

or the Natha Devalaya.

The Petitioners in the prayer to the petition sought to compel the

8th Respondent, the Minister of Education, to make a Divesting

Order by way of a writ of mandamus.

However, having considered the position taken by the 1st, 6th, 7th

and 8th Respondents in inter alia paragraphs 21 and 34 of their

joint statement of objections, learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioners informed the Court that the Petitioners do not wish

to pursue that relief.

By paragraph 21 of the said statement of objections, the

Respondents state as the aforesaid buildings are necessary for

the use of Dharmaraja College, steps cannot be taken to revoke

the vesting order in favour of the 1st Petitioner.

By paragraph 34 of the statement of objections, they say the

buildings in dispute are necessary for the use of the school as

there is a limitation on the space that is currently available for the

use of the school and these Respondents are opposed to any

12

decision to divest the said land and buildings to the Petitioners as

there is an urgent requirement for the same by the school.

Several letters have been sent both to the 2nd Respondent and

3rd Respondent to hand over the keys of the said buildings to

Dharmaraja College, but to no avail.5

The Attorney-General has directed the 1st Respondent, the

Secretary to the Ministry of Education, to communicate with the

4th Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Kandy, to take

possession of the said buildings under the State Lands (Recovery

of Possession) Act, No. 7 of 1979.6 Despite repeated requests,

the 4th Respondent has refused to take steps under the said Act,

without affording any reason why he is unable to carry out the

directive of the Attorney-General.7

Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent submits that the

Petitioners have no locus standi to file this application. I cannot

agree. High technical objections regarding locus standi have no

place in modern administrative law. A writ application can be

filed by any person, as defined in section 2(s) of the

Interpretation Ordinance, who has sufficient interest in the

matter, notwithstanding a lack of personal interest because of

the element of public interest involved in the subject matter of

controversy. The Petitioner in such an application can even be a

stranger. If the Petitioner comes to Court genuinely, as a public-

spirited citizen concerned to see that the law is obeyed in the

interest of all, his application shall be entertained. (Vide Lanka

Sugathapala Mendis v. Chandrika Kumaratunga.14)

In Wijesiri v. Siriwardene (supra) the Supreme Court stated:15

In this connection it would be relevant to refer to the views

of an eminent jurist on the question of locus standi. Soon

after the decision of the Privy Council in Durayappah Vs.

Fernando (1967) 3 WLR 289, in an Article entitled Unlawful

Administrative Action in (1967) 83 L.O.R. 499, H. W. R.

Wade expressed the view that one of the merits of Certiorari

is that it is not subject to narrow rules about locus standi,

but is available even to strangers, as the Courts have often

held, because of the element of public interest. In other

words it is a genuine remedy of public law, and all the more

valuable for that reason (at p. 504). As regards the

applications for Mandamus they should, in his view, in

principle be no more exacting than it is in the case of the

other prerogative remedies, because public authorities

should be compellable to perform their duties, as a matter

of public interest at the instance of any person genuinely

concerned; and in suitable case, subject always to

discretion, the Court should be able to award the remedy on

the application of a public spirited citizen who has no other

9 [1982] 1 Sri LR 171. 10 [2006] 1 Sri LR 83. 11 [2003] 3 Sri LR 146. 12 [1991] 1 Sri LR 333. 13 [2009] BLR 41. 14 [2008] 2 Sri LR 339 at 352. 15 At 175.

14

interest than a due regard for the observance of the

law-Wade-Administrative Law (4th Ed) 608. The result of a

restrictive doctrine of standing, therefore, would be to

encourage the government to break the law; yet this is

exactly what the prerogative writs should be able to prevent

(p. 609). To restrict Mandamus to cases of personal legal

right would in effect make it a private law remedy (p 610).

These observations, with which I am in respectful

agreement, appear to make the second requirement,

insisted upon by Tambiah J. i.e.: some personal interest in

the matter complained of, unnecessary. But the first

requirement ought, in my view, to be satisfied and it is

satisfied if the applicant can show a genuine interest in the

matter complained of, and that he comes before Court as a

public-spirited citizen concerned to see that the law is

obeyed in the interest of all, and not merely as a busy body

perhaps with a view to gain cheap publicity. As to whether

an applicant satisfies this second requirement will depend

on the facts of each case. (emphasis added)

For the aforesaid reasons, I hold:

(a) after the renovations, the handing over of the keys of

the two buildings by the 2nd Respondent to the 3rd

Respondent is illegal, and therefore that decision is

liable to be quashed by way of certiorari; and

(b) the refusal or reluctance on the part of the 4th

Respondent to take steps to evict the 3rd Respondent

from the premises under the provisions of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is unjustifiable, and

15

therefore the former shall be compelled to do so by way

of mandamus.

I grant the Petitioner the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (d)

and (e) of the prayer to the petition.

I make no order as to costs.

Before I part with this Judgment, let me add one more thing.

Learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent submitted that the

Court cannot grant the relief in paragraph (e) of the prayer to the

petition, as it requires the 4th Respondent to hand over the

buildings to the 1st Petitioner or to the 9th Respondent once

possession is taken over. According to the 3rd Respondent, the

4th Respondent cannot be compelled to hand over the buildings

to the 1st Petitioner or to the 9th Respondent. I am not inclined

to agree with this submission in view of the admission made by

the 1st, 6th, 7th and 8th Respondents inter alia in paragraphs 21

and 34 of their joint statement of objections, which I have

quoted above.
