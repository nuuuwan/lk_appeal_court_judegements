4th and 6th Respondents at Mihikatha Medura, Land Secretariat, 1200/6, Rajamalwatta Lane, Battaramulla. RESPONDENTS Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Asthika Devendra with Milindu Sarathchandra and Wasantha Sandaruwan for the Petitioner Ms. Madhubashini Sri Meththa, State Counsel for the 2nd 6th Respondents Argued on: 7th August 2020 Written Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 3rd July 2019 and Submissions: 4th September 2020 Tendered on behalf of the 2nd 6th Respondents on 12th September 2019 Decided on: 23rd October 2020 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.

The Petitioner states that the State had issued Pahingamuwa Arachchilage

Mudiyanse (hereinafter referred to as Mudiyanse) a permit in 1961 in respect of a

paddy land in extent of 3A 3R 28P. In January 1982, the State has issued Mudiyanse,

a Grant in terms of Section 19(4) read together with Section 19(6) of the Land

Development Ordinance (the Ordinance) in respect of the said paddy land.1

Mudiyanse had nominated his wife, Dewatawatte Ralalage Biso Menike (hereinafter

referred to as Biso Menike) as his successor for the said paddy land. Biso Menike in

turn had nominated her daughter and son, the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent,

respectively, as her successors. There is no dispute with regard to the succession to

the paddy land.

1 A copy of the said Grant has been marked P3.

3

At the same time that the aforementioned permit was issued in respect of the paddy

land, the State had issued Mudiyanse a permit in respect of a high land in extent of

3R 28P. In November 1992, the State had issued Mudiyanse a Grant in terms of

Section 19(4) read together with Section 19(6) of the Ordinance in respect of the said

high land. A copy of the said Grant has been produced by the Petitioner, marked P4.

It is admitted that at the time of the death of Mudiyanse in October 1993, there was

no nomination of a successor in respect of the high land. As a result, his wife, Biso

Menike had succeeded to the high land as a life interest holder, which has been

registered in the Register marked P8.

Biso Menike passed away in September 2006. In the absence of a nomination of a

successor by Mudiyanse, the issue as to who should succeed to the high land had to

be decided in terms of Section 72 of the Ordinance, read together with the Third

Schedule thereof.2 The contenders for succession were the Petitioner, who was living

on the said high land, the 5th Respondent and the 1st Respondent, who was living in

Medirigiriya. The 2nd Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Lankapura, by a certificate

issued in April 2014 marked P13 has recognized the 1st Respondent as the successor

of Mudiyanse on the basis that the 1st Respondent is the eldest son of Mudiyanse. As

a result, the name of the 1st Respondent has been entered in the Register marked

P14.

Dissatisfied with the said decision in P13 and P14, the Petitioner filed this

application in January 2016. By an amended petition filed on 2nd February 2016, the

Petitioner has sought inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision to recognize the 1st Respondent as

the successor to the high land, as evidenced by P13 and P14;

2 Section 72 reads as follows: If no successor has been nominated, or if the nominated successor fails to succeed, or if the nomination of a successor contravenes the provisions of this Ordinance, the title to the land alienated on a permit to a permit-holder who at the time of his or her death was paying an annual installment by virtue of the provisions of section 19 or to the holding of an owner shall, upon the death of such permit-holder or owner without leaving behind his or her spouse, or, where such permit-holder or owner died leaving behind his or her spouse upon the failure of such spouse to succeed to that land or holding, or upon the death of such spouse, devolve as prescribed in Rule 1 of the Third Schedule.

4

b) A Writ of Mandamus nominating the Petitioner as the successor to the said high

land;

c) A Writ of Mandamus (in the alternative) directing the 2nd - 4th and 6th

Respondents to hold an inquiry under the provisions of the Ordinance in order

to determine the successor to the said high land.

The 1st Respondent, having been issued notice of this application, appeared before

this Court and was represented by Counsel. However, a Statement of Objections has

not been filed on behalf of the 1st Respondent, the proxy given by the 1st Respondent

has been revoked, and the 1st Respondent has been absent and unrepresented

thereafter.

I shall commence by considering the case of the Petitioner. The Petitioner is claiming

that her mother, Biso Menike had contracted three marriages prior to entering into a

marriage of habit and repute with Mudiyanse. She claims that the 5th Respondent

and she are the only children of this marriage between Mudiyanse and Biso Menike,

which had only been registered in 1993, as evidenced by the marriage certificate

P5. The Petitioner states that the 5th Respondent is paralysed. Although the

Petitioner claims that her father is Mudiyanse, the birth certificate of the Petitioner

marked P1 issued in 1969, and the birth certificate of the 5th Respondent marked

P2 issued in 1965 does not contain any details with regard to their father. The name

of Mudiyanse as the father of the Petitioner (and the 5th Respondent) had been

inserted in P1 and P2 only in 1998, upon an application made to that effect by

Mudiyanse.3

The Petitioner claims that the 1st Respondent, who is older than the 5th Respondent

and herself, is a son of Biso Menike from a previous marriage. She states further that

Mudiyanse is not the father of the 1st Respondent, and that the 1st Respondent

admittedly does not have a birth certificate, to prove that Mudiyanse is the father.

The argument advanced on behalf of the Petitioner is that as the 1st Respondent is

not a blood relative of Mudiyanse, he has no right to succeed to the said high land in

terms of the Ordinance.4

3 Vide the entry placed on the reverse of P13 and P14 4 Vide the definition of relative in the Third Schedule.

5

As the 1st Respondent has not filed any objections, his position has to be considered

from the documents filed by the 2nd Respondent. It appears from letters written by

the 1st Respondent, which have been filed by the 2nd Respondent marked R7 and

R8, that the 1st Respondent is claiming that he is the eldest son of Mudiyanse. He is

claiming further that the Petitioner is a child of Biso Menike from a previous

marriage, and that the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent are not children of

Mudiyanse. However, as pointed out by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, there

are contradictions between the versions given by the 1st Respondent in the said

letters.

The land ledger pertaining to the permit in respect of the paddy land and the high

land has been produced together with the said permit marked R1. According to the

said ledger, the name of the 1st Respondent had initially been registered as the

successor of Mudiyanse. The Petitioner claims that this was done as Mudiyanse and

Biso Menike did not have children of their own at that time.

The name of the 1st Respondent has subsequently been struck off, and the name of

the 5th Respondent had been inserted as the nominated successor, at the request of

Mudiyanse by his letter dated 12th November 1979, marked R2, which reads as

follows:

hgy;a Ndjfhka b,a,d isgsus'

Mudiyanse had sent a similar letter marked R3, a few months later. In this letter,

Mudiyanse had mentioned that the State has allocated the 1st Respondent another

land.

6

As borne out by R4, at the request of Mudiyanse the nomination in favour of the 5th

Respondent too has been cancelled thereafter in favour of Biso Menike. In the

absence of a fresh nomination of a successor, the nomination registered in the said

ledger in favour of Biso Menike should apply to both the high land and the paddy

land. However, neither the Petitioner nor the 2nd Respondent is contending that Biso

Menike has been nominated as the successor to the high land, as well. In fact, the 3rd

Respondent, by his letter dated 7th December 1998 marked P6, has specifically

stated that the nomination of Biso Menike as successor is only with regard to the

paddy land, and that Biso Menike has only been recognised as a life holder of the

high land.

By letter dated 8th August 2013 marked R9, the 1st Respondent had informed the 3rd

Respondent as follows:

The dispute relating to the succession to the high land had been taken up at the

Even though the agreement reached at the mobile service was that the land will be

shared between the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent, by P13 the 2nd Respondent

had proceeded to recognize the 1st Respondent as the successor.

I shall now consider the circumstances in which the 2nd Respondent issued P13.

In paragraph 13(l), (m) and (o) of his affidavit filed before this Court, the 2nd

Respondent had stated as follows:

(l) At the Land Mobile Service held by the Deputy Land Commissioner on

30.01.2014, it was observed that the 1st Respondent does not have a birth

certificate and therefore cannot prove that he is the 1st born and further it

has been stated that the 1st Respondent has agreed to give a portion of the

land to his sister and it has been decided to obtain an affidavit to that

effect.

(m) After considering all the facts the 2nd Respondent named the 1st

Respondent as the successor to Grant No. POL/LUNG/PRA/39.

(o) The documents marked as R10, R11, R12, R13 and R16 all indicate that the

original permit holder is the father of the 1st Respondent.

Thus, in the absence of a birth certificate, what is the material that the 2nd

Respondent had, to determine that the 1st Respondent is the eldest son of

Mudiyanse? The 2nd Respondent has been guided principally by three documents.

The first is a certificate issued by the Ministry of Education in 2014, marked R11,

8

which states that the name of Mudiyanse has been given as the father at the time

the 1st Respondent was admitted to school in 1958. The next is the birth certificate of

the children of the 1st Respondent marked R15 which gives the name of Mudiyanse

as the grandfather. The third is R16 which is the response of the Grama Niladhari to

the specific question posed to him by the 1st Respondent that the 1st Respondent is

the eldest son of Mudiyanse. Of the three documents, it appears to me that only

R11 and R15 would have some evidentiary value. However, I must note that the

Petitioner is challenging R11 on the basis that her request to the Ministry of

Education seeking details on the school admission of the 1st Respondent has not

been answered vide document marked X filed with the counter affidavit of the

Petitioner.

Not much weight can be attached to the other three documents referred to by the

2nd Respondent, namely R10, R12 and R13. R10 for the reason that it is a

certificate relating to the estimated age of the 1st Respondent, and hence, the

reference to Mudiyanse being the father not being relevant, and R12 and R13 for

the reason that they are affidavits of the 1st Respondent confirming that he is the

eldest son of Mudiyanse.

Thus, although it appears that R11 and R15 support the position of the 2nd

Respondent that the 1st Respondent is the eldest son of Mudiyanse, to my mind, the

said documents are not the best in terms of evidentiary value. The question that

arises in my mind is, can succession be determined on such documents, especially in

view of the position taken up by the Petitioner with regard to the paternity of the 1st

Respondent, and the absence of the birth certificate of the 1st Respondent?

It is in this context that I must consider the primary complaint of the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner that the 2nd Respondent ought to have afforded the Petitioner a

hearing prior to a decision affecting her rights being taken.

The importance of natural justice and why Courts insist upon it are captured by the

following paragraphs in Administrative Law by Wade:6

Just as the Courts can control the substance of what public authorities do by

means of the rules relating to reasonableness, improper purposes, and so forth,

6 Administrative Law by H.W.R.Wade and C.F.Forsyth; 11th Edition, pages 373 and 374.

9

so through the principles of natural justice they can control the procedure by

which they do it. In so doing they have imposed a particularly procedural

technique on government departments and statutory authorities generally. The

Courts have in effect, devised a code of fair administrative procedure based on

doctrines which are an essential part of any system of administrative justice.

Procedure is not a matter of secondary importance. As governmental powers

continually grow more drastic, it is only by procedural fairness that they are

rendered tolerable. A judge of the United States Supreme Court has said:

Procedural fairness and regularity are of the indispensable essence of liberty.

Severe substantive laws can be endured if they are fairly and impartially

applied.7 One of his colleagues said: The history of liberty has largely been the

history of the observance of procedural safeguards.8

It is true that the rules of natural justice restrict the freedom of administrative

action and that their observance costs a certain amount of time and money. But

time and money are likely to be well spent if they reduce friction in the

machinery of government; and it is because they are essentially rules for

upholding fairness and so reducing grievances, that the rules of natural justice

can be said to promote efficiency rather than impede it. Provided that the courts

do not let them run riot, and keep them in touch with the standards which good

administration demands in any case, they should be regarded as a protection

not only to citizens but also to officials. Moreover, a decision which is made

without bias, and with proper consideration of the views of those affected by it,

will not only be more acceptable; it will also be of better quality. Justice and

efficiency go hand in hand, so long at least as the law does not impose excessive

refinements."

The following passage from The Rule of Law9 examines the need to give a hearing

from the perspective of fairness:

A power must also be exercised in a way that, in all the circumstances, is fair,

since it is assumed (in the absence of a clearly expressed contrary intention) that

7 Shaughnessy v. United States, 345 US 206 (1953) (Jackson J). 8 McNabb v. United States, 318 US 332 (1943) (Frankfurter J). 9 Tom Bingham, The Rule of Law, [2011] Penguin Books.

10

the State does not intend to treat the citizen unfairly. It may of course be a

vexed question what, in the particular circumstances, fairness requires. But the

so-called rules of natural justice have traditionally been held to demand, first,

that the mind of the decision-maker should not be tainted by bias or personal

interest (he must not be a judge in his own cause) and, secondly, that anyone

who is liable to have an adverse decision made against him should have a right

to be heard (a rule the venerability of which is vouched by its Latin version: audi

alteram partem, hear the other party). This is a principle to which the courts

tend to attach great importance, and it has been described as the necessary

assumption on which to base an argumentthat the court must supplement the

procedural requirements which the Act itself stipulates by implying additional

requirements said to be necessary to ensure that the principles of natural justice

are observed The decided cases on this subject establish the principle that the

courts will readily imply terms where necessary to ensure fairness of procedure

for the protection of parties who may suffer a detriment in consequence of

administrative action.- R v Secretary of State for the Environment, ex p.

Hammersmith & Fulham London Borough Council [1991] 1 AC 521, 598 D-G.

In Gamlathge Ranjith Gamlath vs Commissioner General of Excise and two others,10

Sripavan J (as he then was) held as follows:

"It is one of the fundamental principles in the administration of justice that an

administrative body which is to decide must hear both sides and give both an

opportunity of hearing before a decision is taken. No man can incur a loss of

property by judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings unless and until he has had a

fair opportunity of answering the complaint made against him. Thus, objectors

at public inquiries must be given a fair opportunity to meet adverse evidence,

even though the statutory provisions do not cover the case expressly. (Vide

Errington v. Minister of Health11). The court would certainly regard any decision

as having grave consequences if it affects proprietary rights. In Schmidt and

another v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs12 Lord Denning M. R. suggested

that the ambit of natural justice extended not merely to protect rights but any

10 CA (Writ) Application No. 1675/2002; CA Minutes of 28th March 2003. 11 (1935) 1 KB 249. 12 (1969) 2 Ch. 149 at 170.

11

legitimate expectation of which it would not be fair to deprive a person without

hearing what he has to say.

The right of a party to be heard prior to a decision affecting his rights being taken

even where the Statute is silent on such a requirement, has been confirmed in the

following passage from the case of Lloyd v McMahon:13

In particular, it is well-established that when a statute has conferred on any

body the power to make decisions affecting individuals, the courts will not only

require the procedure prescribed by the statute to be followed, but will readily

imply so much and no more to be introduced by way of additional procedural

safeguards as will ensure the attainment of fairness.

It is clear that the 2nd Respondent was aware of the competing claims vide R19 -

and of the weaknesses in the claim of the 1st Respondent vide the entry made on

the reverse of R19, and R9. Thus, I am of the view that the 2nd Respondent ought

to have exercised caution, prior to arriving at a determination affecting the rights of

the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent. I am at a loss to understand what prompted

the 2nd Respondent to rush and issue P13 without affording a hearing to the

Petitioner who is the person occupying the land, and the 5th Respondent, both of

whom have a claim to succeed to the said land, provided they can satisfy they are

eligible to do so in terms of the Third Schedule to the Ordinance.

There is one other matter which is of concern to me, that being the allegation made

by the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent has in fact been given a land in Medirigiriya

by the State, a fact which has been referred to by Mudiyanse way back in 1979 in

R2 and R3. This is a matter that could have been addressed by the 1st Respondent,

had he filed a statement of objections and participated in these proceedings.

Taking into consideration the above legal and factual positions, I am of the view that

the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent should have been afforded a hearing by the

2nd Respondent, prior to P13 being issued. The failure to do so renders the decision

in P13 liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

13 [1987] AC 625 at 702; cited in Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth; 11th Edition pages 423-424.

12

I accordingly issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 2nd Respondent to

register the name of the 1st Respondent as the successor of Mudiyanse to the said

high land, as reflected in P13 and P14. I direct the 2nd Respondent to conduct an

inquiry with the participation of the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent and the 5th

Respondent and thereafter determine in terms of the Ordinance the person entitled

to succeed Mudiyanse in respect of the high land. I make no order with regard to

costs.
