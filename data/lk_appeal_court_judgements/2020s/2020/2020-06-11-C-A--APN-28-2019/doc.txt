The Registered Owner-Petitioner-Petitioner has filed this Revision Application

seeking to set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial

High Court of North Western Province holden in Chillaw dated 11.01.2019 in Case

No. HCR 14/2018 and seeking to set aside the order made by the Learned

Magistrate ofChillaw dated 25.10.2018 in Case No. MC 92001.

Facts of the case:

The vehicle bearing No. SGGC 8791 was taken into custody on or about

25.05.2017 for violating the conditions of the permit which was issued for the

purpose of transporting timber. The driver (hereinafter referred to as the 'accused')

of the said lorry was charged under an offence punishable under Section 25(2) of

the Forest Ordinance as Amended by Act No. 13 of 1966 and Act No. 65 of2009.

The accused pleaded guilty to the charge on 02.06.2017 and the Learned

Magistrate convicted the accused and imposed a fine of Rs. 10,000/= Thereafter a

vehicle inquiry was held with regard to the lorry that was used for the commission

of the offence. After concluding the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate confiscated

the vehicle by order dated 25.10.2018.

Page 4 of 10

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Registered Owner-Petitioner-Petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the 'Petitioner') preferred a revision application to the

Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in Chillaw under case

No. HCR 14/2018. On 11.01.2019, the Learned High Court Judge dismissed the

said revision application.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the Petitioner has preferred this application

before this Court.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted following grounds as

exceptional circumstances to invoke the Revisionary Jurisdiction of this Court, in

her Written Submission dated 07.08.2019;

1) Order dated 11.01.2019 was made by the Learned High Court Judge on a

wrong factual premise;

and

2) That the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected herself on the burden

applicable under Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance.

I. According to the submission made by the Learned Counsel for the

Petitioner, the Learned High Court Judge has made the order on a wrong

factual premise. The wrong factual premise is two way as it has been argued

by the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

I. The Learned High Court Judge has misdirected herself on the facts of

the case that the Petitioner was abroad at the time the vehicle was

taken to Police custody.

Page 5 of 10

I agree with this contention made by the Learned Counsel on behalf of

the Petitioner, as it is evident that the Learned High Court Judge has

misdirected herself on the factual situation where the Petitioner was

abroad when the case was been heard before the Magistrate Court of

Chillaw, as it has been explained by the Learned Counsel on behalf of

the Petitioner inhis submission before the Learned High Court Judge

on 11.01.2019.

I am of the view that this is a factual situation that does not go to the

root of the case as the Learned High Court Judge has clearly analysed

the fact that the Registered owner has not proven to the satisfaction of

the Court that she has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the

vehicle for the commission of the offence, and thus has not caused

any prejudice to the Petitioner.

This is proven from the Order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

11.01.2019, which states as follows:

" @ gz5l@a;)jwlS) 'YC~~~c.'l ~6~ @a:fd~~d i!SJi!h 58251'

11. The Learned High Court Judge has misdirected herself by applying

the principle laid down in Mary Matilda V. OIC Habarana -

CA(PHC) 86/97, as she has failed to appreciate the fact that unlike in

the case of Mary Matilda V. OIC Habarana, the Petitioner in the

instant case had valid license for the purpose of transporting timber on

the particular day.

As it is argued in tbe written submissions on behalf of the Petitioner, it

was held in Mary Matilda V. OIC Habarana,

"an order for confiscation cannot be made if the owner establishes

one of two matters. They are,

1) that he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence;

2) that the vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence without his

knowledge. "

In the instant case, none of these facts has been proved before the

Court and it is an offence committed under the Forest Ordinance

which requires the confiscation of the vehicle, even though the

Petitioner has had a valid license for the purpose of transporting

timber.

2) According to the submission made by the Learned Counsel for the

Petitioner, the Learned High Court Judge has misdirected herself on the

burden applicable under Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance.

Page 7 of 10

The Learned Counsel on behalf of the Petitioner had relied on the

observation made by Justice A.W.A.Salam in Abubackerge Jaleel V. OIC,

Anti-Vice unit, Police Station, Anuradhapura CA PRC 108/2010, as

follows:

"The testimony of the owner has not been discredited under cross-

examination. There has been no previous instance where the driver has been

charged for similar offence. When someone is under a duty to show cause

that he has taken all precautions against the commission of similar offences,

1 do not think that he can practically do many things than to give specific

instruction. "

In the instant case there is no evidence as to prove or even to support the fact

that the Registered owner had given any instruction or any specific

instruction as to not commit any offence by using the vehicle. The

proceedings dated 27.09.2018, before the Magistrate Court of Chillaw in

case No. 92001, is evident of the fact that the Registered owner had not even

clarified the fact that whether there is any valid permit to transport timber on

that particular day, as it is produced bellow.

Page 8 of 10

Therefore, I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge has not

misdirected herself on the burden applic.able under Section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance, in a context where the Registered owner had not made an attempt

to take any precaution to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission

of the offence.

3) Further, I see no any exceptional circumstances that allow the Petitioner to

evoke the Revisionary Jurisdiction of this Court.

In the case of Mariam Beebee V. Seyed Mohamed [68 NLR 36] it was held that,

"The power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent

of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this court. Its object is the

due administration of justice and the correction of errors, sometimes

committed by this court itself, in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice ... "

Further, in the case of Bank of Ceylon V. Kaleel and others [2004] 1 Sri L.R

284, it was held that,

"in any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must

have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifestly erroneous which go

beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would

instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which

would have shocked the conscience of court. "

Page 9 of 10

Considering above, I am of the view that there had been no miscarriage of justice

in the instant case, which warrants the invocation of the revisionary powers of this

Court. Therefore I affirm the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

11.01.2019 and the order of the Learned Magistrate dated 25.10.2018.

Accordingly this application is hereby dismissed.

I agree,
