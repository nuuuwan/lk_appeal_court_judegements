Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) annexed to

the petition marked P12, which upheld the findings and disciplinary order

imposed on the Petitioner by the Public Service Commission (PSC) and

dismissed the appeal of the Petitioner.

The facts of this application very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner had joined the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS) in April

1995, as a Class (II) Grade 2 Officer. The Petitioner had subsequently been

promoted to Class (I) in January 2007. During the period relevant to this

application, the Petitioner had served as the Divisional Secretary, Matale.

A preliminary investigation had been conducted by the Ministry of Public

Administration and Home Affairs into a complaint that the Petitioner, together

with another person by the name of Upali Dharmaratne had sexually abused

two young boys on 4th February 2011. The PSC, having considered the

Preliminary Investigation Report annexed to the petition marked P4, had

issued the charge sheet annexed to the petition marked P6, containing the

following charges:

A formal disciplinary inquiry had thereafter been held against the Petitioner,

where he was represented by a retired officer of the Sri Lanka Administrative

Service. This Court observes that the practice adopted at the inquiry was to

mark the statement made by each witness during the preliminary investigation

so that it would form part and parcel of the inquiry, and to supplement the

statement with evidence in chief, followed by cross examination and re-

examination.

The prosecution had led the evidence of several witnesses, including that of

the mother of one of the children involved. Although the evidence in chief of

one of the children was led and his cross examination had commenced, his

evidence could not be concluded as his mother had informed the Inquiry

Officer that the victim is undergoing mental stress. The proceedings of 30th

June 2014 bears out the following:

As this child could not complete his evidence, the Inquiry Officer has quite

rightly refused to act on the said evidence. This, together with the fact that the

second child did not give evidence at all, meant that there was no evidence

placed with regard to the charges relating to attempted sexual abuse, which

8

had apparently taken place at the official quarters of the Petitioner. At the

conclusion of the case for the complainant, the Inquiry Officer had afforded

the Petitioner an opportunity of giving evidence or summoning any other

person to give evidence on his behalf. The Petitioner however had not availed

himself of either of these opportunities.1

The Inquiry Officer, by his report annexed to the petition marked P9, had

found the Petitioner guilty of Charge Nos. 1, 6 and 7. The PSC, by a disciplinary

order dated 13th September 2016, had demoted the Petitioner to Class II of the

SLAS, and imposed a penalty of Rs. 30,000. Dissatisfied by this decision of the

PSC, the Petitioner had filed an appeal with the AAT. After affording the

Petitioner a hearing, the AAT, by its order P12 had held as follows:

(a) The imposition of the penalty is not enforceable in terms of PA Circular

No. 29/2011;

(b) The Petitioner had rightly been found guilty of Charge Nos. 1, 6 and 7;

(c) The punishment imposed is commensurate with the serious nature of the

charges.

Aggrieved by the said decision of the AAT, the Petitioner filed this application

seeking inter alia the aforementioned relief.

This matter was supported for notice on 9th October 2019. This Court, having

heard the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner, invited the learned

1 Vide proceedings of 20th August 2014.

9

Presidents Counsel to tender brief written submissions setting out the

grounds on which he seeks judicial review of the decision marked P12. In the

written submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioner, it has been submitted

that the decision of the Inquiry Officer is illegal and irrational, in that the

Petitioner could not have been found guilty on the material that was available

to the Inquiry Officer, and that the AAT failed to consider the said deficiencies.

The Petitioner has made available to this Court, marked P8 a complete copy

of the proceedings before the Inquiry Officer including the statements made by

the witnesses to the Officer who conducted the Preliminary Investigation, and

the report of the Inquiry Officer, thus affording this Court an opportunity of

considering the complaint of the Petitioner.

In Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service2, Lord

Diplock classified the three grounds upon which administrative action is

subject to judicial review, namely 'illegality', 'irrationality' and 'procedural

impropriety'. If the complaint of the Petitioner that there was no evidence at

all is correct, then an order made in such circumstances will be illegal. If

however there was evidence, this Court can consider whether the conclusion

arrived at is reasonable and rational. Lord Diplock went onto state that, by

irrationality I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury

unreasonableness3. It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its

defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who

had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. In

Secretary of State for Education and Science v Metropolitan Borough Council

2 1985 AC 374. 3 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation 1948(1)KB223.

10

of Tameside4 it was held that to fall within the expression of

unreasonableness it must be conduct which no sensible authority acting with

due appreciation of its responsibilities would have decided to adopt.

This Court is mindful that the function of this Court when considering an

application for a Writ of Certiorari is to look at the legality of the decision and

not whether it is right or wrong. As Lord Brightman stated in the House of

Lords in Chief Constable of North Wales Police v Evans5:

Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision

making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is

observed, the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the

abuse of power, be itself guilty of usurping power..... Judicial review, as

the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the

manner in which the decision was made.

This Court is of the view that it can consider the factual circumstances and the

evidence that was considered by the decision maker where an argument is

presented, as in this application, that the decision is unreasonable or irrational,

or where an argument is taken that there was no material at all to arrive at a

decision, resulting in an error on the face of the record. Even in such cases, the

Courts will only consider the factual circumstances to the extent of

determining whether the decision maker took into account relevant

considerations from the evidence placed before him, in making a decision. If a

decision has been influenced by considerations which either expressly or

4[1977] AC 1014. 5 [1982] 1 WLR 1155 at 1174.

11

implicitly cannot lawfully be taken into account, a Court may hold that such

discretionary power has not been exercised validly. The reasons provided for a

decision would allow Courts to effectively scrutinize the decision and detect

what factors have influenced the decision maker.

The first charge for which the Petitioner was found guilty relates to the

Petitioner taking away the two children from their residence on 4th February

2011 on the pretext that they are required to hold flags during the

Independence Day celebrations. The starting point for this charge is the

evidence of Anuruddhika Perera, the Cultural Officer attached to the Matale

District Secretariat Office at the relevant time.6 She had stated that

arrangements had been made to conduct the 63rd Independence Day

celebrations at the District Secretariat Office, Matale. The task entrusted to her

was to arrange dance troops from five schools in the area to perform at the

said celebrations. One of the schools selected was Aluvihare Madya Maha

Vidyalaya, which is the school attended to by the two children. However, due

to adverse weather conditions that prevailed in Matale prior to 4th February,

the event had been scaled down and the Principals of the five schools had

been informed in advance in writing that the dance recitals had been

cancelled.7 She had stated further that the event was held on a scaled down

basis, with the participation of about 40 persons. This witness had not been

cross examined by the defence officer. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that

the Petitioner, being the Divisional Secretary, Matale was aware that the

celebrations had been scaled down.

6 Vide proceedings of 7th March 2014. 7 Although the letters sent to the Principals of the Schools have been marked at the inquiry, copies of same have not been filed of record.

12

Ms. Anjalika Atapattu, the Administrative Officer at the District Secretariat,

Matale had confirmed that the Petitioner had been present at the ceremony,

and had left the premises after the event was concluded at about 9.45.

The next witness is the mother of one of the children, Kumari Ratnayake.8 She

had stated that her son was a dancing student and was attending dancing

classes conducted by Upali Dharmaratne. She had stated that in the morning of

4th February 2011, at about 10.30, the said Upali Dharmaratne who was known

to her, had visited her house together with the Petitioner who was not known

to her, and informed her that her son is required to hang flags for the

Independence Day celebrations. The evidence that transpired at the inquiry

was that by then, the Independence Day celebrations had already been scaled

down, and that in any event, the celebrations were over by 10.45 and there

was no necessity to take the two young children on the pretext they are

required to hang flags. The mother says that she had consented to her son

going with the said Upali Dharmaratne as she had known him for several years.

Similar evidence had been given by the mother of the other child, Heen

Menike.9

This Court has examined the report of the Inquiry Officer marked P9, and

observes that the Inquiry Officer had found the Petitioner guilty of Charge No.

1, only after he was satisfied of the following:

a) That the Petitioner had visited the house of the two children;

8 Vide proceedings of 20th June 2014. 9 Vide proceedings of 20th August 2014.

13

b) That the Petitioner had misrepresented the fact that the children were

required to assist at the Independence Day celebrations, when in fact the

celebrations had been held on a scaled down basis and had been

concluded by that time;

c) That the children would not have been released to the Petitioner, had the

parents of these two children known the correct factual position.

This Court observes that even though this witness had been cross examined, it

has not been suggested that the Petitioner did not visit the home of the

witness and/or that the Petitioner was not involved in the taking away of the

children.

The AAT, having considered the above evidence that was led before the Inquiry

Officer had come to the conclusion that the Petitioner had been rightly found

guilty of Charge No. 1. This Court, having considered the evidence that has

been led before the Inquiry Officer, is satisfied that there was sufficient

evidence to establish Charge No. 1. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the

decision of the Inquiry Officer as well as that of the AAT is not only legal but is

also reasonable in light of the evidence that was placed before it. The decision

of the AAT is certainly not a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of

logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied

his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.10 On the

contrary, it is the view of this Court that the decision of the AAT is a decision

10 Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service; Supra.

14

which a sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities

would have decided to adopt11.

Charge No. 7, which is a consequential charge that the Petitioner has brought

the Public Service to disrepute by committing the acts accused of in Charge

Nos. 1-5, has also been established by virtue of the Petitioner being found

guilty for Charge No.1.

The only issue left for this Court to consider in relation to Charge Nos. 1 and 7

is whether the punishment imposed on the Petitioner is excessive and

unreasonable. As observed earlier, the Petitioner had been demoted to Class II.

This Court is of the view that the said punishment imposed by the PSC on the

Petitioner is extremely reasonable, and in fact, lenient, especially in the

context of the purpose for which the two children were said to have been

taken for, which charge could not be established due to the absence of the

testimony of the children, for the reasons mentioned earlier in this Order. This

Court is therefore in agreement with the decision of the AAT that the

punishment imposed is commensurate with the serious nature of the charges.

This Court shall now consider whether the decision that the Petitioner is guilty

of Charge No. 6 is reasonable. This Court must observe that this charge has no

nexus to any of the previous charges, and the outcome of this charge has no

bearing on the other charges. As noted earlier, the Petitioner had been found

guilty of Charge No. 6, which is that the Petitioner had made a false statement

during the Preliminary Investigation that his driver was present when he

11 Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council; Supra.

15

engaged in field activity on 4th February 2011. The driver assigned to the

Petitioner, Wasantha Kumara had denied that he accompanied the Petitioner

on any field visits that day. He had stated further that he did not sign the

running chart of 4th February 2011 pertaining to the vehicle allocated to the

Petitioner, although all other running charts had been signed by him, thereby

confirming that he did not drive the vehicle that day.

During his evidence in chief, Wasantha Kumara had admitted that all what he

had said in the statement made to the Officer conducting the Preliminary

Investigation is correct. However, during cross examination, he had retracted

his position and stated that he had accompanied the Petitioner, after meeting

the Petitioner at 1pm that afternoon. The Inquiry Officer however had acted

upon the position taken up by Wasantha Kumara that he stands by the

statement he made during the Preliminary Investigation, the effect of which is

that he did not accompany the Petitioner on his field visits, and arrived at the

conclusion that the Petitioner is guilty of Charge No. 6. The Inquiry Officer had

also recommended that disciplinary action be taken against Wasantha Kumara

for giving false evidence.

This Court cannot fault the Inquiry Officer and the AAT for having acted upon

the statement made by Wasantha Kumara, especially since he had not signed

the running chart for that day, which is the best evidence in light of the

circumstances to suggest that he did not accompany the Petitioner. However,

even if the benefit of the doubt could have been extended to the Petitioner in

view of the evidence given during cross examination, and the Petitioner was

exonerated of Charge No. 6, this Court is of the view that such a decision

would not have any effect on the finding of the Inquiry Officer and the AAT on

16

Charge Nos. 1 and 7, nor would it impact on the punishment imposed on the

Petitioner as a result of being found guilty for Charge Nos. 1 and 7.

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner has not

established a prima facie case that warrants this Court issuing formal notice of

this application on the Respondents. This application is accordingly dismissed,

without costs.
