RESPONDENTS Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Pradeep Fernando for the Petitioner Suranga Wimalasena, Senior State Counsel for the Respondents Argued on: 28th September 2020 Decided on: 16th November 2020

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner is a company duly incorporated under the Companies Act No. 7 of

2007. The Petitioner states that it is engaged in the importation and distribution of

medicinal products in Sri Lanka, including a medicated bathing bar named Psorolin.

The Petitioner states further that Psorolin is an Ayurvedic medicinal product which

has been prescribed for the cure of a skin condition known as Psoriasis.

According to the Petitioner Psorolin has been registered with the Department of

Ayurveda, as borne out by letter dated 21st July 2017 marked X2 issued by the

Department of Ayurveda, under Schedule 3 of the product classification issued by

the Department of Ayurveda. Accordingly, this product cannot be sold over the

counter and requires a prescription to be purchased by a consumer.

The issue that culminated in this application relates to one of classification of the

said product Psorolin. It would therefore be appropriate to briefly consider at this

stage the manner in which goods are classified for Customs purposes. The World

Customs Organization (WCO),1 recognising that all Customs and Border agencies

around the world must classify the identical good in the identical manner for

purposes of levying import and export tariffs, have developed and introduced a

multipurpose international product nomenclature system known as the

Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System, which is generally

referred to as the Harmonised System or simply HS. The Harmonised System is

governed by the International Convention on the Harmonised Commodity

Description and Coding System.

The Harmonised System is used by more than 200 countries and economies as a

basis for levying Customs tariffs, and over 98% of the merchandise in international

trade is classified in terms of the Harmonised System. The Harmonised System

contributes to the harmonisation of Customs and trade procedures, and the non-

documentary trade data interchange in connection with such procedures, thus

reducing the costs related to international trade. The Harmonised System has been

1 http://www.wcoomd.org/en/topics/nomenclature/overview/what-is-the-harmonized-system.aspx

3

referred to as a universal economic language and code for goods, and is an

indispensable tool for international trade.

Harmonisation of classification of goods which are imported and exported ensures

that international trade takes place in a way that does not harm the economic

interests of Member countries, and that there is no loss of revenue to the State in

respect of customs duties and other fiscal levies due upon importation and

exportation of goods. Proper and accurate classification is therefore vital in order to

ensure Sri Lankas international obligations as a Member of the World Customs

Organization.

The Harmonised System comprises of more than 5,000 commodity groups; each

identified by a six digit code, arranged in a legal and logical structure and is

supported by well-defined rules to achieve uniform classification. While the first two

digits refer to the Chapter of the Harmonised System Code, the last two digits are

inserted by the National Body, in this instance, Sri Lanka Customs, to cater to the

specific requirements of Sri Lanka. The Harmonised System has been introduced to

Sri Lanka through the National Imports Tariff Guide issued by Sri Lanka Customs and

published in the Government Gazette.

Chapter 30 of the National Imports Tariff Guide issued by Sri Lanka Customs, marked

X4 is titled Pharmaceutical Products. The Petitioner states that goods which have

been certified by the Department of Ayurveda as being Schedule 03 preparations can

be classified under HS Code Classification No. 30.04.90.13.

The Petitioner claims that it has imported Psorolin to Sri Lanka on several occasions,

and has submitted Customs Declarations marked X5 X9 in proof thereof. The

Petitioner states that the goods imported under the aforementioned Customs

Declarations have been declared under HS Code Classification No. 30.04.90.13, and

have been cleared upon payment of duties due under HS Code Classification No.

30.04.90.13. I have examined the said Customs Declarations and observe that while

the above statement of the Petitioner is correct, the Petitioner has described the

goods as Siddha medicines, as opposed to describing the goods as medicinal soap.

4

The Petitioner states that he imported a further consignment of Psorolin in January

2018, and submitted Customs Declaration marked X10 under the same HS Code

Classification as on previous occasions. I must however observe that in this instance

i.e. in X10 - the description of the goods was different than on previous occasions,

in that, in addition to the words, Siddha medicines, the Petitioner has declared

specifically that the goods are Psorolin Medicated Bathing Bar 75gm. The Petitioner

states that even though he paid the Customs duty due under HS Code Classification

No. 30.04.90.13, Sri Lanka Customs refused to release the goods to him on the basis

that the HS Code classification is wrong.

At the request of the Petitioner, the matter had been referred to the Nomenclature

Committee of Sri Lanka Customs. After an inquiry by the Nomenclature Committee,

the Petitioner had been informed that the said product must be declared under HS

Code Classification No. 34.01.11.90. The Petitioner had accordingly been directed to

pay the duties due under HS Code Classification No. 34.01.11.90. It must be observed

that the amount payable as duty and other levies under HS Code Classification No.

34.01.11.90 is higher than what is payable under HS Code Classification No.

30.04.90.13.

Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioner filed this application, seeking a

Writ of Mandamus directing Sri Lanka Customs to release the goods declared by

X10. This Court issued formal notice of this application on the Respondents on 19th

July 2018. Having obtained a bank guarantee to cover the difference in duty between

the two HS Code Classifications, Sri Lanka Customs released the said goods to the

Petitioner, pending the determination of this application. The release of the goods,

even though on a bank guarantee, is the final relief sought by the Petitioner in this

application.

Although the Petitioner has not sought a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of

Sri Lanka Customs to classify the goods under HS Code Classification No. 34.01.11.90,

the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the said decision is illegal,

unreasonable and contrary to the provisions of the National Imports Tariff Guide

issued by Sri Lanka Customs. He reiterated that as the product Psorolin has been

5

registered by the Department of Ayurveda under Schedule 3, the correct HS Code

Classification is 30.04.9013.

I must say that this Court does not have the expertise to engage in the classification

of a good imported to the country, nor would it attempt to do so in the exercise of its

Writ jurisdiction. That expertise lies with Sri Lanka Customs, and its Nomenclature

Committee, as well as with the World Customs Organisation. In instances where

Courts lack such expertise, Courts would defer to the views of such expert bodies.

The extent to which a Court exercising Writ jurisdiction should defer to the findings

of an administrative body has been discussed by the Canadian Supreme Court in

Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick2 in the following passage:

Deference is both an attitude of the court and a requirement of the law of

judicial review. It does not mean that courts are subservient to the

determinations of decision makers, or that courts must show blind reverence

to their interpretations, or that they may be content to pay lip service to the

concept of reasonableness review while in fact imposing their own view.

Rather, deference imports respect for the decision-making process of

adjudicative bodies with regard to both the facts and the law. The notion of

deference is rooted in part in a respect for governmental decisions to create

administrative bodies with delegated powers (Canada (Attorney General) v.

Mossop, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554, at p. 596, per LHeureux-Dub J., dissenting). We

agree with David Dyzenhaus where he states that the concept of deference as

respect requires of the courts not submission but a respectful attention to

the reasons offered or which could be offered in support of a decision: The

Politics of Deference: Judicial Review and Democracy, in M. Taggart, ed., The

Province of Administrative Law (1997), 279, at p. 286 (quoted with approval

in Baker, at para. 65, per LHeureux-Dub J.; Ryan, at para. 49).

Although Courts do show deference to the views of expert bodies, that would

however not prevent this Court from examining the reasonableness of the decision

taken by Sri Lanka Customs with regard to the classification of a good. 2 [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, 2008 SCC 9.

6

This position has been encapsulated in the following manner in Administrative Law

by Wade and Forsyth:3

The doctrine that powers must be exercised reasonably has to be reconciled

with the no less important doctrine that the court must not usurp the discretion

of the public authority.....

Decisions which are extravagant or capricious cannot be legitimate. But if the

decision is within the confines of reasonableness, it is no part of the courts

function to look further into its merits.

It has been further stated in De Smiths Judicial Review4 that:

The question of the appropriate measure of deference, respect, restraint,

latitude or discretionary area of judgment (to use some of the terms variously

employed) which Courts should grant the primary decision maker under this

head of review is one of the most complex in all of public law and goes to the

heart of the principle of the separation of powers. This is because there is often

a fine line between assessment of the merits of the decision (evaluation of fact

and policy) and the assessment of whether the principles of just administrative

action have been met. The former questions are normally matters for the

primary decision-maker, but the latter are within the appropriate capacity of

the courts to decide.

Bearing this in mind, I shall now consider whether the decision of Sri Lanka Customs

to reject the classification submitted by the Petitioner and the decision of Sri Lanka

Customs to classify Psorolin under HS Code Classification No. 34.01.11.90, is legal,

rational and reasonable.

Chapter 30 of the National Imports Tariff Guide marked X4 issued by Sri Lanka

Customs applies to Pharmaceutical products, while Chapter 34 of the said Tariff

Guide marked X11 applies to soap. The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that

even though preparations certified by the Department of Ayurveda under Schedule 3

fall within Chapter 30 and more specifically under HS Code Classification No.

30.04.90.13, Item 1(a) of the Notes to Chapter 30 has specified that the said Chapter

does not cover soap or other products of heading 34.01 containing added

medicaments. In other words, the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel is

that medicated soap cannot be classified under Chapter 30 as the Harmonised

System has excluded it from Chapter 30.

This position of the learned Senior State Counsel is confirmed by the Explanatory

Notes to the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System [Sixth Edition

(2017)] issued by the World Customs Organisation, marked R3. While the Notes to

Chapter 30 confirms the position in X4, R3 makes it clear that Medicated soaps

however they are put up are excluded from the categorization of medicaments

vide paragraph (d) of the exclusions in R3.

It is admitted by the Petitioner that Psorolin is an Ayurvedic medicinal product. Thus,

by virtue of being a medicinal product certified by the Department of Ayurveda as an

item coming under Schedule 3, Psorolin could have been classified under HS Code

30.04.90.13, if not for the exclusion in the Notes to Chapter 30, of soaps that

contain medicaments. Thus, I agree with the submission of the learned Senior State

Counsel that Psorolin cannot be classified under HS Code Classification No.

30.04.90.13. The decision of Sri Lanka Customs to reject HS Code Classification No.

30.04.90.13 for Psorolin reflects the clear position laid down in the National Imports

Tariff Guide and the Explanatory Notes issued by the World Customs Organisation.

I shall now consider the decision of Sri Lanka Customs that Psorolin must be classified

under HS Code Classification No. 34.01.11.90.

HS Code Classification No.34.01 carries the following description Soap; organic

surface-active products and preparations, in the form of bars, cakes, moulded pieces

or shapes,.... In terms of Item 2 of the Notes to Chapter 34 of the National Imports

8

Tariff Guide marked X11, Soap and the other products of heading 34.01 may

contain added substances (for example, disinfectants, abrasive powders, fillers or

medicaments). While HS Code Classification No. 34.01.11 carries the description,

For toilet use (including medicated products), HS Code Classification No. 34.01.11.90

is for bathing bars. In terms of Chapter 34 of the Explanatory Notes R3, soaps

include medicated soaps containing boric acid, salicylic acid, sulphur,

sulphoanomides or other medicated substances.

It is admitted by the Petitioner that Psorolin is a medicated bathing bar. Whether it

contains medicaments or not, it is a bathing bar, which therefore must be classified

under HS Code Classification No. 34.01.11. While toilet soap and baby soap have

been assigned the National Classification of 10, bathing bars have been assigned the

National Classification of 90. This is the reason for the decision of Sri Lanka Customs

to apply HS Code Classification No. 34.01.11.90 for Psorolin.

In my view, the above decisions of Sri Lanka Customs reflect the position in the

National Imports Tariff Guide and are decisions which are reasonable and rational.

Applying the definition given to irrationality by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil

Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service,5 it is certainly not a decision which is

so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible

person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at

it.

In these circumstances, I am of the view that even if the goods had still been in the

custody of Sri Lanka Customs, this Court could not have issued a Writ of Mandamus

directing the goods to be released. It is trite law that for a Mandamus to issue, the

applicant must have a legal right to clear the goods, and Sri Lanka Customs must

have a legal duty to release the goods. The legal right arises only if the goods have

been declared by the submission of a bill of entry as required by Section 47, and the

description, classification and value of the good have been entered correctly.

Similarly, the public duty on the part of Sri Lanka Customs to release a good arises

5 [1985] AC 374.

only where there has been a truthful declaration of the description, classification and

value of the goods.

Taking into consideration all of the above, I do not see any legal basis in the

complaint of the Petitioner, nor any legal basis to grant the relief prayed for. This

application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
