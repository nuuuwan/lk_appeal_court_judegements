Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Pugoda dated

31.03.2000.

The Plaintiffs originally instituted the case bearing no. 23142/L in the District Court of Gampaha

seeking inter alia a declaration of title to the land called Lot E of Kahatagahawatta alias Delowita

more fully described in the schedule to the plaint dated 04.12.1980 [Page 75 of the Appeal Brief].

The Plaintiffs averred in their plaint that-

1. The 2nd Defendant became entitled to the said land under and by virtue of Deed of

Partition No. 3965 dated 02.05.1928 attested by D. Lorage, Notary Public ( ~l 3);

2. He transferred it to the Plaintiffs by Deed of Transfer No. 1974 dated 04.01.1980 attested

by D. E. N. Abhayasinghe, Notary Public for valuable consideration ( ~l 4);

3. The 1st Defendant is possessing the said land unlawfully and wrongfully and causing

damages amounting to Rs. 200/- per month.

The lA Substituted Defendant filed her answer on 28.05.1982 disputing the corpus and claiming

prescriptive title to the lands morefully described in the schedules to the answer [Page 78 of the

Appeal Brief]. Her contention is that the land depicted in plan no. 2294/q; (~ll) includes Lots 4

and 5 in final plan no. 3627 and the said Lot 5 was allotted to the 1st Defendant by the final decree

in District Court of Gampaha case no. 18404/P. Further, it was stated that the balance portion of

the land depicted in plan no. 2294/q; is Lot D of Kahatagahawatta which also belonged to the 1st

Defendant by inheritance and prescription and later conveyed to the lA Substituted Defendant

by Deed of Gift No. 3405 dated 15.05.1969 attested by D. L. S. Wickramasinghe, Notary Public

(~l8) .

A commission was executed to survey and properly identify the land in dispute. Accordingly, S. H.

P. Kottegoda, Licensed Surveyor prepared the plan no. 00-1075 dated 14.02.1983 (X) after

superimposing the said plans no. 3627 and no. 2294/q;. According to the surveyor's report Lot If

thereof is claimed by the Defendant and Lot 5 thereof is Lot 5 in final plan no. 3627.

After a lengthy trial, the learned District Judge of Gampaha, by judgment dated 15.07.1985,

declared that the Plaintiffs are the owners of the land depicted in plan no. 2294/q;.

Being aggrieved, the 1A Substituted Defendant preferred an appeal to this Court in case bearing

no. 330/1985(F). The judgment was delivered on 22.11.1994 [Page 70 of the Appeal Brief] where

it was held that the learned District Judge of Gampaha erred in declaring that the Plaintiffs are

the owners of the land depicted in plan no. 2294/q; which includes Lot 5 in final plan no. 3627 as

per the surveyor's report of plan no. 00-1075. The case was remitted back for re-trial.

The case was heard before the Additional District Judge of Pugoda (case no. 81/L). The land in

dispute was identified as Lot If in plan no. 00-1075 and it was admitted that Lot 5 therein belonged

to the 1st Defendant. The contention of the 1A Substituted Defendant was that Lots If and 5 of

plan no. 00-1075 was possessed by the 1st Defendant (and then by her) as one land for several

decades and claimed prescriptive title.

By the judgment dated 31.03.2000 [Page 233 of the Appeal Brief], the learned Additional District

Judge of Pugoda rejected the position taken up by the 1A Substituted Defendant and granted a

declaration of title in favour of the Plaintiff. Hence this appeal by the 1A Substituted Defendant.

The Plaintiffs assert ownership to Lot If in plan no. 00-1075 and contend that the 1A Substituted

Defendant is in unlawful and wrongful occupation of it. The Plaintiffs seek for a declaration of

title. Clearly, the Plaintiffs' action is an actia rei vindicatia.

It is an established principle that ownership of the property claimed in a rei vindicatio action is a

fundamental condition to its maintainability [De Silva v. Gaanetileke (32 N.L.R. 217), Pathirana v.

Jayasundara (58 N.L.R. 169), Mansil v. Devaya (1985) 2 srLL.R. 46, Latheef v. Mansaar (2010) 3

SrLL.R. 333] and the burden is on the Plaintiff to establish the title pleaded and relied on by him

[Dharmadasa v. Jayasena (1997) 3 SrLL.R. 327].

In Karunadasa v. Abdul Hameed (60 N.L.R. 352) Sansoni, J. observed-

"In a rei vindicatia actian, it is highly dangeraus to adjudicate an an issue of prescription

withaut first gaing into and examining the dacumentary title af the parties."

The Plaintiffs rely on 'oI3' and 'oI4' in establishing their title which were marked during the trial

without any objections. The 2nd Defendant gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiffs and stated

that the 1st Defendant remained on the disputed land as his licensee [Pages 127 and 135 of the

Appeal Brief].

Furthermore, the Plaintiffs have marked the plaint dated 16.06.1975 in District Court of Gampaha

case no. 18404/P as 'oI6'. It is admitted that the 1st Defendant became entitled to lot 5 in plan

no. ID-l075 (i.e. lot 5 in final plan no. 3627) by virtue of the final decree entered in case no.

18404/P. A careful perusal of the schedule of 'oI6' shows that the land sought to be partitioned

in case no. 18404/P is lot D of Kahatagahawatta which is bounded on the east by lot E of the

same land. An alternative description ofthe said lot D [Pages 308 - 309 of the Appeal Brief] states

that the east boundary of lot D of Kahatagahawatta is the land owned by Randawane

Gammuladani. Thus, an inference can be gathered that lot E of Kahatagahawatta belonged to

Randawane Gammuladani in 1975. The evidence led in case no. 81/l shows that Randawane

Gammuladani is the 2nd Defendant ofthe same action. The document marked 'oI7' also supports

the said premise.

By the documents marked 'olll' and 'oI12', the 1st Defendant has signed and accepted the

ownership and/or title of the 2nd Defendant. When the lA Substituted Defendant was cross-

examined regarding the said documents and the signature of the 1st Defendant, the learned

District Judge has noted that she was reluctant to answer the questions put to her [Page 180 of

the Appeal Brief].

In view of the above, I hold that the learned Additional District Judge was correct in holding that

the paper title of the disputed land is with the Plaintiffs.

This leaves the question of prescriptive title pleaded by the lA Substituted Defendant. She stated

that she and her predecessors were in possession of the disputed land for several decades prior

to the date of the plaint.

In an action for declaration of title to property, where the legal title is in the Plaintiff but the

property is in the possession of the Defendant, the burden of proof is on the Defendant. If a

person goes into possession of land as an agent for another, prescription does not begin to run

until he has made it manifest that he is holding adversely to his principal [Siyaneris v. Jayasinghe

Udenis De Silva (52 N.L.R. 289)].

It is clear by the evidence of the 2nd Defendant that the 1st Defendant was in the possession of

the disputed land prior his demise.

However, as I observed earlier, the 1" Defendant has signed and accepted the ownership and/or

title of the 2nd Defendant by '~111' and '~112'. Therefore, if the 1" Defendant prescribed to the

disputed land, he should have done it after the signing of these documents in 1967.

In Juliana Hamine v. Dan Thomas (59 N.L.R. 546 at page 548), L. W. De Silva, A. J. held-

"The paper title being in the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, the burden af praving a title by

prescription was on the Plaintiff. That burden he has foiled to discharge. Aport from the

use of the word possess, the witnesses called by the Plaintiff did not describe the manner

of possession. Such evidence is of no value where the Court has to find a title by

prescription. On this aspect, it is sufficient to recall the observations of Bertram C. J. in the

Full Bench Case of Alwis v. Perera [1 {1919} 21 NLR at 326}:

"I wish very much that District Judges - I speak not particularly, but generally -

when a witness says 'I possessed' or 'We possessed' or 'We took the produce',

would not confine themselves merely to recording the words, but would insist on

those words being explained and exemplified. I wish District Judges would abandon

the present practice of simply recording these wards when stated by the witnesses,

and wauld see that such facts as the witnesses have in their minds are stated in full

and appear in the record."

In determining the question of prescriptive title, it is also important to bear in mind that it is a

means of defeating the paper title a party holds and in this context as Udalagama J. held in D. R.

Kiriamma v. J. A. Podibanda and 8 Others [(2005) BU 9 at page 11]-

"Onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the party claiming prescriptive

possession. Importantly, prescription is a question of fact. Physical possession is a factum

probandum. I am inclined to the view that considerable circumspection is necessary to

recognize the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party

having paper title. It is in fact said that title by prescription is an illegality made legal due

to the other party not taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri Lanka prescriptive title

is required to be by title adverse to an independent to that of a claimant or plaintiff."

However, the evidence of the 1A Substituted Defendant doesn't reveal any "overt act" by which

her predecessor (i.e. the 1" Defendant) started holding the disputed land adversely to his

principal (i.e. the 2nd Defendant) after 1967.

Page 6 of 8

In this context it is also important to bar in mind that the 1" and 2nd Defendants were cousins and

that the 2nd Defendant transferred the corpus to the Plaintiffs in 1980. Thus from 1967 to 1980

the question of prescription is between cousins. In De Silva v. Commissianer General of Inland

Revenue (80 N.L.R. 292 at 295) Sharvananda J. (as he was then) stated that:

"The principle of law is well established that a person who bases his title in adverse

possession must show by clear and unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile

to the real owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property claimed. In order

to constitute adverse possession, the possession must be in denial ofthe title ofthe true

owner. The acts of the person in possession should be irreconcilable with the rights of the

true owner; the person in possession must claim to be so as of right as against the true

owner. Where there is no hostility to or denial of the title of the true owner there can be

no adverse possession. In deciding whether the alleged acts of the person constitute

adverse possession, regard must be had to the animus ofthe person doing those acts, and

this must be ascertained from the facts and circumstances of each case and the

relationship of the parties. Possession which may be presumed to be adverse in the case

of a stranger may not attract such a presumption, in the case of persons standing in

certain social or legal relationships. The presumption represents the most likely

inference that may be drawn in the context of the relationship of the parties. The Court

will always attribute possession to a lawful title where that is possible. Where the

possession may be either lawful or unlawful, it must be assumed, in the absence of

eVidence, that the possession is lawful. Thus, where property belonging to the mother is

held by the son, the presumption will be that the enjoyment of the son was on behalf of

and with the permission of the mother. Such permissive possession is not in denial of the

title of the mother and is consequently not adverse to her. It will not enable the

possession to acquire title by adverse possession. Where possession commenced with

permission, it will be presumed to so continue until and unless something adverse

occurred about it. The onus is on the licensee to show when and how the possession

became adverse. Continued appropriation of the income and payment of taxes will not

be sufficient to convert permissive possession into adverse possession, unless such

conduct unequivocally manifests denial of the permitter's title. In order to discharge

such onus, there must be clear and affirmative evidence of the change in the character of

possession. The evidence must point to the time of commencement of adverse

Page 7 of 8

possession. Where the parties were not at arm's length, strong evidence of a positive

character is necessary to establish the change of character." (emphasis added)

Accordingly, I hold that the learned Additional District Judge has correctly evaluated the evidence

and concluded that the lA Substituted Defendant has not fulfilled the burden of proof on her in

establishing prescriptive title. The facts relied on by the learned Additional District Judge indeed

establish that the lA Substituted Defendant did not have undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession for more than ten years of the land claimed by her by title adverse to that of the

Plaintiffs and their predecessors.

For all the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the Additional

District Judge of Pugoda dated 31.03.2000.

The appeal is dismissed with costs.
