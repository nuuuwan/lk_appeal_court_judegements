After reading out the indictment to the Accused Appellant, he opted for a non-jury trial. Prosecution led evidence of six witnesses including an eye witness Gnanawathi (PW1). Upon closing the prosecution case the Accused-Appellant has made a dock statement and one witness Rajaguru Mudiyanselage Rohitha (ex-army officer) testified in support of the alibi taken up by the Accused Appellant.

After trial the Accused was convicted for all three charges by the Learned High Court Judge and imposed death sentences. Being aggrieved by the aforementioned convictions and sentences, the Accused-Appellant preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

In the written submissions dated 26-06-2019 the separate grounds of appeal were not urged by the Appellant, but following infirmities were brought to the notice as grounds of appeal for the Accused-Appellant:-

I. Infirmities in the evidence of the sole eye witness.

1.1 . Per-se Contradictions in her evidence in examination-in-chief and in cross examination 1.2. Belated statement of the eye witness to the Police

2. Doubt about the light emanated from the bulb which was near the back door was not

sufficient to identify the person who was 10ft away from the witness and the deceased.

3. There's no evidence to convict the accused for the 03'd charge.

4. Rejecting the defence of alibi is highly unreasonable.

The trial was taken up before three Judges, accordingly proceedings were duly adopted.

The Prosecution led the evidence of Gnanawathi (wife of the I" deceased Dharmasinghe), Jayaratne Banda (Brother of the deceased Dharmasinghe and the father of the 3'd deceased Chandana), JMO, ASP, Udayachandra- Retired Police Officer, Susil Senaratne (Judicial Translator)

Facts of the Case

According to the prosecution it was revealed that the deceased Abeyratne was a relative of Gnanawathi and he was living with the deceased Dharmasinghe and Gnanawathi at their boutique. On 29-03-2004 the day of the alleged incident, three of them have gone to Dharmasinghe's brother's house (Jayaratne Banda's) and returned home around 9.30 pm. Thereafter 1 st deceased Dharmasinghe and wife Gnanawathi have gone towards the rear door

(kitchen door) of their boutique while deceased Abeyratne was taking a bedsheet and a pillow and proceeded towards the front side of the boutique to sleep. (she stated that all the lights were illuminated at that time)

After entering the boutique from the rear door, deceased Dharmasinghe has asked for a glass of water from Gnanawathi and she asked hjm to take water and gone to the room to take the torch. At that time deceased Dhannasinghe was near the kitchen door.

Thereafter she heard a sound of a gunshot and she has gone to her husband deceased Dharmasinghe and screamed. Then another shot was fired. Just then Abeyratne had come to that place. When the assailant was about to shoot Abeyratne, Gnanawathi had run away. Then she has heard a sound of the thjrd gunshot. She ran to Jayaratne Banda's house but she heard a scream from there and then she has returned back to the boutique. After she returned to the boutique her husband was taken to the hospital by a vehicle. She has not seen deceased Abeyratne.

Jayaratne Banda stated that after his brother, Gnanawathi and Abeyratne left he heard 3 gunshots and after a while he went towards his brother's boutique to inspect. At that time deceased Chandana Kumara was sleeping in the house. Thereafter without going to the boutique he has stayed for 10-12 minutes near the "samithi shalawa" and at that time his two sons - Wasantha Kumara and deceased Chandana Kumara had come to that place. When they were trying to go near the boutique Jayarathne Banda had stopped them and he has gone all by himself towards the tank. He asked both his sons not to go anywhere. Before going to the boutique he heard another firing and heard his son Chandana Kumara's scream. When he returned near the said hall the deceased Chandana Kumara was lying on the ground with bleeding injuries. His other son-Wasantha Kumara had come near them after that and at the trial when he was questioned by the prosecution whether he asked him what happened, he has answered as "Yes" but has not been questioned further on Wasantha's reply. And he has not seen either the Accused or the person who shot his son Chandana Kumara and no dying declaration available.

The JMO, testified that all three murders were caused by gunshots with smooth bore gun.

[n the evidence of the ASP, he stated inter alia that when he went to the boutique around [.15 am on the following day, deceased Dharmasinghe's dead body was not there and only deceased Abeyratne's dead body was lying in a corner of the kitchen. As per some infonnation, he has inquired about the Accused, but he was unable to arrest the Accused since he was not available at his residence. On the following month the Accused had come to the police station and surrendered himself. He has testified with regard to the previous incident which has taken place (bombing incident) on 2003-10-10 or 13th (two dates were stated in Gnanawathi's evidence) at deceased Dharamasinghe's boutique, the Accused-Appellant of the instant case was not a suspect in the bombing incident. Further, when the Learned High Court Judge questioned him whether he was able to find the occupation of the Accused he has stated that it was revealed, that the Accused was an Anny deserter (pg no.245)

When carrying out the investigations, the OIC has instructed the investigating team not to conduct investigations regarding the alleged incident since Gnanawathi and Jayaratne Banda has complained the SSP for conducting further investigations when having an eye witness. It was revealed by the evidence of the retired Police Officer - Udayachandra (vide pages 254-255) An investigation was conducted by the Military Police regarding the alleged incident.

The Accused-Appellant has taken the defence of alibi and made a dock statement. Rajaguru Mudiyanselage Rohitha was called as a defence witness to prove that on the day of the alleged incident Accused was in the Army Camp.

Counsel for the Accused-Appellant contended following infirmities in the prosecution case:-

I) Following contradictions of Gnanawathi a) On pg no. 147 in the appeal brief she testifies that she has seen Abeyratne being shot and after that she ran away. But in pg no. III she testifies that after the second firing she ran away and after she fell down near the fence she has seen the accused running away towards the tank after shooting to Abeyratne. Again in pg no. 148 she has testified that the Accused has chased behind her. b) Gnanawathi testified that Abeyratne has been shot once but in contrary to the said evidence the JMO testified in pg no.197 that as per the autopsy done by him seems

like three shots had been fired at Abeyratne c) Evidence given in pg no. 108, I 09 contradicted to the evidence given in pg no. 144 as

the exact place where the witness was and the deceased Dharmasinghe was at the time of shooting 2) Other than Gnanawathi, prosecution has not called any witnesses to prove that the

Accused was there in the village when the alleged incident took place. 3) No DNA evidence has been taken on the blood stains found in the kitchen or no

Government Analyst has been called or produced the bullets for inspection to check whether all the bullets are from the same gun. 4) No weapon found.

5) The police investigations have been stopped due to a complaint by Gnanawathi and

Jayaratne Banda on the basis that there's no reason to carry out further investigations when there is an eye witness.

The following infirmities elicited by the DSG for the Respondent in the defence case:-

I) No documentary evidence on the plea of alibi. 2) Summonses were issued on three witnesses but only one has given evidence for the defence.

The only available witness for Chandana Kumara's murder was his brother Wasantha Kumara, but either his evidence or his father Jayarathne Banda's evidence was not led adequately by the

5

prosecution and not cross examined by the defence questioning about what happened thereafter (vide pages 170, 180,181) When considering the available evidence, it is clear that either Gnanawathi or father of the 3'd deceased - Chandana Kumara merely seen the assailant who shot at the 3,d deceased. Therefore 3'd charge should fail due to non-availability of evidence.

I wish to draw my attention to the contradictions of the witnesses sited by the Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant.

When contradictions are considered the above mentioned contradictions cannot be given so much of weight since those contradictions do not go to the root of the case. As per Sriskandarajah, J. in Premasiri and another V. Republic of Sri Lanka [2012[ 1 SLR 43

"'Keerthi Bandara 's case and Muniralne 's case, are in relation to omission or contradiclion olwitness in relalion to Ihe identity oflhe accused. The identity oflhe accused goes 10 Ihe very root of the case, but in the inslant case the so called contradiction or omission is in relation to a slatement of lac I. Therefore this omission or contradiclion cannot be trealed as vital and il will nol affectlhe credibility of Ihe witness in any way"

The Learned Counsel for the appellant has drawn the attention of court for the delay of the 151 complaint by the wife of the I sl deceased. It is proved from the available evidence that the funeral of the 1 sl deceased was held on the 31 SI and the 1 sl complaint was made on the day of the funeral and therefore the reason for the delay speaks to itself.

In Sumanasena V. AG [1999[ 3 SLR 137 it was held that:

"'I) Evidence must not be counled bUI weighed and Ihe evidence of a single solilary witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a Court of law.

2) Just because Ihe wilness is a belaled witness Court oughl nollo reject his lestimony on that score alone, Court must inquire inlo Ihe reason for the delay and iflhe reason for Ihe delay is plausible and juslifiable Ihe Court could acl on Ihe evidence of a belaled witness"

In Ajit Samarakoon V. The Republic (Kobaigane Murder Case) [20041 2 SLR 209 it was held

that,

"Jus I because Ihe statemenl of a witness is belated the Coul'l is not entitled to rejecl such testimony. In applying the tesl of spontaneity, the lest of conlemporaneity and Ihe lest of promptness the courl ought to scrupulously proceed to exercise the reasons for Ihe delay. If

the reasons for Ihe delay are justifiable and probable Ihe trial judge is entitled 10 acl on the evidence of a witness who had made a belaled slatemenl. "

Therefore it is evident that there aren't any infirmities in the evidence of the eye witness with regard to the 1st and the 2nd incidents of Murder. Also it is evident that Court ought not to reject a testimony of a belated witness, when reasons for the delay are justifiable and probable.

Further the Learned Counsel for the Appellant has drawn attention of Court to the defence of alibi taken up by the Accused-Appellant in his doc statement. He has not taken up this position at the non-summary stage other than the doc statement.

In the case of Jayatissa V. HOIl. Attomey Gelleral12010) I SLR 279

"When alibi is set up as a defence, there are certain fundamentals to be observed:-a) lj an alibi is established by unsuspected testimony, that will be satisfaclory and

conclusive. b) An alibi should cover the time of the alleged ojJence so as to exclude the Accused's presence at the crime scene at the relevant time. c) The credibility of an alibi is greatly enhanced, ifi! was set up at the time Ihe accusation was first made and was conslantly mainlained. lj it is laken up belaledly-Ihe ejJecl of Ihe alibi will be less. d) An alibi can be falsified by mistaken identity and Ihe difference of lime in the clocks. A few minutes will make all the difference.

Afalse alibi will weaken the defence case and strengthen the prosecution case."

It is evident that there was a previous enmity between the I 51 deceased and the Accused-Appellant. Thereby there is a motive.

When considering the non-production of the Weapon I would like to draw the attention to the observation of Ranjith Silva, J. in Wallakku Aracllcllilage GUllapala V. Attomey Gelleral {2007/ J SLR 273

"1 hold that non-production of a material object is nol fatal 10 a conviction. The provisions of the Evidence Ordinance itseljhave made a clear distinction with regard to documentary evidence on the one hand and real evidence on the other. Section 91 of the Evidence Ordinance excludes parole evidence whereas section 60(1) and (2) of the Evidence Ordinance enacts that if the oral evidence refers to afact which could be seen or perceived by any other sense or in any other way, it must be the evidence of the witness who says that he saw or perceived thai fact by that sense or in that manner, that should be led to prove that facl, although the Court may, ifit thinks fit, require the production of such materialthingfor

its inspection, (Section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance) Thus the prosecution was entitled to lead oral evidence of a witness without producing the material object "

Therefore considering above I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed on the Accused-Appellant with regard to the 3rd charge of Murder and affirm the convictioT\5and sentences imposed on the Accused-Appellant with regard to the ISland the 2nd chargesof Murder.

Appeal is partly allowed.
