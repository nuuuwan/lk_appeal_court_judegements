Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the Order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which affirmed the decision

of the Public Service Commission to dismiss the Petitioner from service.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner had joined the Department of Railways (the Department) as a

Machinist on temporary basis in May 2007. By letter dated 17th December 2009

marked P2, the Petitioner had been appointed as a Technical Assistant III with

effect from 1st January 2009, and had been deployed to work at Workshop No. 42 of

the Department of Railways.

The Petitioner states that in October 2010, there was an incident where he was

assaulted by some employees after he refused to pay them money which they had

demanded from him. These persons had also threatened the Petitioner and stated

that they will ensure that the Petitioner will lose his job.

On 2nd November 2010, while removing a wheel of an engine outside Workshop No.

42, the Petitioner had been asked to report to Workshop No. 42 as the Flying Squad

of the Department had come in search of the Petitioner. The Petitioner admits that

the Officers, having introduced themselves, had searched his trouser pockets and

found one cigarette and an item rolled in a brown colour paper, which item had later

been determined to be cannabis. The Flying Squad had thereafter searched a locker

said to belong to the Petitioner and found a further two packets of cannabis.1 The

Officers had also found a red bag under another locker, which contained 24 packets

of cannabis. The Petitioner had thereafter been handed over to the Excise

Department, and produced before the Magistrates Court, Mount Lavinia.

The Petitioner had been charged in the Magistrates Court with possession of 46g of

cannabis, an offence punishable under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act.

I must observe that even though the cannabis had been found at three different

1 The cannabis found in the locker is said to have been rolled in a sheet of paper. For convenience, I shall refer to each lot of cannabis rolled in paper as a packet.

3

places, they had not been weighed separately. As a result, the prosecution had only

preferred one charge for the entire quantity. The Petitioner had been acquitted after

a lengthy trial where the Petitioner too had given evidence. I have examined the

judgment of the learned Magistrate delivered on 15th September 2015, and find that

the Petitioner had been acquitted as the prosecution had failed to establish that the

two lockers were in the exclusive possession of the Petitioner and thus, failed to

establish the exact quantity of cannabis that was said to have been found in the

trouser pocket of the Petitioner.

Simultaneous with the above prosecution, the Petitioner had been issued with a

charge sheet in 2012 by the Department. The charge sheet, marked P4, contained

the following seven charges:

1. Possession of one packet of cannabis (i.e. in relation to the cannabis said to

have been found in the trouser pocket);

2. Having two packets of cannabis in a locker belonging to the Petitioner;

3. Discovery of twenty four packets of cannabis inside a red bag on information

provided by the Petitioner;

4. Bringing to the premises of the Department, twenty seven packets of cannabis;

5. Bringing the Department to disrepute by engaging in the above acts;

6. Being a bad example to other employees of the Department by engaging in the

above acts;

7. Breaching the discipline of the Department by engaging in the above acts.

The learned Additional Solicitor General has submitted that possession of narcotic

drugs within Government premises is an offence under the First Schedule of

Offences of Volume II of the Establishments Code and that the Petitioner is liable to

be dismissed from service, if found guilty of the charges.

4

At the disciplinary inquiry that followed, the prosecution had led the evidence of

several Officers of the Flying Squad who had participated in the detection. The

Petitioner too had given evidence and had been cross examined. At the end of the

Inquiry, the Petitioner had been found guilty of all seven charges preferred against

him vide the report of the Inquiry Officer dated 27th June 2014, marked P7.

By letter dated 19th March 2015 marked P9, the General Manager, Sri Lanka

Railways had informed the Petitioner that he has been found guilty of all charges and

that his services have been terminated with immediate effect. The appeal of the

Petitioner to the Public Service Commission, marked P11 had been rejected and the

decision of the Public Service Commission had been conveyed to the Petitioner by

letter dated 26th August 2016, marked P12.

The Petitioner had thereafter appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by his

letter dated 23rd September 2016, marked P13. By letter dated 10th October 2016,

marked P14, the Public Service Commission had informed the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal that the Petitioner had been found guilty only of Charge Nos. I, II, V,

VI and VII, which was not the decision that was conveyed to the Petitioner by P12.

By a further letter dated 16th March 2017 marked P16, the Public Service

Commission had elaborated on the reasons for its findings. I have examined P16

and observe that the Petitioner had been exonerated of Charge No. III as the

cannabis found in the red bag was not in the exclusive possession of the Petitioner

and also due to the contradictions in the evidence between the witnesses for the

prosecution.

While P16 does not contain any reasons for exonerating the Petitioner from Charge

No. IV, the Public Service Commission, by a further letter dated 18th May 2017

marked P18 had informed the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that the Petitioner

was exonerated from Charge No. IV - i.e. bringing 24 packets of cannabis to the

workshop premises as the Petitioner has been found not guilty of Charge No. 3.

This is not entirely correct as Charge No. IV related to all 27 packets of cannabis that

formed the subject matter of all three charges, and was not limited to the 24 packets

that were found in the red bag.

5

By its Order dated 7th June 2018 marked P22, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

had dismissed the appeal of the Petitioner. Aggrieved by the said decision, the

Petitioner filed this application, seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

said Order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has challenged the decision of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal on three grounds. The first is that the Petitioner

cannot be found guilty of Charge Nos. I and II i.e. possession of one and two

packets, respectively, of cannabis - as the Petitioner has been exonerated of Charge

No. IV, namely bringing cannabis to the Department premises. While there is some

merit in this submission, it appears from P18 that the Public Service Commission

has proceeded on the basis that Charge No. IV relates only to Charge No. III. While

this is a factual mistake, it has in fact inured to the benefit of the Petitioner. Thus, I

see no merit in the first submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

The second ground urged by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal has failed to evaluate the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses and the evidence of the Petitioner with regard to the first two

charges. It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that even

though in its Order, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal has narrated the evidence

for the prosecution and the evidence of the Petitioner, it has failed to analyse the

evidence and/or consider the weaknesses in the evidence of the prosecution, but

had arrived at the conclusion that the Petitioner has rightly been found guilty of all

five charges. The third ground of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal has not given reasons for its decision. These two

grounds are connected and therefore I shall consider them together.

In terms of Section 4(1) of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No. 4 of 2002,

Any public officer or police officer as the case may be, aggrieved by an order or

decision made by the Public Service Commission or the National Police Commission,

as the case may be, may prefer an appeal in writing to the Tribunal within four weeks

from the date of receipt of such order or decision.

Section 4(2) provides that, An appeal preferred to the Tribunal under subsection (1),

shall set out concisely and precisely the grounds on which the aggrieved public officer

6

or police officer, as the case may be, seeks to have the order or decision against

which such appeal is being preferred altered, varied or rescinded and shall be signed

by such officer.

The fact that the Public Officer must set out the specific grounds on which he seeks

to have the order rescinded is a clear indication that the legislature required the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal to consider the said grounds in the light of the

findings of the Inquiry Officer and arrive at a finding based on the material that is

available to the members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. What this means is

that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal must pronounce a reasoned order or in

other words, give reasons for its decision.

In Karunadasa vs Unique Gem Stones Limited2 Mark Fernando, J held as follows:

To say that Natural Justice entitles a party to a hearing does not mean merely

that his evidence and submissions must be heard and recorded; it necessarily

means that he is entitled to a reasoned consideration of the case which he

presents. And whether or not the parties are also entitled to be told the reasons

for the decision, if they are withheld, once judicial review commences, the

decision "may be condemned as arbitrary and unreasonable"; certainly, the

Court cannot be asked to presume that they were valid reasons, for that would

be to surrender its discretion.

The duty to give reasons for a decision has been exhaustively dealt with by the

Supreme Court in Hapuarachchi and others v. Commissioner of Elections and

another3 where it was held as follows:

"Accordingly, an analysis of the attitude of the Courts since the beginning of the

20th century clearly indicates that despite the fact that there is no general duty

to give reasons for administrative decisions, the Courts have regarded the issue

in question as a matter affecting the concept of procedural fairness. Reasons for

an administrative decision are essential to correct any errors and thereby to

ensure that a person, who had suffered due to an unfair decision, is treated

2 [1997] 1 Sri L.R. 256. 3 [2009] 1 Sri L.R. 1.

7

according to the standard of fairness. In such a situation without a statement

from the person, who gave the impugned decision or the order, the decision

process would be flawed and the decision would create doubts in the minds of

the aggrieved person as well of the others, who would try to assess the validity

of the decision. Considering the present process in procedural fairness vis-a-vis,

right of the people, there is no doubt that a statement of reasons for an

administrative decision is a necessary requirement."

I must state that once reasons are given for a decision, it is not the function of this

Court, in exercising its writ jurisdiction to examine if the reasons are right or wrong.

Instead, the function of this Court would be to examine the legality and the

reasonableness of the decision, and ensure that the decision is supported by the

material that was available to the decision maker. As Lord Brightman stated in the

House of Lords in Chief Constable of North Wales Police v Evans4:

Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision

making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is observed,

the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the abuse of power, be

itself guilty of usurping power..... Judicial review, as the words imply, is not an

appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was

made.

I am of the view that this Court can consider the factual circumstances and the

evidence that was considered by the decision maker where an argument is

presented, as in this application, that the decision is unreasonable or irrational, or

where an argument is taken that there was no material at all to arrive at a decision,

resulting in an error on the face of the record.

Even in such cases, the Courts will only consider the factual circumstances to the

extent of determining whether the decision maker took into account relevant

considerations from the evidence placed before him, in making a decision. If a

decision has been influenced by considerations which either expressly or implicitly

cannot lawfully be taken into account, a Court may hold that such discretionary

power has not been exercised validly. The reasons provided for a decision would

4 [1982] 1 WLR 1155 at 1174.

8

therefore allow Courts to effectively scrutinize the decision and detect what factors

have influenced the decision maker.

As was said in Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department,5 although the

public authority may be better placed to investigate the facts and test the evidence,

the Court cannot abdicate its responsibility of ensuring that the facts are properly

explored, and summarised in the decision, with care, since they will always be

important and often decisive.6

A consideration of the second and third grounds urged by the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner requires me to consider whether the evidence that was led before the

Inquiry Officer, marked P6 in relation to Charge Nos. I and II was given due

consideration by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

As observed earlier, the prosecution had led the evidence of the Officers of the flying

squad who participated in the detection, namely Susil Chandrapala, Lanny Titus,

Ganepola and Jayasiri Silva. According to Chandrapala, the Flying Squad had received

information on 2nd November 2010 that an employee at Workshop No. 42 by the

name of Peiris is selling narcotic tablets to those who come for training from the

German Technical School. He had been directed to proceed to Workshop No. 42, and

carry out a search of the said person. He had accordingly proceeded to Workshop

No. 42 with the other three Officers.

Having gone there, Chandrapala had instructed the Foreman to summon the

Petitioner to his office. Once the Petitioner came to the office, either Chandrapala,

Titus or Silva had searched the Petitioner and found in the right side pocket of the

trouser worn by the Petitioner, a cigarette and a substance which was later

determined to be cannabis wrapped inside a sheet of paper. Chandrapala has

admitted in cross examination that the Petitioner was dressed in the working attire

of a light blue T-shirt and a gray or brown colour trouser. The cannabis that was said

to have been found from his trouser pocket formed the basis for Charge No. I at the

Disciplinary Inquiry.

5 [2007] UKHL 11 6 See Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review (8th Edition, Sweet & Maxwell 2018), page 649.

According to Chandrapala, they had thereafter proceeded to examine the locker of

the Petitioner. He states that the locker was opened by the Petitioner with a key that

was in the possession of the Petitioner, and that he found two packets of cannabis

inside the said locker.7 The position of Chandrapala that they found two packets of

cannabis in a locker to which the Petitioner had the key has been confirmed by

Titus.8 The two packets of cannabis found in the locker formed the basis for Charge

No. II.

However, the next witness for the prosecution, Sirisoma, who was not a member of

the Flying Squad, had stated that the locker to which the Petitioner had a key and

which was opened by the Petitioner, only contained the tools of the Petitioner. He

had stated that the Flying Squad had examined the locker next to that locker, which

had not been secured, and that the two packets of cannabis that formed the basis

for Charge No. II was found in that locker.

Thus, there is a contradiction between the versions of the witnesses for the

prosecution with regard to Charge No. II. The version of the Petitioner that the two

packets of cannabis were not found from his locker is therefore supported by the

evidence of Sirisoma. The Petitioner had specifically referred to this infirmity in his

petition of appeal marked P13,9 and in the submissions that he placed before the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal marked P17b.10

I have examined the Order of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and find that even

though the Order contains a narration of the version of the prosecution, and the

Petitioner, there has not been an evaluation of the positions of the parties with

regard to Charge No. II, nor has there been a consideration of the findings of the

Inquiry Officer in respect of Charge No. II. In my view, such an evaluation of the

evidence ought to have been done, for two reasons. The first is, the version of the

Petitioner is supported by a witness called by the prosecution. The second is, the

Petitioner has specifically raised this ground in his petition of appeal. Thus, I am of

the view that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal failed in its duty to evaluate the

7 Page 8 of P6. 8 Page 15 and 18 of P6. 9 Page 7 of P13. 10 Page 5 of P17b.

10

two different versions relating to Charge No. II, and failed to provide reasons for its

decision with regard to that charge. The decision of the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal with regard to Charge No. II is therefore liable to be quashed by a Writ of

Certiorari.

I shall now consider the evidence placed before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal

with regard to Charge No. I. In addition to the evidence of Chandrapala as to the

manner in which they found cannabis in the trouser pocket of the Petitioner, Titus

had given detailed evidence in this regard. He states that the Petitioner was attired in

a light blue collarless T-shirt and a black trouser at the time they checked the trouser

pockets of the Petitioner and found the cigarette and the cannabis. This is the

clothing that the Petitioner was attired in during work. Titus had been cross

examined on the clothing worn by the Petitioner and his position remained the

same, although he had later stated that he was not aware if the said clothing were

the working clothes of the Petitioner.

What is the position of the Petitioner with regard to Charge No. 1? The Petitioner

states that when he reported for work on that day, he was attired in a blue checked

long sleeve shirt and a brown colour trouser. He states further that once he reported

for duty, he changed into a blue T-shirt and a black trouser, as his work involves

working with machinery. According to the Petitioner, the clothes worn from home

are hung in a common area, which can be accessed by any person. The Petitioner

states that once he presented himself before Chandrapala, he was asked to change

his clothes, which he did, and that the search of the clothes worn by him took place

only thereafter. While the Petitioner admits that the Officers of the Flying Squad

found a cigarette and cannabis wrapped in a paper inside his trouser pocket, he

claims that the cigarette and the packet of cannabis have been introduced to his

personal clothing by someone who bore a grudge against him, and refers to the

incident that occurred in October of that year with other employees, which I have

referred to earlier. The position of the Petitioner had been suggested to Chandrapala

during cross examination, but Chandrapala had claimed that the Petitioner had been

with him at all times.11 The Petitioner has been cross examined on this aspect.

11 Pages 10 and 11 of P6.

11

With the version of the Petitioner being different to the version of the prosecution in

relation to Charge No. I, I agree with the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that it

was incumbent upon the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to consider (a) both

versions, (b) the findings of the Inquiry Officer, and arrive at a finding, with reasons

being provided for such finding. Unfortunately, that has not been done. The decision

of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with regard to Charge No. I is therefore liable

to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

In the above circumstances, I issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal marked P22. I direct the Administrative Appeals

Tribunal to consider the grounds of appeal submitted by the Petitioner in P13 and

the matters raised by the Petitioner in his written submissions, in the light of the

evidence led before the Inquiry Officer, the findings of the Inquiry Officer and the

observations of the Public Service Commission, and thereafter arrive at a

determination in terms of the law. I make no order with regard to costs.
