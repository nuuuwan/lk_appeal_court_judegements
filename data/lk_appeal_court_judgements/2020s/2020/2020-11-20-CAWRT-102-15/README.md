Decided on: 16.11.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners, who are farmers, filed this application seeking

writs of mandamus compelling the Mahaweli Authority of Sri

Lanka, the Central Environmental Authority of Sri Lanka and

the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development to enforce

the law against the 11th Respondent, to whom Lot 1083 of Final

Village Plan No. 663 was handed over on a long-term Lease

Agreement marked 11R3A for a Hotel project known as Forest

Rock Garden Hotel in Nochchiyagama, Anuradhapura. In

addition to the said parcel of land, by 1R1 the 11th Respondent

was also given Lot 1492 of the same Plan for a forest garden.

The Central Environmental Authority, in its statement of

objections, whilst accepting that it issued initial environmental

approval marked P19 of 2011 for the implementation of the

Hotel project, passes responsibility to the Board of Investment of

6

Sri Lanka, stating that this is a Board of Investment approved

project. However, the Central Environmental Authority, by

producing 5R1 and 5R2 of 2016, admits that the 11th

Respondent had not complied with condition D.2 of P19, in that

the Hotel premises did not have an adequate

wastewater/drainage treatment system in place, and therefore

the 11th Respondent was informed of the need to comply with

that requirement and obtain an Environmental Protection

Licence. The Central Environmental Authority then conveniently

says in its objections The 5th Respondent (i.e. the Central

Environmental Authority) has had no further communication (with

the 11th Respondent). Is this how the Central Environmental

Authority ought to act as a responsible institution? If the Board

of Investment should bear the entire responsibility, why did the

Central Environmental Authority issue P19, why did it

subsequently conduct a field inspection as reflected in 5R2, and

why did it issue 5R1 to the 11th Respondent informing the latter

to obtain an Environmental Protection Licence upon compliance

with the conditions in P19? P19, 5R1 and 5R2 do not seem to

have been issued at the behest of the Board of Investment.

The 11th Respondent tenders 11R5A issued by the Chairman,

Nochchiyagama Pradeshiya Sabha (on behalf of the Central

Environmental Authority) as the Environmental Protection

Licence. 11R5A has been issued in 2013 whereas 5R1 and 5R2

have been issued in 2016. The Licence marked 11R5A is in a

standard form, issued by filling some basic information

peremptorily.

This goes to show that either the position taken up by the

Central Environmental Authority that the Board of Investment

7

should issue the Environmental Protection Licence is false, or

11R5A is false or illegal.

One complaint of the Petitioners is that the 11th Respondent

releases wastewater and waste material to the Pahala Seeramba

Wewa. The Mahaweli Authority says the 11th Respondent has

not released wastewater, garbage or waste material to the

Seeramba Wewa and that there is no drain from the Hotel to the

Seeramba Wewa. However, the Mahaweli Authority is silent

about the Environmental Protection Licence that should have

been obtained by the 11th Respondent. The Mahaweli Authority

also does not say a proper wastewater/drainage treatment

system is in place at the Hotel. On the other hand, the

complaint of the Petitioners is that wastewater is released to the

Pahala Seeramba Wewa and not to the Ihala Seeramba Wewa.

The Mahaweli Authority seems to be referring to the latter.

The Commissioner General of Agrarian Development says in his

statement of objections that as the land is situated in a Special

Area declared under the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka Act,

he has no authority to take action against the 11th Respondent

in respect of this dispute. This position is correct in terms of

section 3 read with section 22 of the said Act. This is not

disputed by the Mahaweli Authority.

The main complaint of the Petitioners, in short, is that their

paddy cultivation is gravely affected due to the 11th

Respondents illegal constructions and encroachments into

areas not covered by the Lease Agreement.

The Petitioners engage in paddy cultivation with water from the

Ihala Seeramba Wewa and Pahala Seeramba Wewa in the

8

blocks of land given to them by the Mahaweli Authority by way

of Permits issued under the Land Development Ordinance.

According to the Petitioners, there are two reservoirs in close

proximity to the land leased out to the 11th Respondent for the

Hotel project. These are the Ihala Seeramba Wewa and Pahala

Seeramba Wewa. The Petitioners complaint mainly relates to

the damage caused to the Pahala Seeramba Wewa by the illegal

constructions of the 11th Respondent, particularly a well and

two-story building unlawfully constructed within the Pahala

Seeramba Wewa during the dry season of the year 2012, in

violation of inter alia the Lease Agreement. The complaints P13

and P14 etc. made to the Mahaweli Authority at the time of

these unlawful constructions have gone unheeded.

The Mahaweli Authority unequivocally accepts in its objections

the illegal constructions and encroachments of the 11th

Respondent but says in the same breath that according to the

Final Village Plan there is only one reservoir, i.e. Seeramba

Wewa, and the Petitioner farmers have constructed the Pahala

Seeramba Wewa using spill water from the (Ihala) Seeramba

Wewa by blocking the water canal using sandbag barriers.

Let me first deal with the second point, i.e. whether the

Mahaweli Authority has the right, in this instance, to point the

finger at the farmers to say the Pahala Seeramba Wewa is an

unauthorised reservoir, which, in my view, is done in order to

soften if not justify the 11th Respondents illegal activities. In my

judgment, the Mahaweli Authority cannot do so. If the Mahaweli

Authority thinks the Petitioners have done something illegal,

that shall be dealt with separately.

9

Although the Mahaweli Authority takes up the position that the

Pahala Seeramba Wewa is not shown in the Final Village Plan,

the Commissioner General of Agrarian Development admits in

the supporting affidavit filed along with the objections the

farmers over the years had expanded and developed a dam that

existed near a sluice gate (wana) and had created the smaller

reservoir now known as the Kuda Seeramba Wewa. This

reservoir now irrigates over 6 acres of paddy land. This means,

even if the Pahala Seeramba Wewa is not depicted in the Final

Village Plan, it has been in existence for a long period of time,

irrigating over six acres of paddy land. This is in addition to the

paddy cultivation on a larger extent of land with water from the

Ihala Seeramba Wewa. By looking at photographs such as

11R12, it cannot be said the dam constructed to make the

Pahala Seeramba Wewa is either temporary or of recent origin.

The Commissioner General of Agrarian Development has

attached to his statement of objections an Inspection Report

marked 8R1 prepared by an engineer. As seen from 8R1, the

said inspection was carried out in view of this case. The

observations made therein are revealing. They are reproduced

verbatim below:

5. X WXY X > ` dZ e+, 9 #%

It appears from these observations that the 11th Respondent

removed some parts of the sluice gate/dam of the Pahala

Seeramba Wewa to reduce the water level by 50% in order to

accommodate its (11th Respondents) unlawful constructions.

The well has been illegally constructed in the Pahala Seeramba

Wewa to pump water from the well to the illegally constructed

two-story building, as seen from the six photographs marked

P112.

The Mahaweli Authority categorically admits in its objections

that the said two-story building and the well (constructed

without prior approvals) are illegal but says inter alia in 1R2

X =+ W + 5 #% f

The 11th Respondent and the Mahaweli Authority seem to be

saying that because of the sandbag barriers placed by the

farmers, the two-story building (where the Staff Quarters and

Library are located) and the well are submerged in water. I

reject this line of argument in the strongest terms. The Pahala

Seeramba Wewa was not built after the unlawful constructions

of the 11th Respondent.

As I pointed out earlier, the Commissioner General of Agrarian

Services observed that the sluice gate/dam of the Pahala

Seeramba Wewa has been damaged, causing a reduction in the

11

water retention capacity of the wewa by 50%. Who did it and

why it was done are abundantly clear. In this backdrop, the

farmers mending the dam by at least fixing sandbags in order to

continue their paddy cultivation is, in my view, justifiable. If the

farmers had placed sandbag barriers and created a wewa for the

first time after the aforesaid constructions of the 11th

Respondent, I would have thought differently. But the Pahala

Seeramba Wewa was in existence when the illegal constructions

saw the light of day, nay when the Hotel project was conceived

by the 11th Respondent. Before the Hotel project commenced,

the Mahaweli Authority never alleged that the Petitioner farmers

had done something illegal by artificially constructing a wewa

and thereby posing a serious threat to the ancient Ihala

Seeramba Wewa.

The Mahaweli Authority says in paragraph 12 of its statement of

objections inter alia:

[a] The 11th Respondent has constructed the well and two

storied building outside the land alienated by the long-

term Lease, within a part of the said Seeramba Wewa;

[b] The 11th Respondent has not obtained any permission

from the 1st Respondent for use of the said land area or

for such constructions;

[c] The 11th Respondent has illegally cleared another land

area outside the land alienated for the hotel using heavy

machines in pretext of preparation of compost;

[d] The 11th Respondent has not obtained permission from

the 1st Respondent for occupation of such land other

12

than the land alienated by the long-term Lease marked

11R3A and such clearing is illegal;

[e] The said usage of any land within the Mahaweli H Zone,

other than the land alienated by long-term Lease and

annual licence, is illegal and the said constructions of

two stories building and the well are illegal;

[f] The 11th Respondent is liable for ejectment under the

provisions of the State Land (Recovery of Possession)

Act;

In paragraph 13 of the said objections, the Mahaweli Authority

says:

[a] The clause 7 of the Regulations framed under sections

54(1) and 54(2) of the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka

Act No.23 of 1979 dated 10th December 1976 state

Clause 7 Buildings and Structures

(a) No person shall engage in the construction of a

building or structure below the high flood level of a

reservoir without prior permission of the Authorised

Officer.

(b) No person shall engage in the construction or

provision of buildings and structures in and around a

reservoir without prior approval of an Authorised

Officer and in the construction carried out after

approval to conform to such terms and conditions laid

out in the approval.

13

[b] The word Reservoir is defined in the said Regulations

in the following manner.

Reservoir means an expanse of water resulting from

manmade constructions across a river or stream to store

or regulate water. Its environs will include that area

extending to a distance of 100m from full supply level of

the reservoir inclusive of all islands falling within the

reservoir.

[c] The said construction of the building and the well is

contrary to the provisions of the said Regulations.

By mutual agreement entered into before Court, the Mahaweli

Authority surveyed the land given to the 11th Respondent on

long-term Lease through the Government Surveyor at the 11th

Respondents expense. The said Plan and Report have been

marked Y1 and Y2, and the encroached portions and

unauthorised constructions are identified therein. The well and

two-story building have been identified as H and J in Y2. The

other unauthorised structures have been marked K and L. In

addition, the unlawful encroachments have been marked B-G.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Mahaweli Authority has

informed the Court that there is no provision in the Mahaweli

Authority Act to regularise unauthorised constructions in

Special Areas declared under the Act. Even if it were possible,

the time has now passed for such measures to be taken.

Section 13(34) of the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka Act enacts

Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law and without

prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred on the

Authority by this Act, the Authority shall in or in relation to any

14

Special Area have the power to take all such steps as are

necessary for the general welfare of the community in any Special

Area.

No sustainable defence has been presented by the 11th

Respondent in its statement of objections.

For the aforesaid reasons, I direct the Mahaweli Authority by a

writ of mandamus to take steps to remove all the unlawful

structures shown in Y2 marked H, J, K and L, including the well

and two-story building mentioned above.

I also direct the Mahaweli Authority by a writ of mandamus to

take steps to either include the encroached portions shown in

Y2 in the Lease Agreement or eject the 11th Respondent from

those portions of land, as the Mahaweli Authority has suggested

in its statement of objections, by making use of the provisions of

the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

In addition, I direct the Mahaweli Authority by a writ of

mandamus to take steps to ensure the 11th Respondent has a

proper Environmental Protection Licence and that the 11th

Respondent has complied with the directions given by the

Central Environmental Authority by 5R1.

This does not prevent the Mahaweli Authority from taking action

against the Petitioners, if, after a proper inquiry with the

participation of the Petitioners, the Mahaweli Authority decides

that the Petitioners constructed the Pahala Seeramba Wewa in

violation of the law.

15

I allow the application of the Petitioners with costs fixed at Rs.

100,000 to be paid by the 11th Respondent to the three

Petitioner farmers collectively.
