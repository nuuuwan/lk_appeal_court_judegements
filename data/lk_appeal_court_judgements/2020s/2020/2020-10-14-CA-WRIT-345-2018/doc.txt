Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order dated 12th June 2018 marked X8 made by

the 2nd 6th Respondents, who are the Chairman and members of the Debt

Conciliation Board, respectively, by which it was held that Deed No. 7470 executed

by the Petitioner in favour of the 1st Respondent is not a mortgage but a transfer;

(b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 2nd 6th Respondents to issue a notice in favour

of the Petitioner in terms of Section 25 of the Debt Conciliation Ordinance No. 39

of 1941, as amended (the Ordinance).

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner states that by Deed No. 7570 dated 10th April 1993, she and her husband

purchased a land situated in Galle, in extent of approximately 5 acres, for a sum of Rs.

200,000.1 The Petitioner admits that her husband transferred his share of the land to

1 A copy of the said Deed has been marked R3.

her by Deed No. 8444 on 28th June 1994, and that the value declared therein was Rs.

100,000, but states that the transfer was done to enable her to apply for a loan. The

Petitioner states that she obtained a loan from the Ruhuna Development Bank in a sum

of Rs. 300,000 for the development of the said land and that she cultivated the entire

land with Cinnamon. The Petitioner has produced a copy of the Inspection Report

prepared by the Bank in July 1994, which values an acre of land at Rs. 160,000. The said

report also states that, fuu foamf,ys uqukskau l+reoq j.djka mj;S' ;ju;a b;d l=vd me, w;r w;=re j.djka f,io fmd,a ;jdklao we;' jsoq,sh foam, wi,skau hk nejskao P,myiqjo

iys; nejska wla' 01 l jgskdlu re' 160"000 la muK jk f,i ;lafiare lrk ,oS'

In 1998, the Petitioner had obtained a further loan of Rs. 500,000 from the same Bank,

as security for which she had once again mortgaged the said land in favour of the Bank.2

The Petitioner admits that due to financial difficulties faced by her, she defaulted in the

payment of the loan. By letter dated 5th June 2000,3 the Bank had informed her that

unless steps are taken to pay the sum in default, the Bank would be compelled to sell

the land by public auction. The Petitioner has produced the resolution passed by the

Bank in terms of the Recovery of Loans (Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1990, published

in Gazette No. 1201 dated 7th September 2001. By the said resolution, the Bank was

seeking to recover a sum of Rs. 574,546.65 being the capital and interest outstanding as

at 20th November 2000, together with interest on a sum of Rs. 421,300 from 20th

November 2000 at the rate of 26% per annum until the date of the auction. The fact

that the resolution had been published in September 2001 confirms the fact that even

as at that date, the loan was in default, and the sums of money referred to therein,

were due from the Petitioner.

The Petitioner states that having been unsuccessful in finding a buyer to sell the

property, she had obtained a loan from the 1st Respondent in a sum of Rs. 650,000, and

thereafter settled the outstanding sums due to the Bank. It is not in dispute that the 1st

Respondent is engaged in the trading of cinnamon and that he used to purchase from

the Petitioner the cinnamon that was produced on the said land. The Petitioner admits

2 The extracts issued by the Land Registry depicting the above transactions have been marked A7. 3 The said letter had been marked as A1 at the Inquiry before the Debt Conciliation Board.

4

that she signed a Deed of Transfer in favour of the Petitioner before an Attorney-at-Law,

who she claims is a relative of the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner states that the

understanding of the parties was that she was only signing the document as security for

the loan, and for that reason, the Deed was not meant to be submitted for registration.

The Petitioner admits that she handed over possession of the said land to the 1st

Respondent pursuant to the said transaction, but states that was done to enable the 1st

Respondent to peel the cinnamon and obtain the income as interest for the loan, until

such time she was able to repay the loan and obtain possession of the said land.

The Petitioner states that once she had sufficient resources to settle the loan, she had

contacted the 1st Respondent, only to be told that she must pay him a sum of Rs. 1.2

million if she wanted possession of the land.

In October 2004, the Petitioner made an application to the Debt Conciliation Board in

terms of Section 14(1) of the Ordinance. The purpose of a debtor making such an

application in terms of Section 14(1) is to seek the assistance of the Debt Conciliation

Board to effect a settlement of the debt/s owed by such debtor to his/her secured

creditor/s.

The Debt Conciliation Board, comprising of the 2nd 6th Respondents, having issued

notices on the 1st Respondent, proceeded to conduct a preliminary hearing as provided

for by Section 24 of the Ordinance. It is admitted that the Petitioner and the 1st

Respondent were afforded the opportunity of giving evidence, the right to summon

witnesses of their choice and to produce documentary evidence in support of their

respective cases. At the conclusion of this preliminary hearing, the 2nd 6th

Respondents, by decision dated 12th June 2018 annexed to the petition marked X8,

held that the Petitioner has not established that the transfer was conditional, and

therefore rejected the application of the Petitioner.

It is in the above factual circumstances that the Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of

this Court seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said Order marked X8.

5

In considering the arguments advanced on behalf of the Petitioner, I am mindful that

this Court is exercising its Writ jurisdiction as opposed to its Appellate jurisdiction, and

that this Court is not concerned with the rights and wrongs of the decision sought to be

impugned but only whether the said decision is legal or not.

This distinction has been referred to in Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth4 in the

following manner:

"The system of judicial review is radically different from the system of appeals.

When hearing an appeal the court is concerned with the merits of a decision: is it

correct? When subjecting some administrative act or order to judicial review, the

court is concerned with its legality: is it within the limits of the powers granted? On

an appeal the question is right or wrong?' On review the question is lawful or

unlawful?

As Lord Brightman stated in the House of Lords in Chief Constable of North Wales

Police v Evans,5 Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision

making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is observed, the court

will in my view, under the guise of preventing the abuse of power, be itself guilty of

usurping power6..... Judicial review, as the words imply, is not an appeal from a

decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was made..7

In Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service,8 Lord Diplock stated

that, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon which

administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground I would call

'illegality', the second 'irrationality' and the third 'procedural impropriety'. He then

went onto state that, By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the

decision maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making

power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable

4 H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, Administrative Law (11th Edition), Oxford University at page 26. 5 [1982] 1 WLR 1155. 6 Ibid. p 1173. 7 Ibid. p 1174. 8 1985 AC 374

question to be decided in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom

the judicial power of the state is exercisable.

As the Ordinance is silent with regard to the manner in which the Debt Conciliation

Board should act when considering an application under Section 14, I would like to

consider parallel situations that exist in other laws.

The Supreme Court, in the context of the role of an arbitrator under the Industrial

Disputes Act which requires the arbitrator to arrive at a decision which is just and

equitable,9 held in Singer Industries (Ceylon) Limited vs Ceylon Mercantile Industrial

and General Workers Union and Others10 that:

It is a cardinal principle of law that in making an award by an arbitrator there

must be a judicial and objective approach and more importantly the perspectives

both of employer as well as the employee should be considered in a balanced

manner and undoubtedly just and equity must apply to both these parties.

In Heath and Company (Ceylon) Limited vs P. Kariyawasam and Others,11 the Supreme

Court held that in the assessment of evidence, an arbitrator appointed under the

Industrial Disputes Act must act judicially. Where his finding is completely contrary to

the weight of the evidence led before him, such a finding can only be described as being

perverse and his award is liable to be quashed by way of Certiorari.

In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union v. Nestle Lanka Limited,12 this

Court held as follows:

The arbitrator to whom a reference has been made in terms of section 4 (1) of the

Industrial Disputes Act as amended is expected to act judicially. He is required in

arriving at his determinations to decide legal questions affecting the rights of the

9 Vide Section 17(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act. 10 [2010] 1 Sri LR 66 at page 84. 11 71 NLR 382 12 [1999] 1 Sri LR 343 at page 348.

7

subject and hence he is under a duty to act judicially. Although such arbitrator does

not exercise judicial power in the strict sense, it is his duty to act judicially.

It has been stressed that such an arbitrator's function is judicial in the sense that he

has to hear parties, decide facts, apply rules with judicial impartiality and his

decision is objective as that of any court of law, though ultimately he makes such

award as may appear to him to be just and equitable.13

An arbitrator under the Industrial Disputes Act must arrive at a decision which may

appear to him just and equitable. The arbitrator must act judicially. Similarly, given the

fact that the Debt Conciliation Board is determining the rights of parties, I am of the

view that the Board must act judicially when considering an application under Section

14. Although the Ordinance does not impose a duty on the Board to arrive at a decision

which is just and equitable, I am of the view that the rationale laid down in the above

judgments would apply to decisions of the Board, especially since the purpose of making

an application to the Board is to attempt to bring about a settlement between the

debtor and creditor. In fact, the Supreme Court in Dharmasiri Karunaratne and Another

v. The Debt Conciliatian Board and Others14 has held that, It is quite obvious that the

Board has to weigh the question at hand on the weighing balance of reasonableness.

The string that binds the provisions in each Section is nothing but reasonableness.

I must observe that the Petitioner is not challenging the power of the Debt Conciliation

Board to make such an order nor is the Petitioner challenging the said order on the basis

that there has been any impropriety with regard to the conduct of the proceedings

before the Debt Conciliation Board. The primary submission of the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner is that the Debt Conciliation Board failed to consider the totality of the

evidence presented to it, as required by Section 21A of the Ordinance, and that this

failure amounts to an error on the face of the record, and renders the said decision

illegal.

Section 21A of the Ordinance, which reads as follows, sets out the framework within

which the Debt Conciliation Board must decide whether a conditional transfer of

immovable property is in reality a mortgage.

In any proceedings under this Ordinance in regard to an application relating to a

transfer or conditional transfer of immovable property, the Board shall,

notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 2 of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance, or sections 91 and 92 of the Evidence Ordinance and for the purpose of

deciding whether or not such transfer or conditional transfer is in reality a

mortgage, take into consideration all the circumstances of the case and in

particular the following matters:

(a) the language of the notarial instrument of transfer and where provision in

regard to the right of the transferor or any other person to redeem or

purchase the property transferred is contained in any other notarial

instrument, the language of that other instrument;

(b) any difference between the sum received by the transferor from the

transferee and the value of the property transferred;

(c) the continuance of the transferor's possession of the property transferred;

and

(d) the existence of any agreement in whatever form between the transferor and

the transferee whereby the transferor is bound to pay the transferee interest,

or any sum which may reasonably be considered to be interest, on the sum

received by the transferor from the transferee.

In my view, Section 21A makes it clear that the Debt Conciliation Board must consider all

the circumstances of the case before them, and that while the Board must consider in

particular the four specific matters set out in Section 21A, it cannot limit itself to a

consideration of the said four matters. This to my mind is reflective of the principle in

Administrative Law that a decision maker must take into consideration all relevant

9

matters. The four matters set out therein are factors which the legislature has thought

important in determining whether a transfer is in effect a mortgage, but, by the use of

the words, take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, the legislature has

made it clear that the decision of the Board cannot be limited to a consideration and

determination of only those four matters. The Board has been empowered to conduct

an inquiry, hear the witnesses, and consider documents not for it to then engage in an

exercise of ticking off a check list and arriving at a decision based on the number of

rights or wrongs they give to the four matters set out in Section 21A(a) (d). That to my

mind, is not acting judicially.

The learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent has drawn the attention of this Court to the

following paragraph in Niroshana and Another v. Gunasekera and Another:15

When interpreting a section, the entire section has to be considered to construe

the meaning of the section and every word in the section has to be considered and

effect should be given to those words in interpreting the section as the legislature

has intentionally included those words for good reasons.

I agree that this is exactly what the Debt Conciliation Board was required to do.

The learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent has quite correctly pointed out in his written

submissions that the use of the words, in particular in Section 21A means that the

legislature has placed emphasis on those four matters. That is precisely the intention of

the legislature. It has been further submitted on behalf of the 1st Respondent that the

use of the words, take into consideration all the circumstances of the case means that

the matters set out in paragraphs (a) (d) of Section 21A are not exhaustive, and that

the Board can exercise its discretion to expand the provisions set out therein but not

limit its application. I am in agreement with this submission as this is precisely what the

legislature requires the Board to do.

15 [2006] 3 Sri LR 152 at page 159.

10

Is it mandatory that all four, or for that matter, any one of the matters set out in

paragraphs (a) (d) of Section 21A should be established for an applicant to succeed?

The fact that an applicant has led evidence in respect of the said four matters, and the

fact that an applicant has discharged the burden cast on an applicant by Section 21A(2)

would most certainly strengthen his/her application and would enable the Board to

make a decision in the applicants favour. Similarly, the failure on the part of an

applicant to establish one or more of those matters may make an application weaker.

However, that does not mean that an application must be mandatorily dismissed for

failure to establish one or more of the four matters set out in paragraphs (a) (d) of

Section 21A. In other words, it is not mandatory that one or more of the four matters

must be established for an applicant to succeed. While I agree that these factors carry

more weight, and that they require special consideration, I am of the view that they

must be viewed in light of all the circumstances of the case. This is where the Board

must act judicially and arrive at a decision which is both objective and reasonable.

It is in the above background that I have examined the Order of the Board marked X8

in order to ascertain if the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is borne

out by the Order.

The relevant parts of the decision of the Board are re-produced below:

analyse the material placed by the Petitioner as the matters set out in paragraphs (a), (c)

and (d) of Section 21A had not been satisfied. Therefore, it appears that the Board was

in fact engaged in an exercise of ticking boxes. Quite apart from contradicting the

sentence right thereafter that the Board considered all the facts (jsuisfusos bosrsm;a jq

lreKq iuia:hla f,i i,ld n,d), to my mind, the Board has lost sight of the fact that the

Ordinance requires it to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case, and

not only the particular matters set out in paragraphs (a) (d) of Section 21A.

It is true that of the four matters set out in paragraphs (a) (d) of Section 21A, the

Petitioner has only placed documentary material with regard to the value. The Board

has however not considered the fact that at least paragraph (d) does not require any

documentary proof. All that is required is for the applicant to satisfy the existence of any

agreement in whatever form between the transferor and the transferee whereby the

transferor is bound to pay the transferee interest, or any sum which may reasonably be

considered to be interest. The explanation of the Petitioner in this regard, although

referred to in X8, has not been considered in the context of the entire transaction.

Although the Board has referred to the Valuation Report submitted by the Petitioner, it

has failed to consider the Inspection Report prepared in 1994 at the time the Petitioner

12

applied for a loan of Rs. 300,000, which gives the value of the said land as at 1994. Nor

has there been a consideration of the Valuation Report submitted by the Petitioner,

except a passing reference. It is my view that the Board ought to have engaged itself in

analysing the material presented by the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent with regard

to the value, as such an analysis has an impact on the position of the Petitioner as to the

circumstances in which she engaged in the transaction with the 1st Respondent.

The Board has referred to the fact that possession of the land has been handed over by

the Petitioner to the 1st Respondent. That is admitted by the Petitioner and there is no

dispute. However, except to state that j.W;a;rlre fmd<sh jYfhka l=re|q bvfus wdodhu

,nd .ekSug tl jS we;' ta wkqj nexl=fjs Wli ksoyia lr f.k we;, the Board has failed

to analyse the position of the Petitioner as to what necessitated her to hand over

possession of the land, in the overall context of the story of the Petitioner.

Although the Board has referred to the version of the Petitioner as to why she engaged

in the impugned transaction, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner has pointed out that

there has not been a consideration of the fact as to why the Petitioner would sell the

said land for Rs. 650,000 when the sums due to the Bank by then was Rs. 574,540,

together with interest at 26% on a sum of Rs. 421,300 for almost a year. In other words,

the position of the Petitioner as to why she would want to redeem the mortgage, if she

was not receiving any monies over and above what was due to the Bank, is a matter that

in my view, required consideration.

The consequence of not taking into consideration all the circumstances as required by

the Ordinance, or in other words, disregarding relevant considerations, has been

captured in the following two paragraphs of De Smiths Judicial Review:16

When exercising a discretionary power a decision-maker may take into account a

range of lawful considerations. Some of these are specified in the statute as

matters to which regard may be had. Others are specified as matters to which

16 Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review [8th Edition, 2018] Sweet and Maxwell.

13

regard may not be had. There are other considerations which are not specified but

which the decision-maker may or may not lawfully take into account. If the exercise

of discretionary power has been influenced by considerations that cannot lawfully

be taken into account, or by the disregard of relevant considerations required to be

taken into account (expressly or impliedly), a court will normally hold that the

power has not been validly exercised.17

If the ground of challenge is that relevant considerations have not been taken into

account, the court will normally try to assess the actual or potential importance of

the factor that was overlooked, even though this may entail a degree of

speculation. The question is whether the validity of the decision is contingent on

strict observance of antecedent requirements. In determining what factors may or

must be taken into account by the authority, the courts are again faced with

problems of statutory interpretation. If relevant factors are specified in the

enabling Act it is for the courts to determine whether they are factors to which the

authority is compelled to have regard.18

While I am mindful that it is not my duty to analyse the facts as would be done when

exercising appellate jurisdiction, I am also mindful that, as stated by Lord Bingham, that

they (judges) are auditors of legality; no more, but no less.19 Viewed from that context,

can it be said that the Debt Conciliation Board has performed the role conferred on it by

Section 21A of the Ordinance, and taken into consideration all the circumstances of the

case? I do not think so. As stated by Lord Diplock, the Board ought to have understood

correctly the law that regulates its decision making power and given effect to it. In these

circumstances, I am of the view that failure to do so renders X8 liable to be quashed by

a Writ of Certiorari.

That being my conclusion on the principal issue urged before this Court by the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner, I would now like to consider the submission of the learned

Counsel for the 1st Respondent that the Petitioner has an alternative remedy in terms of

17 Ibid; page 305. 18 Ibid; page 306-307. 19Tom Bingham, The Rule of Law [2011] Penguin Books at page 61.

14

Section 54 of the Ordinance which the Petitioner has not invoked, and that this Court

should therefore refrain from exercising its discretion in this matter.

Section 54(1) of the Ordinance reads as follows:

"The Board may, of its own motion or on application made by any person

interested, within three months from the making of an order by the Board

dismissing an application, or granting a certificate, or approving a settlement, or

before the payment of the compounded debt has been completed, review any

order passed by it and pass such other in reference thereto as it thinks fit.

It has been held in several judgments delivered by this Court as well as by the Supreme

Court that a Writ will not lie if (a) an alternative remedy (b) which is equally effective is

available to the Petitioner. The alternative remedy that is generally spoken of is where

there is a right of appeal to a body established by law, which is a body other than the

body that issued the order that is impugned.

The rationale for this rule has been explained in Judicial Review of Administrative

Action20 in the following manner:

"Where there is an alternative procedure which will provide the applicant with a

satisfactory remedy the courts will usually insist on an applicant exhausting that

remedy before seeking judicial review. In so doing the court is coming to a

discretionary decision."21

"Where there is a choice of another separate process outside the courts, a true

question for the exercise of discretion exists. For the court to require the alternative

procedure to be exhausted prior to resorting to judicial review is in accord with

judicial review being properly regarded as being a remedy of last resort. It is

important that the process should not be clogged with unnecessary cases which are

perfectly capable of being dealt with in another tribunal. It can also be the situation

20 De Smith, Woolf and Jowell, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (5th Edition, 1995), Sweet & Maxwell. 21 Ibid; page 813.

15

that Parliament, by establishing an alternative procedure, indicated either

expressly or by implication that it intends that procedure to be used. In exercising

its discretion the court will attach importance to the indication of Parliament's

intention."22

In Niroshana and Another v. Gunasekera and Another23 it was held that as the

petitioners did not challenge the order on the issue of the certificate of non-settlement

before the Debt Conciliation Board under Section 54 of the Ordinance, that they have

not exhausted an effective alternate remedy, and hence cannot challenge the said order

in that application.

In Halwan and Others v. Kaleelul Rahuman24, the petitioners had sought a Writ of

certiorari to quash an order made by the Wakfs Board. An objection was taken that in

terms of the Muslim Mosque and Charitable Trusts or Wakfs Act, No. 51 of 1956 (as

amended), a right of appeal is available to this Court from the said order and as the

petitioners have in fact sought to exercise that right of appeal, the application for the

Writ of Certiorari could not be maintained.

Justice Sarath Silva (as he then was) upheld the above argument, having held as follows:

A party dissatisfied with a judgment or order, where a right of appeal is given

either directly or with leave obtained, has to invoke and pursue the appellate

jurisdiction. When such party seeks judicial review by way of an application for a

writ, as provided in Article 140 of the Constitution he has to establish an excuse for

his failure to invoke and pursue the appellate jurisdiction. Such excuse should be

pleaded in the petition seeking judicial review and be supported by affidavit and

necessary documents. In any event, where such a party has failed to invoke

and pursue the appellate jurisdiction the extraordinary jurisdiction by way of

review will be exercised only in exceptional circumstances such as, where the

court, tribunal or other institution has acted without jurisdiction or contrary to the

22 Ibid; page 814. 23 Supra. 24 [2000] (3) Sri LR 50 at page 61.

principles of natural justice resulting in an order that is void. The same principle is

in my view applicable to instances where the law provides for a right of appeal

from a decision or order of an institution or an officer, to a statutory tribunal.

The question whether the Writ jurisdiction of this Court could be exercised where there

is an alternative remedy available was also considered by this Court in J.H.S Jayamaha

vs Provincial Public Service Commission (North Western Province) and Others.25 After

a careful consideration of the relevant authorities, it was held as follows:

However, as it is a general principle, Courts have recognized several qualifications

in its application. There may be situations where the alternative remedy is not

adequate and efficacious in which event judicial review is available26. It maybe that

judicial review is capable of providing immediate means of resolving the dispute in

which case it may be the more appropriate procedure. There may also be a need to

obtain interim relief which may not be possible under the alternative procedure.

This is not an exhaustive list and there are certainly other instances where judicial

review may be granted even though an alternative administrative procedure

exists.

In Wickremasinghage Francis Kulasooriya and Another vs Officerin-Charge, Police

Station, Kirindiwela and Others,27 this Court held as follows:

The question that arises for consideration in this application is what should a

Court exercising Writ jurisdiction do, when confronted with an argument that an

alternative remedy is available to the Petitioner and that such alternative remedy

should be resorted to? This Court is of the view that a rigid principle cannot be laid

down and that the appropriate decision would depend on the facts and

circumstances of each case. That said, where the statute provides a specific

alternative remedy, a person dissatisfied with a decision of a statutory body should

pursue that statutory remedy instead of invoking a discretionary remedy of this

25 CA(PHC)No. 188/2014; CA Minutes of 5th July 2018 per Justice Janak De Silva. 26 E.S. Fernando v. United Workers Union and another (1989) 2 Sri L.R. 199. 27 CA (Writ) Application No. 338/09; CA Minutes of 22nd October 2018.

Court. That remedy should be equally effective and should be able to prevent an

injustice that a Petitioner is seeking to avert. Furthermore, if the Writ jurisdiction is

invoked where an equally effective remedy is available, an explanation should be

offered as to why that equally effective remedy has not been resorted to.

I do agree that the Petitioner could have invited the Board to review their decision in

terms of Section 54. However, I am not inclined to refrain from granting relief solely due

to the failure on the part of the Petitioner to resort to Section 54, for three reasons. The

first is, for the reasons already discussed, the decision of the Board is illegal. The second

is, what is provided for by Section 54 is not a right of appeal, which means that there

will not be a re-consideration of all the facts during the review stage, unlike in an

appeal. The third reason follows the second. I have my doubts whether Section 54 is an

effective alternative remedy. In my view, the effectiveness of the remedy provided by

Section 54 is dependent on the grievance of the Petitioner. Where the power of review

is limited to the Order already made, I have my doubts whether the Board can re-visit

the circumstances that were not considered in the Order, or in other words, act like how

an appellate body would do, and re-consider all the circumstances, thereby addressing

the grievance of the Petitioner.

Furthermore, the Petitioner has, although only in her counter affidavit, pointed out that

her husband has been sick since 2013 and that this prevented her from exercising her

right of appeal. She has produced the diagnosis ticket marked X16 which shows that

her husband has been discharged from hospital on 10th June 2018, which is two days

before X8 was delivered. However, there are no medical records to demonstrate that

the Petitioners husband received treatment after X8 was delivered.

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, and the fact that the Writ of

Certiorari is a discretionary remedy, I am not obliged to automatically dismiss this

application owing to the failure on the part of the Petitioner to act in terms of Section

54. I am of the view that the interests of justice demand that I should exercise the

discretion vested in this Court in favour of the Petitioner.

I accordingly issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order of the Debt Conciliation Board

marked X8. I direct the Chairman and Members of the Board to re-consider the

evidence already placed before the Board by the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent, take

into consideration all the circumstances of the case and in particular the matters set

out in paragraphs (a) (d) of Section 21A and arrive at a decision in terms of Section

21A of the Ordinance. I make no order with regard to costs.
