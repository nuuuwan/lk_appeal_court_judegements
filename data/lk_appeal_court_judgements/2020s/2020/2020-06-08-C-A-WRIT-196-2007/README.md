.Respondents

Manohara De Silva P.e. with Pubudini Wickremaratne and Hirosha Munsainghe for the

Petitioners

ManoharaJayasinghe SSC for the Respondents

Argued On: 13.05.2019

Page 19 of 30

Written Submissions Filed On :

Petitioner on 07.01.2019

Respondents on 27.06.2019

Decided On: 29.05.2020

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioners are residents of Ampara whose family has been in occupation of the land in

issue for over three decades. They claim th at th e said land is over one acre in extent and since

there was no proper irrigation system in place, paddy cultivation was carried out only once a

year during the rainy season.

The name of the Petitioners mother S.M Karunawathie has been inserted as the owner of the

said land in the relevant Agricultural Land Register in 1978 (A2) although this is questionable

given that the land in dispute is state land.

In or about 1992, the Petitioner's mother S.M. Karunawathie applied for a permit for the said

land (A3) and requested that it be divided among her four children including the two

Petitioners. According to the decision of the Provincial Minister of Rehabilitation and Social

Welfare of the Eastern Province, since the land in dispute is not a paddy land only married

children were eligible to a grant of 25 perches of the said land. Accordingly, the Petitioners and

a brother of theirs namely Hewa Gajanayakage Anura were eligible to receive permits.

Thereafter the 2,d Petitioner was informed by letter dated 27.06.1992 (A4A) that a survey was

needed in order to divide the said land between S.M. Karunawathie and her three children and

called upon them to pay the survey fees of Rs. 4500/= which was done (A4B). Thereafter, the

land in dispute was surveyed and lots 498, 499 and 500 of Cadastral Map 280003 (AS) was

allocated to the Petitioners and their broth er Hewa Gajanayake Anura respectively

(A6).Accordingly, the Petitioners and their brother, Hewa Gajanayake Anura had been issued

with annual permits in respect of the said lands (A7A and A7El). The permits of the pt Petitioner

and Hewa Gajanayake Anura was extended <Jnnually until 2002 while the annual permit of the

Page 20 of 30

2nd Petitioner was extended until 2003 (A8A to 118C). Thereafter, the Petitioners applied for a

long term lease.

In 2003 the 1st Petitioner was informed by the 2nd Respondent that a decision had been made

to grant to the Urban Development Authority (UDA) the land to which he was given an annual

permit (A9). The Petitioners and their brother Hewa Gajanayake Anura appealed (AlO and All)

and later the UDA informed the 5th Respondent on 17.11.2004 (A12) that none of the lands in

respect of which the Divisional Secretary of Ampara had issued permits have been acquired

and/or recommended for acquisition by the UDA and that none of the state lands on the

Ampara-Uhana main road would be requ ired by the UDA. The land in dispute is situated on the

Ampara-Uhana main road.

On 18.03.2005 a mobile service was held at the initiative of the Hon. Minister of Agriculture,

Lands, Irrigation and Livestock to resolve land disputes within the Ampara Divisional Secretariat

area. The Member of Parliament for the Digamadulla District informed the Petitioners to refer

their problem to the said mobile service (A13).

The Petitioners and their brother attended the said mobile service and it was attended by the

Deputy Minister of Lands, the Surveyor-General, 1st to 3,d Respondents and Grama Niladharis of

all the relevant divisions. They were informed by the relevant officials that since their lands

have not been taken over by the UDA, arrangements would be made to grant each of them

plots of land 20 perches in extent out of the said land and that they would be given long term

leases in respect of the said plots of land.

This decision is reflected in document A23 which states inter alia that 40 perches should be

given for a business purpose to P.L.S. Perera and 20 perches each should be given for

residential purposes to the Petitioners and their brother Hewa Gajanayake Anura. It is further

stated that the remaining land out of the 15 acres should be used for a housing project and that

grants should be made to the Petitioners in respect of the same lands they were occupying

under the permits.

Page 21 of 30

Thereafter, the 1st Respond ent took further steps in pursuance of the said decision (A14 and

A14A). The Petitioners paid for the said survey (A15). Cadastral Map (A16) and the Schedule of

Parcels (A17) was prepared and lots 679 and 680 were to be given to the Petitioners.

It later transpired that a Cabinet Memorandum dated 07.09.2005 had been submitted by the

21st Respondent, Ferial Ashroff, Minister of Housing and Common Amenities recommending the

lease and sale of land depicted in plan no. Am/AMP/2004/671 to the 7th Respondent, HDFC

Real Estate Development Ltd., to implement a housing project in the Ampara town which the

Cabinet approved (A30 and A31). The land in dispute is caught up in this decision.

The Petitioners have sought the following relief:

(a) Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the Cabinet of Ministers contained in A31;

(b) Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st to 3,d and/or 5th and/or 6th

Respondents or anyone or more of them not to grant the Petitioners long term leases in

respect of the said lands;

(c) Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st to 3'd and/or 5th and/or 6thand/or 8th to

59thRespondents or anyone or more of themto act according to the decision contained

in A23 and to grant them long term lease and/or a grant in respect of the said lands;

(d) Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1" to 59th Respondents from evicting the Petitioners

from the said lands and/or restricting their access to the said lands.

The foundation of the case of the Petitioners is that the decision A23 and the consequential

steps taken as reflected in A14, A14A, A15, A16 and A17 created a Ipgitimate expectation in

them that they will be given long term leases/grants for the land in dispute.

The Respondents do not dispute the decision A23. They however state that the said decision

was given by the Deputy Minister of Lands despite the fact of him being informed that steps

had already been taken to hand over the land in issue to the National Housing Development

Authority for a housing project for which the Respondents were awaiting Cabinet approval.

This position is not supported by the facts in this case as the mobile service was held on

18.03.2005 whereas the Cabinet Memorandum (A30) is dated 07.09.2005. Therefore by the

time the Cabinet took a decision on the Cabinet Memorandum (A30) on 29.09.2005 (A31) the

decision in A23 had been made. Yet nowhere in the Cabinet Memorandum (A30) is any

mention made of the mobile service held on 18.03.2005 or the decision (A23) pertaining to the

Petitioners made at the said service.

The arbitrariness of the Cabinet Memorandum (A30) and the decision thereon (A31) becomes

visible upon a consideration of the subsequent developments. By letter dated 26.04.2007, the

27th Respondent informed the 59th Respondent that the aforesaid housing project is to be

implemented in the Karangawa area which is situated within the limits of the Buddhangala

National Park and that the Cabinet approval had been obtained without disclosing necessary

and correct information. Furthermore, by letter dated 05.09.2007 (CAS) the Director General of

Wildlife Conservation informed the 27th Respondent that a portion of state land situated within

the Ampara National Park was to be used for the aforesaid housing project for which the

approval of the Department of Wildlife Conservation has been sought. It is further stated that

approval was refused by the Department of Wildlife Conservation for environmental

conservation reasons.

In Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service [(1985) A.C. 374, 408-9J Lord

Diplock stated that for a legitimate expectation to arise, the decision:

"must affect ~th eJ other person .... by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which

either (i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision maker to enjoy and which

he can legitimately expect to be permitted continue to do until there has been

communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been

given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-

maker will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing

reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn." (emphasis added)

Page 23 of 30

The terms of the representation by the decision-maker must entitle the party to whom it is

addressed to expect, legitimately, one of two things:

(a) That a hearing or other appropriate procedure will be afforded before the

decision is made. (Procedural Legitimate Expectation); or

(b) That a benefit of a substantive nature will be granted or, if the personis already

in receipt of the benefit, that it will be continued and not be substantially varied.

(Substantive Legitimate Expectation)

In Sri Lanka the concept of procedural legitimate expectation has been recognized consistently.

[Sundarkaran v. Bharathi and Others [1989) 1 Sri. l. R. 46, Desmond Perera v. Karunaratne,

Commissioner of National Housing [1994J 3 Sri. l. R. 316(CA); [1997J 1 Sri. L. R. 148(SC), Laub v.

Attorney-General [199SJ 2 Sri. l. R. 88, Multinational Praperty Development Limited v. Urban

Development Authority [1996J 2 Sri. l. R. SlJ.

The courts have accepted that procedural protection should be given where an individual has a

legitimate expectation of procedural protection such as a hearing or a consultation before a

decision is made. It is also accepted that where an individual has a legitimate expectation that a

benefit of a substantive nature will be granted, or if already in receipt of the benefit, that it will

be continued, then fairness too dictates that expectation of the benefit should give the

individual the entitlement to be permitted to argue for its fulfilment. The controversy is

whether in such situations the individual has a legitimate expectation that the benefit will be

granted or continued. This is the question of substantive legitimate expectation.

The traditional objection to the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is two-fold:

(a) Ultra Vires by fettering the discretion

(b) The principle of legality

Page 24 of 30

The arguments in favour of permitting substantive legitimate expectation are based on the

principle of legal certainty. It is said that where a public body makes a promise it is in the

interests of good administration that it should act fairly and should implement its promise.

Prior to the Court of Appeal decision in R. v. Secretary af State for the Home Deportment, ex p

Hargreaves [(1997) 1 W. l.R. 906] the weight of authority was in favour of the developing

doctrine of substantive legitimate expectations. There was direct support in R. v. Secretary of

State for the Home Department, ex p. Ruddock [1987] 1 W.l.R. 1482 and R. v. Ministry for

Agriculture, Fisheries and Floods, ex p ~/amble (Offshore) [1995] 2 AI E.R. 714 while indirect

support could be found in R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p Khan [1984]1

W.l.R. 1337.

However, in R. v. Secretary of Stale for the Home Department, ex p Hargreaves [(1997) 1 W.L.R.

906] the court cast a shadow over the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation by

suggesting that it was not for the court to determine the fairness of a Minister's decision not to

accommodate a reasonable expectation which a policy would thwart, as this amounted to an

intrusion into the merits of the decision. It was suggested that on matters of substance

Wednesbury is the correct test, and that the doctrine of legitimate expectation, based on

fairness, cannot be extended from procedural to substantive matters. It was for the decision-

maker to undertake the balancing act: to decide whether the expectation should be protected

or whether the public interest is strong enough to override the expectation . The court would

only quash the decision to apply the new policy instead of the old, if it could be shown that the

decision maker's judgement to do was irrational, Wednesbury unreasonable; it could not be

quashed on the basis of fa irn ess. The court in R. v. Secretory of State for the Home Department,

ex p Hargreaves (supra) overrode R. v. Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Floods, ex p

Hamble (Offshore) (supra) in so far as court ~ aid that a balancing e,ercise should be undertaken

by the cOllrt.

Page 25 of 30

In R. v. North and East Devon /-Iea/th Authority, ex p. Cough/an [(2000) 2 W.L.R. 622J the

question was considered in detail by the Court of Appeal and it was stated that the starting

point is to ask what the individual's legitimate expectation was, and suggested that where there

is a dispute as to this it is to be determined by the court, with there being at least three possible

outcomes with the court taking a different role in respect of each category.

(a) The Court may decide the public body only needs to bear in mind its previous policy or

assurances, giving it the weight, it thought fit, but no more, before deciding to change

course. The Court wi ll then only review the decision on conventional Wednesbury

grounds.

(b) The Court may decide that the representation gives rise to a legitimate expectation of

procedural benefit and if so, the Court will require the opportunity for consultation to

be given unless there is an overriding reason to withdraw from it.

(e) The Court will in a proper case, decide whether to frustrate the expectation is so unfair

that to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power. Once the

legitimacy of the expectation is established, it is for the Court to determine whether

there is sufficient overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy or to justify

departing from the promise. The Court is undertaking a balancing exercise between the

public interest and the individual's interest. This category is a clear acceptance of the

doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation. The Court defined the type of case of an

enforceable expectation of a substantive benefit as being ""here the expectation is

confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the

character of a contract. Promises rather than policies are more likely to fall within this

category.

In Sri Lanka substantive legitimate expectation has been recognized in a few instances.

[Dayaratne and others v. Minis/er of /-Iea/th and Indigenous Medicine ancl Others [1999) 1 Sri. l.

R. 393, Mowjood v. Pussadeniya [1987) 2 Sri. L. R. 287J.

Page 26 of 30

However, Weerasuriya J. in Sirimal and others v. Board of Directors of the Co-operative

Wholesale Establishment and others [(2003) 3 Sri.L.R. 23 at 29J set out the position as follows:

"Therefore, when there is a substantive legitimate expectation in need of protection, it

is for the decision maker and not the Court to judge whether that expectation should be

protected or whether broader public interest is so strong as to override the expectation.

The Court would only intervene if the decision maker's judgment was perverse or

irrational. Thus, the present position is that the substantive protection of legitimate

expectation has to be sought on the more traditional approaches of the English Law

namely (a) procedural protection and (b) protection in terms of 'Wednesbury'

un reasonab I eness."

This decision appears to shut out the third category discussed in R. v. North and East Devon

Health Authority, ex p. Coughlan(supra). This court is bound by the Judgment of the Supreme

Court unless it is one made per incuriam [RamanathanChettiar v. Wickremarachchi and others

(1979) 2 Sri.L.R. 395J.

However, in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution, this Court will issue writs "according to

law" which has consistently been interpreted to mean English Common Law [Wijesekera v.

Assistant Government Agent, Matara (44 NLR 533 at 538), Nakuda Ali v. Jayaratne (51 NLR 457

at 461), Colambo Commercial Co. Ltd. v. Shanmugalingam (66 NLR 26 at 32), Mendis, Fowzie

v.Goonewardena, Silva ((1978-79) 2 Sri.L.R. 322 at 356, 363), Mohideen v. Goonawardene

(1986) 2 C.A.L.R. 487 at 493, Sirisena Cooray v. Tisso Dias Bandaranaike (1999) 1 Sri. L. R. 1 at

14-15].

To that extent the dicta of Weerasuriya J. in in Sirimal and others v. Board of Directors of the

Co-operotive Wholesale Establishment and others(supra) i" per incuriam as R. v. North and East

Devon Health Authority, ex p. COllghlan(supra) was not considered. Accordingly, in my view the

third category identified in in R v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex p.

Coughlan(supra) which allows for substantive legitimate expectation to be protected and

enforced by court is, subject to the criteria identified therein, part of OUI law.

Page 27 of 30

In fact I came to the same conclusion in Galle Festival Guarantee Ltd. vs. Galle Municipal Council

[CA. (PHC) No. 155/2010; CAM. 01.03.2019] which was cited with approval (at page 46) by

Prasanna Jayawardena P.C J. in Ariyaratne ond Others v. N.K. Ilangakoon, Inspector-General of

Police ond Others [S.C (FR) No. 444/2012; S.CM. 30.07.2019] wherein his Lordship went on to

examine more closely the application of the substantive legitimate expectation in Sri Lanka and

held (at page 53):

"To sum up, I am of the view that, in cases where a court is deciding a claim that a

petitioner's substantive expectation has been negated by a public authority's change of

policy or change of decision which is said to have been adopted in th e public interest,

the court should adopt a two-step approach. First, to examine whether the constituent

elements of the claimed substantive legitimate expectation are in line with the

principles referred to earlier which describe the usual characteristics of a substantive

legitimate expectation that a court may be inclined to protect and enforce. If those

constituent elements or such of them as are deemed appropriate in the facts and

circumstances of the case are present, the second step would be to apply a 'test' on the

broad lines of that set out in DAYARATHNA. To be more specific, when doing so: the

court should weigh the character and substance of the expectation and the prejudice

caused to the petitioner by its frustration, on the one hand, against the importance of

the public interest which led to the public authority's change of heart, on the other

hand; and then decide whether that exercise of weighing the competing interests leads

to t~e conclusion that the petitioner's expectation is of SUC!l weight and consequences

of its frustration are so prejudicial to him when compared to the public interest relied

on by the public authority, that the public authority's decision to change its policy and

negate the expectation was disproportionate or unfair or unjust and amounted to an

abuse of power which should be quashed; or whether the decision to change the policy

should stand because the public authority has ,Icted proportionately, fairly and justly

when it decided that the petitioner's substantive legitimate expectation tould not be

granted sillce public interest demanded a change of policy".

The learned Senior Counsel contended that the Petitioners could not have had a legitimate

expectation once they were informed by A9 that the land in issue was to be allotted to the UDA

and the fact that the annual permit was not extended after 2002, However, the legitimate

expectation claimed by the Petitioners are in fact rooted in the decision A23 taken with the

participation of the Deputy Minister of Lands at a mobile service held to resolve land issues

within the Divisional Secretariat Division of Ampara, It is not a representation made to the

people at large but only to the Petitioners, Furthermore, it specifically states that the extent of

the whole land is 15 acres and that after giving 40 perches for a business purpose to P, L.S,

Perera and 20 perches each for residential purposes to the Petitioners, their brother Hewa

Gajanayake Anura, the remaining land out of the 15 acres should be used for a housing project

and that grants should be made to the Petitioners in respect of the same lands they were

occupying under the permits,

In my view the representation made to the Petitioners come within the meaning of legitimate

expectation that the law will prot~ct. The whole purpose of the Minister of Lands init iating

mobile services to solve land disputes with the participation of the Deputy Minister of Lands

will be rendered redundant if people cannot rely on representations and decisions taken at

such mobile services, I hold that the decision taken A23 created a legitimate expectation in the

Petitioners that they will be given grants, No argument was made that such representation was

ultra vires for any reason, The Cabinet decision was taken much later in September 2005,

Since the legitimate expectation so created in the Petitioners were negated without giving

them a hearing, the Cabinet decision contained in A31, in so far as it affects the rights of the

Petitioners are concerned, is quashed by a writ of certiorari,

That leaves the question of th e writ of mandamus to be considered, The legitimate expectation

sought to be enforced by a writ of mandamus in my view falls within public duty, The

representation sought to be enforced was made only to the Petitioners and their brother (who

is not a party to this application), Given that th e decision A23 recognizes that the balance

portion of 15 ;]cres l1lily be used for the housing project, this is a fit and proper case to

recognize and protect the substantive legitimate expectation entertained by the Petitioners by

Pap,c 29 of 30

granting a writ of mandamus compelling the 1st to 3'" and/or 5th and/or 8th to 257t"

Respondents or anyone or more of themto act according to the decision contained in A23 and

to grant them long term lease and/or a grant in respect of the said lands.

For the avoidance of doubt, this decision in no way recognizes the validity of the Cabinet

decision marked A31 given that certain approvals required for the implementation of the

housing project has not been given for the reasons set out above. This Court has limited the

relief to the rights of the Petitioners since they were seeking to protect their individual rights

and not the larger public interest.

Writs of certiorari and mandamus issued.

The parties shall bear their costs.
