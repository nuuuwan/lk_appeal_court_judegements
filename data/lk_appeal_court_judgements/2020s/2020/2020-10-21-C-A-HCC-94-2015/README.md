ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Appellant was indicted before the High Court of Ampara for

committing murders of Basnayaka Mudiyanselage Mahindasiri and Amarasinhe

Arachchilage Rasika Sampath, by shooting on 25.09.2008, in addition to committing

attempted murder of Konara Midiyanselage Surawimala, in the same course of

transaction.

After trial, the Appellant was convicted to both murder counts and also to

the attempted murder count. He was sentenced to death on account of two

murder counts while an 8-year term of imprisonment was imposed on account of

attempted murder with a fine of Rs. 5000.00, and in default of which, a further 6

months of imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the Appellant had

preferred the instant appeal in seeking to have them set aside.

At the hearing of the Appellant's appeal, learned Counsel primarily

challenged the conviction for murder on the ground that the trial Court had

failed to consider of the lesser culpability of the Appellant on the basis of grave

and sudden provocation, sudden fight and exceeding private defence.

The prosecution evidence revealed that the Appellant, who was serving as

a Home Guard attached to Maha-Oya Police Station, had been assigned to the

guard room of the pumping station of National Water Supply and Drainage

Board, off Nil Oba-Pallebadde Road, located in close proximity to Maha-Oya

stream. This pumping station supplied water to almost all Government buildings

in Maha-Oya town, including the Government Hospital and Maha-Oya Police.

There was a gravel road leading up to the stream, through which water bowsers

2

and other vehicles could arrive at the pumping station for their water

requirements. The pump house was built on a land in an extent of about one

Acre and had a barbed wire fence around its perimeters. The premises had and

entrance fitted with iron gates and the guard room was located within the said

premises.

On the day of the incident, the Appellant had assumed duties at this guard

room at 6.30 a.m., along with another Home Guard, Tennakoon Mudiyanselage

Priyantha Samarajeewa (PW6). The guard room was under the supervision of a

Police Sergeant Dissanayake.

The deceased Basnayaka Mudiyanselage Mahindasiri was an army soldier,

serving in the operational areas and had returned home on leave. He, along with

the other deceased, who is a sailor and also was on leave and the injured, had

arrived at Maha-Oya town in his own three wheeler and, having purchased a

bottle of alcohol, was searching for a place to bathe. Having heard about a tube

well, a popular bathing spot of the area, the three had proceeded only to find that

the tube well was dysfunctional. Then they thought of Mah- Oya stream near the

pump house as a convenient bathing spot, and have travelled along the road up

to the pump house, where the Appellant was stationed.

The three of them have arrived near the pump house at about 3.00 p.m.

and have stopped the three wheeler near the entrance to the pump house. The

injured Surawimala in his evidence said that they had stopped the vehicle near

the pump house and was planning to proceed up to the stream on foot. At that

point of time a Home Guard, who was later identified as the Appellant, had

3

stopped them to inform that they could not be allowed to go beyond that point.

The two deceased and the Appellant had an exchange of words over that

direction and the Appellant had said " G<ii(9Q @3ll<; cqC>Q) tl)6~roS". One of the

deceased Rasika Sampath then started to reverse the three wheeler as he could not

turn it to go back. The injured was seated in the back and as the vehicle turned,

he heard sounds of gun fire. He heard about 6-7 shots being fired. With the

hearing of gun fire, Rasika Sampath and the injured had got down from the

vehicle. The injured received a gunshot and lost consciousness.

Several days later, he learnt that while receiving treatment at the

Government hospital the other two had died due to the shooting,.

The other eye witness to the incident, Samarajeewa, had narrated a different

version of sequence of events that had culminated with the act of shooting.

Samarajeewa said in his evidence that the Appellant, having stopped the

vehicle, had very politely enquired from the passengers where they intend to

proceed. The response to that polite query by the Appellant was in the form of

harsh reply in obscene and offensive language making derogatory references to

the Appellant's mother. The Appellant tried to explain that he was simply doing

his duty to the three, who by this time had alighted from the three wheeler. They

were unarmed.

The stopping had resulted in an argument between the Appellant and the

three passengers which then turn to a fight. Samarajeewa too had received few

blows which made him to take evasive action and then to withdraw from the

scene. At that point of time, the witness saw the Appellant firing his T 56 weapon

at the three intruders. All three fell down after the firing. Samarajeewa was told by

4

the Appellant, only at a subsequent point of time, that he too was assaulted

during the scuffle by two of the three, who arrived by the three wheeler.

Having witnessed that three of them have sustained injuries due to the

Appellant's firing, the witness had run up to Police check point to inform of the

incident. He conveyed that the Appellant fired shots after the group had

assaulted them.

Witnesses Bandara, Attanayaka and Jayatilaka were attached to Maha -Oya

Police and were resting in the barracks. They have heard sounds of gun fire from

the direction of the pump house. Due to the situation that prevailed in the area

due to terrorism and the frequent attacks on Government forces, the three of

them have ran towards the pump house taking their weapons with them

thinking it was under attack.

Jayatilaka was the first to arrive at the scene and upon seeing him the

Appellant said they attacked us (q80 ~o (3)l~Cl)) and handed over his gun. It

smelt burnt gun powder. They saw three persons with bleeding injuries lying on

the ground and have taken them to the hospital using the three wheeler that was

parked near them. They also saw the Appellant who appeared to be disturbed

and under stress.

IP Upali Silva investigated this incident. He noted an empty bottle of

alcohol and a half empty coca cola bottle with few packets of savouries. There

was also a bucket, soap and clothing. The Appellant was produced to him by

Jayathilake. The Appellant appeared to be quite shaken. Three buttons of his

uniform was missing and he had several nail marks on his chest and several

scratch marks on abdomen. The witness also smelt alcohol from the Appellant.

5

At the scene, the witness noted three blood patches and recovered 4 spent

ammunition casings. He also noted that the three wheeler had damages due to

gun fire.

The witness described the importance of the pump station to the area as

the STF and the Army were dependent on this facility for their water

requirements, in addition to supplying water to Maha-Oya town and its civilian

population. Due to the security concerns the general public was prevented

having access to the road leading up to the pump house.

Since the two deceased were serving members of Army and Navy, there

had been instances of reprisals by the members of these two forces on check

points manned by Home Guards over this incident and the Police was deployed

to diffuse the tense situation during the funeral of the two deceased.

The medical evidence confirmed that the two deceased have died due to

firearm injuries and the injured too had similar injuries.

The Appellant too had given evidence under oath. He testified to the effect

that he has served as a Home Guard for 17 years and had studied up to grade 8.

At the time of the incident, he was assigned to the pump house for his 12-hour

duty shift.

A water bowser from STF had pumped water and the officers have

informed the Appellant they would return soon for the second loading. He saw a

three wheeler being parked near the gate at about 3.30 p.m. He walked up to the

three wheeler and politely told the passengers that the water bowser is due to

arrive and for them to park the vehicle further down the road without

obstructing the bowser. This request had irked the passengers, who then got off

and uttered obscenities. One of them pulled the Appellant by his shirt while the

6

other person attempted to grab his weapon. He was assaulted by the two. As the

three of them were grappling for the weapon and the gun accidently went off.

During cross-examination too the Appellant maintained his position that he did

not shoot at them deliberately.

During the trial, although Samarajeewa gave contradictory version to that

of the injured, the prosecution had opted not to treat him as an adverse witness

to its case. In the impugned judgment, however, the trial Court had opted to

disbelieve the prosecution witness Samarajeewa's evidence and also the

Appellant. The basis on which Samarajeewa was disbelieved by the trial Court

appears to be that it had formed the view that he is a partial witness towards the

Appellant and gave an improbable and inconsistent version of events as to the

incident. The improbability of Samarajeewa's version of events, as per the

judgment, was his claim of three unarmed persons have attacked two armed

persons. It appears that the trial Court applied the test of probability in

consideration of only one of many probabilities favourable to the prosecution

while failing to consider the probabilities that are in favour of the Appellant. If

Samarajeewa's claim of three unarmed persons attacking two armed men is

improbable, as justifiably found by the trial Court, similarly the prosecution

version too carries a similar improbability of its version, when it claimed that the

Appellant, who had 16 years of unblemished service as a Home Guard, had

indiscriminately shot three total strangers, against whom he absolutely had no

motive, merely because they had an exchange of words, totally disregarding the

consequence of his acts. It is unfortunate that the trial Court failed to consider

this probability also with the probability it did consider and stated its reasons

adopting the reason of the prosecution.

7

As to the inconsistencies of the witness's evidence, the trial Court noted

Samarajeewa, having said that he did not see the Appellant being hit by the three

intruders had subsequently changed position by stating that he did. The

evidence of the said witness does not indicate any inconsistency as to whether he

saw the Appellant being assaulted by the intruders. In his examination in chief as

weIl as cross-examination the witness was consistent that the AppeIlant was

assaulted by two, while he was assaulted by the other. The witness even had

distinguished that the person who assaulted him did not assault the AppeIlant,

although he too was shot at during the firing.

Another reason on which the trial Court rejected Samarajeewa's evidence is

its perceived partiality towards the AppeIlant. It is the prosecution who caIled

the witness during its case and was cross examined by the AppeIlant. If he was

partial towards the AppeIlant, the witness could have said that no civilian was

all owed near the pump house, a fact confirmed by IP Silva. But contrary to the

AppeIlant's claim, the witness said that anyone could use the road leading to the

pump house during his cross-examination. The witness claimed the three had

assaulted two of them. If he was partial towards the AppeIlant, he could have

merely said that only the AppeIlant was assaulted and not him, since that would

have helped the AppeIlant to set up a claim of self-defence. The trial Court also

ruled that he is a partial witness because they lived in the same village for some

time and the witness could not recoIlect when they met after the AppeIlant was

released on bail. None of these consideration support a proposition that the

witness is in fact a partial witness and any absence of any contradiction indicated

that he gave a consistent version of events since the incident. The only blemish

attributable to him is he gave evidence inconsistent with the evidence of the

injured.

8

The trial Court had failed to consider IP Upali Silva's evidence that the

Appellant's shirt had torn buttons and his upper body had nail and scratch

marks, an observation that supports the claim of Samaraweera in the absence of

any explanation by the prosecution to the contrary that the Appellant was

attacked by the two deceased.

This Court, being mindful of the principle that a determination of

credibility of a witness is a question of fact and therefore is best left to the trial

Court, nonetheless, is of the view that it should interfere in this instance with a

finding of fact by the trial Court, since Samaraweera's evidence could not have

been rejected on an erroneous considerations in the guise of improbability of

version and being inconsistent. It was held in Dharmasiri v Republic in Sri

Lanka(2010) 2 Sri L.R. 241, that an appellate Court could interfere with such

findings if they are manifestly wrong and the said finding of fact qualifies to be

treated as such.

The trial Court, having considered the evidence on the point and formed

the view that there could have been an incident by which the Appellant was

grabbed by his uniform and assaulted, nonetheless concludes that these factors

would not alter the prosecution case as the Appellant was simply acting on his

anger and not in the interest of security of the pumping station or his right to

self-defence.

In a single sentence the trial Court further holds that the evidence does not

satisfy the requirement to apply the exception of grave and sudden provocation,

but did not elaborate on its process of reasoning leading up to that conclusion by

giving reasons.

9

It is on that basis the Learned Counsel for the Appellant contends that the

evidence clearly points to a case of grave and sudden provocation, which factor

should have been considered in the Appellant's favour by the trial Court.

It appears that the trial Court had formed the impression that the pumping

station was not considered as a facility that requires high level of security as the

Appellant claims since IP Upali Silva in his evidence admitted that general public

could leave their vehicles near the pumping station and to have access to Maha-

Oyastream.

Contrary to this view formed by the trial Court, IP Upa/i Silva had testified

that he had assigned two Home Guards under a Police Sergeant for the security

of the facility and it was guarded 24 hours since the area was constantly under

the threat of terrorist attack. During his cross-examination, when the witness was

questioned whether the civilians use the road leading to the pump house, he

answered in the negative and added;

" .!llz Oll'!!)ll 1!i.1Dc39 ~@lCD~O o~.!!) @I~~@I.!!) .!llz. tSll tSlQ

@lOli;)OlG)lO@lO C)l~ cnO.!!) .1D6e:)J(S~ cntlO~lO OCDOB ~CD'!!) @~@I.!!). "

When considered in the light of the evidence quoted above, the view

formed by the trial Court as to the level of security provided to the pump house

is indicative of the fact that the pump house was not considered as a security

sensitive facility is clearly erroneous as well as the conclusion reached by the

Court that there were no restrictions that had been placed to civilians in having

10

access to the general pump house area. This particular view would not have

adversely affected the position of the Appellant, if not for another view formed

by the Court, based on this conclusion. That is the trial Court's observation that

the Appellant's act of stopping and questioning the three wheeler passengers

was totally an unnecessary act and was clearly in excess of his assigned duties. It

appears that the trial Court had therefore formed the opinion that the Appellant

confronted the three wheeler quite unnecessarily and had created the situation,

which ended up in a tragedy.

This particular act of the Appellant, being the turning point of the

sequence of events, which eventually led to the death of two servicemen and

caused serious injuries to the injured, clearly will have a bearing on the

determination of the question of whether there was provocation and if so,

whether that provocation is self-induced provocation.

In the absence of any reasons by the trial Court, this Court could only

guess the reasons for the rejection of the exception of grave and sudden

provocation.

But the evidence seemed to suggest a different conclusion is also possible

and could even be justified, if the trial Court had considered the evidence in its

proper context and indicated its mind by giving reasons.

It is undisputed that the area in which the Appellant was assigned to is

vulnerable to terrorist attacks and he was placed on a 12 hour shift with his

colleague. It is natural for him to feel anxious and tensed due the prevailing

security situation at that point of time. The Appellant is quite justified in making

enquiries when the three wheeler came to a halt near the pumping facility with

three passengers. Samarajeewa said the Appellant asked politely from the

11

passengers, who were apparently after liquor, as to where they were going.

Their response was an obscene reference to the mother of the Appellant. This led

to a verbal altercation between the two sides, which soon turn out to be a

physical confrontation. The Appellant too was after liquor and was attacked by

three persons, while his colleague had abandoned him by running away after

receiving a blow, leaving him to defend himself.

In this context the place where the firing took place is important. One

large blood patch that was noted by IP Silva near the gate post. Dr Ratnapriya

confirmed that deceased Rasika Sampath had an entry wound with blackening

round it, indication a close range fire. These factors indicative of the position that

when the firing commenced the three persons were near the gate although the

second blood patch was located over 50 feet from the gate. The Appellant who

was facing an unmatched contest had been provoked to lose his self-control, had

shot the three individuals.

PS 36878 Jayatilaka was the first person who spoke to the Appellant after

the incident of shooting. The Appellant responded when his name was called

out. The Appellant appeared shocked and fearful and, in order to comfort and

instill confidence in him, the witness held his hand and guided him to the Police.

There was no indication, that the Appellant had approved what he did, to the

witness either by words or by his conduct.

On the contrary, the conduct of the Appellant, which had been observed

by the witness, after a lapse of only few minutes since the shooting, was that he

had regained senses and realised the gravity of his actions.

In view of these considerations, this Court will now consider whether

these factors fall short of the criterion that had been laid down by judicial

12

precedents in relation to grave and sudden provocation, as concluded by the trial

Court.

In the case of Muthu Banda v The Queen 56 NLR 217, the trial Court

summed up the jury on following terms;

" ... by provocation is meant anything which a reasonable man is

entitled to resent. Provocation, as I said, must be sudden, and

provocation must be grave. Grave provocation would be

provocation that can cause a reasonable man, a man of ordinary

sense and prudence and temper of the same class of life or station in

life as the accused, to lose his power of self-control. It is quite

possible that an act which may not cause a sober man to lose his

self-control may cause a drunken man to lose his self-control.

Once you are satisfied that provocation was grave and that it

would be grave provocation to a reasonable man, then in

considering whether this particular accused lost his self-control as a

result of that provocation you should take into account the

circumstance that he was drunk, if you are satisfied that he was

drunk. But if you are considering whether the provocation was

grave, it is not open to you to say, ' it is true that this act of the

deceased man would not be grave provocation to a sober man but to

a drunken man it would be '. You will not take into account the

particular weakness of the accused when you are considering

whether the provocation offered was grave. That question you will

resolve by reference to an ordinary reasonable man, that is to a man

who is sober. "

13

The Court of Criminal Appeal, having considered the submissions

challenging its validity, has held; " ... it seems to us that there can be no doubt that

the law was correctly stated by the learned trial Judge in the case now before us."

In view of the principles of law enunciated in this judgment, the

provocation should be sufficient in the first place to destroy the self-control of a

reasonable man, who is an average man of the class of society to which the

Appellant belongs. Then secondly, whether the Appellant had lost his power of

self-control, an essentially a subjective test.

The absence of any motive against the three individuals, the Appellant's

conduct in firing indiscriminately at three persons following a fight, which had

erupted over his legitimate enquiry into the reason for their presence and the

harsh obscene response, which was couched in references to his mother, would

clearly provoke an average man of the Appellant's social standing. The word

provoke was defined in Perera v The King 53 NLR 202 as " .. . anything that ruffles

the temper of a man or incites passion or anger in him or cause disturbance of the

equanimity of his mind." In this sense too, the act of aggression displayed by the

three, amply qualified to be considered as sufficient provocation of an average

man of the Appellant's standing. Obviously the provocation is "sudden" and, if

taken in the proper context rightly be termed as "grave". Then in relation to the

secondary consideration of whether the Appellant had lost his power of self-

control, it must be noted that the act of indiscriminate shooting at three unknown

individuals in the absence of any compelling motive seemed clearly an irrational

and improbable act on the part of the Appellant, unless he had lost his senses.

14

There is no indication that the Appellant had any ideological inclinations or had

displayed happiness, in the killing of people and he derived happiness off an

achievement after the shooting.

However, in determining this issue, it is equally important to have regard

to the Privy Council decision of Attorney General v John Perera 54 NLR 265,

where it states that;

"The words " grave " and " sudden " are both of them relative

terms and must at least to a great extent be decided by comparing

the nature of the provocation with that of the retaliatory act. It is

impossible to determine whether the provocation was grave without

at the same time considering the act which resulted from the

provocation; otherwise some quite minor or trivial provocation

might be thought to excuse the use of a deadly weapon. A blow with

a fist or with the open hand is undoubtedly provocation and

provocation which may cause the sufferer to lose a degree of control

but will not excuse the use of a deadly weapon, and in the opinion of

Their Lordships it is quite wrong to say that because the Code does

not in so many words say that the retaliation must bear some

relation to the provocation it is true to say that the contrary is the

case."

In the instant appeal, as noted above the Appellant received very much

more than a "a blow with fist" as he was berated with obscenities in reference to

15

his mother for an act he had legitimately performed and then was attacked by

three individuals without a justification for such an act of aggression. The

subsequent conduct of the Appellant, as referred to earlier, in this judgment, is

an indication whether or not he had lost control of himself during that short

interval before the arrival of witness ]ayati/lake to whom the weapon was handed

over calmly, having shot three individuals a few minutes before.

This Court is thus satisfied that the Appellant is entitled to the benefit of

being imputed with lesser culpability and the trial Court should have found him

guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, instead of murder, in

relation to the death of the two deceased and attempted culpable homicide of the

injured instead of attempted murder.

Therefore, the conviction of murder is hereby set aside in relation to the 1st

and 2nd counts of the indictment along with the conviction for attempted murder

in relation to 3rd count and substituted them with culpable homicide not

amounting to murder in relation to 1st and 2nd counts while substituting of

attempted culpable homicide in relation to the 3rd count.

The Appellant is imposed an IS-year sentence of imprisonment on the 1st

and 2nd counts, in addition to a fine of Rs.1000.00 each, and in default of 2 years

of imprisonment. The sentence imposed by the High Court of Ampara on the 3rd

count remain unaltered. All sentences to run from the date of his conviction i.e.

16th March, 2015.

Appeal of the Appellant is partly allowed.
