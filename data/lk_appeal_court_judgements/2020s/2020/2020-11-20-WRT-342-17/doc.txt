Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner, Lanka Sathosa Limited, filed this application

seeking to set aside the arbitral award dated 22.01.2017 by a

writ of certiorari.

Sathosa Retail Limited became bankrupt and its liquidation

proceedings were concluded in 2013. The Petitioner was

established in 2005.

5

The position of the former employees of Sathosa Retail Limited is

that they were given the option of accepting a voluntary

retirement scheme and quitting their employment or continuing

their service in the new establishment, Lanka Sathosa Limited.

Some employees accepted a lump sum under the voluntary

retirement scheme and left, while others joined Lanka Sathosa

Limited to continue their service.

The position of the Petitioner is that Lanka Sathosa Limited is a

distinct legal entity, independent of Sathosa Retail Limited, and

there was no agreement that former employees of Sathosa Retail

Limited would be able to continue their service in Lanka Sathosa

Limited. The Petitioner is emphatic that the employees of

Sathosa Retail Limited who joined Lanka Sathosa Limited did so

as new employees.

The employees of Sathosa Retail Limited joined the Petitioner in

2005/2006. Sathosa Retail Limited was a State-owned entity;

so is the Petitioner, Lanka Sathosa Limited.

This disagreement over the promise of continuity of service can

be resolved by inter alia adverting to the messages of the subject

Minister and the Chairman of Lanka Sathosa Limited published

in the first Annual General Meeting Report of Lanka Sathosa

Limited, which form part of the evidence led before the

Arbitrator.

The Ministers message dated 23 June 2008 is revealing. The

Minister clears any lingering doubts in this regard when he says

The employees who had lost their employment after the cessation

of the Sathosa Retail Limited have been absorbed to the cadre of

Lanka Sathosa Limited, fulfilling one of the primary objectives of

6

setting up of the Lanka Sathosa Limited. The Chairman, in his

message dated 24 May 2008, says Lanka Sathosa Limited has

played a vital role in reducing the burden of inflation on common

people and has secured jobs of Sathosa Retail employees which

has relieved government of the financial and political stigma. If

the argument of Lanka Sathosa Limited is correct, the Minister

and the Chairman lied to the general public, including the

former employees of Sathosa Retail Limited. If the employees of

Sathosa Retail Limited joined Lanka Sathosa Limited as new

employees, there is no meaning to the Ministers message, which

is not mere impromptu remarks but a formal statement

presumably made after serious consideration. I cannot accept

the submission of learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the

Minister has loosely used the word absorbed in the message.

The former employees of Sathosa Retail Limited have not raised

this issue belatedly. They took up the matter with the proper

authorities from the very outset and kept on pursuing it. This is

borne out in the employees letter dated 27.05.2006 marked A11

to the Secretary to the Ministry of Trade soon after commencing

their employment at Lanka Sathosa Limited, their letter dated

11.07.2006 marked A13 addressed to the President of the

Republic, and their written complaint dated 14.07.2009 marked

A2 to the Minister of Labour and Commissioner of Labour. The

same is reiterated in the evidence of the 1st Respondent in the

arbitration proceedings.

The voluntary retirement scheme offered to employees of

Sathosa Retail Limited is marked A6 in the arbitration

proceedings. The fifth paragraph of the said document says that

as a result of the Minister having informed the Cabinet of the

7

plight of the employees, a decision was taken by the Government

to re-establish the entity and offer employees an ex-gratia

monthly payment of Rs.4,000 in the interim, indicating that

their employment would continue unbroken in the new

establishment.

The Report on Restructuring of Sathosa Retail Ltd by the

Postgraduate Institute of Management (University of Sri

Jayawardenapura) marked A21 is also helpful to solve the issue.

The said report appears to have been prepared pursuant to a

concept paper titled Restructuring programme to recommence

the business activities previously handled by the Cooperative

Wholesale Establishment and by Sathosa Retail Ltd. According

to this report and concept paper, the primary objective of the

restructuring is providing an efficient commodity retail trading

service to the consumer public andproviding continued

employment to an optimal number of employees of Sathosa Retail

Limited.

As the promise of continuity of service was not given effect to

notwithstanding several discussions between the management of

Lanka Sathosa Limited and the said employees, the Minister of

Labour, acting in terms of section 4 of the Industrial Disputes

Act, referred the following dispute for settlement by arbitration

in the year 2011:

Whether the non-amalgamation of the period of earlier

service at the Sathosa Retail Limited to the period of service

of Lanka Sathosa Limited of the four hundred and ninety

five (495) employees including Mr. P.H.C. Peiris whose

names are referred to in the attached schedule at the time

of joining them to the service of the new company, i.e.

8

Lanka Sathosa Limited on the liquidation of the former

company is justified and if not justified, to what relief each

of them is entitled.

After the inquiry, the Arbitrator made the impugned award

granting the relief sought by the employees.

The thrust of the argument of learned Counsel for the Petitioner

Lanka Sathosa Limited is that there was no evidence before the

Arbitrator to come to that conclusion. I am unable agree.

As learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent employee rightly

points out, it is illogical to say the 1st Respondent employee and

the other 494 employees refused the voluntary retirement

scheme, whereby they would have easily benefitted financially,

and opted instead to join Lanka Sathosa Limited as brand-new

employees. If they wanted to join Lanka Sathosa Limited as new

employees, it seems they could have done so after having

accepted the voluntary retirement package offered by Sathosa

Retail Limited. They did not accept the voluntary retirement

package because they wanted their period of service to continue

uninterrupted.

In addition to defending the arbitral award on the merits,

learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent employee takes up three

preliminary objections to the maintainability of this application.

Notwithstanding I am loath to uphold preliminary objections as

a means of disposing cases, in the facts and circumstances of

this case, I think, of the three, two are cogent enough to dismiss

the Petitioners application in limine without going into the

merits of the matter.

9

One objection is failure to add necessary parties as Respondents

to the application. The Petitioner admits that the dispute

referred for arbitration was in respect of 495 employees. The

arbitral award is in favour of all those 495 employees. However,

the Petitioner in the petition makes only one employee (i.e. the

1st Respondent P.H.C. Peiris) a party and, regarding the

remaining employees, simply says And 494 others. Those 494

employees have not been made parties to the case. No notices

were sent requiring them to be present in Court to defend the

arbitral award, if they so desire. Can this Court violate the audi

alteram partem rule with impunity and quash the decision of the

Arbitrator made in favour of those 494 employees without

affording them a hearing? Certainly not. Those 494 employees

are necessary parties to this application, without whom the case

cannot proceed. The Petitioner, having realised this grave

omission, endeavoured to amend the petition to add them as

parties at a later stage of the case. The application for

amendment was refused by this Court and, on appeal, by the

Supreme Court. The failure to add those 494 employees as

parties to the application is fatal. On that ground alone, the

application shall be dismissed.

Another preliminary objection is laches. The arbitral award had

been made on 22.01.2017 and the Petitioner filed this

application 11 months later on 19.10.2017. The Petitioner does

not explain this inordinate delay in the petition. This itself

disentitles the Petitioner to the discretionary and equitable relief

of certiorari.

10

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with costs.
