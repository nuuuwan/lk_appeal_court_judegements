K.K.WICKREMASINGHE, J.

The Aggrieved - Petitioner - Appellant has filed this appeal seeking to set aside the Judgment of

the Learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in

Kuliyapitiya dated 13.01.2016 in Case No. Rev 20/2013 and seeking to set aside the confiscation

order made by the Learned Magistrate of Hettipola dated 05.05.2011 in Case No. 4636 MISE.

Facts of the case:

The accused - driver A.H.S Darshana Senanayake was charged on 01.02.2010 before the

Learned Magistrate of Hettipola, for illegally transporting wood, an offence punishable under

section 25(2) read with sections 38A, 40, 40A and 2S(2)(b) of the Forest Ordinance as amended.

The accused-driver pleaded guilty to the said charge and the Learned Magistrate imposed a fine

ofRs.20,000.

Thereafter a vehicle inquiry was held with regard to the vehicle used for commission of the

offence. The Aggrieved-Petitioner-Appellant who is the registered owner of the vehicle

(hereinafter referred to as 'the appellant') gave evidence in the said inquiry. The Learned

Magistrate confiscated the vehicle by the order dated 05.05.2011.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the appellant preferred an application for revision to the

Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in Kurunegala. Subsequently, the said

matter was transferred to the Provincial High Court of North Western Province holden in

Kuliyapitiya. The Learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya dismissed the said revision

application by the order dated 13.01.2016.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the appellant preferred this appeal. The Learned Counsel

for the appellant submitted following grounds of appeal in written submissions;

I. The Judgement is contrary to the Law and against the weight of the evidence.

2. The Learned High Court Judge had erred in holding that the Learned Magistrate had

acted according to law when the Learned Magistrate failed to properly evaluate the

evidence laid down before him regarding the manner the vehicle was used and

precautionary measures taken by the registered owner.

Page 4 of 11

3. The Learned High Court Judge erred by disregarding the evidence of the Appellant

and holding that the registered owner haC! failed to take precautionary measures in

respect of the vehicle.

I wish to consider ground 2 and 3 together and ground 1 separately. The incident in question is

summarized as follows;

Ground 2 and 3

As per the evidence of the appellant, the vehicle was used for the following purposes;

"",~ @C~ q6m q~6t~~~ o& ,,(1)mUo. "' 1)tsJm~ "",al' 2fi1)",e:f mZ5l6 l:i)6 ~"'@mUo.

~"'@m Ut~ q~mUo, l:i)~CDe q~mUo." (page 116 of the brief)

The accused - driver and the appellant are son and father. On the date of the incident, the accused

- driver had taken the vehicle for the purpose of loading and transporting bricks. Consequently,

the owner has got to know that the vehicle has been taken in to the police custody while

transporting illegal wood. The accused-driver pleaded guilty to the charges and a fine was

imposed by the Learned Magistrate. Subsequent to holding of the vehicle inquiry, the Learned

Magistrate confiscated the vehicle by the order dated 05.05.2011.

At this stage I wish to set out the provisions of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance and

succeeding amendments thereto to show the gravity of the offence and punishment in the eyes of

the law.

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance reads as follows:

"When any person is convicted of a forest offence, all timber or forest produce which is

not the property of the Crown in respect of which such offence has been committed, and

all tools, boats, carts, cattle, and motor vehicles used in committing such offence, shall be

liable, by order of the convicting Magistrate"

Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance as amended by Act 56 of 1979 was repealed by Act No. 13 of

1982 and section 7 was substituted as follows:

Page 5 of 11

Section 40 (I);

Upon the conviction of any person for aforest offence -

(a) all timber of forest produce which is not the property of the State in respect of which

such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, boats, carts, cattle and motor vehicles used in committing such offence

(whether such tools, boats, carts, cattle and motor vehicles are owned by such person or

not), shall by reason of such conviction be forfeited to the State.

The proviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance (as amended by Act No.65 of 2009)

reads as follows;

"Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles, implements and

machines used in the commission of such offince, is a third party, no Order of

confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he

had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle

and machines, as the case may be,for the commission of the offence. "

Therefore it is trite law that in a vehicle inquiry conducted in terms of section 40{l) of the Forest

Ordinance, the burden of proving the precautionary measures taken to prevent an offence being

committed is cast on the vehicle owner. The statutory provision is further supported by a line of

legal authorities.

In the case of Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd. V. Range Forest Officer of Ampara

and another [SC Appeal No. 120/2011), it was held that,

"The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadu vs the Attorney

General. Therefore it is settled law that before an order for forfeiture is made the owner

should be given an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on balance of probability

satisfies the court that he had taken precautions to prevent the commission of the offence

or the offence was committed without his knowledge nor he was privy to the commission

of the offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner. "

Page 6 of 11

In the case of The Finance Company PLC. V. Agpmpodi Mahapedige Priyantha Chandana

and 5 others [SC AppeallOSAI2008 - decided on 02.07.2009), it was held that,

"On a consideration of the ratio decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions, it is

abundantly clear that in terms of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance, as amended, if the

owner of the vehicle in question was a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions

to prevent the use oIthe said vehicle for the commission of the offence. The ratio

decidendi of all the aforementioned decisions also show that the owner has to establish

the said matter on a balance of probability. "

In the case of x.w.P.G. Samarathunga V. Range Forest Officer, Anuradhapura and another

rCA (PHC) 89/2013), it was held that,

"The law referred to in the said proviso to Section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance

empowers a Magistrate to make an order releasing the vehicle used to commit the

offence, to its owner provided that the owner of the vehicle proves to the satisfaction of

the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent committing an offence under the

said Ordinance, making use of that vehicle ... "

Accordingly a vehicle owner should discharge the said burden of proof on a balance of

probability.

The counsel for the Appellant submitted that the Appellant had taken all the preventive steps to

stop commission of such offence. In page 116 and 117 of the brief, the testimony of the

Appellant elicited an insight to his stance.

Page 7 of 11

. .

When considering the evidence of the owner, "~l':l .~af co",~d 8go1~C> 2l)l!Ot" it is evident that

in fact he had no control over his son, the accused. Further he was trying to prove that he had no

knowledge.

However in the case of W. Jatathge Surasena V. o.l.e, Hikkaduwa and 3 others ICA (PHC)

APN 100/2014], it was held that,

" .. .A mere denial by the of Registered Owner of the fact that he did not have

knowledge. of the alleged commission is not sufficient as per the principle laid down in

the line of authorities regarding the confiscation, of a vehicle which had been used for a

commission of an offence for an unauthorized purpose ... "

In Mary Matilda Silva V. P.H. De Silva CA (PHC) 86/97, it was held that giving "mere

instructions" is not sufficient to discharge the said burden. The same stance is taken up in the

case of Saman Kumara and another v Attorney General CA (PHC) 157/12, where it is decided

that mere verbal instructions are not sufficient to discharge the burden. Similarly, in the case of

Kottasha Arachchige Ubhayaweera v. Range Forest Officer and Others CA (PHC) 9512012

decided on 04.09.2018 it was held as follows:

"Accordingly, it is amply clear that simply telling the driver is insufficient to discharge

the burden cast on the vehicle owner by law. "

In the case of K. w.P.G. Samarathunga v. Range Forest Officer and one other C.A (PHC)

No.89/2013, the term used in the judgment with regard to precautions, is "necessary

precautions". In the later part of this judgment, His Lordship Chitrasiri J pronounced the term a

"meaningful step". Therefore what amounts to a meaningful step is a question of fact to be

decided by the Court.

Therefore in light of the cited authorities, the law stands today makes it mandatory to prove

preventive measures taken by a vehicle owner in question, on a balance of probability.

Undoubtedly, such burden would not be discharged merely because the owner in question did

not have knowledge about an offence being committed or because the vehicle was not involved

in an offence previously.

Page 8 of 11

..

I observe that both, the Learned Magistrate and the, Learned High Court Judge, were of the same

opinion that the appellant had failed to discharge the said burden cast on him, to the satisfaction

of Court.

The Learned High Court Judge had made the following observation;

"15)V~ 3v25) !Jzsizll=o Elm CzsitslO2lSl~ wl'lC) 2lSlzll1fJ2lSlJO"'C)2lSl @ 9lzsiC)O tOO!JtslJ 2lSl0 <nzll

(Page 77 of the brief)

Therefore, I do not think that a vehicle owner, under the present law, can submit the absence of

knowledge as a ground to avoid a vehicle confiscation, anymore. Therefore, the above two

grounds of appeal too should fail and I am satisfied that both the Learned Magistrate and the

Learned High Court Judge had made well-reasoned orders, following due procedure.

Ground 1

Now I will consider whether the Learned Magistrate failed to consider the typographical error in

the evidence and whether the Learned High Court Judge considered such in his order.

The Learned Magistrate had made the following observation;

"wod gcd25) veC) 8~!1l~ G~2S"J' tsl@)'<!>cd' 62lSl 915)J Q)vzsi ~o OC)/))"'C025) 2lSl1 W~25) ~eJ8

<nzll Q)v 8~<!>co25) <n15)." (page 131 of the brief)

Afterwards, the Learned High Court Judge had made the following observation;

"ZI)i)~ @OdCl@l25l0 @i)~@i)2S'l' t1J 25lC ZI)~'P"'Zl! i)2S'l'@2S'l' i)t6~ @CCl "'t1J0 ~"'2l)'" "Zl!

@t!." (Page 78 of the brief)

Therefore, one cannot give much weight to the above mentioned typographical error. I observe

that the Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate had acted according to law,

properly evaluated the evidence laid down before him.

Considering above, I find no reasons to interfere with the order of the Learned High Court Judge

of Kuliyapitiya dated 13/0112016 and the order of the Learned Magistrate of Hettipola dated

05.052011. Therefore, I affirm the same.

The appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
