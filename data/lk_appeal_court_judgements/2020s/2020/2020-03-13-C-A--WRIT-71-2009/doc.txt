Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is seeking to be registered as a Medical Practitioner in terms of Section 41(2) (c)

of the Medical Ordinance No. 26 of 1927 as amended (Medical Ordinance). It reads as follows:

"(2c) Any estate dispenser whether he is employed on an estate or group of estates or

ceased to be so employed may, on furnishing proof to the satisfaction of the Director-

General of Health Services that -

(i) (a) he being an estate dispenser, has had an aggregate period of at

least twenty years of efficient and satisfactory service as an estate

dispenser; or

(b) he, being a dispenser, has had an aggregate period of at least

twenty years of efficient and satisfactory service as a dispenser on

an estate or group of estates and in the public service; and

(ii) he has within that period, served in one or more hospitals under one or more

medical practitioners for an aggregate period of at least two years; and

(iii) he has undergone a period of training prescribed for that purpose, be

registered by the registrar on payment of the prescribed fee, as being entitled to

practice medicine and surgery. The registrar shall maintain a register of the

persons registered under this subsection and erase therefrom the name of any

person ordered to be erased by the Medical Council under subsection (3) of this

section,"

The Petitioner claims that he has fulfilled all the requirements necessary in terms of this section

to be registered as a Medical Practitioner. The requirements to be fulfilled in so far as relevant to

the Petitioner are:

(a) Twenty years of satisfactory service as an estate medical dispenser;

(b) He has within that period, served in one or more hospitals under one or more medical

practitioners for an aggregate period of at least two years;

(c) He has undergone a period of training prescribed for that purpose.

The initial application made by the Petitioner for registration as a Medical Practitioner is R1

wherein his period of service as an estate dispenser is given as October 1972 to July 1989 which

is less than the required twenty (20) years. The Petitioner has signed the said application

confirming that the information furnished is factually correct. This period of service has been

Page 8 of 11

confirmed by the employer Ceylon Cold Stores Ltd. by letter dated 10.08.1992 (R2). On these

facts the Petitioner is not entitled to be registered as a Medical Practitioner in terms of Section

41(2) (c) ofthe Medical Ordinance. By letter dated 02.12.1993 (P12) the Petitioner was informed

that he was not eligible albeit on the incorrect assertion that he had worked as an estate

dispenser only from October 1972 to May 1973.

The Petitioner has not specifically referred to Rl other than stating at paragraph 14 of the petition

that he had in a previous application, mistakenly preferred to the Registrar of the Ceylon Medical

Council seeking to be registered as a Medical Practitioner, by inadvertence misstated the period

of employment at Ceylon Cold Stores. It certainly cannot be considered a mistake as the letter

dated 10.08.1992 (R2) issued by the employer confirms the period said to have been misstated

by the Petitioner. Nowhere in the petition does the Petitioner refer to the letter dated 10.08.1992

(R2).

In this context the Court must consider whether the Petitioner has been guilty of suppression

and/or misrepresentation of material facts as that is a ground to dismiss any writ application

without going into the merits of the application [W. S. Alphonso Appuhamy v. Hettiarachchi (77

N.L.R. 131 at 135,6), Hulangamuwa v. Siriwardena (1986) 1 SrLL.R. 275 , Callettes Ltd. v.

Commissioner of Labour (1989) 2 SrLL.R. 6, Laub v. Attorney General (1995) 2 SrLL.R. 88, Blanca

Diamonds (Pvtj Ltd. v. Wilfred Van Els (1997) 1 SrLL.R. 360, Jaysinghe v. The National Institute of

Fisheries (2002) 1 SrLL.R. 277, Dahanayake and Others v. Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd. and

Others [(2005) 1 SrLL.R. 57, Lt. Commander Ruwan Pathirana v. Commodore Dharmasiriwardene &

Others (2007) 1 SrLL.R. 24, Fonseka v. Lt. General Jogoth Joyasuriya and Five Others (2011) 2

SrLL.R. 372).

However, the learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that it is not a material fact and relied

on Fernondo and 18 Others v. Commissioner General of Labour ond Three Others [(2009) B.L.R.

74) where it was held that the requirements of full disclosure applies only to material facts.

However, the matters referred to above namely Rl and R2 are not immaterial or irrelevant facts.

They go to the very foundation of the application of the Petitioner to be registered as a Medical

Practitioner as they deal with the basic requirements to be registered.

The above finding is sufficient to dispose of the matter without going into the merits. However,

for sake of completeness I will examine the merits of the application as well.

.'

The Petitioner has produced letter dated 12th July 1994 (P5) issued by his former employer

wherein it refers to his period of employment as 9th May 1973 to 30th April 1993. If this letter is

factually correct Petitioner has fulfilled the requirements to be registered. However, this letter

has also been signed by the same person who issued letter dated 10.08.1992 (R2). He does not

state that R2 is withdrawn or is factually incorrect.

Here then the material facts are in dispute. In Thajudeen v. Tea Board and Another [(1981) 2

Sri.L.R. 471] it was held that where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result ofthe facts

is subject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should be canvassed in a suit where

parties would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses so that the Court would be

better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue.

The Petitioner is seeking writs of certiorari to quash decisions embodied in P12, P20, P22 and P27.

This application was instituted on 02.02.2009. The letter P12 is dated 02.12.1993. The letter P20

is dated 08.06.1999. The letter P22 is dated 20.11.2002. The letter P27 is dated 30.10.2008.

P27 is not a new decision but only a confirmation of an earlier decision contained in P20 dated

08.06.1999. The decision of the Sri Lanka Medical Council to reject the application of the

Petitioner was communicated by P12 and P20 and are dated 02.12.1993 and 08.06.1999

respectively. There has been a period of 16 and 10 years respectively prior to the Petitioner

seeking the intervention of this Court.

In Biso Menike v. Cyril De Alwis and Others [(1982) 1 Sri.L.R. 368 at 379] it was held that an

application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the

Order which the applicant seeks to have quashed. What is reasonable time and what will

constitute undue delay will depend upon the facts of each particular case. However, the time lag

that can be explained does not spell laches or delay. Ifthe delay can be reasonably explained, the

Court will not decline to interfere. The delay which a Court can excuse is one which is caused by

the applicant pursuing a legal remedy and not a remedy which is extra-legal. One satisfactory way

to explain the delay is for the petitioner to show that he has been seeking relief elsewhere in a

manner provided by the Law.

In this case the Petitioner has failed to satisfactorily explain the delay. What he has sought to do

is to try and resurrect the decisions made earlier by subsequent communications in order justify

his actions and assail the subsequent decisions reiterating the earlier decision. Such conduct will

not entitle the Petitioner to overcome the delay on his part [Gamaethige v. Siriwardena (1988) 1

Sri.L.R. 384].

For all the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed without costs.
