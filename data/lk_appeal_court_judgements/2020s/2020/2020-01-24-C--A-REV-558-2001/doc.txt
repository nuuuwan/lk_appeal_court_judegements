Counsel:

Rohan Sahabandu P.e. with Athula Perera for 2nd, 3,d and 4A Defendant-Petitioners

l. Amerasinghe with N. Malkumara for BA, BC, BD and BE Defendants-Respondents

Written Submissions tendered on:

2nd, 3,d and 4A Defendant-Petitioners on 20.05.2014

BA, BC, BD and BE Defendants-Respondents on 13.05.2014

Decided on: 24.01.2020

Janak De Silva J.

The 2nd - 4th Defendant-Petitioners by petition dated 04.05.2001 invoked the revisionary and/or

restitutionary jurisdiction of this Court and sought inter alia to set aside the judgment of the

learned District Judge of Kalutara dated 15.10.1990 (P5), the interlocutory decree and the final

decree in D.e. Kaluthara case No. 5457/P.

The Plaintiff instituted the action bearing No. 5457/P in District Court of Kalutara to partition the

land called "Parangiyawatte" containing in extent about Two (02) Roods morefully described in

the schedule to the plaint dated 30.04.19B7 (Pi) and claimed an undivided 107/360 share.

/ / The 2nd - 4th Defendants filed their Statement of Claim (P2) on 17.01.1990.

The 6th - 9th Defendants intervened and filed their Statement of Claim (P3) on 21.03.1990.

On 15.10.1990, the trial was held and the Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant and the 3,d - 8th Defendants

were present. All parties were represented by their Attorneys-at-Law (P4). The Plaintiff gave

evidence according to a settlement between the parties. Her evidence was not disputed and she

was not cross-examined by any of the Defendants. Judgment was delivered on the same day.

Consequently, an interlocutory decree was entered.

A commission was issued to prepare the Final Scheme of Partition. On 28.10.1991, the Plaintiff

sought to amend the plan No. 2493 dated 26.08.1991 made by G. Ambepitiya, Licensed Surveyor

(X3). On 24.06.1992, the amended plan No. 2493A dated 14.06.1992 made by G. Ambepitiya,

Licensed Surveyor (X5) was produced. An alternative Final Scheme of Partition depicted in plan

No. 560 dated 26.03.1993 made by B. K. P. W. Gunawardena, Licensed Surveyor was submitted

by the 2nd - 4th Defendants (X6).

On 16.07.1993, the Attorney-at-Law for the 2nd - 4th Defendants informed the Court that he was

unable to object to the Final Scheme of Partition during the inquiry due to an oversight. The 2nd

- 4th Defendants were afforded an opportunity to file written submissions on their objections to

the Final Scheme of Partition. By the Written Submissions dated 10.11.1993 (P6), the 2nd - 4th

Defendants submitted that the judgment dated 15.10.1990 is contrary to the provisions of

section 25 of the Partition Law and sought to set aside the said judgment and the Interlocutory

decree in terms of section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code.

The learned District Judge, by the Order dated 07.12.1993, rejected the application of the 2nd _

4th Defendants to set aside the judgment and the interlocutory decree. Also, the amended plan

No. 2493A dated 14.06.1992 made by G. Ambepitiya, Licensed Surveyor was approved since the

2nd - 4th Defendants did not prefer any objections to the same. A final decree was entered

accordingly.

Being aggrieved, the 2nd - 4th Defendants preferred an appeal to this Court by instituting the case

bearing No. 735/1993(F). On 20.07.2000, the judgment was delivered (Pl0) and the appeal was

dismissed with costs. Hence, the instant application.

Revision like an appeal is directed towards the correction of errors but it is supervisory in nature

and its object is the due administration of justice and not primarily or solely the relieving of

grievances of a party [Attorney General v. Gunawardena (1996) 2 Sri.L.R. 149J. Revisionary

powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has occurred due to a fundamental

rule of procedure being violated, but only when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive

miscarriage of justice [Vanik Incarparation Limited v. Jayasekara (1997) 2 Sri.L.R. 365]. The object

of revision is the due administration of justice and correction of errors [Kayas v. Nazeer and

Others (2004) 3 Sri.L.R. 202].

In Siripala v. Lanerolle and Anather [(2012) 1 Sri.L.R. lOS], Sarath De Abrew, J. observed that the

following tests have to be applied before the discretion of this Court is exercised in favour of a

party seeking the revisionary remedy-

(a) The aggrieved party should have no other remedy.

(b) If there was another remedy available to the aggrieved party, then revision would be

available if special circumstances could be shown to warrant it.

(c) The aggrieved party must come to the Court with clean hands and should not have

contributed to the current situation. (emphasis added)

(d) The aggrieved party should have complied with the law at that time.

(e) The acts complained of should have prejudiced his substantial rights. (emphasis added)

(f) The acts or circumstances complained of should have occasioned a failure of justice.

As I observed earlier, during the trial before the learned District Judge, the Plaintiff, the 1st

Defendant and the 3rd - 8th Defendants were present. Even though the 2nd Defendant was absent,

she and all the other parties were represented by their Attorneys-at-Law. When the evidence of

the Plaintiff was led, none of the Defendants objected to or disputed her evidence, both oral and

documentary. Neither was the Plaintiff cross-examined even though the opportunity was given.

Furthermore, it must be noted that the 2nd - 4th Defendants didn't object to the interlocutory

decree entered. It is only when the inquiry regarding the Final Scheme of Partition was held on

16.07.1993, almost three (03) years after the Judgment was delivered, the 2nd - 4th Defendants

sought permission of the Court to object to the Final Scheme of Partition. However, when the

opportunity was afforded, the 2nd - 4th Defendants requested to set aside the Judgment and the

Interlocutory decree in term s of Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code without objecting to the

Final Scheme of Partition.

Where a party by its own conduct has acquiesced in or approbated the defective proceedings,

the Court will not exercise its discretion to set aside the impugned proceedings. For it is not the

function of the Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction in restitution to relieve the parties of the

consequences of their own folly, negligence or laches [Don Lewis v. Dissanayake (70 N.L.R. 8)J.

In view of the above, I'm of the opinion that the Petitioners acquiesced in or approbated the

alleged defective proceedings.

The contention of the Petitioners is that the deeds marked by the Plaintiff-Respondent (i.e. '652'

and '751') to establish the title of the 6th - 9th Defendant-Respondents were not produced before

the learned District Judge for verification and the 6th - 9th Defendant-Respondents have obtained

a larger share to which they are not entitled. Also, the Petitioners claim that '652' and '751' are

not registered in the correct folio at the Land Registry. They seek to keep the undivided 190/360

share allotted to the 6th - 9th Respondents unallotted on the ground that the 6th - 9th Defendant-

Respondents have obtained an undivided 190/360 share by fraud and the Judgment should be

set aside for the reason that there has been an abuse of process of the Court.

In the case of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugam and Another [(1995) 1 Sri.L.R.

55)), Ranaraja, J. observed-

"Fraud is defined by Labeo as any craft, deceit or contrivance employed with a view to

circumvent, deceive or ensnare another person. (Lee - Introduction to Roman Dutch Law

5th Ed. p225). Learned President's Counsel endeavoured to convince this Court that the

Respondents had deceived the Original Court into giving an ex parte judgment on the

suppression of evidence and misrepresentations referred to. Clearly, the grounds relied on

by the Petitioner to prove fraud do nat fall within Labea's definition of fraud.

The principle on which this Court has to act is nat whether the Court that gave judgment

was tricked inta it, but whether one party to action was deceived by the conduct of the

opposing party. Clearly it was not the case in this instance. It was entirely due to the lack

of due diligence on the part of the Petitioner that it took no steps to file the Answer.

Thereafter, it failed to file the necessary papers within the stipulated period to have the

decree set aside. Had the Petitioner filed its answer at the proper time, it could have taken

up all the defenses which it claims would have deprived the Respondents of the Judgment

obtained in their favour. Thus, it cannot now camplain of a denial of justice. It has failed

to avail itself of the opportunity offered to present its case, not once but twice. When the

Court or the provisions of any law requires a party to adhere to specific mandatory time

limits, they should be complied with if due administration of justice is to be ensured. Those

who choose to ignore the time limits imposed, do so at their peril. They cannot be heard

to complain of injustice later. The remedy of restitutio in integrum is not available to a

party that has been guilty of a blatant lack of due diligence." [emphasis added]

As I observed earlier, during the trial, the 3,d and 4th Defendants were present and all of them

were represented by their Attorney-at-Law. But they did not object to or dispute the evidence

led by the Plaintiff nor was she cross-examined. The 2nd - 4th Defendants never objected to the

Interlocutory decree. Neither did they object to the Final Scheme of Partition when the

opportunity was given even when they sought permission of the Court after three (03) years.

Revision is a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the defendant is a matter which is intensely

relevant [Perera v. People's Bonk (1995) 2 Sri.L.R. 84).

In the aforesaid circumstances, I hold that the negligent conduct of the Petitioners disentitles

them to relief by way of revision and/or restitutio in integrum.

It must also be noted that the Petitioners were collectively allotted an undivided 63/360 which is

exactly what they claimed in their Statement of Claim dated 17.01.1990. Therefore, it is clear that

the Petitioners are not substantially prejudiced by the judgment of the learned District Judge of

Kalutara dated 15.10.1990, the interlocutory and the final decrees in case bearing No. 5457/P.

For all the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to invoke the jurisdiction

ofthis Court by way of revision and/or restitutio in integrum and I see no reason to interfere with

the judgment of learned District Judge of Kalutara dated 15.10.1990.

The application ofthe Petitioners is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 75,000/=.
