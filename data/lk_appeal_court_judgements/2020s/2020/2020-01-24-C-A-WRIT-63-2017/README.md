Respondents

Chaya Sri Nammuni SSC for 1't to 3rd Respondents

Written Submissions tendered on:

Petitioner on 29.08.2018

1st to 3rd Respondents on 21.11.2018

Decided on: 23.01.2020

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is seeking writs of certiorari quashing the orders dated 03.10.2016

(P9) and 29.10.2016 (P10) made by the 3rd Respondent. These two documents

contain decisions to the effect that there was a contract of employment between

the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent in relation to which the Petitioner has failed

to pay the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) contributions as required by the

Employee Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958 as amended (EPF Act) and action to

be taken to recover the said dues.

Partied agreed that this matter can be disposed by way of written submissions. The

Petitioner in the written submissions contends that the said decisions are ultra vires

and/or in breach of the principles of natural justice and/or without jurisdiction for

the following reasons:

(1) The 1st to 3,d Respondents completely ignored that the contract between the

Petitioner and the 4th Respondent does not fall within the definition of

Covered Employment in the EPF Act especially in view of the presumption in

statutory interpretation that statutes are territorial in application.

(2) The 1st to 3,d Respondents acted in excess of ju risdiction by failing to correctly

and properly consider whether the EPF Act provisions apply to the contract

of employment between the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent.

(3) The 1st to 3,d Respondents erred in applying the provisions of the EPF Act to

the contract of employment between the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent

when the governing law of the contract was Austrian Law.

(4) The principles of approbate and/or reprobate prevents the 4th Respondent

from recovering EPF dues as he represented to the Petitioner that he is not

entitled to EPF/ETF dues.

I will now consider each of these submissions although not in the same order.

Governing Law

The principal submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that it is well

settled law that when the parties elect a jurisdiction of a country the contract of

employment is governed by that country [paragraph 3 of the written submissions].

The decision in International Science and Technological Institute Inc. v. Rosa and

Another [(1994) 3 SrLL.R. 233] was cited in support where this Court held that when

there is an express selection by the parties of the law applicable to a foreign

contract of employment, the selected law shall be the proper law (substantive law)

governing the contract of employment.

Before addressing this point in detail, I must point out that this submission

overlooks the basic distinction between a choice of law clause and a choice of place

of jurisdiction. A choice of law clause is a clause by which the parties agree as to the

law that will govern the relationship between the parties. A law so chosen is known

as the governing law or the proper law of the contract. A choice of place of

jurisdiction on the other hand is a clause by which parties agree to the place where

any dispute between them will be adjudicated which may not be the same country

as the legal system as of the proper law.

The point raised requires a consideration of the conflict of laws rules. These can be

either codified rules such as the Rome Convention or the Convention on Jurisdiction

and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (Brussels

Convention) or common law rules. However, in Sri Lanka there is neither statutory

rules containing conflict of law rules nor have our courts developed a set of

common law rules in that area. A miniscule number of judgments appear to refer

to the conflict of law rules of English Law developed by common law rules. I am of

the view that it is apposite that the issue before Court is determined by the

application of the conflict of law rules as developed by English common law.

The contract of employment between the Petitioner and the 4 th Respondent

[P5(X2)) contains a choice of law clause which reads:

"In so far as a matter is not specifically regulated in this contract, the Contract

of Employment as per the Austrian Civil Code shall be used in addition.

Austrian public labour, social and collective bargaining law, including the

'Betriebsverfassungsgesetz' (Industrial Constitution Law) are not applicable

on principle."

The question is whether this governing law clause has the effect of preventing the

EPF Act applying to the contract of employment.

Subject to a number of exceptions the formation and validity of the contract, its

interpretation and its discharge are all governed by the governing or the proper

law. However, this general principle has several exceptions with regard to particular

types of contracts.

A contract of employment is, in general, but subject to important statutory

exceptions, governed by its proper law [Dicey and Morris on Conflict of Laws, 11th

Ed., page 1296]. The proper law of a contract of employment will determine such

questions as the terms which will be implied in the contract, the circumstances in

which the employee will be entitled to remain on the employer's premises, and to

receive wages or other forms of compensation, whether notice of termination is

effective and whether an exemption clause in the contract is valid [supra. page

1297].

However, in relation to contracts of employment and in particular social legislation

the proper law of the contract gives way to statutory provisions when they take the

form of "mandatory rules" of the forum (lex fori) . In Irish Shipping Ltd. v.

Commercial Union Assurance Co. pic [(1991) 2 QB 206, (1989) 3 All E.R. 853]

Straughton L.J. held that the intention of Parliament could be frustrated if it were

open to the parties to a contract of insurance to exclude the operation of section 1

of the Third Parties (Rights against Insurers) Act 1930 by choosing a foreign proper

law.

Accordingly, if the provisions of the EPF Act are construed as "mandatory rules" of

Sri Lanka, it applies to the contract of employment between the Petitioner and the

4 th Respondent irrespective of its governing or proper law being Austrian Law as

submitted by the Petitioner.

Cheshire and North, Private International Law, 13th Ed., pages 579-582 explains

different formulations by which the overriding effect of an Act may be ascertained

as a matter of statutory construction :

(1) The Act may expressly provide that it is to have complete overriding effect.

An example of such an English Act is the Employment Rights Act 1996 which

in section 204(1) states that for the purposes of the Act it is immaterial

whether the law governing the contract is the law of the part of the United

Kingdom or not.

(2) The Act expressly provides that it is to have limited overring effect.

The Unfair Contracts Terms Act 1977 is an example of an English Act which

by its own terms makes clear that it has only limited overriding effect.

(3) The Act expressly provides that it is to have no overriding effect.

(4) The Act has no express provision on its overriding effect but has a provision

on its territorial scope.

Where the Act has provision dealing with its territorial scope without

specifying expressly whether it is intended to have overriding effect, an

inference of its overriding effect can be more easily drawn.

(5) The Act has no express provision as to its overriding effect and no provision

on its territorial scope.

In this situation as well, it is a matter of statutory construction to ascertain

whether it has an overriding effect although this exercise is difficult in the

absence of any indication on its territorial scope.

I will now consider whether the EPF Act gives any indication of its overriding effect

to apply to the contract of employment between the Petitioner and the 4 th

Respondent despite its governing law being Austrian Law.

Scope of the EPF Act

The EPF Act applies to every person over a prescribed age who is employed by any

other person in any covered employment [Section 8(3) of the EPF Act]. Section 8(1)

of the EPF Act provides that any employment, including service of a corporation

may by regulation be declare as a covered employment.

Employees' Provident Fund Regulations, 1958 (EPF Regulations) published in

Gazette Extraordinary No. 11,573 dated 31't October 1958 as amended from time

to time specified various industries which fall within "covered employment" in Sri

Lanka.

Regulation 2 of the EPF Regulations read :

"2(1) Save as hereinafter provided in regulations 3 and 4-

(a) every employment specified in the First Schedule to these

regulations, and

(b) every employment outside Ceylon which is in connection with or

for the purposes of, the trade or business of any employer in any

employment referred to in that Schedule and which would be a

covered employment if it were in Ceylon.

shall be covered employment.

(2) Every person employed in any covered employment other than-

(a) a person holding the office of director in respect of his

employment as such director

(b) a person who is a partner in any partnership in respect of his

partnership,

(c) a person who is employed in a managerial, executive or technical

employment and for whom superannuation benefits or benefits

on termination of employment are provided under any provident

fund or pension scheme or any other fund or scheme, established

or administered outside Ceylon, and

(d) a person who is employed outside Ceylon, for the purpose of such

employment but who is not ordinarily resident in Ceylon,

shall be an employee to whom the Act applies."

The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the term "employment" in

section 8 of the EPF Act and section 2 of the EPF Regulations must be interpreted

in accordance with accepted principles of statutory interpretation so that it refers

to employment within Sri Lanka and not employment outside Sri Lanka [paragraph

4.4 of the written submissions] .

As a further extension of this submission the learned counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that the EPF Act does not apply to foreigners in view of the presumption

in statutory interpretation that statues are territorial in its application. Extracts

from Bindra, Interpretation of Statutes, 10th Ed., 195-196, Principles of Statutory

Interpretation by Justice G.P. Singh, 12th Ed., 621-623 and Maxwell on

Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Ed ., 177 was cited in support.

The contract of employment between the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent is

marked P5(X2) with the petition. It states that the country of employment is Sri

Lanka. The project/construction site is identified as Kataragama. He was employed

as a Project Manager in a project undertaken by the Petitioner consequent to a

Contract Agreement with the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of

Sri Lanka through the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. Clearly the work

that the 4th Respondent was to perform under the contract of employment was an

essential component of the larger development agenda of Sri Lanka. The claim of

the 4th Respondent for EPF dues are only for the period he worked in Sri Lanka in

terms of the contract of employment marked P5(X2). In these circumstances, it is

Page 8 of 11

illogical to argue that his employment is outside Sri Lanka merely because he is a

foreign national working for a foreign organisation.

Furthermore, in the Supreme Court decision in Blanka Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd. v. Van

Els [S.c. Appeal 52/95, S.C.M. 15.02.1996] Fernando J. (at page 5) referring to the

EPF Regulations held :

"If expatriates as a class were intended to be excluded, that might have been

done but it was not. The designated class was made wider."

It is also to be noted that the Petitioner did not at any point seek to establish that

the 4th Respondent was a beneficiary of any provident fund scheme in terms of the

Austrian Law. In fact, the governing or proper law clause appears to exclude

Austrian public labour, social and collective bargaining law, including the

'Betriebsverfassungsgesetz' (Industrial Constitution Law).

The learned counsel for the Petitioner further submitted that the intention of the

legislature can be gathered from the Hansard and that in this case the intention of

the legislature was to provide benefits only to residents in Sri Lanka in order to

provide them with some level of social security at the time of retirement or leaving

of employment for various reasons specified in the EPF Act.

It is true that in Shiyam v. O!!icer-in-Charge, Narcotics Bureau and another [(2006)

2 Sri. L.R. 156] the Supreme Court held that in case of doubt, it is competent to look

at Parliamentary debates on Acts to ascertain the intention of the law. But in this

instant, there can be no doubt given the clear statement made by the Supreme

Court in Blanka Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd. v. Van Els (supra).

Furthermore, any interpretation that the EPF Act does not apply to foreign

nationals working in Sri Lanka is counter-productive to the Sri Lankan workforce in

that it will facilitate the employment of foreign nationals in Sri Lanka at a lower cost

to the employer than employing a Sri Lankan. In any event, the Hon. Minister of

Labour, Housing and Social Services during the second reading of the National

Provident Fund Bill refers to the fact that the earlier draft of the Bill had to be

"completely re-modelled to accord with the policy of the present Government to

improve the lot of the working class" and that "this scheme is by far one of the most

important measures ever affected for the welfare of the workers" [Xl filed with

Statement of Objections, 3310]. The welfare of the working class certainly cannot

be improved by making it less costly to employ foreign nationals in Sri Lanka.

I therefore hold that the EPF Act is mandatory in nature and applies to the contract

of employment between the Petitioner an the 4th Respondent.

Waiver

The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the 4 th Respondent cannot

approbate and reprobate as he had agreed with the Petitioner that he is not

entitled to EPF. The issue is whether the application of the EPF Act can be waived

by parties to a contract of employment which otherwise falls within the EPF Act.

Section 10 (2) of the EPF Act reads:

"Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section and of section 27,

the employer of every employee to whom this Act applies and who is liable to

pay contributions to the Fund shall, in respect of each month during which

such employee is in a covered employment under such employer, be liable to

pay to the Fund on or before the last day of the succeeding month, a

contribution of an amount equal to nine per centum of such employee's total

earnings from that employment during that month." (emphasis added)

Page 10 of 11

Section 16 of the Employees Trust Fund (ETF) Act No. 46 of 1980 reads:

"The employer of every employee to whom this Act applies shall, in respect of

each month during which such employee is employed by such employer, be

liable to pay in respect of such employee, to the fund, on or before the last

day of the succeeding month, a contribution of an amount equal to 3 per

centum of the total earnings of such employee from his employment under

such employer during that month" .

In Blanka Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd. v. Van Els [(2004) 3 SrLL.R. 314 at 321] the Supreme

Court held that this provision prevented any waiver of ETF contributions by

agreement between the employer and employee. This decision was cited with

approval and followed by this Court in Ceylon Agro Industries Limited v. Employees

Trust Fund [CA(PHC) 40/2003, C.A.M. 26.02.2016].

Section 16 of the ETF Act and Section 10(2) of the EPF Act are substantially similar

in application. It is an established rule of interpretation that where there are

statutes made in pari materia, whatever has been determined in the construction

of one of them is a sound rule of construction for the other [Craies on Statute Law,

7th Ed., page 139]. In Crosley v. Arkwright [(1788) 2 T.R. 603, 608, (1788) 100 E.R.

325, 328] Buller J. held that all Acts relating to one subject must be construed in

pari materia.

Hence, I hold that the application of the EPF Act to the employment contract

between the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent cannot be waived by agreement

between parties.

For all the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the application with costs fixed at Rs.

50,000/=.
