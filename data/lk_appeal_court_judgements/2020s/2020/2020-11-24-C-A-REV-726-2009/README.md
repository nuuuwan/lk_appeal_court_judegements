The Plaintiff-Petitioners (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Petitioners") instituted this action in the District Court of Jaffna, against the Defendant-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as "the Defendants") for: -

Page 4 of 12

I.

a) A declaration that the persons who constitute the 1" Plaintiff, that is

"American IIlankai Mission" are the Bishop, Secretary and Treasurer

respectively of the Jaffna Diocese of the Church of South India.

b) A declaration that the 1", 2'd and 3rd Defendants have no right or authority

to appoint or approve the Officers of the 1" Plaintiff, that is 'American

IIlankai Mission".

c) An enjoyning order, interim injunction and permanent injunction

restraining the Defendants their agents or servants from asserting any

function or power over the 1" Plaintiff and or using the 1" Plaintiff's name

in any manner whatsoever or howsoever.

d) A stay order and an enjoying order restraining the Defendants their

servants and agents from holding any meetings for and on behalf of the 1st

Plaintiff as circulated to be held on 4th and 5th of July 2007, or on any other

dates.

The Plaintiffs' position, as stated inter-alia in the Plaint is as follows: -

a) The 1st Plaintiff that is "American Ceylon Mission" is a body incorporated

by statute under Ordinance NoA of 1908.

b) The 2,d Plaintiff is the Treasurer of the 1st Plaintiff referred to in Section 6

of the said Ordinance and was appointed to the said post at the 59th Annual

Session of the Jaffna Diocesan Council of the Church of South India and is

vested with authority to authenticate the seal of the 1st Plaintiff.

c) The 1st Defendant purports to claim to be the legal successor to the

American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions referred to in

Section 2 of the said Ordinance. The 2,d and 3rd Defendants claim to be the

President and Chief Executive of the 1st Defendant.

d) All historic accounts are unanimous in saying that the American Iliankai

Mission established in 1816 and the Jaffna Diocese of the Church of South

India (JDCSI) "merged into one" and the American Ceylon Mission and the

JDC51 a re now one body.

e) From 1947 onwards the JDCSI exercised sole control over the 1st Plaintiff

and appointed the Bishop, Secretary and Treasurer of the JDCSI as the

Officers to the post of Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer respectively of

the 1st Plaintiff at the annual sessions of the JDCSI.

f) On 21st August 2006, the Rt. Rev. Dr. Daniel Thiagarajah was consecrated

as the Bishop of the JDCSI in Chennai according to constitutional provisions.

Page 5 of 12

.

I g) The 3rd Defendant as the Chief Executive of the 1st Defendant wrote a letter

dated 3rd July 2007, which was received bye-mail directing that no changes

be made to the management structures of the 1st Plaintiff and the status quo ante to the Bishop taking office should prevail in relation to the assets

held by the 1st Plaintiff.

h) The 4 th, 5th and 6th Defendants have sent out notices of meetings of the 1st

Plaintiff to be held on the 4th and 5th of July 2007, at Christian Theological

Seminary and Uduvil Girls' College and at Manipay.

i) The 1st to the 3rd Defendants have no authority to appoint officers to

constitute the 1st Plaintiff, "American Iliankai Mission" and that even

nominations of the names to the American Board of Commissioners to

Foreign Missions referred to in Section 2 of the said Ordinance has fallen

into desuetude by 1947 and ceased to be of any force or effect.

The Learned District Judge of Jaffna in the above-styled proceedings, where on the

date of trial, prior to issues being raised, he dismissed the action of the Plaintiffs -

Petitioners on the ground that the Plaint, which was filed on 3rd August 2007, gives

the name of the 1st Plaintiff- Petitioner (herein after sometimes referred to as the 1st

Petitioner) as "American Ceylon Mission" and not "The American Ceylon Mission".

This Order was made subsequent to an enjoining order (which was later converted

into as an interim injunction being made in the said District Court action. The

Petitioners state that the Learned District Judge erred in dismissing the action of the

Plaintiff -Petitioner merely for the reason that the 1st Plaintiff- Petitioner was

purportedly not properly named as the caption did not have the word, "the".

Therefore, in this application the Plaintiff-Petitioners sought to invoke the

extraordinary Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to revise, set aside and restore the

said action, together with the interim injunction, "restraining the Defendants, their

servant or agents or any person claiming under them from asserting in any manner

whatsoever any function or power over the 1st Plaintiff and using the 1st Plaintiff's

name in any manner whatsoever or howsoever and not to hold the meetings intended

to be held on 4th and 5th of August 2007 on those days or on any other day", that was

operative.

The Petitioners state that the Defendant Respondents are in contravention of Section

22 of the Civil Procedure Code as the objection of the said identity of the 1st Petitioner

was not raised in any forum till the first day of the Trial.

Page 6 of 12

Section 22 of the Civil Procedure Code which states that;

'All objections for want of parties, or for joinder of parties who have no interest

in the action, orfor misjoinder as Co-Plaintiffs or co- Defendants, shall be taken

at the earliest possible opportunity,: and in all cases before the hearing. And

any such objection not so taken shall be deemed to have been waived by the

Defendant.'

The Petitioners moreover state that the very Act of incorporation of the 1st Petitioner

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as 'the said Act') itself refers to 'American Ceylon

Mission'. The short title to the Ordinance No.4 of 1908 that incorporated the

"American Ceylon Mission" in fact refers to the said body corporate as the "American

Ceylon Mission Ordinance". Further, sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Ordinance No.4 of

1908 consistently refers to the said body corporate as "American Ceylon Mission" and

not as "The "American Ceylon Mission.

The Plaintiff- Petitioner also states that the 1st Petitioner has been referred to as

'American Ceylon Mission' in a substantial number of following instances including

inter alia, Several Deeds in which the said incorporated body is referred to as

"American Ceylon Mission" (annexure "A22" to the Petition dated 19th October

2009),several Court records bearing numbers Nos.718/l and 719/l, thus making it

clear that it is clearly identified by this name.

Further, the Plaintiff- Petitioner claims that the identity of the 1st Plaintiff- Petitioner

is undoubtedly clear as the article 'the' makes no difference in meaning in the English

language and to the identity of the 1st Plaintiff- Petitioner, and as the article 'The' has

no equivalent in the Tamil or Sinhala language. The law has recognized that such mis-

description must be overlooked if there is sufficient certainty as to the identity of the

1st Petitioner. This is clearly recognized by the often quoted legal maxims, namely,

"Falsa demanstratian non nocet cum de corpe vel persona constat"- ( a false

description does not harm if there be sufficient certainty as to the subject- matter or

the person), and "Falsa demonstration non nocet cum de corpore vel persona constat"

- (any inaccuracy in description is to be over looked if the subject-matter of the person

is well- known).

This position is further strengthened by the case of;

Parsons Vs. Abdul Cader 42 NlR 383;

'Vellupillai Vs. Chairman, Urban Council, Jaffna 39 NlR 464;

'Bank of Ceylon Vs. Ramasamy 19B6 (1) CAlR 481;

W.M. Mendis and Co. Vs. Excise Commissioner 1999 (1) SlR 351,

Page 7 of 12

all of which lay dow~ the principle that "names in the caption of a Plaint are used only

to designate persons" .

It is thus submitted by t~e Petitioner that in light of this, the reference of "The American

Ceylon Mission" in section 2 of the said Act does not mean that the identity of the 1st Plaintiff

is solely dependent on the use of "The" and that in any event, there are several acts of

incorporation of bodies whose names sometimes have the article "The" as prefix, but in all

cases the identity of such incorporated body does not depend solely on the use of "The", to

their names.

Moreover, on a perusal of the Answer filed by the 1st to 3rd Defendants dated 28th August

2009, and the 4th to 13th Defendants dated 10th December 2007, in the District Court of Jaffna,

that it consistently refers to "the American Ceylon Mission" with the word "the" in a lower

case, regular font, and the words American Ceylon Mission being in upper case bold faced

font. It is thus clear that on their own pleadings, that the Defendant Respondents concede

that the definitive article 'the' is not necessary in order to clearly identify the Petitioner.

The 1st, 20d and 3rd Defendant Respondents state that, the Learned District Judge dismissed

the action of the Plaintiff- Petitioners, which was filed on the 3rd August 2007, gives the name

"American illankai Mission" instead of "the American Ceylon Mission" which is how the

Mission is incorporated in The American Ceylon Mission ordinance No: 4 of 1908.

While emphasizing on the importance of the correct description of the litigant, (exactness in

describing parties in adjudication) the 1st, 20d and 3rd Defendant Respondents also provide a

historical background to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions stating

that the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (hereinafter referred to as

ABCFM), was set up in Massachusetts in 1810.

In 1812 the said ABCFM set a group of Missionaries to Jaffna on 15th October 1816, where

they established the American Ceylon Mission. The abovementioned mission founded 19

churches in Jaffna by the year 1900. The properties belonging to the mission including the

churches built by the mission were held on trust by the Treasurer of "the American Ceylon

Mission". The American Ceylon Mission was incorporated by Ordinance No.4 of 1908 (Ala).

the reason for such an incorporation was for it to hold property for and on behalf of the

churches founded by the Mission.

The Plaintiff-Petitioner further states that, "On a stormy night five young men under a

haystack in Massachusetts, a body called the American Board Commission was setup in

1810 ... " The said Foreign Missions Board sent two missionaries to Jaffna, where they

established the American Ceylon Mission. In 1904 the Congregational Council of Ceylon was

established. Paragraph 8 of the Original Petition refers to the Act of 1908 No.4 where the

Page 8 of 12

American Ceylon Mission was enacted by the act of Parliament. So, it is clear, from the

Petitioner's own Pleadings that there existed two separate institutions.

The 7th Defendant -Respondent state that the 2nd Plaintiff is not a member of the

incorporated "The American Ceylon Mission" and has no right or authority to act on behalf of

"The American Ceylon Mission". Therefore the 2nd Plaintiff has no right or power to use or

authenticate the seal of the incorporated "The American Ceylon Mission" and the

incorporated The American Ceylon Mission is therefore not validly before Court. The

American Ceylon Mission has been incorporated by Ordinance No.4 of 1908 which has been

marked as 'P1(a)' The persons who constitute the body corporate of The American Ceylon

Mission are the President, Secretary and Treasurer appointed by the America Board of

Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) (

It is evident that the first Defendant-Respondent is admittedly the legal successor ofthis body.

The said Ordinance No.4 of 1908 has not been amended or repealed and remains part of the

law of this country. The American Ceylon Mission has the right to sue and be sued in that

name (section 2), to hold properties both movable and immovable (section 3) and has an

official seal which shall be authenticated by the Treasurer (section 6).

An analysis of the facts of this case has revealed to me that the American Ceylon Mission was

incorporated in 1908 as "the American Ceylon Mission" and never changed its legal character

nor its name. Therefore, the Jaffna Diocese of the Church of South India, who in this action

claims to be the "successor" to "the American Ceylon Chamber", in fact, has no connection

to "the American Ceylon Mission". The Jaffna Diocese of the church of South India has its

origins to Congregational Council of Ceylon (1904) and to the American Madura Mission who

amalgamated with the Congregational Council of Ceylon 1905. "The American Ceylon

Mission" continued to exist in parallel but as a separate and distinct entity to Jaffna Diocese

of the Church of South India.

In my opinion, in this case, the description of the Plaintiff is critical because whether the

alleged Plaintiff in fact has legal standing to litigate is based on the correct identification of

the party before Court. This is so because based on Petitioner's application (Revision

Application dated 19th October 2009), the Petitioner attempts to identify and distinguish itself

by name from amongst a number of similar entities; i.e. Churches. In such a matter the name,

style and firm must conform to the name, style and firm given to them as per their

incorporation; in this instance by an Act of Parliament, correct description of the Plaintiff is

vital because the Ordinance clearly states the name under which "the American Ceylon

Mission" is granted legal status by stating so in the Ordinance in inverted commas to read as

"The American Ceylon Mission"; i.e. when the name is put within inverted commas it is clear

that Parliament intended a specific name must be used in order to invoke the legal authority

that has been bestowed upon that title.

Page 9 of 12

It is by and on behalf of that name alone that legal proceedings can be instituted; i.e. the

authority to invoke the jurisdiction of Court on behalf of that name. It is imperative as a

preliminary matter to decide whether the proper entity is before Court. This has to be so

done even if none of the parties raises a specific objection. It is an inherent duty of Court.

In cases where the entity gets its authority to invoke the jurisdiction of Court by virtue of

incorporation through an Act of Parliament (as in this case) the Learned District Judge need

not look any further than the Ordinance itself and the Plaint (A7a - A7d). The name on the

Plaint (fact) and the name in Section 4 of the Ordinance (law) is more than sufficient to

determine such.

When the Plaintiff himself claims succession to "the American Ceylon Mission" who is not the

named Plaintiff, the Learned Judge can only reject the Plaint. The Learned District Judge

accordingly and correctly determined that "the American Ceylon Mission" incorporated by

Ordinance No.4 of 1908 is not before Court, instead a different entity on the mistaken

assumption that he is the successor to "the American Ceylon Mission" is before Court.

The Learned Judge looked at the law (i.e. Ordinance No.4 of 1908) and came to the correct

determination that "the American Ceylon Mission" has not invoked the jurisdiction of Court

by virtue of legal status granted to "the American Ceylon Mission" by an act of Parliament.

Where the Parliament itself has given that name, the name given must be used to exclude the

possibility of someone else using the same name with one part missing. The inclusion of "the"

in a name results in excluding everyone else and granting a distinct status or identity; i.e. that

person who can be a common person becomes a specific person when the word "the" is

initially before.

"American Ceylon Mission" identified as "the American Ceylon Mission" automatically refers

to the only American Mission that has been incorporated under an act of Parliament to which

the de facta Plaintiff did not succeed to.

In the Plaint of the Plaintiff-Petitioner (A7a-A7d), the 1st Plaintiff was captioned "American

lIankkai Mission", "lIankkai" is the Tamil translation for the word Ceylon. Thereby the Learned

District Judge rightfully held on the ground that "the American Ceylon Mission" was not

properly before Court. The accepted practice in these instances is to name the party correctly

by using its legal and original title (in this case "the American Ceylon Mission) and then use a

translation as an optional addition, preferably within brackets.

Therefore, I am of the view that the Learned District Judge was correct in holding that the

Plaintiff is not 'the American Ceylon Mission" and rejecting the Plaint (A7a-A7d) accordingly.

Page 10 of 12

In addressing the question whether the 1st Plaintiff has the locus Stand to Institute this action

in the name of "Iliankai American Mission", Section 2 of the American Ceylon Mission

Ordinance No.4 of 1908, created as incorporated body under the name and style of "The

American Ceylon Mission". The official Tamil Plaint states that a body titled "American IIlankai

Mission" was created and incorporated by the said Ordinance. Therefore the 1st Plaintiff in

this action is "American Iliankai Mission".

The body corporate created by this Ordinance is "The American Ceylon Mission". This

Ordinance has not been amended or replaced. The incorporated name "The American Ceylon

Mission" therefore has not been changed. The legislature has not permitted any translation,

abbreviation or any other convenient name instead of the incorporated name for the purpose

of litigation. Therefore, all action under this Ordinance must be in its corporate name and no

other. Hence proceedings instituted under the name of "American IIlankai Mission" which is

other than the corporate name, is bad in law. The "American Iliankai Mission" has therefore

no locus standi to institute this action.

It is important to note that the impugned order dated 09/10/2009, could be considered as a

Final Order as the learned District Judge has dismissed the action in limine, as the Plaintiffs

have failed to institute this action in accordance with section 2 of the Ordinance No.4 of 1908.

Against the said final order the Plaintiffs would have gone for a final appeal, instead of filing

leave to Appeal application.

The Plaintiffs have indicated 4 exceptional circumstances, in this Revision Application under

paragraph 40 of the Petition. None of those exceptional circumstances could be considered

as real exceptional circumstances to invoke the Revisionary jurisdiction of this court.

It was decided in the case of Australanka Exporters Pvt Ltd Vs Indian Bank 2001(2) SLR 156, if

the Petitioner has not urged any valid exceptional circumstances for exercising the

discretionary powers of Revision of this court, it is fatal and the Revision application should

be dismissed in limine.

In the case of Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Ltd Vs iatila Punyasiri Wijewordana and others

(unreported case) SC App. 81 of 2010, it was decided that in a case where the preliminary

objection was raised that, a revision application cannot be maintained, when the right of

appeal was available to the Petitioner. The Court held, that the Appellant has failed to exercise

the right of appeal and therefore the revision application was dismissed.

Thus, I am of the view that no sufficient reason available to interfere with the findings of the

learned District Judge.

Page 11 of12

Considering the aforesaid, I believe that the Learned Trial Judge was justified in dismissing

this action and for the foregoing reasons this Revision application is dismissed. No order for

costs.

Both parties agreed that they are bound by the judgement delivered in Revision 726/2009

and it could be applied in Leave to Appeal 04/2009, which was mentioned along with this

Revision Application.
