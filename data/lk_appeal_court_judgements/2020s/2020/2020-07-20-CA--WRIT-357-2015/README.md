Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The short point to be decided in this application is whether, at

the time material to this dispute, stamp duty payable on a share

certificate issued for a bonus issue of shares should have been

calculated on par value of the shares or on market value of the

shares. The Petitioner Company says par value, whereas the

Respondents, including the 1st Respondent Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue, say market value. The Petitioners

attempt to pay stamp duty on a bonus issue of shares on par

value was rejected by the 1st Respondent, thereby compelling the

former to pay on market value. The Petitioner made the said

payment under protest, with a claim of refund. Subsequently,

the Supreme Court, in the case of Associated Motorways PLC v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,1 held calculation of

stamp duty on share certificates at the time material to this

application shall be on par value of the shares and not on

market value. The Respondents say the said Supreme Court

decision is per incuriam and need not be followed.

The Stamp Duty (Special Provisions) Act, No.12 of 2006,

reintroduced payment of stamp duty, which had been abolished

by the Finance Act, No.11 of 2002.

Section 3(1) of the Stamp Duty (Special Provisions) Act enacts:

From and after the date of the coming into operation of this

Act, there shall be charged a duty (hereinafter to be called

stamp duty) at such rate as the Minister may determine

1 SC Appeal 40/2010, SC Minutes of 04.04.2014.

by Order published in the Gazette on every specified

instrument.

According to section 4(f) of the Stamp Duty (Special Provisions)

Act, specified instrument includes:

a share certificate on new or additional issue or on transfer

or assignment.

The Ministers Order applicable to the matter at hand was

published in Gazette No.1465/19 dated 05.10.2006. For

convenience, let me hereinafter refer to this Gazette as the

second Gazette. Item 6 thereof reads:

Any share certificate issued consequent to the issue,

transfer or assignment of any number of shares of any

company

for every Rs.1,000 or part thereof of the aggregate value of

such Number Rs. 5.00 (emphasis added)

The term aggregate value is not defined in the second Gazette.

Nor is it defined in the Stamp Duty (Special Provisions) Act or in

the Stamp Duty Act, No. 43 of 1982, as amended.

The contention of the Respondents is:

[T]he term aggregate value has no special meaning and

simply means the total value. The word value will have to

be interpreted with reference to the parent Act, i.e. the

Stamp Duty Act, which as explained above refers to the

market value.

6

Let me elaborate the position of the Respondents.

The Respondents say, as the second Gazette does not specify the

meaning of the word value, section 13 of the Stamp Duty

(Special Provisions) Act read with section 71 of the Stamp Duty

Act shall be relied on to interpret value as market value.

Section 13 of the Stamp Duty (Special Provisions) Act enacts:

From and after the date of the coming into operation of this

Act, the provisions of the Stamp Duty Act, No. 43 of 1982,

relating to the Imposition of Stamp Duty (other than any

instrument relating to the transfer of immovable property,

the transfer of motor vehicles or documents filed in Court),

Exemptions and any other provision in the aforesaid Act,

shall, in so far as the same are inconsistent with the

provisions of this Act, have no operation and the provisions

of this Act shall prevail.

Section 71 of the Stamp Duty Act, which is the interpretation

section, contains the following:

In this Act, unless the context otherwise requiresvalue

with reference (a) to any property (other than immovable

property which is gifted) and to any date, means the price

which in the opinion of the Assessor, that property would

have fetched in the open market on that date; (emphasis

added)

I find myself unable to agree with the Respondents argument

that the term aggregate value in the second Gazette has no

special meaning and it simply means total value.

7

As Maxwell2 points out Every word in a statue [is] to be given a

meaning and A construction which would leave without effect

any part of the language of a statue will normally be rejected.

Bindra holds a similar view:3

Words in a statute should not be brushed aside as the

courts always presume that the legislature inserted every

part thereof for a purpose and the legislative intention is

that every part of the statute should have effect. No words

or expressions used in any statute can be said to be

redundant or superfluous.

The word aggregate has been used in the Stamp Duty Act in

several places,4 and it may be interesting to note that in section

14(2), perhaps ironically, both total and aggregate are used in

distinction. Section 14(2) reads:

The total stamp duty chargeable in respect of the

documents filed in any proceedings in any court shall not

exceed the aggregate of the stamp duty chargeable on the

first ten documents filed by each party to the proceedings.

(emphasis added)

The Respondents submission in this regard essentially invites

the Court to replace aggregate value, which the Respondents

say is equivalent in meaning to total value, with market

value. The terms total value and market value are neither

comparable nor synonymous. Such an interpretation is, in my

2 Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition, p.36. 3 N.S. Bindras Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Edition, p.370. 4 E.g. sections 3, 13(1)(h)(iii).

8

view, completely obnoxious to the basic principles of

interpretation of taxing statutes.

I fully understand that the words for every Rs.1,000 or part

thereof of the aggregate value of such number [of shares] Rs.5.00

found in item 6 of the second Gazette is meaningless unless the

Minister specifically states how the aggregate value of such

number of shares shall be decided: whether multiplied by par

value per share or market value per share.

It is to be noted, at the time the second Gazette was in force and

when the instant share transaction took place, the concepts of

par value and market value of shares were both in existence,

although the former concept was later done away with by section

49(4) of the Companies Act, No.7 of 2007, which states No

share in a company shall have a nominal or par value.

Therefore, at the time of issuing the second Gazette, if the

Minister intended market value as the method of calculation for

stamp duty payable on a share certificate, he should have

expressly stated so.

In fact, in the immediately preceding Gazette, No.1439/1 dated

03.04.2006 (which had been in operation until it was rescinded

by the second Gazette), the Minister not only expressly refers to

market value but also states who shall determine the market

value. For convenience, let me hereinafter refer to Gazette

No.1439/1 as the first Gazette. Item 6 of the first Gazette

reads as follows:

On the issue, transfer or assignment of any share of a

company, other than a quoted public company on the

9

market value determined by the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue on the date of such issue, transfer or

assignment of such share

for each of Rs.1,000 or part thereof of such market value of

the value of the shares Rs. 5.00 (emphasis added)

The Respondents submit:

The Ministers intention was always to maintain Market

Value as the basis for valuation. The reason for market

value being expressly referred to in the first Gazette was

because that Gazette was limited to private companies

only. There is no readily available market value for those

shares. Thus the assessor had to determine the market

value. The reference to the market value was simply

additional language and had no special meaning. The

[second] Gazette was made applicable to all companies and

as such there was no necessity to specify that the Assessor

will determine the market value. Public Quoted companies

have a ready market value available.

Here again, the Respondents say The reference to the market

value was simply additional language and had no special

meaning. The Respondents made a similar submission in

respect of the word aggregate in the first Gazette. It appears

when the language is unfavourable to their position, the

Respondents say it has no meaning and can be disregarded.

This is unacceptable in interpreting statutes.

10

Why did the Minister remove the part of the first Gazette which

states the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue shall

determine the market value of the shares in order to calculate

the stamp duty payable?

The explanation of the Respondents is The [second] Gazette was

made applicable to all companies and as such there was no

necessity to specify that the Assessor will determine the market

value. Public Quoted companies have a ready market value

available.

There is no dispute that shares of public quoted companies have

a readily available market value ascertainable by their trading

price on the Stock Exchange. But what about private

companies, which have no such readily available market value

on their shares? Who shall determine the market value of the

shares of private companies under the second Gazette? Unless

the Minister specifies who shall do so, the transferor or

transferee of the shares, for instance, can also lay claim to

determining the market value in order to obtain a more

favourable rate.

The Respondents cannot say the Minister had already

manifested his intention in the first Gazette, and therefore the

taxpayer cannot be allowed to take advantage of an omission in

the second Gazette, and the practice under the former shall

continue.

11

Bindra states:5

A statute is not to be construed according to some notion of

what the legislature might have been expected to have said,

or what this court might think it was the duty of the

legislature to have said or donethe court cannot aid

deficiencies, if any, in a statute, or add or annul or by

construction make up deficiencies found in the enactment.

It is also significant to note, although section 71 of the Stamp

Duty Act states market value shall be decided by the

Assessor, the Minister in the first Gazette states market value

shall be decided by the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue. Assessor and Commissioner General are defined

separately in the Stamp Duty Act.

Given the Respondents emphasis on the fact that the shares of

private companies have no readily available market price, it

might also be relevant to note that section 19 of the Stamp Duty

Act provides for Stamp duty where value of subject-matter is

indeterminate. The said section without the proviso reads:

Where the amount or value of the subject matter of any

instrument chargeable with stamp duty cannot be

ascertained, then, subject to the provisions of section 18,

nothing shall be claimable under such instrument more

than the highest amount or value for which, if stated in an

instrument of the same description, the stamp actually used

would at the date of such execution, have been sufficient:

5 N.S. Bindras Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Edition, p.407.

12

If the argument of the Respondents is correct, the Minister could

have easily removed the part other than a quoted public

company on the market value determined by the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue on the date of such issue, transfer or

assignment of such share from the first Gazette, and left the

remaining part intact without changing the language. What is

quoted below will clearly explain what I endeavour to emphasise.

On the issue, transfer or assignment of any share of a

company, other than a quoted public company on the

market value determined by the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue on the date of such issue, transfer or

assignment of such share

for each of Rs.1,000 or part thereof of such market value of

the value of the shares Rs. 5.00

Instead, in the second Gazette, the Minister seems to have

introduced a new formula using different language. Let me

requote the same for convenience:

Any share certificate issued consequent to the issue,

transfer or assignment of any number of shares of any

company

for every Rs.1,000 or part thereof of the aggregate value of

such Number Rs. 5.00

In the second Gazette, the Minister gives prominence to share

certificate, whereas the first Gazette refers to share(s). The

inclusion of share certificate in the second Gazette is

attributable to sections 3 and 4 of the Stamp Duty (Special

13

Provisions) Act. If I may repeat, section 3(1) states From and

after the date of the coming into operation of this Act, there shall

be charged a duty (hereinafter to be called stamp duty) at such

rate as the Minister may determine by Order published in the

Gazette on every specified instrument. Section 4(f) states For

the purpose of section 3, specified instrument means - (f) a

share certificate on new or additional issue or on transfer or

assignment. Section 3(1) read with section 4(f) makes it clear

that it is the Minister who shall determine the rate of stamp

duty payable on share certificates.

The Respondents, drawing the attention of the Court to sections

15(1) and 15(4) of the Stamp Duty Act, say stamp duty on a

share certificate shall be charged on the value of the shares

conveyed. The Respondents further say the Minister can only

change the rate of stamp duty but not the basis of valuation,

and if the Minister bases his rate on par value such a gazette

would be liable to be struck down as ultra vires. Whether or not

the Minister is empowered to do so is an altogether separate

matter, which this Court is not called upon to decide in this

application. It is elementary that such a matter cannot be

decided without a hearing being given to the Minister. The

Minister is not a party to this application.

The Minister also changed the latter part of the relevant item

from the first Gazette to the second Gazette. In the first Gazette,

it is absolutely clear and unambiguous that stamp duty shall be

calculated on market value.

14

The first Gazette states:

for each of Rs.1,000 or part thereof of such market value of

the value of the shares Rs. 5.00

In the second Gazette, the above was changed to:

for every Rs.1,000 or part thereof of the aggregate value of

such Number Rs. 5.00

Why the change from market value to aggregate value? I

cannot accept the aforementioned explanation of the

Respondents in this regard. Moreover, how can the

Respondents, including the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue, speak to the intention of the Minister? If at all, the

Minister shall state what he intended.

Bindra6 states:

An amended statute remains the same statute as originally

amended, but from that proposition, it does not follow that

the law contained in the amended statute is the same law

as was contained in the original one. When the phraseology

of the law is changed by an amending Act, the presumption

will be that some change in the law is intended. It is an

ordinary rule of construction that a change of language in

the Code or Act may be presumed to indicate a change of

intention on the part of the legislature.

6 N.S. Bindras Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Edition, p.219.

15

Bindra goes on to state:7

When enacting a new law the legislature is presumed to

have had in contemplation the existing statutes on the same

subject, and to have framed its enactment in reference

thereto.

Subsequent to the second Gazette, a third Gazette, No.1864/2,

was issued on 26.05.2014. The Respondents say the third

Gazette was necessitated by the aforesaid Supreme Court

decision. The third Gazette reads as follows:

Any share certificate issued consequent to the issue,

transfer or assignment of any number of shares of any

company

For every Rs.1,000 or part thereof, of the aggregate value of

such shares being the value, which in the opinion of the

Assessor/Assistant Commissioner/Deputy Commissioner/

Senior Deputy Commissioner, that such shares would have

fetched in the open market on the date of such issue,

transfer or assignment Rs. 5.00 (emphasis added)

The third Gazette explicitly states aggregate value is market

value. The third Gazette also clearly states who shall decide the

market value, differing in this regard from both section 71 of

the Stamp Duty Act, which stipulates the Assessor shall decide

the market value, and the first Gazette, which states the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue shall so decide.

7 N.S. Bindras Interpretation of Statutes, 9th Edition, p.778.

16

In light of the third Gazette, the question that begs to be

answered is, as I have already posed, why was the language in

the second Gazette changed from market value to aggregate

value when the Minister could have left the language unaltered,

in which event there would not have been any issue at all?

The Respondents might ask, if it is not market value, is it then

par value upon which stamp duty shall be calculated on a share

certificate under the second Gazette?

I must say the contention of the Petitioner that aggregate value

means par value in the second Gazette is also not explicitly

clear to me.

However, one thing is crystal clear. Item 6 of the second Gazette

is ambiguous one interpretation favours the taxpayer, and the

other favours the tax collector. In such a situation, it is well

settled law a taxing statute shall be strictly interpreted and any

ambiguity shall be resolved in favour of the taxpayer, not the tax

collector.

Maxwell8 emphasises:

Statutes which impose pecuniary burdens are subject to the

same rule of strict construction. It is a well-settled rule of

law that all charges upon the subject must be imposed by

clear and unambiguous language, because in some degree

they operate as penalties: the subject is not to be taxed

unless the language of the statute clearly imposes the

obligation, and language must not be strained in order to

8 Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes, 12th edition, p.256.

17

tax a transaction which, had the legislature thought of it,

would have been covered by appropriate words. In a

taxing Act, said Rowlatt J., one has to look merely at

what is clearly said. There is no room for any intendment.

There is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption as

to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied.

One can only look fairly at the language used. Cape

Brandy Syndicate v. I.R.C. [1921] 1 KB 64 at 71, approved

by Viscount Simon LC in Canadian Eagle Oil Co. Ltd. v. R

[1946] AC 119. (emphasis added)

The Supreme Court in The Manager, Bank of Ceylon, Hatton v.

The Secretary, Hatton Dickoya Urban Council,9 cited the above

quotation with approval in interpreting a taxing statute in favour

of the taxpayer.

Bindra10 states:

Taxing Acts must be construed strictly. One must find

words to impose the tax, and if words are not found which

impose the tax, it is not to be imposed. If there are two

views possible, the one favourable to the assessee in

matters of taxation has to be preferred. The assessee

should be given the benefit of the doubt and the opinion

which is in its favour should be given effect to. In

interpreting a fiscal statute the court cannot proceed to

make good deficiencies if there be any; the court must

interpret the statute as it stands and in the case of a doubt,

in a manner favourable to the tax-payer. 9 [2005] 3 Sri LR 1. 10 N.S. Bindras Interpretation of Statues, 9th Edition, p.1036.

18

In Sohli Eduljee Captain (Secco Brushes Corporation) v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,11 the Supreme Court,

citing several local and foreign authorities, held:

Express and unambiguous language is indispensable in a

statute passed for the purpose of imposing a tax. In a

Taxing Statute, if two constructions are possible, one in

favour of the assessee and the other in favour of the

assessor, the Court must adopt the construction which is

favourable to the assessee.

In Perera & Silva Ltd. v. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue,12 the Supreme Court, although holding against the

taxpayer, reiterated the above in the following terms:

The law on this point is set out succinctly in C. N. Beatie -

Elements of the Law of Income and Capital Gains Taxation

at page 2;

It has frequently been said that, there is no equity in a

taxing statute. This means that tax being the creature of

statute, liability cannot be implied under any principle of

equity but must be found in the express language of some

statutory provision. The ordinary canons of construction

apply in ascertaining the meaning of a taxing statute: the

only safe rule is to look at the words of the enactments and

see what is the intention expressed by these words. If in

so construing the statute the language is found to be so

ambiguous that it is in doubt whether tax is attracted or

11 (1974) 77 NLR 350. 12 (1978) 79(2) NLR 164 at 167-168.

19

not, the doubt must be resolved in favour of the taxpayer,

because it is not possible to fall back on any principle of

common law or equity to fill a gap in a taxing statute. The

subject is not to be taxed unless the words of the taxing

statute unambiguously impose the tax upon him. However,

this does not prevent the court from construing a taxing

statute against the subject, where that appears to be the

correct interpretation of a provision the meaning of which it

may be difficult to understand. Difficulty does not absolve

the court from the duty of construing a statute; it is only

when ambiguity remains after the statute has been

properly construed that the court is entitled to decide in

favour of the taxpayer.

In Ameen v. Malship (Ceylon) Ltd.,13 the Supreme Court held

The levy of stamp duty is governed by the letter of the law and

not by its spirit.

This Court, in the case of Nanayakkara v. University of

Peradeniya,14 held The Stamp Duty Act imposes a pecuniary

burden on the people. Therefore it is subject to the rule of strict

construction.

In my view, the issue before this Court in the instant application

cannot be resolved by the simple formula presented by the

Respondents, i.e. the word value is not defined in the Stamp

Duty (Special Provisions) Act and therefore the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue is entitled to look to the Stamp Duty

Act to give meaning to the said word. 13 [1982] 2 Sri LR 483. 14 [1991] 1 Sri LR 97 at 101.

20

It is my considered view the construction most beneficial to the

taxpayer ought to be adopted in reading the second Gazette, and

therefore the ambiguity created thereby shall be resolved in

favour of the Petitioner to mean stamp duty on the share

certificate in dispute was payable on par value of the shares.

By this application, the Petitioner seeks certiorari to quash the

decision of the Respondents not to refund the excess stamp duty

paid, and mandamus to compel the Respondents to refund the

excess amount with interest.

The only substantive defence the Respondents take up in the

statement of objections is the decision of the Respondents to

refuse the refund together with the interest thereon is not contrary

to law, as that there is no breach of the express provisions of

statutory law.15 The Respondents further state [the

Respondents] have not violated any statutory duty, nor have they

failed to comply with the Supreme Court judgment.16

Having taken up such a position in the pleadings, the

Respondents for the first time at the argument came out with

myriad high-flown technical objections to defeat the Petitioners

application at the threshold level. In judicial review, we speak of

a fair hearing. Where is the fair hearing if one party to the

proceedings presents at the hearing a substantially different

case from that which he has placed on record, and which his

opponent is prepared to meet? A party shall not be allowed to

raise preliminary objections for the first time at the hearing,

15 Vide paragraph 8 of the statement of objections. 16 Ibid.

21

unless there are compelling, cogent reasons to do so. This is

one of the main causes for laws delays.

The Respondents firm position at the argument was the

Supreme Court decision is per incuriam. But the position of the

Respondents in the pleadings is different. In the statement of

objections, the Respondents say the said Judgement was

delivered by the Supreme Court on 4th April 2014 and the said

judgment was not enforced with effect from date of Stamp Duty

part payment or date of issue bonus shares and the

Respondents [have not] failed to comply with the Supreme Court

judgment.17

For the reasons I have given above, which are independent of the

Supreme Court Judgment, and in light of the decision already

arrived at, there is no necessity for me to consider whether the

said Supreme Court decision is per incuriam.

As the Respondents highlight in the written submissions, writ is

a discretionary remedy and the conduct of the parties is

intensely relevant in deciding a writ application.

One of the technical objections taken up by the Respondents is

laches on the part of the Petitioner in invoking the writ

jurisdiction of this Court. In my view, the Respondents are

guilty of laches for taking up technical objections including

laches at the point of the argument! There is no necessity to

consider the belated technical objections of the Respondents one

by one.

17 Vide paragraphs 5(1)(c) and 8(b) of the statement of objections.

22

Before I part with this Judgment, I must state, as I always do,

disposing of cases on technical grounds is easy and speedy. But

that is not what the aggrieved party expects from the Court. The

aggrieved party wants the case to be disposed of on merits

rather than on technical grounds. I fully endorse the following

observation of Justice Wigneswaran in Senanayake v.

Siriwardene:18

Courts are fast making use of technical grounds and

traversing of procedural guidelines to dispose of cases

without reaching out to the core of the matters in issue and

ascertain the truth to bring justice to the litigants. This

tendency is most unfortunate. It could boomerang on the

judiciary as well as the existing judicial system.

I grant the reliefs to the Petitioner as prayed for in paragraphs

(b)-(f) and (h) of the prayer to the amended petition.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs.
