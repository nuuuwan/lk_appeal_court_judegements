HON. JUSTICE ACHALA WENGAPPULI

The 1st, 2nd and 3rd accused -appellants were indicted before the

High Court of Matara for committing the murder of Wickramarachchi

Kankanamge jinadasa on 8th April 2005, and, in the course of the same

2

transaction, causing grievous hurt to Walpita Gamage Sriyalatha and

Wickramarachchi Kankanamge Krishna Geethanjalie, in addition to committing

robbery on each of these injured women.

Upon election by the appellants, they were tried by the High Court

without a jury. The prosecution relied heavily on the eye witness

testimony of said Walpita Gamage Sriyalatha, the wife of the deceased and

Wickramarachchi Kankanamge Krishna Geethanjalie, one of their two

daughters, in proof of the accusations that are levelled against these

appellants. At the close of the prosecution case, the trial Court ruled that

the three accused-appellants had a case to answer. The 1" and 2nd accused-

appellants have given evidence under oath while the 3rd accused-

appellant made a statement from the dock. They also called several

witnesses in support of their claims of alibi.

In delivering its judgment, the trial Court found all three accused-

appellants guilty as charged and upon being convicted they were imposed

with the death penalty in addition to the imposition of terms of

imprisonment of eight years in respect of each of the counts of grievous

hurt and robbery. They were also fined a sum of Rs. 2000.00 on each of the

grievous hurt and robbery counts, and in default, a six-month term of

imprisonment.

All three accused-appellants have filed petitions of appeal

challenging the said conviction and sentence imposed on them. At the

hearing of their appeal, learned Counsel who represented the appellants,

sought to challenge the conviction on the common ground of appeal that

the trial Court had erroneously concluded that the prosecution had proved

3

the question of identity of the accused- appellants to the required degree of

proof. The appellants have claimed before the trial Court that they were

falsely accused of these offences. Learned Counsel for the 1st accused-

appellant had explained this ground of appeal by making an additional

basis that it was a case of a" mistaken identity". The 1st and 3rd accused-

appellants also have raised another ground of appeal in support of their

appeals on the basis that the trial Court had erroneously rejected the

evidence of Sriya/atha, a vital witness for the prosecution, in convicting

them on several counts, which included an allegation of commission of a

capital offence. It is their contention that the trial Court did so in view of

the irreconcilable inconsistencies that exists between the evidence of the

mother and her daughter in their evidence thereby causing grave

prejudice to them.

The prosecution version of the sequence of events that led to the

death of the deceased is that in the evening of the day of the incident, the

deceased, Sriya/atha and Geethanjalie were watching television in the hall of

their house. At about 7.30 p.m., having heard a noise coming from outside,

the deceased went out to investigate. Geethanjalie followed her father up

to the front veranda and the deceased had proceeded to the place where

the dog was tied. After a few minutes, the deceased was brought home

held by three persons. One of them had a cap on him while the other two

had face masks made of some stretchable material to conceal their faces.

One of them had a gun with him and another had a knife. As they entered

the hall, the electric light was switched off but their black and white

television set was left on. The small red colour bulb burning in front of the

Buddha statue also provided some light. Having entered the hall and

4

switched off the lights, the intruders have then separated the deceased and

the two women, made them to sit and tied them with strips of fabric torn

off a curtain. Thereafter, two of the intruders have ransacked their

almirahs and removed any valuable items they could lay their hands on.

They also took personal jewellery items worn by the two witnesses. The

deceased pleaded with the intruders to take what they want and leave

them without causing any bodily harm.

However, at some point of time, the deceased had struggled with

the intruders and in the process the face masks worn by two of the

intruders came off. The witnesses claim they noted the physical features of

the intruders from the light of the television set and the bulb burning

before the Buddha statue. The two women joined the deceased in his

struggle and Geethanjalie was struck on her eye. Sriyalatha too had

sustained cut injuries. During this melee, one of the intruders had stabbed

the deceased repeatedly. Then they made their getaway with the items

they had robbed. The witnesses have thereafter raised cries and, as a

result, one of the sons of the deceased had rushed home and taken the

injured to hospital.

The deceased had died almost immediately due to multiple stab

injuries he had received and Geethanjalie had lost vision in one of her eyes

due to the cut injury she had sustained. Sriyalatha too had suffered a cut

injury on the frontal bone of her forehead.

Learned Counsel for the three appellants, in their collective

submissions on the common ground of appeal raised on the question of

identity, contended that one of the sons of the deceased was involved with

5

a fight a few days prior to this particular incident in which the deceased

had died. It is their contention that due to that previous animosity, the

prosecution witnesses had falsely implicated them of this crime in order to

supplement their inability to make an identification of the true assailants

that evening. The appellants sought to substantiate their contention by

placing reliance on the item of evidence that the son of the deceased, listed

as the prosecution witness No.1, but not called by the prosecution, was

the first person to make a statement to Police that very night when the

Police visited the crime scene. He had implicated only the 1st accused-

appellant at that point of time and acting on this information, the 1st

accused-appellant was arrested by the Police on the following day itself at

his residence.

The two witnesses who claimed to have identified the three

appellants at an identification parade, made their statements rather

belatedly. In fact, it was stressed by the appellants that Sriyalatha, in

narrating the incident to the examining medical officer in her short history

had stated that she identified only one person and the other two were

unknown individuals. Geethanjalie made her statement to Police only after

the arrest of three accused-appellants and after the identification parade.

It was also highlighted that; owing to the limited availability of light

and the circumstances under which the witnesses are alleged to have

identified their attackers had made their claim of identity of the attackers a

highly improbable one to accept. It is also highlighted by the appellants

that Sriyalatha had admitted that she knew at least two of the appellants,

who are also from the same village, prior to the attack on her husband but

did not mention that fact when she made statements to Police or to the

6

medical officer who had examined her. She had consistently maintained

that they were previously unknown individuals and saw them for the first

time only on the day of the incident, in her examination in chief before the

High Court.

In support of the 2nd ground of appeal, as relied upon by the l sI and

3rd accused-appellants, learned Counsel contended that owing to the

irreconcilable inconsistencies and other deficiencies of the testimony of

witness Sriyalathn, the trial Court had concluded that her evidence should

be rejected. Having rejected Sriyalathn's evidence, the trial Court had

proceeded to convict the appellants only on the evidence of Githnnja/ie.

Learned Counsel contended that the adoption of this unorthodox

approach by the trial Court was to get over the difficulty it had

encountered with, in reconciling the two conflicting versions of events as

spoken to by the two witnesses.

Learned Counsel for the appellants contended that any doubt as to

the trustworthiness or reliability of a prosecution witness should have

been resolved in favour of the appellants, but the failure to resolve any

such doubt in favour of the prosecution by rejecting Sriyalatha's evidence

by the trial Court, because it contradicted the evidence of the other witness

Githanjalie, had resulted in causing grave prejudice to the appellants. It was

also contended that the learned trial Judge who delivered the impugned

judgment, neither had the opportunity of observing the demeanour and

deportment of any of the prosecution witnesses nor the l sI and 2nd

accused-appellants or their witnesses and that fact clearly exacerbates the

error committed by the trial Court in rejecting Sriyalatha's evidence.

7

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, who appeared for the

Respondent, supported the decision of the trial Court to reject the evidence

of Sriyalatha on the basis of unreliability and contended that the appellants

have not challenged the identification parade and therefore the identity of

the three appellants were established beyond reasonable doubt. However,

no authority was relied upon by the learned Deputy Solicitor General in

support of his submissions that it was open for the trial Court to select the

evidence of one witness from the evidence of the prosecution and reject it

in the way as highlighted by the appellants in the appeal before this Court.

These several grounds of appeal, as raised by the learned Counsel

for the accused-appellants, are concerned with two important issues in

relation to evaluation of evidence. Firstly, they raised concerns over the

issue of the assessment of the testimonial creditworthiness of witnesses

Sriyalatha and Geetanjanlie, as undertaken by the trial Court on the question

of identity of the assailants. This aspect has two inbuilt components to it.

According to the 3rd accused- appellant, these witnesses have implicated

them to this murder due to their involvement in the scuffle they had with

Geeth Nadishan (PWl) a few days earlier. Then in addition, the 1st accused-

appellant claimed in his submissions before this Court it was a case of

mistaken identity.

Secondly, the accused-appellants claim that the trial Court had

selected evidence from the case for the prosecution in order to convict

them when it left out Sriyalatha's evidence from its consideration on the

basis of her evidence is "unsafe" to act upon.

8

Of these issues that had been raised at the hearing, it is proposed to

deal with the rejection of Sriyalatha's evidence by the trial Court at this

stage of the judgment, leaving the consideration of the other ground to

be considered at a later stage.

The segment of the judgment of the trial Court which gave rise to

this particular ground of appeal is reproduced below.

When the reasons that are attributed by the trial Court for leaving

out Sriyalatha's evidence as it is "unsafe" to act upon is considered, it is

noted that the Court had treated the witness as a truthful and reliable

witness and not a witness who had uttered deliberate falsehood. The trial

Court had noted consistency in her evidence over certain aspects, while

her evidence is supported or corroborated by Geethanjalie's evidence.

However, the trial Court had left out her evidence in its final analysis as it

found it is "unsafe" to act upon that evidence.

The legality of the approach taken by the trial Court in leaving out

her evidence should be examined in the light of the relevant judicial

precedents.

9

The superior Courts have consistently laid emphasis on the duty to

consider the evidence as a whole, irrespective of whether the trial was held

before a jury or Judge. In The King v Appuhamy 37 NLR 281, it is stated

that" One has to look at the whole case". A similar approach was adopted by

the Court of Criminal Appeal in King v Buckley 43 NLR 474, which

imposed a duty on the jurors that they should view the evidence as a

whole. The judgments of King v de Silva 41 NLR 337, King v Perera 41

NLR 389, The Queen v Abadda 66 NLR 397 had adopted a similar view.

In James Silva v Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 Sri L.R. 167, it was

clearly stated that;

"A satisfactory way to arrzve at a verdict of guilt or

innocence is to consider all the matters before the Court

adduced whether by the prosecution or by the defence in its

totality without compartmentalising and, ask himself

whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the

particular case, he believes the accused guilty of the charge or

not guilty."

The Supreme Court, in determining the instances where the proviso

to Section 334(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

should be applied, thought it fit to adopt the reasoning of Stirland v DPP

30 Cri App Rep 237, where Viscount Simon LC stated;

10

"A perverse jury might conceivably announce a verdict of

acquittal in the teeth of all the evidence, but the provision

that the Court of Criminal Appeal may dismiss the appeal if

they consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has

actually occurred in convicting the accused assumes a

situation where a reasonable jury, after being properly

directed, would, on the evidence properly admissible, without

doubt convict. "(emphasis added).

This being the legal position that had been clearly stated by the

superior Courts, this Court now endeavours to consider the legality of the

approach of the trial Court.

The trial Court, quite strangely did not reject Sriyalatha's evidence on

credibility. Instead it had found the witness is a truthful witness. The

prosecution relied on her evidence as well as the evidence of her daughter

to prove its case. There was no application by the prosecution under

Section 154 of the Evidence Ordinance to treat her as an witness adverse to

its case and to cross examine her in order to assail her credibility. The

prosecution had in fact relied heavily on her evidence. Therefore, her

evidence is clearly an integral part of the prosecution case.

When the trial Court had found her to be a truthful witness, that

simply means her evidence is credible. A witness is credible if his evidence

is found to be truthful as well as reliable. If the trial Court had found her

evidence is credible, then it must consider it to determine whether by that

evidence relevant facts in issue have been established.

11

A trial Court is at liberty to reject evidence of a witness on the basis

of his testimonial trustworthiness. But it cannot reject evidence of a witness

which it had found to be truthful, but "unsafe" to act. If the evidence of the

prosecution is "unsafe" to act, then that benefit should accrue in favour

of the accused. A trial Court cannot pick and choose from the

prosecution case to reach a verdict of guilt.

The Court of Criminal Appeal had frowned upon this approach of

selecting parts of the prosecution evidence in order to arrive at a finding of

guilt. In King v Buckley (supra), it was stated that;

"We are of opinion that in arriving at a verdict of guilty the

majority of the Jury must have viewed the evidence in

sections and accepted and convicted the appellant on those

parts that were satisfactory and disregarded those facts that

pointed to the improbability of the story put forward by the

Crown. The Jury should have viewed the evidence as a whole.

If they had done so, we are of opinion that they must have

had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant."

In view of the above reasoning, this Court is of the view that the

ground of appeal as raised by the 3rd accused-appellant should succeed.

Having determined merits and demerits of the said ground of

appeal, this Court should now venture to consider the other ground of

appeal which had raised concerns as to the credibility of the witness and

the question of mistaken identity.

12

The considerations that had to be applied, in relation to instances

where the identity of accused is disputed and the defence of mistaken

identity, as enunciated in the judgment of R v Turnbull & Another [1977]1

QB 224, was introduced to Sri Lanka through several judicial

pronouncements. These considerations had received further clarifications

by subsequent judgments that were pronounced both locally as well as in

England.

It is held in Sigera v Attorney General (2011) 1 Sri L.R. 201, "To apply

Turnbull principles the identification had to be made under difficult

circumstances." The judgment of Keerthi Bandara v Attorney General

(2000) 2 Sri L.R. 245 also highlighted this restriction in the applicability of

"Turnbull principles". The superior Courts also have recognised that if the

identity of the accused is disputed, then the trial Courts must first consider

whether the evidence of the witness on identity is credible. If that

evidence is credible then it should thereafter proceed to consider whether

there is a mistake made by the witness in identifying the accused. A clear

distinction was made where the witness had recognised an accused

already known to him (recognition) and the instances where he had seen

the accused for the first time at the time of the offence.

The judgment of Turnbull itself issued a caution that even in a case

of recognition, it is advisable to consider the issue whether there had been

a mistake in identifying the accused, although the witness's evidence is

truthful. Lord WidgenJ stated "Recognition may be more reliable than

identification of a stranger, but even when the witness is purporting to recognise

13

"

someone whom he knows, the jury should be reminded that mistakes In

recognition of close relatives and friends are sometimes made."

In, Beckford v R (1993) 97 Cr App R 409, Lord Lowry stated;

"The need to give the general warning even in recognition

cases where the main challenge is to the truthfulness of the

witness should be obvious. The first question for the jury is

whether the witness is honest. If the answer to that question

is yes, the next question is the same as that which must be

asked concerning every honest witness who purports to make

an identification, namely is he right or could he be

mistaken ?"

The emphasis by the English Courts on the issues that the evidence

of identity must first be credible and if it is so, then such credible evidence

should be further considered for any mistaken identity is clearly

indicative, if one carefully peruses these judgments.

The Privy Council, in its judgment of Capron v The Queen [2006]

UKPC 34, has explained this consideration in more explicit terms. It is

stated that" ... even though the defence was saying that the witnesses were lying

and was not saying that they were mistaken about the accused being the person

who shot the deceased, nonetheless the junj had to be sure that the witnesses were

telling the truth and that they were not mistaken about the identity of the person

who shot the deceased." Their Lordships have added, referring to the

functions of the jury, that" ... even if they rejected the defence position and came

14

to the view that the witnesses were telling the truth, they still had to be sure that

the witnesses were not mistaken about the identity of the killer."

A similar approach was adopted in Sri Lanka in, Keerthi Bandara v

Attorney General (supra), where this Court considered the question" If the

testimony of the prosecution witnesses is true, is this an identification effected

under difficult conditions or circums tances ?".

In Sigera v AG (supra) this Court considered the question whether

the consideration of Turnbull principles arises when the accused claims

that there is fabrication of evidence as to his identity as in the instant

appeal. The question posed by the Court was;

"The accused's position was that the charges have been

fabricated and foisted on him on account of a certain motive

which had been specifically imputed by him. Thus the

assertion of the accused in his testimony is that these charges

have been falsely and fraudulently fabricated and framed up

against him. in view of the persistent assertion of the accused

of a frame up and fabrication in regard to the charges levelled

against him, the question arises in law whether the

consideration and application of the Turnbull guide lines

ever anses for consideration In these attendant

circumstances. "

Adopting the reasoning of Regina vs Curtnel (1990) Cr. Law Review 115,

it was stated by Court that" ... where the accused asserts and alleges is not a

15

"

mistake but a frame up, no useful purpose would be served by considering the

Turnbull guide lines."

Turning to the appeal before this Court, it is noted that the lSI, 2nd

and 3rd accused-appellants have suggested to Siriyalatha that she knew all

of them prior to the incident. The witness was evasive in her answer

initially as she replied that she had left her village where she lived for over

25 years, for a four-year period, having taken up foreign employment. Yet

she admitted that she was familiar with them prior to the identification

parade but later added she came to know them after she saw them at the

parade. However, she had met them on several occasions when on her

way to the village fair and to the bus stand. She also admitted that the lsi

accused-appellant lived about '/z mile away from her house. The witness

was silent when it was suggested that some others have committed this

offence but denied when the suggestion was repeated to her for the 2nd

time.

The accused-appellants have also suggested to the witness that she

had suspected them for the murder of her husband, because they were

involved with a fight with her son, the PWl. It was also suggested to her

that soon after the incident the witness shouted a name of neighbour as

the person who had attacked them. The witness had denied the said

suggestion.

Thus, it is clear that the accused-appellants have consistently

maintained that the claim of their identity to the murder by the

prosecution witnesses is a total fabrication, owing to the prior incident

involving PWl. Given the position adopted by the lsi accused-appellant

16

, .

during the trial that he was falsely implicated, the submission that there

was a mistaken identity in the instant appeal seemed a disjointed

argument. However, the 3rd accused-appellant raised the issue of

credibility of the evidence on identity and that factor should be considered

by this Court.

Learned trial Judge who delivered the impugned judgment had no

opportunity of observing the demeanour and deportment of any of the

witnesses or the accused-appellants who gave evidence. Hence, this Court

is equally capable of assessing the evidence of the witnesses by examining

the transcript of their evidence.

It is clear that the first claim of identity of any person was made by

PW1, when the Police visited the scene that night itself. He had

implicated the 1st accused- appellant. The 1st accused- appellant was

arrested on the following day. In the absence of the evidence of PWl as to

how he implicated the name of the 1st accused- appellant, not being a

witness to the incident, should be inferred from the available evidence.

There exists at least two possibilities in the mention of the 1st accused-

appellant at the earliest opportunity. Firstly, PWl may have learnt it from

his mother. Secondly, he may have implicated the 1st accused-appellant

over the previous animosity as the appellants' claim. There is no evidence

to suggest that PW(l) had arrived home soon after the incident. The first

possibility could be discarded on the basis that Siriya/atha told her son

about the 1st accused-appellant simply because, even in the short history,

though made few days after the incident, she did not mention any name

but only said a known person. This statement is in line with the second

possibility that it was her son who first came up with the name of the 1st

17

"

accused-appellant as her short history to the medical officer merely refers

to a single person she knew among the three assailants.

The said admission of the witness, although made with reluctance

after persistent cross examination, that she knew the three accused-

appellants prior to the incident, renders the weightage that could be

attached to her claim of identifying them at the identification parade to a

negligible minimum. Her clear assertion during the examination in chief

that she saw the three accused-appellants for the first time that evening

was contradicted by herself when she admitted that she knew them prior

to the incident. Then the question arises as to why she suppressed this

factor in her evidence. Whether there was a fight between the accused-

appellants and her son or not, her suppression of this important factor in

identification seriously challenges her trustworthiness as a witness.

Situation could have been quite difficult, if she had said that she

had seen the three intruders a few times before, but is unaware as to their

names or whereabouts. It is a common experience that a person would

see another on few occasions and would recognise if seen again but yet

cannot provide names or other details.

Sriyalatha deliberately did not take that line. Instead she stated that

the accused-appellants were seen for the first time during the attack.

According to what she claim it is a case of an identification and not of

recognition. Her subsequent admission had dealt a fatal blow to her

honesty. When her honesty or truthfulness is in doubt about this important

aspect, especially when the accused-appellants challenged the claim of

18

"

identification at the identification parade, is of no value for she knew

before hand whom she expect to see and to point out at such a parade.

If Sriyalatha had not admitted that she knew the three accused-

appellants before the incident, then it would have been necessary to use

Turnbull principles to evaluate her claim of identifying the accused-

appellants under" difficult circumstances."

According to Sriyalatha the face covers the other two assailants used

to conceal their identity came off when her husband started to struggle

when the intruders attempted to tie him down. But the witness in the same

breath stated that when her husband was stabbed, his hands and feet were

already tied by the appellants using the strips of fabric ripped off from the

curtain. At that time, she too was tied along with her daughter. She also

stated that her daughter had sustained an eye injury after the stabbing of

her husband. But Geethanjali said in her evidence that she received her

injury during the struggle. If that is the case, then it is questionable for

Geethanjali to have witnessed the remaining part of the incident, owing to

this serious eye injury which resulted in losing her sight. She made a

statement to Police only after pointing out the appellants at the

identification parade. As admitted by the mother, the three accused-

appellants, being fellow villagers, she would not have had any difficulty in

pointing out, perhaps on the instructions of her brother.

The incident is no doubt a gruesome one. An innocent family who

lived peacefully was attacked and had their father killed for no reason. But

the Courts, in determining the guilt or the innocence of the accused, are

duty bound to apply the safeguards that had been put in place to prevent

19

"

any errors in identifying the real offender. The evidence of the mother and

daughter are at variance in vital points along the sequence of events they

narrated. These instances include inconsistencies in vital areas as to who

did what. After careful analysis of the evidence on the point of identity,

this Court is of the view that the evidence of the prosecution on identity is

of questionable character and therefore could not be relied upon. In the

particular circumstances of this case, applying Turnbull principles to the

evaluation of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses does not arise.

It is the view of this Court that the conviction of the three accused-

appellants should not be allowed to stand as it is not safe to do so owing to

the inherent infirmities of the evidence referred to above.

The conviction and the sentences imposed on the 1st to 3rd accused-

appellants are hereby set aside.

Accordingly their appeals are allowed.
