RESPONDENTS Before: Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Chrishmal Waransuriya with Ms. Kumudini Hettiarachchi for the Petitioner Ms. Nayomi Kahawita, Senior State Counsel for the Respondents Argued on: 19th June 2019, 26th September 2019 and 19th December 2019 Written Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 24th May 2019, 5th February 2020, and 16th June 2020. Tendered on behalf of the Respondents on 18th June 2019 and 13th May 2020 Decided on: 22nd June 2020

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner, having obtained a Bachelor of Science Degree (B.Sc) in

Mathematics with First Class Honours from the 1st Respondent, University of

Colombo, had joined the 1st Respondent as a Temporary Assistant Lecturer in

January 1986. In August 1986, the Petitioner had proceeded to the Ohio State

University, USA, where he completed his Master of Science Degree (M.Sc) in

Mathematics, obtaining a GPA of 3.8. The Petitioner had subsequently been

awarded the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D) in Pure Mathematics by the

University of Memphis, USA, after securing a GPA of 4.0.

By letter dated 17th January 2000, annexed to the petition marked P1, the

Petitioner had been appointed as a Senior Lecturer, Grade II in the Department

of Mathematics of the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner continues to serve the

1st Respondent in the capacity of a Senior Lecturer.

The Petitioner had submitted an application dated 30th October 2016, annexed

to the petition marked P5, seeking promotion to the post of Associate

Professor / Professor. Being apprehensive that his application was not being

considered by the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner filed this application on 26th

March 2018 seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to

determine his application according to law.

However, by letter dated 14th May 2018, annexed to the petition marked P15,

the 1st Respondent had made available to the Petitioner the marks assigned to

him by one of the Panels that was appointed to evaluate his application. With

4

the permission of this Court, the Petitioner thereafter filed an amended

petition on 4th June 2018, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari quashing those parts of the decision of the Senate

Appointed Panel, as reflected in the annexure to the letter marked P15,

not to allot 4 marks for Section 3.2;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to determine according

to law, the Petitioners appointment for the post of Professor / Associate

Professor.

Pursuant to the filing of this application, the Petitioner and the 1st Respondent

had exchanged correspondence relating to the subject matter of this

application, culminating in the 1st Respondent informing the Petitioner, by

letter dated 3rd September 2018, marked R8, that the Council at its meeting

held on 10th July 2018 noted that you have not obtained the minimum required

marks for Section 3.0 of your application. Therefore, the Council decided not to

promote you to the post of Associate Professor / Professor.

The 1st Respondent had further informed the Attorney-at-Law for the

Petitioner by letter dated 1st February 2019 that, the Council at its meeting

held on 19th December 2018 having considered the provisions of Commission

Circular No. 916 and Establishments Circular Letter No. 4/2010 issued by the

University Grants Commission, decided not to promote Dr. Jayawardena to the

post of Associate Professor/Professor and to stick to the earlier decision of the

Council at its 539th meeting held on 9th August 2018.

5

These two letters have been annexed to the motion dated 13th February 2019,

marked as P17 and P18, respectively. In view of P17 and P18, the

Petitioner has sought to amend the above prayer for the aforementioned Writ

of Certiorari, by referring to P17 and P18 as reflecting the decision not to

grant him the appointment as Associate Professor / Professor.

Are academic issues outside the jurisdiction of this Court?

The issue that this Court must decide in this application is whether the decision

of the 1st Respondent not to appoint the Petitioner to the post of Associate

Professor / Professor is illegal, irrational or unreasonable.

In considering the above issue, this Court would first like to lay down the

parameters within which Courts have previously acted when faced with

decisions by academic institutions, especially since this is a matter on which a

great deal of emphasis has been placed by the learned Senior State Counsel in

resisting this application.

In Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth1, it has been pointed out that

Courts will be reluctant to enter into issues of academic or pastoral judgment

which the University was equipped to consider in breadth and in depth but on

which any judgment of the Courts would be jejune and inappropriate. That

undoubtedly included such questions as what mark or class a student ought to

be awarded or whether an aegrotat was justified."2

1 H.W.R. Wade, C.F, Forsyth, Administrative Law [11th Edition, 2014] Oxford University Press, page 537. 2 Clark v. University of Lincolnshire and Humberside [2000] 1 WLR 1988, as referred to in Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth (supra).

6

In Abeysundara Mudiyanselage Sarath Weera Bandara vs University of

Colombo and others3, having considered several English cases in this regard,

this Court held as follows:

The consistent judicial opinion, therefore, is that in matters which lie

within the jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities,

the Court has to be slow and circumspect before interfering with any

decision taken by them in connection therewith. Unless a decision is

demonstrably illegal, arbitrary and unconscionable, their province and

authority should not be encroached upon. This is mainly because of want

of judicially manageable standards and necessary expertise to assess,

scrutinise and judge the merits and/or demerits of such decisions.

Dealing with the scope of interference in matters relating to orders passed

by the authorities of educational institutions, the Courts should normally

be very slow to pass orders in regard thereto and such matters should

normally be left to the decision of the educational authorities."

In Dr. Karunananda v. Open University of Sri Lanka and Others,4 the Supreme

Court was called upon to consider whether the petitioners fundamental rights

guaranteed under Article 12(1) had been infringed by the refusal of the Open

University to promote the petitioner as a Professor. In the said case, the

Supreme Court was confronted with an argument on behalf of the University

that the decision whether to confer a professorship could be executed only by

persons who are qualified and placed in equal or higher standing and

accordingly, an application seeking appointment as a Professor, could only be

3 CA (Writ) Application No. 844/2010; CA Minutes of 8th June 2018. 4[2006] 3 Sri LR 225; at pages 236 - 237.

7

assessed by similarly qualified peers from the academic community having an

'academic mind' and that such evaluations may not be on par with the

reasoning of a judicial mind. In response to the said argument, the Supreme

Court held as follows:

Therefore, although there may be cautionary remarks indicating

reluctance to enter into academic judgment, I am not in agreement with

the view that academic decisions are beyond challenge. There is no

necessity for the Courts to unnecessarily intervene in matters "purely of

academic nature," since such issues would be best dealt with by

academics, who are 'fully equipped' to consider the question in hand.

However, if there are allegations against decisions of academic

establishments that fall under the category stipulated in terms of Article

126 of the Constitution, there are no provisions to restrain this Court from

examining an alleged violation relating to an infringement or imminent

infringement irrespective of the fact that the said violation is in relation to

a decision of an academic establishment.

Of course, the above position is a restatement of the approach adopted by

Courts when exercising judicial review of administrative decisions, as pointed

out in the following passage from Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth:5

The doctrine that powers must be exercised reasonably has to be

reconciled with the no less important doctrine that the court must not

usurp the discretion of the public authority which Parliament appointed to

take the decision.

5 Supra; page 302.

8

Decisions which are extravagant or capricious cannot be legitimate. But if

the decision is within the confines of reasonableness, it is no part of the

courts function to look further into its merits.

As Lord Hailsham L.C. has observed, two reasonable persons can perfectly

reasonably come to opposite conclusions on the same set of facts without

forfeiting their title to be regarded as reasonable.6 Similarly Lord Diplock has

observed that, the very concept of administrative discretion involves a right to

choose between more than one possible course of action upon which there is

room for reasonable people to hold differing opinions as to which is to be

preferred. 7 As such, the test to be applied is not what a court of law thinks or

considers is reasonable nor what the proverbial Man on the Clapham Omnibus

would consider reasonable. Instead, it is settled law that in considering the

validity of the exercise of discretionary power, the Court will consider whether

the power has been properly used, or abused. In the words of Lord Bingham,

they (judges) are auditors of legality; no more, but no less.8

This Court is therefore of the view that while due recognition will be given to

the view of the decision maker, whether the decision relates to academic

matters or otherwise, this Court can, and will, in the exercise of the jurisdiction

vested in it by Article 140 of the Constitution, examine whether the impugned

decision of the 1st Respondent is tainted with illegality, irrationality or

procedural impropriety. This Court would however exercise extreme caution if

asked to consider, for example as in this case, whether a decision of a selection

board or panel to award less marks than what a petitioner claims is rightfully

due, is irrational or unreasonable.

Circular governing appointment of Associate Professor and Professor P3

The starting point in the consideration of the issue before this Court is Circular

No. 916 dated 30th September 2009 annexed to the petition marked P39. By

this Circular, the University Grants Commission had approved the scheme of

recruitment contained therein for the posts of Associate Professor, Professor

and Senior Professor in the University System. It is observed that the scheme

of recruitment set out in Circular No. 916, which is effective from 1st October

2009, seeks to ensure uniformity in the selection of persons to be promoted to

the posts of Associate Professor, Professor, and Senior Professor across all

Universities in Sri Lanka.

According to Circular No. 916, a Senior Lecturer Grade I or Grade II may be

considered for promotion to the post of Associate Professor or Professor if he

or she has obtained the minimum mark specified in the marking scheme

contained in the said Circular. The marking scheme for selection to the posts of

Associate Professor and Professor has been set out in Part 4 of the Annex to

the said Circular and contain three sections under which a candidate is marked.

Part 4 also specifies the minimum mark that a candidate is required to obtain

for each section and the minimum aggregate mark that an applicant should

obtain in order to qualify for the relevant appointment. Thereafter, qualified

applicants will be subject to the selection process.

9 This circular has been amended by Establishments Circular Letter No. 4/2010 marked P4.

10

Details of the aforementioned sections and the minimum marks that should be

obtained are set out in the following table.

Section Description Minimum mark for Associate Professor

Minimum mark for Professor Section 1 Contribution to teaching and academic development

10 20

Section 2 Research and creative work

25 50

Section 3.1 Section 3.2 Section 3.3

Dissemination of knowledge Awards Contribution to University and National Development

10 10

Total minimum mark

70 105

This Court must note that each of the above Sections have been sub-divided

into several sub-sections and that the Circular contains a detailed marking

scheme for each of the sub-sections, including the marks that should be

allotted for each such sub-section.

In terms of Circular No. 916, an application for merit promotion should be

accompanied by the following:

a) Curriculum vitae of the applicant;

11

b) A self assessed application of the applicants whole career specifying the

contribution made in respect of each of the above sections;

c) Three copies of the publications, research papers and other relevant

documents;

d) Titles of three outstanding research papers/publications by the candidate.

This Court must observe that the method of evaluation is different to the

traditional system, in that the applicant makes an assessment of himself, with

supporting documents, and specifies the marks that he or she is claiming for

each sub-section.

Under the heading, Method of Evaluation, the Circular sets out the manner

of evaluating each application that is received by the relevant University.

Accordingly, the Senate shall appoint two External Experts in the relevant field

from outside the higher educational institution concerned, to evaluate the

applicants contribution under Sections 2 and 3.1. Both experts shall be Senior

Professors or Professors of a University in Sri Lanka or a recognized University

abroad. For convenience, this Court shall refer to the External Experts as the

Experts Panel.

The evaluation of the applicant under Sections 1, 3.2 and 3.3 is carried out by a

panel appointed by the Senate consisting of three Senior Professors or

Professors with speciality in the relevant field. The Dean of the relevant Faculty

shall function as its Chairman. Whenever possible, the said Panel, which this

Court shall refer to as the Senate Appointed Panel, should include at least

one person from outside the University to which the applicant belongs, and

12

one person from the same University but from outside the Faculty to which the

applicant belongs. The Circular requires the Senate Appointed Panel, while

allocating marks, to submit a report to the Selection Committee regarding the

applicants teaching ability, service to the University, profession, industry,

national development, community etc, and leadership qualities.

Under the heading Method of Selection, the Circular P3 makes it clear that

selection shall be by a Selection Committee consisting of the following:

a) The Vice Chancellor of the University, who shall be the Chairman.

b) Two nominees appointed by the University Grants Commission;

c) Two nominees of the University Council who were appointed to the

Council by the University Grants Commission;

d) Head of the relevant Department;

e) Two Senior Professors / Professors appointed by the Senate from among

its members with knowledge of the subject at least at degree level.

The Circular P3 goes on to state as follows:

Candidates with the required qualifications shall be requested to appear

before a Selection Committee. .... Every applicant shall appear before the

Selection Committee and make a presentation on his/her main area of

research or creative work. Audio visual, multimedia facilities etc may be

provided for the presentation. This may be followed by a discussion with

13

the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee shall arrive at a score

on a scale of 10 for a candidates presentation skills.

This Court observes that the University Grants Commission has issued

Establishments Circular Letter No. 2/2011 dated 14th February 2011, marked

R4 under the heading, Selection procedure for appointment to the post of

Associate Professor/ Professor. Paragraph 4 thereof reads as follows:

The Commission further decided that the Selection Committee should not

change or alter the marks given by the external reviewers as well as the

internal panel. Yet, the Selection Committee could examine all the relevant

documents relating to the evaluation process of the application/s

submitted by candidate/s and a recommendation could be made for

appointment of a third reviewer if it feels necessary. On receipt of

comments from a third evaluator a final decision should be reached by

the Selection Committee following the guidelines in the marking

scheme.

The provisions of the above Circulars, P3 and R4 can thus be summarised as

follows:

a) The scheme of evaluation set out in Circular No. 916 seeks to ensure that

an application for the post of Associate Professor or Professor is

evaluated by those persons who have the expertise in the relevant

discipline as that of the applicant or has knowledge of the work carried

out by the applicant.

14

b) A distinction is drawn between evaluation and selection. Thus, the role of

the Experts Panel and the Senate Appointed Panel is to carry out an

extensive evaluation of the application, and submit its evaluation sheets

and reports to the Selection Committee.

c) The task of selection is with the Selection Committee. The said Committee

would have the benefit of the aforementioned evaluation sheets and

reports, as well as the opportunity of listening to the applicant, whenever

the applicant has qualified by scoring the minimum marks. If it so desires,

the Selection Committee can seek a fresh evaluation from a third expert

reviewer.

d) It is the view of this Court that the final decision whether to promote an

applicant to the post of Associate Professor / Professor is a decision that

must be taken by the Selection Committee. Of course, in doing so, the

Selection Committee shall follow the guidelines in the marking scheme

contained in P3.

This Court, in Dr. Chelliah Elankumaran vs University of Jaffna and others10

was called upon to consider whether the Selection Committee had the power

to reduce marks given by the Experts Panel or the Senate Appointed Panel.

Having considered the provisions of Circular No. 723, which was the Circular

applicable to that application, and in terms of which the evaluation and

selection had been carried out, this Court held as follows:

The Petitioners complaint is that the Selection Committee does not have

the power to adjust or alter the marks given by the External Experts or the

10 CA (Writ) Application No. 147/2013; CA Minutes of 17th May 2019.

15

Panel. What then is the role of the Selection Committee? Circular No. 723

sets out that the final selection shall be made by the Selection Committee

based on the evaluation reports and in conformity with the procedure of

appointment. This Court is of the view that the Selection Committee

cannot merely rubber stamp the marks given by the External Experts

and the Panel and that the Selection Committee must have the power to

examine the marks given by each of the experts and the panel, and

where necessary make adjustments. However, this Court is mindful that

granting the Selection Committee the power to make any adjustment it

wishes would render nugatory the object that is sought to be achieved by

having experts to review an application for Professor. Either way, this

Court is of the view that Circular No. 723 does not contemplate a complete

re-assessment of Sections 2 and 3.1, as in the instant case.

Therefore, it is imperative that the right balance is struck between the

two. This Court is of the view that where there are any inconsistencies

which are of a non-academic nature, or any glaring errors in the marks

given by the experts or the panel, the Selection Committee has the

power to rectify such errors or inconsistencies. However, where any

adjustments are carried out, this Court is of the view that the Selection

Committee must set out the reasons for such adjustment and if required,

provide to Court the basis on which the marks given by the experts was

adjusted. Furthermore, where the Selection Committee is of the view that

adjustments need to be made in respect of marks given on academic

issues, it is prudent that the Selection Committee consults the External

Experts and arrive at a consensus which addresses the concerns of the

Selection Committee.

16

While the above reflects the position under the Circular that was applicable in

that application, Circular No. 916 marked P3 read together with Circular R4

on the face of it appears to effectively shut out the Selection Committee from

adjusting the marks allotted to a candidate. However, the use of the words, a

final decision should be reached by the Selection Committee following the

guidelines in the marking scheme in R4 makes it clear that the final decision

of selection must be with the Selection Committee, and that it cannot abdicate

the powers conferred on it, by merely accepting whatever marks allotted to a

candidate by either the Experts Panel or the Senate Appointed Panel.

Evaluation of the Petitioners application

This Court shall now consider the outcome of the evaluation carried out by the

Experts Panel and the Senate Appointed Panel.

The learned Senior State Counsel appearing for all Respondents submitted that

the application of the Petitioner has been evaluated in terms of Circular No.

916 marked P3. The 1st Respondent had accordingly appointed Professor

D.D.S.Kulatunga, Department of Mathematics, University of Kelaniya, and

Professor A.A.I.Perera, Professor in Mathematics, Department of Mathematics,

University of Peradeniya as the two External Experts. In terms of expertise,

there can be no doubt that the members of the Experts Panel possessed the

competence to evaluate the application of the Petitioner. The evaluation

reports of the said Experts were not made available to this Court along with

the Statement of Objections. However, after the conclusion of oral

submissions, the evaluation reports were made available to this Court by way

of a motion dated 12th December 2019, marked R14, and R15.

17

The marks allotted by the Experts Panel for Sections 2 and 3.1 are set out

below.

Name of Expert Report Section 2 Section 3.1

Professor D.D.S.Kulatunga R14 76.95 3.00 Professor A.A.I.Perera R15 58.75 2.50 Average marks 67.85 2.75

The Senate Appointed Panel had consisted of four persons including the 19th,

27th and the 28th Respondents. According to the summary of the marks given

by the Panel, annexed to the amended petition marked P15 the Senate

Appointed Panel had allotted the following marks to the Petitioner:

Section Marks

1 34 Section 3.2 02 Section 3.3 04

In addition to the allocation of marks, the Senate Appointed Panel under the

heading, Report of the Selection Committee, had stated that the Petitioner

presented the topic well. He has good teaching skills. Presentation is

satisfactory.

The marks assigned by the Experts Panel and the Senate Appointed Panel can

thus be summarised as follows:

18

Section Minimum marks for Associate Professor

Minimum marks for Professor

Marks scored by the Petitioner

Section 1 10 20 34 Section 2 25 50 67.85 Section 3.1 Section 3.2 Section 3.3 Total for Section 3

10

10

2.75 2 4 8.75 Total minimum mark

70 105 110.6

Thus, even though the Petitioner had secured sufficient aggregate marks for

appointment to the post of Professor, the Petitioner had failed to obtain the

minimum marks required for Section 3, thus disqualifying him from presenting

himself before the Selection Committee to be considered for selection and

appointment to the post of Associate Professor / Professor.

The role played by the Selection Committee

Even though the Petitioner had not been interviewed by the Selection

Committee, the reports of the two panels had been considered by the

Selection Committee, which comprised of the 2nd Respondent, who at that

time was the Vice Chancellor of the 1st Respondent, and the 19th 26th

Respondents, at a meeting held on 24th January 2018. This Court must observe

19

at this stage that even though the 19th Respondent functioned as a member of

the Senate Appointed Panel, and the 21st Respondent functioned as an

observer at the Senate Appointed Panel, and therefore should not have sat on

the Selection Committee, the Petitioner has not raised any issue before this

Court in this regard. This Court however feels very strongly that the

membership of the Selection Committee must be kept distinct and separate

from the Experts Panel and the Senate Appointed Panel, in order to ensure the

integrity, independence and transparency of the selection process.

The decision of the Selection Committee, as borne out by its report marked

R2 is as follows:

The Committee decided to send to the third reviewer for evaluation of

Section 2 and 3.1, as per Establishment Circular Letter No. 2/2011.

Further, the Committee noted no marks allocated for University Awards in

Section 3.2. Hence, it was decided to seek clarification from UGC whether

this could be rectified.

In his affidavit to this Court, the 2nd Respondent has stated that the above

decision was taken in order to rectify the marks that had been given.11 The

learned Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted, and it is in fact the

understanding of this Court as well, that the above Statement of the 2nd

Respondent confirms that the Selection Committee too shared the concerns

that the Petitioner has now presented to this Court.

11 Vide paragraph 6(i) of the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent.

20

The Selection Committee has not made any adjustments to the marks given by

either of the Panels, although their discomfort with the marks allotted is

clearly reflected in R2 and the steps that were taken thereafter, namely the

appointment of the third external reviewer, and in seeking clarification from

the University Grants Commission.

The response of the University Grants Commission is as follows:12

Please note that only in the case of marks given by the subject experts an

option has been given to appoint a third subject expert, where one of the

two outside subject experts gives marks above the maximum threshold to

a candidate and the other does not according to the table given in section

4.0 of the Establishments Circular Letter No. 4/2010 dated 19th March

2010.

However there is no provision available in the said Circular to rectify the

marks given by the evaluation panel appointed by the Senate to evaluate

Section 1, 3.2 and 3.3 of the marking scheme for the posts of Associate

Professor / Professor.

It is regrettable that the University Grants Commission took this narrow view,

especially since R4 itself confers the Selection Committee with the power to

make the final decision by following the guidelines in the marking scheme. The

resultant position, which would be discussed later, is that any error of the

Senate Appointed Panel cannot be rectified by the Selection Committee

however glaring that error may be.

12 Letter dated 18th April 2018 annexed to the motion dated 12th December 2019, marked R12.

21

The recommendation of the Selection Committee to appoint a Third Expert

Reviewer had been approved by the Senate of the 1st Respondent. Accordingly,

Professor P.A.Jayantha, Professor of Mathematics and Dean, Faculty of

Science, University of Ruhuna had been appointed as the Third Expert to

review Sections 2 and 3.1.

After the receipt of the report of the Third External Reviewer, the Selection

Committee had met on 10th July 2018. The learned Senior State Counsel has

placed before this Court the single page report of the Selection Committee

marked R7, according to which, the Selection Committee has taken the

average of the marks assigned by Professor D.D.S.Kulatunga and Professor

Jayantha and given the Petitioner the following marks:

Section Marks

1 34 Section 2 65.63 Section 3 09 Total 108.63

Apart from the re-calculation of the marks given for Sections 2 and 3 i.e. by

taking the average of the marks allotted by Professor Kulatunga and Professor

Jayantha it is the view of this Court that the Selection Committee has not

carried out the selection that is expected of it. This Court must reiterate that

even though the Selection Committee was concerned with the non-allocation

of marks due to the Petitioner by both panels, it was constrained by the

decision of the University Grants Commission that there is no provision to

rectify the marks given by the Senate Appointed Panel. As already noted, the

University Grants Commission has failed to appreciate that Circular R4 clearly

22

empowers the Selection Committee to reach the final decision, as evidenced

by the final sentence of the final paragraph of R4.

The final position was that even though the Petitioner had obtained the

aggregate marks required for appointment as Professor, he had not obtained

sufficient marks for Section 3, which disentitled him from being promoted

either as Associate Professor or Professor. It is in the above circumstances that

the 2nd Respondent informed the Petitioner by P17 of the decision of the

Council that he is not eligible for promotion to the post of Associate Professor /

Professor.13

Grievance of the Petitioner with regard to the marks allotted for Section 3

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that while he has no

grievance with the marks allotted for Sections 1, 2 and 3.3, he is aggrieved with

the non-allotment of marks claimed by him for Sections 3.114 and 3.2.15 The

Petitioner stated that even though he requested the 1st Respondent to inform

him the reasons for such non allocation, and even though he has specifically

raised issue in this regard in the petition, the Respondents have failed to

provide, at least to this Court, the reasons why the Experts Panel and the

Senate Appointed Panel had not allotted marks claimed by the Petitioner in his

self assessed application.

13 P17 has been produced by the Respondents marked R8. 14 Under Section 3.1, the Petitioner had claimed six marks for a book written by him but he had been allotted only three marks. 15 Under Section 3.2, the Petitioner had claimed four marks for two awards but he had only been allotted two marks.

23

Duty to give reasons

The complaint of the Petitioner can therefore be narrowed down to a failure to

provide reasons for non-allotment of marks for Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The

starting point in considering this complaint is to consider whether the

Respondents were under a duty to provide the Petitioner with reasons for its

decision.

Although traditionally, English common law does not recognise a general duty

to give reasons for administrative decisions,16 it is becoming increasingly clear

that Courts consider the duty to give reasons as an indispensable part of a

sound system of administrative justice. As observed in De Smiths Judicial

Review17, what were once seen as exceptions to the rule which stated that

reasons were not required, are now becoming examples of the norm; while the

cases where reasons are not required may be taking on the appearance of

exceptions.

The position taken by the Supreme Court in recent times is overwhelmingly in

favour of the duty to give reasons. The duty to give reasons for a decision has

been exhaustively dealt with by the Supreme Court in Hapuarachchi and

Others v. Commissioner of Elections and Another18 where it was held as

follows:

of the 20th century clearly indicates that despite the fact that there is no

general duty to give reasons for administrative decisions, the Courts have

regarded the issue in question as a matter affecting the concept of

procedural fairness. Reasons for an administrative decision are essential

to correct any errors and thereby to ensure that a person, who had

suffered due to an unfair decision, is treated according to the standard of

fairness. In such a situation without a statement from the person, who

gave the impugned decision or the order, the decision process would be

flawed and the decision would create doubts in the minds of the aggrieved

person as well of the others, who would try to assess the validity of the

decision. Considering the present process in procedural fairness vis-a-vis,

right of the people, there is no doubt that a statement of reasons for an

administrative decision is a necessary requirement."

In Jayantha Liyanage vs Commissioner of Elections19, the Supreme Court held

as follows:

Any act of the repository of power, whether administrative or quasi-

judicial, is open to challenge if it is in conflict with the governing Act or the

general principles of law of the land or is arbitrary and unreasonable that

no fair minded authority could ever had made it. The recording and giving

of reasons therefore ensures that the decision of the repository of power is

reached according to law and not on the basis of caprice, whim or fancy.

A person seeking to register his party as a recognized political party is

ordinarily entitled to know the grounds on which the Commissioner of

Elections has rejected his claim. If the decision of the Commissioner of

Elections is subject to appeal or judicial review, the necessity to give

19 SC Appeal No. 96/2011; SC Minutes of 17th December 2014.

25

reasons is greater, for without reasons, firstly, the persons aggrieved by

the decision of the Commissioner of Elections would not be in a position to

formulate the legal basis on which he could challenge such decision by

way of appeal or judicial review. Secondly, the appellate authority would

not have any material on which it may determine whether the facts were

properly ascertained, the relevant law was correctly applied and the

decision was within the parameters of the Commissioner of Elections.

The above position was reiterated by the Supreme Court in Jayaweerage

Sumedha Jayaweera vs Professor Dayasiri Fernando and Others20 where Chief

Justice Sripavan held as follows:

Giving of reasons is an essential element of administration of justice. A

right to reasons is, therefore, an indispensable part of a sound system of

judicial review. Reasoned decision is not only for the purpose of showing

that the citizen is receiving justice, but also a valid discipline for the

administrative body itself. Conveying reasons is calculated to prevent

unconscious, unfairness or arbitrariness in reaching the conclusions. The

very search for reasons will put the authority on the alert and minimize

the chances of unconscious infiltration of bias or unfairness in the

conclusion. The duty to adduce reasons will be regarded as fair and

legitimate by a reasonable man and will discard irrelevant and extraneous

considerations. Therefore, conveying reasons is one of the essentials of

justice (Vide S. N. Mukherjee Vs. Union of India (1990) 4 S.CC.C. 594; A.I.R.

1990 S.C. 1984).

20 SC (FR) 484/2011; SC Minutes of 16th January 2017.

26

It is the view of this Court that procedural fairness and good administration

demands that a party who is adversely affected by a decision of an

administrative body is made aware of the reasons for such a decision.

Particularly where the affected party has a right of appeal or where the

decision is amenable to judicial review, reasons for the adverse decision would

be essential to allow such party to ascertain whether there is a justiciable flaw

in the decision making process, and whether they have sufficient material to

institute legal action.

Duty to give reasons the three tiered approach

Given the facts of this application, the duty to give reasons can be split into

several components and examined on a tiered basis, with all tiers however

being inter-connected. The first tier would be whether the evaluators, namely

the Experts Panel and the Senate Appointed Panel were under a duty to

substantiate the allotment/ non-allotment of marks in their reports submitted

to the Selection Committee. The second tier is whether the 1st Respondent was

required to provide reasons to the Petitioner at the time it informed the

Petitioner that his application has been rejected. The third and final tier is

whether the 1st Respondent was under a duty to provide this Court with

detailed reasons for its decision, once this Court, being satisfied that the

Petitioner had established a prima facie case, issued formal notice of this

application on the Respondents. Of course one would see that the reasons in

the first tier should ultimately be the reasons for the second and third tiers,

except where the Selection Committee has amended the marks allotted by

either of the panels, in which event, the reasons of the Selection Committee

27

would be an additional tier, and also form part of the reasons assigned at the

second and third tier.

Duty to give reasons - The first tier

This Court has already observed that the marking scheme in Circular P3 has

been set out in great detail, with each section being divided into several sub-

sections and the marks that are to be given for each sub-section being clearly

specified. Unlike in a traditional marking system, where a panel would allot

marks, under P3, an applicant is required to submit a self evaluated

application of himself or herself, indicating to the members of the two Panels,

the marks that are sought by the applicant for each sub-section and the reason

why such marks are sought. This requires the evaluators to be specific with the

marks that are given, and record the non-allotment of marks that have been

claimed by the applicant in the self-assessment. In other words, the members

of the two panels must evaluate objectively, and be specific with their

evaluation.

It is the view of this Court that requiring the members of the Panels to be

specific is not too much to ask, for three reasons. The first is the fact that the

members of the Experts Panel, and the Senate Appointed Panel are highly

qualified academics and Professors who have the required knowledge and

expertise to evaluate an application for Professorship. The second is that the

evaluators are not constrained by time or by the sheer volume of applications,

and therefore, there is no undue hurry to conclude the evaluations in a day or

two. The third reason is that an applicant, once rejected, cannot re-apply for a

period of two years from the date of the first application. In the above

28

circumstances, it is the view of this Court that it is paramount that reasons as

to why an applicant is not being allotted the marks that have been claimed in

the self assessed application must be recorded by the Panels in the reports

that are submitted by such Panels to the Selection Committee. An evaluation

which does not follow such standards would be a sham.

This Court will now proceed to consider whether the members of the two

Panels have substantiated the allotment / non-allotment of marks in their

reports submitted to the Selection Committee.

Marks allotted by the Senate Appointed Panel

The Petitioners first grievance is with regard to the marks allotted by the

Senate Appointed Panel for Section 3.2 of the Circular P3, titled Awards,

which reads as follows:

Special Academic/Professional Awards or recognized

Academic/Professional Distinctions

Upto 2 points per

award.

10 marks maximum

In his self assessed application, the Petitioner had sought 8 marks under

Section 3.2. During the course of the argument however, the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner submitted that the Petitioner will confine himself to the

following awards, which, on the basis of two marks per award, would give the

Petitioner an aggregate of 4 marks for Section 3.2:

1. Presidential Research Award 2000 (document marked P12a).

29

2. Award by University of Colombo in recognition of Excellence in Research

2000-2001 (document marked P12b).

The Presidential Research Award has been conferred on the Petitioner in

recognition of his share in the authorship of an article that appeared in the

Journal of Graph Theory 2000. P12a goes onto state that, you have

effectively accomplished your research and submitted it to the judgment of

scientific journals, winning recognition from anonymous referees in open

competition at an international level. You may thus be rightfully proud of

contributing to the reputation of Science and human knowledge.

P12b does not specify the basis of the award.

By a letter dated 8th March 2018 marked R10, the Petitioner requested the

2nd Respondent for information, specifically the marks allocated to me under

the different headings by the above four member Committee that met on 27th

September 2017 and the basis for such allocation of points. The reference

here is to the Senate Appointed Panel.

Attached to the response of the 1st Respondent marked P15 dated 14th May

2018, was the available information, namely two sheets of A4 size paper. The

first contains the sub components of Sections 1, 3.2 and 3.3 with the marks

given for each sub component, signed by the four members of the Panel. No

reasons have been given for the allocation or non-allocation of the marks set

out therein. The second sheet of paper, once again signed by the four

members, contains a summary of the marks given for each of the said sections,

with the observation that the candidate presented the topic well. He has good

teaching skills. Presentation is satisfactory. This too does not contain any

30

reasons for the marks that have been allotted. Thus, it is clear that the two

sheets of paper of the Senate Appointed Panel does not contain reasons as to

why the marks claimed by the Petitioner in his self-assessed application has

not been allotted for Sections 1, 3.2 and 3.3.

Circular P3 specifically requires the Senate Appointed Panel while allocating

marks should submit a report to the Selection Committee regarding the

applicants teaching ability, service to the University, profession, industry,

national development, community etc. This Court is of the view that the said

requirement in P3 of a report cannot surely be fulfilled by merely one

sentence.

According to the documents annexed to P15 the Petitioner had only been

allotted 2 marks for Section 3.2, even though the Petitioner had claimed 8

marks. The said documents do not contain any reasons or an explanation of

the basis on which the Senate Appointed Panel allotted 2 marks for Section

3.2, nor have the Respondents pleaded if the two marks were allotted for

P12a or P12b, or whether the marks are for both P12a and P12b.

The learned Senior State Counsel in her oral submissions submitted that the

Presidential Award and the University award are for one and the same article.

This Court is willing to accept the said explanation, provided this position is

correct. The difficulty that this Court has with this submission is that it is not

supported by the Statement of Objections of the Respondents or by the

Reports of the Senate Appointed Panel. Furthermore, the Petitioner has

denied this position and submitted that in the same year (2000), the Petitioner

also published three other papers in peer reviewed foreign journals, and that

31

the award for Excellence in Research (P12b) was conferred based on the above

four research papers written in 2000-2001. This explanation appears to be

correct, and is reflected by the fact that the Petitioner was allotted marks by

the Experts Panel under Section 2.1.1. (Peer reviewed publications in refereed

Journals) for the following papers published in 2000:21

a) The Ramsey Numbers for a Quadrilateral versus All Graphs on Six vertices

Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing;

b) Ramsey Number r(C5 G) for all graphs G of Order Six, ARS Combinatorica;

c) On a conjecture involving cycle-complete Graph Ramsey Numbers the

Australasian Journal of Combinatorics.

Thus, it is the view of this Court that the Senate Appointed Panel has breached

its duty by failing to record the basis on which it has allotted and/or not

allotted marks to the Petitioner.

Marks allotted by the Experts Panel

The second complaint of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is with regard

to Section 3.1.1, which is marked by the Experts Panel. Section 3.1.1 reads as

follows:

3.1 Dissemination of knowledge

3.1.1 Textbooks for University Students published in the relevant field

maximum of 18 marks

(a) Recognised Publisher upto 6 points/book

21 Vide document marked R15.

32

(b) Other Publisher upto 3 points per book.

The Petitioner states that he has authored a text book on Combinatorics for

the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Open University,

to be used by undergraduates of the Open University. The said book has been

published by the Open University, and has been assigned a ISBN number. The

Petitioner claims that he should be allotted 6 points for this book. Even though

the specific complaint of the Petitioner on this issue is found in paragraphs

16(c) and 22 of the petition, the Statement of Objections does not contain any

explanation as to why the members of the Expert Panel had only allotted an

average of 2.75 marks for the said book.

As observed earlier, after the conclusion of the oral submissions, the

Respondents, by way of a motion dated 12th December 2019, had submitted to

this Court the marks sheet of the two Experts, marked R14 and R15.

Although due to objections raised by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

this Court has made an order rejecting the said documents, this Court would

nonetheless proceed to consider the said documents, as this Court must satisfy

itself if the decision of the Respondents in this regard is fair and reasonable.

This Court has examined the marks sheet of the First Expert, marked R14,

and observes that comments have been provided only for the marks allotted

under Section 2.1.1. In Section 3.1 of his report R14, the First Expert has

allotted 3 out of 6 marks for the textbook under consideration, although the

Petitioner had sought 6 marks in his self-assessed application. No justification

has been given for allotting only 3 out of 6 marks, except that the book has

been referred to as a study guide. No further explanations have been given. In

33

his report R15, the Second Expert has not offered any explanation as to why

he is only allotting 2.5 marks out of a maximum 6, nor does R15 contain any

reservations. Thus, no explanation has been offered, either in R14 or in R15

as to why the Petitioner is not entitled to receive the maximum mark of 6 for

the said book.

This brings this Court to the Third Expert Reviewer. According to his report

marked R6, Professor Jayantha had assigned the Petitioner 54.3 marks for

Section 2 and 3 marks for Section 3.1. This Court has examined R6 and

observes the following findings for allocating only 3 marks for the book titled

Combinatorics.

Evaluator finds that this textbook has content from a textbook written for

A/L combined mathematics students by the applicant according to the

information given in the Bibliography on page 170. Therefore 50% of

marks given.

The Respondents have not provided this Court with any material to

substantiate the above statement of the Third Expert Reviewer. It is the view

of this Court that the Respondents ought to have at least filed an affidavit of

Professor Jayantha, explaining the basis for the above statement, in view of

this issue having been raised specifically in the petition.

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Experts Panel

have failed to justify their review of the Petitioners application with reasons.

34

The duty to give reasons - The second tier

The second tier at which reasons must be given is when the 1st Respondent

conveys the decision of the Selection Committee to the applicant.

The 2nd Respondent, by letter dated 3rd September 2018 marked P17 has

informed the Petitioner that you have not obtained the minimum required

marks for Section 3.0 of your application. Therefore the Council decided not to

promote you to the post of Associate Professor / Professor. While this

reasoning barely meets the threshold of adequacy, this Court would advocate

providing the applicant with a detailed analysis of the marks obtained, at the

time the decision is conveyed. Quite apart from the administrative fairness

that would be achieved by doing so, such a course of action is warranted inter

alia for the reason that an applicant is prevented from re-applying for a period

of two years from the date of his previous application.

Be that as it may, it is the view of this Court that the 1st Respondent ought to

have provided the Petitioner with a detailed analysis of the marks allotted to

him, when the Petitioner requested such information by his letter marked

R10.

The duty to give reasons - The third tier

This Court shall now consider the third tier, which is the duty to give reasons to

this Court, when a decision is challenged. The expanding grounds of judicial

review, particularly in the areas of irrationality and unreasonableness,

illustrates the active role played by Courts in demanding accountability by

35

public authorities for their decisions and thereby ensuring better quality of

decisions by public authorities. It is the view of this Court that providing

reasons for decisions which adversely affect rights of individuals, would allow

Courts to effectively scrutinize the decisions and detect what factors have

influenced the decision maker. That would in turn better equip Courts to fulfill

its function as auditors of legality.

It is the view of this Court that the requirement of reasons in an application for

judicial review is heightened once the petitioner has satisfied Court of the

existence of a prima facie case and notice has been served on the respondent.

As observed by Lord Donaldson MR in R v. Lancashire County Council, ex parte

Huddleston22:

..when the applicant can satisfy a judge of the public law court that the

facts disclosed by her are sufficient to entitle her to apply for judicial

review of the decision..then it becomes the duty of the respondent to

make full and fair disclosure.

In R v. Civil Service Appeal Board, ex parte Cunningham23 Lord Donaldson MR,

developed this idea further, when he held that:

once the public law court has concluded that there is an arguable case

that the decision is unlawful, the position is transformed. The applicant

maynot be entitled to reasons, but the court is.

22[1986] 2 All ER 941. 23[1991] 4 All ER 310 at 316.

36

Similar sentiments have been expressed by our Courts. In Wijepala v

Jayawardene24 Mark Fernando, J considered the necessity to give reasons, at

least to this Court, and held as follows:

Although openness in administration makes it desirable that reasons be

given for decisions of this kind, in this case I do not have to decide whether

the failure to do so vitiated the decision. However, when this Court is

requested to review such a decision, if the petitioner succeeds in making

out a prima facie case, then the failure to give reasons becomes crucial. If

reasons are not disclosed, the inference may have to be drawn that this is

because in fact there were no reasons -and so also, if reasons are

suggested, they were in fact not the reasons, which actually influenced the

decision in the first place.

The same view was taken by the Supreme Court in Karunadasa vs Unique Gem

Stones Limited and Others25 where Mark Fernando, J held as follows:

To say that Natural Justice entitles a party to a hearing does not mean

merely that his evidence and submissions must be heard and recorded; it

necessarily means that he is entitled to a reasoned consideration of the

case which he presents. And whether or not the parties are also entitled to

be told the reasons for the decision, if they are withheld, once judicial

review commences, the decision "may be condemned as arbitrary and

unreasonable"; certainly, the Court cannot be asked to presume that they

were valid reasons, for that would be to surrender its discretion. The 2nd

24 SC (FR) (Application) No. 89/95 S.C. Minutes of 30.06.1995; referred to in Deepthi Kumara Gunaratne and others vs Dayananda Dissanayake, Commissioner of Elections and another; SC (FR) 56/2008; SC Minutes of 19th March 2009. 25 [1997] (1) Sri L.R. 256, at page 263.

37

respondent's failure to produce the 3rd respondent's recommendation thus

justified the conclusion that there were no valid reasons, and that Natural

Justice had not been observed.

This Court therefore wishes to reiterate that once notices have been issued on

the Respondents after Court being satisfied of the existence of a prima facie

case against the Respondents, the Respondents are under a duty to give

reasons for the decisions that are impugned. In paragraphs 16(c) and 21 of the

petition, the Petitioner has specifically stated that he is entitled to two marks

each, for each of the said awards marked P12a and P12b. Failure by the

Respondents to answer this specific allegation has prompted the Petitioner to

reiterate his complaint in his counter affidavit.26 Similarly, the Petitioner has

complained in paragraph 16(c) and 22 about the non allotment of marks for

the book but the Respondents have remained silent in their Statement of

Objections.

This Court is of the view that in this application, the 1st Respondent was under

a duty to explain to this Court the reason for the non-allocation of marks for

the University award, and the allocation of only 50% of the marks for the book.

The Respondents have failed to answer the specific averments in the petition

with regard to the University award. The same would apply to the textbook,

except that the report of Professor Jayantha, even though filed belatedly, gives

some sort of an explanation. Filing of this report however is inadequate for the

reason that this Court has still not been told why the other External Expert

allotted 3 marks and 2.5 marks, respectively, for the said text book.

26 Vide paragraph 8(g) Despite the said two different awards received by me, namely one by the President of the Republic and the other by the Vice Chancellor, the 1st to 29th Respondents have failed in their Statement of Objections to provide an explanation as to why I have only been given 2 marks for the said awards.

38

Therefore, the only conclusion that this Court can arrive at is that the

Respondents have failed at the third tier, by failing to disclose to this Court in

their Statement of Objections, the reasons not to allot marks claimed by the

Petitioner.

Nexus between the duty to give reasons and irrationality

Where the reasons for a decision are not provided to a party against whom a

decision is made, that party may seek judicial review of such decision on the

basis that the decision is irrational or unreasonable. As noted above, where the

Court is satisfied that a prima facie case has been made on the inference that

the decision is irrational or unreasonable in the absence of reasons, the

respondents have a burden to satisfy Court why such inference is not justified.

The absence of reasons would support an argument that the decision maker

has not afforded a fair hearing, which requires all relevant material to be taken

into consideration prior to arriving at a decision. In De Smiths Judicial

Review27 it is observed that Irrationality may also sometimes be inferred from

the absence of reasons.28 When reasons are required, either by statute or by

the growing common law requirements, or where they are provided, even

though not strictly required, those reasons must be both adequate and

intelligible. They must therefore both rationally relate to the evidence in the

case29, and be comprehensible in themselves.

27Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review [8th Edition, 2018] Sweet and Maxwell, page 605. 28Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Food [1968] AC 997 at 1032. 29 Re Poyser and Mills Arbitration [1964] 2 QB 467 at 478.

39

In Padfield and Others v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and

Others,30 although Courts did not hold that there was a general duty to give

reasons, it was held that the absence of reasons may result in a finding of

irrationality.

If all the prima facie reasons seem to point in favour of his taking a

certain course to carry out the intentions of Parliament in respect of a

power which it has given him in that regard, and he gives no reason

whatever for taking a contrary course, the Court may infer that he has no

good reason and that he is not using the power given by Parliament to

carry out its intentions.

This Court is however mindful that the inference of irrationality and

unreasonableness in the absence of reasons is not automatic, as emphasised in

the following paragraph by Lord Keith in Regina v. Secretary of State for Trade

and Industry, ex parte Lornho plc:31

The absence of reasons for a decision where there is no duty to give them

cannot itself provide any support for the suggested irrationality of the

decision. The only significance of the absence of reasons is that if all other

known facts and circumstances appear to point overwhelmingly in favour

of a different decision, the decision-maker, who has given no reasons,

cannot complain if the court draws the inference that he had no rational

reason for his decision.

As such, if the respondents cannot, or do not provide reasons even to Court to

justify their decision, Court may, if the circumstances are such that the 30 [1968] AC 997, at page 1053. 31[1989] 1 WLR 525 at 539-540.

40

evidence before Court points to a completely different path to what was taken

by the decision maker, draw an inference that the decision was not taken for a

good reason or that there was no reason for the decision and it is therefore

not rational or reasonable.

Conclusion

The Petitioner is faced with an extremely unfortunate situation. He claims he

should be given two marks for the University Award and an additional three

marks for his book. The Senate Appointed Panel and the Experts Panel have

not given reasons why they withheld the marks claimed by the Petitioner in his

self assessed application. The Selection Committee has seen the injustice that

would be caused to the Petitioner if the decisions of the Experts Panel and the

Senate Appointed Panel were followed but have been wrongfully prevented by

the University Grants Commission from rectifying the mistakes of the Experts

Panel and the Senate Appointed Panel. To make matters worse, the University

Grants Commission claims that the marks allotted by the Senate Appointed

Panel cannot be rectified, which, as this Court has already observed, is contrary

to their own Circular R4. And the final straw is the belated and misconceived

argument of the Respondents that the Petitioner should have acted in terms of

Section 86 of the Universities Act and filed a complaint with the University

Services Appeals Board, when the complaint of the Petitioner does not come

within the provisions of Section 86. Where does this leave the Petitioner, and

what is his remedy?

It is the view of this Court that the remedy lies with the Selection Committee,

who must discharge the obligation conferred on them by the Circulars P3 and

R4. Accordingly, it is the view of this Court that the final decision should be

41

reached by the Selection Committee following the guidelines in the marking

scheme.32

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the decision of the

Senate Appointed Panel not to allot two marks for the University Award and

the decision of the Experts Panel not to allot six marks for the book published

by the Petitioner, are unreasonable, and that the said decision is liable to be

quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

This Court is also of the view that the Selection Committee must consider, in

the light of the marking scheme contained in P3:

(a) The decision of the Experts Panel and the decision and reasons assigned

by the Third Expert Reviewer for the allocation of only three marks for the

book on Combinatorics, and arrive at a suitable decision.

(b) The decision of the Senate Appointed Panel not to allot two marks for the

University Award P12b, and arrive at a suitable decision.

This Court accordingly issues a Writ of Certiorari quashing P17 and P18, and

a Writ of Mandamus on the 1st Respondent to direct the Selection Committee

to consider the application of the Petitioner in terms of Circular No. 916

marked P3. This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
