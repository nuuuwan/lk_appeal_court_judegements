Janak De Silva J.

This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kuliyapitiya dated

01.07.1994.

The plaintiff instituted the above styled action in the District Court of Kuliyapitiya by filing the

amended plaint dated 19.03.1981 [page 117 of the Appeal Brief] claiming inter alia a right of way

from the main road to an allotment of land belonging to him over two allotment of lands

belonging to the defendants.

The plaintiff averred in his plaint that-

1. He became the owner of the allotment of land more fully described in the schedule '25)' to

the said amended plaint by virtue of the final decree of District Court of Ku liyapitiya case

bearing no. 2985/P;

2. There has been a cart road (10 feet wide) to the said allotment of land over two allotment

of lands belonging to the defendants more fully described in the schedules ' (J)' and 'd' to

the said amended plaint for over a period of 35 - 40 years;

3. He is entitled to the said right of way by prescription and by way of necessity;

4. The 2nd and 7th - 9th defendants are obstructing the said cart road unlawfully and causing

damages amounting to Rs. 100/- per month .

Page 2 of 9

, .

A commission was issued to identify the right of way claimed by the plaintiff, Accordingly, plan

no. 233/84 dated 08.10.1984 made by S. B. Abeykone, Licensed Surveyor [page 260 ofthe Appeal

Brief] and the surveyor's report [page 256 of the Appeal Brief] were produced and the cart road

(10 feet wide) claimed by the plaintiff is depicted as Lots 1, 2 and 3 in the said plan no. 233/84.

Alternatively, a proposed road convenient to all the parties to the action was shown as Lots 4, 5,

6 and 7 in the same plan.

Another commission was issued at the request of the 8th defendant and plan no. 932/l:\l~ dated

27.01.1986 made by A. B. M. Weber, Licensed Surveyor was prepared which depicted (as Lots 1

and 2) an existing road that leads to the allotment of land belonging to the plaintiff.

The 7th - 9th defendants filed their answer on 16.02.1987 [page 137 of the Appeal Brief] and

stated:

1. The plaintiff had ample opportunity to obtain a right of way by the final decree of District

Court of Kuliyapitiya case bearing no. 2985/P;

2. However, without doing so, he reserved his right to obtain a right of way if the necessity

ever arises;

3. It is evident by the said conduct of the plaintiff that he already had an alternative road

leading to his allotment of land;

4. The said alternative road is depicted in plan no. 932/l:\l~ dated 27.01.1986 made by A. B.

M. Weber, Licensed Surveyor.

5. The right of way sought by the plaintiff runs through two allotments of land belong to the

defendants splitting the said two allotments of land into several allotments of land;

6. If the right of way sought by the original plaintiff is given to him, the defendants will not

be able to possess the said two allotments of land belonging to them peacefully or without

any disturbance.

After trial, the learned District Judge held that the plaintiff is entitled to the right of way claimed

by him over the two allotments of land belonging to the defendants.

The contention of the plaintiff is that he has been using the claimed right of way as a cart road

for over a period of 35 - 40 years and hence he has acquired the prescriptive title to the said cart

road [pages 183, 191-193 and 195 of the Appeal Brief] . The defendants did not dispute the fact

that the plaintiff used the said cart road which runs through their allotments of land. Their

position is that the plaintiff used the said cart road with their express consent [pages 168, 171,

200 - 202, 213 - 216 and 221 of the Appeal Brief]. No evidence was led to show that there was a

dispute over the said cart road prior to the alleged obstruction by the defendants.

.

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance reads-

"Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a defendant in any action, ar

by those under whom he claims, of londs or immovable property, by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession

unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of service or duty, or by

any other act by the possessor, from which an acknowledgment of a right existing in

another person wauld fairly and naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the

bringing of such action, shall entitle the defendant to a decree in his favour with costs. And

in like manner, when any plaintiff shall bring his action, or any third party shall intervene

in any action for the purpose of being quieted in his possession of lands or other immovable

property, or to prevent encroachment or usurpation thereof, or to establish his claim in

any other manner to such land or other property, proof of such undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession as herein before explained, by such plaintiff or intervenient, or

by those under whom he claims, shall entitle such plaintiff or intervenient to a decree in

his favour with costs." [Emphasis addedJ

It is trite law that in order to acquire prescriptive title to an immovable property, there should be

an exclusive and adverse possession against all the other persons/owners.

A plaintiff who claims a right of way by prescription must establish the requisites stipulated in

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance. This means that, as set out in section 3, the plaintiff had

to prove that he has had undisturbed and uninterrupted possession and use of the right of way

for a minimum of ten years and that such possession and user of the right of way has been

adverse to or independent of the owner of the land and without acknowledging any right of the

owner of the land over the use of that right of way [Maddumage Sulochana Priyangika Perera v.

Maddumage Nimal Gunasiri Perera and Others (S. c. Appeal No. 59/2010 S. C. M. 18.01.2019)].

In Ranasinghe v. Somawathie and Others [(2004) 2 Sri. L. R. 154 at 158J Dissanayake, J. observed:

"A right of way by prescription has to be established by proof of the existence of the

following necessary ingredients inter alia that are necessary to conclude the existence of

such a right-

a) adverse possession; and

b) uninterrupted and independent user for at least 10 years to the exclusion of all

others.

The above matters are all questions of fact and they have to establish by cogent evidence."

Page 4 of 9

, '

The defendants took up the position that they allowed the plaintiff to use the said cart road at

his request until the determination of District Court of Kuliyapitiya case bearing no, 2985/P,

Without disputing the position taken up by the defendants, the plaintiff led evidence to show

that he has been using the said cart road peacefully for over a period of 35 - 40 years, There is

no evidence to show that the plaintiff commenced to use the said cart road adversely to the

defendants,

When a user of immovable property commences with leave and license, the presumption is that

its continuance rests on the permission originally granted, Clear and unmistakable evidence of

the commencement of an adverse user thereafter for the prescriptive period is necessary to

entitle the licensee to claim a servitude in respect of the premises [De Soysa v, Fanseka (58 N.L.R,

501)J,

In view of the above, I hold that the plaintiff has failed to establish that he is entitled to the said

right of way by prescription,

The question to be considered then is whether the plaintiff has established his claim for a right

of way of necessity.

In the case of Maddumage Sulochana Priyangika Perera v. Maddumage Nimal Gunasiri Perera

and Others (supra), Prasanna Jayawardena, p, c., J. observed -

"However, with regard ta a claim of a right of way af necessity, the claimant is nat required

ta prave possession or user af the right of way. Instead, a claimant wha seeks a declaration

fram court that he is entitled ta a right of way of necessity over the land of another, must

satisfy the court that the situation of the claimant's land is such that, the only raute which

can be used from the claimant's land [withaut having to undergo unreasonable

inconvenience or difficulty] to access a public road or other roadway fram which a public

road can be accessed, is by traversing aver the land of another person and that, therefore,

by reason of necessity, he is entitled to a declaration from court that he is entitled to a

right of way of necessity over that person's land to access the public road ar roadway,

subject, usually, to the payment of appropriate compensation to the owner of the servient

land. "

Page 5 of 9

However, if there is an alternative route available, the claimant, usually, will not be entitled to a

right of way of necessity over the land of another unless the court is satisfied that the alternative

route is so inconvenient or difficult to use that it is unreasonable to expect the claimant to use

that alternative route. Where the plaintiff has an alternative route, the fact that this alternative

route is longer or inconvenient or even arduous will not entitle the plaintiff to obtain a shorter

and more convenient right of way over the land of another unless, as mentioned earlier, the court

is satisfied that, the alternative route is unreasonably inconvenient or difficult to use [Mohotti

Appu v. Wijewordene (60 N.l.R. 46), Chondrosiri v. Wickremosinghe (70 N.l.R. 15), Somorotne v.

Munosinghe (74 N.l.R. 14)].

To establish that the plaintiff has an alternative road to his allotment of land, the defendants have

produced the plan no. 932/~~ dated 27.01.1986 made by A. B. M. Weber, Licensed Surveyor

[page 255 of the Appeal Brief] in which the said alternative road is depicted as Lots 1 and 2.

In the surveyor's report, the licensed surveyor who prepared the said plan no. 932/~~ has

described the said Lot 2 as follows [page 252 ofthe Appeal Brief] -

The evidence led by both parties reveal that the plaintiff used to use carts to transport his

merchandises and his son uses a car [pages 158, 164, 167, 184, 200 - 202 and 208 of the Appeal

Brief]. Even if there is an alternative road leading to the allotment of land belonging to the

plaintiff, it is quite clear that the said alternative road provides no means of accessing the

allotment of land belonging to the plaintiff by a vehicle.

A right of way must not be understood solely based upon the times during which Roman Law and

the Roman-Dutch Law was developed. In the contemporary context, I am of the view that it is

unreasonable to expect the plaintiff not to use a vehicle for transportation purposes and the

extent of any right of way by necessity must be considered by Court having due regard to the

modern requirements of any person. Thus, I hold that the plaintiff is entitled to a right of way of

necessity over the allotment of lands belonging to the defendants so as to enable him to use a

vehicle.

It is trite law that when granting a right of way of necessity, the court would grant a necessary

road to reach the main road by the shortest way and with the least damage and that to the

smallest possible detriment to the owner allowing it [De Voos v. M endis (49 N.l.R. 525), Rosolin

Fernondo v. Alwis ond Others (61 N.l.R. 302)].

Page 6 of9

In Amolis Appu v. Heenhomy (40 (L.W. 90 at 92) Gratiaen J. held:

"The underlying principle seems to be that laid down in the opinion of Grotius which is

followed in De Vaas vs. Mendis (1948) 49 N.L.R. 525, namely that where a party proves

that he has "no reasonably sufficient access to th e public road" the Court will grant him

"a necessary road whereby to reach the high road by the shortest way and with the least

damage". If this test be applied in the present case, I think that the plaintiff's claim is

entitled to succeed. Th e servitude asked for is "by the shortest way" and it has been

proved that the defendant would suffer no material damage or inconvenience by the

proposed widening of the dewata but would rather derive financial benefit from an award

of compensation in her favour. The term "reasonably sufficient access" is at best a

comparative term, and in deciding a case which falls somewhere near the indefinable

border-line between "necessity" and obvious "convenience", it is relevant to consider,

among other factors, to what extent the defendant would suffer by a grant of the

servitude asked for".

The right of way claimed by the plaintiff (i.e. Lots 1, 2 and 3 in the said plan no. 233/84) runs

through the two allotments of land belonging to the defendant splitting it to several allotments.

Also, it can be observed that the dwelling houses of the defendants are situ ated very closely to

the claimed right of way. Therefore, in my view the learned District Judge erred in granting the

right of way set out in the judgment.

Therefore, I am inclined to grant the plaintiff the proposed right of way depicted as Lots 4, 5, 6

and 7 in the said plan no. 233/84 and it seems to be a more convenient option for all the parties

and the defendants. It must also be noted that the plaintiff has indicated his willingness to accept

the same [paragraph 9 ofthe surveyor's report at page 257 ofthe Appeal Brief] . Also, the plaintiff

has accepted that the proposed right of way gives access to his allotment of land [page 180 of the

appeal brief]. It is also the observation of S. B. Abeykone, Licensed Surveyor who prepared the

plan no. 233/84 dated 08.10.1984 that this is the more suitable right of way.

In granting this right of way of necessity, the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th defendants must be compensated

by the award of compensation as required by law.

If the neighbour is ordered to submit his property to a full and permanent right of way which is

sought ex necessitate, the owner of the landlocked property must pay a just price for this right.

[Hall and Kellaway, Servitudes, 2nd Ed., p. 69]

Page 7 of9

The total extent of this right of way of necessity is 9.9 perches. I assess a perch of this land at Rs.

2,00,000/= per perch. Accordingly, the Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent will pay the following

amounts to the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th defendants:

3rd defendant -Rs. 2,00,000/=

4 th defendant -

5th defendant -

6th defendant -

Rs. 3,75,000/=

Rs. 3,50,000/=

Rs. 11,00,000/=

For all the foregoing reasons, I vary the judgment of the learned District Judge of Kuliyapitiya

dated 01.07.1994. I allow the appeal to that extent and answer the issues as follows-
