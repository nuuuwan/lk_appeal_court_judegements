Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

As seen from inter alia P24-P27, in the midst of the process to

alienate a stretch of State land of about forty acres in extent in

the divisional secretariat area of Wanathavilluwa on a long-term

lease to the Petitioner for a wildlife conservation and

reforestation project, the Commissioner General of Agrarian

Development sent P32 dated 22.09.2017 to the Petitioner asking

him to cultivate with paddy compulsorily and efficiently an

uncultivated area of paddy land in extent of eight acres within

the aforesaid forty acres of land between 6th-12th October 2017.

If paddy cultivation was not possible, the Petitioner was asked to

cultivate an appropriate crop upon the instructions of the

agrarian officer. The Petitioner was informed that failure to

follow the said directive would result in the paddy land being

handed over to another party for cultivation, without prior notice

to the Petitioner. This directive was issued pursuant to a policy

decision of the then Government to cultivate uncultivated paddy

fields in the country.

4

The Petitioner has filed this application to quash P32 by a writ of

certiorari.

The Petitioners position is that the land in question is not a

paddy land within the definition given in section 101 of the

Agrarian Development Act. I accept the submission of the

Petitioner that if the land is not a paddy land, the decision

contained in P32 is ultra vires.

The said section defines paddy land as follows:

paddy land means land which is cultivated with paddy or

is prepared for the cultivation of paddy or which, having at

any time previously been cultivated with paddy, is suitable

for the cultivation of paddy, and includes such other land

adjoining or appertaining to it as may be used by the

cultivator for a threshing floor or for constructing his

dwelling house, but does not include chena land or any

land, which, with the permission of the Commissioner-

General is used for any purpose other than cultivation in

accordance with the provisions of this Act, or which is

determined by the Commissioner-General not to be paddy

land.

In short, paddy land means land which (a) is cultivated with

paddy or (b) is prepared for the cultivation of paddy or (c) having

at any time previously been cultivated with paddy, is suitable for

the cultivation of paddy.

There is no dispute that this land is neither cultivated with

paddy nor prepared for the cultivation of paddy. There cannot

5

be any dispute that this land had previously been cultivated

with paddy (vide inter alia paragraph 7 of P44 tendered by the

Petitioner). It is clear the land has not been cultivated with

paddy for a long time, possibly about 30 years. Then the only

outstanding question is whether the land is suitable for the

cultivation of paddy at present.

By producing several documents, including P31, P33 and P37,

the Petitioner submits that this land is not suitable for paddy

cultivation due to the salinity in the soil and water of the area.

The Petitioner also says the land is located near the Wilpattu

National Park and, if cultivated, this area would be prone to

incidents of the human elephant conflict, which is non-existent

at present. He says this land can be used instead for an inland

fishery.

However, none of these factors had been taken into

consideration by the Commissioner when P32 was sent or at any

time thereafter. As I said before, P32, which is a common letter

sent to, supposedly, paddy land-owners, was issued upon a

policy decision taken by the then Government to cultivate

uncultivated paddy lands. It is not clear whether the said policy

decision has been abandoned with the change of Government.

It appears that although the time period given in P32 to cultivate

the land had long since lapsed by the time this application was

filed, up to now no steps have been taken by the Commissioner

to hand over the land to a third party for paddy or any other

cultivation, although the Petitioner says steps are afoot to hand

over the land to the 4th Respondent.

6

In the facts and circumstances of this case, it is not clear

whether the disputed portion of land falls within the definition of

paddy land in terms of the Agrarian Development Act for the

Commissioner to have sent P32 to the Petitioner. I am unable to

accept the argument of learned State Counsel, without

qualification, that the said land is in fact an abandoned paddy

field which falls within the definition of a paddy land as defined

by the Agrarian Development Act of 2000. The land being an

abandoned paddy field is not in itself sufficient for it to come

under the definition of paddy land. Land used for paddy

cultivation many moons ago, but which has undergone

significant changes with the passage of time, cannot continue to

be considered paddy land forever. The land shall be suitable for

cultivation of paddy at present. Salinity in soil/water and the

potential threat of the human elephant conflict are relevant

factors the Commissioner ought to have taken into account in

deciding whether the land is suitable for cultivation of paddy at

present.

Taking all these matters into consideration, I quash P32 by

certiorari.

This does not prevent the Commissioner General of Agrarian

Services from reconsidering the matter and making a fresh

decision with reasons.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed. No costs.
