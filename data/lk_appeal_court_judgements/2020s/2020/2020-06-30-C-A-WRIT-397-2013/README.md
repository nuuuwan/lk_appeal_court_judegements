Janak De Silva, J.

The Petitioner is the owner of land and premises bearing No.9, Asoka Gardens, Bambalapitiya.

At the time of the purchase of this land and premises by the Petitioner in 2006, there was a

neglected building standing on the premises. The attempts by the Petitioner to repair and

renovate it resulted in its collapse.

Therefore, the Petitioner sought to construct a new building and took steps to have the building

plan approved by the Colombo Municipal Council (CMe).

Premises bearing Nos. 10 and 12 on Kotelawala Avenue are situated along the southern boundary

of the Petitioner's land. The drainage lines of premises bearing Nos. 10 and 12, Kotelawala

Avenue run under and through the land owned by the Petitioner and discharges into the public

drainage line running below Asoka Gardens.

The Petitioner in this application seeks a writ of mandamus against the 1st and 2nd Respondents

directing them to exercise the statutory powers vested in the CMC and Respondents by section

110(6) and section 117 and other provisions contained in Part VI of the Municipal Councils

Ordinance and to disconnect the premises Nos. 10 and 12, Kotelawala Avenue from the existing

drainage line and to connect the said premises Nos. 10 and 12 directly to the public drainage line

under the Kotelawala Avenue.

Parties have made extensive submission on the interpretation that should be adopted by this

Court to sections 110(6), 117 and other provisions contained in Part VI of the Municipal Councils

Ordinance.

However, such an exercise is not required to dispose of this matter as the prayer to the petition

is very specific requiring the premises bearing Nos. 10 and 12, Kotelawala Avenue to be connected

directly to the public drainage line under Kotalawala Avenue. Hence for a writ of mandamus to

issue it must be established that there is a public drainage line under Kotalawala Avenue.

In order to establish this position, the Petitioner places much reliance on plan marked 'F2'

showing that there is such a public drainage. It is certified by the 2nd Respondent who has

however filed an affidavit dated 06th February 2014 wherein he states, at paragraph 13(1), that

the plan marked 'F2' had been generated on inaccurate information that had been entered in to

the system by the operator, which the CMC subsequently learnt and corrected. He goes on to

state, at paragraphs 13(ii) and (iii), that therefore the plan marked 'F2' is a plan that contains

inaccurate data and that the drainage line shown in the plan appended to the petition marked

'F2' and 'F3' does not physically exist under Kotelawala Avenue.

There is no reason to doubt the position taken by the 2nd Respondent or that he is biased. He in

fact summoned the parties for a discussion after the Petitioner sought his assistance to separate

the drainage lines (C and Cl). The Petitioner does not make any allegation of bias or mala fides

against the 2nd Respondent.

The CMC is entitled to correct factually inaccurate information given by it and act on the correct

facts. In fact, the CMC was duty bound to reconsider the plan 'F2' once it became aware that it

contained inaccurate facts and there cannot be any estoppel or legitimate expectation arising

from a mistake of fact [Rootkin v. Kent County Council (1981) 1 W.L.R. 1186].

In the aforesaid circumstances, the evidence before this Court is that physically there is no

drainage lines under Kotelawala Avenue. Hence, irrespective of the applicable provision, the relief

claimed by the Petitioner cannot be granted.

For the foregoing reasons, this application is dismissed without costs.
