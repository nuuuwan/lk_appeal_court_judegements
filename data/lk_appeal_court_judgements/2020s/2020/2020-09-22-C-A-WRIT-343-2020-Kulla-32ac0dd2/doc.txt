These applications are made in respect of two Directors namely, Kulappuarachchige Don

Anuradha Perera and Kulappuarachchige Don Harindra Perera of a company called

Bally's limited. Both these two Directors are being summoned to appear before the

learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo subsequent to the issuance of summons in

Magistrate's Court Case bearing Nos. 40506/8/20 and 40508/8/20.

A cogent submission is made by the learned President's Counsel Mr. Rienzie

Arsecularatne that wrong persons have been summoned before Court when in fact it is

the company, Bally's limited which is liable to be summoned as a defaulter in terms of

Section 8(1) of the Finance Act No. 10 of 2015. The argument is made that in terms of this

Finance Act No. 10 of 2015, it is the company called Bally's limited that becomes liable

and not the two Directors who have been summoned by way of these sununons. In a

series of judgments such as MED. Silva 11. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 53 NLR

page 280, RanjHh Wijemanne v. Commissioner of Income Tax (1951) Vol. I Ceylon

Tax Cases 496, Rajan Philip v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1982) Vol. IV

2

Lanka Tax Cases 301 and Dias v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (2011) 2

SLR I5.It has been authoritatively held the person summoned should be the defaulter.

In these cases, Mr. Arsecularatne, learned President's Counsel who appears for the

Petitioners strongly argues that these two Petitioners do not become liable for the tax in

dispute. Having listened to this argument we advert our attention to the case of

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue v. Koggala Garments limited (Court of

Appeal minutes of 05.04.2017) - in case bearing No. CA Application TaxlOl/2008, where

two Judges of this Court conclusively decided that any objection to jurisdiction must be

taken before the tribunal which is seized of the matter in the first instance. This Court

cited Wade and Forsyth Administrative Law 11th Edition 2014 where it is stated as

follows.

"Where a jurisdictional question is disputed before a tribunal, the tribunal must necessarily decide

it. If it refuses to do so, it is wrongfully declining jurisdiction and the Court will order it to act

properly."

In the circumstances, we direct that this jurisdictional bar must be first taken before the

learned Magistrate before whom this matter is due to come up for a cause to be shown

on 21.09.2020. It is proper that the learned Magistrate should address this question of

jurisdiction in the first instance and make his order thereon. Therefore, until the

Magistrate makes his order on the jurisdiction, we would decline jurisdiction and in

view of this order, the Petitioners state that they would be withdrawing these

applications, but with the reservation that they would have recourse to this Court on the

jurisdictional question once the learned Magistrate has made its ruling.

This order will also apply to the submissions that have been made by Mr. Riad Ameen,

learned Counsel for the Petitioners in Case Nos. CA Writ 344/2020 and CA Writ

345/2020 where the Petitioner is Sam an Pradeep Nishantha Kodituwakku, who is also

summoned to answer a show cause in two cases bearing Nos.40507/8/20 and 40509/8/20.

All these jurisdictional questions focus on the same issue namely, Directors are not liable

3

for the tax in dispute of a company for which only the company is liable to show cause as

a defaulter.

Section 7 (1) of the said Act states that any person who fails to pay the levy as provided

for in Section 6, shall be deemed to be a defaulter under this Act.

Section 8 (1) of the Act enables the Commissioner General to issue a certificate stating

the amount in default to the Magistrate having jurisdiction, whereupon the Magistrate

shall summon the defaulter to show cause.

I am of the view that any person summoned as a defaulter to show cause is entitled to

raise before the Magistrate that the Court does not have jurisdiction over him as he is not

the defaulter within the four corners of the Finance Act, No 10 of 2015.

As we have pinpointed, the want of jurisdiction has to be raised before the learned

Magistrate and any order made by the Magistrate is susceptible to challenge in proper

proceedings.

I agree.
