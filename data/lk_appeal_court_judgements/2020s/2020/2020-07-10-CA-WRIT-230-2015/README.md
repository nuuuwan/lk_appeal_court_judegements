Argued on: 19.06.2020

Decided on: 10.07.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Admittedly, the Petitioner Company obtained banking facilities

from the 1st Respondent Bank and defaulted. The Petitioner

3

says the default is due to reasons beyond its control. After a

spate of correspondence spanning many years, the Bank has, in

terms of section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) Act, No. 4 of 1990, as amended, passed a Board

resolution dated 27.04.2015 marked R13 to recover the dues of

the Petitioner Company by parate execution.

The Petitioner says the Bank refused to reschedule the loan, as

recommended by the Central Bank by letter dated 19.05.2015.

In fact, the said letter marked R15(A) tendered with the

Respondents statement of objections, merely requests the

Respondent Bank to look into the matter and respond to the

Petitioner within 14 days.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking a writ of mandamus

compelling the Bank to reschedule the loan, and a writ of

certiorari quashing the aforesaid Board resolution as it is

arbitrary and grossly unreasonable.

This Court cannot quash the said Board resolution on the

grounds of arbitrariness and unreasonableness because the

resolution is not arbitrary and unreasonable. The Bank is

statutorily entitled to pass such resolutions to recover its dues.

Nor can this Court force the Bank to reschedule the Petitioners

loan. There is no obligation, statutory or otherwise, on the part

of the Bank to reschedule the loan.

The Petitioner in paragraph 20 of the amended petition says the

Bank did not serve notice of the resolution on the Petitioner, as

required under section 8 of the Act, and therefore the Banks

action is procedurally ultra vires. The Bank produced

4

documents marked R14G and R14H to prove service of notice on

the Petitioner by registered post. There is no denial of this by

way of counter affidavit.

During the course of the argument, learned Counsel for the

Petitioner raised three new points.

The first one is, the substituted 1st Respondent Bank did not

serve notice of the resolution on the Petitioner. At the time the

Petitioner filed this application, the name of the 1st Respondent

Bank was Lankaputra Development Bank. Whilst the case was

pending, the Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner, with notice to

the Attorney-at-Law for the Lankaputra Development Bank, had

made an application by way of motion dated 26.06.2019 to

substitute Regional Development Bank in place of Lankaputra

Development Bank, as Lankaputra Development Bank has been

taken over by and merged with the Regional Development Bank in

Sri Lanka. The said application was allowed. Having acted to

substitute the Respondent Bank, it cannot lie in the mouth of

the Petitioner now to contest the standing of the substituted

Bank. Moreover, if the Petitioner was serious on this point, the

Petitioner would have raised it as an issue at the time of the

substitution, calling for the substituted Bank to tender proof of

how the said merger or takeover took place. The Petitioner

cannot spring surprise on the Respondents at the argument by

raising mixed questions of fact and law for the first time.

The next point raised is, Lankaputra Development Bank and its

successor Regional Development Bank are Licensed Specialised

Banks and not Licensed Commercial Banks, and therefore these

5

Banks cannot avail themselves of the provisions of the Recovery

of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act to recover their debts

by parate execution. It is the argument of Counsel for the

Petitioner that, in terms of section 22, only Licensed Commercial

Banks can resort to parate execution. This argument is

unsustainable. An amendment to the principal Act by Act No. 1

of 2011 encapsulates Licensed Specialised Bank within the

definition of Bank.

The final submission of Counsel for the Petitioner relates to

inconsistency in the preamble of the Act and the said loan

granted to the Petitioner. The preamble of the Act states it is An

Act to provide for the recovery of loans granted by Banks for the

economic development of Sri Lanka. Counsel argues the loan

given to the Petitioner does not fall within the purpose stated in

the preamble and therefore the Bank cannot recover its dues by

parate execution. This is not the first time this argument has

been presented before this Court. In DFCC Bank Ltd v.

Somaweera [2003] 3 Sri LR 128, this Court rejected the same

argument on two grounds. Firstly, the preamble of an Act

cannot be utilised to restrict a clear provision in the Act.

Secondly, even if what is recoverable under this Act is only loans

for the economic development of Sri Lanka, if there is material to

suggest the loan has contributed to economic development, the

requirement is fulfilled.

In the case of V.T. Ramalingam (Labour Officer) v. S. Sinnadurai

(1965) 67 NLR 45 at 47 it was held:

6

It is a well known canon of construction that if the words of

a statute are clear, a preamble to an Act cannot control its

clear and unambiguous provisions. In The Attorney-

General, v. Prince Ernest Augustus of Hanover (1957) 2

WLR 1 at 9, Viscount Simonds succinctly stated this

proposition as follows: I would suggest that it is better

stated by saying that the context of the preamble is not to

influence the meaning otherwise ascribable to the enacting

part unless there is a compelling reason for it.

I have no reason to deviate from the above dicta.

Before I part with this Judgment let me also add the following.

The Petitioner cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court

as of right. It is a discretionary relief; an act of grace on the part

of the Court. The fact that the loan was obtained and the

Petitioner is in default is undisputed. By this application, filed

more than five years ago, the Petitioner has prevented the Bank

from recovering its dues through parate executiona quicker and

faster procedure recognised by the law. Banks are not

charitable institutions; they are the cornerstones of economies.

It should be understood that similar to the Petitioner being

engaged in a business, granting loans with the expectation of

timely repayment is a major part of the ordinary course of

business of a Bank. If a Bank is prevented from taking such

measures as it is entitled in law to take to protect its interests,

the economy of the country would suffer. The Recovery of Loans

by Banks (Special Provisions) Act was passed to assist Banks to

fast-track the procedure of debt recovery. There is no place for

high-flown technical objections under this Act. As this Court

7

held in Zubair v. Bank of Ceylon [2000] 2 Sri LR 187, In debt

recovery matters it would not be correct for the Court to hold

against the intention of the legislature on technicalities.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with costs.
