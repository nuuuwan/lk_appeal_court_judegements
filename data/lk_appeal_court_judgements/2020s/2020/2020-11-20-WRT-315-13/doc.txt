Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.

Counsel: Ranjan Suwandaratne, P.C., with Anil

Rajakaruna for the Petitioner.

Kushan DAlwis, P.C., with Prasanna de Silva

for the 1st and 5th-20th Respondents.

Roshan Dayaratne with Pubudu Perera for the

4th Respondent.

Argued on: 16.10.2020

Decided on: 16.11.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner made an application to the 1st Respondent

Peoples Bank under part VIII of the Finance Act, No. 11 of 1963,

as amended, pleading acquisition of the subject land by the

Bank, in order to redeem the land alienated by the Petitioner to

the 3rd Respondent on a conditional transfer, which the 3rd

Respondent had thereafter transferred to the 4th Respondent.

Section 71(3) of the Finance Act reads:

The question whether any premises which the Bank is

authorized to acquire under this Part of this Act should or

should not be acquired shall be determined by the Bank

and every such determination of the Bank shall be final

and conclusive and shall not be called in question in any

court.

6

It is common ground that such a determination by the Bank is

subject to judicial review.

Section 71(3A) of the Act reads:

For the purposes of making a determination under

subsection (3), the Bank shall cause an inquiry to be held

into the application by an inquiring officer appointed by the

Bank. The inquiring officer appointed by the Bank shall give

the owner of the premises to which the application relates

and the person making the application an opportunity of

being heard either in person or by an agent authorized in

that behalf, and shall have all the powers of a District Court

(a) to summon and compel the attendance of witnesses; (b)

to compel the production of documents; and (c) to administer

any oath or affirmation to witnesses.

Section 71(3A) alone goes to show the seriousness of the inquiry

and the weight attached to the findings and recommendations of

the inquiring officer, notwithstanding the ultimate decision is

taken by the Board of Directors of the Bank.

The Bank appointed the 2nd Respondent, the Senior Legal Officer

cum Manager of the Land Redemption Department of the Bank,

as the inquiring officer.

The application relevant to this case was made by the Petitioner

to the Bank in 2004 and, after seven years of a full-blown

inquiry, the inquiring officer held in favour of the Petitioner and

recommended to the Board of Directors of the Bank by A17 that

the land be acquired.

7

The 4th Respondent had previously come before this Court by

way of a writ application against this recommendation but later

withdrew the same on the basis that the application was

premature, as the Board would ultimately take the final

decision.

After the withdrawal of the said writ application, unknown to the

Petitioner, the 4th Respondent by R15 complained against the

findings of the inquiring officer of the Bank to the Financial

Ombudsman. The R15 complaint was copied only to the

Chairman of the Bank and the Petitioner was left in the dark.

What happened thereafter is described by the Bank in its

statement of objections in the following manner:

16. The 1st Respondent was noticed of an inquiry to be held

on 26.06.2013 by the Financial Ombudsman into the

complaint made by the 4th Respondent and accordingly, the

1st Respondent attended the inquiry held by the Financial

Ombudsman on 26.06.2013.

17. At the inquiry, the Financial Ombudsman raised

concerns with regard to some of the evidence and disagreed

with the findings thereon at the inquiry held by the 2nd

Respondent and recommended that the application of the

Petitioner to the 1st Respondent for acquisition be

dismissed.

18. Consequently, the 5th to 12th Respondents concluded

that the inquiry and recommendation of the 2nd Respondent

was inconclusive and directed the 1st Respondent to re-

inquire into the application of the Petitioner to redeem the

property in question by mainly addressing the concerns

8

raised by the Financial Ombudsman and thereafter to make

a recommendation.

The Financial Ombudsmans recommendation is marked R16 by

the Bank and A24 by the Petitioner.

It is clear the Financial Ombudsman made his recommendation

against the Petitioner without giving a hearing to the Petitioner,

in grave violation of the fundamental principles of natural

justice.

The Bank was given notice of the inquiry to be held on

26.06.2013 and the Financial Ombudsman, having gone

through some of the evidence led at the inquiry, disagreed with

the findings of the inquiring officer and recommended on the

same day that the Petitioners application to the Bank be

dismissed. I do not think the course of action followed by the

Financial Ombudsman is correct. The Financial Ombudsman

cannot sit on appeal against the findings of the inquiring officer.

It is on this recommendation of the Financial Ombudsman alone

that the Board of Directors of the Bank decided to re-inquire

into the application of the Petitioner. This decision of the Board

of Directors is erroneous.

A22 is the notice sent by the new inquiring officer in relation to

the re-inquiry.

It is not the submission of learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner that the Board of Directors of the Bank should blindly

ratify the recommendations of the inquiring officer. Learned

Presidents Counsel admits that the Board can take an

independent view, having taken into account the findings and

recommendations of the inquiring officer.

9

The Board cannot totally disregard the findings and

recommendations of the inquiring officer made after an inter

parte inquiry and act only on the findings and recommendations

of the Financial Ombudsman who disagreed with the findings

and recommendations of the inquiring officer. The Board is not

bound by the findings or observations of the Financial

Ombudsman.

By filing this application, the Petitioner seeks the following main

reliefs:

(b) to issue a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari against

the 1st and 5th to 12th Respondents quashing the decision

contained in exhibit A22 dated 18th Sept 2013,

(c) to make an order [by mandamus] directing the 5th to 12th

Respondents [the Board of Directors of the Bank] to

consider the entire evidence led at the inquiry in relation to

the application made by the Petitioner and to arrive at a

decision adopting the recommendations contained in the

decision of the 2nd Respondent dated 21st Sept 2011

marked A17 and/or to make an appropriate order after

considering the factual evidence led at the inquiry held

before the 2nd Respondent.

I have no doubt the Petitioner is entitled to these two reliefs. I

grant the two reliefs to the Petitioner with costs.
