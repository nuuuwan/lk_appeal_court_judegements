In paragraph 8 of the statement of objections, the Director

General of Customs says the Petitioner has imported bottles

preform of plastic being an intermediate product having tubular

shape, with one closed end and one open end threaded to secure

screw type closure, the portion below the threaded end being

intended to be expanded to a desired size and shape. Further

elaborating on this point, in paragraph 9 he says the Petitioner

has imported bottle blanks for blowing up into bottles. To my

mind, the Petitioner does not join issue with this assertion. The

Petitioner says the same thing but in different words. The

Petitioner refers to the same product as pre-formed shrink

capsules, which are converted to plastic bottles by a process

known as the stretch blow moulding process. The issue in this

case relates to the correct HS code of this product, on which the

payable customs duties and other levies are decided.

According to the Petitioner, the correct HS code at the relevant

time for the said product was either 3923.50.10 or 3923.90.00.

According to the Director General of Customs, the correct HS

code at that time was 3923.30.90 and later 3923.30.10.

The Director General of Customs held an inquiry against the

Petitioner on the basis that the Petitioner had imported four

consignments under incorrect HS codes, thereby avoiding

payment of correct duties.

The inquiry was on three charges under sections 47 and 129 of

the Customs Ordinance. At the inquiry, four witnesses gave

evidence one for the Customs and the other three for the

4

Petitioner and several documents were marked, and written

submissions filed.

After the inquiry, the inquiring officer, the Deputy Director of

Customs, made the following Order P13.

By going through the evidence placed before me and the

plea given by the suspects I convey the following Order.

Order:

I impose M/s. Ole Springs Bottlers (Pvt) Ltd. represented by

Mr. Vishal Jain a mitigated further forfeiture amounting to

Rs. 11,742,202/- in terms of section 47, 129 & 163 of the

Customs Ordinance (Chapter 235).

I do not wish to take action against Mr. Vishal Jain holder

of Indian passport bearing No. G0101927 and I severely

warn him not to repeat this type of offences relevant to

state revenue.

Order conveyed.

The above cannot be considered an Order, as no reasons have

been given for it. For an Order to be regarded as such in the

eyes of the law, it shall be accompanied by reasons. Otherwise,

it is a mere statement unenforceable in law. Making an Order

without giving reasons is a negation of the rule of law. Where is

justice if the parties to the inquiry do not know at the end of the

day why one has won and the other has lost? The audi alteram

partem rule will be an empty ritual if reasons are not given for

decisions.

5

The inquiring officer cannot say by going through the evidence

placed before me I convey the following Order. He must justify

his conclusion by a proper evaluation of the evidence led before

him. He cannot keep the reasons to himself and release an

empty Order. He shall put down the reasons as part of the

Order for the benefit of the accused as well as the appellate body

to consider whether the conclusion is justifiable in the event the

accused appeals against the Order.

Learned Senior State Counsel submits that since the evidence of

the Deputy Superintendent of Customs in material respects was

not challenged by way of cross-examination, the inquiring officer

need not give specific reason for his decision. I totally reject this

submission. After the evidence of the said witness, three

witnesses gave evidence for the Petitioner. This was followed by

the filing of comprehensive written submissions.

The statement in the impugned Order that the Order is made

upon the plea given by the suspects is false. The suspects did

not plead guilty at any stage of the inquiry.

Learned Senior State Counsel cannot, on behalf of the inquiring

officer, give reasons for the decision in Court.

The Petitioner came before this Court predominantly seeking to

quash P13 by a writ of certiorari and seek a refund part

payment of the mitigated forfeiture on P13 by a writ of

mandamus. The Petitioner is entitled to these reliefs on the said

ground alone, i.e. failure to give reasons for the decision. There

is no necessity to go into the merits of the case. This Court, in

Chandana Kumara v. Air Vice Marshall, Sri Lanka Air Force

6

(CA/WRIT/333/2011, CA Minutes of 01.06.2020), has

exhaustively dealt with this matter. There is no necessity to

repeat the same here.

I grant the reliefs to the Petitioner as prayed for in paragraphs

(b)-(d) and (g) of the prayer to the petition.

I am not inclined to grant the relief sought in paragraph (e) of

the prayer to the petition, as the consignment mentioned therein

was not a subject matter of the impugned inquiry, and also

because I do not resolve the question of the correct HS code

regarding this product.
