01. This is a revision application preferred by the Petitioner-Petitioner (Petitioner), seeking to get

the order of the learned High Court Judge of Kandy dated 15.12.2015 affirming the order of

2

confiscation of a lorry bearing registration No. 68-2683 made by the learned Magistrate of

Matale, revised.

Background

02. The Accused was arrested by the officers of the Matale Police Station for the offence of

transporting 9 logs of Mahogany timber in a lorry without a valid permit. The Accused

pleaded guilty to the charge in the Magistrate's Court and, was sentenced. Petitioner, as the

registered owner made a claim for the lorry, and after the inquiry, the learned Magistrate

made an order to confiscate the lorry. Petitioner made an application in the High Court of

Kandy to get the said order of the learned Magistrate revised. Upon hearing the application,

the learned High Court Judge affirmed the order of confiscation by the learned Magistrate.

03. Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned High Court Judge, the instant application

was preferred by the Petitioner to get the said order revised. Counsel for the parties indicated

to the Court that the parties agree for the Court to pronounce the judgment on the written

submissions filed by them.

04. Learned counsel for the Petitioner in his written submissions urged the following grounds to

be considered by this Court.

I. Has the learned Magistrate failed to take into his consideration the fact that the

Appellant has taken precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the said offence?

2. I-las the learned Magistrate failed to take into his consideration the fact that the

Appellant has reiterated in giving precautionary measures to the Accused driver to

ensure that the vehicle is not be used for any illegal purposes?

3. Has the learned Magistrate failed to take into consideration the fact that the said

illicit transportation of timber by using the said motor lorry by the Accused driver

was committed without the knowledge of the Appellant?

3

4. Has the learned Magistrate failed in considering the nature of the degree of proof

required by the Appellant in establishing that he had taken precautionary

preventive measures to prevent the said vehicle being used for such an offence

under the Forest Ordinance as amended?

5. Has the learned Magistrate as well as the learned High Court Judge failed to take

into their accounts in deciding this matter that the Petitioner and or the Accused

driver are not habitual offenders in this nature and have no previous convictions?

05. Section 40 (I) of the Forest Ordinance provides;

"(1) when any person is convicted of a forest offence-

(a) all timber or forest produce which is not the property of the State in respect of

which such offence has been com milled; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, callie and machines used in committing such

offence,

shall in addition to any other punishment specifiedfor such offence, be confiscated by

Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles, implements and

machines used in the commission of such offence, is a third party, no order of

confiscation shall be made if such owner proves to the satisfaction of the Court that

he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of such tools, vehicles, implements,

callie and machines, as the case may be,for the commission of the offence. "

06. Hence, it is clear that, to prevent the confiscation of the lorry, the Petitioner (owner) has to

prove to the satisfaction of the Court, that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of

the vehicle for the commission of the offence, in this case transporting timber without a

valid permit.

4

07. Learned counsel for the Petitioner has submitted that the Petitioner testified in the

Magistrate's Court that he took precautions to prevent the use of his vehicle for the

commission of such an offence. Learned counsel referred to the portions of the evidence

given by the Petitioner in the Magistrate's Court.

08. It is the submission of the learned State counsel for the Respondent that the evidence of the

Petitioner had been, that he had given mere verbal instructions to the Accused, but had not

disclosed any other measures that were taken by him to ensure the vehicle not been used for

illegal purposes.

09. In the Magistrate's Court, the evidence of the Petitioner (owner) was that he had given the

lorry to the Accused on rent, to hire the same to transport sand, bricks etc. Monthly rent to

be paid to the Petitioner by the Accused had been Rs.30, 000/-. However, he had said that

the lorry was brought to him weekly, where he gave instructions to the Accused not to use

the lorry to transport timber and for illegal activities.

10. In case of Mary Matilda Silva V. P.H. de Silva, Inspector of Police, Habaral/a leA (PHC)

86/97, decided on 08. 07. 201 OJ, His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew discussed about the

owner taking all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of the

offence. His Lordship Justice Sisira de Abrew said;

"In my view, for the owner of the vehicle to discharge the burden (J)

that he/she had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of the offence (2) that the vehicle had been used for the

commission of the offence without his/her knowledge, mere giving instructions

is not sufficient. In order to discharge the burden embodied in the proviso to

section 3A of the Animals Act is it sufficient for the owner to say that

instructions not to use the vehicle for illegal purpose had been given to the

driver? if the courts of this country is going (0 say that it is sufficient, then all

what the owner in a case of this nature has to say is that he gave said

instructions. Even for the second offence, this is all that he has to say. Then

(here is no end to the commission of the offence and (0 the use of the vehicle

for the commission of the offence. Every time when the vehicle is detected

5

with cattle all what he has to say is that he had given instructions to the

driver. Then the purpose of the legislature in enacting the proviso to section

3A of the Animals Act isfrustrated ... ln the instant case the owner did not call

her driver and establish that she had given instructions to him . ... The idea of

the proviso is not to protect the owner who is privy to the offence. If his

behaviour indicates that he is privy to the offence then he has not discharged

the said burden. "

Although it was a case under the Animals Act, the same principle applies to this case as well.

II . Petitioner says that he gave verbal instructions to the driver. However, Petitioner has failed to

call the Accused driver to give evidence or to cite him as a witness, when the driver was the

best person other than himself to testify to the fact that the Petitioner took precautions to

prevent the commission of the offence. His evidence shows that he had failed to take

meaningful steps to prevent the vehicle being used to transport timber. His evidence makes it

obvious that the hiring of the lorry, for whatever purpose, had been decided by the Accused,

not by the Petitioner, when the lorry was with the Accused on a monthly rental basis.

Petitioner had given a free hand to the Accused to decide on the hire. Therefore, the learned

Magistrate rightly concluded that the Petitioner had failed to place the evidence to the

satisfaction of the Court on the reasonable steps or precautions that he had taken to prevent

the vehicle being used for illegal activities, in this case, to transport 9 logs of Mahogany

timber without a valid permit, as required in the proviso to section 40(1) of the Forest

Ordinance.

12. Learned counsel for the Petitioner has also submitted that the learned Magistrate failed to

take into consideration that the illicit transportation of timber was committed by the driver,

without the knowledge of the Petitioner.

13. It is the contention of the learned State counsel that, the fact that the offence was committed

without the knowledge of the Petitioner does not become a ground to release the vehicle to

the owner in terms of the proviso to ,section 40(1) of the Forest Ordinance, although it is an

expressed ground when an offence was committed under the Animals Act.

6

14. In case of Manawadu V. The Attomey General /1987J 2 Sri L.R. 30, it was held that the

owner of the lorry who is not a party to the case is entitled to be heard on the question of

forfeiture of the lorry. If he satisfies the Court that the Accused committed the offence

without his knowledge or participation, his lorry will not be liable to forfeiture.

15. Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance was amended by Act No. 65 of 2009 (certified on 16th

November 2009) by adding the proviso to section 40( I). Although the added proviso did not

speak about' knowledge' on the part of the owner in committing the offence, our Superior

Courts have continuously followed the principle laid down in 'Manawadll' case.

16. In case of Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd. V. Range forest Officer, Ampara,

/SC Appeal 12012011, decided on 10.12.2013J, Supreme Court held;

"The Supreme Court has consistently followed the case of Manawadll

V. Attomey General. Therefore, it is sellled law that before an order for

forfeiture is made the owner should be given an opportunity to show cause. If

the owner on balance of probability satisfies the Court that he has taken

precalllions to prevent the commission of the offence or the offence was

committed without his knowledge nor he was privy to the commission of the

offence then the vehicle has to be released to the owner. "

17. In this context I wish to reproduce a paragraph by His Lordship Sharvananda C.J. In

'Manawadll ' case;

"If the construction contended by State counsel is right the

consequences of that interpretation are indeed far-reaching, it would follow

that ifa thiefsteals aperson 's vehicle and uses the vehicle to commit aforest

offence, the owner of the vehicle will have his car forfeited for no fault of his.

That appears to be a strange conclusion because the owner had done no act

himself. Further, such a construction will render the owner helpless against

collusion or conspiracy between the prosecutor and the Accused to deprive the

owner of his vehicle .... "

7

18. Hence, it is clear and justifiable that no order of confiscation should be made if the owner

satisfies the Court that he had no knowledge in commission of the offence, although it is not

expressly provided in the proviso to section 40(1).

19. In case of W. Jalathge SlIrasena V. O.I.e. Hikkadllwa and others. (CA (PHC) APN

100/1014), it was held that mere denial by the registered owner that he did not have the

knowledge of the commission of the offence is not sufficient to prevent the confiscation of

a vehicle.

20. There are some English authorities for the view that in the criminal law, 'knowledge'

includes willfully shutting one's eyes to the truth.

21. In case of Westminister City COIIl/cil V. Croyalgrange Ltd., CR. App. R 155 at 164, Lord

Bridge said;

" it is always open to the tribunal of fact ... to base a finding of

knowledge on evidence that the defendant had deliberately shut his eyes to the

obvious to refrain from inquiry because he suspected a truth but did not wish

to have his suspicion confirmed. "

22. The burden is on the owner (Petitioner) to satisfy Court that he had taken all precautions to

prevent the commission of the offence or that he had no knowledge on the commission of

the offence. Whether the Petitioner has fulfilled the said burden on 'knowledge " has to be

decided on the facts and circumstances including the evidence adduced at the vehicle

inquiry. As mentioned before in this judgment in paragraph II the Petitioner has failed to

fulfill that burden on the precautions taken by him. He has merely let the Accused to decide

on what hire he would take and therefore could have anticipated the commission of such

offences in today's context.

23. In case of Joslin V. Bal/dara, (74 N.L.R. 48), it was held that an order of confiscation of a

lorry under section 40 of the Forest Ordinance cannot be made against the owner if he was

not in anyway privy to the commission of the offence or had no reason to anticipate the

commission of the offence.

8

24. Precautions taken or the absence of any precautions taken by the owner must be determined

in relation to the actual offence committed and the circumstances under which it was

committed. CB. M. Mendis V. Rallge Forest Officer, Kamburupitiya (CA PHC 23/93,

16.02.98).

25. Learned counsel for the Petitioner has submitted that the learned Magistrate has failed to

take into account that the Accused and the Petitioner were not habitual offenders. Court

may consider the fact that the Accused was not a habitual offender, when arriving at the

conclusion on the fact of' knowledge' on the part of the Petitioner. However, if the Court

finds that the Petitioner has failed to fulfill the burden cast upon him at the inquiry as

mentioned before, the fact that the Accused or the Petitioner not being a habitual offender

would have no bearing on the forfeiture of the vehicle.

26. In the above premise, I find that the learned Magistrate has rightly concluded that the

Petitioner has failed to prove to the satisfaction of the Court that he has taken all

precautions to prevent the commission of the offence, or that the offence was committed

without his knowledge nor he was privy to the commission of the offence. Hence, 1 see no

reason to interfere with the judgment of the learned Magistrate dated 21.07.2014, or with

the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 15.12.2015.

Revision application is dismissed.
