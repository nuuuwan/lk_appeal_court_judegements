ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 1st to 3rd accused-appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st to 3rd

Appellants respectively) were indicted by the Hon. Attorney General before the

High Court of Puttalam for committing murder of one Mohammed Anwar on or

about 08.07.2006.

After trial they were convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to

murder by the trial Court and sentenced each of them to serve a ten-year term of

imprisonment with imposition of a fine of Rs.5000.00 which carried a default

sentence of six months of imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellants have

invoked appellate jurisdiction of this Court seeking to set them aside.

Learned President's Counsel at the hearing of their appeal raised the

.following grounds of appeal;

2

a. the trial Court had failed to properly analyse the evidence of the 1st

prosecution witness,

b. the trial Court had erroneously rejected the defence evidence,

c. the trial Court had erroneously acted on hearsay evidence as to the

motive,

d. the trial Court had misdirected itself when it held that the Appellants

have failed to offer an explanation,

e. there was no proper adoption of proceedings.

In support of the first ground of appeal, it was contended by the learned

President's Counsel that the trial Court had failed to properly analyse the

evidence of the 1st prosecution witness in two important aspects. Firstly, the trial

Court failed to note that the prosecution had brought in a "new" witness, by

substituting the witness, who had already been listed on the back of the

indictment with the one who eventually gave evidence. Secondly, it was

contended that the 1st prosecution witness is a belated witness, who made no

statement to Police and has contradicted himself with the medical evidence.

It was highlighted by the Appellants that the prosecution had listed one

Jras Munaf Mohammed Grahunia of 75, "a)~" Road, Puttalam, at the back of its

indictment but instead called one Abdul Munaf Mohammed Safran of 75, Spill

Road, Puttalam before the trial Court to give evidence. It was also highlighted

that ASP Piyasiri Fernando has admitted that no statement of Iras Munaf

Mohammed Grahunia or Abdul Munaf Mohammed Safran was recorded during

investigations into this incident.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in his reply has referred to the

proceedings of 27.09.2010, where the prosecution has made an application to the

3

trial Court to amend the indictment to change name of its 1st prosecution witness

from Iras Munaf Mohammed Grahunia to Abdul Munaf Mohammed Safran. Learned

prosecutor indicated that the said name is mentioned in the further report filed

in Court on 09.07.2006. The trial Court, having noted that prima facie it is so,

however had directed the prosecution to confirm this position. On 28.09.2010, the

prosecution presented the passport of the said witness and the Court had

amended the name of the witness on 06.10.2010, as Abdul Munaf Mohammed

Safran. His evidence was led immediately thereafter by the prosecution. At the

time of administering oath, the witness Abdul Munaf Mohammed Safran gave his

address as 75, Spill Road, Puttalam and, during examination in chief said it is

"c:m:r/' Road. The witness claimed that he made a statement to Police over the

incident. During cross examination, the witness said that he made his statement

on the day of the incident itself and it was never suggested by the Appellants

that he never made a statement or he is introduced to the case belatedly.

The investigating officer ASP Piyasiri Fernando, during his further cross

examination twice admitted that the statement of Abdul Munaf Mohammed Safran

of 75, "e:m:r!" Road, Puttalam, was recorded during his investigations as an eye

witness to the incident. He was unable to clarify as to who gave evidence during

the non-summary proceedings. Strangely, the witness replied in the negative

when he was questioned whether a statement is recorded under the "amended

name" but admitted that statement of Ayuruf Munaf Mohammed Susnia is

recorded under paragraph 109.

This obscure position regarding the name of the eye-witness was

considered by the trial Court as revealed by the proceedings of 30.06.2016.

4

It is clear that the witness Abdul Munaf Mohammed Safran was sometime

referred to in the proceedings as Abdul Munaf Mohammed Susnia and Ayuruf

Munaf Mohammed Susnia provided they were recorded accurately. But the fact

remained that his statement was recorded by the Police on the day of the incident

itself and was treated as an eye-witness to the incident. The Appellants have

cross examined him on the footing that he made a statement to Police.

Thus, the material available does not support the claim of the learned

President's Counsel that the prosecution had "introduced" a new and a

"belated" witness for the first time in the High Court, who never made any

statement. This seeming ambiguity into the name of the eye witness could have

been easily avoided during the trial, if the prosecutor in leading evidence and the

Court recording that evidence, were more attentive when references were made

to his name in the proceedings.

Moving on to the second aspect of the Appellant's challenge on the

evidence of the said witness on the basis that it contradicts the medical evidence,

it is noted that what the witness said in evidence is that he saw the three

Appellants at a distance and at about 7.00 p.m.. According to the witness it was

the 3rd Appellant who struck the deceased on his head and back of his chest. He

did not see any weapon in the 3rd Appellant's hand. The medical evidence is to

the effect that the deceased had suffered two stab injuries and an abrasion. The

1st stab injury was located on the left side of the head, above the lobe of left ear

while the 2nd stab injury located about six inches from the neck, on the back of his

chest. Internally the 1st stab injury had lacerated the brain tissues causing internal

bleeding and therefore is termed as a necessarily fatal injury. This injury could

have been caused by a sharp pointed weapon.

5

The mere absence of a reference to a weapon seen in the hands of the 3rd

Appellant by the witness could not have resulted in an adverse impact on the

truthfulness and reliability of the eye witness's account solely due to that factor.

It is evident that the witness had seen the incident which took place

around 7.00 p.m. with limited light and from a distance of about 38 meters. He

saw the l sI and 2nd Appellants holding the deceased from either side and the 3rd

Appellant, who arrived at the scene from a by lane, striking the latter twice on

the head and back of his chest. With that the three Appellants have dispersed

and the deceased had merely collapsed thereafter.

Clearly the witness's description as to the locations, where the 3rd

Appellant had struck the deceased, matches with the location of the injuries as

observed by the medical witness during the post mortem examination.

The Appellants, during their cross examination of witness Piyasiri

Fernando, have questioned him as to whether it was revealed during

investigation that the weapon that had been used in this crime is a carpenter's

chisel and the witness replied in the affirmative. That being the evidence before

the trial Court, it is reasonable to assume that the witness may not have seen the

chisel in the 3rd Appellant's hand owing to its small size since he saw the incident

from a distance and in limited light. On the contrary the failure of the witness to

observe any weapon with the 3rd Appellant, strengthens his credibility as he

spoke truthfully only of what he saw without adding to his narration upon

hearing what was told by others.

In view of the above considerations, this Court holds that the 151 ground of

appeal raised by the Appellants is devoid of any merit.

6

The complaint by the Appellants that their evidence was wrongly rejected

by the trial Court is based on the conclusion reached by the Court on the

testimonial trustworthiness of the wibless called by the 2 nd Appellant namely,

Mohammed Badurdeen Mohammed Infas. The defence wibless said in his evidence

that news of the attack on the deceased had reached him while he was chatting

with the alleged eye wibless, while munching peanuts. At that point of time,

they were some 7 kilo meters away from the place where the incident took place.

It was submitted by the learned President's Counsel that the said wibless

did not make any statement to Police, confirming the fact that the alleged eye

wi bless was with him at the time of the incident and therefore had no

opportunity to wibless the incident, simply because, the said defence wi bless

came to know of the fact that the alleged eye wi bless gave evidence against the

2nd Appellant only when he returned from his foreign employment in March

2016 and therefore the rejection of his evidence on the basis of belatedness by the

trial Court is clearly wrong.

The trial Court, in evaluating credibility of the defence wibless, had

considered his testimony by applying several tests of credibility on his

testimony. The trial Court had applied not only the test of spontaneity but also

the tests of probability and interestedness or disinterestedness. It also had the

advantage of observing the demeanour and deportment of the defence wibless in

assessing credibility.

In applying the test of interested ness or disinterestedness, the trial Court

had considered the evidence that the wibless was invited by the 2nd Appellant to

give evidence on his behalf and that the wibless wanted to travel abroad again

for employment but his passport is kept by the 2nd Appellant.

7

The evaluation of the defence witness's evidence for credibility and the

conclusion reached by the trial Court upon such evaluation is based on the

application of several tests. In addition, this Court notes that the evidence of the

2nd Appellant was in fact belated. The reason given by the learned President's

Counsel even if it is accepted, the delay of the defence witness in coming

forward as a witness could not be accepted due to the reasons stated below.

The evidence of the sole eye witness was led by the prosecution on

06.10.2006. Obviously, if the defence witness was discovered only in March 2016

by the 2nd Appellant, the eye witness could not have been confronted during

cross examination with the fact that he was elsewhere when the incident

happened. The 2nd Appellant made his statement from the dock on 07.11.2016

and he called the defence witness on 24.01.2017 .

According to the said defence witness, he had told the 2nd Appellant that

the eye witness was with him at the time of the incident, munching peanuts, in

March 2016, when the latter casually mentioned to the former that he was

implicated by the eye witness for the death of the deceased. By March 2016 the

2nd Appellant knew that his witness had seen the eye witness some 7 kilometers

away when the incident of stabbing took place. Surprisingly, the 2nd Appellant

did not make even a passing reference to what he had learnt from his witness, a

mere seven months ago, in his dock statement. He was content with the already

suggested general position of all the Appellants that the eye witness is lying in

Court. The silence on the part of the 2nd Appellant over the discovery of his

witness and the circumstances under which he had found this important witness

8

had rendered the evidence of the defence witness not credible due to its

inconsistency and belatedness.

As the trial Court noted the defence witness admitted that he was reluctant

to come forward as a witness but due to persistent efforts of the 2nd Appellant

only he had decided to disclose what he know of the eye witness. He also

admitted in cross examination that his passport is in the custody of the 2nd

Appellant and as he wanted his passport back in order to travel abroad, he came

to give evidence at the insistence of the said Appellant (" o q1Clol lOS .!!J~oo

o)O\Ii 1;o!D.!!J 6l~C). ~Gl) (SeD O)) Cl~(3;) (3)o!D QI(SoQ)Gl 6\i?lo!D. ~ iDo) Cl~(3;) (3)0)

This indicates that the 2nd Appellant had retained the witness's passport as

a security and thereby compelling him to give evidence on his behalf. This fact

seriously challenges the truthfulness of the witness's claim of seeing the eye

witness at some distance away from the scene, a position that had been advanced

belatedly. Thus, in the circumstances it is evident that the trial Court's decision to

reject the defence witness's claim was based on the reasonable inferences that

had been reached upon the available evidence and therefore is amply justified.

Accordingly, this ground of appeal also fails.

The Appellants have also raised a ground of appeal on the basis that the

trial Court had erroneously acted on hearsay evidence as to the motive. This

complaint is founded upon the evidence of the investigating officer. During cross

examination of the witness Piyasiri Fernando, the Appellants have questioned him

as to what he had learnt from the "evidence" in relation to this crime. It is in

answer to the said question, the witness had repeated what he learnt during

investigations. According to the witness, the deceased had an affair with the

9

daughter of the 1st Appellant and there had been an exchange of words between

the two sides just before the incident. There was no challenge to that item of

evidence of the witness by any of the Appellants.

In considering the evidence the trial Court had arrived at the finding that

the Appellants had entertained an intention only to cause injury which is

sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, in spite of the clear

medical evidence that it is a necessarily fatal injury and thereby had reduced

their culpability from murder to culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

Clearly the trial Court had not utilised the said item of hearsay evidence elicited

through the witness by the Appellant themselves to impose criminal liability on

them.

The complaint that the trial Court had shifted burden on the Appellants

when it observed that when a prima facie case is established against the

Appellants, in the absence of an explanation it could draw an inference of guilt,

should be considered by this Court now.

In the impugned judgment the relevant portion where the Court had held

so, appears as follows;

" Clcic; c>OladJ() ClOz~Cla Q)1~Q)1@() .!ll~c>Octll

In Ajith Fernando v Attorney General (2004) 1 Sri L.R. 288, a bench

consisting of five judges of the Supreme Court, has considered a similar

contention advanced by the appellant before their Lordships.

10

Their Lordships have stated that;

"While urging further that the judges of the High Court at Bar

erred in law by attributing guilt on the basis that the accused failed

to offer any explanation in regard to the prima facie evidence led

against them, it was contended that the burden did lie on the

prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, independent

of any explanation required to be offered by the accused.

In rejecting the said contention advanced by the appellant, their Lordships

have quoted Lord Ellenborough and stated that;

"The failure of the accused to give or offer evidence in respect of

these matters justify the application of the following dictum of Lord

Ellenborough in R v Lord Cochrane and Others (1814)

Guruey's Reports 479

"No person accused of cTlme IS bound to offer any

explanation of his conduct or of circumstances of suspicion

which attach to him; but, nevertheless, if he refuses to do so,

where a strong prima facie case has been made out, and when

it is in his own power to offer evidence, if such exist, in

explanation of such suspicious circumstances which would

show them to be fallacious and explicable consistently with

his innocence, it is a reasonable and justifiable conclusion

that he refrains from doing so only from his conviction that

the evidence so suppressed or not adduced would operate

adversely to his interest."

11

Thus it is clear that the trial Court had merely stated the said principle of

law that had been recognised in Sri Lanka in its impugned judgment. But the

trial Court had omitted one important part from the said statement. That is there

should be a "strong prima facie" case already established by the prosecution for

the said dictum to apply and the trial Court in this instance speaks of

establishing only of a "prima facie case". When the said sentence is considered in

the proper context it is evident that the said statement was made after

considering the several items of evidence that had been presented by the

prosecution, by which it had established a strong prima facie case. The mere

absence of the word "strong" would not therefore render the judgment of the

trial Court invalid as it is clearly evident the trial Court was mindful of the

requirement of a strong prima facie case for the said dictum to apply. This ground

of appeal therefore fails.

Lastly this Court proceeds to examine the validity of the complaint by the

Appellants that there was no proper adoption of evidence under Section 48 of the

Judicature Act. Learned President's Counsel invited attention of Court to the

proceedings of 21.05.2013, where the succeeding trial Judge had proceeded to

hear evidence of the medical witness but no reference was made regarding any

adoption of proceedings that had already taken place, under Section 48 of the

Judicature Act.

The trial against the Appellants has commenced before a different trial

Judge, who was succeeded by the 2nd trial Judge, who in turn had proceeded

from the point the trial was adjourned by his predecessor on 21.05.2013. It is

correct that there is no record confirming of any adoption of proceedings before

the said succeeding judge. He too had been succeeded by a third trial Judge on

17.11.2015, who eventually delivered the impugned judgment. What is important 12

here is that the proceedings were properly adopted before the 2nd succeeding

trial Judge, and in fact a witness, whose evidence had already been led before his

immediate predecessor, was recalled by the said trial Judge, upon an application

of the Appellants made under Section 48. On 01.06.2017, the said trial Judge

delivered his judgment, after the defence case was heard by him in its entirety.

Hence, this Court is of the view that there is proper adoption of evidence by the

trial Court, as mandated by Section 48 of the Judicature Act (as emended). This

ground of appeal too therefore fails.

In view of the fact that none of the grounds urged by the Appellants have

succeeded, the conviction and sentence imposed on the Appellants are affirmed

by this Court.

The appeals of the 1st to 3rd Appellants are therefore dismissed.
