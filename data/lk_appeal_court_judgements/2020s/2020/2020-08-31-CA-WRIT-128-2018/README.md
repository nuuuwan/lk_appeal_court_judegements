Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash

the decision of the 1st Respondent, Director General of Sports, marked X20, by

which the Petitioner was informed inter alia that he has been banned from

participating in any, and/or organising any motor sports event for a period of three

years.

The Sports Law No. 25 of 1973, as amended (the Law) provides the legal framework

for the regulation and supervision of sports in Sri Lanka. In terms of Section 28, the

Minister may, by Order published in the Gazette, name any sport or group of sports

for which a National Association may be formed. Section 29 provides for the

formation of a National Association in respect of a sport named in an Order made

under Section 28 of the Law.

The Minister of Sports, acting in terms of Section 31 read with Section 41 of the Law,

has made Regulations containing provisions relating inter alia to the registration of

National Associations of Sports. Schedule II of the said Regulations marked X23 lists

the names of the sports for which there can be a National Association, and includes

Automobile Sports. It is not in dispute that the National Association for motor sports

in Sri Lanka is the Sri Lanka Automobile Sports Association (SLAS), and that several

clubs, including the Sri Lanka Auto Sports Drivers Association (SLARDAR) are affiliated

to the SLAS.

The Petitioner states that he is a successful racing car driver who has been involved

in motor racing in Sri Lanka since 2000, and that he has won several motor sport

events over the years. The Petitioner has stated further that the Colombo Super

Cross motor racing event is an annual motor racing event conducted by SLARDAR,

and that the said event for the year 2017 had been held on 7th May 2017. It is agreed

by the parties that the Petitioner, the 10th Respondent and several others had

participated in Event No. 17, known as the Ford Laser/Mazda 1500cc event. The

Petitioner claims that during the said event, the 10th Respondent had deliberately

collided his vehicle with the vehicle of the Petitioner, causing damage to both

5

vehicles. The Petitioner states that due to the said collision, the Petitioner was only

able to secure 2nd place at the said event.

The rules governing the said event require any complaint or protest to be lodged

with the Officials of the event within 30 minutes of the completion of the event, and

for a payment of Rs. 15,000 to be made at the time the complaint is lodged. The

Petitioner claims that he lodged a protest over the said incident and paid the

required fee, and that he expected SLARDAR to act on his complaint.

It is not in dispute that the 10th Respondent did not lodge a complaint regarding the

aforementioned incident with the Event Officials. Instead, the 10th Respondent, by a

letter dated 10th May 2017 marked 10R5 had made the following complaint to the

2nd Respondent, who was the Minister of Sports at that time:

Acting on the said complaint, the 1st Respondent, by a letter dated 11th May 2017

marked R5 had appointed a Committee consisting of the 4th Respondent, Assistant

Director (Sports), Ministry of Sports, and two others, to inquire into the said

complaint 10R5, and submit a report. An inquiry had accordingly been conducted by

the said Committee with the participation of the Petitioner, the 10th Respondent, the

officials of SLARDAR and SLAS. The Petitioner has no complaint with the manner in

which the said inquiry was conducted, nor is the Petitioner complaining about the

hearing that was afforded to him.

6

After the conclusion of the inquiry, the said Committee had submitted their report

dated 7th December 2017 marked R21 to the Minister of Sports through the 1st

Respondent, and the 3rd Respondent, the Secretary, Ministry of Sports. For the

reasons set out therein, the Inquiry Panel had found that the Petitioner had

deliberately obstructed the 10th Respondent during the event, and had therefore

recommended that the maximum punishment be imposed on the Petitioner.

The 1st Respondent had thereafter sent the letter dated 9th January 2018 marked

X20 to the Petitioner. X20 reads as follows:

Aggrieved by X20, the Petitioner had lodged an appeal dated 10th January 2018

marked X21 with the 2nd Respondent. Although by letter dated 8th February 2018

marked X22 the Petitioner had been directed to be present for an inquiry on 20th

February 2018, this Court has not been apprised of either the outcome of the said

inquiry, or the decision of the Minister with regard to the said appeal.1

It is only thereafter that the Petitioner filed this application, seeking a Writ of

Certiorari to quash X20, on the following two grounds:

(a) The Director General of Sports and/or the Minister of Sports does not have the

power to conduct an inquiry into the complaint 10R5;

(b) The Petitioner has been deprived of an unbiased hearing in the exercise of his

statutory right of appeal to the Minister, in view of the involvement of the

Minister of Sports in the decision making process culminating in X20.

I shall now consider the first argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner, which is twofold. He submitted that whenever a complaint is lodged over

an incident that occurs at a sporting event, disciplinary action must first be initiated

by the Club that conducts the sporting event SLARDAR in this instance - with a right

of appeal against the decision to the National Association of Sports being the SLAS -

and a final right of appeal to the Minister of Sports. He submitted further that the

Minister of Sports, and/or the Director General of Sports does not have the

jurisdiction to conduct an inquiry to determine liability and that their jurisdiction is

limited to hearing appeals once liability has been determined by the National

Association.

1 Vide paragraph 43 of the petition, which has been denied in paragraph 3 of the Statement of Objections of the 1st 5th Respondents.

8

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner drew the attention of this Court to

a set of rules that are applicable to sporting events conducted by SLARDAR, marked

X5. Rule X thereof further that all protests must be made in writing on the

prescribed form available with the Paddock Marshall and delivered to the Race

Director / Clerk of the Court or to the Secretary of the Meet for onward transmission

to the Stewards of the meet, with the receipt of payment obtained from the paddock

marshall after paying the non-refundable protest fees in cash.

The Petitioner states that once a complaint has been lodged, the next step is for the

SLARDAR to commence action in terms of the Sporting Code issued by the SLAS,

marked X7. The addendum to Part X of X7 specifies the procedure to be followed

in the first instance by Club stewards when inquiring into complaints relating to

violations and breaches committed by competitors and drivers. Accordingly, a

preliminary investigation shall be carried out by SLARDAR, and if the material

discloses that an offence has been committed by a driver, a formal disciplinary

inquiry shall be conducted by the disciplinary committee of SLARDAR. Paragraph

15.32 of Part X requires the findings of the disciplinary committee to be submitted to

the Council of SLARDAR for a final decision to be taken, including the punishment

that is to be imposed. In terms of Rule 15.33, In the event of the Club council

considering that a general ban should be imposed on the accused it will forward the

report of the disciplinary committee together with its recommendations to the

President of SLAS.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the SLAS does not

have the jurisdiction to take disciplinary action against a competitor or conduct an

inquiry, and that SLAS can only act as an appellate body. The former position does

not appear to be strictly correct. Rule 10.02 of X7 specifies that, the disciplinary

committee of SLAS shall have the power to take any immediate action on behalf of

the SLAS in respect of a Club, official or a competitor against whom any complaint

may be made to any member of the Council of SLAS, or any incident or matter on

which the Disciplinary Committee may consider that immediate action is necessary.

It also appears from Rule 9.12 and Rule 12.01 of X7 that the SLAS has the power to

take direct disciplinary action in the circumstances mentioned therein. The position

9

therefore appears to be that where a complaint/protest is lodged, an inquiry needs

to be conducted by SLARDAR, with a right of appeal against the decision of SLARDAR

being available to the SLAS. However, in the circumstances mentioned in the

aforementioned Rules, SLAS can on its own initiative, take action.

Regulation 8(1) of the Regulations marked X23 provides that any person who is

aggrieved by any decision or action of a registered National Association of Sports

may appeal to the Minister. In terms of Regulation 8(2), The Minister shall on

consideration of all relevant facts inform his decision to the Appellant and the

relevant National Association of Sports.

Similar provision is found in Section 30 of the Law, which reads as follows:

Any person who is aggrieved by any decision or action of a registered National

Association of Sports may, in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this

Law, appeal to the Minister against such decision or action and the Minister's

decision on such appeal shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned

in any court of law.

Thus, even if SLAS can take action on its own initiative, what is important however is

the submission that in any event, the Minister of Sports only has appellate power,

and that neither the Minister nor the Director General of Sports has the power to

conduct an inquiry into an incident, unless such an inquiry is being conducted in the

exercise of its appellate power.

It is in these circumstances that I must consider if the 1st or 2nd Respondents have

acted ultra vires their powers by appointing a Committee, and conducting an inquiry,

other than in the course of the appellate jurisdiction conferred in terms of Section

30.

Having identified illegality as one of the grounds on which a decision of an

administrative body could be subjected to judicial review, Lord Diplock in Council of

Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service2 described illegality as follows:

2 1985 AC 374.

10

By illegality as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-maker

must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power

and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable

question to be decided, in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by

whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable.

As stated in De Smiths Judicial Review3:

The task for the courts in evaluating whether a decision is illegal is essentially

one of construing the content and scope of the instrument conferring the duty

or power upon the decision-maker. The courts when exercising this power or

construction are enforcing the rule of law, by requiring administrative bodies

to act within the four corners of their powers or duties.

The learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the 1st 5th Respondents is not

disputing the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner that the

Minister and/or the Director General of Sports does not have the power to conduct

an inquiry. He however submitted that by an Order marked R3 published in the

Extraordinary Gazette No 1986/61 dated 30th September 2016, the Minister of

Sports, acting in terms of Section 39(1) of the Law had appointed the 1st Respondent

as the Competent Authority for SLAS until an election is held lawfully, and for the

purpose of convening the election of the SLAS to elect new office bearers. The

learned Senior State Counsel accordingly submitted that the 1st Respondent did not

conduct the inquiry in his capacity as Director General, but by virtue of being the

Competent Authority of the SLAS.

I cannot agree with the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel that the 1st

Respondent had acted qua SLAS when he directed that an inquiry be conducted by

the 4th Respondent, for the following reasons:

a) The 10th Respondent made the complaint 10R5 to the Minister of Sports, with

copy to the 1st Respondent, and not to the SLAS;

3Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review (8th Edition, 2018), Sweet and Maxwell, page 245-246.

11

b) The 1st Respondent appointed the Committee chaired by the 4th Respondent

acting on the said letter sent to the Minister vide R5;

c) The correspondence that the 4th Respondent had with the Petitioner makes it

clear that he is inquiring into the complaint made by the 10th Respondent to the

Minister vide R7, R9, R10;

d) The correspondence that the 4th Respondent had with the SLARDAR also makes

it clear that the inquiry is being held pursuant to the complaint of the 10th

Respondent to the Minister vide R17;

e) The report of the Committee, marked R21 is addressed to the Minister, and

specifically refers to it being a Committee appointed on a complaint made to

the Minister;

f) The decision X20 conveyed to the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent refers to

the fact that the inquiry was conducted pursuant to the complaint made to the

Minister.

I must also note that the 1st Respondent was appointed as Competent Authority only

until a new set of office bearers were appointed to the SLAS. Although this Court has

not been apprised of the date on which the elections to the SLAS were held, the

following documents establish that the SLAS had a set of office bearers by 9th

October 2017, which is the last date on which the said inquiry was held, and which is

therefore prior to the submission of the report R21:

(a) The attendance sheet marked R15 containing the names of those who were

present on the second date of inquiry including the Secretary of SLAS.

(b) X20 which had been copied to SLAS, with the following endorsement setting

out the reason for X20 being copied - by; i|yka jskhdkql+, mshjr ms<sn|

wjYH bosrs lghq;= i|yd

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that:

12

(a) Neither the Director General of Sports, nor the Minister of Sports have the

power to conduct an inquiry into a complaint arising out of an incident that

occurs in a sporting event conducted by SLARDAR, unless such an inquiry is

being held in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction conferred by the Minister

by Section 30; and

(b) The 1st Respondent and the 4th Respondent acted outside their jurisdiction by

conducting an inquiry, and arriving at findings against the Petitioner.

A decision reached after such a process in my view is illegal, and is liable to be

quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

The second complaint of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that

the Minister has clearly been involved in the decision making process that

culminated in X20, and that such involvement on the part of the Minister has

deprived the Petitioner of a fair and unbiased hearing in the exercise of his statutory

right of appeal to the Minister.

I have already referred to the framework within which disciplinary action must be

taken by SLARDAR, and the role played by the SLAS as an appellate body in the event

a ban is imposed on a participant. Even if I accept the position of the learned Senior

State Counsel that SLAS has the authority to hold an inquiry into the conduct of the

Petitioner and that the 1st Respondent conducted the said inquiry in his capacity as

the Competent Authority for SLAS, the Petitioner would still have a right of appeal to

the Minister in terms of Section 30 of the Act.

However, the penultimate paragraph of X20 makes it clear that the approval of the

Minister has been granted for the punishment imposed on the Petitioner. Therefore,

any appeal to the Minister would be an exercise in vain, as the Minister cannot

review a decision which has been approved by him. The learned Counsel for the 10th

Respondent has submitted in his written submissions that when the document

marked X20 is read holistically in context, the said phrase reflects a warning issued to

the petitioner considering his prior misconduct and punishment given for his wrongful

behavior at a motorcycle race in Kandy. However, my understanding of the said

13

paragraph in X20 is that the imposition of the punishment in respect of the Super

Cross 2017 event has been approved by the Minister, thereby depriving the

Petitioner of a fair and unbiased hearing of his appeal.

I am therefore in agreement with the second submission of the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner, and am of the view that X20 is liable to be quashed, on

this ground as well.

Before concluding, I must state that the Petitioner and the 10th Respondent appear

to have lost sight of the fact that they are mere competitors in a sporting event. As

submitted by the learned Counsel for the 10th Respondent, discipline among

sportsmen and sportswomen is paramount, and any breach must be dealt with

strictly, but in accordance with the law. The Committee chaired by the 4th

Respondent, having had the benefit of watching the video footage relating to the

incident, has in its report R21 exhaustively dealt with the manner in which the

Petitioner had obstructed the 10th Respondent, and the counter steps that had been

taken by the 10th Respondent. Unfortunately, the 1st 4th Respondents have been

over zealous, and in the process drifted outside their jurisdiction, leaving this Court

with no other option, but to quash their decisions.

In the above circumstances, I issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

contained in X20. I make no order with regard to costs.
