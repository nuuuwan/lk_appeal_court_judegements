Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This case is connected to CA/WRIT/275/2017, in which the

Judgment was delivered today.

The facts of both matters and the pleadings are almost identical;

only the names of the Petitioners are different.

Both matters were argued together. Learned Counsel for both

parties agreed to abide by a single Judgment to be delivered in

the connected case.

The parties in the instant case are bound by the Judgment

delivered in CA/WRIT/275/2017 today.

Accordingly, the application of the Petitioners is dismissed but

without costs.
