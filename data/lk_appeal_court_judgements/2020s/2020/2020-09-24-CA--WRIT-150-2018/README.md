Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Although the Petitioner filed this application against the

Respondents seeking several prerogative writs, at the time of the

argument the Petitioner confined the application only to the

relief as prayed for in paragraph (d) of the prayer to the petition,

i.e. a writ of prohibition preventing the 1st-4th Respondents from

constructing a roadway over the land claimed by the Petitioner

depicted in Plan P1B without recourse to the due process of the

law.

Plan P1B depicts a land known as Mahawatta in extent of 2

acres and 29.8 perches, which the Petitioner claims title to by

Deed of Gift marked P1A. Several lands appearing to abut each

other have been gifted to the Petitioner by his father through

this Deed.

The complaint of the Petitioner is the 1st-4th Respondents, who

are, respectively, the Yatiyantota Pradeshiya Sabha, the

Divisional Secretary of Yatiyantota, a Member of Parliament, and

a Member of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council, are

constructing a road across his land, Mahawatta, described in

Plan P1B, without having followed the proper procedure.

The Petitioner had filed a District Court action on the same

cause of action in 2002, i.e. that a road was being forcibly

constructed across his lands, Mahawatta and Madagedarawatta,

which are contiguous lands. After the trial, as seen from the

Judgment marked P3E, the action was dismissed on the merits

and not on technical grounds as alleged by the Petitioner in

paragraph 8 of his written submissions. It is erroneous to say

4

the Petitioners action was dismissed by the District Court for

non-compliance with section 214(1) of the Pradesheeya Sabha

Act. One of the main grounds upon which the Petitioners action

was dismissed by the District Court was the failure on the part

of the Petitioner to prove construction of a new road across his

lands. The appeal filed in the High Court of Civil Appeal was

also dismissed, albeit on the said technical ground.

The Petitioner had thereafter filed a writ application bearing

No.CA/WRIT/257/2015 on the same issue, but it appears the

application was later withdrawn.

The three Counsel appearing for separate Respondents state in

unison that the facts of this matter are in dispute and therefore

this Court has no option but to dismiss the Petitioners

application. There is force in this argument.

The main question appears to me to be the identification of the

disputed road. It is still unclear where exactly this road is. The

learned District Judge in the aforementioned case was also

confronted with the same predicament. The Petitioner has not

identified the disputed part of the road, which he says runs

across his land, by way of a Plan. He alleges the 1st-4th

Respondents are constructing a road on his land depicted in

Plan P1B. But no such road is shown on this Plan although the

Petitioner has tendered several photographs compendiously

marked P12 showing the alleged construction. The Court cannot

assume that what is shown in those photographs is the road

being constructed across the Petitioners land depicted in P1B.

The difficulty relating to the identification of the road is

5

exacerbated by the fact that other villagers in the area have

taken no objection to the widening of any existing road or the

construction of a new road.

As seen from his title Deed marked P1A, the Petitioners entire

extent of land comprises several lands.

The 1st Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha, in its statement of

objections, intentionally or unintentionally, takes up different

positions in identifying the road.

In paragraph 5, for instance, the 1st Respondent admits the road

running over the Petitioners land and tenders the document

marked A to say the Petitioners father gave written consent to

the 1st Respondent to use the road as a Pradeshiya Sabha road.

The Petitioner denies this document and further says, in any

event, according to the said document his father had not given

consent to construct a road across his land.

However, the consent given by this document cannot be in

respect of a land other than the Petitioners land, because the

Petitioners father need not and cannot have given consent in

respect of others lands.

These are disputed questions of fact which cannot be decided by

the writ Court.

Then in paragraph 8 of the statement of objections, the 1st

Respondent seems to be saying the road runs along the

southern boundary of the Petitioners land, Mahawatta, (and not

across the land) and has been in existence since 1986 as a

6

Gamsabha road, and was thereafter widened after 1988 by the

Government.

According to the 1st Respondent, the road in dispute is a

gazetted road, as shown in the Gazette marked X, by the name

of Kandewatta-Meepitikanda road. This Gazette has been

marked by the Petitioner as P6.

Then in paragraph 14, the 1st Respondent says it has not taken

any steps to construct a road over the land of the Petitioner but

the Development Council has taken steps to develop the said

road.

Then in paragraph 18, the 1st Respondent says the 1st

Respondent is entitled to construct and use the aforesaid

gazetted road running along the boundary of Mahawatte.

This clearly shows the facts are in dispute. The identification of

the road is still in question.

Let me now consider what the 2nd Respondent, the Divisional

Secretary, says in his objections.

The 2nd Respondent also seems to be taking up contradictory

positions in his statement of objections.

In paragraphs 7 and 8(a) of the statement of objections, the 2nd

Respondent says the Kandewatte-Meepitigama road runs

alongside the land of the Petitioner.

Then in paragraphs 9 and 10(c), the 2nd Respondent says the

Kandewatte-Meepitigama road runs through the land of the

Petitioner.

7

The 5th-8th Respondents, in paragraphs 6 and 7 of their

statement of objections, state the disputed road, which is 10 feet

wide, has been in existence since 1986 and is bordering the

land owned by the Petitioner. According to the Gazette marked

X/P6, the width of the Kandewatta-Meepitikanda road is 06-02

feet. However, it is not clear whether the name of the disputed

road is Kandewatta-Meepitikanda road.

Then, in paragraph 10, the said Respondents say they did not

construct a new road over the land of the Petitioner but only

developed the existing 10 foot road due to its poor condition.

According to paragraph 13, it is a Pradeshiya Sabha road that

has been gazetted in the said Gazette. But the said Respondents

do not specifically mention the name of the road.

The Petitioner, drawing attention to P14C, says the said gazetted

road does not go through the Petitioners lands.

But, according to P14B, the Wekada-Dummaladeniya

Pradeshiya Sabha road runs through the Petitioners land,

Amuhenaya Liyadda. Amuhenaya Liyadda is a land owned by

the Petitioner as per Deed P1(a). As I said earlier, these are

contiguous lands.

The document P14D refers to another Pradeshiya Sabha road,

namely, Meepitikanda road. This road is also referred to in the

P6 Gazette.

P15 refers to the Galpatha-Godawela-Udapitiya-Dummaladeniya

road.

8

Far from identifying any existing or proposed road in Plan P1B,

the Petitioner does not even, at the very least, state the name of

the road he disputes.

When major facts are in dispute necessitating evidence to be led

to arrive at a correct finding, this Court cannot exercise writ

jurisdiction. However, this is not, in my view, a rigid principle in

judicial review. It does not, for instance, apply to situations

where a losing party purports to project facts as being in dispute

as a defence, nay, sham, whereas in reality it is not so, in order

to thwart justice; nor does it apply to situations where a

deciding authority has come to an erroneous finding of fact on a

manifestly wrong analysis of the evidence.

Unless the disputed road is properly identified, I am unable to

even consider whether the unspecified relief sought by the

Petitioner, i.e. a writ of prohibition preventing the 1st to 4th

Respondents from constructing a roadway over the land claimed

by the Petitioner depicted in Plan P1B without recourse to the due

process of the law can be granted.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner but without costs.
