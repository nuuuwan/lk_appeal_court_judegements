Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiff filed this action in the District Court of Kandy

seeking to partition the land known as Bathalakotuwewatta,

containing in extent two pelas of paddy sowing area, among the

Plaintiff and 1st-7th Defendants. The 10th Defendant is the

contesting party. The 10th Defendant filed several statements of

claim and the last one appears to be the one dated 03.11.1988.

According to this statement of claim, the 10th Defendant is not

claiming undivided rights in Bathalakotuwewatta, the land for

the partition of which the case was filed. The 10th Defendant

claims title to a land known as Illukkatiyewatta.

At the trial, on 23.04.1992, the Plaintiff raised the following

issues.

1. Was the original owner of the land known as

Bathalakotuwewaththa, as described in the schedule to

the plaint, Rankoth Gedara Havadiya Duraya?

2. Have the rights of the said Havadiya Duraya passed to

the Plaintiff and 1st-7th Defendants in the manner

described in paragraphs 3-11 of the plaint?

3. Have the Plaintiff and his predecessors in title acquired

prescriptive rights to the land in suit by having been in

possession for over 10 years?

4. Is the land sought to be partitioned described as Lots

1, 2 and 3 in Plan No.1910 dated 14.01.1981 prepared

by licensed surveyor A.B. Weerasekera?

3

5. If the above issues are answered in favour of the

Plaintiff, is the Plaintiff entitled to a partition decree as

sought in the prayer to the plaint?

On the same day, the 10th Defendant raised five issues, but

withdrew those issues on 09.06.1992 and raised the following

new issues.

8. Is the land inclusive of the waterspout thereon depicted

in Plan No.1910 dated 14.01.1981 prepared by

surveyor Weerasekera, the land known as

Illukkatiyawatta as described in the first schedule to

the amended answer of the 10th Defendant?

9. Is the said land depicted as Lots 1, 2, and 3 in Plan

No.2604 dated 16.08.1986 prepared by surveyor

G.R.G.M. Weerakoon?

10. Is the 10th Defendant entitled to the said land known

as Illukkatiyawatta comprising 5 lahas of paddy sowing

area as described in the second schedule to the

amended answer in the manner averred in his answer?

11. Is the said land described as Lot 3 in Plan No.2704

prepared by surveyor Weerakoon?

12. Has the 10th Defendant enjoyed continuous,

uninterrupted and undisturbed possession of the said

Lot 3 for over 10 years and thereby acquired

prescriptive rights to the land?

4

13. If the above issue Nos. 8-12 are answered in favour of

the 10th Defendant, can the Plaintiff maintain this

action?

14. Was the commission to correct Preliminary Plan

No.1910 issued to surveyor Weerasekera with the

permission of the Court?

15. In any event, did the Plaintiff act in accordance with

section 19(2) of the Partition Law when the second

commission was issued?

16. If the above two issues, Nos. 14 and 15, are answered

against the Plaintiff, can the Plaintiff maintain this

action?

By the said issues, the 10th Defendant takes up the following

positions:

1. What is depicted in Lot 1 of Plan No.1910 dated

14.01.1981 prepared by surveyor A.B. Weerasekera

marked X is not Bathalakotuwewatta but

Illukkatiyewatta.

2. This land is shown as Lots 1-3 in Plan No.2704 dated

16.08.1986 prepared by surveyor G.R.W.M. Weerakoon

marked A. (Nevertheless, a larger extent comprising 5

lots is shown in Plan No.2704).

3. The 10th Defendant acquired prescriptive title to Lot 3

in Plan No.2704. (However, the 10th Defendant does not

say he claims Lots 1 and 2 of the same Plan thereby

5

giving the impression that he has no claim to those two

lots, which is contrary to the position taken by him in

(1) above).

4. The second commission was issued to surveyor

Weerasekera not through the Court (and is therefore

invalid).

At the trial, the Plaintiff and surveyor Weerasekera, who was the

Court Commissioner, gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff.

Then the 1st Defendant gave evidence accepting the Plaintiffs

pedigree. The 10th Defendant, surveyor Weerakoon and an

officer from the Harispattuwa Divisional Secretariat gave

evidence on behalf of the 10th Defendant.

After the trial, the learned District Judge dismissed the

Plaintiffs action. Hence this appeal by the Plaintiff.

It is relevant to note that the trial was concluded on 20.10.1995

and the Judgment was delivered on 22.09.2000, i.e. five years

after the conclusion of the trial. This is entirely unsatisfactory

and cannot be condoned by any stretch of the imagination.

In Kulatunga v. Samarasinghe,1 this Court held:

A [partition] judgment delivered two years and four months

after the tender of written submissions cannot stand. The

case depended on the oral testimonies of witnesses. The

impression created by the witnesses on the judge is bound

to have faded away after such a long delay. The learned

1 [1990] 1 Sri LR 244.

6

judge was bound to have lost the advantage of the

impressions created by the witnesses whom he saw and

heard and his recollections of the fine points in the case

would have faded from his memory by the time he comes to

write the judgment.

Be that as it may, let me now consider on what grounds the

learned District Judge dismissed the Plaintiffs action.

The learned District Judge dismissed the Plaintiffs action on the

basis that in view of the issues raised by the 10th Defendant,

the Plaintiff failed to depict the land to be partitioned in the

Preliminary Plan.

According to the plaint, the extent of land to be partitioned is

two pelas of paddy sowing area, which is equivalent to 1 acre.

The Court Commissioner, Weerasekera, first prepared Plan

No.1910 dated 14.01.1981, depicting a land in extent of acre

and 22 perches. Thereafter, as seen from journal entry No.35,

the Attorney-at-Law for the Plaintiff, with notice to the Attorney-

at-Law for the 10th Defendant, moved Court to reissue the

commission to Weerasekera to show the entire land of 1 acre as

stated in the commission. This application was allowed and, as

seen from journal entry No.55, the commission was reissued to

Weerasekera. Upon receipt of the commission, the Court

Commissioner asked for Plan No.1910, which had already been

sent to the Court, in order for him to show the larger land

thereon, and the learned District Judge, as seen from journal

entry No.57, ordered the said Plan to be sent to the Court

7

Commissioner. The amended Plan No.1910 was sent to the

Court thereafter vide journal entry No.61.

Following the (misleading) written submission of the 10th

Defendant filed after the conclusion of the trial, the learned

District Judge in the Judgment says that the removal of the first

Plan (depicting acre and 22 perches) from the case record

without the authority of the Court, and the introduction of a

second Plan (depicting 1 acre 1 rood and 22 perches) instead is

wrongful. This is completely incorrect. The first Plan was

removed and the second (amended) Plan was prepared by Order

of the Court. There is no truth to the statement that the first

Plan was illegally removed and a new Plan was introduced. The

amendment was done on the first Plan itself.

The learned District Judge says a portion of a different land

(probably referring to Illukkatiyewatta claimed by the 10th

Defendant) is shown in the second Plan, and, according to the

learned District Judge, this is not correct.

If the learned District Judge thinks that portions of different

lands have been included in the Preliminary Plan, what he

should do is not dismiss the partition action in toto, but exclude

the portions of other lands and partition the land in respect of

which the action was filed among the rightful owners in terms of

the law.

In the Judgment, the learned District Judge does not analyse

the evidence led at the trial at all. Nor does he answer any of the

issues. Instead, he refers to the schedules of the Deeds marked

P1 and P2 to say that Bathalakotuwewatta comprises 1 pela of

8

paddy sowing area. He further says, it is for the first time in the

Deed marked P3 that the land is described as having 2 pelas in

extent. This analysis is not correct. The Deed P1 was executed

in 1974 and P2 in 1943. But P3 was executed in 1938, prior to

both P1 and P2. Thereafter, in all subsequent Deeds,

Bathalakotuwewatta is described as a land of 2 pelas.

On the other hand, even if the learned District Judge thought

Bathalakotuwewatta comprises 1 pela and not 2 pelas, he could

have confined the land to Lot 1 of the Preliminary Plan and

partitioned the same among the co-owners, subject to the claim

of the 10th Respondent.

The 10th Respondent had on his own caused Plan No.2704 to be

prepared and marked it as A at the trial. The learned District

Judge has referred to this Plan in the Judgment and appears to

have taken the view that a portion of Illukkatiyewatta is

included in Preliminary Plan No.1910. This is unacceptable.

According to section 18(3) of the Partition Law, if the Court or a

party is not satisfied with the Preliminary Plan, steps can be

taken to issue a commission to the Surveyor-General to prepare

a fresh Plan; but there is no provision in the Partition Law to

issue a commission to another surveyor to prepare an

alternative Preliminary Plan. (Fernando v. Perera,2 Tudor v.

Lalitha3) However, in the instant case, no commission was

issued by the Court for the preparation of an alternative Plan.

The Court can, upon the application of the Plaintiff or ex mero

motu, give the Court Commissioner further instructions to

submit to the Court a complete Plan depicting the land to be

partitioned. These instructions can be given with the

commission, during the course of the execution of the

commission, or after the Plan is sent to the Court upon

execution of the commission. (Uberis v. Jayawardene,4 Brampy

Appuhamy v. Menis Appuhamy5)

If the 10th Defendant was dissatisfied with Preliminary Plan

No.1910, what he should have done was cause another

commission to be issued to the same Court Commissioner to

show the encroachment by the Plaintiff or any other Defendant

on his land, namely Illukkatiyewatta, and seek the exclusion of

those parts from the Preliminary Plan or the land to be

partitioned. This was not done.

Any other Plan shall be superimposed on the Preliminary Plan

and not vice versa. In any event, the Preliminary Plan has not

been superimposed on Plan No.2704 tendered by the 10th

Defendant either.

The learned District Judge could not have relied on Plan

No.2704 to dismiss the Plaintiffs action.

The learned District Judge further says in the impugned

Judgment that lis pendens had not been registered when the

larger land was shown in the amended Preliminary Plan. This is

also an erroneous finding. As seen from page 438 of the Appeal

4 (1959) 62 NLR 217. 5 (1958) 60 NLR 337.

10

Brief, lis pendens was registered for the land of about 2 pelas in

extent as described in the schedule to the plaint.

The learned District Judge dismissed the Plaintiffs action on an

erroneous basis without analysing the evidence five years after

the trial was concluded, as he may have thought this was the

most convenient way to dispose of the action.

This Court sitting on appeal cannot play the role of the trial

Judge and analyse the evidence as the learned District Judge

ought to have done and deliver the Judgment on the merits.

However, it would be unconscionable to order trial de novo as

the case was filed in the District Court more than 42 years ago

to be exact on 04.01.1980.

I set aside the Judgment of the District Court and direct the

incumbent learned District Judge of Kandy to deliver the

Judgment afresh on the evidence led at the trial according to

law.

The appeal of the Plaintiff is allowed. No costs.
