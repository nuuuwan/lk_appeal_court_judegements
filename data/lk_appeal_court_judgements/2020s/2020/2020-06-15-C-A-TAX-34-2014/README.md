The Appellant is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Sri Lanka and its

principal business activity is the manufacture of steel moulds, injection moulded plastic and

rubber items for export.

The Appellant filed its income tax returns for the years of assessment 2006/2007 and

2007/2008 claiming a deduction for unrealised foreign exchange losses in a sum of Rs.

44,741,774/= and Rs. 36,962,328/= respectively.

The Assessor rejected the returns and issued fresh assessments on the Appellant disallowing

the foreign exchange loss and the Appellant appealed to the Respondent who confirmed the

assessments made by the Assessor.

The Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC) which dismissed the appeal and

confirmed the determination of the Respondent.

Aggrieved by the determination of the TAC, the Appellant requested the TAC to state a case for

the opinion of this Court and the Case Stated forwarded contains the following questions of

law:

(1) Has the TAC erred in law in concluding that the foreign exchange losses incurred by the

Appellant for the years of assessment 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 was capital

expenditure in terms of section 26(l)(h) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006?

(2) Whether the foreign exchange losses incurred by the Appellant for the years of

assessment 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 are an outgoing or expense which is deductible

for income tax purposes in terms of section 25(1) and/or any other provision of the

Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006?

Before proceeding to examine these two questions in detail, it is apposite to state that sections

25 and 26 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended have to be read together as

both provisions apply to the deductibility from profits or income. While section 25 specifies the

permissible deductions, section 26 expressly disallows certain deductions, which if not so

prohibited, would be allowable deductions.

Page 2 of 8

Hence one must first ascertain whether what is sought to be deducted is permissible in terms of

section 25 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended. If it is so, still the deduction

may be prohibited in terms of section 26 of Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended.

Thus the learned counsel for the Appellant conceded during the argument that both the

questions must be answered in favour of the Appellant for it to succeed.

I will therefore first examine question 2 raised on the application of section 25 of the Inland

Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended and then proceed to examine question 2 based on the

application of section 26 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended.

Outgoing or Expense

Section 25(1) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended reads:

"25(1). Subject to the provisions of subsection 2 ond 4, there shall be deducted

for the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of any person from

any source, 011 outgoing and expenses incurred by such person in the

production thereof .. "

Section 25(1) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 is similar to section 9(1) of the Income

Tax Ordinance. Basnayake c.J. having considered this provision opined in Hayleys & Co. Ltd. v.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (65 N.l.R. 174 at 175) held that:

"The word "outgoings" means what goes out and is a word of wide import. It is the

opposite of the equally wide expression "income" which means what comes in. In the

context the word "expenses" is limited by the words "incurred by such person in the

production thereof" while the words "outgoings" is not so limited. The two words are

designed to express two different concepts one of wider import than the other. All

outgoings are not expenses incurred in the production of the profits or income; but all

expenses incurred in the production of the profits or income are outgoings ... "

It is the Appellant's position that the foreign exchange losses were directly connected with the

business and therefore was an expense incurred in the production of the Appellant [paragraph

26 of written submissions filed on 16.11.2018).

Page 3 of 8

The meaning of the phrase "incurred in the production of the income" was explained by

Watermeyer AJP in Port Elizabeth Electric Tromways Company Ltd., v. ClF [(1936) CPD 241, 8

S.A.T.c. 13J as:

" ... the purpose of the act entailing expenditure must be looked to. If it is performed for

the purpose of earning income, then the expenditure attendant upon it is deductible ... "

Clearly, the words expenses incurred by such person in the production thereof to me means

expenses actually expended and not a notional allocation.

The issue is put beyond any doubt when the relevant portion of the Sinhala version of section

25(1) ofthe Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended is considered. It reads:

25 . ( J) (2) D= G:l> (4) 0= c<:ltxmrlt>l0c EX35D:~ <..:>urn 0, ""<!) groEX..:>Bzrl ~<:!5&= ~ ""'l.~clm~<3l' c:>ro """,,$ <f'>y>c..:l e.cdc:x.:> B8G~ "",lb"" COX'.,<fXl <::).",,::;) G:lt.~ <;:t <r-(~<!>El, d c= =$ ~ ~ d fi>7=.:rnm::> E3Bzrl <;;6= e<; B..:>~ BOc::x><'!l = ~~ <rR ",,6~ L"'l@o H~ w--

This is the authoritative version in terms of Article 23(1) of the Constitution.

There is no dispute between the parties that the exchange losses in issue are unrealised

exchange losses [paragraph 2 of letter dated 24.11.2010 sent by the authorised representative

of the Appellant PWC to the Board of ReviewJ. The Appellant is bound by an admission of fact

made by its authorised representative. Hence they are not expenses incurred by the Appellant

in the production thereof within the meaning of section 25(1) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10

of 2006 as amended.

The learned counsel for the Appellant relied on the Sri Lanka Financial Accounting Standards -

2017 where at paragraphs 4.33 and 4.35 it is stated that the definition of expenses

encompasses unrealised losses and it includes losses for example arising from the effects of

increasing the rate of exchange for foreign currency borrowings of an entity.

The purpose of accounting is usually to provide information to interested parties relevant to

stewardship, control and decision-making. The requirements of a tax system can be quite

Page 4 of 8

different. The profits and income shown in the accounts prepared in accordance with

accounting standards differ from profits and income computed in accordance with the

provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended.

In fact, the Supreme Court in Rodrigo v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [(2002) 1

SrLL.R. 384 at 387J held that to arrive at the taxa ble income consideration should be given only

to the permissible deductions provided by the Act and the Court cannot take into consideration

any other means of computing the deductible amounts. In doing so, it quoted with approval the

decision in Sub Nigel Ltd., v. ClR [(1948) 4 SA 580, 15 S.A.T.c. 381J where Centilivers c.J. held

that the Court is not concerned with deductions which may be considered proper from an

accountant's point of view or from the point of view of a prudent trader, but merely with the

deductions which are permissible according to the language of the Act.

I wish to add in passing that this is the approach taken by other jurisdictions as well.

In Thor Power Tools Company v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue [58L Ed. 2d.785 at 802

(1979)J the US Supreme Court stated:

"The primary goal of financial accounting is to provide useful information to

management, shareholders, creditors, and others properly interested; the major

responsibility of the accountant is to protect these parties from being misled. The

primary goal of the income tax system, in contrast, is the equitable collection of

revenue; the major responsibility of the Internal Revenue Service is to protect the public

fisc. Consistently with its goals and responsibilities, financial accounting has as its

foundation the principle of conservatism, with its corollary that 'possible errors in

measurement [shouldJ be in the direction of understatement rather than overstatement

of net income and net assets'. In view of the Treasury's markedly different goals and

responsibilities, understatement of income is not destined to be its guiding light. Given

this diversity, even contrariety of objectives, any presumptive equivalency between tax

and financial accounting would be unacceptable".

For the foregoing reasons the answer to question no. 2 should be in the negative.

Capital ar Revenue Expenditure

26(1)(h) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 reads:

"(1) For the purpose of ascertaining the profits or income of any person from any

source, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of

(h) any expenditure of a capital nature or any loss of capital incurred by such

person" (Emphasis added)

As pointed out earlier, the word incurred means expenses actually expended and not a notional

allocation as in the case of the Appellant.

The learned counsel for the Appellant referred to the decision in Atherton v. British Insulated

Helsby Cables [10 TC 155] and in particular to the statement of Viscount Cave who stated:

" ... When expenditure is made, not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into

existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of the trade, I think that

there is very good reasons (in the absence of special circumstances leading to an

opposite conclusion) for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to

revenue but to capital." (Emphasis added)

It was further submitted that the Financial Statements of the Appellant for 2007 are clearly

indicative that the Appellant was in serious financial difficulty during 2006/2007 and 2007/2008

and that the parent company B-L GmbH was providing temporary funding to keep the Appellant

afloat and in these circumstances, the foreign exchange losses arising from the depreciation of

the Rupee vs the Euro with respect to temporary funding cannot in any way be considered as

"expenditure made ... with a view to brining inta existence an asset or an advantage for the

enduring benefit afthe trade" as set out in the dicta of Viscount Cave.

Yet, the dicta itself refers to expenditure made and not unrealised exchange losses as in the

case of the Appellant. In this context, the decision in Pattison (Inspector of Taxes) v. Marine

Midland Ltd. [(1984) A.C. 362 (HL)] is instructive.

Page 6 of 8

There a subsidiary of a US bank in the UK matched its foreign currency obligations with foreign

currency assets. The subsidiary borrowed a substantial amount of money from its parent

company which it used to make loans in US dollars to its customers without converting the sum

into sterling. The subsidiary regarded the loan from its parent company as a US dollar liability

which it matched with US dollar assets. The subsidiary repaid the loan to its parent company,

making use of US dollars which the subsidiary had.

During the period from its inception of the loan up to the date of repayment, the value of the

US dollar against the sterling appreciated substantially, and the Commissioner in the UK sought

to tax the book gain and disregard the equivalent book loss. The House of Lords rejected the

Commissioners contention, and accepted the taxpayer's position that only profits realized

should be converted to sterling amounts, as the Commissioner's position was predicated on a

conversion of the principal sums into sterling amounts, without which the amount paid in US

dollars would equal the amount borrowed and there would be no profit or loss to report in the

company's tax return.

This decision supports the proposition that unrealised exchange loss due to currency

conversion has no effect on the income and profit of an entity for income tax purposes.

Nonetheless, even on the question of capital or revenue transaction, whether loans were

revenue transactions or accretions to capita l is one of fact [Beauchamp (Inspector oj Taxes) v.

F.W. Woolworth pic (1988) Simon's Tax Cases 714].

In this context, it is observed that the Appellant has not charged the alleged foreign exchange

loss to the profit and loss account. As the TAC correctly pointed out this shows that the

Appellant regarded it as a capital expenditure in terms of section 26(1)(h) of the Inland Revenue

Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended.

For the foregoing reasons the answer to question no. 1 should be in the negative.

Page 7 of8

For all the foregoing reasons, Court answers the questions of law as follows:

(1) Has the TAC erred in law in concluding that the foreign exchange losses incurred by the

Appellant for the years of assessment 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 was capital

expenditure in terms of section 26(1)(h) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006? No.

(2) Whether the foreign exchange losses incurred by the Appellant for the years of

assessment 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 are an outgoing or expense which is deductible

for income tax purposes in terms of section 25(1) and/or any other provision of the

Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006? No.

For the reasons aforesaid, Court confirms the Determination of the TAC.

The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment to the TAC.
