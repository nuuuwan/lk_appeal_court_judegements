Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

This appeal has been filed in terms of Section 8(6) of the Sri Lanka Institute of

Architects Law, No.1 of 1976, as amended, seeking inter alia the following

relief:

a. To set aside the Disciplinary Order dated 1th February 2014, marked

'P1G', imposed on the Appellant and declare that it is not valid, has no

force in law and is erroneous in fact and law.

b. To set aside the charge sheet dated 11th November 2011 and the

Disciplinary Report placed before the Council of the Respondent on 29th

January 2014 and declare that they are not valid and have no force in

law.l

c. To direct the Council of the Respondent to commence an investigation on

the complaint of the Appellant.

The facts of this appeal very briefly are as follows:

The Respondent, the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects has been established by

the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects Law, No.1 of 1976, as amended (the Act).

The Appellant is a Chartered Architect and has been a member of the

Respondent since 1999. The laws and regulations in respect of the members of

the Respondent are stipulated in the Act and the Regulations published in

1 In term s of Section 5(1) of the Act, The administration and management of the affairs of the Institute shall be vested in a Council which shall perform the fun ctions and duties and may exercise the powers of the Institute under this Law.'

2

Extraordinary Gazette No. 1416/10 dated 25th October 2005 (the Regulations).

A copy of the said Regulations has been annexed to the petition marked 'Pl'.

The general objects of the Respondent have been set out in Section 3 of the

Act, and include the following objects which are relevant to the issue that

culminated in this appeal:

(a) To promote and advance the study, practice and application of, and

research in, architecture;

(b) To organise, supervise and control the admission and the professional

education and training of persons desiring to qualify as architects;

(c) To prescribe or approve courses of study for the qualifying examinations

for membership of the Institute, and to conduct or provide for the

conduct of such courses and examinations.

Regulation 7.7 of 'Pl' provides for the appointment of the Boards specified

therein. In terms of Regulation 7.7.1, the Board of Architectural Education

(BAE) has been established to assist, advise and control the education of

students in Architecture, the conduct of examinations and all matters

connected therewith. Similarly, in terms of Regulation 7.7.4, the Board of

Management (BaM) has been established to assist, advice, control, guide and

manage any event connected with the conducting of classes and lectures in

relation to Architectural education or any other course or any institution

formed under the Respondent for related activity.

3

Sections 8B - 8E of the Act provides for the qualifications that are required for

a person to be registered as a Chartered Architect, Architect or as an

Architectural Licentiate. The Appellant states that by an advertisement

published in the Daily News of 21st November 2009, marked 'P2', the Secretary

of the Board of Architectural Education had called for applications for

registration of candidates to follow a part time lecture series leading to the

qualifying examination for Architectural Licentiates. A pass in the said

qualifying examination was a pre-requisite to apply for registration as an

Architectural Licentiate. The Appellant states that Section 8E(c) of the Act too

provides that the said Architectural Licentiate Examinations must be

conducted by the Council and not a private institution.

The Appellant states that in May 2010, it was brought to his attention that a

third party entity was to commence the lecture course leading to the Licentiate

Examination in Architecture, in contravention of Regulations 7.7.1 and 7.7.4 of

the Regulations and Section 8E(c) of the Act. The Appellant states that this was

a deviation from the above practice of the Respondent conducting the

necessary lectures, as reflected by 'P2'.

Aggrieved by the alleged violation of the provisions of the Regulations and the

Act by the Respondent, namely whether the Respondent has the authority to

permit a lecture course leading to the Licentiate Examination in Architecture to

be conducted by a third party, the Appellant, by letter dated 24th May 2010

marked 'P3', brought the matter to the attention of the Secretary of the

Respondent. 'P3' had been copied to the members of the Council, as well as

the general membership of the Respondent. While emphasising on the legal

implications of delegating the above duty to a third party, the Appellant

4

requested that the lectures proposed to be conducted by the third-party

Company be cancelled.

Having received no response to the abovementioned letter 'P3', the Appellant

wrote another letter to the Respondent, dated 21't June 2010, marked 'P4'. In

the said letter, the Appellant referred to by name, the Secretary of the Board

of Architectural Education and the Chief Executive Officer of the third party

entity, and alleged that the Board of Architectural Education has already

started negotiations with the said private institution in order to conduct the

said Licentiate Examinations. The letter 'P4' contains the following statement

about the aforementioned two persons:

"It is no doubt to state that as you have failed to acknowledge the letter

and to rectify the irregular and unlawful operation with immediate effect

by forwarding for a report and thereby holding the existing operations; I

believe these two persons are taking the upper hand in this unlawful and

irregular operation."

Bya further letter dated 26th July 2010, marked 'PS', the Appellant accused the

Respondent of attempting to 'implement the irregular and unlawful operation

of conducting Architectural Licentiate Courses by a complete outside entity

without any accreditation or validation or without any license to conduct

architectural exams or to conduct courses in Architecture in Sri Lanka as per the

Act.' The Appellant had once again referred to the fact that the Secretary of

the Board of Architectural Education and the Chief Executive Officer of the

third party entity are engaged in discussions to commence the said course and

called for an investigation into their alleged misconduct, which had quite

5

correctly been turned down by the Respondent on the basis that there was no

material to initiate an investigation against the said Architects.

On 4 th August 2010, the Respondent had received a letter from the said

Secretary, Board of Architectural Education, stating that the Appellant had

copied the aforementioned two letters 'P4' and 'PS' to the general

membership of the Respondent and thereby caused injury to his reputation,

and inquiring whether the Respondent would initiate an inquiry against the

Appellant.

The Respondent did not reply the concerns raised by the Appellant in his three

letters marked 'P3', 'P4' and 'PS'. Instead the Chairman of the Investigation

Committee of the Respondent, through letter dated 18th August 2010, marked

'PS', had informed the Appellant of the aforementioned request for an

investigation and requested the Appellant to submit his response, which was

duly complied with by the Appellant.

In his response to 'PS', the Appellant had stated that he called for an inquiry

against the Secretary of the Board of Architectural Education 'not on a private

matter, but to protect (the Respondent) from the commercial interests that are

overshadowing the Institute and its professional conduction, which is an

institutional matter anyway. Thereby, I believe the General Membership

deserve the right to know all such operations as well'. The Appellant had

requested that the letter calling for an inquiry against him also be shared

among the membership of the Respondent, so that the membership has an

opportunity of deciding for themselves.

6

By a further letter dated 18th October 2010, marked 'P12', the Appellant had

stated that he was not trying to discredit the profession but rather to keep

members of the profession informed of the alleged irregularities that were

taking place. The Appellant had reiterated that he has not maliciously or

unfairly criticised or attempted to discredit any person except the submission

of relevant facts.

The Report of the Investigation Committee dated 8th December 20102 states as

follows:

"The Committee was of the view that the letters under reference by

Architect Nalaka Jayaweera are replete with instances and references

where he has made unfounded criticism against Members and the Council.

The right to criticism does not entitle a Member to make defamatory

statements against another which could tantamount to disrepute. Further,

in several instances Architect Nalaka Jayaweera has made allegations by

identifying Members of SLiA by name, when they were only carrying out

duties on voluntary and honorary capacity as either Chairman,

Secretary, or as a Member of a Board or a Committee. By making such

allegations public by email distribution there is a valid cose of bringing

disrepute and damage to the reputation of such members.

Having considered all aspects of the Investigation, the Committee

unanimously agreed that,

2 This report had been produced before the Disciplinary Committee.

7

I. There is prima facie evidence of violation of Clause 5.3.3 Principle

Three, sub clause (2)(c) and (d) of the Regulations by Architect

Nalaka Jayaweera; and

ii. That such violation is of grave nature."

The Respondent had thereafter referred the matter to the Disciplinary

Committee which had issued the Appellant with the charge sheet annexed to

the letter marked 'P17'.

Following a lengthy inquiry, the Respondent, by letter dated 1 t h February

2014, informed the Appellant that the final report and recommendations of

the Disciplinary Committee had been placed before the Council of the

Respondent and that the Appellant has been found guilty of Charge Nos. 3 and

4. Acting in terms of Section 8(3) of the Act, the Council had reprimanded the

Appellant as a punishment for the said professional misconduct.

3

Dissatisfied with the said decision, the Appellant invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court, seeking the abovementioned relief.

In his written submissions, the learned Counsel for the Appellant has raised

issue with three matters, which this Court shall now consider.

3 Section 8(3) of the Act reads as follows: "The Council shall disenrol any member who in its opinion has been guilty of professional miscondu ct: Provided, however, that th e Council may, in lieu of disenrollment, reprim and such member or suspend him from membership for such period not exceeding one year as the

Council may consider just and equitable in all the circumstances; and provided, further that the Council may in its discretion re-admit such person if in its opinion he has redeemed his character and is fit to practice the

profession of an architect."

8

The first submission is with regard to the procedure that was followed and the

nature of the inquiry that was held against the Appellant. The procedure for

conducting disciplinary inquiries is set out in Section 8(4) and (4A) of the Act,

and Regulation 9 of 'PI'. Accordingly, when a complaint is received, the

Procedures Committee or the Council shall examine the complaint and if it is

found that the material warrants further investigation, refer the matter to the

Investigation Committee

4 The Investigation Committee must conduct an

investigation as provided in Regulation 9.1 and submit a Confidential Report

containing inter alia its findings and other relevant information to the Councils.

This Court, having considered the material placed before it, is of the view that

the provisions in Regulation 9.1 have been adhered to by the Investigations

Committee.

On receipt of the Confidential Report, the Council is required to study the

proceedings and arrive at a decision. Regulation 9.2 (3) states that where the

Council is of the view that further action is warranted, it shall forward the

matter to the Disciplinary Committee.

Regulation 9.3 contains the procedure to be adopted by the Disciplinary

Committee. The first step is for the Disciplinary Committee to issue a Charge

Sheet, which has been duly complied with. This Court must observe that the

principles of a fair hearing have been adhered to by the Disciplinary

Committee and that the Appellant has been afforded every opportunity of

presenting his defence, including the right of representation by an Attorney-at-

Law. In these circumstances, this Court does not see any merit in the first

submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant.

' Regulation 9 (4). ' Regulation 9.1 (5).

9

The next submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant was that a formal

complaint is required to trigger the disciplinary procedure set out in 'Pl'. He

submitted that the Secretary, Board of Architectural Education, during his

evidence before the Disciplinary Committee had admitted that he did not

make a specific complaint against the Appellant but only inquired what steps

the Council could take against the Appellant. 6 In these circumstances, it was

the submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that disciplinary

proceedings could not have been instituted against the Appellant.

Regulation 9 of 'Pl' deals with the submission of a complaint to the

Respondent, and the relevant paragraphs of Regulation 9 are re-produced

below:

"(1) In the event of a breach of the Regulations by a Member, Chartered

Architect, Architect, Architectural Licentiate or a Practice, the

Institute may be informed by the following persons or institutions:

(a) By the Council itself or its Standing Committees.

(b) Any Board or its Standing Committees.

(c) A Council Member.

(d) Member of the Institute, Chartered Architect, Architect, Architectural Licentiate.

(e) Member of the Public.

(f) Any private or public body corporate or non-incorporate.

6 Vide proceedings of 18" September 2012.

10

(2) On receipt of such information or complaint, Institute shall adhere to

the procedure hereinafter set out, whether the informer or

complainant is identifiable or non-identifiable."

The learned Counsel for the Respondent very correctly submitted that the

above provisions as well as Regulation 9 (3) - (8) of 'Pl' makes it abundantly

clear that the Respondent may act on information received, or on a complaint.

This Court is in agreement with the said submission of the learned Counsel for

the Respondent. This Court is therefore of the view that a formal complaint is

not required for the Respondent to initiate disciplinary proceedings against a

Chartered Architect, Architect or an Architectural Licentiate. In any event, it is

clear from the letter sent by the Secretary, Board of Architectural Education

that he was aggrieved by the fact that the Appellant had circulated the letters

'P4' and 'PS' among the general membership. His inquiry as to what action the

Respondent intends to take, is a clear indication that he wanted the

Respondent to act on his letter. In the said circumstances, this Court does not

see any merit in the second submission of the learned Counsel for the

Appellant.

The third submission of the learned Counsel for the Appellant was that the

members of the Disciplinary Committee had failed to evaluate the evidence

that was led before them in the context of the charges framed against the

Appellant, and that the members of the Disciplinary Committee failed to

consider the material that was placed before them in arriving at their

conclusion.

II

Regulation 5 of 'P1' contains the Code of Professional Conduct for the

members of the Respondent. Regulation 5.1(1} sets out that, 'The objective of

this Code of Professional Conduct shall be to maintain and promote the

standards of professional conduct or discipline, required of members of the

Institute, Chartered Architects, Architects, Architectural Licentiates and

Practices in the interest of the Members of the Institute and the Public.'

The Code contains three Principles which the members of the Respondent shall

follow and comply with at all times. The Appellant has been charged with

contravening Principle Three, which is contained in Regulation 5.3.3, re-

produced below:

"(1) A member of the Institute, a Chartered Architect, Architect, an

Architectural Licentiate or a Practice shall undertake in every

circumstance to conduct in a manner, which respects the legitimate

rights and interests of others.

(2) To uphold the Principle set out in 5.3.3 (1), a Member of the Institute,

a Chartered Architect, an Architect, an Architectural Licentiate and

Practice shall-

(a) Not offer any discount, commISSIOn, gratification or other

inducement for the introduction of clients and for procurement

of any assignment;

(b) When appointed as a competition assessor, not subsequently

act in any other capacity for the work;

12

(c) Not maliciously or unfairly criticise or attempt to discredit

another Member of the Institute, a Chartered Architect,

Architect, an Architectural Licentiate or a Practice or the works

carried out by the Practices.

(d) Respect and maintain confidentiality in any matter involving

breaches, either alleged or proven of these Regulations or of the

standard of professional performance of a Chartered Architect,

an Architect, an Architectural Licentiate or a Practice."

The Charge Sheet contained the following four charges:

1. By sending letter dated 21st June 2010 ('P4'), addressed to the Hony

Secretary, containing malicious material and/or unfair criticism of

Architect XX (i.e. the Secretary, Board of Architectural Education), and

copying the same to some Members simultaneously, you have acted

maliciously and/or unfairly criticised and/or attempted to discredit the

said Architect XX, also a member of the Institute and thereby you have

violated Clause 5.3.3 (2) (c) read with Clause 5.1 of the Regulations made

under Sri Lanka Institute of Architects Law, No.1 of 1976 (as amended)

and are therefore liable to be subject to disciplinary action in terms of

Section 8 of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects Law, No.1 of 1976 (as

amended);

2. By sending a letter addressed to the Hony Secretary dated 26th July 2010

('PS') and copying the same letter to some Members simultaneously, you

have acted maliciously and/or unfairly criticised and/or attempted to

discredit the said Architect XX (i.e. the Secretary, Board of Architectural

13

Education), also a member of the Institute and thereby you have violated

Clause 5.3.3 (2) (c) read with Clause 5.1 of the Regulations made under Sri

Lanka Institute of Architects Law, No. 1 of 1976 (as amended) are

therefore liable to be subject to disciplinary action in terms of Section 8 of

the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects Law, No.1 of 1976 (as amended);

3. By sending letter dated 21st June 2010 ('P4'), complaining inter alia of the

conduct of Architect XX addressed to the Hony Secretary and copying the

same to some members simultaneously, you have failed to maintain

confidentiality as required by the Regulations in any matters referred to in

the above letters involving breaches either alleged or proven of the

Regulations and/or of the Standards of Professional Performance of

Architect XX and thereby violated Clause 5.3.3 (2) (d) read with Clause 5.1

of the Regulations made under Sri Lanka Institute of Architects Law, No.1

of 1976 (as amended) are therefore liable to be subject to disciplinary

action in terms of Section 8 of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects Law,

No.1 of 1976 (as amended);

4. By sending letter dated 26th June 2010 ('PS'), complaining inter alia of the

conduct of Architect XX addressed to the Hony Secretary and copying the

same to some members Simultaneously, you have failed to maintain

confidentiality as required by the Regulations in any matters referred to in

the above letters involving breaches either alleged or proven of the

Regulations and/or of the Standards of Professional Performance of

Architect XX and thereby violated Clause 5.3.3 (2) (c) read with Clause 5.1

of the Regulations made under Sri Lanka Institute of Architects Law, No.1

of 1976 (as amended) are therefore liable to be subject to disciplinary

14

action in terms of Section 8 of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects Law,

No.1 of 1976 (as amended);

This Court must observe that the reference to 'Clause 5.3.3 (2)(c)' in Charge

NO.4 is incorrect and that the correct reference should have been to 'Clause

5.3.3 (2)(d)'. Although this matter had been raised at the inquiry, steps had not

been taken to amend the charge.

7

In their report dated 8th January 2014, the members of the Disciplinary

Committee had stated that to find the Appellant guilty under Regulation

5.3.3(2)(c), it is a requirement that the prosecution prove that the alleged act

by the Appellant was carried out maliciously or unfairly. The Disciplinary

Committee had gone on to hold that the prosecution has failed to meet this

threshold, and therefore the Appellant had been found not guilty of Charge

Nos. 1 and 2. This finding of the Disciplinary Committee that the Appellant did

not act maliciously is significant in view of the position taken up by the

Appellant, which would be discussed later. The Disciplinary Committee had

however found the Appellant guilty of Charge Nos. 3 and 4, in spite of the

aforementioned error in Charge No. 4.

This Court therefore has to only consider whether the findings of the

Disciplinary Committee with regard to Charge Nos. 3 and 4 are correct.

A close examination of Regulation 5.3.3(2)(d) would reveal that the obligation

to maintain confidentiality must be read together with Regulation 5.3.3 (1) and

must arise with regard to either of the following:

7 Vid e proceedings of 5th December 2012.

15

(a) Any matter involving a breach, either alleged or proven, of the

Regulations 'Pl';

(b) Any matter involving the standard of professional performance of a

Chartered Architect, an Architect, an Architectural Licentiate or a

Practice.

There are three matters that this Court must observe at this stage, which

demonstrates that Charge Nos. 3 and 4 were not specific. The first is that the

said charges do not specify whether the failure to maintain confidentiality was

with regard to (a) or (b) above, but leaves it open by using the words, 'and/or'.

The second is that the charges do not contain any specific reference to a

particular Regulation of 'Pl', which is said to have been breached by the

Secretary, Board of Architectural Education. This position was in fact suggested

to the Secretary, Board of Architectural Education during cross examination,

but he failed to refer to any particular regulation in 'Pl' that the Appellant is

complaining that he has breached, except to state that the Appellant had no

right to circulate the letters among the general membership of the

Respondent. The third is with regard to Regulation 6.S of 'Pl' which contain

the Standard of Professional Performance that must be maintained by a

Chartered Architect, an Architect, an Architectural Licentiate or a Practice. This

Court has examined the provisions of Regulation 6.S and observes that it

applies to the professional services that are offered by a Chartered Architect,

an Architect, an Architectural Licentiate or a Practice, whereas the allegation

that the Appellant had made was not with regard to professional services that

16

had been carried out or performed by the Secretary, Board of Architectural

Education.

This Court has examined the evidence of the Secretary, Board of Architectural

Education and the evidence of the Appellant. The Appellant does not deny that

he sent the letters marked 'P4' and 'PS' to the Respondent. The names of the

persons who have been copied the said letters have been set out at the

bottom thereof and includes the members of the Council, and the general

membership of the Respondent. During his evidence, the Appellant did try to

say that the letters were not circulated among the membership, but this

position of the Appellant does not appear to be tenable, and in fact runs

contrary to his argument that he was raising this issue for the benefit of the

entire membership.

The position of the Appellant before the Disciplinary Committee was that the

letters 'P4' and 'PS', the contents of which were the subject matter of the

charges against him, did not contain anything about the architectural practice

of the said Secretary, Board of Architectural Education and that the complaint

of the Appellant did not relate to the personal capacity of the said member but

related to the failure on the part of the members of the Board of Architectural

Education to look into the alleged irregularities, in their official capacity.

The Appellant submitted further that 'P4' and 'PS' only relates to a matter

affecting the Architectural Profession in general and the actions/inactions of

the Board of Architectural Education and/or the Respondent in relation to one

particular incident in their official capacity as office bearers of the Board of

Architectural Education. It was therefore the position of the Appellant that he

17

was under a duty to keep the members of the Institute informed as it was in

relation to the Architectural Profession and Education and not in relation to

the architectural practice of the members of the Board of Architectural

Education.

The position taken up by the Appellant before the Disciplinary Committee can

be summarised as follows:

8

(a) He did not make any personal allegations against the said Secretary,

Board of Architectural Education;

(b) The references to the said Architect in 'P4' and 'PS' were with regard to

acts carried out in his capacity as the Secretary, Board of Architectural

Education;

(c) The allegations that he made were purely with regard to the steps that

the said Architect had taken in his capacity as Secretary, Board of

Architectural Education, and with regard to the conducting of the lecture

courses, and not with regard to any breach of professional duties or

obligations as an Architect.

As observed earlier, the grievance of the Appellant - namely that the duty to

conduct courses leading to the Architectural Licentiate is with the Respondent,

and that it cannot be given to a third party - was with the Respondent and its

Boards. The grievance was not directed at the persons holding office at the

Board of Architectural Education. This is clearly borne out by the letter dated

24th May 2010 marked 'P3', which is the first letter that was sent by the

8 Vide proceedings of 30

th July 2013 and 3,d September 2013.

18

Appellant on this issue. Unfortunately, the Respondent, for whatever reason,

had chosen to ignore the said letter, and the Appellant therefore did not have

the benefit of a reply to an issue which the Appellant was raising in the general

interest of the membership, and not with regard to the professional conduct of

any individual.

The failure on the part of the Respondent to reply 'P3' resulted in 'P4' being

sent, almost a month later. In 'P4', the Appellant had referred to the Secretary,

Board of Architectural Education by name, although such reference was

limited to steps that were taken in his capacity as Secretary, Board of

Architectural Education. 'P4' too went unanswered by the Respondent,

prompting the Appellant to send 'PS' one month later. 'PS' too contains a

reference to the Secretary, Board of Architectural Education, but once again

with regard to steps that were taken in his capacity as Secretary, Board of

Architectural Education. The Respondent, did not respond to 'PS', but initiated

disciplinary proceedings against the Petitioner by its letter dated 18th August

2010 marked 'P8'.

It appears to this Court that the provisions of the Act draws a distinction

between the conducting of programmes relating to architecture, and the

conducting of examinations for those desirous of becoming a Chartered

Architect, Architect or an Architectural Licentiate. Thus, an issue which could

have been resolved by a simple response by the Respondent, snowballed into

a disciplinary inquiry, disciplinary sanctions and an appeal to this Court. This is

unfortunate, especially since the decision to hand over the conducting of

lectures to a third party was a decision taken by the Respondent and the said

Architect was merely executing or implementing the said decision, in his

19

capacity as the Secretary, Board of Architectural Education. The Secretary was

therefore acting as a 'Liyana Mahattaya' as referred to by the said Architect

himself in his evidence.

This Court, having carefully considered the provisions of Regulation 5.3.3 is of

the view that the provisions of Regulation 5.3.3(2)(d) applies to a duty to

maintain confidentiality with regard to a breach, either alleged or proven, of

any professional obligation set out in 'PI', or with regard to a breach of the

standard of professional performance stipu lated in Regulation 6.5 of 'PI'. In

other words, confidentiality must be maintained where the breach relates to a

professional matter. That does not however mean that a member can engage

in malicious and/or personal criticism of another member, and thereafter take

cover under the pretext that he was only criticising an official act performed by

such member.9

This Court has examined the report of the Disciplinary Committee dated 8

th

January 2014, and finds that apart from holding that 'P4' and 'PS' have been

written by the Appellant and have been circulated, the Disciplinary Committee

has failed to consider the other requirements that need to be established in

order to prove Charge Nos. 3 and 4. Furthermore, this Court observes that the

Committee has not considered the position of the Appellant referred to earlier.

In the light of (a) the explanation offered by the Appellant that he did not

make any personal allegation against the Secretary, Board of Architectural

Education, who this Court must note is a long standing and respected member

of the Respondent; (b) the Appellants explanation that his letters were written

9 The provisions of Regulation S.3.3(2)(c) may be invoked in such a situation.

20

purely with regard to the action taken by the Respondent and the steps that

the said Architect had taken in his capacity as Secretary, Board of Architectural

Education; and (c) the findings of the Disciplinary Committee that the

Appellant had not acted maliciously, this Court is of the view that the decision

of the Disciplinary Committee that the Appellant is guilty of Charge Nos. 3 and

4 cannot be sustained.

This Court must state that the Office bearers of the Respondent, its Council

members and members of its Boards are carrying out their official functions at

great sacrifice to their personal and professional commitments and that they

are only implementing the collective decisions taken by the Respondent, as

was evident by the evidence of the Secretary, Board of Architectural Education

before the Disciplinary Committee Therefore, persons such as the Appellant

who wish to raise issues with regard to the activities of the Respondent must

act responsibly and desist from referring to Office bearers by name. It is

perhaps for this reason that Regulation 5.1(2)(a) of 'PI' specifies that members

of the Respondent, Chartered Architects, Architects, Architectural Licentiates

and Practices shall at all times be guided by the spirit of the Code of

Professional Conduct set out therein.

In the above circumstances, this Court sets aside the Disciplinary Order set out

in the letter dated 1ih February 2014 marked 'PIG'. This Court makes no order

with regard to costs.
