Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner was a warrant officer of the Sri Lanka Air Force at

the time relevant to this application. The Petitioner admits that

in 1994 he was convicted for the offence of being absent from

work for 95 days without official leave. He was punished for this

offence with detention for 28 days and forfeiture of pay for the

said period. In addition, he was issued the strongly-worded

warning letter R2 to inform him that if he committed another

offence, he would be definitely subjected to one of four

punishments, which included dismissal from service. As seen

3

on the face of it, the Petitioner signified his agreement to the

contents of R2 by placing his signature to it. R2 is an official

letter issued by the Commanding Officer. The Petitioner does

not deny R2. Thereafter, in 2014, whilst he was serving in the

supply department of the Air Force Base, Katunayaka, the

Petitioner committed theft of approximately 1,453 brass screw

nails, which were Air Force property. The Petitioner admits he

was charged with two offences in this regard and, upon him

pleading guilty, he was punished with reprimand and severe

reprimand. Soon thereafter, as reflected in P1 and P2, the

Petitioner was discharged from service under the clause His

services being no longer required by the Commander of the Air

Force in terms of item (xiii) (a) of Table B of the Fifth Schedule

read with Regulation 126(1) made in terms of section 155 of the

Air Force Act and published in Gazette No.10,665 dated

23.04.1954.

The said item reads as follows:

4

Cause of Discharge

Competent officer to Special instructions

Authorize discharge

Carryout discharge

Confirm discharge

(xiii)(a) His services being no longer required

Commander of the Air Force

O.C. Officer i/c Records

Applies only to an airman who cannot be discharged under any other item. The application for discharge will be made on special form, on which full particulars of the case will be recorded, and to which the conduct sheets will be attached. If the airman is undergoing detention, the decision of the competent authority to authorize discharge will be reserved until the airman has completed the greater part of his sentence. The authorising officer will decide whether or not the airman is to lose his gratuity under the Air Force regulations relating to Pensions and Gratuities. The decision will be stated on the attestation paper or on the record of service paper.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by a writ of

certiorari the decision of the Commander of the Sri Lanka Air

Force to discharge him from service under the item His services

being no longer required. The pivotal argument of the

Petitioner is that since he had been punished in relation to the

offence of theft by reprimand and severe reprimand, which are

5

on the scale of punishments specified under the Air Force Act,

he cannot be punished twice over by discharge from service

under services no longer required in violation of the doctrine of

double jeopardy.

This important issue comes up before the writ Court quite often

and, I must say, the law on this point is unsettled, as there are

conflicting Judgments of the superior Courts in this regard.

In the Supreme Court case of Air Marshal G.D. Perera v. K.H.M.S.

Bandara (SC Appeal 104/2008, SC Minutes of 29.09.2014), an

officer cadet of the Sri Lanka Air Force was tried summarily and

found guilty of entering an abandoned married-quarters of the

Air Force without due authority and committing criminal

trespass. Punishment of detention for 14-days for the former

offence and 30-days for the latter was imposed. Later, the

officer was exonerated on the latter charge and punishment for

the former only was carried out. The officer served the sentence

and reported for duty only to learn that he had been discharged

from service under the clause services no longer required.

The Court of Appeal quashed this decision of discharge by

certiorari and, on appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed it.

Wanasundare J. on behalf of the Supreme Court inter alia held:

Furthermore, the appellants have not explained as to what

caused the Respondent to be punished and discharged

from service. He was punished at the end of the inquiry.

After he completed the detention period, he was ordered to

be discharged. This is equal to a second sentencing which

is not allowed in law. No person can be punished twice

6

over. I hold that the discharge of the 1st Respondent was

ultra vires.

This Judgment is often quoted to say the Commander has no

authority to discharge a serviceman under the clause services

no longer required if a punishment for the same offence had

already been given, as it is against the doctrine of double

jeopardy.

However, there are decisions handed down by this Court which

have taken the opposite view. For instance, in Mangala

Pushpakumara v. Air Chief Marshal Roshan Gunathilake

(CA/WRIT/448/2009, CA Minutes of 28.03.2012), Anil

Gunaratne J. held that such discharge under the clause

services no longer required is not made as a punishment.

Explaining this further, in Dissanayake v. D.C.J. Weerakoon, Air

Commodore (CA Minutes of 11.09.2017), Dehideniya J. held that

such discharge is not a punishment but only an administrative

step. According to this line of decisions, after the initial

punishment, discharging the serviceman under the clause

services no longer required does not amount to violation of the

doctrine of double jeopardy. Against the aforesaid last-

mentioned Judgment of this Court, there was an appeal to the

Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in Madushanka v. D.J.C.

Weerakoon (SC/SPL/LA/234/2017, SC Minutes of 05.09.2019)

refused special leave to appeal. When special leave is refused,

as no reasons are given, this Court does not have the benefit of

understanding the reasoning behind the refusal. Learned Senior

State Counsel appearing for the Commander of the Air Force in

the instant application was the Counsel for the Commander in

7

the said Supreme Court case (where special leave was refused).

Now there are two apparently conflicting Supreme Court

decisions handed down by Benches constituting a numerically

equal number of Justices.

Mr. Manohara Jayasinghe, learned Senior State Counsel for the

Commander of the Air Force, in his own inimitable style, argued

the point eloquently. He makes a distinction between

punishment meted out soon after conviction and subsequent

discharge under the clause services no longer required. He

contends that the latter is made by the Commander in selected

cases upon having taken stock of all antecedents, including the

past history of the convict, for the greater benefit of the

institution and particularly for the maintenance of discipline

among servicemen. Learned Senior State Counsel argues that

discharge under services no longer required is not a

punishment but an administrative decision and therefore the

same cannot be challenged by application of the doctrine of

double jeopardy. He contends this seemingly unfettered power

in the Air Force Commander is limited by the principles of

Administrative Law which requires that all such decisions be

made reasonably. I am inclined to accept this argument.

It may be relevant to note that item (xiii) (a) inter alia states: The

application for discharge will be made on special form, on which

full particulars of the case will be recorded, and to which the

conduct sheets will be attached. This makes it clear that the

said item is not meant to be used as a punishment for any

specific offence committed under the Air Force Act but, rather,

serves as an administrative measure to be exercised by the

8

Commander, at his discretion, upon taking into consideration

the overall conduct and circumstances of the airman concerned.

Hence, the argument that discharge under the clause services

no longer required amounts to punishing twice over for the

same offence in violation of the doctrine of double jeopardy

cannot be readily accepted. Such discharge is not a punishment

per se but largely an administrative decision for the greater

benefit of the institution, which can only be challenged on the

same grounds any other administrative decision can be

challenged under judicial review. If the presence of any airman

is inimical to maintain the discipline and good order of the Air

Force, the Commander of the Air Force, as the head of the

institution, shall have the power to discharge such airman from

service. It is no secret that discretion is inherent in power as

opposed to duty. It is true in this instance as well. But there is

no unfettered, untrammeled or unreviewable administrative

discretion in modern administrative law. Discretion is subject to

judicial review.

Learned Senior State Counsel further says the earlier quotation

of Justice Wanasundara in Air Marshal G.D. Perera v. K.H.M.S.

Bandara is obiter dicta, as the applicability of the doctrine of

double jeopardy was never raised as a question of law before the

Supreme Court, but in the latter case where special leave to

appeal against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal was refused,

the principle question of law the Supreme Court was called upon

to answer was the application of the doctrine of double jeopardy

in the context of discharge under services no longer required.

Learned Senior State Counsels argument is that the Supreme

Court in Air Marshal G.D. Perera v. K.H.M.S. Bandara decided

9

the matter on the ground of proportionality of the punishment,

not on the doctrine of double jeopardy. I accept the submission

of learned Senior State Counsel that intimation to the doctrine of

double jeopardy in the said Supreme Court Judgment is obiter

dicta and not part of ratio decidendi.

I may further add, with the utmost respect, the said portion of

the Judgment After he completed the detention period he was

ordered to be discharged [under clause service no longer

required]. This is equal to a second sentencing which is not

allowed in law does not represent the correct position of the

law. Let me explain.

It is common ground that by the said item (xiii) (a), the

Commander of the Air Force is given the authority to discharge

an airman under the clause His services being no longer

required. The same item elaborates the power conferred on the

Commander in the following terms:

Applies only to an airman who cannot be discharged under

any other itemIf the airman is undergoing detention, the

decision of the competent officer to authorize discharge will

be reserved until the airman has completed the greater part

of his sentence.

Detention is a punishment on the scale of punishments in the

Air Force Act. From the above excerpt, it is clear that an airman

who has already been convicted and sentenced can be

discharged under services no longer required, as it says such

discharge under services no longer required shall be given

effect to after the airman has completed the greater part of his

10

sentence. This means, the item itself recognises punishment

followed by discharge.

This item says it Applies only to an airman who cannot be

discharged under any other item of Table B of the Fifth

Schedule. In the instant case, the Petitioner does not say that

he could have been discharged under any other item of Table B.

Although it was not specifically raised, let me add this for

completeness. The Petitioner in this case was a warrant officer.

Item (xiii) (a) says it applies only to an airman. According to

section 161 of the Air Force Act, which is the interpretation

section, airman includes a warrant officer.

airman does not include an officer as defined by this Act,

but, subject to the special provisions in this Act contained in

relation to warrant officers and non-commissioned officers,

does include a warrant officer and a non-commissioned

officer.

In the items enumerated in Table B, that the word airman

includes a warrant officer (unless otherwise specified) is made

clear by looking at the item after item (xiii) (a), i.e. item (xiii) (b),

which under Special Instructions says Applies only to an

airman (other than a warrant officer, Class I).

Conferment of authority in the Commanders of the Forces to

dismiss incorrigible recalcitrant servicemen is essential in order

to inter alia maintain discipline in the Forces. Regulation 2 of

the Army Discipline Regulations, 1950, found in Subsidiary

Legislation of Ceylon (1956), Vol. VI, Chapter 356, says The

11

Commander of the Army shall be vested with general

responsibility for discipline in the army. Unlike in most other

institutions, if there is no discipline among the members of the

Armed Forces and also the Police Force, those institutions

cannot function effectively and responsibly. The fundamental

responsibility of the Armed Forces and the Police is to protect

the nation from internal and external enemies, and actively

participate in maintaining law and order. If there is no

discipline, there is no military.

Article 15(8) of the Constitution recognises this concept:

The exercise and operation of the fundamental rights

declared and recognized by Articles 12(1), 13 and 14 shall,

in their application to the members of the Armed Forces,

Police Force and other Forces charged with the maintenance

of public order, be subject to such restrictions as may be

prescribed by law in the interests of the proper discharge of

their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them.

Article 12(1) primarily deals with the right to equality; Article 13

with freedom from arbitrary arrest, detention and punishment;

and Article 14 with freedom of speech, assembly, association,

occupation and movement.

As I have already stated, this power conferred by law is not

unfettered. The Commander shall exercise this power reasonably

and not arbitrarily. How seemingly untrammeled discretion shall

be exercised is summed up by Lord Wrenbury in the celebrated

House of Lords decision in Roberts v. Hopwood [1925] AC 578 at

613 in the following manner:

12

A person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his

discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not

empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is

minded to do so he must in the exercise of his discretion

do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he

must, by the use of his reason, ascertain and follow the

course which reason directs. He must act reasonably.

Failure to act in accordance with the principles of administrative

law will result in the impugned decision being liable to be

quashed by a properly constituted writ application.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, I cannot bring

myself to conclude that the decision of the Commander of the

Air Force to discharge the Petitioner under the clause services

no longer required is patently unreasonable or perverse.

There is no further burden on me to delve into the grounds of

judicial review, as the petitioner in this case challenges the order

of his discharge under the clause services no longer required

on the ground of violation of the doctrine of double jeopardy. I

think I have adequately dealt with that ground.

Although it was not drawn to my attention, I must confess that

the application of item (xiii) (a) in two of my earlier Judgments,

namely, Weerathilake v. Commander, Sri Lanka Air Force,

(CA/WRIT/107/2016, CA Minutes of 05.03.2019) and Wasantha

Kumara v. Commander, Sri Lanka Air Force,

(CA/WRIT/171/2015, CA Minutes of 01.07.2020) is erroneous.

Let me repeat what H.N.G. Fernando J. (later C.J.) said when

confronted with a similar situation in Peiris v. Chairman, Village

13

Committee of Medasiya Pattu Matale (1960) 62 NLR 546 at 547:

While it is disappointing to realize that my judgment was

erroneous, I welcome the opportunity now given me to employ the

language of Baron Bramwell in a similar situation: The matter

does not appear to me now as it appears to have appeared to me

before. This has been quoted by many Judges in the past,

including Wimalachandra J. in Palitha v. Monetary Board of the

Central Bank of Sri Lanka [2012] 1 Sri LR 199 and Bank of

Ceylon v. Warnakulasuriya [2007] 1 Sri LR 33, to accept

unintentional errors. Similar acknowledgement is made by

Mark Fernando J. in State Distilleries Corporation v. Rupasinghe

[1994] 2 Sri LR 394 at 404.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner but without costs.
