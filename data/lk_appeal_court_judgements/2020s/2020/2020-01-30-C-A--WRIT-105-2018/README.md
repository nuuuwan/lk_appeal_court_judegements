Decided on 20.12.2019

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J.

The Petitioner seeks principally a writ of certiorari that would quash the

decision contained in the Gazette notification marked P26 to this

application. The notification P26 dated 21.11.2016 that was published by

the Secretary to the Habaraduwa Pradeshiya Sabha (the 2nd Respondent

to the application) declares that acting in pursuance of the powers vested

in him !her by virtue of Section 9 (3) of Pradeshiya Sabha Act No 15 of 1979

he has made a decision to implement a recommendation made by the

Finance and Policy Making Committee of the Pradeshiya Sabha to impose

a trade licence levy. The notification further goes on to state that he has

entered the recommendation as a decision as item No 61 on 21.10.2016 in

his minute book.

Having thus traced ills decision to the recommendation made by the said

Committee, he determines that certain institutions including a hotel such

as the Petitioner must pay a levy of 1 per cent of their takings for the trade

licence. The learned President's Counsel submitted that the 2nd

Respondent had no power to impose a levy, inasmuch as the Pradesillya

Sabha had long ceased to exist on 15.05.2015.

The power to impose taxes and levies is bestowed on the Pradeshiya Sabha

by virtue of Sections 147, 149 and 152 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No 15 of

1979. In the event that a Pradesillya Sabha is in existence, the aforesaid

provisions mandate a resolution to be passed for the purpose of imposing

any levying taxes and licence duties. For instance the competence to

impose levies on hotel is specifically referred to in the second proviso to

Section 149 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No 15 of 1979. A leviable cap of 1

per cent is also provided for in the proviso as follows:

2

" ........ Provided further, that where a any such premises are used for the purpose of a

hotd, restaurant or lodging house is registered with or approved or recognized by the

Sri Lanka Tourist Board for the purposes of the Tourist Devdopment Act, No 14 of

1968, the duties so levied shall be according to the takings of the hotd or the lodging

house for the year preceding the year in which the licence duty is levied, and shall not

exceed one per centum of such takings ......... "

All the three sections namely 147, 149 and 152 contemplate the passage of

a resolution for the imposition of taxes and licence duties. The power to

impose a levy is thus a legislative function of the Pradeshiya Sabha and the

Indian case of Assistant Collector of Central Excise v National Tobacco

Co ofIndia Ltd 1973 Tax lR 1607; 1973 (1) SCR 822 states thus:

'The term 'levy' is wider in its import than the term 'assessment'. It may

include both imposition of a tax as well as 'assessment', the term

'imposition' generally used for the 'levy' of tax or duty by legislative

provision indicating the subject matter of the tax and the dates at which

it has to be taxed."

Thus it is quite clear that the taxing power must be legislatively bestowed

and from the foregoing any levy or Pradeshiya Sabha must be authorized

by a resolution passed by its members.

What happens when the Pradeshiya Sabha goes out of office or becomes

defunct? When the 2nd Respondent imposed the tax levy as he did in the

gazette notification marked P26, the Presdeshiya Sabha had long gone out

of office. Could the 2nd Respondent have imposed the tax on the Petitioner

as he claims to have done under section 9 (3) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act?

Whilst Mr. Mustapha the learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued that

section 9 (3) does not give the 2nd Respondent any such legislative power,

Mr.Chandana Wijesooriya the learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent

3

contended to the contrary. The argument on behalf of the Petitioner is that

P26 should be quashed for illegality, as it emanated from a person who was

not vested with legislative functions. Mr Chandana Wijesooriya

submitted that when a Pradeshiya Sabha ceases to exist, section 9 (3) vests

him with all the powers of the Pradeshiya Sabha. In order to appraise the

merit of these submissions, it is befitting that one bears in mind the

content of Section 9 (3) vis a vis the legislative scheme.

Section 9 (3) goes as follows:

Where a Pradeshiya Sabha is unable to discharge its functions by rcason of the

Chairman and Vice Chairman ceasing to hold office, the Secretary shall, during any

period that elapses between the occurrence of the vacancies in respect of those offices and

the filling of those vacancies in accordance with the provisions of the Local Authorities

Elections Ordinance have, exercise, perform and discharge all the rights, privileges,

powers, duties and functions vested in or conferred or imposed on the Pradeshiya Sabha,

the Chairman or Vice Chairman by this Act or by any other written law.

In my view this provision has not eroded the legislative functions or

powers conferred by section 147, 149 and 152 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act.

The Secretary of a Pradeshiya Sabha who is described as the Chief

Administrative Officer in Section 9 (2) has to be authorized with

legislative power specifically and sans such authorization sections 147, 149

and 152 cannot be said to have been diluted or eroded. In any event I am of

the view that the legislative provisions contemplate an additional element

of members of the PS participating in a legislative process and I do not hold

the view that in the absence of a Pradeshiya Sabha section 9 (2) enables

the Secretary to step into the shoes of the members of the Pradeshiya

Sabha to impose taxes or levies. In my view sections 147, 149 and 152 of

the Pradeshiya Sabha Act are standalone provisions and the powers

immanent in these provisions are not transferred to the Secretary by virtue

4

of Section 9 (3). What is transferred by virtue of section 9 (2) are functions

of the Pradeshiya Sabha, which are specifically referred to in Section 3 of

the Pradeshiya Sabha Act. Section 3 lays down:

The Pradeshiya Sabha constituted for each Pradeshiya Sabha shall be the local

authority within such area and be charged with the regulation, control and

administration of all matters relating to public health, public utility services and public

thoroughfares and generally with the protection and promotion of the comfort,

convenience and welfare of the people and all amenities within such area.

These functions are spelt out in separate chapters which contain specific

sections delineating those functions-see for instance Sections 21 and 98.

So the transference of powers in the interim period is limited to Section 3

functions and I take the view that powers in Section 147,149 and 152 never

vest in the Secretary when the local authority ceases to hold office.

In the circumstances I take the view that P26 is ultra vires the Secretary.

Abdication of Power

Assuming without conceding that he possesses these powers, it is quite

evident that he has abdicated these powers. Though the 2nd Respondent

states in his statement of objections that he made the decision, that

assertion is contradicted by the Gazette notification P26. P26 which uses

both words "recommendation" and "decision" goes on to state that the

Secretary publishes the recommendation for the purpose of giving efficacy

to it. It is as plain as a pikestaff that the Secretary has adopted the

recommendation without any independent analysis on his own. There is

no material on record that the 2nd Respondent brought to bear on his mind

the merits and demerits of a committee that advised him. In such a

situation he cannot claim to be the decisi.on maker but rather it is the

committee that has acted as the decision maker. Wade Cst Forsyth in their

Administrative Law (11th Edition, p269) states that clearly akin to

5

delegation, and scarcely distinguishable from it in some cases, is any

arrangement by which a power conferred upon one authority is in

substance exercised by another .... The effect then is that the discretion

conferred by Parliament's exercised, at least in part, by the wrong

authority, and the resulting decision is ultra vires and avoid.

There is also another vitiating element to which I would advert. The

advice has been preferred by a Finance and Policy Making Committee

which was appOinted by the Secretary on the recommendation made by

the Commissioner of Local Authorities. There is no legislative sanction for

this course of action. Sections 12 (1) and (2) are quite clear. This committee

is appointed by the Pradeshiya Sabha itself and it must comprise members

of the Sabha and non-members. It is thereafter that the Finance and Policy

Making Committee could advise on the legislative function of imposing

taxes.

In this particular instance, the committee was appointed by the Secretary

and it consisted of officials who are not authorised to sit in that committee.

In the circumstances the composition of the committee was illegally

constituted and the advice that flowed from it was a nullity. When the

Secretary adopted it, he approbated a nullity. One cannot put something

on nothing. It collapses like Humpty Dumpty.

It was Lord Denning who pertinently made this observation in Maclav v.

United Afdca Co. Ltd [1961J 3 ALL ER 1169 at 1172 thus:

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad, but incurably bad. There is

no need for an order of the court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void. Without

more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And

every proceeding which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You cannot put

something on nothing and expect it to stay there. It will collapse.

lordship then was) in Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera [1982] 1 Sri Kantha

lR 164 at 168-169.

In the circumstances I proceed to quash P26 by way of a writ of certiorari

allow this application for judicial review.
