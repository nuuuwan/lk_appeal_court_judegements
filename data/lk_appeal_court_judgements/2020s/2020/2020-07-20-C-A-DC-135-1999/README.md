This is an appeal from the judgment of the Learned Additional District Judge of Colombo dated

22.01.1999. The Learned Trial Judge had dismissed the case of the Plaintiff-Appellants (herein

after sometimes referred to as the Plaintiffs) seeking a declaration of title and a permanent

injunction against the Defendant-Respondents (herein after sometimes referred to as the

Defendants) preventing them from entering upon the said land and from infringing the

Plaintiffs rights.

2

The Plaintiffs have pleaded a partition decree, entered in the year 1971 in District Court Case

No.12462/P in Colombo, as the source of the 1" Plaintiff's title. In terms of this partition

decree the corpus which is referred to in the paragraph 1 of the schedule and presently bears

Assessment No.163/7, Nawala Road, Narahenpita, was allotted to the 6th Defendant in that

Partition case, namely one Benedict. There was no dispute regarding the corpus.

By Deed NO.1017 dated 29th November 1978, attested by T.R. Pullayanayagam N.P, the 6th

Defendant Benedict sold the said land to the 1" Plaintiff, in the present case. The Plaintiff

states that the 1" Defendant was claiming the property since April 1992 and then the 2nd

Defendant, namely I.G. Somi Nona was claiming title to the said property upon deed number

528 dated 12.03.1992 attested by D.S. Kirindawella N.P. upon purchase from the 1"

Defendant. Thereafter 2nd Defendant died intestate on 21.04,2000 and the executor of the

said intestate heirs executed deed of conveyance no. 243 dated 20.06.2001 transferring the

property to the intestate heirs who in turn transferred the property to V"J.Wickramasinghe

on 30.11.2001.

After some time V.J.Wickramasinghe died intestate and by administrators conveyance the

property in suit was transferred again to the substituted 2nd Defendant Respondents.

The present case was filed in the DC- Colombo, by the Plaintiffs on 01.06.1992 and the

Judgement was delivered on the 22.01.1999. This Appeal was pending in the Court of Appeal

for 20 years. Finally, all parties agreed to disposed off this matter by way of written

submissions.

It is evident that on the 25th of April 1992, T. Balakrishnan, the Plaintiff's Power of Attorney

holder, had proceeded to the land along with a surveyor and they were prevented from

entering the land by few persons who claimed that the 1" Defendant Piyadasa had title for

the same land.

When the case was taken up for arguments, the main point raised by the Defendant

Respondents was, that the Appeal Court should not interfere with the finding of facts, made

by a Trial Court unless a finding is totally unsupported by the evidence, as demonstrated in

the case of De Silva and others v. Seneviratne (1981) 2 SLR 07

3

However, the Plaintiff Appellants state that it is abundantly clear that the finding of the

Learned Additional District Judge is so erroneous and is totally unsupported by evidence.

Therefore, to prevent a grave miscarriage of justice, the Plaintiffs request for intervention of

this court by exercising its Appellate jurisdiction.

The Plaintiffs argue that even under the threshold conditions in the decided case of De Silva

and others Vs. Seneviratne (supra) as cited by the Respondent, the findings of facts made by

the Trial Court is totally unsupported by evidence and therefore justice requires intervention

of this Appellate Court. The attention of court is also invited to Nicholas vs Macan Markar

Limited 1985(1) SLR 130 wherein this court has, at Page 139, held that " ... when hearing an

appeal, the Court should be concerned with the merits of the decision in appeal".

When considering the above authority, it is important to look into the merits of this case.

The Defendant Respondents have stated as follows;

a) The 1st Defendant doesn't dispute the rights of the Plaintiff and

pleaded that the 1st Defendant had acquired title by long adverse

and uninterrupted possession for a period of well over 10 years and

had obtained a declaration of title from the District Court of

Colombo in case bearing No.5218/ZL

b) The 1st Defendant had thereafter sold the said premises to the 2,d

Defendant on 12.03.1992 by deed No.528 attested by Mrs.D.S.

Kirindawella N.P.

It was held in Sirajudeen Vs Abbas 1994 (2) SLR 365, that in a Rei Vindicatio action, the burden

of proof rests fairly and squarely on the person, if he is claiming prescription and has to be

proved with specific facts and not mere statements. A facile story of walking into abandoned

premises after the Japanese air raid constitutes material far too slender to found a claim

based on prescriptive title.

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of

witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the

prescriptive period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary

4

to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific

facts and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by Court. In the present

case it had never happened.

It was further held that one of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as

provided for in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance is, proof of possession by a title

adverse to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of the premises

must be of such character as is incompatible with the title of the owner. Furthermore, it was

stated that, where the evidence of possession lacked consistency, the fact of occupation alone

or the payment of Municipal rates by itself is insufficient to establish prescriptive possession.

It was decided in Chelliah Vs. Wijenathan 54 NLR 337, where a party invokes the provisions of

section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse

claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests squarely and fairly on him to

establish a starting point for his acquisition of prescriptive rights. I cannot see that Piyadasa

has established such a starting point through his witnesses or by his evidence, before the

District Court.

The Plaintiff Appellants argument was that the Defendant Respondents had failed to

discharge those fundamental requirements because the evidence clearly points out a fraud

perpetrated by the Respondents. The Plaintiff Appellant on the other hand has very clearly

established lawful purchase and title. There is no need for a lawful owner to prove possession

unless and until a person claiming prescription establishes that he, in fact had uninterrupted,

undisturbed, and adverse possession for more than 10 years for the property, which is

properly identified.

In his evidence the 1" Defendant, Piyadasa states that he was in possession of this land for

which he claims prescription since 1962. He also states that since 1962 - 1992 no one

interfered with his possession. Then he goes on to allege that he made a plan in 1968, and

therefore the corpus for which he is claiming prescription has to be the corpus he came into

occupation in 1968. However, there has been a partition decree delivered in 1973 in DC Case

No.12462/P in the District Court of Colombo for a larger land of the same property. That

Partition decree divided the said larger land called "Ramsay Gardens" into 06 lots and lot 1B,

containing perches 17.3 is the subject matter and corpus of this present Appeal.

5

It appears that the Corpus that the respondent Piyadasa, stated that he was in occupation

since 1962, has to be a part of the same Corpus, prior to partition in the year 1973. According

to the deed of declaration that Piyadasa wrote on the 04.05.1988, the Corpus that is described

in the deed is not the 1962 land, but one of the lots after Partition. Therefore, the assertion

that there was no dispute as to the Corpus, has to be rejected.

As per the evidence by the 1st Defendant Piyadasa, he had no knowledge of the legal title

holder what so ever. It reflects that there was no adverse possession. It can be called as

"reserved" title and there was no adverse claim by the Defendant, against the Plaintiff to have

the Prescriptive title for the disputed property. It is evident that the 1st Defendant Piyadasa's

adverse and Prescriptive possession was a "secret" one. When the 1st Defendant was not

having any knowledge about the legal title holder of the disputed land, how can he claim

adversity for the Prescriptive title?

It was held in the case of Gunawardena Vs. Samarakoon 60 NLR 481 that, by Secret

occupation of the land or possession by encroacher or a trespasser cannot be considered as

adverse possession.

When the evidence of the Plaintiff is taken into consideration, it appears that the Plaintiff has

the paper title to the property in suit. The Defendants never contested the Plaintiffs rights to

the disputed land. In that case the burden of proof, was with the Defendants to prove on a

balance of probability, that the 1st Defendant Piyadasa was in undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession, adverse to all the other title holders of this land, to acquire Prescriptive title for

him. It was not done.

The Plaintiffs argue that the disputed property came into existence through the final decree

awarded in Partition Case No. 12462/P, which was finalized on 07.11.1973 in the District Court

of Colombo. Although the 1't Defendant claimed that he occupied the disputed property from

1962 to 1992, I believe that it cannot be true as the final decree was entered in the said

Partition action was, in November 1973. Piyadasa never participated in that Partition action.

The decree in partition case 12462/P was no doubt, a decree in rem. Therefore, even if he

was having the possession as a scoter or as an encroacher or as a trespasser, on the disputed

land, it should have been ended after the final decree is entered by the District Court in the

6

Partition action. There was no evidence to prove that Piyadasa was having any adverse

possession on the disputed land, even after 1973.

In the case of Seeman Vs. David 2000 (3) SLR 23, it was held that the proof of adverse

possession is a condition precedent to claim prescriptive rights.

It is important to note that the 1st Defendant claimed that, he achieved to retain possession,

despite efforts by two persons to oust him in 1987 and 1988 period. One person was OIC

Narahenpita Police station, Inspector Fabian Mitchell and the other one was named

Periyasamy. It is interesting to note that Defendant Piyadasa declared ownership by

Prescriptive title on 04.05.1988 by Deed of Declaration bearing number 334 attested by A.H.T.

Dayananda N.P. The plan included in this deed was the Partition Plan No. 2332 in the previous

Partition case 12462/P of 1971, drawn by S.R. Yapa Licensed Surveyor. It reflects that Piyadasa

was having a knowledge about the Partition action. Virtually speaking 1st Defendant Piyadasa

could have claimed prescription after completing 10 years from 04.05.1988. As the present

DC case was instituted on 01.06.1992, Piyadasa is unable to claim prescription against the

Plaintiff during that 4-year period.

The court further observes that, after Piyadasa was threatened by those 2 persons in

1988/1989, he has given evidence to say that he was not living in that disputed land as his life

was in danger. This also confirms that he was not having uninterrupted possession on the

land in question.

Thereafter Piyadasa filed an action 5812/ZL, against those 2 persons, namely Fabian Mitchell

and Periyasamy in the D.C. Cololmbo. This case went ex-parte against both of them and

Piyadasa had used this ex-parte Judgment to confirm his Prescriptive title for the next

transaction. Periyasamy's address is given as No. 163/7, Nawala Road, Narahenpita which is

the address of the same disputed property in the present action. If Periyasamy was residing

in that same property, then Piyadasa would have definetely been residing in some other

place. Appeal brief confirms that, Piyadasa has used his residential address as No.28, Nawala

Road, Colombo 5, for the DC case No. 5812/ZL. This clearly proves that even at that time he

was not living on the disputed land.

The Defendant states that as per the evidence given by the 1st Defendant Respondent

Piyadasa, he claims to have had uninterrupted possession of the property from 1962 until the

7

land was sold to the 2nd Defendant Respondent by Deed of Transfer bearing No.528 in 1992.

According to his evidence he used to grow Plantains, Kankun and Keera on the said property.

Those evidence were never supported by any other independent witnesses. Therefore, in my

openion those evidence cannot believe as true because, Piyadasa cannot be considered as a

reliable and a genuine witness.

It is evident that, Piyadasa had prepared a Deed of declaration bearing NO.334 attested by

A.H.T.Dayananda Notary Public dated 04'h May 1988, which he relied on to establish

ownership over the property. The said deed of declaration relied on Plan No.2332 surveyed

by S.R. Yapa to demarcate the boundaries dated 24'h October 1971. The said Plan No.2332

refers to Lot No.1B which was only demarcated and partitioned by Partition action bearing

case No.12462/P which took place in 1973. The Plan No.2332 was prepared for the purpose

of the said Partition action. The Plaintiff Appellant states that the 1st Defendant Respondent

in his evidence however does not refer to the said Partition action or survey conducted by

Mr.S.R. Yapa. He only refers to a plan that was drafted by one Mr.Abeygunawardena in 1968.

But subsequently the Defendant Piyadasa, heavily relied on Survey Plan No.2332 to prepare

the Deed of Declaration and to institute DC Case No.5812/ZL, in which he obtained an ex-

parte order in his favor.

Thus, the 1st Defendant Respondent could not have been aware of the said Partition and the

Survey of the land by Surveyor S.R.Yapa, if he was in actual possession of the property,

especially as the same was referred to in the instruments registered in the Land Registry.

It is important to be noted that the Piyadasa's deed of declaration was registered in the land

registry on 06.05.1988 and it was long after the Plaintiff's deed of transfer was registered on

the 30.11.1979. The Plaintiff is having the priority over the Defendants deed under section 24

of the Registration of Documents Ordinance.

After I perused the said evidence it is of much significance to observe that Piyadasa never had

an opportunity for undisturbed and uninterrupted possession adverse to the Plaintiff on this

land, to acquire Prescriptive title. According to the available evidence it is my view that,

Piyadasa couldn't prove his uninterrupted, undisturbed, and adverse possession for 10 years.

Taking in to consideration the disability clause, 13(e) of the Prescription Ordinance this court

cannot be unmindful of the important statutory provisions as such.

8

Section 13 of the Prescription Ordinance provides as follows;

"Provided nevertheless, that if at the time when the right of any person to sue for the recovery

of any immovable property shall have first accrued, such person shall have been under any of

the disabilities hereinafter mentioned, that is to say-

(a) infancy,

(b) idiocy,

(c) unsoundness of mind,

(d) lunacy, or

(e) absence beyond the seas,

then and so long as such disability shall continue the possession of such immovable property

by any other person shall not be taken as giving such person any right or title to the said

immovable property, as against the person subject to such disability or those claiming under

him, but the period of ten years required by section 3 of this Ordinance shall commence to

be reckoned from the death of such last-named person, or from the termination of such

disability, whichever first shall happen; but no further time shall be allowed in respect of the

disabilities of any other person;

Provided also that the adverse and undisturbed possession for thirty years of any immovable

property by any person claiming the same, or by those under whom he claims, shall be taken

as conclusive proof of title in manner provided by section 3 of this Ordinance,

notwithstanding the disability of any adverse claimant."

The Plaintiffs have gone abroad in 1982 and there was no evidence to say that they were living

in Sri Lanka during that current period. Therefore, section 13 (e) will have a direct impact

against Piyadasa, when he was claiming Prescriptive title against the Plaintiff. While they were

in abroad the 1st Plaintiff has given authority to her Power of Attorney holder, Balakrishnan

to construct a building on the disputed land. It is evident that a complaint was lodged by said

Balakrishnan after he went to the disputed land in 1992 with a Surveyor, when he was

threatened and disturbed, not to enter the land by a group of people connected to Piyadasa.

The Appellant explains how possession was exercised by her and her power of Attorney

holder Balakrishnan. The Appellant states that as a legal owner, living overseas for some time

during the relevant period, she was exercised sufficient care and diligence in "possessing" an

9

empty land. In fact, since the Appellants take up the position that the Respondent never lived

on this land and there was no need for the Appellant to do or take any further or additional

steps or actions with regard to "possessing" the empty land she legally owns. Similarly, the

Respondents appear to base their claim on what they see as two physical characteristics of

the land which the Plaintiff Appellant couldn't describe.

Subsequent to a thorough analysis of the facts of the case, it has come to my notice that the

1st Defendant had not claimed prescription and that prescriptive title was only claimed by the

2nd Defendant on behalf of the 1st Defendant in his answer. This is a desperate argument

based on total misconception of the pleadings. It would be seen that the 1st Defendant

asserted prescription by him and had pleaded the subsequent sale to the 2nd Defendant. It is

important to note that paragraph 11 of the answer of the 1st Defendant, specifically stated

that the property had been sold to the 2nd Defendant and sought a dismissal of the action.

Moreover, section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance, states as follows;

"Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a defendant in any action, or by

those under whom he claims, of lands or immovable property, by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in such action (that is to say, a possession

unaccompanied by payment of rent or produce, or performance of service or duty, or by any

other act by the possessor, from which an acknowledgment of a right existing in another

person would fairly and naturally be inferred) for ten years previous to the bringing of such

action, shall entitle the defendant to a decree in his favor with costs. And in like manner, when

any plaintiff shall bring his action, or any third party shall intervene in any action for the

purpose of being quieted in his possession of lands or other immovable property, or to

prevent encroachment or usurpation thereof, or to establish his claim in any other manner to

such land or other property, proof of such undisturbed and uninterrupted possession as

herein before explained, by such plaintiff or intervenient, or by those under whom he claims,

shall entitle such plaintiff or intervenient to a decree in his favor with costs:

10

Provided that the said period of ten years shall only begin to run against parties claiming estates

in remainder or reversion from the time when the parties so claiming acquired a right of

possession to the property in dispute."

In terms of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance the requirements for positive prescription of

land are "undisturbed and uninterrupted possession ... by a title adverse to or independent of that

of the claimant ... for ten years previous to the bringing of such action ... " The critical factor of

adverse possession is specifically elaborated on, in a much-discussed part of the section.

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to

defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the burden of proof rests

squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive

rights.

As regards the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of witnesses

that the plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive

period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary to support a title

by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts and the question

of possession has to be decided thereupon by Court.

One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive title as provided for in section 3 of the

Prescription Ordinance is proof of possession by a title adverse to or independent of that of the

claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of the premises must be of such character as is incompatible

with the title of the owner.

Sharvananda, J. in Theivandran v. Ramanathan Chettiar 1986( 2 )SLR 219 at 222 stated as

follows:

"In a vindicatory action the claimant needs merely prove two facts; namely, that he is the

owner of the thing and that the thing to which he is entitled to possession by virtue of his

ownership is in the possession of the defendant. Basing his claim on his ownership, which

entities him to possession, he may sue for the ejectment of any person in possession of it

without his consent. Hence, when the legal title to the premises is admitted or proved to be in

the plaintiff, the burden of proof is on the defendant to show that he is having lawful

possession".

11

In the instant case the 1st Defendant could not establish that he is having a prescriptive title

with uninterru pted and adverse possession against the Plaintiffs.

There is another relevant aspect of the plea of prescriptive title which was overlooked by the

present trial Judge. That principle is best stated in the words of Gratiaen, J. in Chelliah v.

Wijenathan 54 NLR 337, where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance in order to defeat the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property, the

burden of proof rests squarely and fairly on him to establish a starting point for his acquisition of

prescriptive rights."

The Defendant has failed to prove, when he started his adverse possession against the Plaintiffs.

It is important to quote from Walter Pereira's Laws of Ceylon, 2nd Edition, page 396. "As regards

the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere general statements of witnesses that the

plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive period

are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse possession necessary to support a title by

prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts, and the question of

possession has to be decided thereupon by court".

In the present case there is a significant absence of clear and specific evidence on such acts of

possession as wou ld entitle the 1st Defendant to a decree in his favor in terms of section 3 ofthe

Prescription Ordinance.

In any event therefore, it is important to note that mere possession, in the absence of

requirements of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance would not suffice to acquire prescriptive

title. The Plaintiff Appellant on the other hand has very clearly established lawful purchase and

title and there is no need for a lawful owner to prove possession unless and until a person

claiming prescription establishes that he in fact had uninterrupted, undisturbed, and adverse

possession for more than 10 years of a property. In fact, in paragraph 2 in page 14 of the

Judgment (page 279 of Appeal Brief) the Learned Trial Judge has acknowledged that the

ownership of the property is not challenged by the 1st and 2nd Defendant Respondents.

12

would be protected by Orders and Judgements of Court and the rights of lawful owners of

properties would not be protected by Courts.

It is pertinent to consider observation made by Sansoni J. in the case of M. Kanapathipillai Vs.

M.Meerasaibo 58 NLR 41 at page 43 wherein His Lordship observed as follows;

"There is a well-established rule that the law will presume in favor of honesty and against fraud"

The learned trial Judge, before making the impugned Judgment in this case, should have been

mindful of the above observation made by His Lordship Sansoni J. in the said case.

When I consider all the aforementioned matters I reject the contention of learned Counsel for

the Defendant Respondents and I hold that the learned Additional District Judge was wrong when

he dismissed the Plaintiff's case.

For the foregoing reasons the claim of prescription made by the 1" Defendant Piyadasa and the

2'd defendant Somie Nona appears to me as absolutely frivolous. Taking into consideration the

matters urged by the Appellants, I find that the material placed before the original court, does

not establish the Prescriptive title of the 1" Defendant or the 2,d Defendant and the Judgment of

the learned Additional District Judge dated 22.01.1999 is here by set aside.

Appeal allowed Plaintiffs are entitled for cost in this courts 'as well as in the District Court.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

Janak De Silva J.

I have had the benefit of reading in draft the judgment of my learned brother. I agree with his

conclusion that the appeal must be allowed.

However, I respectfully take a different view on two of the issues dealt with therein.

In this case, the 1" Defendant has failed to establish a starting point for his acquisition of

prescriptive rights as required by law [Chelliah v. Wijenathan (54 N.L.R. 337)J. In these

circumstances, section 13 of the Prescription Ordinance is not engaged as the time when the

right of the Plaintiff to sue for the recovery of the immovable property has not been determined.

13

Furthermore, it is true that the 1st Defendant has not c1~imed prescriptive title in the answer.

However, issue no. 7 raises the questior, of prescriptive title of the 1st Defendant. The trial

proceeds on the. issues and the pleadings recede to the background [Hono!!i v. Nollommo [1998)

1 SrLL.R. 73J.

Subject to the above, the appeal Is allowed. The Plaintiffs are entitled to the costs in both Courts.
