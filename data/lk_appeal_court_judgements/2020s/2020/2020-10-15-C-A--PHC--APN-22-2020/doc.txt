ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 3rd Suspect-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred as the

Petitioner) had invoked revisionary jurisdiction of this Court conferred

under Article 138 of the Constitution seeking to set aside an order of the

High Court of Colombo in HCBAj543j2019 made on 21.11.2019, by which

the said Court had refused his application for bail. He also seeks an order

from this Court enlarging him on bail.

On 07.12.2018, officers attached to Yatiyanthota Police Station have

arrested the Petitioner, when he swam across the Kelani river, while

carrying cash amounting to Rs. 1,600,000.00 in his possession and handed

him over to the 2nd Respondent.

2

The Petitioner was produced before the Magistrate's Court of

Colombo under case No. B/3594/01/2018 as the 3rd suspect, in relation to a

detection of 231.054 kilo grams of Heroin from the multi day fishing

trawler "Yamuna Abdulla", made by the officers attached to Police

Narcotics Bureau on 05.12.2018, off the seas of Beruwala along with the

brother of the Petitioner and another, who were named as the 1st and 2nd

suspects respectively. The Petitioner was initially kept under a detention

order during the period 08.12.2018 to 14.12.2018 and was committed to

remand custody thereafter.

Upon information provided by the Petitioner during investigations,

the officers of PNB have recovered two sets of satellite phones with SIM

cards from his house at No. 295/03, Godella, Moragalle, Beruwala on

12.12.2018, along with a polythene bag containing cash amounting to Rs.

5,900,000.00 and three pass books belonging to his wife. They, in addition

have recovered a piece of paper with names and figures scribbled on from

the Petitioner.

The officers have also taken charge of a multiday fishing vessel,

named "Dori 2", belonging to the Petitioner and its GPS set, while being

berthed in the Baruwala fishery harbour and a polysack from its hold, which

appeared similar to the other polysacks, recovered along with the detection

of Heroin from the other vessel.

It is informed to the Magistrate's Court by the PNB, through its

further reports filed in that Court their investigations revealed that, upon

instructions of the Petitioner, his brother the 1st suspect had gone to sea in

the fishing vessel belonged to the 2nd suspect to meet up with a vessel

3

belong to the Petitioner in high seas to receive a consignment of Heroin

They have then expected to hand it over to another vessel. It is also

informed by the PNB, that after receiving the said consignment, the 1st and

2nd suspects have attempted to hand it over to a person called" Ami/a" and

at that point of time they were arrested by the PNB officers. The Petitioner,

using multiple telephone connections, was in contact with two persons

based in Seychelles, who were introduced to him through his then fiancee

(a Dutch national) and had overseered the entire operation.

The factual background, in relation to the instant application for

revision is stated by the Petitioner as follows. The Petitioner is a qualified

diver who later developed a relationship with one " Dori", a Dutch

national, who had financed the purchase of the multiday fishing vessel

Dori 2. The Petitioner operated the multiday fishing vessel using

employees and used to finance long fishing expeditions. He had re-

invested his profits from fishing, in a banana plantation off Monaragala.

After the return of his vessel, with a catch of over 3 1/z Metric tons of

fish, which the Petitioner had sold at Beruwala. He was contemplating to

purchase a vehicle. With this purpose in mind, he had travelled to

Yatiyanthota from Monaragala and had withdrawn Rs. 1.5 Million, in

addition to Rs. 100,000.00 he had with him (mistakenly stated in his

Petition as Rs. 1,000,000.00), in case he wanted to complete the intended

transaction. As he withdrew cash from the Bank, he felt suspicious of two

individuals who were lurking around (who later transpired as undercover

PNB officers) and decided to take the aqueous route by swimming across

the Kelani river to prevent him being "robbed" but was arrested by

Yatiyanthota Police on the other side of the river.

4

The Petitioner had sought to provide an explanation for the

discovery of Rs. 5.9 Million from his house as he claims that those funds

were meant for the loan installment of his Rs. 6 Million loan, funds

allocated for the next fishing expedition which is in the range of Rs. 1.8 to

2 Million, given the fact that he had to provide adequate food, medicine

and fuel for the crew and to the boat for the 40 to 45-day period at sea, and

funds allocated for the essential repair work for his other boat.

It is stated by the Petitioner, he applied for bail from the High Court,

but was denied and therefore seeks revision of the said order of refusal on

the following exceptional grounds;

a. absence of any prima facie evidence against the Petitioner to

successfully maintain any of the charges referred to in the B

report,

b. incarceration of the Petitioner aggravated the mentality of his

children in particular the youngest had to attend the scholarship,

c. subsistence of family of Petitioner was threatened and his

liabilities to the banks escalated due to incarceration,

d. families of the employees who worked under him suffered

economically due to the lapse of his business while he was in

remand,

e. absence of any antecedents against the Petitioner.

The Respondents have resisted the Petitioner's application for

revision on the basis that he was identified by the investigators as the

principal offender and was arrested while evading arrest. It was also

stated by the Respondents that the grounds urged by the Petitioner are no

5

exceptional in nature and qualifies him to be enlarged on bail. They

contended that the order of the High Court is a legally tenable order.

In view of the above considerations, this Court now turns its

attention to consider validity of the challenge to the order of the High

Court in refusing bail.

Learned President's Counsel, in support of the revision application,

contended that the failure of the High Court, in taking into account of the

prospect of total economic ruination of the Petitioner as a result of his

continued incarceration over an investigation, which had not revealed any

wrong doing on the part of the Petitioner and would not result in a strong

prosecution against him, are sufficient to render the order of refusal of bail

to be revised by this Court. He added that the deterioration of mental

health of the younger child, owing to the long incarceration of the

Petitioner, a fact that had been confirmed by the concerned medical

professionals, should also have been considered by the High Court in

favour of the Petitioner.

The High Court, in its impugned order had correctly applied the

applicable law in relation to the application of the Petitioner, when it

considered the issue whether there were exceptional circumstances,

entitling the Petitioner to be enlarged on bail. The Petitioner is a suspect

of committing offences under the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended and Section 83 of the said Ordinance imposes the

condition that unless in exceptional circumstances bail should not be

considered, in relation to persons suspected or accused under the said

Ordinance.

6

Having considered the grounds that had been urged before

the Court, namely, the long period of incarceration, the Petitioner being

the sole breadwinner of the family and the adverse effect of his continued

incarceration on the mental health of his 7-year-old child, the High Court

had termed them as set of personal circumstances and considered them as

consequences that are common to all who are being in remand. It had also

considered the long duration of remand and the claim of weak prosecution

and that too had failed to satisfy the Court as exceptional grounds.

In this context, this Court notes that certain personal circumstances,

although generally not considered as exceptional as they are common to

most, who are placed under similar circumstances, has the potential of

being considered as exceptional, if they pass beyond a certain threshold. In

the judgment Attorney General v Ediriweera 2006 BLR 12 the Supreme

Court sets out the said threshold;

"It is trite law that family circumstances are not considered

to be exceptional but circumstances which are general and

operative in almost all the cases. The facts and circumstances

of the case must take it out of the ordinary, creating

circumstances that are sufficiently exceptional to merit the

grant of bail ... ".

This Court must therefore review the impugned order, in order to

verify whether the circumstances that had been urged, although generally

considered as personal, satisfy the criterion of circumstances that" ... take it

out of the ordinary, creating circumstances that are sufficiently exceptional to

merit the grant of bail".

The Petitioner, who owns multiday fishing vessels, apparently was

carrying on a successful business venture in the fishery industry when he

was arrested in connection with the detection of Heroin. He claims that he

had re-invested profits from his fishing trade in agriculture through a

banana plantation in Monaragala.

In support of the looming prospect of total" economic ruination" of

the Petitioner, learned President's Counsel heavily relied on the fact that

the banks, who lent money to him are demanding their overdue loan

installments, and the boat which was under repair too needed funding.

The young family also needed to be maintained and if the Petitioner could

not restart his economic activity within a short period, he faces the gloomy

prospect of total economic ruination, a prospect the Legislature never

intended.

This claim of the prospect of economic ruination needed a closer

scrutiny.

Learned President's Counsel submitted that the loan repayments

and repair bills were accumulating due to his continued incarceration and

therefore the Petitioner would be left with no income to service such

facilities. In support of this claim, the letters of warning issued by such

institutions were tendered.

The letter issued by Peoples Bank is dated 05.12.2019 indicated that

a balance of Rs. 189,961.29 is due upon the Rs. 6 Million loan and the

failure to settle the dues would follow legal proceedings intended to

recover the said sum. The letter issued by Mechanical Engineer of Central

Mechanical Workshop at Beruwala, informed the Petitioner's wife of the

8

importance of removing a vessel, kept at his workshop for over 23 months,

without being repaired. That letter is dated 01.11.2018.

In relation to the Peoples Bank, the remaining balance is only Rs.

189,961.29 and it appears that the loan had been serviced even after the

Petitioner was remanded. As for the repair bill, the letter was issued prior

to his arrest and even then, the vessel was merely lying at the workshop

for over 23 months, which indicates the remanding of the Petitioner is not

the reason for that state of affairs. It does not indicate of any financial

liability imposed on the part of the Petitioner on account of the said vessel.

Turning to the issue of the adverse effect on the mental health of his

daughter, the medical reports indicate that she was diagnosed with

"adjustment disorder" since July 2019 and receiving medical care under a

Consultant Psychiatrist. Unfortunately, the mental trauma caused to

family members due to they being separated from loved ones too is an

inevitable but common result in these circumstances, and therefore would

not help the Petitioner

Learned President's Counsel was confident that a future prosecution

against the Petitioner, based on scanty evidence, would not last long, in

view of its inherent weaknesses. This Court notes from the further reports

filed by the PNB before the Magistrate's Court that it had undertaken a

complex investigation, including digital forensics, into what they claim as

an international drug smuggling operation. Therefore, this Court leaves

that issue to be considered by the trial Court, if the Hon. Attorney General

decided to forward an indictment against the Petitioner, upon the

9

completion of investigations, since the trial Court is the best place to deal

with it.

Thus, it is clear that the personal circumstances urged by the

Petitioner fails to pass beyond the threshold imposed by the Supreme

Court; "the facts and circumstances of the case must take it out of the ordinary,

creating circumstances that are sufficiently exceptional to merit the grant of bail"

and therefore the order of the High Court is not tainted with any iIIegality

or irregularity.

The application to revise the impugned order of the High Court is

accordingly refused.

The petition of the Petitioner is dismissed.
