This is an application for Revision against the Judgment of High Court of Colombo affinning

the Order made by the Learned Magistrate of Colombo on the case bearing the number

3934/06115 dated 11.08.2017. The instant order is concerned with, whether the Complainant

- Petitioner - Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the "Petitioner") is entitled to proceed with

the Revision Application under exceptional circumstances.

FACTS OF THE CASE

The Petitioner is a Company duly registered and incorporated under the Companies Act,

No.07 of 2007. The Petitioner Company involves in the business of importation and

distribution of fertilizer and other chemicals. During the course of the business, The 151

Accused -Respondent - Respondent Company (hereinafter referred to as the "151

Page 6 of 14

Respondent") purchased a stock of fertilizer imported by the Petitioner and payments were

made by way of cheques. As the practice of the said Company was purchasing fertilizer on

credit basis and three cheques were drawn by the I st Respondent in light of the aforesaid

transaction was dishonored when they were presented for payment. The Learned Magistrate

in his order dated 11 /08/2017 dismissed the action. Being aggrieved by the said order of the

Learned Magistrate, the Petitioner filed a revision application to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of the High Court of Colombo. The Learned High Court Judge by his order dated

07112/2018 dismissed the action on the basis that there was noncompliance with the

Appellate Court Rules. Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo, the Petitioner filed the instant Revision application in this Court seeking to revise

and set aside the said orders of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo and the Learned

Magistrate of Colombo.

GROUNDS OF THE REVISION APPLICATION

The following grounds were submitted and urged as the exceptional circumstances to invoke

the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court by the Learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner;-

a. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that there has not

been any miscarriage of justice to either party due to the mistake in

annexing the order of the Learned Magistrate.

b. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that Rule 3 of the

Supreme Court Rules is aimed at securing a full and complete

disclosure of facts of the case and that any error can be remedied in so

far as it does not prejudice the rights of the parties.

Page 7 of 14

c. The Learned High Court Jud,ge has failed to consider that the correct

order has been tendered to the Court subsequently and that there was

no fatal error or prejudice caused to the rights of the parties.

d. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the strict and

absolute compliance of the rules is not essential.

e. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the laid

down principle in interpreting the Rules of the Court that the Supreme

Court Rules too should be interpreted in a comparable manner.

The Learned Counsel for the Respondent raised a preliminary objection to this Revision

Application on the basis that the Petitioner has not complied with Rule 3(1) of the Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990, by failing to annex duly certified copies of the

relavent order and some of the documents to his petition which are material to this action. He

relies on the decisions in; H.C. Wickremasinghe and Others Vs H. Don Cyril Dissanayake

and Others CA 248/2007 decided on 20.01.2014, Sanmugavadivu Vs Kulathilake (2003)

Sri LR 215 and Urban Development Authority Vs Ceylon Entertainment Limited and

Others (2004) 1 Sri LR 95.

It was alleged that the impugned order of the Learned Magistrate of Colombo dated

11.08.2017 bearing the case number 39346/06/15 has not been produced with the Petition,

even if so pleaded in the Petition.

As the starting point to consider the argument of the learned Counsel on the Preliminary

Objection, [ set out below Rule 3(1 )(a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules

1990 (1990 Rules) as follows:

"If Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of powers vested in

Page 8 of 14

Petition, together with an affidavit in SUpport of the averments therein, and shall be

accompanied by the originals of documents material to such application (or duly

certified copies thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a Petitioner is unable to tender

any such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the leave of

Court to furnish such document later. Where a Petitioner fails to comply with the

provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mero motu or at the instance of any party,

dismiss such application".

The response of the learned counsel for the petitioner to the preliminary objection raised in

this instant case was based on two cases at the stage of the arguments. Those were

Singappu/i Arachchi/age Rumesh Sameera Dassanayake alias Gaminige Kolla Vs The

Honourable Attorney General SC SPL.LA.12S/2014, SC SPL.LA: 126/2014 and CA Writ

24817.

At this juncture it is important to elaborate the grounds on which the Supreme Court

overruled the preliminary objection of noncompliance with Rule 3 of the Supreme Court

Rules of 1990 in the case of Singappuli Arachchilage Rumesh Sameera Dassanayake alias

Gaminige Kolla Vs The Honourable Attorney General (Supra). In the aforementioned case

the learned Additional Solicitor General raised a preliminary objection based on

noncompliance with Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1990 on the ground that Rule 3

requires the petition to contain a plain and concise statement of all such facts and matters as

are necessary to enable the Supreme Court to determine whether special leave to appeal

should be granted. However in the above mentioned case the petitioners had, along with the

petitions, filed a copy of the entire original case record of the High Court inclusive of the

copies of the documentary evidence produced at the trial and as such the Supreme Court has

been provided with sufficient material and is not deprived to ascertain the facts and matters

Page 9 of 14

that would be necessary to detennine the issues. TJ:lerefore the Supreme Court overruled the

preliminary objection by the state in favour of the Petitioner.

In the case of H.C. Wickremasinghe and Others Vs H. Don Cyril Dissanayake and Others

(Supra), the Respondents raised a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the

application on the basis that the Petitioners have failed to comply with the mandatory

provisions of Rule 3(1) (a) & (b) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990

(Failure of the Petitioner to file material documents along with the application). Also one of

the documents which were made available to the court is a photocopy and the seal affixed

therein is hardly legible with the handwritten words 'true copy'. The Court was of the view

that the failure of the Petitioner to make available the entire set of proceedings gives rise to

certain doubts as regards the position taken up by the Petitioner and it is certainly not the

function of court to inquire as to whether the entirety of the proceedings is made available

and upheld the preliminary objection as follows;

"The position of the Respondents should not be dismissed by merely pointing the

finger to be highly technical. [t is not technical in the manner submitted by the

Petitioner. Noncompliance of the Appellate Procedure Rules would be fatal and [

uphold the preliminary objections of the Respondents and dismiss this

application ".

In the case of Sanmugavadivu Vs Kulathilake (Supra), the preliminary objection was upheld

by the Supreme Court on the basis that;

"In the instant case, the question in issue is with regard to Rules 3(1) (a) and 3(1) (b)

of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990. Rules 3(1) (a) and 3(1) (b)

unlike Rule 46 make provision for an applicant to purge his default and cure the

r/o for t A{' nn;nfpr/ flllt r /pnrlv in f,(iriwn'YItho'c r nr:o in f o rme Ilf Rulp dtl thprp wn(' nn '--")'------ r - " '---- -_ .. '---"' .1 ' . . - ... _-"--"._--- --- , .-.- ... _--J ------- -, ... _ . - -..

Page 10 of 14

provision Jor purging an applicant's deJau{t and the Court was oj the view that it

should 'first determine whether the deJault has been satisJactorily explained or cured

subsequently without unreasonable delay. , The new Rules permit an applicant to file

documents later, if he has stated his inability in filing the relevant documents along

with his application, and had taken steps to seek the leave oj the Court to furnish such

documents. In such circumstances, the only kind oj discretion that could be exercised

by Court is to see whether and how much time could be permitted Jor the filing oj

papers in due course. The appel/ant had made no such statements in her petition and

the Court oj Appeal had rightly decided that in the absence oJthe relevant documents,

the Court is "unable to exercise its revisionary powers in respect oj the order sought

to be revised" by the appel/ant ".

rn the case of Urban Development Authority Vs Ceylon Entertainment Limited and Others

(Supra), the Supreme Court upheld the Preliminary on the following rationale;

"11 has been urged that the order oj the District Courl which the petitioner sought to

have revised by Ihe Court oj Appeal resulted in a miscarriage oJjustice. In order to

decide that question, namely whether the answers to the interrogatories were filed

within the time stipulated by the District Court, it is necessary to consider the journal

entries in the original record maintained by the District Court. However 1 find that

the petitioner has Jailed to file in the Court oj Appeal duly certified copies (as

required by the Rule;,) oj such journal entries and the order oj the District Court

which are material to the revision application. In any event, in order to decide

whether the Court oj Appeal had considered the question whether the documents

(certified copies) which the petitioner had Jailed to file in the Court oj Appeal were

material to the application ... ...... "

Page 11 of 14

Therefore, in conclusion what distinguishes Sing,appuli Arachchilage Rumesh Sameera

Da5'sanayake alias Gaminige Kolla Vs The Honourable Attorney General (Supra) from the

other cited cases is that in the aforesaid case the entire case record of the High Court has been

submitted. As such the Court has been provided with sufficient material to entertain the

application even if the procedural rules are violated. If not the failure to produce material

documents is fatal.

Accordingly, after analysis of the relevant legal provisions and in light of the discussed long

line of decided authorities by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, the inevitable

conclusion that this Court shall arrive is that rules of procedure must not always be regarded

as mere technicalities which parties can ignore but non-compliance with rules is fatal to the

application. Parties who invoke the jurisdiction of this Court cannot ignore the Rules and it

could be permitted under special circumstances as in the above cited case.

Further, in the instant case, the Petitioner prayed from the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo to revise the Order of the Learned Magistrate of Colombo bearing case number

39346/06115 dated 11.08.2017. The Petitioner referred to the said order as X 21 annexed

along with the Petition made to the High Court. On the contrary, the document marked as X

21 is the Order of the Learned Magistrate of Colombo bearing number 39305/06 dated

11.08.2017. I am of the opinion that the Petitioner has not acted with due diligence. In light

of Rule 3 (I) (a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules an application should

accompany the originals or the certified copies of documents material to such application.

The response of the Petitioner to the preliminary objection raised at the High Court was that

there were two cases filed by the same complainant under two different cases before the

Magistrate's Court numbered 39305 and 39346 and they were verbatim except the case

number.

At this juncture my attention is drawn to the Page 574 of the Court of Appeal Brief, I wish to

reproduce the submission made by the Petitioner to the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo.

Therefore, I am of the view that it is fatal that if a petitioner who is seeking to revise a

particular order of a Magistrate Court has failed to provide the correct order which is material

to the action.

Also, I draw my attention to the submission made by the Petitioner on 12th February 2019 to

this court by way of a motion correcting the document marked as Pl G. Accordingly, the

document referred as PIG of Page 525 of the brief is the impugned order of the Learned

Magistrate Judge that the Petitioner is sought to revise. Nevertheless, it is observed that even

the said annexure is neither the original order nor a certified copy which is a direct violation

of Rule 3(1) (a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

Page 13 of 14

Furthennore, I observe that neither the entire case record is submitted to the Court nor an

application was made to produce such case record. Therefore, I am of the opinion that if a

Court of Law to interpret Appellate Procedure Rules in a less stringent manner and to

compensate a defect in light of justice, the parties has to provide sufficient material which

will not deprive the ascertainment the facts. In the case of Singappuli AracllcilUage Rumesll

Sameera Dassanayake alias Gaminige Kolla Vs The Honourable Attorney General

(Supra), a copy of the entire case record of the High Court inclusive of the copies of the

documentary evidence produced at the trial were produced and the Supreme Court has been

provided with sufficient material. Hence the facts of the instant case are different to the facts

of the case mentioned above. Therefore, the said case has no bearing and applicability to the

instant case.

In conclusion, this Court is of the view that the Petitioners submission as to the strict and

absolute compliance of the rules is not essential and that principle in interpreting the Rules of

the Supreme Court Rules should be comparable do not constitute exceptional circumstances

in the instance case.

In view of the above findings it is not necessary to look into the other grounds submitted by

the Petitioner.

Accordingly, the Revision Application is dismissed in limine. There will be no costs.
