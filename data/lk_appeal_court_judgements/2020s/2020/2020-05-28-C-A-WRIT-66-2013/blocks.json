In themselves, therefore, the judgment and the ratio are unexceptionable. What is put forward here as the most significant aspect of the case, however, is the principle stated in the italicised passage above on the general standard of fitness of new cars. On the face of it a car must be accepted as reasonably fit if it goes satisfactorily, as distinct from perfectly. Mechanical deficiencies of some sort are inevitable. But when a new vehicle immediately develops a number of very irritating defects such as a broken throttle cable, necessitating its return to the garage on 12 occasions with all the consequential loss and inconvenience, it might seem thereby to be so unsatisfactory as to be intolerable. Mr. Justice Croom-Johnsons dictum suggests clearly that he rejects this view and to that extent his judgment seems actually against the interests of consumers at large. If his remarks state the law correctly, then with respect it must be said that the law accepts depressingly and unnecessarily low standards of workmanship and performance.",
