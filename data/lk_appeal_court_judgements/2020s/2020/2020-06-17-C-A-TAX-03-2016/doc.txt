The Appellant is a Private Limited Liability Company incorporated and domiciled in Sri Lanka. Its

principal activity is the production of Coconut Shell Flour which is a fine powder manufactured

for the export market by grinding the coconut shells using a special machine. The raw material

used for this production is the coconut shell which the Appellant purchases from an associate

company called S.A. Silva & Sons Pvt. Ltd. dealing in the production of desiccated coconut.

The Appellant filed its tax returns for 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10 and 2010/11 and claimed tax

exemption for the profits of the above undertaking to produce Coconut Shell Powder. The

assessor rejected the returns on the ground that the coconut shell is not an agricultural produce

within the meaning of section 16(2)(a) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended (IRA

2006) and that the conversion of coconut shell into Coconut Shell Powder cannot be treated as

an exempt undertaking in terms of section 16 (2)(c) of the IRA 2006 since Coconut Shell Flour is

not gazetted by the Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue in terms that section.

The Appellant appealed to the Respondent who held that the assessments for the years 2007/08

and 2008/09 are time barred. However, the Respondent held that the assessments for the years

2009/10 and 2010/11 are valid and that the exemptions in sections 16(2)(b) and (c) of IRA 2006

is not available to the Appellant.

Aggrieved by this determination, the Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission (TAC)

which dismissed the appeal.

Upon the application of the Appellant, the TAC has forwarded this Case Stated to Court

containing the following questions of law:

(1) Whether the assessment issued for the year of assessment 2009/2010 is out of

time since it was not determined by the Tax Appeals Commission?

(2) Whether the assessment is not validly made in terms of section 163(3) of the

Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006?

Page 2 of 8

(3) Whether the production of coconut shell flour made out of coconut shells is an

agricultural produce in terms of section 16(2)(b) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10

of2006?

Time Bar of Assessment

The Appellant filed its income tax returns for the period 2009/10 on 30th November 2010. On or

around 2nd November 2012 the assessor issued an intimation letter under section 163(3) of IRA

2006. On or around 30th November 2012 the Respondent issued notice of assessment on the

Appellants for the year of assessment 2009/10.

The Appellant contends that in terms of section 106(1) of the IRA 2006 as originally enacted a

return must be filed on or before the 30th day of September immediately succeeding the end of

that year of assessment. Once a tax payer files a return on time, section 163(5) of the IRA 2006

as originally enacted prohibits an assessment being made after the expiry of eighteen months

from the end of that year of assessment.

Accordingly, if no change was made to the legal regime, the assessment of the Appellant for the

year of assessment 2009/10 should have been made on or before 30th September 2011.

However, section 163(5) of IRA 2006 was amended by the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No.

19 of 2009 and the words "thirtieth day of September" and "expiry of eighteen months" were

replaced with the words "thirtieth day of November" and "expiry of a period of two years"

respectively. This change in the legal regime was made well before the Appellant filed its return

for the year of assessment 2009/10 on 30th November 2010. The Appellant does not challenge

the application of this amendment to the instant case. Then the assessment should have been

made on or before 31" March 2012.

Yet, there was another amendment made to section 163(5) of the IRA 2006 by Inland Revenue

(Amendment) Act No. 22 of 2011 which came into effect from 1" April 2011, by which the words

"from the end of that year of assessment" with the words "from the thirtieth day of November

of the immediately succeeding year of assessment". Then the Respondent had time until 30th

November 2012.

Page 3 of8

However, the learned counsel for the Appellant contended that the 2011 amendment is

inapplicable to the year of assessment 2009/10 for at least two reasons. Firstly, that it was

brought into effect on 1" April 2011 which is the commencement of the year of assessment

2011/12 and thus giving a clear indication that it was sought to be made applicable from the year

of assessment 2011/2012 onwards. Secondly, it was submitted that at the time the Appellant

submitted the return on 30th November 2010 this was not applicable and therefore it will not

apply.

A similar issue arose some time ago when the amendment to the IRA 2006 in 2009 was the

subject matter in Seylan Bank PLC. v. The Commissioner General oj Inland Revenue [CA(Tax)

23/2013, C.A.M. 23.05.2015). In that case this Court held that irrespective of whether the

Assessee had to submit the tax return on or before the 30th September or 30th November 2009,

the Assessor can send the assessment to the Assessee within two years immediately succeeding

that year of Assessment. The Court further considered the amendments made to section 163 of

IRA 2006 by Act Nos. 22 of 2011, 18 of 2013 and 8 of 2014. It held that the two-year period given

to the Assessor to send the assessment against the Assessee was to start from the end of the

year of assessment originally, which is the 31" of March, every year. This date (the starting day

ofthe period) has been further pushed down to the thirtieth day of November of the immediately

succeeding year of assessment by Act No. 22 of 2011. The Court also held that section 163(5) of

IRA 2006 is a procedural law and that even if the amendment has retrospective effect, it applies,

if the amendment is only on procedural law.

Two judges sitting together as a ru le follow the decision of two judges. Where two judges sitting

together find themselves unable to follow a decision of two judges, the practice in such cases is

also to reserve the case for the decision of a fuller bench [Walker Sons & Co. (UK) Ltd. v.

Gunatilake and others (1978-79-80) 1 Sri. L.R. 231). In any event, I am of the view that the

reasoning in Seylan Bank PLC. v. The Commissioner General oj Inland Revenue (supra) is sound

and compelling and sets out the correct position of the law.

Page40f8

In any event, in my view, the time bar in Section 163(5)(a) of the IRA is procedural. In A.G. v.

Vernazza [(1960) 3 AII.E.R. 97 at 100] it was held that if the new act effects matter of procedure

only, then prima facie, it applies to all actions, pending as well as future. This was reiterated in

Blyth v. Blyth [(1966) 1 AII.E.R. 524 at 535] where Lord Denning held that the rule that an act of

Parliament is not to be given retrospective effect does not apply to statutes which only alters the

form of procedure.

The only remaining issue is whether the assessment was made on or before 30th November 2012.

It is observed that the intimation letter under section 163(3) of IRA 2006 is dated 2nd November

2012.

Section 163(3) of IRA 2006 requires the assessor to inform the person who submitted the return

the reasons for not accepting his return. Such intimation is possible only after the Assessor makes

an Assessment.

The distinction between the "Assessment" and "Notice of Assessment" has been clearly

recognized in Commissioner of Income Tax vs. Chettinad Corporation Ltd. (55 N.L.R. 553 at 556)

where Gratiaen J. held:

"The distinction between an Assessment" and a "notice of assessment" is thus made

clear: the former is the departmental computation of the amount of tax with which a

particular Assessee is considered to be chargeable, and the latter is the formal intimation

to him of the fact that such an assessment has been made."

This was quoted with approval by the present Court of Appeal in Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue [(1981) 2 Sri. L.R. 78].

Although Commissioner of Income Tox v. Chettinad Corporation Ltd. (supra) was decided upon a

consideration of the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance No.2 of 1932 as amended

the distinction made therein between "assessment" and "notice of assessment" has been

maintained in the 2006 Act.

Page 5 of8

In fact, Samarakoon c.J. in D.M.S. Fernando and onother vs. Ismail [(1982) 1 Sri. l.R. 222 at 228)

held:

"The Assessment so made in terms of section 93(2) must be followed by a Notice of

Assessment in terms of section 95. That is the first time that the Assessee is apprised of

the estimated income and taxa ble wealth and he must then know the reasons for non-

acceptance of his return . It appears to me therefore that the duty to communicate

reasons can be discharged by sending the reasons simultaneously with the Notice of

Assessment."

Since the intimation letter under section 163(3) of IRA 2006 is dated 2nd November 2012 clearly

the assessment was made at or before that and therefore the assessment for the year 2009/10

is not time barred.

Validity af Assessment

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that the intimation letter issued under section

163(3) of the IR Act by the Assessor has merely reproduced the section 16 of IRA 2006 and states

that coconut shell flour is not "any agricultural produce as mentioned in (a) and (b) of the above".

It is submitted that this communication is invalid in law.

All what section 163(3) of IRA 2006 requires is for the assessor to intimate to the person

submitting the return, reasons for not accepting the return. It is observed that the Appellant did

not in the return declare the reasons for seeking the exemption. The Assessor has on the available

information concluded that the Appellant is seeking an exemption in terms of section 16(3)(c) of

the IR Act. The Assessor has given an adequate indication to the Appellant as to the reasons why

the return has been rejected thus satisfying the requirements in section 163(3) of IRA 2006

[Gunaratne v. Joyawardane and Others (Sri Lanka Tax Cases Vol. IV page 246)].

Page 6 of8

Section 16 (2) (b) 0/ IRA 2006

Section 16 of IRA 2006 as amended by Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 19 of 2009 reads:

"(1) The profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 3, other

than any profits and income from the disposal of any capital asset, of any person

or partnership from any agricultural undertaking carried on in Sri Lanka, shall be

exempt from income tax for each year of assessment within the period of five

years, commencing on April 1, 2006.

(2) In this section "agricultural undertaking" means -

(a) an undertaking for the purpose of the production of any agricultural,

horticultural or any diary produce;

(b) an undertaking for the cleaning, sizing, sorting, grading, chilling, dehydrating,

packaging, cutting, canning for the purpose of changing the form, contour or

physical appearance of any produce referred to in paragraph (a), in preparation of

such produce for the market; or

(c) any undertaking for the conversion of any produce referred to in paragraph (a)

into such product as may be specified by the Commissioner-General, by Order

published in the Gazette."

The analysis must begin by ascertaining the scope of section 16(2)(a) of IRA 2006 which in my

view must be given a wide meaning and will cover any agricultural, horticultural or any diary

produce. One cannot qualify it as any primary agricultural produce. In using the word ony, the

legislature has given a clear indication that it intended to provide for a wider application.

Section 16(2) (c) of IRA 2006 is specific to products which are produced by conversion of any

produce referred to in sub-section 16(2) (a) of IRA 2006 into another product. What is

contemplated is a conversion of one product into another product. Examples are Yoghurt and

curd which requires a process of conversion to be made to milk. Such products qualify for tax

Page 7of8

exemption only if gazetted in terms of this sub-section. In this situation, the conversion process

changes the character of the produce in sub-section 16(2) (a) of IRA 2006 into another product.

In my view what is envisaged in sub-section 16 (2) (b) of IRA 2006 is a situation where the produce

referred to in section 16(2) (a) therein retains its character even after the acts referred to section

16 (2) (b) therein are performed. This becomes clear when one considers the words "for the

purpose of changing the form, contour or physical appearance of any produce referred to in

paragraph (a), in preparation of such praduce for the market".

The Appellant grinds coconut shells and makes coconut shell flour which is a different product to

the coconut shell. Therefore, in my opinion coconut shell flour is not an exempt item in terms of

section 16 (2) (b) of IRA 2006.

For the foregoing reasons, we answer the questions of law as follows:

(1) Whether the assessment issued for the year of assessment 2009/2010 is out of

time since it was not determined by the Tax Appeals Commission? No.

(2) Whether the assessment is not validly made in terms of section 163(3) of the

Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006? No.

(3) Whether the production of coconut shell flour made out of coconut shells is an

agricultural produce in terms of section 16(2)(b) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10

of 2006? No.

For the reasons aforesaid, this Court confirms the Determination of the TAe.

The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment to the TAe.
