The Appellant, Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority

(SLTDA) Iiled this application in the Magistrates Court of Kuchchaveli in terms

of Section 5 (I) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 (as

amended), (hereinafter referred to as the Act), to eject Ganeshapillei Kalipillai (the

Respondent in the instant Case) and Ganeshapillei Sameswaran (the Respondent in

Case No. PHC-0142-15), from lots lA, 18 and IC in Plan No. 2946 dated

31105/2005, made by A.M.S. Attanayakc, licensed surveyor described more fully

Page 2 of 10

in the schedule to the application. The schedules in both applications filed in the

Magistrates Court by the Appellant to eject the respective Respondents are

identical. Therefore, of consent, written and oral submissions of Counsel were

made to cover both applications.

The Respondent took up the position that, she is the owner of the land in

issue by virtue of Deed of Declaration No. 155 dated 24/06/2005. Taking into

consideration the said Deed of Declaration, the learned Magistrate made order

dismissing the Appellant's application stating that the said land is not a state land

but a private land and therefore, the Respondent is not liable to be ejected from the

land as she is in possession of the land by a legally executed Deed. Being

aggrieved by the said order the Appellant filed a revision application in High

Court of the Eastern Province, holden in Trincomalee, where the learned High

Court Judge dismissed the said application on the basis that, the Appellant had no

authority to institute action, since the Board or Directors had not delegated such

powers to the Chairman of the SLTDA, (as competent Authority) to file this

application. The Appellant is before this Court to have the said judgment set aside.

The following grounds of appeal have been raised by the Appellant: -

I) Did the learned Magistrate erroneously hold that the land in dispute is a

private land and therefore, the Respondent was entitled to possess the land?

2) Has the learned Magistrate erred in law by deciding that the person to

whom summons was served could establish possession or occupation in any

other manner than producing a valid permit issued by the State.

Page 3 of 10

3) Has the learned High Court Judge erred in law in coming to the conclusion

that the Chairman of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority had [10

power to file an application for eviction as 'competent authority' under the

Act?

Section 6 of the Act requIres the Magistrate to issue summons on the

person named in the application 'to appear and show cause' why such person and

his dependants, if any, should not be ejected from the land as prayed for in the

application.

"A person who has been summoned in terms of section 6 of the Act can only

establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or

other written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid. " (Nirmal Paper Converters (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Sri Lallka Ports

Authority (1993) 1 S.L.R. 219)

Section 9 of the Act reads thus;

(I) At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has been served

shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under

section 5 except that such person may establish that he is in possession or

occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the

State granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or

authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid.

Page 4 of 10

. '

(2) It shall not be competent to the Magistrate's Court to call for any evidence from

the competent authority in support of the application under Section 5.

Within the meaning of Section 9( I) of the Act, the burden is on the

Respondent to establish that she is in possession upon a valid permit or the written

authority of the State (Urban Development Authority Vs. Wejayaluxmi (2006) 3

SLR 62)

The Respondent claims title to the land in question by Deed of Declaration

No. 155, dated 24/06/2005, and states that the provisions of the Act would not

apply against a privately owned land and therefore, the competent authority could

ejeet only such person in possession or occupation of such land belonging to the

State. The Respondent further claims that she acquired title to the said land by

Deed of Transfer No. 6296 dated 26/04/1978, (Vide page 101 of the brief).

However, it is observed that the said Deed has no relevance to the claim put

forward by the Respondent. [n any event if the Respondent is claiming title by

virtue of the said Deed, in terms of Section 12 of the Act, the Respondent could

file a civil action against the State to vind icate her title.

[n SC Appeal 214/12, decided on 27/06/2013, Sri Pavan J. (as he then was)

cited with approval the case of /halapathiranu Vs. Bulankulame, (1988) 1 SLR

416, where S.N. Silva J. (as he then was) observed;

"The mere fact that such a civil action is possible does not have the effect of

placing the land described in the notice marked 'P3', outside the purview of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. Indeed, in all instances where a person

Page 5 of 10

is in unauthorized occupation or possession of State Land such person could ,be

ejected from the land in an appropriate civil action. The clear object of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is to secure possession of such land by an

expeditious machinery without recourse to an ordinary civil action. "

The position taken up by the Appellant is that by Deed of Transfer No.

6296, dated 26/04/1978, the land in question which belonged to one Leslie Edward

Barwick was acquired by the State in terms of the Land Acquisition Act No. 28 of

1964 (as amended), on 05/0111980 as reflected in Gazette Notification bearing No.

91/7 dated 05/06/1980, and the supporting documents filed of record. (Vide page

, 84 to 92 of the brief). The Grama Niladari, of Nilaweli in his statement to the

police (Vide Page 114 of the brief in PHC-0 142-15) states;

q'lc:J dt/o8eJ Bf) zf3eJo j2JJJt!bf) f:i)ltJ oe1@e1 @ef8f:i)~eJ8d 25J[eJtJJ zf3eJod oC;~ Gd

This clearly shows that the Respondent did not possess a valid pennit or

any authority to be in possession or occupation of the said land. The Respondent

has relied heavily on the Deed of Declaration which she contends has given her a

legitimate reason to be in possession of the land. It is trite law that such

consideration is not within the scope of the Act.

Page 6 of 10

In SC Appeal 214112, decided on 2710612013, (Supra) Sri favan J. (~s he

then was) observed;

"The State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act was initially enacted on

2510111979 in order to make provision for the recovery of possession of "State

Lands" from persons in unauthorized possession or occupation of the said lands.

Thus, it is obvious that the intention of the legislature was to obtain an order of

ejectment from the Magistrate's Court when the occupation or possession was

unauthorized ....

Thus, one could see that a limitation has been placed on the scope and ambit of

the inquiry before the Magistrate. The Magistrate can only satisfo him whether a

valid permit or any other written authority of the State has been granted to the

person on whom summons has been served If the language of the enactment is

clear and unambiguous, it would not be legitimate for the Courts to add words by

implication into the language. It is a settled law of interpretation that the words

are to be interpreted as they appear in the provision, simple and grammatical

meaning is to be given to them, and nothing can be added or subtracted. The

Courts must construe the words as they find it and cannot go outside the ambit of

the section and speculate as to what the legislature intended An interpretation of

Section 9 which defeats the intent and purpose for which it was enacted should be

avoided"

"

[n Mlihandiram Vs. Chairman, Janatha Estate Development Board

(1992) 1 SLR 110, it was held that;

"In an inquiry under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, the onus is on

the person summoned to establish his possession or occupation that it is possessed

or occupied upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted

according to any written law, if this burden is not discharged, the only option

open to the Magistrate is to order ejectment",

In the circumstances, it is very clear that, in the instant case the Respondent

has failed to discharge her burden in terms of the Act to establish possession or

occupation, To the contrary, it is well founded that the land in issue is a State land

and also that the Respondent has no legally valid permit or any other written

authority to contest any matter stated in the application filed in terms of Section 5

of the Act. The Respondent has not produced any valid permit or any written

authority of the state granted in accordance with any written law in force to

possess or occupy the said land. Therefore, the Respondent has clearly failed to

comply with the notice to quit and vacate the land in issue and therefore, is liable

to be ejected.

The next argument placed before Court by the learned Counsel for the

Respondent is that the person making the application to Court is not a competent

authority in terms of the Act. This objection is based on the fact that the Board of

Directors of SL TDA did not delegate such powers to the Chairman to file this

application, At the outset, it is observed that according to the Tourism Act No. 38

Page 8 of 10

, .

of 2005, which established the SL TDA, does not compose of a Board of Directors.

The land in question was vested with the State by Gazette Notification bearing No.

91/7, dated 05/06119S0. The 'Quit notice' was issued by thc Chairmen of SL TDA

as competent authority in terms of Section 3 of the Act.

Section IS of the Act states thus;

"Competent authority" used in relation to any land means the Government Agent,

an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant Government Agent of the district

in which the land is situated and, includes,

Sec. IS (h) of the Act states thus: -

"The head of any other Government Department or Institution being a department

or institution created by law, where such land is under the control of such

department or institution "

Therefore, delegation of powcr from the members of the authority to the

Chairman to act as competent authority would not arise since the Chairman as the

head of the authority has every right to make this application to Court in terms of

Section 18(h) of the Act.

The Appellant as the head of the said statutory authority has filed this

application. Therefore, the argument that the Appellant as competent authority has

no power to file this application is totally misplaced in law.

Page 9 of 10

It is also observed that the scope of the inquiry in term~ of Section 9 ofithe

Act specifically states that the leamed Magistrate is not competent to call for any

evidence from the competent authority in support of an application in writing set

out in the schedule to the Act. It is well settled law that an objection of this nature

cannot be taken up before thc learned Magistrate or in these proceedings.

However, an aggrieved party could challenge the decision of the competent

authority under Section 3 of the Act by way of a writ of certiorari. (Dayananda

VS. r ltalwalle (2001) 2 SLR 73). Therefore, I see no merit in this argument.

i For the aforesaid reasons, the judgment of the learned High Court Judge

and the order of the learned Magistrate are set aside.

Application allowed.
