Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners filed this application mainly seeking to quash by

a writ of certiorari the Board resolution of the 1st Respondent

Sampath Bank PLC dated 26.03.2020 (P13A), whereby the Bank

resolved to recover the dues from the 1st Petitioner to the Bank

by selling the mortgaged property, in terms of the provisions of

the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act, No.4 of

1990, as amended. The two Mortgage Bonds executed as

collaterals are No.1365 (P3) and No.1746 (P6) in respect of the

same property, the former being a primary mortgage and the

latter being a secondary mortgage. In paragraph 12 of the

petition, the Petitioners accept the execution of P3, but in

paragraph 26, deny P6 as having been fraudulently executed

without their consent. The public auction, which was to be held

on 14.08.2020 pursuant to the said resolution, was halted by an

interim order of this Court.

In paragraph 32 of the petition, the Petitioners accept having

obtained two loan facilities from the Bank in a sum of Rs.50

million but state they never defaulted on the payment.

The position of the Bank is that the Petitioners did default on

the payment and, therefore, at the request of the Petitioners

(1R1), the Bank rescheduled the monies due from the

Petitioners, as seen from the offer letter 1R2 dated 13.09.2018,

the conditions of which were accepted by the Petitioners. In

addition, the Petitioners entered into two loan agreements 1R3A

and 1R3B. The bank statement 1R4 for the month of September

2018 relevant to the account of the 1st Petitioner shows monies

5

being credited to the said account upon the rescheduling of the

facilities. The secondary mortgage P6 dated 13.09.2018 was

signed by the Petitioners as collateral in terms of the offer letter

1R2 vide page 2 of 1R2 under COLLATERAL FOR FACILITY 01

& 03. Three loan facilities were agreed to be rescheduled by

1R2, and relevant to the instant matter are facilities 1 and 3.

The Petitioners say, in view of the Banks own documents 1R2

and the letters compendiously marked 1R7, the Petitioners were

not in arrears at the time the Board resolution was passed, in

that 1R2 allows a grace period of 6 months to make payments

on the rescheduling of facilities and 1R7 says there were no

arrears of installments. But according to 1R2, the grace period

is for the principal amount and not the interest component.

This is made clear by inter alia conditions 4, 5, 7 of the loan

agreements 1R3A and 1R3B. Condition 7 further says that in

the event of a default, repayment of the full loan shall be deemed

to be in default. It is not the case of the Petitioners that the

interest component was paid during the grace period as agreed.

According to the resolution statement 1R9, not a single

installment of the loan repayment has been made.

It is interesting to note that both directors of the 1st Petitioner

company (the 2nd Petitioner and his wife) have signed the above

documents, almost on each and every page, and they do not say

their signatures were forged. The 2nd Petitioners position is that

the 14th Respondent, who is the present Manager of the

Thalahena branch of the Sampath Bank, and the Attorney-at-

Law who executed the secondary Mortgage Bond P6, got his and

his wifes signatures on several unfilled pre-printed formats and

6

blank papers and later manufactured the documents referred to

above to falsely manifest the rescheduling of the loan facilities.

This is a very serious allegation that is flatly denied by the Bank.

Regarding the Mortgage Bond P6, however, the 2nd Petitioner in

P7G says the Bank enticed me to sign a security of a mortgage

and not that the Bank manufactured the secondary Mortgage

Bond unknown to him.

The Petitioners would appreciate that if the said documents

tendered by the Bank with its statement of objections were in

fact consciously signed by them and they thereafter defaulted on

the payments, they cannot complain about the Board resolution

passed.

This leads me to the irresistible conclusion that major facts are

in dispute and therefore the writ Court lacks the jurisdiction

and ability to pass judgment on this matter. The writ Court is

not a trial Court to decide the veracity of conflicting assertions of

rival parties. Although I can conveniently stop here and dismiss

the application, let me add the following, as the Petitioners

thought it fit to bring this matter before this Court.

According to the documents tendered by the 2nd Petitioner

himself, he is not an illiterate person. He is well-educated,

having the qualification of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from a

foreign university (P1D). He is also a businessman. He is not a

novice and has obtained loan facilities from the 1st Respondent

Bank previously.

As a general rule, if a signatory to a document is an adult who is

neither illiterate nor blind, he shall take full responsibility for

7

the contents thereof. He cannot disavow or disown the document

he admittedly signed when he later realises it is unfavourable to

him. If he signs blank documents, he does so at his own peril.

This may be subject to limited exceptions.

Professor Weeramantry, in his celebrated work The Law of

Contracts, states at page 300 of Vol I:

A person signing a document is held strictly to its terms on

the basis that he does so at his peril. This is known as the

caveat subscriptor rule, and in the operation of this rule the

principles relating to Justus error come into play. This rule

must not however be viewed as a special head of exemption

from the ordinary rules relating to mistake. Where a person

deliberately affixes his signature to a written contract, the

court would naturally be more hesitant in permitting him to

plead that he did so in consequence of a mistake as to the

nature or substance of the transaction, and to this extent

would be less prone to view the error as Justus.

In accordance with the rules of Justus error the court would

not readily come to the aid of a person who states that he

did not sufficiently attend to the terms of a contract or did

not read it sufficiently carefully, or altogether neglected to

read the document containing the contract. Thus where a

person who is neither illiterate nor blind signs a deed

without examining its contents, he would not, as a general

rule, be permitted in Roman-Dutch Law to set up the plea

that the document is not his. If, however, without

negligence, a person executes a document in ignorance of

8

its true nature, he may repudiate it, and this repudiation

holds good even as against third persons who have in good

faith acted upon it as a genuine expression of intention.

This statement of law was quoted with agreement in Mercantile

Credit Ltd v. Thilakaratne [2002] 3 Sri LR 206 at 211-212.

In Jayawardena v. Piyaratne [2004] 1 Sri LR 37, the Defendant

admitted signing the indentures of Lease, but stated he was

unaware of the contents therein. This Court rejected this

argument and stated at page 47:

The evidence of the Defendant-Respondent that the

contents of P1 and P4 were not explained to him and as

such he did not know the contents cannot be believed. It

has been held in Saunders v. Anglia Building Society [1970]

3 All ER 961 that a plea of non-est factum, will rarely

succeed if the document was signed by an adult or a

literate person.

The Petitioners have also tendered some email correspondence

P7A-H. In this email correspondence, the Talahena Bank

Manager refers to the rescheduling of the loans and gives a

detailed description of the then prevailing status of the

Petitioners account. But the Petitioners did not reply any of

these emails denying the rescheduling of the facilities with their

concurrence. This is not the usual behaviour of a prudent

person. Any prudent person in such circumstances would have

immediately reacted and denied such an occurrence. The email

P7G was sent by the 2nd Petitioner to his Counsel and not to the

Bank.

9

After the rescheduling, the Bank had sent several letters (1R7)

reminding the Petitioners of the default on payment (of the

interest component) but the Petitioners remained silent.

In December 2018, the Petitioners wrote to the Bank through an

Attorney-at-Law (1R8) asking for details of their accounts, but

even in this letter there is no denial of the rescheduling of the

facilities.

I must emphasise that the pivotal issue in the instant

application is the rescheduling of the banking facilities by the

present Bank Manager. The impugned Board resolution P13A is

based on this rescheduled facility.

In business matters, if the party receiving a letter, email or the

like disputes the assertions contained in it, he must reply, for

failure to do so can be regarded as an admission of the claims

made therein.

In the oft quoted decision of Saravanamuttu v. de Mel (1948) 49

NLR 529, it was held:

In business matters, if a person states in a letter to another

that a certain state of facts exists, the person to whom the

letter is written must reply if he does not agree with or

means to dispute the assertions. Otherwise, the silence of

the latter amounts to an admission of the truth of the

allegations contained in that letter.

The following dicta of Lord Esher M.R. in Wiedeman v. Walpole

(1891) 2 Q.B. 534 was quoted with approval in Colombo Electric

10

Tramways and Lighting Co. Ltd v. Pereira (1923) 25 NLR 193 at

195:

Now there are casesbusiness and mercantile casesin

which the Courts have taken notice that, in the ordinary

course of business, if one man of business states in a letter

to another that he has agreed to do certain things, the

person who receives that letter must answer it, if he means

to dispute the fact that he did so agree. So, where

merchants are in dispute one with the other in the course of

carrying on some business negotiations, and one writes to

the other, but you promised me that you would do this or

that, if the other does not answer that letter, but proceeds

with the negotiations, he must be taken to admit the truth of

the statement.

The above has been quoted with approval in several cases,

including Seneviratne v. LOLC [2006] 1 Sri LR 230.

However, I must hasten to add that failure to reply alone cannot

decide the whole case. In the words of Justice Weeramantry in

Wickremasinghe v. Devasagayam (1970) 74 NLR 80 at 93:

although the failure to reply to this letter is a circumstance which

may be urged against the defendant, it cannot by itself prove the

plaintiff's case.

The Petitioners in paragraphs 18-21 of the petition state they

noticed some unusual activity in their bank accounts in or

around July 2018 but when they made inquiries about it from

the 13th Respondent, who was the former Manager of the

11

Thalahena branch of the Bank, he attributed it to a system

error.

The Petitioners main complaint is that the former Manager of

the Bank fraudulently misused the funds in their accounts for

his personal gain without their knowledge and, upon the

Petitioners making a complaint on 08.10.2018, the former

Manager was arrested and produced before the Magistrates

Court and remanded for 14 days.

The Petitioners say the Magistrates Court ordered a forensic

audit and in the resultant Report (P11) it was found that the

former Manager being an agent of the Bank had acted in a

fraudulent manner with intent to defraud the Petitioners. The

Petitioners say large sums of monies were withdrawn/overdrawn

from their accounts by the former Manager without their

consent. In the said context, it is the contention of the

Petitioners that the resolution passed without consideration of

the Forensic Audit Report P11 is mala fide, ultra vires and bad

in law.

The allegation against the former Manager of the Bank is not

directly relevant to the impugned resolution. The resolution is

based on the rescheduling of the then existing facilities,

subsequent to the alleged misuse of funds by the former

Manager. The rescheduling of the facilities in September 2018 is

a separate transaction/agreement (in practical terms entered

into between the Petitioners and the present Manager on behalf

of the Bank). This created a new contract in substitution of the

former contract. In other words, by rescheduling the

12

outstanding facilities, a new debt was created in place of the

existing debt with new terms. In the law of contracts, this is

known as novation proper. Professor Weeramantry in the

same treatise (The Law of Contracts, Vol II) says at page 753:

Where there is a novation of a contract, there comes into

existence in the eye of the law a new and independent contract.

This proposition of law was acknowledged in the Supreme Court

case of Hatton National Bank Limited v. Rumeco Industries

Limited [2011] 2 BLR 329.

Although the Petitioners say the former Manager allegedly

misappropriated large sums of money from the Petitioners, this

does not seem to be entirely correct. According to the summary

of the findings of the Forensic Audit Report (page 12 of P11B),

there had been 23 questionable transactions and of them only

four transactions were not cleared.

19 (approx.) out of 23 transactions claimed by Dr.

Weerasinghe [the 2nd Petitioner] are cleared to an extent

where the money has been returned subject to few

exceptions. The balance four transactions, totaling Rs.

12,166,000/=, out of the 23 were not cleared as to whether

same amount has been returned.

Regarding the rescheduling of the facilities, the Forensic Audit

Report states at page 23:

4 credit facilities under Dr. Weerasinghe were rescheduled

on 14th Sep 2018. Total value of these credit facilities were

Rs.109 Mn (Approx). Even though Dr. Weerasinghe has

claimed that his signatures were fraudulently obtained by

13

current branch manageress of Sampath Bank Talahena

Branch, several documentary evidence was available in the

credit files provided by Sampath Bank to substantiate that

Dr. Weerasinghe was aware and agreed to obtain credit

facilities from the Bank. The said evidence includes Board

Resolution extracts of board of directors of K.A.S. Auto

International (Pvt) Ltd, request letters, applications,

agreements, receipts etc.

In view of a news article, the 16th Respondent Central Bank of

Sri Lanka, acting in terms of its statutory powers derived from

the Monetary Law Act and the Banking Act, conducted a spot

examination through the Bank Supervision Department of the

Central Bank regarding the instant issue and compiled the

Report 17R3. The conclusion of the said Report is, in my view,

not in favour of the Petitioners:

12.1 There is inadequate evidence to ascertain that the fund

transfers and cheque encashments were initiated without

the customers knowledge due to the following reasons:

i. The customer had received monthly statements for the

personal/business current accounts and SMS alerts for

the withdrawals from his personal current account;

ii. Since the alleged transactions are of high value, those

transactions would have come to the notice of the

customer;

iii. The customer has complained about the suspicious

transactions occurred during the period from

14

06.02.2017 to 30.01.2018, only after a lapse of 9

months;

iv. The customer does not deny that the signatures placed

on the fund transfer requests and cheques were placed

by him (as informed by the CID officer in charge of the

investigation). To the naked eye, the customers

signature placed on the vouchers of the alleged

transactions were similar to the specimen on the

relevant mandates; and

v. The customer has placed signatures on the reversal of

the cheques of the alleged cheque encashments and

the customer has signed the alteration in the fund

transfer request (Rs.2,500,000 dated 30.06.2017).

12.2 The conduct of the manager is questionable since, as per

the draft Internal Audit Report of the bank, Mr. Manoj

Rodrigo has provided financial assistance though his

personal funds to certain customers using his wifes

account, which seems unusual and questionable.

12.3 Currently, the investigations are in progress and the

matter is before the Court of law.

As I stated at the outset, the major facts are in dispute in the

instant matter. After the institution of this application in this

Court, the Petitioners have, in my view, rightly filed two actions

in the Commercial High Court, CHC/167/2020/MR and

CHC/168/2020/MR, seeking in effect the identical reliefs and

further reliefs. The Petitioners may pursue their substantive

grievances through those cases.

15

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the

Petitioners but without costs.
