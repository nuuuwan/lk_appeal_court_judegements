Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is a company established in the Islamic Republic of Iran and duly registered in Sri

Lanka as an overseas company in terms of the Companies Act NO.7 of 2007. The Petitioner was

awarded the Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract for the Uma Oya Multipurpose

Development Project. The Petitioner engaged the services of individuals directly and non-directly,

through subcontractors, to carry out the wok of the project.

The 2nd Respondent was directly engaged by the Petitioner for the said project at the

Bandarawela Branch Office of th e Petitioner. By letter dated 03.09.2013 (P12) the services of the

2nd Respondent was terminated which inter alia, reads:

"as previously discussed, you are hereby informed that with effect from 01-Sep-2013 we

handed over all our local staff to the Manpower Service according to our company policy.

Therefore, your employment/services for Farab Company are terminated with effect from

31-Aug-2013".

The 2nd Respondent complained to the 1" Respondent (P14) that his services were terminated

contrary to the provisions of the Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions)

Act as amended (Act). The 1" Respondent initiated an inquiry at the end of which order dated

10.06.2014 wrongly dated as 10.06.2013 (P17) was made where it was held that the termination

of services of the 2nd Respondent was done contrary to the Act and ordered that the 2nd

Respondent be reinstated with payment of back wages with effect from 01.07.2014.

The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari quashing the said order as it is claimed to be

"unreasonable, irrational, arbitrary, malicious and illegal and ultra vires" the Act.

In terms of section 2(1) of the Act:

"No employer shall terminate the scheduled employment of any workman without-

(a) the prior consent in writing of the workman; or

(b) the prior written approval ofthe Commissioner"

There is no dispute that the 2nd Respondent did not give prior consent in writing for his

termination. The Petitioner rel ies on a purported approval granted by the Commissioner.

The Petitioner places much reliance on documents marked P9 and P10 to establish that the 1"

Respondent Commissioner gave "prior written approval" for the termination of the services of

the 2nd Respondent. These two documents are titled "Termination of Farab company with

Employee" and contains details of employees of the Petitioner including the amount received by

them as compensation. The Petitioner contends that this was consequent to an application made

by the Petitioner to the 1" Respondent seeking his approval for the termination. In particular the

Petitioner relies on the note made by the 5th Respondent thereon stating that the payments were

made in the Haputale District Labour Office. The issue is whether this indicates that the 1"

Respondent has given prior written approval for the termination of the services of the Petitioner

in terms of the Act.

Before considering the facts of this case I wish to advert to the Supreme Court decision in Lanka

Multi Moulds (Pvtj Ltd. v. Wimalasena, Commissioner of Labour and Others [(2003) 1 Sri.L.R. 137J

where it was held that "prior consent" required by section 2(1 )(a) of the Act need not necessarily

be contained in a single sheet of paper. It could be inferred from the attendant circumstances in

each case. I am of the view that the same rationa le is applicable to the written approval of the 1"

Respondent in terms of section 2(1)(b) of the Act.

Page 3 of 6

I will now examine whether the attendant circumstances of this case show that such an approval

has been given by the 1st Respondent.

Section 2(2)(a) of the Act states that approval may be given by the Commissioner on an

application made in that behalf by such employer, a copy of which application shall be served on

the workman concerned, who shall be afforded an opportunity of being heard.

In this context one must bear in mind that section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance states that the

court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being

had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business in

their relation to the facts of the particular case. Illustration (d) therein states that the court may

presume that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed. I see no reason to consider

that that the 1st Respondent may have acted otherwise in relation to granting permission to

terminate the services of the Petitioner. Therefore, if the assertion of the Petitioner is true that

the 1st Respondent did give his prior written approval, there should be an application by the

Petitioner and a copy of that should have been served on the 2nd Respondent and he should have

been heard. However, neither the Petitioner nor the 1" to 3,d and 5th Respondents have

submitted any documentation to Court indicating that the Petitioner made such an application

and the workman were given an opportunity of being heard.

Furthermore, section 2(2)(d) requires the Commissioner to give notice in writing of his decision

on the application to both the employer and the workman. In this situation too section 114 of the

Evidence Ordinance applies. However, neither the Petitioner nor the 1st to 3,d and 5th

Respondents have submitted any documentation to Court which evinces of a decision of the

Commissioner in writing.

In this context it is important to point out that at the inquiry (P16) conducted into the complaint

made by the 2nd Respondent (P14) about his unlawful termination, the Petitioner did not take up

the position that the termination was consequent to written approval obtained from the 1"

Respondent. In the written submissions signed by Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner (Respondent

at the inquiry) it is stated that "at all times material to the employment of the employees they

were made to understand that there was no permanency in their employment" and that "Farab

decided to hand over its functions to a contractor since they were unable to continue with its

employees".

Page 4 of 6

In fact, by letter dated 17 Aug 2013 (P7) the Petitioner informed the 1st Respondent that if the

workers refuse to adopt the strategy of the Petitioner, which was to hand over the workman to

a Manpower Company, the Petitioner would be terminating their contracts of employment.

Nothing is mentioned about an application made to the 1st Respondent seeking his written

approval for the termination.

In the aforesaid circumstances, it is not possible to concluded that the written approval of the 1st

Respondent was obtained for the termination of the services of the 2nd Respondent.

Yet the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the endorsements made by

the 5th Respondent on P9 and P10 that the compensation was paid before him amounts to "prior

written approval" of the 1st Respondent.

The power given in section 2 of the Act is vested with the Commissioner General of Labour. It is

so specifically stated. Section 19 of the Act states that in the Act, unless the context otherwise

requires "Commissioner" means the person for the time being holding the office of the

Commissioner of Labour. The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that

practical considerations require the term "Commissioner" to include officials such as the 5th

Respondent. Such an interpretation is possible since section 11 of the Act states that the

Commissioner may delegate to any officer of the Labour Department any power, function or duty

conferred or imposed on him under his Act. However, no such delegation of power has been

submitted to this Court by either the Petitioner or the 1st Respondent. Accordingly, it is not

possible for this Court in these proceedings to conclude that the 5th Respondent can exercise the

powers of the Commissioner in terms of section 2 of the Act.

In Lonka Multi Moulds (Pvt) Ltd. v. Wimalasena, Commissioner of Labour and Others (Supra)

Fernando J. (at page 148) held:

I am inclined to agree that the "prior consent" required by section 2(1)(a) need not

necessarily be contained in a single sheet of paper. If for instance an employer were to

make a written offer of a "golden handshake", stating "if you agree to the termination of

your services, please accept the enclosed cheque for X rupees as your terminal benefits

and sign and return the annexed receipt," the written offer together with the acceptance of

the cheque and the signing of the receipt would constitute a "prior consent in writing" to

termination within the meaning of section 2(1 )(a). However, it is not necessary to decide

that question because, as learned State Counsel submitted on behalf ofthe 1st Respondent,

there is a difference between consent to the termination itself (which is what section

2(1)(a) requires), and an agreement - as in this case - as to the quantum of terminal benefits

in circumstances in which the termination itself is no longer negotiable or has already been

unilaterally determined or effected (which is not enough). The Petitioner's letters and the

2nd Respondent's acceptance of the payments were all subsequent to the Petitioner's

unilateral decision to terminate the 2nd Respondent's services, and are not proof of

anything more than his agreement to the benefit's payable consequent upon that decision.

The 2nd Respondent did not give prior consent, in writing or otherwise, to the termination

of his services, but subsequently agreed to and accepted the terminal benefits offered."

In my view the Petitioner had already decided to terminate the services of the 2nd Petitioner by

the time P9 and Pl0 were written. These two documents and its attendant circumstances,

including the note thereon by the 5th Respondent that the monies were paid before him, do not

amount to "prior written approval of the Commissioner" within the meaning of section 2(1)(b) of

the Act. At the most it reflects the acceptance by those employees, the 2nd Respondent did not

sign any of these documents, of the terminal benefits.

For all of the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish any grounds on

which P17 should be quashed by a writ of certiorari.

The application is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 30,000/=.

N. Bandula Karunarathna J.

I agree.
