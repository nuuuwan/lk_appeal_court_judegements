Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner was an employee of the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) and at the time of her retirement

on 17.09.2013 she was serving as the Manager of the Bogawantalawa Branch.

The dispute between the parties arise on charge sheet dated 12.03.2014 (P6) issued to the

Petitioner by the 1st Respondent BOC. The Petitioner claims that the BOC did not have the power

to issue charge sheet P6 since the Petitioner had retired on 17.09.2013.

Page 2 of 6

Although several reliefs were prayed for in the petition, at the hearing Court was informed that

the Petitioner was limiting the relief to a writ of certiorari quashing the purported charge sheet

dated 12.03.2014 (P6) issued to the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent BOC.

In order to determine whether the issue of charge sheet dated 12.03.2014 (P6) is ultra vires the

powers of the 1st Respondent BOC, it is important to examine the disciplinary powers ofthe 1st

Respondent BOC. Although the Petitioner pleaded that the relevant Disciplinary Code is P7, it is

effective from 2nd May 1991 whereas the Respondents produced the "Disciplinary Code of Bank

of Ceylon" (lRl) which is effective from 01st November 2008 which is the applicable Disciplinary

Code.

Clause 2.1 therein specifies that the provisions ofthe Code applies to:

(a) All employees in the permanent service of the Bank (whether on probation or confirmed)

and those employed on contract basis.

(b) Employees who have reached the age of retirement and whose retirement or extension

of service have been subjected to the finalisation of the pending disciplinary

proceedings against them, even after their age of retirement. (Emphasis added)

The Petitioner falls within (b) and there are two requirements that must be satisfied for it to

apply. Firstly, the Petitioner should have reached the age of retirement which is not in issue.

Secondly, her retirement must have been subjected to the finalisation of the pending disciplinary

proceedings.

It is not in dispute that certain steps were taken by the 1st Respondent BOC by issuing letters

marked P3, P4(a) and P4(b) to the Petitioner in preparation for her retirement on 17.09.2013.

The Respondents claim that they were sent several months before the retirement of the

Petitioner as is customary before any loss or fraud was discovered.

The Respondents submitted that on the last date of work of the Petitioner, namely 16.09.2013,

the next Manager, who was then the 2nd Officer of the Bogawantalawa Branch of the 1st

Respondent BOC, one Mr. Shanmuganathan had wanted to check the vault of the pawning branch

in order to take over the functions as Manager as is the usual custom.

Then it was discovered that certain gold items were missing from the vault which were then

itemised as evidenced from document marked lR3 on which the Petitioner signed and agreed to

Page 3 of 6

pay Rs. 6,161,000/= which was the loss discovered at the time. The charge sheet P6 is based upon

these facts.

The matter for determination is whether these facts are sufficient to conclude that the Petitioner

is an employee of the BOC "whose retirement or extension of service have been subjected to the

finalisation of the pending disciplinary proceedings".

Prior to considering the relevant provisions in the Disciplinary Code of Bank of Ceylon (lR1), I

wish to examine the approach ofthe Courts to the comparable situation in so far as public officers

are concerned.

Section 12(1) of the Minutes of Pension which is applicable to public officers provides as follows:

"12(1) Where the explanation tendered by a public servant against whom, at the time of

his retirement from public service, disciplinary proceedings were pending or

contemplated in respect of his negligence, irregularity or misconduct, is considered to be

unsatisfactory by the competent authority, the Permanent Secretary. Ministry of Public

Administration, Local Government and Home Affairs may either withhold or reduce any

pension, gratuity or other allowance payable to such public servant under these Minutes."

(Emphasis added)

In Amarasekera v. Karunasena Kodituwakku, Mininster af Human Resource Develapment,

Education and Cultural Affairs and Others [(2005) 2 Sri.L.R. 58] the Petitioner had been called

upon by the letter dated 20th December 2002 to explain certain irregularities relating to certain

financial transactions involving the Secondary Education Modernization Project that took place

during the period 21st to 29th October 2002, and after the Petitioner tendered his explanations by

his letter dated 31st December 2002, a preliminary investigation had been held and the Interim

Report relating to which dated 29th January 2003 revealed that the Petitioner was, along with

certain other officers, responsible for some of the said financial irregularities. The Public Service

Commission has been informed of these findings by the letter dated 13th February 2003 albeit

two days prior to the retirement of the Petitioner, and the said Commission has determined that

the payment of pension to the Petitioner, should be withheld pending the ensuing disciplinary

proceedings as evidenced by the letter dated 23rd June 2003. This Court held that these facts

were sufficient to bring it within the words disciplinary proceedings were pending.

Page 40f6

In Peiris vs. Wijesooriya, Director, Irrigation and Others [(1999) 1 Sri.L.R. 295] stock verifications

had revealed certain shortages and the Petitioner had been interdicted in September, 1986.

There were no pending disciplinary proceedings; but the Supreme Court held that disciplinary

proceedings were "contemplated" in view of the long-drawn-out investigations which was for the

purpose of precisely ascertaining the losses and fixing responsibility for such losses.

The facts in this case are different. Here the discovery of the missing gold items from the vault on

the last working day of the Petitioner which were then itemised as evidenced from document

marked lR3 on which the Petitioner Signed and agreed to pay Rs. 6,161,000/= which was the loss

discovered at the time is in my view insufficient to bring the instant case within the words "whose

retirement or extension of service have been subjected to the finalisation of the pending

disciplinary proceedings". The 1" Respondent BOC did not take any positive action to subject the

retirement of the Petitioner to the finalisation of any pending disciplinary proceedings since no

disciplinary proceedings were pending.

However as this is a discretionary remedy the Court has the power to withhold any relief to the

Petitioner even where it is established that the impugned decision is ultra vires.

The unmeritorious conduct of the Petitioner is an issue that must be considered by this Court. In

terms of Article 140 ofthe Constitution this Court must act "according to law" in deciding whether

to issue a writ of certiorari. This means English common law principles [Sirisena Cooray v. Tissa

Dias Bandaranaike (1999) 1 Sri. L. R. 1 at 14-15)].

English Courts have considered the conduct of the Petitioner in deciding whether to grant

discretionary relief by way of judicial review. A ratepayer was denied a remedy to quash a refusal

to make a refund of rates because of his previous deliberate and unjustifiable withholding of rates

owed [Dorot Properties Ltd. v. London Borough of Brent (1990) C.O.D. 378]. A local authority

which pursued pointless litigation was denied any remedy [Windsor and Maidenhead RoyalBC v.

Brandrose Investments Ltd. (1983) 1 W.L.R. 509]. A local council which sought to challenge

ministerial confirmation of its own proposals for re-organising schools, relying on their own

procedural error was denied relief [R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Science ex. P.

Birmingham City Council (1985) 83 L.G.R. 79].

The Petitioner has not come to Court with clean hands and her conduct is unmeritorious. It is

inconceivable that the Petitioner would have agreed to pay the value of the lost gold unless she

was responsible for it.

For all the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the application without costs.
