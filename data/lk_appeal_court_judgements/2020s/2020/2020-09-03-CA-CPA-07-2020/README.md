This is a Revision Application against the order dated 02.12.2019 by the Learned High Court

Judge of Kurunegala. The Petitioner filed an application for bail in the High Court of

Kurunegala seeking to enlarge her father (the Accused Appellant 3rd Respondent) on bail.

The Learned High Court Judge by her order dated 02.12.2019 refused the application of the

Petitioner for bail. Being aggrieved by the said order the same Petitioner (the daughter of the

Accused Appellant 3rd Respondent) who filed the bail application has filed the revision

application in this Court to set aside the said order.

The Accused Appellant 3rd Respondent (hereinafter referred as the 3rd Respondent) was

indicted before the High Court of Kurunegala on five charges for having committed the

offences punishable under 344, 324, 323 and 314 of the Penal Code against two forest

officers. The )'d Respondent pleaded guilty and was convicted for all charges. Upon

conviction he was sentenced as follows to run sentences consecutively;

Charge No.OI; A term of 01 year rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 10,0001- with a

default term of 2 months imprisonment

Charge No. 02 ; A term of 01 year rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 10,0001- with a

default term of2 months imprisonment

Page 3 of 8

Charge No. 03 ; A term of 02 year rigorous impri~onment and fine of Rs. 10,000/- with a

default term of 2 months imprisonment

Charge No. 04 ; A term of 01 year rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 10,0001- with a

default term of 2 months imprisonment

Charge No. 05 ; A term of 06 months rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs. 10001- with a

default term of2 months imprisonment

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the 3'd Respondent has not filed an

affidavit to support the averments as mentioned in the decided case of CA No. 657/82

(05.09.1986). However when considering the Petition, it is apparent that the Petitioner herself

has failed to produce the originals of the documents material to the case. I st Respondent is the

Hon. Attorney General and the arguments taken up by the 1 st Respondent are all legal

arguments as mentioned in the petition. Therefore, it is not necessary to file an affidavit.

The Petitioner in the instant case is the daughter of the ]'d Respondent. When the matter was

taken up for hearing, the Learned State Counsel raised a Preliminary Objection to the effect

that the Petitioner had no locus standi to maintain the application for revision and the

Petitioner has not averred as to what relationship she has with the 3'd Respondent. Further the

Learned State Counsel submitted that based on the case of Senathilake vAG 1998 (3) SLR

290 the application for the revision has to be dismissed in limine.

In order to consider above, I would refer to a recently decided case by the Supreme Court of

Sri Lanka. In the Case of Lansage Basil Vs, Hon. Attorney General, SC Appeal 2012017

decided by the Hon. Justice Sis ira de Abrew on 03.07.2020 analyzed and interpreted the

aforementioned case as follows;

"The head note of the said judgment states as follows. "The father of the accused

has no locus standi to maintain the revision application"

In Senathilaka's case (supra) the accused who was convicted and sentenced did not

appeal against the conviction and the sentence. The father of the accused filed a

revision application against the conviction and the sentence. His Lordship Justice

Jayasuriya observed that it was a belated application. The accused in Senathilaka's

;>n~n I",,.".n~ ... ,1.", u ..... '" ,., ........ lnA J,n:l AiA HrI# I'nro 11.0 f.inl ........ A ..... tfop fl.o ; ... ",,,;,,, 11 .. ,10 .. --~-1 .... -,..-/ .r ........ "-'" 0'-'''''--.... - .... - .. -.......... J--- ..... - ..... _ .. ---- -J--- ---- "--",],---J --_ .. __

Section 241 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Learned trial Judge proceeded

Page 4 of 8

with the trial and convicted the accused.. His Lordship Jayasuriya at page 293

observed asfollows:

"The present application is an application in revision. This is an extraordinary

jurisdiction which is exercised by the Court of Appeal and the grant of relief is

entirely depend on the discretion of the Court. Here the accused's father is seeking

discretionary relief from the Court of Appeal and in considering the grant of

discretionary relief, the court will closely examine the conduct of the accused

person. Tn the exercise of a discretion the court scrupulously looks into the conduct

of the ultimate party who is deriving benefit from the orders to be made by the court

in revision. Besides this application has been preferred with undue and

unreasonable delay. The application is refused.

Therefore, it is seen that in the above case, the Court of Appeal, after considering

the conduct of the accused and belatedness of the revision application, refused to

exercise the extraordinary jurisdiction and discretion of the Court of Appeal. His

Lordship Justice Jayasuriya in the above case has not expressed a general view that

the father of an accused in each and every case has no locus standi to maintain a

revision application.

In this aforementioned case, the Supreme Court overruled the judgment by the Court of

Appeal wllich dismissed the revision application for the Petitioner Appellant (father of the

suspect) on the basis that he had no locus standi.

The Learned State Counsel in her objections submitted that the Petitioner has not averred that

she is the daughter of the )'d Respondent. However in her affidavit she has sworn and

specifically mentioned that she is the daughter of the )'d Respondent and further she has

annexed her birth certificate as proof. Also in her Petition to the High Court as the Petitioner,

she has averred her relationship as the daughter of the 3'd Respondent. Therefore the affidavit

supported with the birth certificate can be accepted by this Court. Thus in light of the above

analysis [ am of the view that the Petitioner in the instant case has locus standi to maintain

this revision application.

At this juncture I wish to draw my attention to consider whether there are exceptional circumstances. The Petitioner has submitted the following grounds as exceptional

circumstances in the Petition and the subsequent Motion;

l. The Leamed High Court Judge of Kurunegala has not considered the accused

pleading guilty in light of section J03 and 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

2. The wife of the J rd Respondent is dead and the protection of two unmarried daughters

of age 19 years and 27 years respectively are in great danger if the 3rd Respondent is

not enlarged on bai I.

J. The 3rd Respondent is a heart patient and suffering from a mental condition after the

demise of his wife.

4. In virtue of the case Kumara vs Attorney General 2003 (1) SLR 176, the 3rd

Respondent is entitled to be enlarged on Bail.

5. In virtue of Section 20 of the Bail Act, the 3rd Respondent is eligible to be enlarged on

bail.

In the case of Attorney General V. Ediriweera [S.C. Appeal No. 100/2005] (2006 B.L.R.

12), it was held that,

"The norm is that bail after conviction is not a matter of right but would be granted

only under exceptional circumstances. "

In the case of R Muthuretty V. The Queen [54 NLR 493J it was held that,

"That in bail pending appeal, Court will not grant bail as a rule, bail granted only in

exceptional circumstances ... "

In the benchmark decision of Ramu Thamotharampillai V. Attorney General (2004) 3 Sri.

L.R 180, it was held that,

"The decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and circumstances.

But in order that like cases may be decided alike and that there will be ensured some

uniformity of decisions it is necessary that some guidance should be laid down for the

exercise of that discretion. .. "

Page 6 of 8

In the case of Attorney General V. Ediriweera [S.C; Appeal No. 100/20051 (2006 B.L.R.

12) it was held that;

" The Accused-Respondent who seeks bail must not only show ill-health. but must

prove it by medical reports, which ref/ects his or her current and existing state of

health relevant to the time of the application for bail. He must additionally show that

the illness was not only a present one but that continued confinement would imperil

life or cause permanent impairment of his physical condition ... "

It has been brought to the notice of the Court that the Accused Appellant Respondent

is suffering from a medical condition pertaining to his mentality. However, the

petitioner has not submitted any documents related to the said medical condition even

though the petitioner in his petition has averred that he is suffering from an illness.

It has been brought to the notice of the Court that the 3'd Respondent is suffering from a

medical condition pertaining to his mental condition. Even though the petitioner has

submitted one document on participation of the 3,d Respondent to a clinical session of a

consultant psychiatrist, it doesn't necessarily recommend any requirement of a further

treatment or it will be a threat for him to be in remand. Therefore, in the absence of any

strong documentary evidence as to the said Mental Condition of the 3'd Respondent, such

ground is not considered as an exceptional circumstance.

[n the case of Ramu Thamotharampillai V. Attorney General (2004) 3 Sri. L.R 180, it

was held that,

" ... but the illness must be a present illness and that continued incarceration would

endanger life or cause permanent impairment of health. Moreover there must be

evidence of the nature of the illness and its effect. "

In the case of Attorney General V. Ediriweera (2006) BLR page 12 it was held that,

" ... he must additionally show that the illness was not only a present one but that

continued confinement would imperil life or cause permanent impairment of his

physical condition ... "

Page 7 of 8

Further, the 3rd Respondent is said to be a heart patient and has undergone a Coronary Artery

by-pass. The Learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala by refusing to enlarge the accused on

bail stated that the treatments from the Prison Hospital are sufficient. Even if, the 3rd

Respondent is a heart patient there is no evidence to prove that his life may be at a risk if he

is not enlarged on Bail. I am of the view that the Petitioner in the instant case has not placed

evidence that the prevailing medical conditions of the 3rd Respondent is an imperil 10 his life.

Therefore we are of the view that the petitioner has failed to establish exceptional

circumstances in order to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court. Accordingly, the

order of the Learned High Court Judge was not illegal or unlawful and therefore we see no

reason to interfere with the same. For the above reasons, we affirm the order dated

02.12.2019 and refuse to enlarge the 3rd Respondent on bail. Further, Prison authorities are

directed to duly continue the prescribed medicine and to let the 3rd Respondent to continue

with his clinical sessions as prescribed by the doctor.

This revision application is hereby dismissed subject to the above mentioned conditions.
