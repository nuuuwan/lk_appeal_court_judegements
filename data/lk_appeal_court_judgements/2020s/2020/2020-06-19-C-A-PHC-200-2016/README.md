Introduction

III This is an appeal from the Order of the learned Provincial High Court

Judge of the Sabaragamuwa Province dated 05.12.2016 refusing to issue

otice in a revision application fLIed by the Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant against die order of ejectment made by dIe leamed Magistrate of

Ratnapura lUlder section 10 of dIe State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act No.7 of 1979 as amended.

Background

121 The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as dIe

Respondent) filed an application in dIe Magistrate's Court of Ratnapura

under section 5 of dIe State Lands (Recovery of Procession) Act No. 7 of

1979 as amended, for lie ejectment of lie Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant (hereinafter referred to as lie Appellant) from dIe land

morefully described in dIe schedule to lie said application. The learned

Magiso-ate issued notice to be sen'ed on dIe Appellant by registered post

retumable on 26.02.2016 and when dIe Appellant was absent and

unrepresented on 26.02.2016, dIe leamed Magistrate issued an order of

ejeconent of dIe Appellant fi'om die relevant land.

131 Upon dIe application made on behalf of lie Respondent seeking for

dIe execution of die order of ejectment, dIe learned Magistrate directed dIe

Fiscal to eject dIe Appellant and accordingly, dIe Fiscal on 29.09.2016 had

delivered possession of dIe relevant land to dIe Respondent.

Application in Revision to the Provincial High Court of the Sabaragamuwa

Province

111 Being aggrieved by dIe said order of dIe learned Magistrate of

Ramapura, dIe Appellant preferred an application in revision to dIe High

C A. (I' IIC) 200-2016 ApI'eal- PIIC Ratllllpura ~~-2016- M.e. Ratnapura 583~9-2016

Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province to have dIe said order of ejectment

set aside or be varied. The learned High Court Judge by his order dated

05.12.2016 refused to issue notice on dIe ground dlat in view of dIe

judgment of dIe Supreme Court in Supelintendent, Staflixd Estate iUJd two

odlers v. SO/aJinuttu Rasu (2013) I Sri LR 25, dIe Provincial High Court

has no jurisdiction to entertain dIe revision application as ilie subject matter

of the application is a State land.

Appeal to ilie Court of Appeal

151 Being aggrieved by dIe said order of dIe leamed Provincial High Court

Judge, dIe Appellant has prefeITed dlis appeal to this Court in temlS of

Article 1541' (6) read widl Article 138 of dIe Constitution.

Preliminary Objections

161 When this appeal was taken up for argument on 30.01.2020, dIe

leamed President's Counsel for dIe Respondent raised dIe following two

Preliminary Objections to dIe maintainability of dlis appeal filed by the

Appellant:

I. The High Court of dIe Provinces does not have reVlSIOnaIY

jurisdiction under Article 154P(3)(b) of die Constitution in respect

of all order made by a Magistrate for ,,"jectrnent under section 10 of

dIe State Lands (RecovelY of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 as

aIllended;

2. There is no right of appeal to dIe Court of Appeal under Article

1541' (6) of dIe Constitution against the order of die Provincial High

Court refusing notice in all application in revision filed under Article

1541' (3) (b) of die Constitution.

Preliminary Objection 1

Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court under Article 154P

(3) (b) of the Constitution in respect of an order of ejectment made by a Magistrate's Court under section 10 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended.

171 The Appellant had sought to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court of the Sabaragamuwa Province in tem1S of Article

154P (3) (b) of the Constitution in respect of the order of ejectment made

by the learned Magistrate under section 10 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 as amended.

181 Mr. Maitlu'i Wickremasinghe, tile learned President's Counsel for the

Respondent submitted tllat tile word 'orders' is preceded by tl1e words

'convictions, sentences' and is followed by tl1e words 'entered or imposed'

in Article 154 (3) (b) of tl1e Constitution. He submitted that tl1e word

'orders' in Article 154 (3) (b) of the Constitution must be read in ejusdem

generis with tile words 'convictions, sentences' entered or imposed by

Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province.

191 Mr. Wickremasinghe strenuously argued tllat the word 'orders' in

Article 154P (3) (b) of tile Constitution should be limited to tile genus to

which 'convictions ,U1d sentences' ,u'e entered or imposed by Magistrates

Courts and Prin1ary Courts witllin tile Province, which entail criminal

sanctions. His contention was tllat an 'order of ejectment' made by tile

Magistrate of Ratnapura under section 10 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act is not an order of a crinlinal nature tl1at entails any penal

consequences as contemplated by Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution.

11 01 Mr. Wickremasinghe furtller argued tl1at tllOugh tl1e revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of an order of ejectment made by tl1e Magistrate

under section 10 of tl1e State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is vested

r

in tlle COUlt of Appeal under Article 138 (I) of tlle Constitution, the High

Court of tlle Provinces has no revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154P

(3) (b) of tlle Constitution in respect of an order of ejeclment made by a

Magistrate's Court under section 10 of tlle State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.7 of 1979.

1111 The detemlination of tllis question first involves a survey ,md analysis

of Article 154P (3) (b) of tlle Constitution and any otller law, if any, tllat

has conferred revisionary jurisdiction on tlle Provincial High Court in

respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrates Court ,md Primm), Courts witllin tlle Province in tlle context of

Article 138 of tlle Constitution.

(a) Jurisdiction conferred on the Provincial High Court by the 13th

Amendment to the Constitution

1121 Section 10 (2) of tlle State Lands (Recovel), of Possession) Act. No.7

of 1979 provides tllat no appeal shall lie against mly order of ejectment

made by a Magistrate under subsection (I) of tlle Act. Prior to tlle

introduction of tlle 13th Amendment to tlle Constitution, tlle COUlt of

Appeal enjoyed exclusive appellate mId revision<U')' jurisdiction under

Article 138 of tlle Constinltion, exclusive "writ jurisdiction" under Article

111 and full power to issue otller prerogative writs under Article 140 mId

tlle Constitution. These jurisdictions applied liller ak1, to tlle High Courts,

District COUlts, Magistrates Courts, Prim<U')' Courts mId Labour Tribunals.

11 31 Article 138 (I) of tlle 1978 Constitution prior to tlle inlToduction of

tlle 13tll Amendment to tlle Constilution reads as follows:

138- (1) The COUlt o/Appeal shafl ha ve and exenise subject to the provisions of the Constitution or of anI' law, an appeUilte jiJIisdiclion for dIe cOlTection of'illl envrs Ii] .1Ct or Ii] law which shall be committed by allY COUlt of First Instance, mbunill or odler

CA. (PIIC) 200-2016 Appeal-PIIC Rat"apurll ~~-2016- ~I.C. Rat"apul'a 583~9-2016

institution and sale and exclusive cog1l1zance, by W;lY of appeal, revision and restitutio ill integ17Jm, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and dlings of which such GaUlt of First Instance, tnDunal or odler institution may have taken cognizance

(emphasis added)

"

114) The 13th Amendment to the Constitution by Article Is4P established

the Provincial High Court and the sole jurisdiction conferred on the COUlt

of Appeal by Article 138 was expanded to Provincial High Courts by

Article Is4P (3) and (4) of the Constitution. Article Is4P (3) (b) of the

Constitution conferred on the Provincial High Court appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences and orders

entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the

Province. Article Is4P (3) (b) reads as follows:

"(3) Every such High COUlt shall-

(b) Notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province ".

)15) Thus, the Court of Appeal ceased to eI1joy the sole and exclusive

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions, sentences

and orders entered or imposed by the Magistrates Courts and Primary

Courts.

(b) Concurrent Appellate and Revisionary Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal and the Provincial High Court

116) However, dle powers of the Court of Appeal to take cognizance by

way of appeal, revision, restitutio in integrum of 'all causes, suits, actions,

prosecutions, matters and things of which such High Court. Court of First

Instance, tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance,' are

C A. (I'HC) 200-2016 Appeal- I'He Ratnapurll 44-2016- M.e. Ratnapura 58349-2016

,

vested exclusively in the Court of Appeal (see- the Amended Article 138).

The appellate and revisioniu)' jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court

conferred by Article 1541' (3) (b) of dIe Constitution has dms been limited

to convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by ilie Magistrates

Courts and Primill1' Courts wid lin the Province. The appellate and

revisionat)' jmisdiction con!eITed on die Provincial High Court is, dlUs,

exercised by dIe Provincial High Court, 'notwithstanding anything in

Article 138 and subject to any law'.

1171 Article 1541' (3) (c) of dIe Constitution enacts dIal evel), such High

COUlt shall "exercise such odieI' jurisdiction and powers as Parliat11ent

may, by law, provide". This paved dIe way for Pat-lianlent to confer further

jurisdiction (odler dlat1 diose set out in Article 154P (3) (a) at1d (b) atld

154P (4) (a) atld (b) on die Provincial High Court by odIeI' laws. The High

Court of dIe Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 was

enacted by Parlianlent and section 3 of die said Act, suqject to atly law,

conferred appellate atld revisionaty' jurisdiction on dIe Provincial High

COUlt in respect of orders made by Ll.bour Tribunals atld widlin die

Province atld orders made under section 5 or section 9 of dIe Agrariatl

Services Act, No. 58 of 1979, in respect of any latld situated widlin die

Province.

1181 It is seen, however, dlat dIe scheme ofilie Alticle 138 atld IMP of dIe

Constitution atld dIe High Coml of Ille Provinces (Special Provisions) Acl

:\I 0_ 19 of 1990 cleat-Iy indicates dlat Article 154P of ilie Constitution did

not take away dIe powers of dIe Court of Appeal under Article 138 of dIe

Constitution. Thus, in dIe case of SwasliJJKa TexlIle Industries Ltd v.

ThanlIige DayaralIJe (1993) 2 Sri LR 348, Fernando J. observed at page

352:

That .Jimsdicaon was also 'subject to dIe Jaw' alJd therefOJ-e (as the case of Article 138) was not entrenched, ,wd was liable to alteraaon by Parliament by OJdliJalY Jaw. "

1191 It is crystal clear that Article 154P (3) (b) conferred appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction on the Provincial High Court "notwithstanding

anything in Article J 38 and subject to any law" in respect of convictions,

sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and

Primary Courts within the Province. Although the Court of Appeal thus,

ceased to enjoy sole and exclusive jurisdiction under Article 138 in respect

of convictions, sentences and orders made by Magistrates Courts and

Primary Courts, Article 154P (3) (b) did not take away the powers

exercised by the Court of Appeal under Article J 38 of the Constitution

(Shanf alld odJen v. WickremasUliya alld odlen (20 J 0) J Sli LR 255, at p.

262). Thus, the Court of Appeal and t11e High COUlt of t11e Provinces

enjoy concurrent appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of t11e

1221 The existence of conCUlTent jurisdiction of dIe Court of Appeal ,Uld

!lIe Provincial High Court is fLllthcr confirmed by section 12 of dIe High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act 1\0. 19 of 1990. Section 12

has empowered the C0U11 or Appeal, in dIe event. of identical appeal or

P;u;ulleSw,l1.1' (2002) 2 Sri LR 3tl.()).

1231 It is crystal clear from these observations that Article 154P(3)(b) of dle

Constitution conferred concurrent appellate and revisionary jurisdiction on

dle Provincial High COUlt in respect of convictions, sentences and orders

entered or imposed by the Magistrates Courts ,Uld Primary Courts within

dle Province. In dle result, any person aggrieved by a conviction, sentence

or order entered or imposed by Magistrates COUlts and Primary Courts

has an option to file an application in revision, either in the Court of

Appeal in dle exercise of dle revisionary powers under Article 138 of dle

Constitution or in the High Court of the Province under Article

(b) of the Constitution in respect of the order of ejectment made by the

Magistrate's Court of Ratnapura under section 10 of the State Lll1ds

(Recovery of Possession) Act. It is therefore beyond ilI'gument that

notwithst;ulding ilIlything in Article 138 of the Constitution, Article 15tjP

(3) (b) of the Constitution has conferred concurrent revisionary juriscliction

on the High COUlt in respect of the order of ejectment made by dle

Magistrate of Rat:napura uncler section 10 of dle State L;ulds (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.7 of 1979 as amended.

(c) Does the scope of the word 'orders' in Article 154P (3) (b) limit to the

orders of a criminal nature?

1251 In dlis context, I shall now proceed to consider dle argument

aclvilllCecl by Mr. Wickremasinghe dlat dle jurisdiction of dle Provincial

High Court conferred by Article 154P (3) (b) is limited to orders of a

crinlinal nature by dIe application of the ejusdem genen:, rule ilIld

dlerefore, dle "order of ejectment" made by dIe Magistrate uncler section

10 of dle State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act is not ilIl order of a

criminal nature contemplated by Article 154P (3) (b) of dle Constitution.

Applicability of EJusdem genens Rule

1261 The ejusdem genens or "of the same genus" is a rule that operates to

restrict the meaning of general words by reference to specific words in their

immediate vicinity (Langan Maxwell Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Ed. P.

297 and Bennion Statutory Interpretation, 4th Ed. p. 828). In Halsbury's

Laws of Engl;U1d, the said rule has been defined thus:

'11.05 a nile, where in a statute, dlere are general words following pi/iticu/ar and speciHc words, tlIe general words must be confined to

duilgs of dIe same Iuild as dIOse speciHed, aldlOugh dJls, as a rule 0/ constl7Jction, must be applied WId! caution, and subject to tlIe pnin-7iY I7Jle dlat statutes are to be constl7Jed lil accordance wldl dIe intention o/PaIliament. For dJe l,Jusdem Cenens l7J/e to apply, die

C A. (PHC) 200-2016 Appeal- PIIC Ratll"pur" ~~-2016- M.e. Ratn"pu,." 583~9-2016

specific wOlds must constitute a category, class or genus, then only dlings which belong to dlat categOIy, class or genus fall within dIe general wOlds. '

1271 Where the terms listed are similar enough to constitute a class or

genus, the courts will presume, in interpreting the general words that

follow, that they are intended to apply only to things of dIe same genus as

the particular items listed. (Legislative Drafting-Shaping the Law for dIe

new Millermium, pp 254~255).

1281 The rule recognises and gives effect to bodl the specific and general

words by using dIe class indicated by the specific words to extend dIe scope

of dIe statute widl dIe general words include additional terms of object

widlin the class (Archbishop of Canterbwy 's case: 1596 Singer 47:17 of

272-73). Thus, it is a well-established rule in dIe construction of statutes,

dlat general terms following ones apply only to such persons or things as

are r;jusdem generis with those contemplated in dIe language of dIe

Legislature (R v. Clewordl (1864) 4 B. & S. 927). Thus, unless dlere is a

genus or category, there is no room for dIe application of the ejusdem

geneIis doctrine (su pra).

1291 In Amar Chandra Chakraborty v. The Controller of Excise, Covt of

71ipura, AgaJ'tIla and others, AIR 1972SC 1863, Justice Dua, observed on

dIe principle of ejusdem genens as follows:

"The ejusdem genens rule strives to reconcile dIe incompatibility between speci5c and general words. TillS doclJiIJe applies when (I) dIe statute contains an enumeralJon of specific words; (ii) dIe subjects of dIe enwlleralJon conSlJtute a class or categOIY; (iIj) dlat class or c,1tegDIY is not exhausted by dIe enllI1leralJon; (I'v) dIe general te17n follows dIe eIlumeralJoIl; and (v) dlere IS no iIJdicalJon

of a difTerenf lef,'1slalJ've ljltent.

C A. (I'HC) 200-2016 Appea'- PIIC Ralllllpura ~~-20'6- M.e. Ratnapura 583~9-2016

1301 According to Sutherl,md in his Statutory Construction' (3rd Edition,

Vol. II, p. 395) the ejusdem genens has no application in the following

cases:

a. where the general term is followed by ,modler general term;

b. where particular and specific terms exhaust the whole genus, then die general words ,ue constlUed as embracing a larger genus;

c. where specifically enumerated objects are essentially diverse in character;

d. where the ordinary legislative intent is plain, such intent being gathered from a recognised source of assistance, aids to construction.

/31/1n Tillmal1lJs& Co. v. SS KI1l1tsford, LJinited(l908) 2 KB 385 (CA),

FalWell L,J. observed at at 403 that there is no room for die application of

the ejusdem genens doctrine where the words are clearly wide in dleir

me,ming and they ought not to be qualified on die ground of their

association with odler words. Thus, unless dlere is a genus or class or

categOIY, dlere is no room for die application of the ejilsdem gellens

doctrine.

1321 it is imperative to note dlat die COUlt's primary goal in interpreting

statutes is to !,rive effect to die legislative intent and the best evidence of dlat

intent is the statute's plain language. 'The dominant purpose in constlUing

a statute is to ascertain the intention of die legislature as expressed in die

statute, considering it as a whole and in its context dlat intention, ,mel

dlerefore, die meaning of die statute, is primarily to be sought in the words

used in die stc1.tute itself, which must, if dley <ue plain <Uld wlanlbiguous be

applied as dley stc1.l1d' (Daypack Systems Pvt. Ltd. Etc v. Union Of India &

1331 It would be important to refer to the following passage of Sripavan].

(as he then was) in Herath v. Morgan EnlfliJeermg (Pvt) Limited SC Appeal

No. 214/2012-SC Minutes 0[27.06.2013:

"/ldJe laJJl,JUage ofdJe enactment is cleaJ' aJJd unambiguous, it would not be lelfliimate for dJe COUIts to add wOlds by Jmp/icationliJto dJe

laJJgJ1age. It is ,1 selded law ofliJtelpretation dJ,1l dJe words aJ'e to be Interpl'eted as dley appear In dle provision, slinple aJJd lfldJJ1matic<y meaJJing is 10 be Ifl'ven to dIem, aJJd nodJing can be added or subtJacted The Courts must construe dJe wOld as dJey find it aJJd cannot go outsIde dJe ilJJ1bit of dJe section aJJd speculate as to what dJe lelflslatUI'e liJtended An JiJlelpretalion o/'section 9 which defeats dIe intent iUJd plllpose for which it was enacted should be aVOIded"

1311 Thus, the Courts look at a statute and detelmines what it means. The

most important thing to be determined is the intent of Parlianlent. The

language of the statute cannot, however, be distorted under the guise of

construction, or so limited by construction as to defeat the manifest intent

of Parliament (United States v. RaynOl; 302 U.S. 540 (58 S.Ct. 353, 82 L.

Ed. 1j,13). Thus, in the construction of statutes, addition or substitution of

words or which results in rejection of words have to be avoided. The Privy

Council held in Crawford II; Spooner 11846) 6 Moore PC II dlat

771e construction ofdJe Act must be taken kom dJe baJ'e words of dJe Act. We CaJlJ10t fish out what possibly may have been dIe mtention of dJe Lelflslature We CaJJ/lot aJd dJe Lelflslatul'e's defective phI'ilSJiJg of aJJ Act.

has given dlem and to taKe dIe meaJJJilg which tile words given llaturally imply .... "

1351 It is a well settled principle in law tllat tlle COUIt GUillot attempt to

substitute anything into a statutory provision which is plain and

unambiguous as tlle language employed in a statute is tlle delemlinative

factor of legislative intent. Thus, the question of construction arises only in

the event of an ambiguity or tlle plain meaning of tlle words used in tlle

Statute would be self-defeating (l S. Nayak. v. A. R. AntulayAIR I!J8j SC

(iH/I). Again, in CIT v. SundaradeVl; (1957) 32 ITR 615) (SC), it was held

by die Indian Supreme Court tllat (i) unless tllere is an anlbiguity, it would

not be open to tlle Court to depart from tlle normal rule of construction

which is tlle intention of tlle legislature; (ii) It should be primarily to gatller

from tlle words which are used; and (iii) it is only when tlle words used are

ambiguous that tlley would stUld to be ex;unined and considered on

surrounding circumstances and constitutionally proposed practices.

1361 In Crasim Industries Ltd v. Contmller oFCustoms, Bombay, Appeal

(Civil) 1951 of 1998 SC, 4 April, 2002, dIe Comt has explicitly observed

that:

"Where dIe words rue dear illld dlele is no ObSCllllty, illld dlele is no ambiguity and dIe intention oFdle legislature is dearly conveyed,

dlere i5 no scope for dIe COllll to take upon itselF dIe task of '?men(hilg or aitemal1ilg dIe statuto/y pmVlsions ....... "

1371 It is clear from tllese observations that if tlle words of a statute are

clear and unanlbiguous and the ordinaty legislative intent can be gathered

Irom the plain meaning or the language used in tlle statutOlY text, no need

of interpretation would arise by the application of the rule ejusdem genens.

1381 At tllis stage, it becomes necessaty for tllis Court to identify the range

of ordinary ;Uld accept.ed meanings of the words in Article 15,j,J) (g) (b) of

C A. (I'IIC') 2002016 4ppeal. PIIC RalnaplI ra ~42016 M.e. Ratnllpu .... 583~92016

tJle Constitution tJlat can convey the mc,Uling of tJle " lid words. AI1icIe

151P (:~) (b) demonstrates tJlat notwitJlstanding <lnytJling in Article 138 and

suqject to any law, the le!,rislature inlended to conler tJle appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction on the Provincial High Court III respect of

convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by M<L!,ristrales

COllIts and Primary Courts within tJle Province.

1391 The plain and ordinarv meaning of the word "conviction" is a finding

of a person !,'llilty of ,lI1 offence by a ./udge or ./ury in a Court of LlW alter

trial. A plain ,Uld ordin,u")' me,Uling of die word "sentence" is tJle

punislll1lent assigned to an accused/defendant found guilty by a Co lilt, or

./ urv and lixed by law hlr a palticular ofJence. On thc other h,Uld, the plain

;Uld ordinal" meaning of the word "order" is a direction issued by a Court

or a ./udge requiring a person to do or not do sometJling- it may be a final

order (one that concludes the court action) or an interim order (one during

the action).

1401 Ordinarily, dle words "convictions and sentences" are read together

alld used in proceedings of a criminal nature in respect of or in cOIU1ection

with any offence which entail penal sanctions. The word "orders" 1I1

Article IMP (3) (b) however, in my view cannot be linlited to dle genus to

which the words "convictions" and "sentences" are intended in

proceedings of a criminal nature. The word "order" may include a

direction entered by a judge requiring a person to do or not to do

something in bOtJl proceedings of criminal or civil nature.

1411 Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution has not limited the scope of

dle revisionary jurisdiction of dle Provincial High Court to "convictions,

sentences and orders" of a criminal nature widl penal sanctions made by a

Ma!,ristrate or a Prinlary Court Judge in respect of or in cOIU1ection widl

any offence. The revisionary jurisdiction of dle Provincial High Court may

C A. (I'Be) 200-2016 Appcal- PHC Ratnupura -1-1-2016- M.e. Ratnupum 583-19-2016

extend to "any order" entered by MagistTates COlllts or Primary Courts

widun dIe Province, regardless of d1e nature of die proceedings, provided

however, that such COUlts have jurisdiction to make such orders in terms

of dIe law.

1421 I am of the view d1at mis Court cannot overstep d1e constitutional

mandate conferred on the Provincial High Court by Article 154P (3) (b) of

dIe Constitution by unnecessarily and unduly limiting and distorting d1e

clear and unambiguous language of Article 154P (3) (b) of d1e Constitution.

The Legislature has chosen carefiilly and advisedly the terms "convictions',

"sentences" ;Uld "orders" in their plain, ordinarv ,Uld reco!;nised meal1in!;s

in court proceedings. The meaning of d1e words used in Article 154P (3)

(b) is perfecdy clear and mere is no inconsistency, ambiguity, absurdity or

il1justice in me plain ,md clear language of Article 154P (3) (b) d1at justifies

any till'mer modification of d1e language.

1/1.:11 If the Legislature's intent in Anidc l.'i4P (in (b) is limited to orders or

a criminal nature, it would clc;lriy (;lil to !,,jve effect to die le!,,jslaturc's

choice in Artkle 151.1' (:-l) (b) of die COlIStitlltion. Article 154P (3) (b)

Gumot, by ,UlY process of interpretation, be treated as limiting d1e word

"orders" to genus to which "convictions" and "sentences" are intended in

proceedings of a criminal nature. The Illie of ejusdem genens has,

dlerefore, no application.

1441 I am of d1e view dlat die appellate or revisionary jurisdiction of me

Provincial High Court conferred by Article 1541' (3)(b) cannot, by any

process of interpretation, be limited to orders of a criminal nature dlat

entail penal sanctions. I hold mat Article 1541' (3) (b) of d1e Constitution

has contelTed revisionary jurisdiction on me Provincial High Court in

respect of dIe order of ejectment made by a Magistrate' s Court under

1461 In view of dlis submission, it is inlportant to consider whemer me

Supreme Court has imposed any restriction to dIe scope of dIe revisionary

jurisdiction of dIe Provincial High Court in respect of an order made by a

Magistrate's COUlt widlin dIe Province under section 10 of dIe State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act

1471 In SuperiI1tendent, Stafford Estate and two odlers v. SO/aJinudlU Rasu

(supra), me Competent AudlOrity initiated proceedings in dIe Magisu<tte's

Court of uwara Eliya under section 5 of dIe State Lands (Recovery of

Petitioner from dIe State land described in me schedule to dIe application.

The Respondent-Petitioner filed an application in me Provincial High

COlllt of Kandy praying for a writ of certiorari to quash me quit notice fLIed

in dIe case. The Applicant-Respondent raised a preliminary objection mat

as dIe subject matter of dIe action peltains to a State Land which does not

fall widun me Provincial Council List, dIe Provincial High COUIt had no

jurisdiction to hear and deternline me matter.

1481 The Provincial High COUlt upheld dIe objection and dismissed me

application. On appeal, dIe Court of Appeal, however, held dlat dIe "State

Land" becomes a sUQject of dIe Provincial Council List and merefore, dIe

C A. (I'IIC) 200-2016 ~p"e"l. Pile Ratllapura 442016 M.e. Ratllapurn 583492016

Provincial High COUlt has jurisdiction to hear and detemline the writ

application.

1491 A pemsal of dIe Supreme Court judgment reveals dlat dIe questions of

law upon which ilie special leave to appeal granted were as follows:

1- Did dIe Court of Appeal err by deciding dlat dIe Provincial High

Court has jurisdiction to hear cases where dispossession or

encroachment or alienation of State lands is/are in issue?

2- Did dIe COUlt of Appeal err by failing to consider whedler dlere is a

right of appeal against dIe order of dIe High Court dismissing dIe

application in/imine for want of jurisdiction?

1501 Having considered ilie Constitutional Provisions and the judicial

precedents to determine whedler dIe Provincial High Court could exercise

writ jurisdiction in terms of Article 154P (4) (b) of ilie Constitution in

respect of a quit notice issued under dIe Provisions of dIe State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979, dIe Supreme Court held dlat

ilie Provincial High Court has no writjUlisdiction in respect of quit notices

issued under the State Lmds (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979.

1511 Article 154 (4) (b) of the Constitution confers on dIe Provincial High

Courts to issue, "according to law-

(a) orders in dIe nature of habeas COlPUS, in respect of persons illegally

detained within dIe Province; and

(b) orders in ilie nature of writ~ of certioran; prohibition, procedendo,

mandamus and quo wal1<JJ1to against any person exercising wiiliin

dIe Province, any power under-

(i) Any law; or

C A. (I'HC) 200-2016 Appeal- PIIC Ratllnpura -14-2016- ~1.c. Ralnapu!':, 583-19-2016

(ii) Any statute made by the Provincial Council established for

that Province;

in respect of any matter set out in dIe Provincial Council List."

1521 The main issue dlat arose for the determination by dIe Supreme

COUlt was whedler the Provincial High Court could exercise writ

jurisdiction under Article 154P (4) of dIe Constitution to quash a quit

notice issued under the Provisions of dIe State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.7 of 1979. Their Lordships of dIe Supreme Court

determined dIe two questions formulated in dIe a1fIrmative and His

Lordship the ChiefJustice, Mohan Pieris, at page 22 observed:

"When one lTalJ5poses this lilterpretation of dIe phrase 'allY matter set out In dIe PlVvincial Council List' dlat is determinative on dIe ingredient neceSSalY to issue ,1 wnt in the PlVvincial High Court m relation to State Land, dIe VItal precondition which is found in Article

154P (4) (b) of the Constitution is sadly lacluilg m dIe instant C;L5e. In tenns of dlat Article, a PlVVIllcial Council is empowered to issue prelvgative remedies, accordIng to law, only on dIe foUowing gmunds-

(a) There must be a person Wldlin die plVVlilce who must have

exercised power under

(b) Any law or

(c) Any statute made by dIe PlVVIilcial Council

(d) In respect of ally matter set out IiI dIe ProVIilcial CouncIl List"

1531 The Supreme COUlt clearly detemuned dlat dIe Provincial High

Court has no jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari under Article 154 (4)

(b) of the Constitution in respect of a quit notice issued under the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. His Lordship the Chief Justice

Mohan Pieris, at pages 22-23 observed:

"No doubt, dIe competent audlolity IiI tile lilstant exercised his power of'issuing a qUIt notice under a law, nalne/y State Lands

1541 On the other hand, there is no reference whatsoever, in the Supreme

Court judgment to Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution, which confers

revisionaIY jurisdiction on the Provincial High Court in respect of aIly

order made by Magistrates Court or PrimaIY COUIts widlin dle Province.

Having eXaInined Constitutional provisions, including Article 154P (4) (b),

Provincial Council List (List I), Reserved List (List II), Appendix II aJ1d dIe

judicial precedents, the Supreme Court held at page 23 that:

"In die uirumst;U]ces, die COlllt of Appeal en-ed lil law lil hokhilg that dle PIVVlilClai High Court ofKandy had jurisdiction to i'.me a

1561 In the present case, the Appellant invoked the revisionary jurisdiction

of the Provincial High COUlt in terms of Article 154P (3) (b) of the

Constitution and not under Article 154P (4) of the Constitution and

therefore, tlle decision in Supeniltendent, Stafford Estate and two odlers v.

So/aiIlludw Rasu has no application to tlle present case.

1571 During the hearing, our attention was drawn to the recent decision of

Insdtute v. K.N. Deen C. A (PH C) No. 149/2014 decided on 17.06.2015.

In tlle said case, the Court of Appeal held that (i) Article 154P (3) (b) of

the Constitution has not excluded the power of tlle Provincial High Court

to exercise revisionary jurisdiction regarding State Lands under tlle

Provisions of tlle State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979;

and (ii) tlle Supreme Court has only decided in Supermtendent StaffOJd

had no jurisdiction to issue writs under Article 154P(4) of tlle Constitution

in relation to any matter conceming State Lands. The Leave to Appeal

against the said judgment was refused by the Supreme Court in S.c. SPL.

jurisdiction in respect of an order of t:iectment made by a Magistrate's

o. 7 of 1979 as an1ended. In d1e circumstances, I hold d1at the Provincial

Magistrate's Comt of RaUlapura under section 10 of d1e State Lands

in ilie exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (b) or 3 (c) or (4),

(c) Appeals to the Court of Appeal from High Court under the High Court

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990.

1771 It is sil,'llificant to note dlat the marginal note to section 11 of the High

COUlt of dIe (Special Provisions) Act reads "Appeal to Court of Appeal"

,Uld dIUS, section II has granted jurisdiction to dIe Court of Appeal (forum

jurisdiction) to hear certa.in appeals from dIe High Court. Section II of dIe

High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act reads as rollows:

I. The Cowl of Appeal shall have and exercise, subject to dJe provisions of dli5 Act or any odler law, an appellate jwisdicdon lor

die cOlTection of all envrs in !act or lil law whidl shall be con1Jmtted by any High Cowt estabJJ:\'hed by A11ide l54P of die Constitution in dIe exercise of its jillisdiction under paragraph (.'1) (a), or (4) of A1tide 154P of dIe Constitution and sole and exdusive cognizance by way of appeal, revision iUld restitutio lil integ171m of all causes~ suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and dlJilg3' of whidl sudl High

1781 Thus, under section 11 (1) of the Act No. 19 of 1990, the Court of

Appeal shall have and exercise, subject to the provisions of the High Court

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act o. 19 of 1990 or any other law:

1. An appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors conmutted

by the High Court established by Article 154P in the exercise of its

jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (a) or Article 154P (4) of the

Constitution; and

2. Sole and exclusive cogruzance by way of appeal, reVlSlon and

restitution interim of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters

and things of which such High Court may have taken cognizance;

1791 The first part of section II enables the Court of Appeal to receive and

exercise, subject to the provisions of the Act or any other law, an appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of errors in fact or in law which shall be

comnutted by any High Court established by Article 154P of the

Constitution in the exercise of its jurisdiction under paragraph (3)(a) or (4)

of Article I54P. This section has created and granted jurisdiction to the

COUlt of Appeal to hear appeals from the High Court established by

Article 154P in the exercise of its jurisdiction under paragraphs (3)(a) and

or (4) of Article 154P of the Constitution.

1801 The first part of section II (I) however, does not expressly or by

implication /:,'rant a right of appeal to ,U1V indi~idual agl,,'lieved by any error

committed b~' the High COUl1 established by fu1icle l54P of tlle

ConstiLution in the exercise of it, jurisdiction under paral,'1-aph (3) (b) of

Article 154P of the Constitution. It has only gr,U1ted appellate jurisdiction

to Ule Court of Appeal in respect of errors committed by the High Court

C A. (PHC) 200-2016 Appeal- PHC Ratnllpurll 442016- M.e. Rat.lIpur" 58349-2016

in the exercise of its jurisdiction under paragnph (.'\) (a) or (;t.) or Article

I fj,j.p of the Constitution.

1811 The second part of section II (1) also gives the Court of Appeal "sole

and exclusive cognizance by way of appeal, revision and restitutio ill

illtegmm of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things of

which such High Court may have taken cognizance". However, the second

PaIt is complementary to the first part and proceeds to !,rive the Court of

Appeal sole aIld exclusive cognizaIlce over all the matters referred to in

section II (1). It further spells out the maImer of the exercise of the

appellate jurisdiction of Ule Court of Appeal (by way of appeals or

revisions or restitution integmm) in respect of all UlOse matters referred to

in section II (I) (see Ule intel1)retation of Ule second part of Article 138 by

KulatungaJ in Abeygullilsekera v. Sewllga iIlld others (1997) I Sri LR 62).

1821 However, the first part of section II (1) is limited to paragraph (3) (a)

or (4) of Article 154P aIld paI"agraph (3) (b) of AIticle 154P is excluded

from Ule exercise of Ule jurisdiction of Ule Court of Appeal under section

II (1) of Ule Act

(d) Powers of Court of Appeal under Section 11 (2) of the Act No. 19 of

1990

1831 Subsection (2) ,md (3) of section 11 of Ule Act No. 19 of 1990 only

refers to Ule powers of the Court of Appeal in Ule exercise of its

jurisdiction (wheUler by way of appeals or revisions or restitutio In

1841 In temlS of subsection (2) of section I I, the Court of Appeal has

power, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under section I 1 (I) to affiml,

reverse, COITect or modify any order, judgment, decree or sentence

according to law and give directions referred to in subsection (2) to the

High Court established by Article 154P or exercise any other power

relened to in subsection 3.

1851 In my view, the words in section I I (2) cannot be read in isolation and

therefore, it should be read widl die words in section I I (I) of die Act The

powers of die COUlt of Appeal under section I I (2) are limited to the

matters referred to in section II (I) in the exercise of its jurisdiction-

whedler appellate or revisionaIY, under paragraph (3) (a) or (4) of Article

154P of die Constitution. Section II CaI1I10t be dissected into two parts aIld

held dlat in addition to subsection (I) of section II, subsection (2) of

section II has fumier created a separate jurisdiction to the Court of Appeal

for the correction of 'any order' made by the High Court in dIe exercise of

its appellate or revisionaIl' jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (b).

1861 Section II of the Act No. 19 of 1990 in aIly event, h,L<; not expressly or

hy implication gr;U1ted a right of appeal to die COUlt of Appeal in respect

of aIly order made by the High Court in the exercise of its revisionaIy or

appellate jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (b) of dIe Constitution.

1871 In the result, die powers of the Court of Appeal to affirm, reverse or

modify any order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High Court under

section II (2) of the High Court of the Provisions (Special Provisions) Act

should be read in die context of any order, judgment, decree or sentence

entered or imposed by the High Court in die exercise of its jurisdiction

under paragraph (3) (a) or (4) of Article 154P of the Constitution.

jurisdiction under parap;raph un (b) of Article 15,j.p of the Constitution is

p;overned by Article 154P (G) of the Constitution. I hold that it is Article

of Appeal and UIllS. any person ap;p;Tieved by any final order or judgment or

sentence of any Hip;h Court, made in the exercise of its jurisdiction under

such fmal order or judgment or sentence.

(e) Is the order refusing notice a "final order or judgment" within the

meaning of Article 154P (6) of the Constitution?

1891 Mr. vVickremasinghe submitted that Article l.'i/W ((j) has limited the

rip;ht of appeal to a fmal order, judgment or sentence of a High Court of a

Province exercising its jurisdiction under paragraph (il) (b) or (:-3) (c) or (II.)

of Article 1 S1P. His contention was that the order refusing notice by the

High Court is not a final order, judgment or sentence within the me;U1ing

of Article 15,1,P (G) of the Constitution ;Uld as such, no appeal could have

becn liled by tllc Appellant ap;ainst such order under Article 1541' (G) of

order of the High Court of the Province did not result in die determination

or die rights of die parties ,Uld dIUS, il is not a linaJ order under Article

1921 Our attention has been drawn by Mr. Wickremasinghe to the recent

question dlat arose in dIe said case was whedler dIe order of the High

Court refusing notice in a revision application ftled in respect of an order

made by a Primary Court Judge under Part VII of dIe Primary Courts

Procedure Act was a "final order" under Article 154P(6) of dIe

Constitution and if so, whedler an appeal lies against such an order.

SellilJlaJ-a.ke v. H. C. C'haJlllka Iaxantkl and olhen (supra) had been

submitled that Chapter LVIII of the Civil Procedure Code refers to

appeals against orders and judgments of the original Courts whereas the

present appeal has been filed against an order of the Provincial High Court

in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. His contention was that Article

15,1.1' ((i) does not speak about a linality of an order or a judgment like

Chapter LVIII of the Civil Procedure Code and, thus, an appeal lies to the

Cmllt of Appeal against the impuglled order under Article 1541' (6) of tJle

Constitutioll.

not apply to die present appeal tiled umler Article 151\.1' (6) of the

Constitution.

1951 The learned Counsel tor die Appellant did not, however, seek to base

his argument dlat die impugned order was a ~iudgment" widlin fie meaning

of Article 1541' (6) of dle Constitution. The fu"st question dlat calls for a

decision under dlis PaIt is as to what constitutes a "tinaJ order" tor die

purpose of Article 1541' (6) of die Constitution aIld fien, whedler die

order of fie Provincial High Court refusing notice amounts a "tinaJ order"

wifiin dle me;uung of Article 1541' (6) of die Constitution of Sri Lanka.

1961 The expression "finaJ order" is obviously used in Alticle 151\,1' (6) as

opposed to die expression "interlocutory order". The expressIOn

C A. (I'IIC) 200-2016 Appeal- PIIC Ratoillpura ~4-2016- M,e. Ih'napu"" 583~9-2016

"interlocutory order" is used only in the proviso to section 9 of the High

Court of the Provinces (Special provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 in relation

to a special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The crucial question

that arises is: what is the test for detennining whether an order is a "final

order" widlin dIe meaning of Article 154P (6) of the Constitution.

1971 I shall first consider dIe argument of Mr. Wanigapura. Section 751

(5) of the Civil Procedw'e Code provides "Notwidlstanding anything to the

contHI)' in this Ordinance, for dIe purposes of this chapter-

"judgment" means any judgment or order having the effect of a fmal

judgment made by any civil court; and

"order" means the final expression of any decision m any civil

action, proceeding or matter which is not a "judgment".

1981 A perusal of the above-mentioned judgments pronounced by dIe

Supreme Court reveals dIat the English cases have not detennined what

constitutes a "judgment" or an "interlocutory order" under dIe Civil

Procedure Code of Sri Lanka. However, it is absolutely clear dIat our

Supreme Court has consistendy followed English cases and judgments of

dIe Privy Council as a guiding light in detemlining what constitutes a

"judgment" and an "interlocutory order" WIder section 754 (5) of dIe Civil

Procedure Code.

1991 In SiJiwarrfana I, Air Ceylon Uri (supra), dIe Supreme Court, ill

particular, had referred to the well-known English decisions in Saj,wJa17 v.

Sljiwarr/,wa I: I'ur Ce.vloJ] Llr/ (supra) laid down dIe following guidelines

which would help in detemtining whedler a particular order has dIe effect

of a final judgment under section 754 (5) of dIe Civil Procedure Code by

(3) The finality of die order must be detemlined in relation to me

(4) The mere fact dlat a caI'dinai point in dIe suit has been decided

or even a vital and irnPOrtaJlt issue determined in dIe case, is not

enough to make all order, a tinal one.

11011 In S. R;!lendra Che{/l~7J' ;wd OdJelS v. S. N,7Ja),;w;m { 'helllfir alld

which the Court eventually makes. Thus, dle Court held dlat an application

for a new trial if granted would clearly be interlocutory and where it is

refused, it is still interlocutory.

11021 In Dona Padl7la Pn)'anlhi F. H(,'. (f/iulIika.layitlJ/k1 ;Uld two others

(supra), the two issues that were considered by a bench comprising seven

.Judges of dle Supreme Cotll1 were (i) wheOler dle judgment in R,yendr;UI

Chel1iar iliat the 'application approach' test should be preferred over Ole

order approach test in deciding whether an order is a final or interiocutOlY

order in ci\'il proceedings should be revisited in olis appeal.

11O:~1 In Ole said case, a preliminary issue was raised by dIe Defend;mts

dlat dlc Plaintitl' had tailcd to comply wid I section 1j,0 (d) of the Civil

11 0/\.1 His Lordship the Chief Justice Dep thus, held that (i) if the

preliminary ol~jectjons were rejected, the cases would have proceeded to

trial and as such, in both cases, at the time of dismissal, the rights of tlle

parties were not determined; (ii) orders given in both cases ;u'e

interlocutory orders and the proper course of action is to lile leave to

appeal application under section 75-1. (2) and not preferring an appeal

under section 751\ (I) of the Civil Procedure Code.

11051 Though the English Courts had not expressed their views in the

context of the Civil Procedure Code of Sri Lanka, they had interpreted the

expressions, "judgment" or "finaf order" filr the pllllJose appeals to the

Court or Appeal exercising appellate jurisdiction. The Supreme Court or

Sri Lanka has repeatedly adopted English cases, while interpreting tlle

expressions "judgment" or "interlocutory order" for me purpose of appeals

to the Court of Appeal or tlle Civil Appeal High COUIt.

11061 In tlle circumstances, it would be apt to examine tlle rationale of tlle

application approach adopted by me Privy Council in Salaman v. Wal1Jer

(supra), Bozson v. Ai!Jindlal1J Dis!Jict COIlJ1oi (supra) and Salter Rex v.

Cosh (supra) to determine what constitutes a "final order" under Article

154P (6) of tlle Constitution.

(f) A "final order" defined in three English Cases

11071 The tel111 "final" is obviously used in Article 154P (6) as opposed to

tlle teml "interlocutory' and tl1US, tlle term "interlocutory order" is to be

C. A. (I'HC) 200-2016 Appeal- PIIC Ratllapura 44-2016- M.e. Ratnllpun. 58349-2016

understood and taken to mean converse of the teml "final order". The

views expressed in die following English law cases have been considered by

our Supreme Court as !,'1.liding lights to determine what constitutes a "fmal

order" or an "interlocutory order".

Salaman test-Application approach-when whichever way it went, it would

finally determine the rights of the parties

11081 In SalamaJl v. WaJneI; (supra), the question on appeal was whether

the order dismissing the plaintiffs action on the basis that the statement of

claim filed by dIe plaintiff did not disclose any cause of action was a fmal

order or an interlocutory one. Lord Esher, M. R. laid down dIe test for

determining dIe question as follows:

~nle question must depend on what would be tile result of tile decision ofdle Divisional Court, assUIwilg it to be given ill favour of eitiler of tile parties. Htileli' decision, wluchever way it is given, wlil, if it staJld5, finally dispose of dIe matter ill dispute, I tilinl<. tilat lor

tile pUIposes oj'tilese rules it is final. On tile otiler hand, if tileli' decision, if given ill one way, mil finally dispose of tile matter lil dispute, but, ifgiven ill dle odlel; mil allow tile action to go on, dlen I tillnk it is not final, but lilterlocutory.

11091 Fry, L..J. expounded dIe same test in the following words:

'/ conceive tilat aJl order is '!iI7al' only where it is made upon an appncation or odler proceedlilg wluch must, whedler such apphCation or otiler proceedlilg lilll or succeed, detennine dle action. Con versely, I thiIlK. tilaL an Older is iilterlocutOIY' where it CaJlIlOt be allinned dlat ill eltiler event the action will be detelmined Applyillg ti7IS test to tile present case, it IS obvious tilat tile Older here w.;JS made on aJI appilcation of which dIe result would not ill one event be fiIlal. Therefore, thIS IS aJl 'interlocutory order.

11101 Lopes, L. J. enunciated the same test, dlUs:

C A. (PI~IC) 206-2016 Appeal - PIIC Ratnapura ~~ -2016- M.e. llatnapura 583~9-2016

"I dllilK dlat a judgment or order would be final within the meaning of the rules, when wlllchever way it went, it would finally detennine the rights of the parties .

Bozson Test-'order approach'-order fmally disposing of the rights of the

parties

11111 In Bozson v. Altnilcham Urban Di5trict CounCIl, (1903) 1 KB 517,

Lord Alverstone, C. J. then proceeded to lay down the test in d1e following

words:

"It seems to me dlat the real test for detelmining dlls question ought to be dll:s: Does die jlld!pnent or OIdel; as made finally dispose ot tlie lights otdle p;u1ies? [tit does, dlen [ dlinK it ought to be treated as a final ordel7 but If'it does not, it IS dlen, in my oplillon, an intedocutOlY OIdel: "

Salter Rex & CO. v. Ghosh-Application Approach

11121 Denning L.J in SalterRex& Co. v. Gbosh (supra) having considered

varying approaches finally adopted d1e 'application approach' and stated at

page 866:

"77lere is a note Ii) die Supreme Cowt Practice 1970 under RSC Ord. .59. R4, fi-om which it appea.r.5 dlat different tests have been stated fivm Dine to Dille as to what, IS final and what IS IntedocutOlY ............ [n StandaId Discount Co. v. La Grange l8773

11131 It may be noted at this stage that the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in

.'J: R~lielldra Clu:llJ;u' aJld a/hen fl. S. N;u<{JillJan Chellliv' ;Uld a/hers and

DOllil Padma Pnjf;UlIiIl' v. H .C. Ch;u7IIka.layantha and IJIIO 01171"/:5 (supra),

had adopted the 'application approach' followed in Salaman v. Wamer

(supra) and Salter Rex & Co. v. Ghosh (supra). The approach adopted by

our Supreme Court in these two cases was that "when whichever way the

order went., it would finally determine the rights of dIe parties, ilien, ilie

order is final and if it would not, it is ilien, an interlocutory order".

II 141 It is apt to refer to Atkin's Court Forms, Volume (2nd Edition),

which distinguishes an interiocutOlv order from a final order at page 297 as

follows:

II lSI It is to be noted dlat expressions identical to Article 154 (6) of die Sri

Lankan Constitution are used in Article 133 of the Indian Constitution,

which provides drat an appeal shall lie to the Supreme COUIt from 'any

'judgment., decree or final order' in a civil proceeding of a High Court

Article 134 provides iliat an appeal shall lie to dIe Supreme Court from

any ~udgment., final order or sentence' in a criminal proceeding of a High

Court. In intelvreting dIe expressions in Article 133 (I), Chagla, C.]., held

11161 In Savilli Devi v. R,ljul Devi and odlers (supra), Mootham, C,J.

having adopted the above-mentioned different tests adopted in die

aforesaid dlree English Cases observed:

"Article 133 of dIe ConslIlulIon of India is dIe representalIve of SeclIon 20.5 of dIe COllllS OrdlilaJlCe It was, dlerefore, a plVduct of die draiismanship ofJwist5 steeped in English law. 77le li<llners of Article 133 of dIe Con.5lIlulIOn of fildia must have had dIe provi5JOJ1S of SeclIon 205 of dIe Govel71J11ent of India Act, 193.5, present belore theli eyes. 77le Courts IiI Inrk1 have, dlere/ore, fi-eely

11171 In die result, die order refusing notice, calUlOt be a "final order"

according to the test laid down in Sal;un;ll1s case, which was reaflirmed by

Denning L,J in Saiter Rex & Co. v. Gosh (supra), because aldlOugh it went

in favour of one of die parties, if die order was given in die odler way, it

would allow die application to go on radler dIan ending the application and

finally disposing of die rights of die p<u1:ies. The mere fact dlat a cardinal

point in the suit has been decided or even a vital and important issue

determined in the case, is not enough to make die order a final one.

11181 Mr. Wanigapura however, argued dlat in me absence of any legal

provision eidler in die Constitution or die High Court of die Provinces

(Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990, me Appellant could not have filed

a leave to appeal application like under section 754 (2) of die Civil

COUIt from any final judgment, tinal order, decree or sentence or any

11201 The High Court has made the order in question in the exercise of its

revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution and

the Supreme Court has held in CunaralI1e v. Thamblilayagam and odJeJ:5

(supra) that section 9 of Act No. 19 of 1990 does not give a right of appeal

lo dIe Supreme Court liom an order of dIe High Court in the exercise of

its revisionary jurisdiction.

11211 The Supreme Court 111 Abeygllnasekera v. Sedlllnga aJld otheJ:5

(supra) has however, held dlat dIe Appellate jurisdiction of dIe Court of

Appeal under Article 138(1) read with Article 154P(6) of dIe Constitution

is not limited to correcting errors committed by the High Court only in

respect of orders given by way of an appeal and the Court of Appeal has

jurisdiction to hear an appeal against a decision of the High Court whedler

given by way of an Appeal or Revision.

11221 However, a bench consisting of 5 Judges of dIe Supreme Court did

not follow dlis decision in Abeywardene v. AJidl de Silva (supra) and held

that section 9 of dIe Act No. 19 of 1990 does not give a right of appeal to

C A. (I'HC) 200-2016 Appeal - I'lle Ratllapura ~~-2016- M.e. Ratnapum 583~9-20 1 6

the Court of Appeal from an order of the High Court: in the exercise of its

appellate jurisdiction. Ananda CoomaraswanlY, J. held at page 139:

"17le cumulative elfect of dIe provisions of AJticle 154P (3) (b),

154P(6) and section 9 of Act No. 19 of 1990 is that, while dlere is a

/123/ Similarly, in Wickremasekera v. Oflicer-lil-Charge, Police StatiOIl,

AmpaJd (2004) 1 Sri LR 264, Shirani Bandaranayake j. (as she then was)

has taken the sanle view and held at page 267:

"The Court olAppea1 does not have appeUate jUl7sdictioll in terms

/1 24/ Willie contimling the position that when the High Court: exercises

appellate jurisdiction, an appeal lies to die Supreme COUIt alter first having

obtained leave, Priyasadl Dep J. (as lie then was) held in MudldlUsamy

Balag-dlleshaJl v. 17le Oflicer-in-Cbarge, Police Statioll, SeeduW<l S.C.

judgment of the High Court exefClsmg Appellate Jurisdiction of the

Supreme COUIt in the first instance instead to the COW"t of Appeal ... "

11251 In the present case, the High Court has made the impugned order

while exercising it revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154P(3)(b) of the

Constitution and thus, the Appellant could not have filed a Special Leave

to Appeal application to the Supreme Court against the impugned

interiocutOIY order made by the High Court in the exercise of revisionary

jurisdiction under Article 154P(3)(b) of the Constitution. Hence, the

Appellant in the present case could not have filed an Appeal to the

Supreme Court against the order in question, with the leave of dIe High

COUIt fu"st had and obtained. On dIe odler hand, the Appellant could not

have filed a Special leave to Appeal application against the interlocutory

order made by dIe High COUIt in dIe exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction.

(g) Part I of the Court of Appeal (Procedure for Appeals from High

Courts) Rules is Complementary to Article 154P (6) of the Constitution

11261 Moreover, p,U"t I of the COUIt of Appeal (Procedure for Appeals

from High Courts) Rules 1988 is further complementary to Article 154P

(6) of the Constitution as the marginal note to Rule 2 (l) clearly refers to

dIe "right of appeal" to the Court of Appeal. Rule 2 (l) provides the

procedure to be followed in making appeals to dIe Court of Appeal from

any judgment, final order or sentence made by dIe High Court, in dIe

exercise of its appellate or revisionaIY jurisdiction under Article 154P (3)

(h) of dIe Constitution.

11271 It is to be noted dIat unlike PaIt I, Pm II of the said Rules relates to

dIe writ jurisdiction of dIe Provincial High Court. It provides that any

person dissatisfied widl "any order" made by the High Court, in dIe

exercise of dIe jurisdiction vested in it by Article 1511' (4) of dIe

C A. (I'IIC) 200-2016 Appelll - PIlC RlItn"pu .. a 44-2016- M.e. Ratnapu .. a 58349-2016

Constitution, may prefer an appeal to dle Court of Appeal against such

order. "Any order" under PaIt II mus, includes aIly "interlocutory order"

made by dle High Court in dle exercise of jurisdiction under Article 154P

(4) of me Constitution.

11281 The teml "final order" has been used in Article 154P (6) aIld Rule 2

(I) of dle COUlt of Appeal (Procedure for Appeals from High COUlts)

Rules togedler wid"! dle term "judgment" aIld dms, some sort of finality

must be present in dle case of a 'final order" as opposed to all

"interlocutory order", if it is to be appealable under Article 154P (6) of d"!e

Constitution.

11291 It is only a "final order, judgment or sentence" dlat is referred to in

Article 154P (6) of dle Constitution dlat is appealable aIld all interlocutory

order would be excluded from dle category of a fmal order or judgment

referred to dlerein. Thus, all appeal against a High Court decision, in dle

exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (b) would lie to dle COUlt

of Appeal only when its decision aIllOunts to a "fmal order or judgment".

11301 An order of dle High Court aIllounts to a "final order" only if die

order puts to all end dIe suit aIld if aI-ter dle order, dle suit is still alive, i.e.,

in which me right is still to be determined, it will not be a "fi.nal order".

The order under appeal, whichever way it is given, does not staIld fmally

dispose of dle rights of dle paIties in dispute or ending dle dispute, but dle

order leaves dle rights of dle paIties to be determined by me Courts in dIe

ordimuy way.

11311 I aIll of dle opinion dlat dle order refusing notice dated 05.12.2016

made by me High Court is neidler a "fmal order" nor a "judgment" widlin

dle meaIling of dle expressions used in Article 154 (6) of die Constitution

of Sri Lanka. In dle result, I hold dlat no appeal would lie to dle Court of

C A_ (I'I-Ie) 200-2016 Appeal- PHC Ratnnpurn ~~-2016- M_e. I~atnapura S83~9-2016

Appeal under Article 154P (6) of the Constitution from any order retilsing

notice by the Provincial High Court in the exercise of its revisionary

jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution. Hence, the

second preliminary oQjection is answered in favour of the Respondent as

follows:

No appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from the order refusing notice

by the Provincial High Court within the meaning of Article 154P (6)

of dIe Constitution.

11321 Mr. Wickremasinghe invited us to reject the appeal and dismiss dIe

application by upholding the second preliminary objection while conceding

that dIe Appellant's only remedy against the order reiilsing notice would be

;l revision to the COlJl1 or Appeal under ;unended Article 138 or tlle

Constitution (see-wlitten submissions filed on behalf of dIe Respondent

06.03.2020 (pages 14-15). He submitted dlat the Court of Appeal in

of this judgment).

11331 However, Dehideniya./. acknowledged that the Comt of Appeal did

not have the opportunity of hearing dIe Appellant as dIe Appellant was

absent and unrepresented. Dehideniya]. remarked at page 5 as follows:

11341 When this matter was mentioned on 01.06.2020 in the presence of

both Counsel, Mr. Wanigapura, sought indulgence of this Court:, without

prejudice to his earlier submissions, to remedy a miscarriage of justice

caused to the Appellant due to fundamental rules of judicial procedure and

rules of natural justice being violated by the Respondent and the

Magistrate's Court by fraudulent acts and illegal orders.

11351 In support: of the contention, he submuittd that even in a situation

where the appeal is rejected, still, the Court: of Appeal is empowered to

exercise its revisionary jurisdiction ex mero motu, even though Ule

Appellant had not invoked Ule revisionary jurisdiction separately, as a grave

miscarriage of justice had been caused to the Appellant warranting the

intervention of Ule Court: of Appeal under Article 138 of the Constitution.

He had relied on Ule decisions in Sh,1heeed,1 Ulllil1,'1 ilI1d ilI10dler v. Hillllf,i

revision where no appeal lies, Mr. Wickremasinghe however, submitted on

01.06.2020 Ulat such powers could only be exercised in exceptional

situations. He submitted Ulat in Ule present case, ulis COUlt could not have

exercised the power of revision conferred on it by Article 138 of Ule

Constitution for Ule following reasons:

I. The Appellant could not have filed a reVlSlon application in Ule

Provincial High Court as A1ticle Is4(3)(c) of Ule Constitution does

not confer on Ule High COUIt revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

C A. (PHC) 200-2016 Appeal- PHC Ratnapura ~~-2016- M.e. Ratnapura 583~92016

an order made by a Ma/,ristrate's Court under section 10 of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979;

2. The Appell;mt could have filed a revision application under Article

138 of die Constitution in ule Court of Appeal instead of an appeal

which does not lie and ule failure to invoke ule revisionary

jurisdiction disentitles Ule Appellant to seek ule ext:raordiniUl'

remedy of revision from ule Court of Appeal;

3. The Appellant could have filed a writ application in ule Court of

Appeal under Article 140 of ule Constitution instead of filing ;m

Appeal in ule COUlt of Appeal, which does not lie under Article 154

(6) of ilie Constitution.

11371 He has submitted in ule furuler written submissions filed on

08.06.2020 Ulat (i) ule circumstances relied on by ule AppelliUlt ;u'e not

exceptional circllmst;mces w;uTiUlting ule intervention of ule Court of

Appeal even where a proper revision application had been 1iled; (ii) as no

revision application had been filed by ule Appell,mt, Ule COUlt of Appeal

CiUmot consider ule circumst,mces relied on by ule Appell;mt in illl appeal;

illld (iii) ule Appellilllt has f;tiled to comply wiul ule COUlt of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 iUld hence, to accept ule appeal as a

revision will open t1oodgates.

11 381 In ulis context, Ulis COUlt is now invited to consider ule following

Issues:

l. CiUl Ule COlut of Appeal exercise its revisioniUl' jurisdiction in

appropriate cases where no SI<1.tutOJl' appeal lies to ule Court of

Appeal from an order of Ule Provincial High COUltP

CA. (PIIC) 2002016 Appeal Pile Rat"a"ura ~~2016 ~I.c. Ratnapu .. " 583~9201(,

2. Can dIe Coun of Appeal exercise its revisiomuy jurisdiction in

appropriate cases where d1e Appellant had not invoked altemative

remedies, including d1e revisionary or writ jurisdiction of dIe Coun

of Appeal separately in terms of dIe COUlt of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules?

3. Has d1e Appellant pleaded exceptional circumstances in dIe Petition

of Appeal tiled in dlis Court and satisfy dlat dley amount to a a

miscalTiage of justice warranting dIe intervention of dIe Coun of

Appeal by way of revision?

11391 As noted, d1is Coun has already held dlat Article 154 (3) (c) of dIe

Constitution has conferred on dIe High Court revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of an order made by a Magistrate's Court under section 10 of dIe

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979. In d1e result, dIe

consideration of Mr. Wickremasinghe's frrst argument does not arise at

dlis stage of dIe jud!,'111ent.

11401 This Coun turdler accepted dIe argument of dIe Respondent dIal

Article 154(6) of dIe Constitution has not provided a right of appeal to d1e

COUlt of Appeal from dIe order refusing notice in a revision application

filed before dIe Provincial High Coun. i\'ow the question is whether tIle

Appell'U1t. could indulge die revisionary powers of dIe Court of Appeal lo

remedy a miscarriage of justice where no appeal lies to ule COUlt of Appeal

from the impu!,'lled order made by the High Court.

Revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal where no statutory appeal

lies

[141] The 13 Amendment to d1e Constitution anlended Article 138 (1) of

dIe Constitution and made d1e High COUlt of d1e Provinces subject to dIe

appellate jUlisdiction of dte Court of Appeal as noted earlier. It is not in

C A. ( I'I~I C) 200-2016 Appcal- PBe Ratna pura 44-2016- M.e. Ratnapu ra 58349-2016

dispute that sul~ je('lto tlte provisions of the Co]]stitution, or or any law, the

COUIt of Appeal has powers to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or in law which are committed by the

Provincial High COUIt in the exercise of its revisionry jurisdiction under

AIticle 154P (3)(b) of the Constitution.

11421 In this connection, I shall consider important judicial audlOrities on

d1e question whether a revision lies where no statutory right of appeal has

been pro\~ded by d1e Legislature. It is trite law that the purpose of

conferring revisionary jurisdiction on the Court of Appeal is supervisory in

nature and d1at the object is the due administration of justice (Attomey-

General v. GunawiUdena 119961 2 Sri L.R. 149) in order to correct grave

failures or miscarriage of justice arising fi'Om erroneous or detective orders.

11431 Relief by way of revision had been granted by d1e fOllner Supreme

COUIt in cases where dlere was no appeal in d1e early case of RiUJasliJghe v.

HelllY I NLR 303 where d1e appeal was dismissed on the ground dlat no

appeal lies from a claim order made by die District COUIt. The Supreme

COUlt held dlat an order of the District Court, which is wrong ex facie, may

be quashed by d1e Supreme Court in die exercise of its revisionary power,

even though no appeal may lie against such order.

11441 In Attomey-General v. GllIlawiU'(lena (supra), San1arawickrema,

A.CJ. at page 156 stated:

"Revision, like iUl appeal, i5 directed towards dle correction of' envrs, but it is supervisOlY liJ /Jature iUld its object is dJe due AdmlnislJ<1tion o!.JuslJce iUld not, pnnwily or solely, the relievlilg of' gneviUICeS of'a party. An appeal is a remedy, whidJ a P,1J'ty who i5

11451 It is to meet such a situation where the legislature has not granted a

right of appeal to deal with proceedings which cannot be brought before

the Court by way of an appeal- eidler by way of a direct appeal or a leave to

appeal dlat Article 138 of dIe Constitution has conferred on ilie Court of

Appeal revisionary jurisdiction by making necessary orders as may be

necessary for ilie ends of justice where a miscaJTiage of justice has

occUlTed.

Limitations to ilie exercise of revisionary powers-error in the order and

exceptional Circumstances

11 ~.61 The revisionary powers, though, ;u'e quite wide, have heen

circumscribed by certain limitations. As dIe power of revision vested in dtis

COUlt is discretionary, dIe power will be exercised in cases where an appeal

or alternative remedies are available, only in exceptional cases. "nlere have

been a long line of cases which have held dlat dIe Court of Appeal will

exercise its extraordinary powers of revision only in cases where

exceptional circumstances are in existence warranting ilie exercise of such

powers irrespective of wheilier an appeal has been taken or not from dIe

judgment or order sought to be revised or ilie law provides alternative

remedies.

11511 The Courts have also held that in the absence of exceptional

circumsGU1ces, die mere fact dlat tl1e trial Judge's order is wrong is not a

growld for die exercise of tl1e revisionary powers of tl1e Court of Appeal

(Alima Natcbiar v. M anKar (1949) 47 N.L.R. 81). It is trite law dlat die

Court of Appeal would exercise its revisionary powers, whedler an appeal

or odler alternative remedy lies or not or whetl1er an appeal or alternative

remedy lies, but has been taken or not only where dlere are exceptional

circums(""1IlCes warranting die intervention of die Court.

Exceptional circumstances amounting In a positive miscarriage of justice

11521 The trends of audlOrities are also to die effect tl1at where exceptional

circwnsGU1ces are in existence, this extraordinary power will be exercised

by tl1e Court of Appeal, especially to prevent a miscarriage of justice being

done to a person and/or for die due administration of justice. In tl1e matter

of die Inso/vellCY of Hayman 77lOmiJi// (1895) 2 N.L.R. 105 and

SabapalilY v. Dun/op (1935) 37 N. L.R 113, it was held dlat where die

interests of justice demand it, die Cowt will not hesitate to act in revision.

In Rustom v. Hapangama & Co., (supra) Vytllialingant J. said "where an

order is palpahIy wrong and affects the rights of a party also, tl1is Court

would exercise its powers of revision to set aside die wrong irrespective of

whedler an appeal was taken or was available."

11531 In Perera v. MuliJahb 45 NLR 412, tl1e bond had been forfeited

widlOut an inquiry. Soertsz J. set out die revisionary powers of tl1e former

Supreme Cowt and held tl1at revisionary powers of the Supreme Court are

not limited to dlOse cases in which appeal lies or in which no appeal has

been taken for some reason. Soertsz,]. further stated at page 413 dlat die

Court would exercise revisionary powers where dlere has been a

miscarriage of justice owing In tl1e violation of a fundamental rule of

C A. (I' IIC) 200-2016 Appeal-PIIC RHtllapura ~~-2016- ~l.c. Rat"apum 583~9-2016

judicial procedure, but that this power would be exercised only when a

strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice.

11541 In Finnegal v. Galad;ui Hotels (Lwka) Ltd (1999) 2 Sri LR 272), it

was urged filter ;ilia, that the order suspending the eqjoining order issued at

the instance of die defendant, widlOut giving die plaintiff an opportunity of

being heard was an exceptional circumstance warranting die intervention of

die Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court held dlat dIe plaintiff was

questioning die legality of that order on fundamental issues, including die

failure to hold a fair inquiry amongst odler dlings and were exceptional

circumstances warranting die exercise of die revisionary jurisdiction of die

Court of Appeal.

11551 In Attomey-Genefal v PodisfilgilO 51 NLR 385, Dias S.P,}. identified

certain exceptional circumstances under which revisionary jurisdiction is

exercised. Dias S.P,J. at page 390 held that "an application in revision

should not be entertained save in exceptional circumstances. In my view

such exceptional cicumst;U1ces would be-

(a) where diere has been a miscarriage of justice;

(a) where a strong case for interference of this Court has been made our by die petitioner; or

(b) where die applicant was unaware of die order made by die Court of trial.

diese grounds are, of course, not intended to be exhaustive". (emphasis added)

11561 In VaJ)ik Incorporation Ltd v. Jayasekera (1997) 2 Sri LR 365,

Edussuriya, J. held at page 369 dlat aldlOugh some of the cases were

decided long before die present Constitution was promulgated and

anlendment to section 753 of die Civil Procedure Code, die Pith and

substance of die Supreme COUlt cases is dlat revision;uy powers should be

C A. (I'IIC) 200-2016 App"al- Pile R'"llllpura 44-2016- M.e. RatnapunI 58349-2016

execised where a positive nllscamage of justice has occun'ed due to a

fundamental rule of judicial procedure being violated,

11571 In the Indian case of CaetaJlO Colaco v. Joao Rodrigues, AIR 1966

Goa, Dan1aI1 and Diu 32 (FB), the Court said as under 9:

'lt is lIue that die scope or..s. 435 of the Code is wIder in so far dlat dIe High Court C,111 cOl1SJder dIe cOlTeclI1ess, legality or plVpnely of aJly findlilg, sentence or order recorded or passu/, and as to die regularity of aJly plVceedlng of an inferior court, but even so, dus junsdiclIon IS not to be exerci5ed ill el'elY case oflnlpropnety or IJleg-dllly, unless it Gluses failure of justice.

eVIdence; c. where die matenaJ eVIdence of dIe parlIes IS not considered, aJld d. wherejudiClaJ dlscrelIonls exerCIsed arbitranJy orpelversely.

77lese instaJlces are illustralI'l'e aJld not exhauslI've. Each case must of necessity depend on dIe f;/Cls aJld drcumstallces of die paJ1iclllaJ' case before dIe cowt:

11581 I am of the ,';ew that ill a situation where no statutory appeal lies, the

Court of Appeal has wide powers to exercise the revisionaI)' powers in

favour of the AppellaI1t, if it appears to Court that a miscarriage of justice

arising from the order complained of has occurred due to a fundan1ental

rule of judicial procedure aI1d rules of natural justice being violated.

Does the failure to invoke the revisiol1aI)' jurisdiction with a fonnal application by an aggrieved party prevent the Court of Appeal from exercising its revisionaI)' powers ex mero motu?

11591 Mr. Wick.remasinghe concedes that the appropriate remedy for the

Appellant is to come by way of revision but submits that the failure to file a

C A, (I'I-IC) 200-2016 Appeal- PHC Ratnapura ~~-2016- M,e. Ratnapur. 583~9-2016

,

separate application and satisfy the existence of exceptional circumstances

amount~ to non-compliance with !lIe Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules 1990, !llat disenti!les to the Appellant to seek indulgence

of Court to exercise its revisionary powers.

11601 The practice Idlowed is that unless the Court of Appeal ,lCL~ cx IllCW

molu in (he int.erests of justice, it will ordinarily exercise its power of

revision when ;Ul aggTieved party makes ;Ul application under Article I ClR of

the Constitution. This position is conlirmed by \lV;masundera ./. 111

Rasheed Ali 1'. MolJallled Ali 19R I I Sri LR 2G2 (SC) at page 265 as

follows:

"Ordinarily. the Court will not interkre hy way of reVIew,

p;uticul;u'ly when the law has expressly !,riven an agrreived party all

alternative remedy such as (he right to Ii Ie a sep;u'ate action except

when non-interference will cause a denial of justice or irremediable

harm".

116/1 The revision;u)' jurisdiction of !lle Court of Appeal flows from

Article 138 of !lIe Constitution ,md it will be exercised on application made

by a party aggIieved or ex mem motu (on its own motion) in appropriate

cases, as ilie interests of justice may require. This power is exercised where

a fundamental rule of !lle judicial procedure or rules of natural justice

being violated in regard t.o which it could have o!lleIwise exercised its

powers of revision even !llOugh !lle Appellant has not invoked ilie

reVlSIOnal), jurisdiction. Provided, however, !llis power will only be

exercised where it appeal'S !llat strong special circumStaIlceS exist

amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice.

11621 It is settled law !llat !lIe revisionary jurisdiction IS supervIsory m

nature alld therefore, it is exercised in some cases by a Judge of Ills own

C A. (I'IIC) 200-2016 Appc,,1 - PIIC Rntnapu,,, ~4-20 16- M.e. Ratnapu .... 583~9-2016

motion, when it is satisfied that a miscarriage of justice has occurred and

unless the power is exercised, injustice will result. The following judicial

authorities confiml this position. In Man ;1lJ Beebee v. Seyed Moham ed 58

NLR 36, Sansoni C'} had clearly stated the reasons for the exercise of the

extraordinary power of revisionary jUIisdiction by Appellate Courts as

follows:

"171e power of revision is an extraordinaJY power which is quite liJdependent of and distIin"{ Ji-om dJe appeUate jurisdiction of d1JS

CouIt. Its object IS dJe due administration of justice aJJd dJe correction of elTors, sometimes committed by dlls Court ItseU; liJ order to avoId miscaJTiages of justIc:e. It is exercised in some cases by a Judge of ins OWIl motion, when an aggrieved person who m;lY not be a p;u1y to dIe action bnngs to his notice dIe /act that unless dJe power is exerosed llijUStICe will result "

11631 Furdler. in Sunil Chandra KUl1laI 1'. Veloo (200J) 3 S/7' LR .91,

(supra).

11641 Mr. W ickremasinghe is asking us to soicdy apply a degree of

teclmicality in dIe exercise of its power of revision ex m ero mol7J and

refuse any remedy which could have otherwise been granted if a separate

formal application had been filed by the Appellant in sO'ict compliance

widl dIe Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules.

C A, (!'He) 200-20 16 Appeal- PUC Ratllapura ~~-2016- M,e. Ratnapura S83~9-2016

11651 If that argument holds water, the Court of Appeal could not have

exercised it~ revisionary power ex more molu in die interests of justice

unless a fOlmal revision application is filed and fOlmal notice is issued in

strict compliance widl die Rules. In such case, ex mere molu powers

conJerred on die Court of Appeal under Article 138 of die Constitution to

be exercised in die interests of justice is of no signifiC<ll1ce and die Court is

powerless to remedy any f1agnU1t miscarriage of justice.

11661 I am unable to agree widl die submission of Mr. Wickremasinghe. I

do not see any such impediment. when die power of revision is exercised

ex melv motu in a lit and proper case where a positive miscaniage of

justice has occurred as observed by Dias S.P J. in Attomey General v.

Podislilgho (supra) at page 3~~ I:

"In des/i'e to pOlili out dmt IiI exercislilg its powers oFrevi5ion dJJ:5 COllff is not trammeled by technical I7Jles of ple,1dlilg and procedure. In doing so, this Court has power to act, whether it is set in motion by a party or not, and even ex mero motu. A .Judge oFdJls

11671 The legal position in India appears to be die same. In Popular

1168/ Relief by way of revision had been granted by the fOlmer Supreme

Court in cases where there is no appeal and even in the absence of a

separate application for revision. In the early case of RiUNlsIilghe v. H em y

1 NLR 303, the appeal was dismissed on the ground that no appeal lied

from a claim order made by the District Court, but the Supreme Court

took up the case in revision and quashed the order of the District Court,

which is ex Jacie wrong, in the exercise of its revisiomuy power, even

C A. (I'IIC) 200-2016 Appeal- "Be Ratllapura ~~-2016- M.e. Ratnapura 583~9-20J6

though no appeal lied against such order and in the absence of a separate

11691 In A. Slimadwlg;u)J fUld ;ulOdler v. ~: Meeramoh;udee// 60 NLR

C.A. 191/ 1997 (F) decided on 27.10.2011 , Gooneratne]. having held tllal

there was no right of appeal to tlle Claimant-Appellant against an order

made by tlle District Court under section 245 of the Civil Procedure Code,

nevertheless, acted by way of revision in the absence of a separate

application for revision. The Cowt of Appeal interfered with the order of

tlle District Court when it appeared tllat tllere was a miscarriage of justice

by tlle said order even tllOugh tlle Claimant-Appellant had an altemative

remedy wIder section 247 of tlle Civil Procedure Code. Gooneratne J. in

tlle course of his judgment at page 13 stated:

"As such, 1 have to take die VIew dlat dlele is no light of appeal to die ClaJizlaJlt-AppellaJlL Howevel; he would not have been WIiJlOut a remedy SInce recourse to sectJon 247 was available widuil a stipulated tJille (Jerer to ClleltJ;ll' v.

11731 In my view, the Court of Appeal has wide power to exercIse its

revisionary jUlisdiction in fit and a proper case ex mew motu as the

interests of justice may require, without ,my [onnal application filed by ,my

aggIieved party, I hold dlat when it is neceSSaIY to exercise such power in a

tit aIld proper case in dIe interests of justice aIld to remedy a miscarriage of

justice, the procedural aI1d technical fetters CaImot stop us from exercising

its ex meru motu power of revision even if aIly party has not moved dlis

COUlt dlerefoL

1171,1 In my view, dIe Court of Appeal will take up the matter on its own

where dlere are strong exceptional circumStaIIces aI110unting to a positive

miscaITiage of justice ,md its power by way of revision ought be exercised in

order to remedy a misGuTiage of justice being caused to all aggrieved PaIty,

even dlOugh such p;uty has not invoked the revisionaIY jurisdiction,

Will ilie exercise of revisionaIY power amounts to a second appeal in a

garb of revision where the appeal is rejected?

11751. The question has also been raised in Court, whedler dIe powers to

act in revision by dIe Court of Appeal ex mero motu is all exercise so as to

admit, by a side wind ,m appeal in a !,'Tab of a revision, when the legislature

has not given a light of appeal. It is significaIlt to refer to the following

statement made by S;unarawickrema A.CJ. on dIe identical question 111

Attomey-GeneraJ v. Gun,1w;uYiena at pages 158 aIld 161 (supra):

"We are aeeorrhilgly oldie VIew dlat dlls Court has die power to aet IiI reVlsioll IiI dlls mattel; IFit IS satJs/ied that adequate glVullds exi5t

dlat as dIere is llO appeal IiI dus matter, dIe power ofreVisioll must not be exerGsed by us so as to admit, bya side Wlild, an appeal.

(at i 58).

As we have Indicated e;utiel; we are not disposed to exerGse our powers ill revision to give, by a Side mild, all appe;u IiI a matter

where dlere IS no light of appeal. Accormilgiy, if what JoWlS liIVoived was no more dlall all eJ7w; we should not have been disposed to liltelfere. But ill dlls matter dIe contra velltioll of Section 212 (2) W'dS not teduucw but SUbStallll;1i alld mateJ7'ai, alld it !J,1S led to a

11761 The same principle has been lucidly explained by the Indiall

Supreme CoUlt IiI State of Kelwa v. Puttumana IUadl j adlavedall

Nalnboodiri(l 999) 2 see 452, PArrA] AIK,]., at paragraph 5 stated:

11771 The High COUlt had not gone into the merits of die complaint~ of

die Appellant on subst,U1tive matters and hence, die question of re-agitating

or re-appreciating die finality of ,U1y order will not aIise in dlis appeal. I

hold dlat when dlis COUlt is exercising its revisionaI)' powers ex mero

motu where a positive miscarriage of justice has occurred, it CaI1I10t be

construed as all attempt to admit by a side wind, all appeal in a grab of a

revision or to allow die AppellaIlt to have a second bite at die chen), to

repair his case and present a fresh case.

Is tllere any express prohibition for tlle Court of Appeal to consider tlle

present appeal as a revision?

11781 A filmier question has been raised in COUlt, whedler there is any

prohibition for dlis COUIt of Appeal to consider dlis appeal as a revision if

the right of appeal to the COUIt of Appeal has been expressly taken away

by die Legislature. If the right of appeaJ has been taken away bv explicit

words by the Lc!,,jslatllrc, it is not possihle to consider all appeal as a

revision as die COUIt had no jurisdiction to entertain such appeals that have

been expressly prohibited (see- the judgment of PriY,U1dla jayawardena j.

in Lakshman Ravendra Wataw;z/a, CkuimillJ/Dilxtor General, Board at

Investment at 51; ulIJkas v. Ch;lIJd;lIJa KarunatillJake ,wd OtheI:l" SC

Appeal 31/2009 and Sc Appeals 35-2009-78/2009 decided on 06.07.20 18).

11791 Section 10 (2) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7

of 1979 expressly prohibits all appeal from the decision of a Magistrate.

This prohibition does not apply to die present appeal. Even dlOugh a right

of appeal has not been graIl ted to die AppellaIlt against the impugned

order, the Legislature has not expressly prohibited a right of appeal against

die impugned interlocutory order.

11791 It is quite cle,u' dlat dlere is no prohibition in the present C;L~e to

consider all appeal as a revision if there aI'e strong exceptional

C A. (PIIC) 20020 16 Appcal - Pile Ratnapura ~~2016-1'1.C. Ralna pu,.a 583~9-2016

circwnstances amounting to a miscarriage of justice in order to remedy

such a miscarriage of justice even though no fomla1 application has been

filed by an aggrieved party.

Are there any exceptional circumstances amounting to a miscarriage of

Justice?

11801 The fmal question to be considered is whether there are exceptional

circumstances amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice calling for the

intervention of this Court by way of revision.

11811 Mr. Wanigapura drew our attention to a number of exceptional

circumstances pleaded by the Appellant in the Petition filed in the High

Court ,md the sanle pleaded in the Petition of Appeal addressed to the

Court of Appeal. Perusal of the Petition filed in this appeal reveals dlat dle

Appellant had clearly pleaded

dIe learned High COUlt./ udge:

I. The Respondent had not named die Appellant in dIe quit notice dated

21.09.2015 ;U1d dIe said quit notice had been sent to a person by die

name of Elaaddara Gedera Dasanayake who is not die Appell;U1t who is

Elaaddara Gedera Samaranayake (pages 34 ,U1d 69 or die brief);

C A. (PIIC) 2002016 Appeal.PIIC Ratllapunt 442016' 1\1.(;, Ratllapu .. a 583492016

2. The Respondent had filed the application in the Magistrate's Court

seeking to eject Elaaddara Gedera Dasanayake and no application for

the ejectment of the Appellant had been made by the Respondent

(pages 28, 33 and 55 of the brief);

3. The learned Magistrate had issued summons by registered post on the

said Elaaddara Gedera Dasanayake and the said summons had been

returned undelivered as per the minute of the Registrar (pages 29-30

and 70-72 of the brief);

4. The learned Magistrate had not issued summons on the Appellant

Elaaddara Gedera Samaranayake as he had not been named in the

application and the affidavit filed by the Respondent in the Magistrate's

Court (pages 29, 44, 70-72 of the brief);

5. The order of ejectment had been made only against the said Elaaddara

Gedera Dasanayake but the Appellant Elaaddara Gedera

Samaranayake had been ejected by the Fiscal without any order of

ejectment being made against the Appellant; (pages 44, 56 64-68 of the

brief);

6. As the record demonstrates, the Appellant was unaware of the order of

ejectment made by the Magistrate's Court prior to his ejectment by the

Fiscal Officer of the Magistrate's Court.

11831 I have carefully exanlined the petition of appeal filed by the

Appellant in this appeal and the identical petition filed by the Appellant in

the High Court. I anl satisfied that the Appellant has pleaded in the

petition of appeal strong exceptional circumstances amounting to a positive

miscarriage of justice due to fundamental rules of judicial procedure and

rules of natural justice being violated.

1184/ The Appellant had also brought to the notice of the learned High

Court Judge that he had no knowledge of Ule order of ~jectment made by

Ule lea.ll1ed Magistrate until Ule time he was ejected by ilie Fiscal Officer

and U1US, it was a violation of Ule fundamental IlJle of judicial procedure

Ulat a person who sought to be affected by an order shall lirst be heard.

The learned High Court Judge has failed to deal wiul any exceptional

circumstances and consider wheilier iliey are capable of affecting ilie

validity of the order of ejectment made by the learned Magistrate but

refused notice on an en'oneous assumption of law wiUl regard to Ule

principles laid down by Ule Supreme Court in Superintendent, Stafford

Estate and others v. Soliamuthu Rasu v. (supra).

11851 I anI of Ule view Ulat Ule failure of Ule learned High Court./udge to

consider ,my exceptional circumstances raised by ilie AppeU,mt in his

petition filed in Ule High COUlt has resulted in a flagrant miscarriage of

justice affecting ilie substantive rights of Ule Appellant wammting Ule

intervention of Ulis COUlt by way of revision. In ulis context, I hold Ulat Ule

revisiomu)' powers of Ule COUlt of Appeal ,u'e wide enough to embrace a

case of ulis nature to remedy a miscarriage of justice.

11861 The Respondent has already conceded iliat Ule appropriate remedy

for Ule AppeUant is to make an application for revision to ulis COUlt under

Article 138 of Ule Constitution ,md U1US, Ule Respondent will not be in any

manner prejudiced, when Ulis Court is exercising revisionary jurisdiction ex

mew motu, to remedy a misc;uTiage of justice.

11871 Accordingly, I anI inclined to consider Ule appeal as a revision and

exercise revision<u)' powers of ulis Court ex mew motu in favour of Ule

Appell,mt, even though the Appell'UlI. has not invoked Ule revisionalY

jurisdiction by way of a formal application. The le,U'I1ed High COllltJudge

must now determine whether tJle exceptional circumst<UlCes pleaded in the

C A. (I'IIC) 200-2016 Appcal- PIIC Ratllapura ~~ - 2016 - M.e. Ratllapu .. a 583~9-2016

petition filed by the Appellant in the High Court are capable of affecting

the validity of the order of ejectment made by the learned Magistrate in

terms of the provisions of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act No.

70f1979.

Conclusion

11881 For those reasons, I set aside the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the Sabaragarnuwa Province dated 05.12.2016 and direct the

leamed High COUIt Judge to determine the Appellant's reVISion

application filed in the Provincial High Court on its merits.
