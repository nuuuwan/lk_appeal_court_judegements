Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner trader filed this application seeking to quash by a

writ of certiorari the decision of the 1st Respondent, the

Consumer Affairs Authority, dated 27.11.2014 marked A18B,

made in terms of section 13(4) of the Consumer Affairs Authority

Act, No.9 of 2003. The decision was pursuant to an inquiry held

in terms of section 13(1) into a complaint lodged by the 2nd

Respondent consumer in respect of a motor vehicle purchased

from the Petitioner.

Learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent takes up a preliminary

objection to the maintainability of this application on the ground

that the supporting affidavit of the Petitioner filed with the

petition is defective, in that (a) the affidavit is typed on the

letterhead of the Attorney on record for the Petitioner, (b) the

alteration in paragraph 30 of the affidavit is not initialed by the

Justice of the Peace who attested it, (c) the Justice of the Peace

3

has signed the affidavit as a Commissioner for Oaths, and (d)

the residential address of the affirmant is not given in the

affidavit.

Although the affidavit is typed on the letterhead of the Attorney

on record, it has been affirmed to before a Justice of the Peace

who has placed his seal beneath his signature. The alleged

alteration in the affidavit, which is not at once visible, is not at

all on a material or contested point. The affirmant has deposed

to the facts as the General Manager (After Sales) of the Petitioner

company, hence the official address.

None of the said defects render the affidavit invalid, as they

are, if at all, relevant to the form and not the substance of the

affidavit. Such technical defects as to form can be cured by

application of section 9 of the Oaths and Affirmations Ordinance

(Pushpadeva v. Senok Trade Combine Ltd [2015] BLR 40, Facy v.

Sanoon [2006] BLR 58).

I overrule the said preliminary objection.

Before I consider the Petitioners case on its merits, there is a

preliminary issue to be addressed, though technical in nature,

which goes to the root of the matter. That is, the validity of the

impugned decision due to lack of quorum.

Item 8(2) of the Schedule to the Consumer Affairs Authority Act

(read with section 3(4) of the Act) says The quorum for any

meeting of the Authority shall be four members. Learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submits that when the

impugned decision A18B was purportedly made on 27.11.2014,

4

there was no quorum of the Authority in the eyes of the law to

make such a decision.

The Petitioner, tendering the inquiry proceedings dated

27.11.2014 marked A17B and drawing the attention of the

Court to page two thereof, says the inquiry was held before only

one member of the Authority, namely, Major General N.

Jayasuriya, whereas the Act requires that it be held before four

members.

In reply, the 1st Respondent Authority, tendering 1R7, says in

paragraph 18 of its statement of objections:

(a) At the inquiry held on 27.11.2014, two members of the

inquiry panel have left before placing their signatures to

the inquiry proceedings pertaining to that date.

(b) A copy of the proceedings of the inquiry dated

27.11.2014 containing the signature of only one member

of the inquiry panel has been served on the Petitioner

(c) The members of the inquiry panel who failed to place

their signatures as mentioned above have subsequently

placed their signatures to the inquiry proceedings

pertaining to that date.

I am unable to accept this flimsy explanation.

On the other hand, even if I were to accept this explanation,

according to page two of 1R7 dated 27.11.2014, only three

members of the Authority participated at the inquiry, whereas

the quorum is four members, not three.

5

However, the impugned decision A18B of the same date, i.e.

27.11.2014, has been signed by four members: the three

mentioned in 1R7 and another member, namely, Milton

Amarasinghe.

The signatures of four members have been added to the decision

to give it artificial validity in terms of quorum. The quorum

requirement, which goes to the very foundation of the decision,

is not curable by merely placing four signatures to the decision if

all four signatories did not participate in the decision-making

process, i.e. the main inquiry.

Learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent, in his ingenuity, takes

up the following position:

The quorum as stated in the Schedule to the Act is

applicable only for the meetings of the Consumer Affairs

Authority itself and therefore is not per se applicable to any

inquiries held in terms of the other operative sections of the

Act.

I place on record my appreciation for the innovative thinking of

learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent. He makes a distinction

between meetings and inquiries of the Authority, and contends

that the quorum is necessary only for the former and not the

latter.

In elucidating his argument, learned Counsel refers to section

3(4) which says The provisions of the Schedule to this Act, shall

have effect in relation to the term of office of the members of the

Authority, the meetings and seal of the Authority, and item 8(2)

6

of the Schedule to the Act which says The quorum for any

meeting of the Authority shall be four members.

Let me now have a closer look at this novel argument.

Section 8 of the Act lists the functions of the Authority. Item (f)

thereof says The functions of the Authority shall be to carry out

investigations and inquiries, in relation to any matter specified in

this Act.

There is no dispute that the inquiry was held and the decision

made under section 13(1) and 13(4) of the Act respectively.

Section 13(1) reads as follows:

The Authority may inquire into complaints regarding

(a) the production, manufacture, supply, storage,

transportation or sale of any goods and to the

supply of any services which does not conform to

the standards and specifications determined

under section 12; and

(b) the manufacture or sale of any goods which does

not conform to the warranty or guarantee given by

implication or otherwise, by the manufacturer or

trader.

Section 13(4) reads as follows:

Where after an inquiry into a complaint, the Authority is of

opinion that a manufacture or sale of any goods or the

provision of any services has been made which does not

conform to the standards or specifications determined or

7

deemed to be determined by the Authority, or that a

manufacture or sale has been made of any goods not

conforming to any warranty or guarantee given by

implication or otherwise by the manufacturer or trader, it

shall order the manufacturer or trader to pay compensation

to the aggrieved party or to replace such goods or to refund

the amount paid for such goods or the provision of such

service, as the case may be.

Hence, there is no doubt that holding an inquiry and making a

decision thereon is a function of the Authority.

Who is the Authority?

Section 2(1) enacts:

An authority called the Consumer Affairs Authority

(hereinafter referred to as the Authority) is hereby

established which shall consist of the persons who are for

the time being members of the Authority under section 3.

Section 3(1) and (2) provide:

3(1) The Authority shall consist of a Chairman and not less

than ten other members who shall be appointed by the

Minister from among persons who possess recognized

qualifications, have had wide experience and have

distinguished themselves in the field of industry, law,

economics, commerce, administration, accountancy, science

or health.

8

(2) The Chairman and three of the members, selected by the

Minister from among the members appointed under

subsection (1), shall be full time members (hereinafter

referred to as full time members of the Authority).

If the argument of learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent is to

be accepted, the inquiry shall be held and the decision taken by

all members of the Authority, for the quorum would be

applicable only to meetings and not to inquiries. Then the

impugned inquiry and the decision thereon become ultra vires.

The word meeting is not defined in the Act.

Any argument that an inquiry can be held and a decision taken

by even one member of the Authority sitting alone is plainly

unacceptable.

The initial argument that the requirement of the quorum is

necessary only in respect of meetings but not inquiries is proved

unsustainable by the next argument of learned Counsel for the

2nd Respondent himself.

Learned Counsel, in the latter part of his submission, makes

another distinction between an inquiry which involves policy

decisions affecting the entire public and/or an industry as a

whole, and an inquiry between two parties on a particular issue,

such as the sale of a finished product. He submits that the

quorum is required in the case of the former but not in the case

of the latter. In explaining further, he says the quorum is

required in section 18 inquiries but not in section 13 inquiries.

But the Act does not support this argument.

9

This argument goes to show that it is not the position of learned

Counsel that meeting excludes inquiries.

Section 18, like section 13 (which I have already quoted), only

speaks of inquiries and decisions of the Authority. Section 18

does not speak of meetings of the Authority or the quorum for

such meetings. There is no significant difference between a

section 13 inquiry and section 18 inquiry, although the

magnitude of the subject matter may differ. Nonetheless, the

applicability of the governing principles of law and procedure

remain the same.

Let me quote section 18 for better understanding:

18(1) Where the Minister is of opinion that any goods or any

service is essential to the life of the community or part

thereof, the Minister in consultation with the Authority may

by Order published in the Gazelle prescribe such goods or

such service as specified goods or specified service as the

case may be.

(2) No manufacturer or trader shall increase the retail or

wholesale price of any goods or any service specified under

subsection (1), except with the prior written approval of the

Authority.

(3) A manufacturer or trader who seeks to obtain the

approval of the Authority under subsection (2), shall make

an application in that behalf to the Authority, and the

Authority shall, after holding such inquiry as it may

consider appropriate:

10

(a) approve such increase where it is satisfied that

the increase is reasonable; or

(b) approve any other increase as the Authority may

consider reasonable,

and inform the manufacturer or trader of its decision

thirty days of the receipt of such application.

(4) Where the Authority fails to give a decision within thirty

days of the receipt of an application as required under

subsection (3), the manufacturer or trader who made the

application shall be entitled to, notwithstanding the

provisions of subsection (1), increase the price:

Provided however, where the delay in giving its decision

within the stipulated period was due to the failure of the

manufacturer or trader to give any assistance required by

the Authority in carrying; out its inquiry into the application,

the Authority shall have the power to make an interim order

preventing the said manufacturer or trader from increasing

the price, until the Authority makes its decision on the

application.

I am unable to accept the argument that the quorum is

necessary only if the inquiry deals with a matter affecting a large

section of society but not when the inquiry deals with the rights

of two individual parties. There are no private inquiries before

the Consumer Affairs Authority. All inquiries relate to public

matters to which the same laws and procedures apply.

11

It is not correct to say section 18 relates to a core function of

the Consumer Affairs Authority whereas section 13 does not. As

I stated earlier, section 8 of the Act recognises that one of the

functions of the Authority is to carry out investigations and

inquiries, in relation to any matter specified in this Act.

Learned Counsel refers to sections 6, 66, 67 and items (n) and

(o) of section 8 to emphasise that the functions of the Authority

(including conducting inquiries) can be delegated even to a

single public officer, be it the officers and staff of the Authority

or servants and advisers of the Authority. He highlights this to

argue that there is no uniformity in the applicability of the

quorum, in that an inquiry can be held by even a single officer.

He nevertheless later admits [inquiries] under section 18 of the

Act which is a specific function of the Consumer Affairs Authority

cannot be delegated under the general delegation provisions

elsewhere in the Act.

As much as section 18 is identifiable as a specific function of the

Authority, so too is section 13. An inquiry under section 13 and

a decision thereon cannot be delegated under the general

delegation of powers to public officers. In such inquiries, the

Authority exercises judicial or quasi-judicial powers, which

cannot be delegated. The Authority can delegate powers in

respect of investigations to obtain expert opinion etc. but not in

respect of the main inquiry per se.

In Shell Gas Lanka Ltd. v. Consumer Affairs Authority [2007] 2 Sri

LR 212, which is a case involving a complaint in terms of section

18 of the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, it was held at 214-215

12

that the power conferred on the Authority by statute must be

lawfully exercised by the Authority itself:

It is essential that for the lawful exercise of power, it should

be exercised by the 1st Respondent [Consumer Affairs}

Authority upon whom such power is conferred and by no

one else. The extent of permissible delegation will, of

course, have to be determined with reference to the terms of

the statute, because if the delegation exceeds the limits set

out by the statute it will be ultra vires leading to the

invalidity of the act done by the delegate. I am unable to

agree with the learned Senior State Counsel that the

powers of the Authority can be delegated to the Pricing

Committee. The Pricing Committee may facilitate the

discharge of the functions of the Authority. But, the Pricing

Committee has no jurisdiction to exercise the powers of the

Authority. The Act section 6 provides the delegation of

powers to Public Officers only. A statutory power to

delegate functions will not necessarily extend to everything.

Thus, it has been held in the case of General Medical

Council v U.K. Dental Board) that the General Medical

Council must itself exercise its disciplinary powers over

Dentists and cannot delegate them on to an Executive

Committee for the purpose of its functions under Dentists

Act.

This principle is also discussed in Wades Administrative Law

(11th Edition) at p.259:

13

An element which is essential for the lawful exercise of

power is that it should be exercised by the authority upon

whom it is conferred, and by no one else. The principle is

strictly applied, even where it causes administrative

inconvenience, except in cases where it may reasonably be

inferred that the power was intended to be delegable.

Normally the courts are rigorous in requiring the power to

be exercised by the precise person or body stated in the

statute, and in condemning as ultra vires action taken by

agents, sub-committees or delegates, however expressly

authorised by the authority endowed with the power.

Hence, learned Counsels submission that the Authority can

delegate to public officers its power to conduct inquiries under

section 13 is unsustainable.

The quorum is not necessary for all functions of the Consumer

Affairs Authority, including investigative functions, but it is

necessary for meetings, which include formal inquiries

culminating in final decisions.

Learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent strenuously submits

that the participation of four members at all inquiries (per the

quorum requirement) is not practical and, if insisted upon,

would cripple the smooth functioning of the Authority. I cannot

agree. The Act provides that the Authority shall consist of a

Chairman and not less than ten members. According to the

Annual Report of 2014 of the Authority found on its official

website, the Authority had 33 members at the end of 2014 (the

14

impugned decision was made on 27.11.2014). This number did

not include officers, staff, aids, advisers etc.

For the aforesaid reasons I hold that the impugned decision

A18B is a nullity, as it has not been made by a properly

constituted panel of inquiry as required by law. In other words,

the decision has no force or avail in law due to the lack of

quorum.

In view of the above finding, there is no necessity to go into the

merits of the application.

I grant the reliefs to the Petitioner as prayed for in paragraphs

(b)-(d) of the prayer to the petition. Let the parties bear their

own costs.

Before I part with this Judgment, I must place on record my

displeasure at how members of the Consumer Affairs Authority

act in discharging their professional duties. This Court has, in

the recent past alone, quashed several decisions of the Authority

on the basis of lack of quorum. It is regrettable that it is

consumers who are at the receiving end of these decisions of

Court and not members of the Authority who draw their salaries

from the taxpaying public, including the said consumers. I hope

the subject Minister will make serious note of the matter and

take immediate steps to remedy this situation.
