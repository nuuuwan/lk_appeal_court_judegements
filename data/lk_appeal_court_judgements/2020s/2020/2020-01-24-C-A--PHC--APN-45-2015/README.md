This is a case where this Court has to decide whether the Petitioner has to obtain

sanction of the Attorney General when the Petitioner files a revision application. In a

revision application, the Petitioner is not required to obtain the sanction of the Attorney

General as in an appeal. Therefore, this Court decides that the learned High Court Judge

has erred in deciding that in a revision application the Petitioner has to obtain the

sanction of the Attorney General. Accordingly, the order of the learned High Court

Judge is set aside and send this case back to High Court of Panadura for the purpose of

hearing the revision application afresh.
