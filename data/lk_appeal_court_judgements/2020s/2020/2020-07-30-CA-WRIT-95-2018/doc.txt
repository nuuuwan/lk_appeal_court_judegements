Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.

Counsel: Senany Dayaratne with Nishadi

Wickramasinghe for the Petitioner.

Chathura Galhena with Manoja Gunawardana

for the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

Madubashini Sri Meththa, S.C., for the 3rd-

10th Respondents.

Argued on: 17.07.2020

Decided on: 30.07.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The two permits marked P2 and P3 were issued in 1984 to R.

Wijeratne, the Petitioners father, under the Land Development

Ordinance, in respect of the land in dispute, which comprises

high land and paddy land. At the time, Wijeratne was married to

B. H. N. Gunawathie, the Petitioners mother. The Petitioner is

one of many children of that union. Wijeratne legally divorced

Gunawathie in 1991 and married the 1st Respondent in 1992.

When Wijeratne died on 01.06.1995, the 1st Respondent was his

lawful spouse.

4

It is not explicitly clear from P2 and P3 whether the 1st

Respondent was the nominated successor to the land at the time

of Wijeratnes demise. In any event, whether or not the spouse of

the permit holder is nominated as the successor, in terms of

section 48A(1) of the Land Development Ordinance, the spouse

of the permit holder is entitled to succeed to the land. However,

according to subsections (1) and (2) of section 68, a spouse or a

nominee, respectively, who does not enter into possession of the

land within six months of the death of the permit holder fails to

succeed to the land. The Petitioner says the 1st Respondent, by

her own admission, did not enter into possession of the land

within the said period.1 In my view, it is too late in the day for

the Petitioner to challenge the succession of the 1st Respondent,

as the 8th Respondent recognised the 1st Respondent as having

succeeded to the land in 1996.2

According to section 46(1) and (2), without the written consent of

the Government Agent, the permit holder is debarred from

disposing of the permit land. In terms of section 46(3), if the

permit holder does so, such disposition is null and void. In

terms of section 48A(3), if the spouse does so upon succession,

the result is the same.

The Petitioner by tendering inter alia P8 and P12 alleges the 1st

Respondent sold the land in dispute to third parties for valuable

consideration. By P8, ex facie, the high land was sold to a third

party. By P12, ex facie, the paddy land was sold to the 2nd

Respondent. The 1st and 2nd Respondents deny this allegation.

1 Vide page 111 of the Brief. 2 Vide the endorsements on pages 42, 44 of the permits, and also pages 207-210 of the Brief.

5

The fact that the land has been sold by the 1st Respondent is

acknowledged by the 6th Respondent by P11 and P16, and by

the 8th Respondent by P19 and P22. The documents such as

P17(a), P17(b), P21(a) and P21(b) demonstrate that the Petitioner

and his deceased elder brother, Jayantha Wimalasiri, had been

repeatedly complaining to the relevant authorities about this

disposition. They had also insisted that steps be taken to cancel

the authority given to the 1st Respondent to possess the land

and to issue permits in respect of the land in the name of the

Petitioner instead.

In the meantime, in 1999, the 1st and 2nd Respondents filed a

case in the District Court against the Petitioner and some

others, stating that the latter had prevented the 2nd Respondent,

whom the 1st Respondent says is her agent, from cultivating the

disputed paddy land in the 1996 yala season, and seeking a

declaration that the 1st Respondent is the permit holder of the

land. As seen from P19 and P22, it is because of this District

Court action that the authorities did not take steps in respect of

the Petitioners complaint.

As I have already explained, according to sections 46(3) and

48A(3) of the Land Development Ordinance and condition No.13

of the permit, the said disposition of the land by the 1st

Respondent, if it has actually taken place, has no force or avail

in law. Furthermore, such an act by the 1st Respondent would

give rise to the cancellation of the permit or her authority to

possess the land, of course, subject to the proper procedure

being followed, as laid down in Chapter VIII of the Ordinance.

6

In my view, it was wrong on the part of the 3rd-8th Respondents

to have shirked their statutory duty to hold an inquiry into the

complaint of the Petitioner and make a determination on the

matter in terms of the Land Development Ordinance. The

District Court action could not have been a bar to it.

I must also mention the District Court has no jurisdiction to

inquire into the cancellation of a permit, as there is a special

procedure laid down in the Land Development Ordinance

governing this matter. However, I must add, the District Court

action was not in relation to any attempt to cancel the permit,

but rather against the eviction of the 2nd Respondent from the

paddy land.

During the pendency of the District Court action filed by the 1st

Respondent, the Petitioner filed this application in this Court

seeking predominantly to quash by certiorari the decision of any

one or more of the 3rd-8th Respondents to issue a permit to the

1st Respondent in respect of the paddy land or, in the

alternative, to compel the said Respondents by mandamus to

cancel the permit already issued to the 1st Respondent. In

addition, the Petitioner seeks to compel the said Respondents by

mandamus to issue a permit to the said land to the most

suitable person in terms of the law. If the Petitioners complaint

is proven, succession shall be decided in terms of section 72

read with Rule 1 of the Third Schedule to the Land Development

Ordinance.

7

Section 72 reads as follows:

If no successor has been nominated, or if the nominated

successor fails to succeed, or if the nomination of a

successor contravenes the provisions of this Ordinance, the

title to the land alienated on a permit to a permit-holder

who at the time of his or her death was paying an annual

instalment by virtue of the provisions of section 19 or to the

holding of an owner shall, upon the death of such permit-

holder or owner without leaving behind his or her spouse,

or, where such permit-holder or owner died leaving behind

his or her spouse, upon the failure of such spouse to

succeed to that land or holding, or upon the death of such

spouse, devolve as prescribed in rule 1 of the Third

Schedule.

Rule 1 of the Third Schedule stipulates:

a) The groups of relatives from which a successor may be

nominated for the purposes of section 51 shall be as set out

in the subjoined table.

b) Title to a holding for the purposes of section 72 shall

devolve on one only of the relatives of the permit-holder or

owner in the order of priority in which they are respectively

mentioned in the subjoined table, the older being preferred

to the younger where there are more relatives than one in

any group.

According to the Table, the order of priority is: (i) Sons (ii)

Daughters (iii) Grandsons (iv) Granddaughters (v) Father (vi)

8

Mother (vii) Brothers (viii) Sisters (ix) Uncles (x) Aunts (xi)

Nephews (xii) Nieces.

Without a proper inquiry, this Court cannot grant the reliefs

sought by the Petitioner. Such an inquiry cannot be held by the

writ Court but by the authorities identified in the Land

Development Ordinance.

The 3rd-10th Respondents in their amended statement of

objections and written submission have clearly stated the

conduct of the 1st Respondent is illegal, as she has breached the

conditions in the permit and illegally transferred the land to

third parties. The said Respondents have also admitted therein

that there was a delay and an oversight in the actions of the

relevant authorities in looking into this matter. The 5th

Respondent Director General of Mahaweli Authority reiterates

the foregoing in no uncertain terms in his supporting affidavit.

However, in the written submission, the said Respondents admit

that cancellation of a permit can only be done after a proper

inquiry.

There is a misconception that in judicial review, this Court

cannot give directions to authorities on what to do and how to

do so. In Wickremasighe v. Chandrananda de Silva, Secretary

Ministry of Defence [2001] 2 Sri LR 333 at 353, Gunawardena J.

held:

[U]nder the judicial review procedure the court exercises a

supervisory jurisdiction. A court exercising such supervisory

powers can inspect and even direct. Under the judicial

review procedure, far from being confined to the matters

9

averred in the petition, the court is less inhibited and is free

to adopt a more interventionist attitudenot with a view to

withholding or denying relief but with a view to grant it

when justice of the case demands that such a course of

action be adopted.

All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union v. Nestle

Lanka Ltd [1999] 1 Sri LR 343 is a case where an Arbitration

Award was quashed by this Court by a writ of certiorari on the

ground of an error on the face of the record. Having done so,

Jayasuriya J. made the following direction:

We direct and order the Honourable Minister of Labour to

make another reference in terms of section 4(1) of the

Industrial Disputes Act No.14 of 1957 as amended

appointing another arbitrator to settle the aforesaid dispute

by arbitration. This direction is made in view of the

principle laid down by Justice Sharvananda in the decision

in Nadaraja Ltd. v. Krishnadasan 78 NLR 255 which is

referred to and adopted in Shell Gas Company v. All Ceylon

Commercial & Industrial Workers Union [1998] 1 Sri LR

118 at 124.

It is an established rule in law that the greater includes the

less.3

Therefore, although this Court cannot at this juncture grant the

reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner, I direct the 5th Respondent to

hold an inquiry with the participation of all stakeholders,

3 Ibralebbe alias Rasa Wattan (1963) CLW 41 at 43 (PC) per Viscount Radcliffe.

10

including the Petitioner and the 1st and 2nd Respondents, and

make a suitable order in terms of the law.

The only submission made by the 1st and 2nd Respondents is the

application of the Petitioner shall be dismissed in limine on the

ground of delay. In my view, in the facts and circumstances of

this case, such a submission cannot succeed. As I have stated

above, the Petitioner repeatedly took up this matter with the

proper authorities, but the 3rd-8th Respondents kept on

postponing the holding of an inquiry and failed to make an

appropriate decision, due to the case filed by the 1st Respondent

in the District Court.

The application of the Petitioner is partly allowed. No costs.
