The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) by application dated 17/08/2012, filed an action in terms of Section

28A (3) of the Urban Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 (as amended) in

the Magistrates Court of Ratnapura against the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) for constructing an unauthorized building

at No. 39/B, Bus Stand Road, Kuruwita.

In the proceedings before the Magistrates Court, the Appellant took up the

position that her husband entered into a Lease Agreement with Sri Lanka Railway

Page 2 of7

Department (not pleaded in Court proceedings) to the land where the house to be

demolished stands, and produced documents marked "vi" to "v4" in support. The

learned Magistrate by order dated 07112/2012, found that the said documents have

no relevance to the land in question and accordingly, authorized the demolition of

the building on the basis that the Appellant has failed to produce a valid permit in

terms of Section 28A (1) of the Act. The Appellant thereafter, filed a revision

application against the said order in the Provincial High Court of Ratnapura and

the learned High Court Judge by order dated 25/06/2015, upheld the Order of the

learned Magistrate and dismissed the application for want of exceptional

circumstances. The Appellant is before this Court to challenge the said order.

When this case was pending before this Court the Appellant made an

application under Article 139 (2) of the Constitution to receive and admit as new

and additional evidence of documents marked "Ala"- "AS". The Applicant relied

on the dicta laid down by Lord Denning L.J. in Ladd Vs. Marshall (1954) 3 AFR

745 in support of his application.

In the application to receive additional evidence made under Article 139(2)

of the constitution, the Appellant mainly relied on a letter which is unsigned

marked "A2", issued by the Department of Local Government of Sabaragamuwa

Provincial Council informing the Secretary of the said Council that rates have

been paid in respect of Assessment No. 39/B for the year 1988. The said letter,

inter alia, confirms that there is no approved development plan in respect of the

Page 3 of7

said construction. The Appellant also relies on Gazette Notifications No. 821123,

dated 02/06/1994 and No. 1629116, dated 2611112009, marked "AI" to assert that

the construction to be demolished was carried out before the area was declared as

an Urban Development Area in 1994. Documents marked "A3a" to "A3r" are

certified copies of electoral register extracts for the years 1993-2010 for

assessment bearing No. 680A, which the Appellant contends was issued to the

disputed premises bearing No. 39/B. The Appellant relies on document dated

20112/2018, marked "A4", to prove that both assessment numbers relate to one

and the same property. However, the said letter is not authenticated by the

Kuruwita Pradeshiya Sabhawa, the authority empowered to impose rates on

immovable property. "A5" is a document dated 1511 0120 18, prepared after the

institution of this action, purports to refer to assessment rates impost for the period

from 1996-2005, by the Kuruwita Pradeshiya Sabhawa which clearly relates to a

period subsequent to the declaration of the area as a development area. Therefore

as noted above, the documents sought to be admitted as additional evidence

marked "A2"-"A5", are irrelevant and! or unverified documents and therefore,

cannot be admitted or relied upon as evidence in favor of the Appellant and

accordingly, the application to admit new evidence is refused.

Section 28 (A) (I) of the Urban Development Authority Law as amended

by Act No. 44 of 1982, provides for the procedure to be followed in respect of

Page 4 of7

development activities commenced contrary to the terms and conditions of a

permit;

(a) to cease such development activity forthwith; or

(b) to restore the land on which such development activity is being executed or

has been executed, to its original condition; or

( c) to secure compliance with the permit under the authority of which that

development activity is carried out or engaged in, or with any term or

condition of such permit, and for the purposes of compliance with the

requirements aforesaid,

(i) to discontinue the use of any or building; or

(ii) to demolish or alter any building or work.

Accordingly, Section 28A (1) has laid down the procedure to be followed

where any development activity commenced, continued, resumed or completed

without a permit or contrary to any term or condition set out in a permit issued in

respect of such development activity.

The position of the Appellant is that the purported building was in existence

for at least 30 years prior to the declaration made in the Gazette Notification relied

upon by the Respondent.

In the Magistrates Court, the Appellant took up the position that the

disputed land was leased out to the Appellant's husband by the Railways

Department and that a house was constructed in the said land to which a certificate

Page 5 of 7

,

of conformity (marked "El5") was issued by the Kuruvita Pradashiya Sabawa. The

Appellant has also attached payment receipts on the Lease Agreement for 20 II

and 2012 marked "El6", and the electricity and water bill payment receipts marked

"El7"- "El9". The said documents are clearly not relevant to the premises in issue

and the learned Magistrate rightly refused to act on it. The Appellant re-agitated

the same issues before the Provincial High Court, However, failed to tender any

admissible evidence to substantiate her position that the relevant premises was in

existence prior to the area being declared as an urban development area.

In the case of Urban Development Authority Vs. H. W. Kulasiri (CA.

Revision Application No. 222612002) decided on 2111112003, Gamini

Amaratunga J. held that,

"Where an application under section 28A (3) of the UDA Law has been made the

relevant question is whether the structure in question has been erected upon a

valid permit. The existence of a permit is the only valid answer to the application

under section 28A (3). The burden of showing that the construction had been done

on a valid permit is on the person noticed. This burden is not discharged by

producing an approved building plan. It is the permit that contains the terms and

conditions relating to the construction. "

The Kuruwita Pradeshiya Sabha area was declared as an urban

development area under Gazette Extraordinary No. 821 123, dated 02106/1994 and

1629/1 6, dated 26/11 /2009. The document marked "eoX1", dated 25/1012012,

Page 6 of 7

(Vide page 113 of the brief) confirms that no permit has been issued by the

Pradeshiya Sabha to the Appellant relating to the construction to be demolished.

The document marked "o 1" tendered to the Magistrates Court clearly indicates

. that the premises to be demolished was constructed in the year 2000, which was

subsequent to the area been declared as a development area. (Vide page I 07 of the

brief). The Appellant has failed to provide an approved building plan or a

certificate of conformity in support, to resist the application filed under Section

28A (3) of the Act and therefore, has failed to offer any explanation as to her

claim of non-applicability of the said section.

In all the above circumstances, the Orders delivered by both Courts are

affirmed and the revision application is dismissed.

Application dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 15,0001-.

Dr. Ruwan Fernando, J.

I agree.
