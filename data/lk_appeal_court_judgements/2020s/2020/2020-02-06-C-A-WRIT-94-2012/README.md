Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner employer filed this application naming the

Commissioner General of Labour and the employee as

respondents, seeking (a) to quash by way of certiorari the

decision of the Commissioner General of Labour contained in

P10 whereby the petitioner was ordered to pay gratuity to the

employee, and (b) to prohibit the Commissioner General of

Labour by way of a writ of prohibition from implementing the

decision.

The employee had served as joint Managing Director of the

petitioner company. By P2 dated 20.01.2011 he complained to

the Commissioner General of Labour that he had given

resignation from employment on 08.11.2010, which was

accepted by the petitioner, but his statutory dues including

gratuity were not paid.

3

At the inquiry into this matter by the Commissioner General of

Labour, the petitioner sought refuge under section 13 of the

Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983, as amended, not to pay

gratuity to the employee.

Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act reads as follows:

Any workman, to whom a gratuity is payable under Part II

of this Act and, whose services have been terminated for

reasons of fraud, misappropriation of funds of the

employer, willful damage to property of the employer, or

causing the loss of goods, articles or property of the

employer, shall forfeit such gratuity to the extent of the

damage or loss caused by him.

After an inquiry, the Commissioner General of Labour came to

the decision in P10 on the basis that there had been no

termination of services in terms of section 13 of the Payment of

Gratuity Act for the employer to exercise the right of forfeiture.

According to the Commissioner General of Labour, there had

only been a resignation tendered by the employee by R1 dated

08.11.2010 (annexed to P7), which was accepted by the

petitioner by R3 and R4 (annexed to P7) on the same date.

I might straightaway add that there is no express acceptance of

the resignation by the employer, although one may argue that

the contents of R3 and R4 suggest acceptance.

In my view, in the facts and circumstances of this case, the

finding of the Commissioner General of Labour is unsustainable.

Let me explain.

4

It is the position of the petitioner that on or about 01.11.2010

the petitioner commenced investigations into several

irregularities and frauds committed against the petitioner

company and, towards facilitating the investigations, on

07.11.2010 the employee was asked not to report to the factory

but to the Head Office in Colombo with immediate effect. The

employee then purported to resign from employment with effect

from 07.11.2010 by letter dated 08.11.2010.

As seen from the inquiry notes marked R1 and tendered with the

statement of objections of the Commissioner General of Labour,

the employee admitted before the Commissioner General of

Labour that he was asked on 07.11.2010 to report for duty to

the Head Office, but he declined.

Whilst the inquiry was pending before the Commissioner

General of Labour, a charge sheet had been served on the

employee marked R11 dated 25.03.2011 (annexed to P7) seeking

explanation in respect of losses caused to the petitioner

company. This was replied by the employee by R13 dated

23.04.2011 (annexed to P7).

It is clear by R1 that the employee had obtained legal assistance

at the inquiry before the Commissioner General of Labour. Then

there is no doubt that the R13 reply has been written by the

employee with legal advice.

In this reply, the employee admits the petitioner company has

suffered losses, but says that he cannot take responsibility for

the same. It appears his position is that it is a shared

responsibility, not his sole responsibility. The disciplinary

5

matters raised with him by the employer on 07.11.2010 are,

according to him, unsubstantiated and the way he was treated

thereafter disgraceful. According to the employee, this caused

him to tender his resignation.

Let me quote the following portion of the said reply marked R13

to understand the background to this dispute. This letter is

addressed to the Chairman of the petitioner company.

Sarath Ganegoda [Group Finance Director] called me

around 15th October 2010, and informed me that from 18th

October 2010, physical stock taking of the inventory would

be carried out by M/s SJMS Associates and to make

arrangement accordingly. I requested time until 1st

November 21 to make such arrangements and physical

stock taking was commenced on 1st November 2010. During

the period of 18th October 2010 to 1st November 21 the

arrangements for same was done by the undersigned with

the assistance of the respective managers at different

locations of the warehouses and at the same time stock

count of the finished goods too were taken. It was at this

juncture that I was informed that there were certain

discrepancies in the finished goods stock.

At the Company audit account committee meeting held on

2nd November 201, I took immediate steps to convey that

based on unofficial physical stock taking carried out, there

is a possible difference in finished goods and value of such

difference could be as high a s US$ 1 Mn. On 4th November

201, the Company board meeting was held and again I

6

conveyed the same information. On 7th November 2010,

Sarath Ganegoda informed me that you wanted to see me

at his residence for discussion on the same day at 2.30 pm.

I would like to remind you of what transpired at the said

Meeting as it appears that you for reasons best known to

you seem to have conveniently forgotten the events of the

said meeting. As you are well aware and you cannot be

unaware that at this meeting you together with Sarath

Ganegoda and Sunil Dissanayake (Head of Group HR) were

present and you made various unsubstantiated malicious

and false allegation inter alia, with regards to promotion of

employees, not taking actions against those who were

found pilfering fabric, selling 2nd quality fabric without

calling tenders etc. In addition, you said that the Board is

totally unhappy about my performance and the new CEO

would be appointed so. You further directed that I report to

Colombo office from the following day (8th November 2010)

for which I disagreed with. As you will recall, I asked you

whether all these allegations were leveled against me with

the expectation of me to tender my resignation and you

replied in the affirmative. As such, I justifiably presumed

that the various false allegations were merely leveled

against me as an act of coercion to tender my resignation.

The employee concludes R13 in the following manner.

I further state that the manner in which you conducted

yourself at the meeting of 7th November 2010 as morefully

set out above amounts to constructive termination of my

services by you and in such circumstances, contractual

7

notice is not possible and thus question of payment in lieu

of notice does not arise. (emphasis added)

There is no dispute that in the eyes of the law, constructive

termination of employment is a legally accepted way of

terminating employment.

This is not a new phenomenon. In the instant case, constructive

termination of employment, according to the employee himself,

preceded resignation. In the Supreme Court case of Walker and

Sons & Company Ltd. v. Gurusinghe [2008] 1 Sri LR 37, this

happened vice versa in that constructive termination of

employment followed resignation. In the Walker and Sons case,

the employee was promoted with additional duties. Thereafter,

the employee gave Notice of Resignation on the ground that he

was unable to accede to the new terms due to a lack of

infrastructure facilities to achieve targets given by the employer.

Pending formal acceptance of resignation, the employee was

demoted to his earlier position and called to give explanation for

his non-participation at Management Meetings etc. Thereafter,

the employee informed the employer in writing that the latter

had terminated his services constructively and instituted

proceedings in the Labour Tribunal seeking relief for the

unjustified constructive termination of employment. The

question to be decided was whether the employee had resigned

from employment or whether his services had been

constructively terminated by the employer. This question was

significant to clothe the Labour Tribunal with jurisdiction to

grant relief to the employee, in that, if it was the former, the

employee was not entitled to relief as, in terms of section

8

31B(1)(a) of the Industrial Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950, as

amended, there shall be a termination of services by the

employer to grant relief. The Labour Tribunal, the High Court

and the Supreme Court held that there was constructive

termination of employment after the tendering of the Notice of

Resignation. Reliefs were accordingly granted to the employee.

I cannot accept the argument of learned Presidents Counsel for

the employee and learned State Counsel for the Commissioner

General of Labour that to put in motion section 13 of the

Payment of Gratuity Act, termination of employment by the

employer shall necessarily be in writing. Constructive

termination of employment by the employer is a valid

termination for this purpose.

If the services of the employee were constructively terminated by

the employer, as alleged by the employee in the instant case,

there is no necessity to thereafter tender resignation.

The letter of resignation R1 (annexed to P7) had been given on

08.11.2010. On the same day, by R3 (annexed to P7) the

petitioner informed the employee inter alia that your letter of

resignation is not consistent with the provisions of your letter of

appointment, by which you have agreed to give us 3 months

notice or 3 months salary in lieu of notice. We believe that, as you

have not given us 3 months notice you will make arrangements to

make payment of 3 months salary in lieu of notice to the

Company. This refers to clause 15 of the Letter of Appointment

marked R2 (annexed to P7), which reads as follows:

9

TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT

Your employment may be terminated by either party with

three months notice or by the payment of three months

salary in lieu of notice. Provided that the Company may

terminate your employment at any time without notice or

payment in lieu of notice on the ground of misconduct,

and/or negligence, and/or inefficiency, and/or breach of

any express or implied term of your employment.

Admittedly, this has not been complied with by the employee.

Hence there is no valid resignation for the petitioner to accept.

It is in this context the employee in R13 states that, as his

services were constructively terminated, contractual notice is not

possible and thus question of payment in lieu of notice does not

arise.

For a better understanding of the position of the petitioner in

respect of acceptance of the purported resignation, let me

reproduce the contents of the letter marked R3, issued to the

employee on the same date of his resignation, in its entirety. It

reads as follows:

We refer to your letter of resignation dated 8th November

2010, by which you have informed the Company that you

would resign with effect from 7th November 2010.

In this regard, we need to refer to the discussion the

undersigned had with you along with Messrs Sarath

Ganegoda and Sunil Dissanayake on 7th November 201, on

the high probability of the existence of

10

discrepancies/irregularities with regard to stocks and other

matters of serious concern in relation to Hayleys MGT

Knitting Mills Ltd was brought to your notice. You were

clearly told that, as Joint Managing Director of the

Company, you were directly responsible for same. You were

also required not to report to the factory until further notice,

pending investigations.

On the following day, 8th November 20, we received your

letter of resignation, in which you have informed us that

you have already resigned from 7th November 2010. Firstly

your letter of resignation is not consistent with the

provisions of your letter of appointment, by which you have

agreed to give us 3 months notice or 3 months salary in lieu

of notice. We believe that, as you have not given us 3

months notice you will make arrangements to make

payment of 3 months salary in lieu of notice to the

Company. Quite apart from the above, your resignation

from service has come in at a time when the Management

had initiated an interim audit in order to reconcile the

financial statements and stocks and receivables.

Depending on the findings of this investigation, if not for

your resignation, the Management may have issued you a

show cause letter in respect of serious acts of misconduct,

especially in relation to loss caused, if any.

By your resignation, however, you have pre-empted the

Management from proceeding with such a course of action.

Although it is your prerogative to resign from service and

you have already done so, from the point of view of

11

Management it is important to ascertain the factual

situation in relation to the Company which will only be

revealed after a thorough investigation.

In the circumstances, we write to inform you that,

notwithstanding the fact that you have resigned from

service, we would expect you to respond to matters relating

to the Company during your tenure of office, whenever

required during the investigations. It would be imperative to

do so especially to ascertain your entitlement for gratuity.

We wish to place on record that, in terms of section 13 of

the Gratuity Act, forfeiture of gratuity is possible in certain

circumstances. Therefore, we would expect you to be

available for inquiry, at any time of the investigation

processes.

Quite apart from the above, we would also reserve the right

to pursue any action against you in terms of law, if

necessary.

The same was communicated by the petitioner to the

Commissioner General of Labour by R9 dated 30.11.2010

(annexed to P7). This was prior to the employees complaint to

the Commissioner General of Labour by P2 of non-payment of

gratuity.

As seen from R14-R18 (annexed to P7), being dissatisfied with

the show cause explanation given by the employee by R13, the

petitioner held a domestic inquiry into this matter. However, the

employee refused to participate in the inquiry. It is significant

that this domestic inquiry was held whilst the inquiry before the

12

Commissioner General of Labour had been pending. After the

domestic inquiry, rightly or wrongly, the petitioner was informed

by letter dated 23.12.2011 annexed to P8 that your termination

is inter alia in the background where you were guilty of fraud

and/or misappropriation of funds and/or causing of losses to the

Company, in sums of over Rs.349,500,000/-. In these

circumstances the gratuity to which you otherwise may have been

entitled, is forfeited in terms of section 13 of the Payment of

Gratuity Act. This was informed by P8 dated 27.12.2011 to the

Commissioner General of Labour as well.

Learned State Counsel appearing for the Commissioner General

of Labour concedes that in terms of section 31B(1)(c) of the

Industrial Disputes Act, No. 43 of 1950, as amended, the

jurisdiction to inquire into the question whether the forfeiture of

a gratuity in terms of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No.12 of 1983,

has been correctly made vests with the Labour Tribunal and not

with the Commissioner General of Labour.

Once the employee accepts that his services were terminated by

the employer, and the employer states that it was done in the

circumstances contemplated in section 13 of the Payment of

Gratuity Act and proceeds to forfeit gratuity to the extent of the

damage or loss alleged to have been caused by the employee, the

Commissioner General of Labour lacks jurisdiction to further

look into the matter. The remedy of the employee, in such

circumstances, lies with the Labour Tribunal and not with the

Commissioner General of Labour.

13

In the result, I hold that the decision of the Commissioner

General of Labour contained in P10 is a nullity, as it has been

made without jurisdiction.

For the aforesaid reasons, I set aside the impugned decision of

the Commissioner General of Labour contained in P10 and grant

relief to the petitioner as prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of

the prayer to the petition. I make no order as to costs.
