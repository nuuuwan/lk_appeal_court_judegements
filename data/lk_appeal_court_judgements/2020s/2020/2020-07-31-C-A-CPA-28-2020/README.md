ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is a petition, addressed to this Court by the Petitioner invoking

its revisionary jurisdiction conferred under Article 138 of the Constitution,

by which he seeks to set aside the orders of the Provincial High Court of

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Ratnapura in Appeal No. APL 30/98

dated 30.01.2000 and also of the Magistrate's Court of Balangoda in case No.

34352 dated 08.10.1998.

It is stated that the Petitioner was charged before the Magistrate's

Court of Balangoda under Section 345 of the Penal Code as amended by Act

No. 22 of 1995. The alleged victim is a school girl of 14 years who studied

2

in Rohana College of Kaltota, where the Petitioner functioned as the school

principal.

At the conclusion of his trial, during which the Petitioner and his

witnesses also have given evidence, he was found guilty as charged by the

Magistrate's Court and was sentenced to two year term of imprisonment

suspended for a period of ten years with a fine of Rs. 1500.00, which

carried a default term of imprisonment of twelve months. He was also

ordered to pay Rs. 2000.00 to the virtual complainant as compensation

with a default term of three-months of imprisonment.

The Petitioner then preferred an appeal to the Provincial High Court

invoking its appellate jurisdiction to have his conviction and sentence set

aside in appeal No. APL 30/98. The Provincial High Court, having heard

the parties on merits by its judgment dated 30.01.2003 dismissed the

Petitioner's appeal, whilst affirming the conviction and sentence. The High

Court was not inclined to grant the Petitioner's plea for a lenient sentence.

It also rejected the Respondent's application to consider an enhanced

punishment.

Thereafter, the Petitioner sought to challenge the said judgment of

the Provincial High Court, by preferring an appeal to this Court, registered

under appeal No. CA PHC 85/2003. This Court, dismissed his appeal on

07.10.2014, since the Petitioner was absent and unrepresented. His

application to relist, which was supported by way of a motion also refused

by this Court on 24.10.2014. However, the certified proceedings tendered

by the Petitioner indicated that this Court, by its judgment dated

07.10.2014 again dismissed the Petitioner's appeal on the basis that "this

3

Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this appeal since the High Court

Judge has exercised appellate powers vested in him." The certified copy

does not contain the relevant journal entries leading up to the delivery of

the judgment of dismissal on 07.10.2014.

Subsequent to the pronouncement of the judgment by this Court

dismissing his appeal, the Petitioner had preferred an application to the

Supreme Court in SC Spl LA 221/2014, which he describes as " ... an

application for Special Leave to Appeal notwithstanding lapse of time

against the judgment dated 30/01/2003 of the High Court of Ratnapura

and the Court of Appeal judgment dated 07/10/2914 in terms of Article

128 of the Constitution." The application to Special Leave to Appeal was

tendered to the Registry of the Supreme Court on 12.02.2015 and was

supported on 27.03.2019. Having heard the Counsel, the Supreme Court

refused grant of Special Leave on the same date.

The instant application, invoking revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court is filed by the Petitioner on 12.05.2020 and was to be supported on

27.05.2020. Since the Petitioner sought interim relief, he had served notice

of this application on the Respondent who was presented in Court on that

day. This Court, invited submissions on the parties as to the question of its

jurisdiction by posing the query whether this Court has residual

revisionary powers over this matter. In addition the Petitioner must satisfy

this Court that there exists a prima facie matter to be considered by this

Court for the issuance of formal notice on the Respondents.

On 12.06.2020, learned Counsel for the Petitioner and learned

Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents have made their

4

submissions in support of their respective positions. They have also

tendered written submissions along with the authorities they relied on, in

making submissions.

In support of the Petitioner's application, learned Counsel submitted

that this Court has revisionary jurisdiction to entertain the instant

application. She relied on the recent judgment of the Supreme Court in SC

Appeal Nos. 111,113,114/2015 decided on 27.05.2020 and also of the

judgment of this Court in Illangakoon v Officer in Charge, Police Station,

Anuradhapura (2014) 1 Sri L.R. 240.

On the merits of the Petitioner's application she contended that the

Provincial High Court as well as the Magistrate's Court, have failed to

reason out the basis on which the evidence of the Petitioner was rejected,

in their respective judgments.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General resisted the Petitioner's

application on the basis that it sought to violate the principle enshrined in

Article 127(1) of the Constitution. He further contended that the conduct of

the Petitioner is clearly indicative of his intention that to frustrate justice

by abusing the litigation process. Their submissions will be considered by

this Court as it proceeds along with the judgment making reference to

them at the appropriate stages.

The Petitioner, being aggrieved by his conviction and sentence had

preferred an appeal to the relevant Provincial High Court but was

unsuccessful. He then preferred an appeal to this Court, which had been

dismissed for want of jurisdiction. Thereafter, an application seeking

Special Leave to Appeal against the said dismissal was made. The

5

Supreme Court refused to grant Special Leave to Appeal. Now the

Petitioner invokes revisionary jurisdiction of this Court to canvass the

judgments of the Provincial High Court as well as the Magistrate's Court

in the instant application.

Learned Counsel, in her attempt to satisfy this Court of a prima facie

matter, referred to the merits of the application. She submitted that none of

the lower Courts have failed to provide any reasons in their respective

judgments as to the reasons for rejection of the Petitioner's evidence, which

had been given under oath, and also of his witnesses.

It is correct that the appeal of the Petitioner was dismissed by this

Court without considering the said grievance but on the pure technical

reason of want of jurisdiction. But the Petitioner, in challenging the said

dismissal of his appeal by this Court, in his petition to the Supreme Court,

stated that" the learned Judge of the Magistrate's Court has failed to

address and properly evaluate any of the arguments raised on behalf of the

Petitioner ... and ... learned Judge of the High Court too had acted purely

on conjecture in upholding the conviction." Therefore, the Petitioner

emphasised to the Supreme Court that" ... upholding the conviction on

such manner without considering the legal arguments brought by the

Defence Counsel and contradictions of the evidence given by the

Prosecution witnesses are contrary to the well-established principles

relating to the evaluation of evidence in a case based on law of evidence

"

In the instant application, by invoking revisionary jurisdiction under

Article 138, the Petitioner had raised the identical issue once again before

6

this Court, despite the fact that he had already invoked the jurisdiction of

the Supreme Court by filing an application seeking special leave to appeal.

The Supreme Court, in refusing to grant special leave to appeal, has

had the opportunity of hearing the Petitioner in support of his application,

who adverted the said contention before their Lordships in seeking special

leave to appeal since that had been the main ground of his challenge to the

validity of the judgments of lower Courts. When Their Lordships have

decided to refuse special leave to appeal, then that issue was finally

decided by the Court of final appeal, the Supreme Court.

In Bandaranaike v Attorney General (1982) 2 Sri L.R. 786, the Supreme

Court described the scope of its jurisdiction as follows;

"Articles 118 to 136 in Chap. XVI of the Constitution deal

with the various kinds of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

and the manner of their exercise by the Supreme Court.

Article 132(1) provides that the jurisdiction of the Supreme

Court shall ordinarily be exercised at all time by not less

than three Judges of the Supreme Court sitting together on,

the Supreme Court. No distinction is made in this respect

between, constitutional jurisdiction and appellate

jurisdiction. Article 132(4) provides that "the Judgment of

the Supreme Court shall, when it is not an unanimous

decision, be the decision of the majority." In the scheme of

the chapter, it is quite clear that the provisions of Article

132(4) applies equally to the "determination" referred to in

Article 121, 122, 123, 125 and 126 and the "Judgment"

referred to in Article 127 , "opinion" referred to in Article

7

129(1) and "determination" under 129(2) and again to the

"determination" under Article 130, all made by the Supreme

Court in the exercise of its several jurisdiction. The

petitioner tried to draw a distinction between

"determination" and "judgment" and submitted that article

132(4) does not apply to the "determination" when it

exercises original jurisdiction and pronounces "judgment"

when it exercises appellate jurisdiction. That this distinction

is untenable is demonstrated by Article 130 which provides

that the Supreme Court shall have the power to hear and

determine and make such orders as provided by law on any

appeal from an order or judgment of the Court of Appeal in

the case of an election petition. The descriptions

'determination " 'judgment', 'opinion', , decision',

conclusion' are different labels for the same concept."

Having laid the scope of its multiple jurisdiction as per the Articles

of the Constitution, the Supreme Court, in its judgment of Fernandopulle v

De Silva & Others (1996) 1 Sri L.R. 70, cited S. C. Application No. 20/83S-

decided on 21.07.1983., in stating the effect of its pronouncements. Their

Lordships have quoted Samarakoon, CJ. Where His Lordship had stated

thus;

" ... the fact that the use of the phrase "shall finally dispose

of' in Article 126 (5), in dealing with the exercise of the

court's powers in relation to fundamental rights and

language rights petitions, and the phrase "final and

8

conclusive" in Article 127 in dealing with the Court's

appel/ate jurisdiction, signified that once a matter was

decided by the Supreme Court, the thing is over. There is

nothing more that can be done. As far as the matters which

are the subject of the decision are concerned, it is al/ over.

There is an end to such litigation - as needs must be with all

litigation. Public policy requires that there must be an end to

litigation, for the sake of certainty and the maintenance of

law and order, in the pacific settlement of disputes between

the citizen and the State or between other persons; for the

sake of preventing the vexation of persons by those who can

afford to indulge in litigation; and for the conservation of the

resources of the State. Interest rei publicaeut sit finis

litium. "

In addition to bringing a litigation to its finality, the Supreme Court,

In determining a matter under its appellate jurisdiction, also made the

dispute res judicata among the parties.

In view of the foregoing, it is clear that the instant application of the

Petitioner clearly satisfies the two tests that are applicable in determining

whether a particular matter has become res judicata among the parties as

identified in the case of Rev Moragolle SlImangala v Rev Kiribamllne

Piyadassi 56 NLR 322, where it has been held;

"Two important tests must be applied whenever a plea of res

judicata is raised (1) whether the judicial decision in the

earlier litigation was, or at least involved, a determination of

the same question as that sought to be controverted in the

9

later litigation in which the estoppel was raised, and if so (2)

whether the parties to the later litigation were the parties or

the privies of the parties to the earlier decision. "

As noted above, the Supreme Court had already decided the

identical issue relied upon by the Petitioner in the instant application for

determination by this Court and he was privy to the earlier decision. Not

only the Petitioner, even his Counsel was aware as to the outcome, even

though she sought to convince this Court that it has jurisdiction to consider

the identical issue.

In Potman v Inspector of Police, Dodangoda 74 NLR 115

Weeramantry J referred to the judgment of Ehambaram & Another v.

Rajasuriya (1947) 34 C. L. W. 65, where Nagalingam J. held that in an

instance where the object of an application in revision was in fact to re-

argue a case already decided, the Court cannot and could not entertain

such application. This principle obviously applies to the same Court which

had decided the earlier identical matter. In this particular instance, it was

the Supreme Court that had decided the identical issue in the earlier

determination and that determination is obviously a binding authority on

this Court.

The reliance placed by the Petitioner on the recent pronouncement

by the Supreme Court, in interpreting Section 9 of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 would not help him since

the issue here is this is not a revision application over the Provincial High

Court decision exercising its appellate powers conferred by the said

10

section, but a revision application agitating the identical issue that had

been finally decided by the highest Court in the judicial hierarchy.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner placed heavy reliance on the

judgment of Illangakoon v Officer in Charge, Police Station,

Anuradhapura (supra), in support of her submission and claimed that in

this instance too, no Court had considered the merits of the Petitioner's

complaint on the rejection of his evidence.

It is correct that this Court decided to consider the merits of an

appeal, when the petitioner in that particular revision application had

initially appealed against his conviction before he was sentenced by the

Magistrate's Court. The appeal was dismissed by the Provincial High

Court since it was preferred before the sentence was passed. His revision

application before the same Court too was dismissed due to delay of four

years. Then the said petitioner moved in revision of the said order of

dismissal before this Court. That application for revision before this Court

was also dismissed upon acceptance of the reasoning of the Provincial

High Court. Then he sought special leave against the said dismissal and

that too was refused by the Supreme Court.

Chirasiri J considered the 2nd revision application filed by the said

petitioner against the order of the Provincial High Court, on the basis that

" ... all those decisions had been made on a pure question of law, therefore, the fact

remains that no Court has considered the meri ts of his revision application ... ".

The factual position adverted to above in Illangakoon v Officer in

Charge, Police Station, Anuradhapura (supra) is clearly distinguishable

from factual position of the instant application. Unlike the situation in the

11

said precedence, in this instance of course, his appeal against the

conviction and sentence was considered on its merits by the Provincial

High Court. His appeal against the said dismissal was dismissed by this

Court initially for non-prosecution, and after allowing are-listing

application, it was re dismissed on application of law as it stood at that

point of time, which the Petitioner attributes to "wrong legal advice".

The Petitioner then sought special leave to appeal before the

Supreme Court, challenging the said dismissal on merits, as indicative

from the portions of his petition that had been reproduced above. The

judgement of the Supreme Court has no indication that the special leave to

appeal had been refused on a mere technicality, but it did indicate that the

parties were heard and special leave to appeal was refused, on its merits.

Hence, the matter is clearly res judicata among parties. In view of the

above, the contention of the Petitioner that none of the Courts considered

merits of the Petitioner's complaint is a clearly without a valid basis and

ought to be rejected.

In the course of his submissions, learned Deputy Solicitor General

termed the course of action adopted by the Petitioner in filing invoking the

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court as a clear instance of abuse of process.

He invited this Court to consider enhancement of the quantum awarded

by the Magistrate's Court to the virtual complainant in 1997, as she had

been deprived of her entitlement to a speedy justice, by adopting delaying

tactic by the Petitioner.

12

It is pertinent to note that in the English case of Attorney General v

John Barker[2000] EWHC 453, the Lord Chief Justice sought to describe a

"vexatious" proceedings. His Lordship observed that;

"The hallmark of a vexatious proceeding is in my judgment

that it has little or no basis in law (or at least no discernible

basis); that whatever the intention of the proceedings may be,

its effect is to subject the defendant to inconvenience,

harassment and expenses out of all proportion to any gain

likely to accrue to the claimant; and that it involves an abuse

of the process of the Court, meaning by that use of the Court

process for a purpose or in a way which is significantly

different from the ordinary and proper use of the Court

process. "

In Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police & Others

[1981] UKHL 13, Lord Diplock, referring to an instance where, despite a

final determination by a competent Court was made in an earlier

proceeding, if a litigant initiates another process of litigation and thereby

indirectly challenged the validity of the already made determination,

stated thus;

"Abuse of process which the instant case exemplifies is the

initiation of proceedings in a Court of Justice for the purpose

of mounting a collateral attack upon a final decision against

the intending plaintiff which has been made by another

Court of competent jurisdiction in previous proceedings in

which the intending plaintiff had a full opportunity of

contesting the decision in the Court by which it was made."

13

The instant application too is qualified to be termed as an attempt

by the Petitioner to challenge the determination of a superior Court, by

initiating a litigation in a subordinate Court since it is obvious that he was

prompted by an ulterior motive to further delay the course of justice.

This Court notes that the repeated exercise by the Petitioner

invoking appellate jurisdiction of each appellate Court until he had

exercised his right of appeal to the Supreme Court could not be faulted,

although he had sought relief from the Court of Appeal after the

Provincial High Court dismissed his appeal, as the law stood at that point

of time.

The process of criminal justice, that was initiated with the

complaint of sexual abuse in March 1997 by the virtual complainant,

finally ended when their Lordships of the Supreme Court have decided

not to grant leave to the Petitioner's application No. SC Spl LA 22/2014

on 27.09.2019.

It is noted that the Petitioner thought to re agitate the identical issue

that had been decided by the Supreme Court, by invocation of revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court after a lapse of five and half months, solely for

the purpose of delaying the conviction and sentence to take effect. This is

an instance of clear abuse of process, to which this Court must express its

unreserved condemnation.

The delay of more than five months since the judgment of the

Supreme Court was sought to be explained by the Petitioner in his

petition. He had tendered documents PI0 and PI0(a) which relates to

14

proceedings before this Court ill his earlier application No.

CA/PHC/ APN/13/2020 invoking revisionary jurisdiction of this Court.

Those proceedings indicate that the Petitioner had filed a similar

application invoking revisionary jurisdiction of this Court under that

number. It was withdrawn on 14.02.2020 by his Counsel, in his presence.

Strangely a different Counsel, on 10.03.2020, made application to this

Court and submitted that the former Counsel who appeared for the

Petitioner had withdrawn the said application without his instructions.

Strangely, the instant application is supported by the same Counsel who

acted without instructions of the Petitioner, in withdrawing his earlier

application.

What is important to note is that this Court had observed at that

stage, the Petitioner was summoned by the Magistrate's Court, in order to

pronounce the judgment of the Provincial High Court, in dismissing his

appeal. It appears that the Petitioner did not comply with the summons by

attending Court, but allegedly produced a medical certificate by admitting

himself to a hospital. The origins and the authenticity of the said medical

certificate was questioned by this Court as per the journal of 10.03.2020.

Thus, the conduct of the Petitioner is clearly indicative of his

intentions to avoid the pronouncement of the judgment of the Provincial

High Court by resorting to delaying tactics, under the camouflage of

seemingly legitimate exercise of invoking revisionary jurisdiction

repeatedly.

It is the considered view of this Court that the conduct of the

Petitioner satisfies the description of abuse of process as described by Lord

15

Dip/ock in Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police & Others

(supra) as a conduct that would "bring the administration of justice into

disrepute among right thinking people".

Therefore, in view of the forgoing, this Court refuses to issue formal

notice on the Respondents.

The petition of the Petitioner is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.

250,000.00 payable to the 2nd Respondent.
