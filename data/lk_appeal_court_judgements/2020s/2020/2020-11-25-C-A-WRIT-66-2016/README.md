The Petitioner has instituted this action inter alia seeking

i. A Writ of Certiorari quashing the purported decision marked as P16,

ii. A mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents to absorb the Petitioner to the SL-1-2006 salary scale, and

iii. A Writ of Mandamus to promote the Petitioner to the next grade namely Deputy

Director.

The Petitioner says that he has joined the Department of Information as a Publicity Assistant

and gradually went up of the ladder due to his dedicated service. In the year 2001 the

Petitioner was promoted to Assistant Director (Non SLAS) post as per document marked P2.

The said promotion was approved by the cabinet and the said cabinet decision has been submitted by the Respondents marked as 2R3a.

The internal promotion scheme of the Department of Government Information is recognized

as a closed service and there is a separate criteria followed by the said department. In terms of the document marked as P3, the new salary scales were introduced to the public service

and the Ministry of Finance and Planning has re-structured the Departmental Services of

Government Information Department in the Year 2010.

The Petitioner states that as per P4, the Petitioner's designation is placed under item number

7 namely Assistant Director (Departmental). Thereafter when salary scales were determined the National Salaries and Cadre Commission has recommended SL-1-2006 salary scale to the

said Assistant Director Position. (Vide Documents marked as PS)

The Petitioner states however that the Director General of Government Information

Department, due to political discrimination had not taken steps to place the Petitioner in the

aforesaid salary scale whereas the Petitioner who held the post of Assistant Director was

remained in the salary scale of MN-7-2006 which was appropriate to a lower rank. In other

word the Petitioner who has been holding an executive position since year 2001 has been

given a salary of non-executive officers namely Photographers and technical officers.

The Petitioner states that according to the document marked as P7 the Ministry of Finance

has clearly approved SL-1-2006 salary scale to the Petitioner's position namely Assistant

Director. The Petitioner states however that the Respondents did not take any steps to pay

the salary which the Petitioner is entitled for without any valid reason whatsoever.

The Petitioner states that the Petitioner was not placed in the above salary scale and the

Petitioner was compelled to make a complaint to the Public Service Commission (vide

document marked as P9). In the meantime the Petitioner was appointed as the acting Deputy

Director in terms of letter marked P8 according to which the Petitioner's salary scale must be

SL-1-11. At the same time the Director General of the Department wrote to the Secretary to

the Ministry and Public Service Commission to place the Petitioner to the appropriate salary

scale namely SL -1-2006.

The Petitioner states that the Secretary to the Ministry of Mass Media also directed the

National Salary and Cadre Commission to rectify the salary anomaly of the Petitioner (vide

P14). However the Respondents acting very unreasonable and illegal manner did not take

steps to rectify the said error despite the fact that the Petitioner has been covering all the

duties of the posts of Assistant Director as well as Deputy Director. The Petitioner states that

in the meantime almost after five years of deafening silence the National Pay commission has sent the letter marked as P16 which contained the following positions.

i. A promotion to the post of Assistant Director could only be granted to a person

attached to SL 1- 2006 salary scheme.

ii. Even though the Petitioner was assigned duties of Assistant Director he was attached to MN 7- 2006 salary scheme.

5

iii. Therefore he couldn't be placed in the SL 1-2006 salary scale although the Petitioner

is holding the post of Assistant Director(vide P16)

The Petitioner states that he was promoted to the higher position and obtaining his service

as Assistant Director, he has legitimate expectation to receive the appropriate salary for his position and get entitled promotions. The Petitioner therefore states that the Petitioner who was duly promoted to the rank of Assistant Director has been granted a low salary scale which

is a prima facie unreasonable and discriminatory conduct of the Respondents.

The Petitioner further states that all the relevant authorities and persons namely Director General of the relevant Department, Secretary to the Ministry of Mass Media, Ministry of Finance and Planning, National Salaries and Cadre Commission have recognized and recommended to place the Petitioner in the eligible salary scale. On the other hand it was argued that the Purported position taken up in the impugned letter marked as P16 has no

basis or rational and it has been issued with mala fide.

The Petitioner stated that, for an instance the said letter says that the Petitioner's promotion

is not a general but a personalized promotion whereas the Respondent's own document marked as 2R3, 2R3a clearly shows, the Petitioner was promoted to full fill a vacancy

considering his qualification.

The Petitioner argued that the Petitioner was placed MN-7-2006 a salary scale at the time of

said promotion, however the document marked as P7 by the Petitioner and the document marked as 2R13 by Respondents clearly shows in the year 2012, the salary scales of the Department have been restructured according to which the Petitioner's salary scale should

be SL-1-2006. Therefore it is the position of the Petitioner that the Respondents have no sustainable and rational defence and thus they couldn't even meet the arguments ofthis case.

In the aforesaid Circumstances, the Petitioner preferred this writ application seeking to quash

the said purported decision contained in document marked as P16.

The Respondents filed their objection stating that even though the cabinet has given approval to appoint the Petitioner as Assistant Director in terms of the Cabinet Decision marked as

2R3a, Petitioner's salary scale had not been specifically mentioned. Therefore the 2nd

Respondent's position is that without specific reference to salary scale in the cabinet decision

they cannot place the Petitioner in SL-1-2006 salary scale.

Furthermore the Respondents took up another purported position that the said promotion of the Petitioner was not a general promotion. It is a personalized promotion thus he is not

entitled for general benefits. The Respondents further submitted to Court that the Petitioner's appointment was merely a political appointment hence he cannot be absorbed to the SL-1-2006 salary scale.

Subsequent to a thorough analysis of the facts of the case, it is my observation that the Petitioner has failed to produce his letter of appointment of the perused of Court (paragraph 6 of the statement of Objections)

It is also pertinent to note that as per the post of Assistant information Officer, by a Cabinet Paper dated 28.02.2001; (paragraph 7a) ,the said Cabinet Decision did not specify the Salary of the said post although it was personal to the Petitioner. [Paragraph 7(a) + 7(b)]

I further note that according to the Scheme of Recruitment the Salary Scale of the Assistant Director is TB-3-8-2 and payment has been made accordingly and the Petitioner has accepted payment. [Paragraphs 8(d)(e)+ (f)].

Further, by letter marked 4R3 the Department of Management Services has placed the

Petitioner in the Scale T-3-10-1 with effect from 10.06.2004. [Paragraph 8(g)] . New Salary

Scales were introduced by Circular 6/2006; and by document marked 4R4(b) the National

Salaries and Cadre Commission the Salary Scale MN7-2006 had been allocated to the previous salary scale ofTB 3-10-1 where the Petitioner had been placed. (Paragraph 10C)

It is also pertinent to note that In terms of Public Administration Circular NO.6 of 2006 for those who were in Public Service on 01.01.2006 were paid according to their Salary Scales as at 31.12.2005. [Paragraph 10(e)]

It is also my observation that for Salary Scale TB-3-10-1 the equivalent Salary Scale was MN7 step 3 of the PA Circular No: 6/2006. Accordingly the Petitioner had been given the Salary Scale of MN7-2006- Step3 (para. 10(h).

Further, the Scheme of Recruitment which included the relevant Salary Scale for these posts

have been approved by the Public Services Commission. (Vide paragraph 13(d) of the Statement of Objections of the 3-26th Respondents). Therefore, in the circumstances in view of Article 61A of the Constitution, no Writ of Certiorari as prayed for by the Petitioner will lie.

There is also no statutory duty to absorb the Petitioner to the SL-1-2006 Salary Scale and

accordingly no Writ of Mandamus will lie as prayed for by the Petitioner. It is important to note that the principle is well established in law by the Judgment is Weligama Multipurpose

Co-operative Society Vs. Chandradasa Daluwatte 1984 1SLR 195.

In the aforesaid circumstances Petitioner's application is dismissed, with cost.
