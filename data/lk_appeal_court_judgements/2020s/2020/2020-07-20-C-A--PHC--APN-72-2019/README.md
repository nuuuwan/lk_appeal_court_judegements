ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an application by the Accused-Petitioner (hereinafter referred

to as the Petitioner) by which he invokes the revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court in seeking to set aside the orders made by the High Court of

Gampaha onll. 01.2018 and 08.05.2019 respectively. The High Court made

order on 11.01.2018, by which the Petitioner was remanded upon

cancelling the existing bail order in case No. HC 29/16. The order made

by the same Court on 08.05.2019 is an order by which it had refused his

subsequent application for bail.

The case No. 29/16, pending before the High Court of Gampaha

against the Petitioner, is where he was named as the 1 s'accused in

committing murder of one Withana Weerasinghe Arachcilage Saman

Jayaweera on 07.05.2008.

2

In stating the circumstances under which the said impugned orders

were made, the Petitioner states that he was arrested in connection with

the said murder in October 2008 and after about two years since his arrest,

was enlarged on bail on 13.05.2010 upon the order made by the High

Court of Gampaha in application No. HCBA 266/2009.

On 09.04.2013 he was arrested by officers attached to Police

Narcotics Bureau and was produced before the Magistrate's Court of

Attanagalla in case No. B 693/13, by introducing Heroin. He was enlarged

on bail by the High Court in application No. HCBA 219/13 by its order

dated 05.05.2014. He was indicted for possession of Heroin in case No.

110/14 before the same Court.

The Petitioner was arrested by the PNB officers again in May 2016,

after introducing Heroin, as he claims. After his arrest, he was produced

before the Magistrate's Court of Attanagalla in case No. B 693/2013. He

was enlarged on bail by the High Court in application No. HCBA 137/16

by order dated 24.10.2016, "even before the receipt of Government Analyst

report". He was indicted before High Court of Gampaha in case Nos.

109/ /14 and 110/14 in respect of the said detection where he is accused of

being in possession of Heroin and also a firearm.

Thereafter, the Petitioner was arrested by the PNB officers for the

third time with three others on 14.10.2017 and produced before the

Magistrate's Court of Attanagalla in case No. 2598/17. The Petitioner was

enlarged on bail by the High Court of Gampaha in application No. HCBA

67/2019 on 01.04.2019.

In paragraph 8 of his petition addressed to this Court, the Petitioner

states that;

" ... he could not appear before High Court of Gampaha for HC

29;2016 on 25.10.2017 as he was in remand custody under B

2598/17 and was not produced to Court by the Prison officers on

that day, and he was produced to High Court for HC 29/16 on

11.01.2018 by the Prison officers on that day the learned High

Court Judge cancelled his bail, without hearing him personally or

his lawyer, violating section 14(1) of the Bail Act, citing the reason

that he might involve in other crimes if he was released on bail."

He then identifies several "exceptional" grounds in paragraph 12 of

his petition and invited this Court to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction in

consideration of them. These grounds include the failure of the High Court

to note that there was no condition to re-offend, no evidence of him posing

a flight risk, he has right to bail and no previous convictions, the Court had

acted in violation of its own previous order, results in indefinite

incarceration, is violative of presumption of innocence and of his rights

under ICCPR Act No. 56 of 2007 and set up a wrong judicial precedent.

At the hearing of this application, learned Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that the High Court made order cancelling his existing bail order

without giving him a hearing. Therefore, learned Counsel contends that the

said Court had come to the conclusion without any evidence or

information that there is a greater possibility that he might evade

appearing before Court. He relied on the judgment of this Court in CA

(PHC) Application No. 58/2013 - decided on 03.09.2013 where it was

4

reiterated that" ... the Court is entitled to cancel a bail bond (after hearing the

accused) for violating the bail conditions ... " and in this instance there was no

opportunity afforded to the Petitioner to offer his explanation. He also

referred to the original order by which the Petitioner was enlarged on bail,

which had no condition imposed on the Petitioner not to re-offend. Thus, it

was contended that the impugned order of cancellation of bail was made

contrary to law and the subsequent order of the said Court in refusing bail,

too is dependent on the legality of the order of cancellation.

Learned State Counsel, in her objections listed out following as

pending cases against the Petitioner;

a. HC 140/19 of High Court Gampaha for possession and trafficking

of 20 grams of Heroin on 27.05.2016,

b. HC 183/19 of High Court Gampaha for possession and trafficking

of 6 grams of Heroin on 16.10.2017,

c. HC 110/14 of High Court Gampaha for possession of an automatic

weapon and live cartridges on 09.04.2013,

d. HC 109/14 of High Court Gampaha for possession and trafficking

of 11.25 grams of Heroin on 09.04.2013.

In resisting the Petitioner's application for revision, learned State

Counsel submitted that there are no exceptional circumstances upon which

this Court could grant him relief.

5

Since the indictment in case No. 29/16 alleged that he committed murder,

an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code, the applicable

law in relation to bail is found in Bail Act No. 30 Of 1997.

The impugned order dated 16.01.2018 was made by the High Court,

when the Petitioner was represented by his Counsel, having noted that it

could not proceed to commence the trial since the Petitioner was rearrested

and remanded on an allegation of committing another offence. Thereupon,

it proceeded to cancel his bail on the basis that the Petitioner would

reoffend and also would pose high flight risk.

The Petitioner claims that there was no evidence before the High

Court of him posing a flight risk. But the proceedings of HC 29/16 on

11.01.2018 indicate that he was arrested on a warrant due to his

unexplained absence in Court and his sureties have withdrawn from their

suretyships. Learned High Court Judge who presided over on 11.01.2018 is

the same Judge who made the 1st impugned order on 16.01.2018 after a

lapse of mere 5 days since his previous order. Clearly the Petitioner's claim

there was no evidence as to the flight risk, is clearly a statement which did

not reflect the actual position.

The 2nd impugned order dated 08.05.2019 is an order by which the

High Court had refused the Petitioner's application to enlarge him on bail

applying similar considerations as it did on 11.01.2018. This particular

order is a common order made in relation to three bail applications in

reference to the three High Court Case Nos. 29/2016, 109/2014 and

110/2014. The Court considered that case No. 29/2016, the Petitioner was

accused of committing murder, while case No. 110/14 was in relation to

6

possession of Heroin and also of an automatic weapon with live

ammunition.

The alleged murder was committed in 2008 whereas the detection in

relation to possession of Heroin and firearm was made in 2013, whilst he

was on bail. When the Court made the said 2nd order, the Petitioner was

accused of yet another instance of possessing Heroin, where he was

indicted in Case No. HC 67/19.

It was urged on behalf of the Petitioner that he was remanded for a

long period of time and was enlarged on bail in relation to one of his

already pending cases.

The main thrust of the Petitioner's contention on the order dated

16.01.2018 was the High Court failed to offer an opportunity to show cause

as to why his bail bond should not be cancelled.

Upon perusal of the said impugned order, it is evident that the

Petitioner was not present on a trial date and his Counsel informed Court

that he was remanded in relation to a subsequent allegation. It would have

been clearer if the High Court, in cancelling the existing bail order, referred

at least to the gist of the submissions of the Counsel for the Petitioner,

before making the said order. However, the short Court order contains

material that were placed by the Petitioner and it's reasons for cancelling

the existing bail order.

When the High Court made the 1st impugned order on 11.01.2016,

the Case No. 29/16 against the Petitioner was fixed for trial. On that day

7

his trial could not commence as scheduled due to absence of the Petitioner,

who was on remand in relation to another allegation.

In this situation, the applicable provisions are contained in Section

263(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as amended by

Act No. 14 of 2005. Applicable parts of the said sub section are to the effect

that whenever it becomes necessary or advisable to postpone the

commencement of trial, the Court may remand the accused if in custody or

may commit him to custody or take bail in his own recognizance.

In this instance, the Petitioner's alleged conduct resulted in the

postponement of the commencement of his trial before the High Court and

he was accused committing a similar offence on 27.05.2016, whilst being on

bail for several such cases that are pending before the same Court. It is his

contention that Heroin was introduced on him by overzealous officers of

the PNB due to their personal animosity towards him. However, this Court

nor the High Court at this stage cannot decide veracity of the Petitioner's

claim for it is the trial Court that had been empowered to decide that

question of fact, only upon hearing evidence.

When the Counsel for the Petitioner informed Court that he was

accused of similar offence, it is reasonable for that Court to infer that the

Petitioner poses a greater flight risk with several other cases are pending,

in addition to the one he already has, some which carried sentence of death

or life imprisonment, if found guilty.

The Petitioner also stated in his petition that" .. . learned High Court

Judge failed to observe that the Petitioner appeared in Court in all the dates

8

in this Case except when he was remanded "and described the said

ground as an exceptional ground.

In stating this particular ground as exceptional, the Petitioner

qualifies himself to his declaration to "this case". There is a valid reason for

this selective assertion. This is due to the fact that in Case No. HC 29/16,

the Petitioner did not appear before the High Court on a trial date and was

produced before that Court on 11.01.2018, being arrested upon execution of

a warrant of arrest. On that day, his sureties sought to withdraw from their

suretyships and the Court made order remanding the Petitioner. This is a

clear attempt to mislead this Court by the Petitioner and in the light of the

misstatement referred to above, this Court is convinced that the Petitioner

did not come to this Court with clean hands in relation to the relief he seeks

being a discretionary remedy, his conduct is very material in determining

this application.

In respect of the 2nd impugned order, the Petitioner submitted to

Court that since he had been enlarged on bail in the case due to which his

existing bail order was cancelled, he should be enlarged on bail on other

cases as well. When three applications for bail are taken up before the

High Court for inquiry, it is not clear whether the Petitioner had addressed

the Court on two different legal regimes which are applicable to the three

applications.

In relation to the allegation of murder, it is the provisions of Bail Act

that are applicable while in relation to allegations of possession of Heroin,

it is the provisions of Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance that

are applicable.

. ,

Section 14(1) of the Bail Act empowers a Court to cancel an existing

order of bail already granted in favour of an accused, if it has reason to

believe;

(a) that such person would

(i) not appear to stand his inquiry or trial;

(ii) interfere with the witnesses or the evidence

against him or otherwise obstruct the course of

justice; or

(iii) commit an offence while on bail; or

(b) that the particular gravity of, and public reaction to, the

alleged offence may give rise to public disquiet

The High Court, in making both of its impugned orders were acting

under the clear statutory provision by which it could rescind an existing

bail order and refusing to enlarge an accused who had re offended

repeatedly and posed a high degree of flight risk In view of the above

considerations, this Court finds no illegality or irregularity in the

impugned orders made by the High Court Since the Petitioner has failed

to satisfy this Court that the grounds that were described are exceptional in

order to exercise its revisionary powers, His application is accordingly

refused,

10

In these circumstances, his petition is dismissed without costs.
