Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner is an Attorney-at-Law and a Notary Public. The

1st Respondent, the Commissioner of Revenue of the Western

Province, found systematic stamp duty forgeries on a number of

Deeds executed by the Petitioner. The modus operandi had been

affixing forged stamp duty payment receipts on the duplicate

Deeds, thereby defrauding the Registrar of Lands, the

Commissioner of Revenue and Government revenue.

The Petitioners position is these forgeries were committed

unknown to her by the clerk of the senior lawyer under whom

she is practicing, and the said clerk pleaded guilty to forgery

when proceedings were instituted against him in the

Magistrates Court.

The Petitioners senior is the Petitioner in CA/WRIT/137/2017.

The Petitioner further says this clerk similarly committed frauds

on her senior and another Attorney-at-Law (i.e. the Petitioner in

CA/WRIT/138/2017) who obtained the services of the clerk in

the course of their notarial practice.

The 1st Respondent by letter marked P6(a) dated 17.11.2015

informed the Petitioner that the stamp duty payable on Deed No.

586 executed by the Petitioner had not been credited to the

Commissioners account and requested the Petitioner to pay the

stamp duty together with a 300% penalty thereon, amounting to

a total sum of Rs. 2,156,000, within seven days.

The Petitioner immediately paid the stamp duty, but not the

penalty.

4

The Petitioner then received the letters marked P8(a) and P8(b)

both dated 23.11.2015 from the 1st Respondent, informing her

that the stamp duty payable on Deed Nos. 585 and 630

executed by the Petitioner had not been credited to the

Commissioners account. Accordingly, the Petitioner was

requested to pay the stamp duty and a 300% penalty thereon in

a sum of Rs. 168,000 within seven days.

Again, the Petitioner paid only the stamp duty; the penalty was

not paid.

The 1st Respondent then sent three notices marked P10(a),

P10(b) and P10(c) dated 08.12.2015 in respect of the three

Deeds mentioned earlier, under section 57(1)(b) of the Financial

Statute of the Western Province, No.6 of 1990, requiring the

Petitioner to pay the stamp duties in default and the stated

penalties immediately.

The Petitioner filed appeals against the said section 57(1)(b)

notices, as she is entitled to do under section 79(1) of the

Financial Statute of the Western Province.

Appeal P11(a) dated 07.01.2016 was filed against the P10(b)

notice; appeal P11(b) dated 07.01.2016 was filed against the

P10(c) notice; and appeal P11(c) dated 07.01.2016 was filed

against the P10(a) notice.

The 1st Respondent, without holding an inquiry into these

appeals, then served the section 87 notices dated 11.01.2016

marked P12(a), P12(b) and P12(c) on the Petitioner. The Section

87 notice conveyed the intention of the 1st Respondent to take

5

legal action against the Petitioner for the recovery of default

stamp duties.

The 1st Respondent by the letters marked P14(a)-P14(c) dated

25.04.2016 informed the Petitioner of his inability to grant

concessions or relief, as the matter pertains to forged documents

defrauding government revenue.

It appears this is the appeal decision of the 1st Respondent in

respect of the said appeals marked P11(a)-P11(c). This decision

was taken without an inquiry as contemplated in the Financial

Statute of the Western Province.

This is the first complaint of the Petitioner.

Let me now consider the second complaint of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner received the letter marked P21 dated 08.03.2016

from the 1st Respondent, whereby she was informed to pay an

aggregate amount of Rs. 366,000 as default stamp duties and a

300% penalty thereon, on the basis stamp duties had not been

paid on Deed Nos. 553, 573 and 574 executed by her.

The Petitioner paid the default stamp duties but not the

penalties.

The 1st Respondent sent the notice marked P15 dated

23.05.2016 under section 57(1)(b), informing the Petitioner to

pay the said amount immediately.

Against this notice, the Petitioner filed appeals P18(a), P18(b)

and P18(c) all dated 08.12.2016.

6

As no inquiry was held, the Petitioner by P19 dated 22.02.2017

requested that the 1st Respondent hold an inquiry.

The 1st Respondent by P20 dated 22.03.2017 informed the

Petitioner of his inability to grant relief and also that legal

actions had already been initiated (in the Magistrates Court) to

recover the penalties as fines.

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash the

P6(a), P7, P8(a), P8(b), P14(a), P14(b), P14(c), P20, P21 letters

and the P10(a), P10(b), P10(c), P12(a), P12(b), P12(c), P15 notices

by a writ of certiorari; to prevent the Respondents from taking

legal action to recover the said penalties by a writ of prohibition;

and to direct the 1st Respondent to consider P11(a), P11(b),

P11(c), P18(a), P18(b), P18(c), P19 as proper appeals and to hold

an inquiry into the matters reflected in the P6(a), P7, P8(a),

P8(b), P14(a), P14(b), P14(c), P20, P21 letters and the P10(a),

P10(b), P10(c), P12(a), P12(b), P12(c) notices by mandamus.

The gravamen of the submission of learned Presidents Counsel

for the Petitioner is that in violation of the rules of natural

justice, the Petitioner was not heard on her appeals marked

P11(a), P11(b), P11(c), P18(a), P18(b), P18(c) and P19, prior to

the 1st Respondent taking steps to recover the penalties by

instituting actions in the Magistrates Court.

Let me now consider this submission.

Section 57(1)(b) of the Financial Statute of the Western Province

states:

7

if he [the Commissioner] is of opinion that such instrument

is chargeable with stamp duty and is not duly stamped, he

shall, by notice in writing, require the person liable to pay

the stamp duty to pay the proper duty or the amount

required to make up the same, together with a penalty not

exceeding three times the amount of the proper duty.

This section allows the Commissioner to impose a penalty equal

to three times the stamp duty payable, in addition to the stamp

duty in default.

Hence, I hold the P10(a), P10(b), P10(c) and P15 notices sent

under section 57(1)(b) of the Financial Statutes of the Western

Province contain lawful decisions. These notices cannot be

quashed by certiorari.

Section 79(1) of the Financial Statute states any person

aggrieved by the decision made under section 57(1)(b) may

appeal against it to the 1st Respondent Commissioner within

thirty days after the service of notice.

By the appeals marked P11(a), P11(b) and P11(c) dated

07.01.2016, the Petitioner appealed against the P10(a), P10(b)

and P10(c) notices dated 08.12.2015, issued under section

57(1)(b) of the Financial Statute.

The Petitioner does not say when exactly she received these

notices. Assuming the said notices dated 08.12.2015 had been

received by the Petitioner on 09.12.2015, the appeals dated

07.01.2015 were filed within thirty days of the service of notice,

as required by section 79(1) of the Financial Statute.

8

I hold that the appeals P11(a), P11(b) and P11(c) constitute valid

appeals.

According to section 79(6) of the Financial Statute, unless there

is an adjustment, the Commissioner shall fix a time and place

for the hearing of the appeal made against a notice under

section 57(1)(b) and a proper inquiry shall be held. A detailed

procedure is laid down in section 79 running into

subparagraphs (1)-(13) regarding the conduct of such an appeal.

An aggrieved party can appeal against the decision of the

Commissioner to the Board of Review and then to the Court of

Appeal. The procedure is elaborately illustrated in chapters XXV

and XXVI of the Financial Statute.

There cannot be any dispute that no inquiry contemplated in

section 79 was held by the 1st Respondent in respect of the three

appeals marked P11(a)-P11(c).

Without hearing and deciding on the said appeals, the 1st

Respondent could not have sent the section 87 notice or

instituted proceedings in the Magistrates Court to recover the

relevant penalties.

However, the position regarding the appeals marked P18(a),

P18(b) and P18(c) dated 08.12.2016 is different. These appeals

were filed against the section 57(1)(b) notice dated 23.05.2016

marked P15. Clearly these three appeals, having been filed more

than six months after the P15 notice, are out of time. These

three appeals cannot be regarded as valid appeals. The appeal

marked P19 dated 22.02.2017 also cannot be regarded as a

valid appeal for the same reason.

9

For the aforesaid reasons I hold:

(a) Unless the appeals marked P11(a), P11(b) and P11(c)

are heard and determined, the 1st Respondent cannot

institute proceedings in the Magistrates Court to

recover the penalties as reflected in the notices marked

P10(a), P10(b) and P10(c).

The Magistrates Court proceedings instituted to

recover the said penalties are null and void. I quash

the said proceedings by way of a writ of certiorari.

(b) The 1st Respondent is directed by way of a writ of

mandamus to hold an inquiry in respect of the P11(a),

P11(b) and P11(c) appeals and make an appropriate

Order in terms of the law.

(c) The appeals marked P18(a), P18(b) and P18(c) filed

against the notice marked P15 are invalid.

The Magistrates Court proceedings instituted to

recover the penalties as reflected in the P15 notice can

continue.

The application of the Petitioner is partly allowed. Let the

parties bear their own costs.
