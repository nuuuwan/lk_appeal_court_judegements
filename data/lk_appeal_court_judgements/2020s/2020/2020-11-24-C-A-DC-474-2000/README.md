The 1st and 3,d Defendant -Appellants (hereinafter called and referred to as the "Appellants")

preferred this appeal against the judgment dated 15.08.2000 of the learned District Judge of , Kuliyapitiya in case No. P/10342. The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter called and referred to

as the 'Plaintiff) instituted this action against the Defendants to partition the land called "Lindagawawatta" described in the schedule to the Plaint. All parties agreed that the corpus sought to be partitioned is Lot 1 to 5 of Preliminary Plan No.2416 dated 22.06.1992 prepared by Court Commissioner R. B. Navaratne.

This Partition action was filed in the DC, on the 28.01.1992 and proceeded for trial. Judgment was delivered on the 14.08.1996. The 1st and 3,d Defendants, appealed against the said

Judgment and the Court of Appeal after arguments, dismissed the Plaintiff's action on the 25.01.1999. Special leave to Appeal application was filed by the Plaintiff, against the said dismissal and on the 04.06.1999, Supreme Court directed for trial de novo with the consent

of both parties.

The re-trial was started on 13.03.2000. Only the Plaintiff and the 1st Defendant had given evidence. The learned District Judge delivered the judgment on the 15.08.2000, in favor of the Plaintiff. The present Appeal was filed by the 1st and 3,d Defendants against the said

Judgment.

The corpus was admitted by all parties and therefore, there was no dispute with regard to the

identity of the corpus.

The main issue in this case is whether the aforesaid land should be partitioned by relying on the pedigree shown by the Plaintiff Respondent or the pedigree of the 1st and 3,d Defendant Appellants. The Plaintiff Respondent has discharged his burden by submitting title deeds produced and marked as P1 to P4 to prove that he is entitled to undivided 126/168 share.

The Appellants challenged the aforesaid pedigree of the Plaintiff by pleading that the original owner of the property was one Dingirala, who was governed by the Kandyan Law. He died leaving 4 children namely Kiribanda, Ungurala, Uppuhamy and Singngappu and according to the statement of claim ofthe1st and 3,d Defendants, they have referred to several title deeds and pleaded that the 1st Defendant is entitled to undivided 16/42 share and the 3,d Defendant

is entitled to undivided 5/42 share, subject to the life interest of the 1st Defendant.

The Plaintiff Respondent further states that the deeds produced and marked as 1D4 and 1D6 dated 28.04.1954, Abraham and Lewis who are children of Ungurala and Lokuhamy have transferred their rights as inherited from their parents to Punchibanda, whereas their father Lokohamy by deed produced and marked as 1D1 dated 29.12.1954 transferred undivided 1/4th of his rights to Punchibanda, Martin Singho and Themanis.

In view of the above Deed, produced and marked as 1D1, Lokuhamy was live on 29.12.1954, at least 8 months after Deeds No.1D3 and 1D6 were executed on 28.04.1954, on the ground that they inherited parental rights when their father Lokuhamy was living.

Therefore, it was argued that Abraham and Lewis cannot transfer paternal inheritance by the

said deeds, as their father was living.

The Defendant Appellants challenged the -above view by claiming that although in the

schedule to the deed NO.38160 (lD4), there are three lands which had been mentioned under No.1, 2 and 3 but under No.1 only parental inheritance was referred . Also, the Appellants claim that the schedule to the deed NO.38159 (lD6), there are five lands, that had been mentioned under five numbers 1 to 5 but under number 2 and 3 onlX maternal inheritances were transferred.

The Defendant Appellants stated that the Learned Trial Judge's view that the land in dispute called "Lidagawawatta" and the deeds marked 1Dl to lD8 do not refer Lidagawawatta and they refer some other land called Lidawatta is baseless. That conclusion is incorrect, as the schedule to the deeds marked 1D3 and 1D8 specifically says that land referred to Lidagawawatta alias Lidawatta. It shows that, both names were used for the same land.

However, it is my view that the Learned District Judge has critically and thoroughly analyzed the title deeds submitted by the Appellants and compared with the title deeds submitted on

behalf of the Plaintiff Respondent.

It was held in Thilagaratnam vs Appunathan And Others 1996 (2) SLR 66 that "although there

is a duty cast on Court to investigate title in a Partition action, the Court can do so only within the limits of pleadings, admissions, points of contest, evidence both documentary and .oraL"

"Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and finding the shares of the corpus

for them. Otherwise parties will tender their pleadings and expect the Court to do their work

and their Attorneys-at-Law's work, for them to get title to those shares in the corpus."

According to the evidence of the Plaintiff-Respondent, the initial owners of the said land were

Podinona, Punchirala, Mudalihamy, Podiappuhamy, Dingiri Banda and Ukkubanda. Each of

them was entitled to an undivided 1/8" share and all of them together owned 6/8'h share of

the entire land. The remaining 2/8'h share was owned by Lokuhamy.

It is evident that the said Podinona transferred her undivided 1/8'h share by deed No.29378

(Pl) dated 09.05.1945 to Ukkubanda. The remaining co-owners (Punchirala, Mudalihamy,

Podiappuhamy and Dingiri Banda) transferred their undivided 4/8'h share (= 1/2) to the same

Ukkubanda by deed No.27234 dated 20.01.1943 (P2) and thereby Ukkubanda became

entitled to an undivided 6/8'h share (= 3/4). Said Ukkubanda died leaving Themanis Singho,

Davith Singho, Simon Singho, Dingiri Menika and Ran Menika who have become entitled to

the said 6/8'h share (=3/4) and they by deed No.649 dated 25.05.1974 (P3) transferred the

said 6/8'h share (= 3/4) to Punchibanda who transferred the same to the Plaintiff Respondents

by deed No.3554 (P4) dated 23.10.1991.

Therefore, the Plaintiff-Respondent claims that he would be entitled to an undivided 3/4'h

share of the corpus.

According to the Plaintiff, the said Lokuhamy transferred her undivided 1/4'h share by deed

No.38826 dated 29.12.1954 (lDl) to the 1st and 2nd Defendant-Appellants and to one

Page 4 of 7

Themanis Singho. The said Themanis Singho transferred his undivided 1/12th share by deed , No.254 dated 24.06.1967 (102) to the 1" Defendant. According to the Plaintiff-Respondent,

the 1" Defendant became entitled to an undivided 2/12th or 1/6th share. 1" Defendant

thereafter by deed No.5928 (103) dated 20.10.1983 conveyed an undivided 5/42th shar~ to

the 3,d Defendant Appellant.

The Plaintiff Respondent therefore claims that, 1" Defendant-Appellant would be entitled to

an undivided 2/42 (= 1/21) of the corpus and 2nd Defendant is entitled to 1/12 and 3,d

Defendant-Appellant is entitled to 5/42.

It is my standpoint that by deed marked 101 Lokuhamy transferred her undivided 1/4 share

(according to Plaintiff's pedigree) on 29-12-1954 and there was no dispute about the date or

the validity of this deed. Lokuhamy would have been living on 29th December 1954, but the

deeds produced and marked as 104 and 106 by which Abraham and Lewis have transferred

the rights which they got from Ungurala and Lokuhamy (parents) has been written on

.28.4.1954. If Lokuhamy was living in December to sign deed marked 101, it looks like that

there is no doubt those two children could write two deeds at least 8 months prior to

. December 1954 on the basis that they are transferring the rights devolved on them from

Lokuhamy who is their mother. Therefore, the validity of the two deeds marked 104 and 106

cannot be disputed.

The 1" and 3,d Defendant-Appellants' pedigree is entirely different from Plaintiff-Defendant's

pedigree. According to 1" and 3,d Defendants, the Original Owner of the Land was one

Dingirala. Dingirala died leaving Kiribanda, Ungurala, Appuhamy and Singhappu. Therefore,

each of them entitled to an undivided 1/4. The said Kiribanda by a deed (the number of that

deed was not known to the Appellants) conveyed his 1/4th share to Lokuhamy and by deed

No.38826 (101) she transferred the same to the 1" Defendant, 2nd Defendant and Themanis

Singho.

The said Ungurala died leaving 7 children, namely; Abaran Singho, Thomas Singho, Luwis

Singho, Punchibanda, Punchi Menika alias Podinona, Kiri Menika and Podi Singho.

Then Abaran Singho transferred his undivided 1/14th share by deed No.38160 (104) to the 1"

Defendant Appellant. Thomas Singho transferred his undivided 1/28th share to 1" Defendant-

Appellant by deed No.39945 (105). The said Luwis Singho by deed No.38759 (106)

transferred his undivided 1/ 14th share to 1" Defendant-Appellant. Kiri Menika by deed No.255

(108) transferred her undivided 1/28 to the 1" Defendant-Appellant.

The said Punchi Menika alias Podinona died leaving Maginona, Babyhamy, 50binahamy,

Ranhamy and Siyathu Banda (5 children) and all of them by deed No.1097 (107) transferred

their undivided 1/28 share to 1" Defendant-Appellant. The said Podi Singho's rights were to

be left unallotted as devolution of those rights, were not known to the Appellant.

Page 5 of7

According to the Appellants pedegree, above said Singhappu (Dingirala:s son, out of four) had

passed away leaving Podinona, Punchirala, Mudalihamy, Podiappuhamy, Dingiribanda,

Ukkubanda, Siyathuhamy and Ran Menika and each of them got 1/8'h share out of 1/4'h share

of Singhappu. Podinona by deed No.29378 transferred her 1/8'h share (according to the 1st

Defendant-Appellant's evidence this 1/81h share must be out of 1/41h share of the land) to

Ukkubanda.

The Said Punchirala, Mudalihamy, Podiappuhamy and Dingiribanda by deed No.27234 (lP2)

transferred their 4/8 (according to the 1st Defendant-Appellant's evidence this 4/8'h share

must be out of 1/41h share of the Land) to Ukkubanda.

Therefore, 1st and 3,d Defendant-Appellants argued that the Plaintiff is entitled for only 6/8 x

X share of the Land, that is 6/32th share of the Land. 1" and 3,d Defendants claim that, 1st

Defendant-Appellant would be entitled to 11/42th share and 3,d Defendant-Appellant is

entitled to 5/42th share.

The Learned District Judge has failed to consider and analyze the evidence led and more

importantly has failed to examine the title of parties and thereby erred in law. It looks like

that the Learned District Judge has considered only two points, to come to the above

conclusion. They are as follows;

(1) He has noted that deed NO.38160 (104) and NO.38159 (106) are written on

material inheritance on the same day 28.04.1954. However, few months later

Lokuhamy transferred deed NO.38826 (101) on 29.12.1954. The Learned District

Judge questioned as to how Lokuhamy transferred her share in deed 101. Therefore,

Learned Trial Judge doesn't accept the Defendant's Pedigree.

This conclusion is entirely incorrect since in the schedule to the deed No.38160 (104), three

lands had been mentioned under No.1, 2 and 3 but maternal inheritance was referred under

No.1 only. Also, in the schedule to the deed No.38159 (106), there are five lands that had

been mentioned under five numbers 1 to 5 but under number 2 and 3 only maternal

inheritances were transferred.

(2) The Learned Trial Judge stated that the land in dispute called "Lidagawawatta" and

the deeds marked 101 to 108 do not refer Lidahawawatta but they refer some other

land called Lidawatta.

This conclusion is also incorrect as the schedule to the deeds marked 1D3 and 108 specially

says that land referred to "Lidagawawatta alias Lidawatta". It could be considered as one and

the same land.

. .

, Thus, it reflects that the Learned Judge had not carefully examined and analyzed the evidence

and had not investigated the title of parties under section 25 of the Partition Act. The need

for a careful investigation of all titles has been emphatically reiterated by our Courts in many

decisions. (Ferreira Vs Haniffa 15 NLR 445 and Fernando Vs Mohamadu Saibo 3 NLR 321) ,

In the above said circumstances, we set aside the judgment dated 15.08.2000 and re-

calculate the shares of the land in accordance with the pedigree of the l " and 3rd Defendant-

Appellants.

The new shares are as follows:

For the Plaintiff

For 1" Defendant

For 2nd Defendant

For 3rd Defendant

Unallotted

84/168

40/168

14/168

18/168

12/168

Interlocutory Decree be entered accordingly.

Appeal allowed.
