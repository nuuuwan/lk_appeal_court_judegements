ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

In this application, the 3rd Suspect-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) prays from this Court that he be enlarged on bail under Section

10(1)(a) of Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes Act No. 04 of 2015.

It is stated by the Petitioner that he had organised two media conferences

in December 2019 "to educate the public about the harassment faced by individuals and

their families attached to various intelligence branches of the armed forces due to

subjective, arbitrary and unjustifiable arrests of the security personnel by certain

individuals of the Police who are no longer in service ... ".

Subsequent to these two media conferences, the Petitioner was directed to

make a statement to Criminal Investigations Department after it had commenced

investigations into a complaint by the Registrar of the Magistrate's Court of Fort.

The Petitioner subsequently became aware that in relation to case No. B 732/09

2

,

pending before the said Court, an Attorney-at-Law who appeared for the

aggrieved party in the said matter had brought to the notice of Court that the

Petitioner had intimidated witnesses during the said media conferences.

Upon the complaint by the Registrar, the cm reported facts to the same

Court stating that the Petitioner has committed offences under Section 8 of the

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes Act No. 04 of 2015. He was

remanded on 31.01.2020, pending investigations.

It is the position of the Petitioner that the available material does not

justify the Petitioner being named as a suspect in the said case and asserts that

" ... in the circumstances of this case and especially in the absence any material

pertaining to threatening of witnesses it is contrary to law and illegal to invoke the

provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes Act No. 04 of 2015

and claims that there exists exceptional circumstances" warranting him to be released

on bail.

The Petitioner, in his attempt to satisfy this Court of the existence of

exceptional circumstances stated in his petition that his 17-year-old daughter had

to undergo emotional stress and social embarrassment due to the incarceration of

the Petitioner which received wide publicity. It is also stated that his daughter

was diagnosed by a Consultant Psychiatrist as suffering from a psychological

disorder. It is the opinion of the said Psychiatrist that " ... the return of the

Petitioner to his house would facilitate the recovery of the child" and if her condition is

worsened due to continued incarceration of the Petitioner, it would have an

irreparable effect on her life and therefore these circumstances should be

considered by this Court as exceptional. The Petitioner has annexed a report

issued by the Consultant Psychiatrist marked X15 to his petition.

3

The Respondents resisted the Petitioner's application and in their

objections it is stated that the 1st and 2nd suspects in case No. B732/09 were

indicted along with several others by the 2nd Respondent in case No.

HC/TAB/I448/2020 before a Trial at Bar. The said matter is pending before the

Trial at Bar, and one Lieutenant Commander Welagedara, is named as a witness

for the prosecution. During the media conferences, it is claimed by the

Respondents that the Petitioner had made" ... several allegations and/or threatening

remarks against the witnesses".

Learned President's Counsel submitted that the emotional and social

impact on the daughter of the Petitioner due to the continued incarceration of her

father had resulted in a psychologically termed illness of" Adjustment Disorder".

Learned President's Counsel had particularly invited the attention of Court to

the fact that she entertains suicidal thoughts. In the circumstances, he contended

that her illness is qualified to be accepted as an exceptional, a factor in favour of

the Petitioner, in the consideration of bail.

Learned Senior State Counsel for the Respondent submitted that although

he was sympathetic towards the young girl's psychologically traumatic

experience, he is unable to concede to the position that such circumstances are

exceptional in nature, since an arrest and detention of a family member will

undoubtedly results in varying degrees of adverse impact, both psychological

and financial, on his immediate family, and therefore the daughter of the

Petitioner too is not placed in a situation that is different to the one faced by a

daughter of any another detainee.

Referring to the medical report X 15, learned Senior State Counsel

submitted the fact that the young girl is entertaining suicidal thoughts is only

4

mentioned in the clinical history where the Consultant Psychiatrist interviewed

both her and her mother on that aspect. The medical expert did not confirm of

any tendency of harming herself as a result of " Adjustment Disorder".

In the backdrop these submissions made by Counsel on the factual and

legal aspects, this Court now proceeds to consider the application of the

Petitioner.

The allegation against the Petitioner is that he is concerned with an offence

under Section 8 of Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crimes Act No. 04

of 2015.

Both the Petitioner and Respondents have tendered the electronic version

of the media conferences the Petitioner had conducted annexed to their

respective pleadings. The question whether the Petitioner has committed an

offence under the said section of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of

Crimes Act No. 04 of 2015 is best left to the High Court since the learned Senior

State Counsel indicated that the 2nd Respondent has contemplated forwarding

an indictment once the investigative phase, in relation to the allegation of the

commission of an offence, has reached its conclusion. This Court therefore

deliberately refrains itself from making any observations upon the Petitioner's

conduct during the two media conferences as the issue before this Court is

whether to enlarge the Petitioner on bail or not.

Section 10(1)(a) of the said Act states that" ... no person suspected, accused or

convicted of such an offence shall be enlarged on bail, unless under exceptional

circumstances by the Court of Appeal."

In order to satisfy this Court that the mental health of the Petitioner's

daughter, fulfils the said criterion on which the Legislature had provided for in

5

enlarging the persons who are concerned with offences under Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crimes Act No. 04 of 2015, learned President's Counsel,

laid emphasis on the probability of a suicide as a direct result of the said mental

condition.

The report (marked as XIS), issued by the Consultant Psychiatrist, is dated

28.04.2020. It is in relation to the clinical history obtained from the patient and

her mother the reference to suicide is made. It is stated therein the patient

presented the Consultant with a history of " ... feeling sad with crying episodes,

feeling anxious and inner restlessness, avoidance of friends and relatives due to social

embarrassment, thoughts of ending her life, outbursts of anger and irritability mainly

directed at her family members and disturbed health."

The Consultant Psychiatrist states the clinical features indicate his patient

has an "Adjustment Disorder". The impact of the said illness is stated as " ... her

education getting disrupted, as she could not concentrate on her academic work and

avoided attending academic classes due to social embarrassment". She was treated

using Psychological Therapy in the form of Supportive Therapy and was

requested to attend outpatient clinic for continuation of medical care. In view of

the above, learned Consultant is of the view that her" ... recovery will be facilitated

with the return of her father to her home."

This Court understands with empathy of the anxiety created in the young

mind of a girl of 17 years, confronted with an unpleasant situation to which she

had not contributed at all to but was forced to be in. In general terms, the clinical

history as recorded by the Consultant indicate the way any average person

would feel when a family member being incarcerated for some time. The adverse

impact of the particular mental disorder that had been diagnosed with the young

6

. '

D

girl apparently is confined to her studies. She is fortunate to be placed under the

care of a qualified and experienced Psychiatrist with the onset of her illness.

As the learned Senior State Counsel submitted, this is an unfortunate but

an inevitable result, each time when a Court orders remanding a person in

judicial custody. Being deprived of personal liberty no doubt creates an adverse

psychological impact on such person as well as his dependents. Often the Courts

are expected to make a ruling on the interests of the suspect conflicting with the

interests of the society at large, represented by the State, by striking a balance

between the two.

In view of these considerations, the all-important question this Court must

decide is whether the psychological impact on the daughter of the Petitioner due

to his continued incarceration could be considered as an exceptional when

compared to the psychological impact suffered by any other girl who is placed

under similar circumstances ?

The Respondents, in their objections referred to a quotation from the

judgment of the Supreme Court in Attorney General v Ediriweera 2006 BLR 12,

where it is stated that;

"It is trite law that family circumstances are not considered to be

exceptional but circumstances which are general and operative in

almost all the cases. The facts and circumstances of the case must

take it out of the ordinary, creating circumstances that are

sufficiently exceptional to merit the grant of bail ... ".

This Court, having considered the circumstances urged by the learned

President's Counsel, is of the view that they fail to qualify themselves from the

7

.'

circumstances that are of a "general" in nature to circumstances that are" out of

ordinary", so that they could be taken as "exceptional" .

Therefore, the Petitioner's application to enlarge himself on bail is

refused.

His Petition is accordingly dismissed with no costs.
