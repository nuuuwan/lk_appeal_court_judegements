Counsel for the Appellant moves to withdraw the appeal against both

convictions. Accordingly, convictions with regard to 1 st and 2nd charges are

affirmed. Thereafter, the counsel makes submissions to the effect that the

sentence imposed with regard to the 2nd charge is illegal and accordingly it

has to be one half of the maximum prescribed sentence in terms of Section

490 of the Penal Code.

Accordingly, Appellant IS sentenced to 10 years Rigorous

Imprisonment. Sentences of both charges to run concurrently and also to

implement the sentence from the date of conviction and sentence namely,

01.08.2017. Rest of the sentences will remain unchanged.
