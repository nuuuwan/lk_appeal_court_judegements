Argued on: 03.09.2020

Decided on: 22.10.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

A policy decision was taken by the then Government in 2002 to

develop small-scale hydro power projects to generate electrical

energy. By a newspaper advertisement, the 3rd Respondent

Mahawali Authority of Sri Lanka invited proposals to inter alia

develop a hydro power project in Gatambe, Kandy (on the

Mahaweli river), which is the subject matter of this application.

The Petitioner was selected as the successful project proponent.

The 5th Respondent Central Environmental Authority appointed

the 3rd Respondent as the Project Approving Agency. The 3rd

Respondent sent the Petitioner the Terms of Reference for the

Environmental Impact Assessment Report to be prepared in

4

order to consider the project for approval. The Environmental

Impact Assessment Report marked X was tendered and the

Technical Evaluation Committee of the 3rd Respondent, which

was appointed to evaluate inter alia the impact of this project on

the environment, recommended that approval be granted for the

project. Accordingly, the 3rd Respondent, with the concurrence

of the 5th Respondent Central Environmental Authority, granted

approval for the project by P3(f) for a period of three years from

22.02.2002, subject to the terms and conditions set out therein.

Pursuant to the said approval, as seen from P4(a)-P4(e), the

Ministry of Power and Energy, the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy

Authority, and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka gave

their respective approvals. The Lease Agreement P4(f) was

signed between the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent leasing

out an identified portion of land for the project, subject to

conditions. Thereafter, the 3rd Respondent sent the Petitioner

Notice of Termination of the Lease Agreement on the ground of

failure to attain milestones in breach of the terms of the

Agreement. Upon a case being filed in the Commercial High

Court, as seen from P5(d), the matter was settled, subject to

terms.

After this settlement, the Petitioner mobilised its staff and

commenced site clearance expeditiously, which included

blasting operations onsite. By that time, the approval given for

implementation of the project by P3(f) had lapsed and several

parties, including members of the general public, the Buddhist

clergy and various Government Departments, vehemently

protested against the project, and in particular the rock blasting

operations on the Mahaweli river, as it presented a devastating

5

environmental threat. Complaints were also made about

damage caused to nearby houses and an ancient temple, Seema

Malakaya, as a result of the said operations. The 3rd

Respondent, tendering 3R7, says it received 47 complaints. The

5th Respondent directed the Petitioner to cease rock blasting

operations.

The 5th Respondent refused to grant concurrence for the

extension of environmental approval for the project. This was

informed to the Director General of the 3rd Respondent by 5R9,

which reads as follows:

GETAMBE MINI HYDRO POWER PROJECT ON MAHAWELI

GANGA

This has reference to your letter dated 10th May 2011

requesting Central Environmental Authority (CEA)

concurrence for the extension of the validity period of

environmental approval granted on 22.02.2007 by the

MASL for the above project.

The CEA concurred with your decision for granting the

aforesaid approval in 2007 after study of the EIA report

dated 18.01.2007 submitted by the Asia Hydro Power (Pvt)

Ltd. The CEA has now received various complaints from the

neighbouring public and organisations on some damages

caused by the project to the surrounding environment

during implementation of the project. Although the original

approval was granted by the MASL with the concurrence of

the CEA, several unforeseen impacts seem to have arisen

which require to be mitigated prior to further

6

implementation of the project as specified in Condition Nos.

A.11 and A.12 of the environmental approval letter.

The CEA convened meetings on 26.07.2011 and

25.10.2011 together with all stakeholders to discuss the

issues raised by the public. Further a field inspection was

also carried out on 05.08.2011 to further clarify the issues.

The CEA, having studied the issues discussed at the

aforesaid meetings and the field visit, notes the following:

1. The project has resulted in the following issues which

are of serious concern to the neighbourhood.

Damages to the Seemamalakaya due to rock

excavation and blasting for construction of the weir.

Since extensive rock excavations are to be done for

construction of the canal and the power house further

damages could be anticipated.

Threats to land stability and increased erosion of

river bank due to heavy earth works within the river

stretch causing serious threats to Peradeniya

Katugastota road and Rajasinghe Mawatha. This

situation may be worsened with the ponding effect in

the upstream area.

Threats to endemic fauna and flora species living

within the stretch due to rock blasting activities and

change of flow characteristics.

Relocation of people living in the inundation area in

an unsuitable site.

7

2. Since some of these issues have arisen fairly recently

and have not been considered in the EIA report which

was prepared in 2007, no satisfactory mitigatory

measures to resolve the above issues have been

suggested by the project proponent in the EIA report or

in subsequent documents. Further, it appears that due

attention has not been paid to the above issues during

the Technical Evaluation of the EIA report. Important

stakeholders such as the National Building Research

Organisation, Natural Resources Management Centre of

Dept. of Agriculture, Road Development Authority and

the Udarata Amarapura Nikaya Sanga Sabha have not

been consulted during the EIA study and the EIA

evaluation.

3. The socio economic data contained in the EIA report

appears to be incorrect and thus needs to be updated

with correct data.

Based on the above observations, the CEA wishes to inform

you that the concurrence of the CEA could be considered for

issuing of environmental approval for the project only if the

above issues are resolved satisfactorily by the MASL.

Accordingly, please submit us your proposal for resolving

the above issues in consultation with the project proponent

and required experts, in order for us to grant our

concurrence.

The 3rd Respondent conveyed the same to the Petitioner by P6(c).

8

The 3rd Respondent then sent fresh Terms of Reference by P6(e)

followed by P6(g) to the Petitioner, requesting a supplementary

Environmental Impact Assessment Report to be considered for

granting approval for the project.

The Petitioner submitted an Addendum to the Environmental

Impact Assessment Report marked P6(h), which was accepted by

the Technical Evaluation Committee of the 3rd Respondent,

subject to the conditions in P6(i)(1).

Thereafter, the Petitioner tendered a fuller Addendum to the

Environmental Impact Assessment Report marked X1 to the 3rd

Respondent, who approved the said Report and sent it to the 5th

Respondent by P6(n) for the latters concurrence.

The 3rd Respondent thereafter informed the Petitioner by P9(a)

that the 5th Respondent had declined to concur with the decision

of the 3rd Respondent to grant approval for the implementation

of the project.

The letter sent by the 5th Respondent to the 3rd Respondent

refusing approval marked 5R6 reads as follows:

THE PROPOSED GATAMBE MINI HYDRO POWER PROJECT

ON MAHAWELI GANGA (10MW)

ADDENDUM TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

ASSESSMENT REPORT

This has reference to your letter No. RBM/CMT/17/1 & 2(A)

dated 29.03.2014 regarding the above project.

9

The CEA, having carefully studied the Addendum to the EIA

report dated May 2013 submitted to you by the Asia Hydro

Power Generation (Pvt) Ltd., written public comments on the

report and report of the Technical Evaluation Committee of

the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka, has noted that

implementation of the proposed project will have serious

environmental consequences especially with regard to the

following:

1. The stretch of the river and its surroundings that will be

mainly affected by the project can be classified as a

highly sensitive habitat where several rare, threatened,

endemic species are found. Some species present in the

project area have been protected under the Fauna and

Flora Protection Ordinance. Eg. Labio fisherim

Lagenendra piatimisse, Podostomacea spp.

The affected river stretch is one of the few locations

where these protected species are recorded at present.

2. The river stretch will be severely disturbed / damaged

due to extensive rock excavation during construction of

the project and low flows during operation of the project.

These two causes will have a significant and irreversible

impact on the population of endangered, threatened and

protected species that inhabit the river.

3. Granting approval for a project of this nature at the

identified site would amount to an act of encouragement

to destroy legally protected, threatened and endangered

species that live in this area.

10

In view of the aforesaid reasons, under and by virtue of the

powers vested in this Authority under the provisions of the

National Environmental Act, this Authority hereby declines

to concur with your decision to grant approval for the

implementation of the above project.

The Petitioner preferred an appeal marked P9(b)/P10(a) against

the said refusal to the Secretary to the subject Ministry, in terms

of section 23(DD)(1) of the National Environmental Act. After a

hearing, the appeal was dismissed by P11. This means extension

of the environmental clearance was denied, and the Petitioner

could not proceed with the project.

After the appeal was dismissed, the 1st Respondent, the then

President of the Republic who was also the subject Minister,

acting in terms of sections 24C and 24D of the National

Environmental Act read with Article 44 of the Constitution

declared an area in extent of 59.4 hectares comprising the

Mahaweli river and all the islands falling within it situated in

Kandy, which included the project land, as the Waratenna-

Hakkinda Environmental Protection Area by the Gazette marked

P12. According to schedule II to the said Gazette, the permitted

uses for this area do not include a mini hydropower generation

project.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking the following reliefs:

(a) To grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of

certiorari to quash the order made by the 8th Respondent

marked P11, by which the appeal marked P9b made by

the Petitioner was rejected.

11

(b) To grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of

mandamus to compel the 5th Respondent to allow the

appeal made in terms of section 23(DD) of the National

Environmental Act and/or to grant the reliefs sought in

the said appeal marked P9b made by the Petitioner

and/or to direct the 5th Respondent to approve the

Addendum to the Environmental Impact Assessment

Report and the responses provided by the Petitioner to

the comments made by the public, and/or to grant their

concurrence.

(c) To grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of

certiorari quashing the Environmental Protection order

marked P14 above, made by the 1st Respondent under

Section 24 of the National Environmental Act and

published in the Government Gazette Extraordinary

bearing No.2024/6 dated 19th of June 2017.

According to the Petitioner, the dismissal of the appeal is wrong

in law and in fact for the following reasons:

(i) The 8th Respondent has failed to consider the fact that the

Appeal was lodged against the decision taken by the 5th

Respondent declining to concur with the findings of the

Technical Evaluation Committee that the Addendum to the

Environmental Impact Assessment and the responses

submitted to the public comments were inadequate.

(ii) The 8th Respondent has failed to consider the fact that the

parties had in consultation over a number of sittings agreed

upon mitigatory measures to be developed and put in place

12

which would ensure that the fauna and flora in the area

would be unaffected by the construction carried out by the

Petitioner.

(iii) The 8th Respondent has failed to consider the fact that the

5th Respondent had after considerable research and

discussion refused to concur with the Technical Evaluation

Committee only due to the fact that (1) the stretch of the

river and its surrounding area that will be mainly affected

by the project can be classified as a highly sensitive habitat

where several rare, threatened, endemic species are found

and/or (2) the river stretch will be disturbed/ damaged due

to extension rock evacuation during construction of the

project and low flows during the operation of the project

and (3) granting approval for a project of this nature at the

identified sites would amount to an act of encouragement to

destroy legally protected threatened and endangered

species that line in this area and not due to socio-economic

reasons.

(iv) The 8th Respondent has failed to consider the fact that the

5th Respondent had declined to concur with the Technical

Evaluation Committee due to the fear that the

Seemamalakaya would be affected by such construction.

(v) The 8th Respondent has failed to consider the fact that this

project is of national importance and that the 3rd

Respondent would be entitled to an annual revenue of Rs.

100 million by this project.

13

(vi) The 8th Respondent has failed to take into consideration the

national importance of the project and the overall well being

of the state and the citizens in making the said order.

The main grouse of the Petitioner against the appeal decision

seems to be the opportunity given to third parties by the

Secretary to the Ministry, acting as the appellate body, to

express their views at the hearing of the appeal, when the appeal

was limited to three specific grounds as stated in P9(a)/5R6

quoted above.

I regret my inability to agree with this submission. This appeal

under the Environmental Protection Act is unique. The appellate

procedure is set out in Gazette No.850/4 dated 20.12.1994. The

Regulations set out in the said Gazette are cited as the

National Environmental (Appellate Procedure) Regulations of

1994. Regulation 5 thereof says: All appeals received shall

be entered on a register to be maintained by the Secretary for

such purpose. Such register or an extract thereof duly

authenticated by the Secretary shall be a public document open

for public inspection at the office of Ministry of the Minister in

charge of the subject of Environment during any working day.

Providing for the appeal registry to be a public document open

to general inspection makes it clear that any member of the

public may raise their concerns over the subject matter.

Regulation 11 says: The Secretary may also notify the

authority, government department, corporation, statutory body,

local authority or public officer as the case may be, to submit

its comments or observations on the appeal, and may require

them to be present and make submissions at any hearing

14

through an officer duly authorised in writing or through an

Attorney-at-law or the Attorney-General. Hence, the appeal

need not be confined to what is stated by the Petitioner in the

Petition of Appeal. This is understandably due to the

sensitive nature of the subject being the environment, the

protection of which falls on not only successive Governments

but each and every individual in society.

The 5th Respondent tenders with its statement of objections

an array of documents, 5R1-5R5, 5R11, 5R14, 5R16, 1R6-

1R61 etc., received from various Government and non-

Government institutions, such as the Pradeshiya Sabha

Harispattuwa, Seema Malakaya Arakshana Bhikshu Saha

Gihi Bala Mandalaya, Lawyers for the Environment in Kandy,

Sri Lanka Young Zoologists Association, Haritha Diyatha

Environmental Association, Director General of Wildlife

Conservation, and the Ministry of Environment and

Renewable Energy, advocating for the protection of the

Warathenna-Hakkinda area in which the project of the

Petitioner was situated.

As seen from inter alia 5R12 and 5R13, before declining

concurrence for the implementation of this project, the 5th

Respondent summoned a committee comprising experts in

the relevant fields, i.e. representatives of the Environmental

Council, the Department of Wildlife Conservation, the

National Aquatic Resources Research and Development

Agency, the Biodiversity Secretariat of the Ministry of

Mahaweli Development and Environment, the Department of

15

Zoology of the University of Peradeniya and the 5th

Respondent itself, to understand the issue and consider it

from the proper perspective. All the experts recommended

protection of the said area and that the project not be allowed

to progress. The recommendations made in this regard are

found in inter alia 5R16-5R19.

Development of a mini hydropower project on the Mahaweli river

and its impact on the environment is a specialised subject that

this Court is ill-equipped to handle in a writ application.

In Public Interest Law Foundation v. Central Environmental

Authority [2001] 3 Sri LR 330, the Petitioner sought to quash by

certiorari the decision of the Central Environmental Authority to

approve the construction of the Southern Expressway inter alia

on the basis that there was a failure to analyse the relevant data

and a lack of consideration of reasonable and environmentally

friendly alternatives that would have minimised the damage to

the environment, and the Environmental Impact Assessment

Report did not provide proper, intelligible and adequate reasons

for the rejection of alternatives to the project. Refusing the

application of the Petitioner, this Court stated, inter alia, at 333:

The Court is ill equipped, in any event, to form an opinion

on environmental matters they being best left to people

who have specialised knowledge and skills in such

spheres. Even if a matter may seem to be preeminently one

of public law, the Courts may decline to exercise review

because it is felt that the matter is not justiciable, i.e. not

suitable to judicial determination. The reason for non-

16

justiciability is that Judges are not expert enough deal with

the matter.

The appeal decision confirming the 5th Respondents refusal to

give concurrence for the implementation of the project cannot, in

the facts and circumstances of this case, be considered

erroneous. Therefore, the said decision cannot be quashed by a

writ of certiorari.

By the same token, the 5th Respondent cannot be compelled to

approve the Addendum to the Environmental Impact

Assessment Report by way of a writ of mandamus.

A declaration of land, inclusive of the area that is the subject

matter of this application, as an environmental protection area

by the President upon the advice and recommendations of

experts cannot be considered unreasonable, arbitrary and in

violation of the Petitioners legitimate expectations.

The Petitioners appeal was dismissed after a hearing. After the

said appeal decision, the Petitioner cannot say it should have

been heard again prior to the relevant area being declared an

environmental protection area.

It may be noted that the Petitioner was to be given only 8.9

hectares for this project; the gazetted land extends up to 59.4

hectares. Hence the Petitioner cannot say the area was declared

an environmental protection area in order to deny him the

project.

By the time the Gazette was issued, the Petitioners project was

not a live issue, with even the appeal having been heard and

17

decided against the Petitioner. Section 23(DD)(2) of the National

Environmental Act says the appeal decision is final (although I

agree that the said decision is subject to judicial review). Hence

there was no necessity to grant him another opportunity of being

heard prior to the area being declared an environmental

protection area.

In the unique facts and circumstances of this case, the

Petitioners claim based on legitimate expectation cannot

succeed. During the period approval had been granted for

implementation of the project, the Petitioner did nothing. After

that period lapsed, when the Petitioner sought approval on the

second occasion, the circumstances had changed with the

passage of time. Legitimate expectation is not an absolute

principle to be applied irrespective of a change in circumstances.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner without costs.
