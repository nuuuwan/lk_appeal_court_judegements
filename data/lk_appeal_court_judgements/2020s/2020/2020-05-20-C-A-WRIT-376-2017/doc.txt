Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Shantha Jayawardena with Chamara

Nanayakkarawasam for the Petitioner.

Maithree Amarasinghe, S.C., for the

Respondents.

Argued on: 24.02.2020

Decided on: 20.05.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by way of a

writ of certiorari: (a) the order of the University Services Appeals

Board (hereinafter Appeal Board) dated 15.08.2017 marked

P25/R24; (b) the undated disciplinary order of the University

Council marked P14; (c) any punishment imposed on the

Petitioner upon the order of the Appeal Board. The Petitioner

also seeks a writ of mandamus directing the Vice Chancellor, the

University Grants Commission and the University Council (a) to

consider him for promotion to Senior Lecturer Grade I with effect

from 27.04.2007; and (b) to restore his deferred salary

increments and grant him arrears of salary.

6

The facts which led to the filing of this application can be best

understood by paragraph 4 of the statement of objections of the

Respondents dated 31.05.2019. It gives the events in

chronological order.

The Petitioner is a Senior Lecturer Grade II of the University of

Peradeniya. He lectured, set the question paper, prepared the

marking scheme, and examined the answer scripts of the

Corporate Governance subject of the post-graduate diploma

course for the year 2008/2009, offered by the Universitys

Department of Management Studies. After the examination, the

marks were released: out of 39 students, 12 failed the said

subject. The Head of the Department together with the Course

Coordinator instructed the Petitioner to re-examine the answer

scripts of those who had failed and to add marks in order to

increase the pass rate. Further to this, two more candidates

passed. Thus, out of 39 candidates, 29 passed.

There were complaints against the Petitioner, which were

reported by the Dean to the Vice Chancellor. Vide R4 and R5.

The Departmental Higher Degrees Committee by R6 decided to

send the answer scripts of the Corporate Governance subject

marked by the Petitioner for a second marking to an examiner

outside the University of Peradeniya. Dr. Samanthi Senaratne of

the University of Sri Jayewardenepura was nominated for this

purpose.

However, Dr. Senaratne returned the answer scripts without

making them, along with an adverse report against the

Petitioner marked R10. The reasons given by her are as follows:

7

The above course question paper was sent to me for second

marking together with the marking scheme.

While performing the second marking, I found discrepancies

among questions and answers suggested for marking.

Almost all the questions are vague and answers suggested

were very specific.

Since the questions are very vague or general questions,

specific answers cannot be expected. For example, the

students were asked to discuss the following:

Corporate governance is a broader concept. Discuss. But

in the marking scheme, students were expected to write six

definitions of the corporate governance and marks were

given only for definitions.

Owing to the above mentioned reasons, the answers

written by the students deviated from the suggested

answers in the marking scheme.

Due to the above mentioned reasons, I regret to inform that I

am unable to proceed with the second marking.

Taking the contents of R10 into serious consideration, the

Faculty Higher Degrees Committee by R11 appointed [a five-

member] committee of examiners to examine the answer

scripts.

Although this five-member committee was appointed to re-

scrutinize the relevant answer scripts1 or to examine the

1 Vide paragraph 4(xii) of the statement of objections of the Respondents.

8

answer scripts,2 what they admittedly did, as seen from R13,

was standardisation of the marks. This was unequivocally

admitted by learned State Counsel for the Respondents at the

argument. The five-member committee did not re-examine or re-

scrutinise the answer scripts. They merely added marks to

increase the pass rate. This was done in an ad hoc manner

without any rational basis. This approach is against the decision

of the Faculty Higher Degrees Committee in R11, which was to

have the answer scripts re-examined. At the end of the day,

after standardisation of the marks, 37 out of 39 candidates

passed.

Thereafter, the Dean by R14 wrote to the Vice Chancellor setting

out the antecedents in relation to the marking of the answer

scripts and highlighting that the Vice Chancellor could take

disciplinary action against the Petitioner, if so desired. The

relevant portion of R14 reads as follows:

However, the members of the Higher Degrees Committee

feel that though the irregularities marking of the

examination of the relevant course have been corrected, it

may be necessary to inquire into the conduct and teaching

of the relevant lecturer with a view to taking disciplinary

action, if warranted. Such a course of action is however

outside the purview of the Higher Degrees Committee, and

as such I leave it to you.

The Vice Chancellor placed this issue before the University

Council and the Council decided to hold a preliminary

2 Vide R11.

9

investigation. After the preliminary investigation, two charge

sheets were served on the Petitioner. One was in relation to the

correction of answer scripts (R17), and the other in relation to

examination fraud (R17A). After an inquiry, the Petitioner was

exonerated from the fraud charges in R17A. Of the exam related

charges in R17, he was found guilty on Counts (a), (b) and (c);

also (f) and (g), which are consequential charges arising out of

(a)-(c). Charges (a)-(c) are as follows:

Purely upon the findings of the disciplinary inquiry, the

University Council imposed punishment based on negligence

on the part of the Petitioner. Vide R20 and R21. The

punishment was deferment of promotion for four years and

reduction in seniority by four years.

In my view, count (a) is unspecific and obscure, and thereby

difficult to defend against, which is unfair by the Petitioner. The

allegation is that the Petitioner failed to properly perform his

duties in relation to examining the answer scripts of the

Corporate Governance subject.

Count (b) alleges that due to the Petitioners negligence,

approximately 17 candidates were falsely considered as having

failed the Corporate Governance paper, and that the Petitioner

wrongfully suppressed facts in this regard.

When the findings of the Preliminary Inquiry were placed before

the University Council, one member of the Council, as seen from

R20, expressed his concerns as to the guilt of the Petitioner

regarding count (b). This portion reads as follows:

Meanwhile, drawing the attention of the Council in

particular to Charge (), a member queried as to whether

the charge had been proven beyond doubt, highlighting

certain doubtful areas. A member however pointed out that

11

it would not be appropriate to challenge the findings at this

stage since a preliminary inquiry has already been held

into the matter, and therefore, the task of the Council is to

take a decision based on the findings of the formal inquiry.

Adding further, he said that the accused is at liberty to

appeal if he has facts to prove his innocence.

Count (c) pertains to unscrupulously adding marks to certain

answer scripts.

Counts (b) and (c) are serious charges which have criminal

elements embedded in them requiring a high degree of proof.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, it is not an easy task

to prove these charges.

Being a strict marker does not mean the examiner is dishonest.

If that were true, the same argument can be brought against

examiners who are prepared to give marks lavishly to increase

the pass rate. It is naive to think that the examiners who

passed 37 out of 39 students acted bona fide, whereas the

examiner who passed 29 out of 39 students acted mala fide. I

have already explained how the 37 students were passed by the

five-member committee.

The University Council did not make any independent

assessment of the findings of the Preliminary Inquiry. Instead,

based on the said findings, the Council imposed punishment on

the ground of negligence.

The relevant portion of R20 reads as follows:

12

The Council observed that Negligence warrants imposing

one or more of the major punishments defined in Section 4.2

of Chapter XXII of the Establishments Code of the UGC and

HEIs, as listed on page C-05.

Accordingly, after some deliberation the Council decided to

impose the following punishments to the accused officer,

based on the punishments depicted in the EB Code.

a) Deferment of promotion for a period of 04 years [Vide

Punishment 3]

b) Reduction in seniority by 04 years [Vide Punishment

4]

I fail to understand how punishment was imposed on the

ground of negligence.

The Petitioner appealed to the University Appeal Board against

this punishment, as he is entitled to do in terms of section 86 of

the Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978, as amended.

The Appeal Board by R24 dismissed the Petitioners appeal but

set aside the punishment, directing the University Council to

impose punishment in respect of each count on which the

Petitioner was found guilty.

Whilst this case was pending, the Council slightly reduced the

Petitioners punishment by R26.

I will start with the Appeal Board decision R24.

13

The Appeal Board did not consider the merits of the Petitioners

appeal made against the decision of the University Council, and

dismissed the appeal by making a brief order stating that the

Council followed the proper procedure in meting out the

punishment to the Petitioner and therefore the Appeal Board

had no jurisdiction to go into the merits of the appeal. The

Appeal Board did not even consider the charges for which the

Petitioner was found guilty.

The relevant part of the Appeal Board decision dated 15.08.2017

P25/R24 reads as follows:

This Board is of the view that the inquiry procedure

followed by the Council is correct and the correctness of the

findings of the inquiring officer is not a matter this Board is

competent to decide upon. If the inquiry procedure is correct

and a legitimate punishment has been imposed, there

cannot be any intervention by this Board.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner vehemently submits that the

Appeal Board has manifestly acted as a body of judicial review

and not as an appellate body and, on this ground alone, the

decision of the Appeal Board should be quashed by certiorari.

There is a great force in this argument. The approach adopted

by the Appeal Board is the approach adopted by this Court in

exercising jurisdiction under judicial review.

Unlike in judicial review, on appeal the appellate body shall

decide the appeal on merits unless the appeal can be decided on

any other ground, be it legal or procedural.

14

Wade in his treatise Administrative Law (11th edition) states:

The system of judicial review is radically different from the

system of appeals. When hearing an appeal the court is

concerned with the merits of a decision: is it correct? When

subjecting some administrative act or order to judicial

review, the court is concerned with its legality: is it within

the limits of the powers granted? On an appeal the question

is right or wrong? On review the question is lawful or

unlawful?

In Public Interest Law Foundation v. Central Environmental

Authority [2001] 3 Sri LR 330 at 334, Gunawardena, J. states:

There is a distinction between appeal and review. If one

appeals against a decision, one is claiming that the decision

is wrong and that appellate authority or court should

change the decision. The Court of Appeal, if it is persuaded

by the merits of the case (appeal), may allow the appeal

and thereby substitute its view for that of the Court or

tribunal of first instance. Under judicial review procedure,

the Court of Appeal is not concerned with the merits of the

case, that is, whether the decision was right or wrong, but

whether the decision is lawful or not.

There cannot be any dispute that the University Appeal Board is

an appellate body and certainly not a body of Judicial Review.

In order to emphasise that the approach of the Appeal Board in

the instant matter is fundamentally flawed, learned Counsel for

the Petitioner drew the attention of the Court to Section 18 of

15

the University Services Appeals Board Ordinance3 (made in

terms of section 88 of the Universities Act), which states: the

Appeal Board may in the interest of justice permit [even] oral

evidence to be led at such hearing.

Learned State Counsel, if I understand correctly, does not say

that the approach of the Appeal Board, as reflected in the above

quoted portion, is correct. However, learned Counsel

endeavours to justify the Appeal Board decision by stating that

the parameters of the appeal before the Appeal Board were

demarcated by the Petitioner himself, as reflected in R23, and

the Appeal Board addressed only those issues identified by the

Petitioner and, therefore, it cannot now lie in the mouth of the

Petitioner to complain that the Appeal Board did not consider

his appeal on merits. What State Counsel attempts to say here

is that the Petitioner raised only procedural defects and did not

canvass the Appeal on merits. I am unable to agree with this

submission.

Perusal of R23 reveals that after the Attorney-at-Law for the

Petitioner made brief submissions, the Appeal Board (not the

Petitioner) identified 03 major issues and so recorded the

same. This does not exclude minor issues. There was a

Petition of Appeal which preceded the hearing of the appeal.

Therefore, the submission that the Petitioner decided the scope

of the appeal is incorrect.

In any event, the three major issues identified are not purely

procedural issues. For instance, the third issue is not purely

3 This is gazetted in Gazette No.679/12 dated 11.09.1991.

16

procedural. It involves a decision on questions of fact, i.e.

whether re-marking was done by competent examiners

appointed by the Senate. This has been answered in the

affirmative by the Appeal Board in R24. This finding, as I will

demonstrate later, is incorrect. I highlight only one matter here.

But I need not even go that far. The whole process, in my view,

is fundamentally flawed from the very outset.

The gravamen of the argument of the Petitioner in different

forabefore the Disciplinary Inquiry, University Services Appeals

Board, and this Courtis that the issue here is in relation to

academic matters and, therefore, it is wrong on the part of the

Dean to have referred it straight to the University Council

bypassing the Senate, the latter having authority on academic

matters. In terms of section 44 of the Universities Act, the

Council shall be the executive body and governing authority of

the University; in terms of section 46 University shall have a

Senate which shall be the academic authority of the University.

This is undisputed. The Appeal Board accepts this in the

impugned order. In the impugned order, the Appeal Board inter

alia states as follows: This Board is not inclined to agree with the

Appellant that a disciplinary inquiry of an examiner is an

academic matter that has to be referred to the Senate for

approval. Matters pertaining to curriculum, examinations and the

approval of results of examinations would be academic matters

that need the approval of the Senate. However a disciplinary

inquiry in respect of the conduct of an examiner, in our view, does

not fall into that category.

17

The Appeal Board has considered the decision of the University

Council to punish the Petitioner as a disciplinary matter.

Learned State Counsel also vigorously submits that the Council

is the disciplinary authority of the Petitioner and therefore the

Council correctly imposed punishment based on the findings of

the preliminary inquiry. This is a superficial approach to the

issue.

How did this become a disciplinary matter? On what basis?

This I have already narrated. If I may repeat, by R6, the

Departmental Higher Degrees Committee decided to send the

answer scripts for a second marking to an examiner outside the

University of Peradeniya and selected Dr. Samanthi Senaratne of

the University of Sri Jayewardenepura for this purpose. By R10,

Dr. Senaratne returned the answer scripts with an adverse

report. Based on the said findings, a five-member committee

was appointed to examine the answer scripts, but, instead of re-

examining the answer scripts, the committee standardised the

marks and passed all but two candidates. It is in this context

that the Dean, by R14, informed the Vice Chancellor to take

disciplinary action, if warranted.

Counsel for the Petitioner submits that once results are released

with the approval of the Senate, the Faculty Higher Degrees

Committee cannot decide to appoint examiners to re-examine

the answer scripts without the approval of the Senate.

In reply, State Counsel submits that the initial results were

released subject to the approval of the Senate, and the Senate

only approved the standardised results. This submission is

18

incorrect. At page 3 of the written submissions of the

Respondents, the Respondents state:

The Faculty HDC unanimously decided to standardize the

marks after taking into consideration of the above

observations. Accordingly, the FHDC appointed a

subcommittee to re-scrutinize the papers among the

members already approved by the Senate. (emphasis mine)

By R14 dated 15.07.2010, the Dean has inter alia informed the

Vice Chancellor as follows:

The committee submitted their evaluation with a report

which is annexed. According to their evaluation, out of 12

students failed under first marking, 10 have obtained pass

marks. These results were taken up and approved at an

examiners board meeting held on 24th June 2010 and

results were released. (emphasis mine)

The evaluation report referred to here is the standardised results

sheet, which was signed by the members of the five-member

committee on 24.06.2010. According to the paragraph quoted

above, the standardised results had been approved at the

examiners board meeting held on 24.06.2010 and the results

were released thereafter. There was no Senate approval. R14 is

dated 15.07.2010.

State Counsel, referring to the Regulations made by the Senate

and approved by the University Council under section 136 read

with section 24 of the Universities Act (marked X1 in P24A),

submits that as this is a post graduate diploma course, the

19

Faculty Higher Degrees Committee can appoint examiners for re-

correction, and hence the course of action adopted is correct. I

am unable to agree.

Under Part V-Examinations of the said Regulations, 5.1 states

that Examiners for all postgraduate examinations will be

recommended by the Departmental HDC through the Faculty HDC

to the Faculty Board and shall be approved by the Senate.

It is the position of the Respondents in paragraph 11 of their

statement of objections that the Senate approved examiners for

the relevant year (2008/2009), as evidenced by R28, and two

members of the five-member panel of examiners were selected

from the said list approved by the Senate.

However, firstly, there is no indication in R28 that the examiners

stated therein were approved by the Senate. R28 only goes to

prove that eight names were approved by the Faculty Board, not

by the Senate. The Faculty Board or Departmental Higher

Degrees Committee or Faculty Higher Degrees Committee cannot

appoint examiners; that shall be done by the Senate on the

recommendation of the Faculty Board and said Higher Degrees

Committees. Vide, inter alia, section 48(3) of the Universities Act.

I will assume for the time being that the eight names in R28

were approved by the Senate. But what about the original

second examiner who played the pivotal role in this whole

exerciseDr. Samanthi Senaratne of the University of Sri

Jayewardenepura? Dr. Senaratne was undoubtedly appointed

by the Faculty Higher Degrees Committee without the approval

of the Senate. She technically re-examined the answer scripts

20

but did not send the revised marks due to reasons given in

writing. That was the starting point of this episode. The

appointment of Dr. Senaratne by the Departmental Higher

Degrees Committee is ultra vires.

The Respondents state that the names of the five-member

committee appointed by the Faculty Higher Degrees Committee

to re-examine the answer scripts were taken from R28, which

they say has been approved by the Senate. However, even

assuming that R28 contains a list of examiners approved by the

Senate, only two of the five-member committee are included in

R28. Learned State Counsel admits it. This means, the

majority of the said committee did not comprise examiners

approved by the Senate. Then, the decision taken by the five-

member committee to scrutinise/re-examine/standardise the

answer scripts/marks is ultra vires.

It is on these findings arrived at without jurisdiction that the

Dean reported to the Vice Chancellor that disciplinary action

against the Petitioner could be considered.

The Appeal Board did not look at the issue from the proper

perspective. The Appeal Board considered the appeal at a

superficial level and dismissed it paying scant attention to its

merits. The approach adopted is also wrong. I need not give so

many reasons to quash the punishment of the Council and the

decision of the Appeal Board.

If the first decision of the Departmental Higher Degrees

Committee and Faculty Higher Degrees Committee to appoint

examiners is ultra vires, it is a nullity for all intents and

21

purposes. There are no degrees of nullity. Everything that flows

from a decision which is a nullity also automatically becomes a

nullity without further ado, although Courts tend to make

formal orders quashing such subsequent decisions, rather

superfluously. Follow-up actions on void decisions can be

ignored with impunity.

Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [1961] 3 ALL ER

1169 at 1172 states:

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only

bad, but incurably bad. There is no need for an order of the

court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void.

Without more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to

have the court declare it to be so. And every proceeding

which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You

cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there.

It will collapse.

This passage was referred to with approval by G.P.S. de Silva J.

(later C.J.) in Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera [1982] 1 Sri Kantha

LR 164 at 168-169, Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) in Sirisena v.

Kobbekaduwa, Minister of Agriculture and Lands (1978) 80 NLR 1

at 182, and Sripavan J. (later C.J.) in Leelawathie v.

Commissioner of National Housing [2004] 3 Sri LR 175 at 178.

Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) in Sirisena v. Kobbekaduwa, Minister

of Agriculture and Lands (supra) at 182 quotes the following

portion of Hailsham (4th Edition) Vol. I, paragraph 27:

22

No legally recognised rights found on the assumption of its

validity should accrue to any person even before the act is

declared to be invalid or set aside in a Court of Law.

This principle was applied by the Supreme Court in the more

recent case of Padmal Ariyasiri Mendis v. Vijith Abraham de Silva

[2016] BLR 69 at 73 where it was held:

The deed No. 1551 is void ab initio and therefore the title

does not pass from the plaintiff to any other person.

Therefore deed which was executed thereafter, i.e. deed No.

976 is also void ab initio.

Wade supports this position in Administrative Law (9th Edition)

at page 280:

Where some act or order is invalid or void, the

consequences are followed out logically: consequential acts

are also invalid.

It is also noteworthy that an act can be challenged on the basis

of nullity, either directly or indirectly.

In Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera (supra) the University Services

Appeals Board came to the conclusion that the Petitioner in that

case should have been promoted as a Senior Lecturer according

to a Circular. However, the University Council did not carry out

the order of the Appeal Board. The Petitioner sought to compel

the Council by way of mandamus to carry out the Appeal Board

decision. It was shown before this Court that the Appeal Board

decision was void, as the Appeal Board did not have the

authority to make such a decision. This line of argument was

23

objected to on behalf of the Petitioner on the basis that the

Appeal Board decision cannot be so challenged collaterally. This

Court refused to accept the objection and cited Wade and De

Smith to fortify its position.

According to Wade, Administrative Law (11th Edition) at page

235, an act can be challenged on the basis of nullity, either

directly or indirectly, i.e. collaterally.

The validity of the act or order may be challenged directly,

as in proceedings for certiorari to quash it or for a

declaration that it is unlawful. But it may also be

challenged collaterally, as for example by way of defence to

a criminal charge, or by way of defence to a demand for

some payment.

De Smiths Judicial Review of Administrative Action (4th edition

by Professor Evans), at page 152 states:

Void acts and decisions are indeed usually destitute of

legal effect; they can be ignored with impunity; their validity

can be attacked, if necessary, in collateral (or indirect)

proceedings; they confer no legal rights on anybody.

I grant the petitioner all the reliefs prayed for in paragraphs (b)-

(h) of the prayer to the petition.

The 1st Respondent shall pay a sum of Rs. 100,000/= as costs to

the Petitioner.
