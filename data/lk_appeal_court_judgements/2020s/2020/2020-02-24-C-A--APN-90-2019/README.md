HON. JUSTICE ACHALA ~NGAPPULI

The Petitioner In this Revision Application seeks to

order made by the High Court of Negombo in Bail

555/2017 on 05.01.2018. In enlarging the 1st Suspect Petition

Koraralage Randeer Asiri Rodrigo on bail the High Court had iI11.]~~

following conditions:-

First he should furnish cash bail of Rs.lO, 000/- and se(:onid~~

provide Two sureties worth of Rs. 100,000/- surety bail. Thirdly

directed to report to the Organize Crime Prevention Division lucal~az:,

Mihindu Mawatha, Colombo 12 on all Sundays between 9.00 a.rn~i=

12 noon. He was restricted in his foreign travel and the

authorities were informed of the restriction.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that an application was

made to both the relevant Magistrate's Court as well as to the High Court

for variation of the third bail condition to report on every Sunday to the

said Organized Crime Prevention Division. However, his attempts to vary

the said condition were unsuccessful as the learned High Court Judge is

of the view that it should be the Magistrate's Court that should vary the

condition .

It appears that the Accused was concerned with an offence

committed under the Offensive Weapons Act. It is the High Court which

was conferred with jurisdiction to grant bail upon such an allegation

being leveled against the Accused. Therefore, when the High Court

granted bail in Bail Application No. 555/2017, it is the order of the High

Court and if there is a variation, it has to be done by the Court which

made the order in enlarging the Suspect/ or accused on bail.

Learned Senior State Counsel concedes to the application of the

Peti tioneL

This Court agrees with the submissions made by learned Counsel

for the Petitioner and varies the 3,d bail condition. Accordingly, the

4

Suspect -Petitioner Bastian Koraralage Randeer Asiri

report to the Organized Crime Prevention Division located

Mawatha, Colombo 12 on every last Sunday between 9

12.00 noon.

Application is allowed.

I agree.
