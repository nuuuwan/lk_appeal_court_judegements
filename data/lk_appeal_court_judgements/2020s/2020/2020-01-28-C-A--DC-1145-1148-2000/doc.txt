Janak De Silva J.

These are four appeals against the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of Kalutara

dated 14.11.2000.

The Plaintiff instituted the above styled action in the District Court of Kalutara seeking inter alia

to partition the land called 'Elabodamahawatta' situated in Moragalla containing in extent A.3-

R.2-P.0 morefully described in the Schedule to the Plaint dated 19.09.1980.

A commission was executed and the land sought to be partitioned is depicted in Preliminary Plan

No. 2523 dated 25.08.1981 made by U. M. De Silva, Licensed Surveyor as Lots A - F containing in

extent A.3-R.2-P.22.2. The Licensed Surveyor, in the Surveyor's Report dated 18.09.1981, has

identified the said Lots A - F of the said Preliminary Plan No. 2523 as the land to be partitioned.

The nnd Defendant filed her Statement of Claim on 02.10.1981 and sought to exclude Lots E and

F of the said Preliminary Plan No. 2523 from the land to be partitioned. Her contention was that

Page 27 of35

Website Copy Website Copy

\ '.

Lots E and F are formed by accretion from the sea. She accepted the pedigree of the Plaintiff with

regard to Lots A-D.

The 42nd -44th Defendants filed their Statement of Claim on 17.05.1982 and disputed the

pedigree produced by the Plaintiff.

The 45th Defendant also, by her Statement of Claim dated 30.03.1983, disputed the pedigree

produced by the Plaintiff.

Another commission was executed to survey and properly identify the land to be partitioned.

Accordingly, E. D. G. K. Premaratne, Licensed Surveyor prepared Preliminary Plan No. 2368 dated

18.12.1984, superimposing the said Preliminary Plan No. 2523, which depicts Lots A - F containing

in extent A.3-R.2-P.22.2. It is stated in the Surveyor's Report dated 18.11.1985 that the Plaintiff

seeks to partition Lots A - E whereas the 22nd and 25th Defendants seek to exclude Lots E and F

from the land to be partitioned. As per the said Surveyor's Report, the said Lots E and Fare

claimed by the 25th Defendant having being in possession for a period of twenty-seven (27) years.

The 22nd, 33rd - 40th Defendants filed their Statement of Claim on 23.06.1986 and sought to

exclude Lots E and F of the said Preliminary Plan No. 2523 and the said Preliminary Plan No. 2368

from the land to be partitioned. Under and by virtue of several deeds executed by the 22nd

Defendant, the 33rd - 40th Defendants claimed title to the said Lot F which is formed by accretion

from the sea and developed by the 22nd Defendant.

The 24th, 25th and 32nd Defendants filed their Statement of Claim on 23.06.1986 and disputed the

pedigree ofthe Plaintiff. They sought to exclude Lots E and F of the said Preliminary Plan No. 2523

and the said Preliminary Plan No. 2368 from the land to be partitioned. They further sought to

add one Hathadura Misilin Nona (later added as the 44th Defendant), who is the owner of the said

Lot E by prescription.

The 45th Defendant, by her Amended Statement of Claim dated 15.06.1988, disputed the

pedigree produced by the Plaintiff.

The 22nd, 33rd - 40th Defendants amended their Statement of Claim on 28.06. 1988 and sought a

commission to superimpose Fiscal Plan No. 29 dated 17.12.1884 made by C. I. De Zoysa, Licensed

Surveyor made for sale held under Writ No. 35960 in District Court of Kalutara.

As a result, a Plan bearing No. 2791 dated 27.08.1990 was prepared by E. D. G. K. Premaratne,

Licensed Surveyor which depicts Lots A, B, C1, C2, D1, D2, E and F containing in extent A.3-R.2-

P.22.2. It is stated in the Surveyor's Report dated 27.08.1990 that a tracing of Fiscal Plan No. 29

dated 17.12.1884 made by C. I. De Zoysa, Licensed Surveyor made for sale held under Writ No.

35960 was superimposed and the fixation is precise.

)

The 12th and 13th Defendants filed their Statement of Claim on 10.01.1990. The 14th - 16th and

47th - 50th Defendants filed their Statement of Claim on 28.08.1991. The 4th and 41" Defendants

filed their Statement of Claim on 30.09.1991. The 5th Defendant filed his Statement of Claim on

06.02.1992. The 2nd, 43,d and 44th Defendants filed their Statement of Claim on 20.07.1992. All

the aforementioned Defendants disputed the pedigree produced by the Plaintiff.

After a lengthy trial, the learned Additional District Judge entered judgment in favour of the

Plaintiff and decided that the said land should be partitioned in the manner laid down in the

Plaint. Being aggrieved, the 41't, 45A, 25th and 14th - 16th Defendants appealed.

In a partition case, it is incumbent on the Judge to investigate into title of each party before he

arrives at a determination [Chandrasena v. Piyasena and Others (1999) 3 SrLL.R. 201J and it is the

prime duty of the trial judge to carefully examine and investigate the actual rights and titles to

the land sought to be partitioned [Sapinana v. Pitipanaarachchi and Two Others (2010) 1 SrLL.R.

87J. Although there is a duty cast on the Court to investigate title in a partition action, the Court

can do so only within the limits of pleadings, admissions, points of contest, evidence both

documentary and oral. The Court cannot go on a voyage of discovery tracing the title and finding

the shares in the corpus for them [Thilagaratnam v. Athpunathan and Others (1996) 2 SrLL.R. 66J.

According to the Plaint, the original owner of the land called 'Elabodamahawatta' was Bodhi

Seeman Silva. It is said that after the demise of Bodhi Seeman Silva, the land devolved to his four

(04) children namely Menohamy, Dinoris, Myappu and Mendohamy. Menohamy's undivided Y.

share later devolved to her two (02) children namely David and Guneris (who got an undivided

1/8 share each). Their entitlements were sold to Pahalage Sadiris De Silva Abeygunawardena and

Singhara Pieris Silva at the sale held under Writ No. 35968 dated 25.02.1882.

By Deed of Transfer No. 3206 dated 06.05.1902 [Page 13 of the Appeal Brief (VoI.2)], the said

Pahalage Sadiris De Silva Abeygunawardena sold the undivided share he purchased at the sale

held under Writ No. 35968 dated 25.02.1882 to Tikkalage Myneris Silva, Tikkalage Barnis Silva,

Tikkalage Ideris Silva and Kekulahandi Eranorishamy. The Schedule of the said Deed of Transfer

No. 3206 describes the share entitlement of the said Pahalage Sadiris De Silva Abeygunawarden a

as " ... <e:!2)2Sl' qeC)25'i 6!lS) ~oCQi) (1/8) 2Zi ~w w,C)w!Sle625'i ~oCQi) (1/64) 2Zi ~(J) ... "

By Deed of Transfer No. 3326 dated 22.09.1902 [Page 166 of the Appeal Brief (VoI.2)], the said

Singhara Pieris Silva sold the undivided share he purchased at the sale held under Writ No. 35968

dated 25.02.1882 to Kerekola Arnolis De Silva. The Schedule ofthe said Deed ofTransfer No. 3326

describes the share entitlement of the said Singhara Pieris Silva as " ... <e:!2)2Sl' e~J~eD qeC)25'i

If what was sold at the sale held under Writ No. 35968 dated 25.02.1882 was the entitlement of

the said David and Guneris (i.e. an undivided 1/8 share each), a question arises as to how the said

Pahalage Sadiris De Silva Abeygunawardena and the said Singhara Pieris Silva became entitled to

an additional undivided 1/64 share and an additional undivided 1/40 share respectively which

were transferred by the said Deed of Transfer No. 3206 and the said Deed of Transfer No. 3326.

It is possible that the share entitlement of another co-owner was also sold at the sale held under

Writ No. 35968 dated 25.02.1882. However, it was never established by the evidence led.

Anyhow, under and by virtue of the said Deed of Transfer No. 3206, the said Tikkalage Myneris

Silva, Tikkalage Barnis Silva, Tikkalage Ideris Silva and Kekulahandi Eranorishamy became entitled

to an undivided 9/256 share each [(1/8+1/64) xl/4]. The said Kerekola Arnolis De Silva became

entitled to an undivided 3/20 share (1/8+1/40) under and by virtue of the said Deed of Transfer

No. 3326.

The undivided 3/20 share of Kerekola Arnolis De Silva was transferred to Sandradura Simonis de

Silva by Deed of Transfer No. 4363 dated 31.03.1909 [Page 170 of the Appeal Brief (VoI.2)].

Thereafter, the said Sandradura Simonis de Silva gifted it to Sandradura Carlina De Silva and

Anther De Zoysa Gunatilake by Deed bearing No.5 dated 22.01.1923 [Page 174 of the Appeal

Brief (VoI.2)]. By Deed of Transfer No. 1238 dated 13.02.1949 [Page 180 of the Appeal Brief

(VoI.2)], it was sold to Thenkutti Pabilis Silva. After his demise, the said undivided 3/20 share

devolved to his three (03) children namely Thenkutti Herbert Silva, Thenkutti Lissie Nona Silva

and Thenkutti Jayawathie Silva. They transferred it to the Original Plaintiff by Deed of Transfer

No. 8910 dated 20.05.1975 [Page 141 ofthe Appeal Brief (VoI.2)] and Deed ofTransfer No. 8792

dated 12.03.1975 [Page 146 of the Appeal Brief (VoI.2)].

The contents of the said Deeds of Transfer reveal that not only the entitlement Thenkutti Pabilis

Silva got from the Deed of Transfer No. 1238 dated 13.02.1949 but also the entitlements he got

from Deed bearing No. 40790 dated 30.05.1953 and Deed bearing No. 2154 dated 13.01.2154

together with his inheritance were transferred to the Original Plaintiff. The Deed bearing No.

40790 dated 30.05.1953 is not marked in evidence. However, a Deed of Transfer bearing No.

40792 dated 30.05.1953 was marked as '~l 36' [Page 274 of the Appeal Brief (VoI.2)] by which

Thenkutti Pabilis Silva became entitled to an undivided 1/32 share. There is a possibility that it

was mistakenly mentioned as "Deed No. 40790" in Deed ofTransfer No. 8910 dated 20.05.1975

and Deed of Transfer No. 8792 dated 12.03.1975. However, it was not clarified during the trial.

Page 30 of 35

Website Copy Website Copy

By Deed bearing No. 2154 dated 13.01.2154 [Page 235 of the Appeal Brief (VoI.2)L Thenkutti

Pabilis Silva became entitled to an undivided 1/32 share. If all the aforementioned undivided

shares were transferred to the Original Plaintiff by the heirs of Thenkutti Pabilis Silva, the share

entitlement of the Original Plaintiff would be an undivided 17/80 share [3/20+1/32+1/32].

However, this doesn't include the inheritance of Thenkutti Pabilis Silva which was not properly

established by the evidence led.

The 14th Defendant marked the Deed ofTransfer No. 1336 dated 20.06.1867 as '1451' [Page 115

of the Appeal Brief (VoI.2)] to establish the title of the 14th - 16th Defendants. The said Deed of

Transfer No. 1336 was executed by Unga Kammanthi Andiris Siva and Athadura Salonchihamy.

They have transferred an undivided 1/8 share of 'Mahawatta' [the boundaries and the extent

tally with 'Elabodamahawatta'] to Unga Kammanthi Thomis Silva and Unga Kammanthi Simanis

Silva. The contents of the said Deed ofTransfer No. 1336 reveal that the Transferors got their title

by inheritance. If so, the position taken up by the Plaintiff that the original owner of the entire

land was Bodhi Seeman Silva is incorrect.

The 4th, 14th - 16th and 41" - 44th Defendants accepted the entitlement of Unga Kammanthi

Andiris Siva and Athadura Salonchihamy in their Statements of Claim. The Substituted Plaintiff

also accepted the same during the trial [Page 442 of the Appeal Brief (VoI.1)]. Therefore, it is safe

to conclude that Unga Kammanthi Andiris Siva and Athadura Salonchihamy were the owners of

an undivided 1/8 share. In that event, the entitlement of Bodhi Seeman Silva is limited to an

undivided 7/8 share.

As mentioned earlier, Unga Kammanthi Thomis Silva and Unga Kammanthi Simanis Silva became

entitled to an undivided 1/8 share under and by virtue ofthe said Deed ofTransfer No. 1336 (i.e.

an undivided 1/16 share each). According to the 14th -16th Defendants, the undivided 1/16 share

of the said Unga Kammanthi Thomis Silva was sold to Pahalage Sadiris De Silva Abeygunawardena

by Deed of Transfer No. 9560 executed in 1877 [Page 260 of the Appeal Brief (VoI.1)]. And the

said entitlement of Pahalage Sadiris De Silva Abeygunawardena was sold at a Fiscal's sale (Writ

of Execution in Case No. 10371 in District Court of Kalutara) by Fiscal's Conveyance No. 10923

dated 05.01.1934 [Page 120 of the Appeal Brief (VoI.2)] to Anthonydura Suwanelhamy De Silva

Abeygunawardena.

The said Deed of Transfer No. 9560 was not marked in evidence. Also, a careful perusal of the

Fiscal's Conveyance No. 10923 dated 05.01.1934 reveals that Anthonydura Suwanelhamy De Silva

Abeygunawardena only became entitled to an undivided 1/20 share. In such circumstances, a

question arises as to what happened to the balance portion of the entitlement of Pahalage Sadiris

Page 31 of 3S

Website Copy Website Copy

De Silva Abeygunawardena, if Unga Kammanthi Thomis Silva conveyed his undivided 1/16 share

to him by the said Deed of Transfer No. 9560.

According to the 42nd - 44th Defendants, the undivided 1/16 share of Unga Kammanthi Simanis

Silva devolved to Unga Kammanthi Thomis Silva as the former died intestate and issueless. If that

is true, then Unga Kammanthi Thomis Silva was entitled to an undivided 1/8 share. The 42nd -

44th Defendants claim that the said undivided 1/8 share devolved to the heirs of Unga Kammanthi

Thomis Silva (Le. his two (02) children namely Abraham and Sinchappu).

However, according to the 14th - 16th Defendants, the undivided 1/16 share of Unga Kammanthi

Simanis Silva devolved to his three (03) children namely Samaris, Karolishamy and Amaris. If that

is the correct version, then Unga Kammanthi Thomis Silva was only entitled to an undivided 1/16

share. Since the devolution of the entitlements of Unga Kammanthi Thomis Silva and Unga

Kammanthi Simanis Silva are not properly established by evidence, their undivided 1/8 share

should be kept unallotted.

Even though how Pahalage Sadiris De Silva Abeygunawardena became entitled to an undivided

1/20 share remains a mystery, it is established that the said undivided 1/20 share was transferred

to Anthonydura Suwanelhamy De Silva Abeygunawardena by Fiscal's Conveyance No. 10923

dated 05.01.1934. And the 14th -16th Defendants claim her entitlement as her heirs.

The contention of the Plaintiff regarding the entitlement of Anthonydura Suwanelhamy De Silva

Abeygunawardena is that the Fiscal's Conveyance No. 10923 dated 05.01.1934 (1452) was

executed after the confirmation of sale in the Partition Case bearing No. 4814/P where the right

of Pahalage Sadiris De Silva Abeygunawardena was sold [Page 4 of the Written Submissions of

the Plaintiff-Respondent dated 27.05.2019] and that the 14th - 16th Defendants cannot rely on

'1452' as they have not led evidence to establish the nexus between Pahalage Sad iris De Silva

Abeygunawardena and the other parties to the said Partition Action. However, the endorsement

of the Registrar of District of Kalutara at the end of '145 2' states that it is a true copy of the

document marked '014' in Case No. 4814/P [Page 125 ofthe Appeal Brief (VoI.2)] . Therefore, it is

impossible that '1452' is a document executed after the confirmation of sale in the Partition Case

bearing No. 4814/P as urged by the Plaintiff.

In such circumstances, it is safe to conclude that under and by virtue of '1452', Anthonydura

Suwanelhamy De Silva Abeygunawardena became entitled to an undivided 1/20 share. The fact

that the 14th -16th Defendants are the only heirs of her is not disputed. Therefore, the 14th -16th

Defendants are entitled to an undivided 1/60 share each. However, the learned Additional District

Page 32 of35

Website Copy Website Copy

Judge has only allotted 0.06944444% share each to the 14th - 16th Defendants whereas they are

actually entitled to an undivided 1.6666666% share each.

By Deed of Dowry No. 2872 dated 24.01.1881, the widow (namely Edonishamy) and the son

(namely Sandradurage Nandappu Silva) of Sandradurage Dines Silva conveyed an undivided 1/16

share and an undivided 1/48 share to Sandradurage Saraneris Silva and Sandradurage

Pensohamy. However, according to the Plaint, Dines Silva was entitled to an undivided 1/8 share

by inheritance and that is what was later transferred to Sandradurage Saraneris Silva and

Sandradurage Pensohamy. The contents of the Deed of Dowry No. 2872 dated 24.01.1881 is

contradictory to what is stated in the Plaint.

Sandradurage Saraneris Silva and Sandradurage Pensohamy transferred the entitlement they got

from the Deed of Dowry No. 2872 and another undivided 1/20 share Sandradurage Pensohamy

got as maternal inheritance to Pohaddara Jayaneris by Deed of Transfer No. 6417 dated

24.10.1907. It is clear by the contents of the said Deed of Transfer No. 6417 that the additional

undivided 1/20 share originally belonged to Edonishamy. Also, if Sandradurage Pensohamy got

as maternal inheritance an undivided 1/20 share, there is a possibility that the son of Edonishamy

(i.e. Sandradurage Nandappu Silva) also got an equal share. In such circumstances, at the time of

Edonishamy's death, her entitlement was an undivided 1/10 share. She might have got entitled

to such share through her deceased husband (i.e. Sandradurage Dines Silva) or through someone

else. However, there is no evidence at all to come to a conclusion. If her share entitlement came

through Sandradurage Dines Silva, there is a possibility that he was entitled to a much larger share

than an undivided 1/8 share as stated in the Plaintiff.

Anyhow, by Deed of Transfer No. 6417 dated 24.10.1907, Pohaddara Jayaneris became entitled

to an undivided 2/15 share [1/16+1/48+1/20j. He also became entitled to another undivided 1/20

share under and by virtue of Deed ofTransfer No. 504 dated 08.11.1913. Accordingly, Pohaddara

Jayaneris was entitled to an undivided 11/60 share.

According to the evidence of the 41st Defendant, the share entitlement of Pohaddara Jayaneris

was conveyed to Pohaddara Sathinhamy De Silva by Deed ofTransfer No. 1109 dated 27.07.1925.

The said Deed of Transfer was not produced. However, the document marked '~( 15 ' states that

the duplicate kept at the Land Registry is decayed. Pohaddara Sathinhamy De Silva transferred

the entitlement she got from the said Deed of Transfer No. 1109 to Muthuwahandi Similiya De

Silva by the Conditional Transfer No. 3135 dated 12.02.1959 [Page 194 of the Appeal Brief

(VoI.2)j. According to the Schedule of the said Conditional Transfer No. 3135, what is transferred

is an undivided 71/205 share. A question arises as to how Pohaddara Sathinhamy De Silva became

Page 33 of35

Website Copy Website Copy

entitled to a larger portion than what Pohaddara Jayaneris had. Anyhow, the title deeds show

that the said undivided 71/205 share devolved to the 41st Defendant along with another

undivided 1/32 share.

By virtue of a Writ issued from the District Court of Kalutara Case No. 12211 dated 01.09.1926,

an undivided 1/16 share belonging to Sandradura Fredrick De Silva was sold to Elaris De Silva

Abeygunawardena and Muthwahandi Kuin Nona De Silva Abeygunawardena by After their

demise, the Fiscal's Conveyance No. 11244 dated 28.09.1935 was executed and their four (04)

heirs namely Nayanawathie, Amarawathie, Allen Ferry and Ramyawathie became entitled to the

said undivided 1/16 share [Page 35 of the Appeal Brief (VoL2)). They executed the Deed of

Exchange No. 3478 dated 23.08.1959 by which the said Nayanawathie De Silva Abeygunawardena

(who is the 45th Defendant in the instant action) became entitled to the said undivided 1/16 share.

The contention of the Plaintiff in this regard is that what was sold at the Fiscal's sale held by virtue

ofthe Writ of Execution in Case No. 12211 is a different land called "Mahawatta alias Wellawatta"

and that the boundaries do not tally. However, as I observed earlier, in the Deed of Transfer No.

1336 dated 20.06.1867, the land was referred to as "Mahawatta".

It must be noted that in the Fiscal's Conveyance No. 11244 dated 28.09.1935 the north boundary

is described as "Pelawatta alias the land wherein Kiriappu resided". The said discrepancy is

explained in the said the Deed of Exchange No. 3478 dated 23.08.1959 in which the north

boundary is described as "~lCel~2Sl ewel~ l!5qog ~~ o tl el SCl .yel ( ~~(J)J el~2Sl )".

In view of the above, it is clear that the 45th Defendant became entitled to an undivided 1/16

share. However, the learned Additional District Judge has failed to allot any shares to the 45th

Defendant.

Kekulahandi Koleris Silva became entitled to an undivided 1/96 share by Deed of No. 7555 dated

15.05.1913 [Page 241 of the Appeal Brief (VoL2)).

Tikkalage Ornis Silva transferred the undivided 1/16 share belonged to him by virtue of the Writ

of Execution No. 34386 to Tikkalage Myneris Silva, Tikkalage Barnis Silva, Tikkalage Ideris Silva,

Tikkalage Coranerishamy, Tikkalage Guneris and Kekulahandi Eranorishamy by Deed of Transfer

No. 3824 dated 09.11.1904 [Page 10 ofthe Appeal Brief (VoL2)).

However, there is no cogent evidence as to how the said share entitlements devolved.

In Maddumaralalage Dana Mary Nana v. Maddumaralalage Dan Justin and Others (2016 BLR

130), Eva Wanasundera, P. c., J. held as follows-

"In a partition actian, the Judge has to decide what share of the land shauld be allatted ta

which party. It is different from answering issues in a money recavery case, a divorce case,

a rent and ejectment case, a land dispute case, a debt recavery case, a case based on

can tract or a case based on delict etc. In those cases, the answers could be in the

affirmative or in the negative, may be with some comment or a remark which would show

the inclination to the final decision. But in a partition action, each party claims different

portions of one big land and the Judge is expected to sort out what share of the land should

be granted to which plaintiff and/or defendant. For this reason, I find that the onus of the

Judge in a partition case is somewhat more difficult than in any other kind of case, since

the Judge has to specifically calculate the share of entitlement." [emphasis added].

As I observed earlier, the Plaintiff has failed to properly establish his entitlement to the land to

be partitioned and that the chain of title laid down in the Plaint of the Plaintiff is broken. In such

circumstances, I hold that the learned Additional District Judge has erred in entering a judgment

in favour of the Plaintiff and accepting the pedigree of the Plaintiff without calculating the share

entitlement of each party.

In an appeal in a partition action, if it appears to the Court of Appeal that the investigation of title

has been defective, it should set aside the decree and make an order for proper investigation

[Mohamedaly Adamjee and Others v. Hadad Sadeen and Others (58 N.L.R. 217)].

For all the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge of

Kalutara dated 14.11.2000. I make further order that a trial de novo be held expeditiously and

the learned Additional District Judge is directed to take all reasonable steps to conclude the trial

early.

Appeals are allowed to the extent specified above. Parties shall bear their costs.
