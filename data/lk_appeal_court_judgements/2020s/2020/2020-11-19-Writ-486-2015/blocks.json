The Selection Committee took its decision on 5th January 2011 - vide R6, and the Petitioner complained to the Human Rights Commission on 14th February 2011 vide P5. As I have already observed, that complaint was limited to the allegation that the 21st Respondent prevented him from attaching Section 1.6 of his application.

Thus, the fact that his application had been processed and that he had not secured sufficient marks for Section 1 was known to the Petitioner by the latter part of March 2011. The fact that the Petitioner had received the above letter is clear when one considers that he had tendered the said letter to the University Services Appeals Board. What is significant is that having been informed that he had not received sufficient marks for Section 1, the Petitioner did not request the 1st Respondent University to provide him with a detailed breakdown of the marks, nor did the Petitioner challenge the said decision at that time. Having examined the Written Submissions dated 9th December 2012 marked P9 tendered by the 21st Respondent to the Human Rights Commission, I observe that the report of the Senate Appointed Panel, containing the detailed marks given for Sections 1 and 3.2 has been annexed (vide 1j.2).

The response of the Petitioner, as set out in paragraphs 8.3 8.8 of the written submissions tendered on 2nd October 2020 was that the Petitioner became aware for the first time that his application was rejected for not securing sufficient marks for the promotion only upon receiving P17 on 26th August 2015, and hence, there has not been any delay. The contents of the letter dated 21st March 2011 and P9, and the Petitioners own admissions in P5a, P6 and P12, all of which I have already adverted to, makes it abundantly clear that there has been a long delay on the part of the Petitioner in invoking the jurisdiction of this Court. This application is accordingly liable to be dismissed on the ground of delay, alone. Although none of the Respondents have raised it, there is one other issue that I must advert to. It has been consistently held by the Supreme Court of this country that a litigant must come before Court with clean hands. When I consider the letter dated 11th August 2015 marked P16 sent on behalf of the Petitioner calling upon the 1st Respondent to communicate the final decision of the Selection Committee, in the light of the aforementioned material referred to in the preceding paragraphs, it is clear to me that P16 was a ruse adopted by the Petitioner to elicit a reply from the 1st Respondent, thereby enabling the Petitioner to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court without having to face an objection that he is guilty of laches. In the above circumstances, I see no legal basis to grant the relief prayed for by the Petitioner. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.",
