ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted by the Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery and Corruption for committing an offence under Section 23(A)(3) of the

Bribery Act.

Trial against the Appellant commenced in March 1998 and after four

applications for trial de novo, with each succession of trial Judges interspersed

with his repeated applications to postpone the trial, it had finally reached

conclusion with the pronouncement of the impugned judgment in March 2007.

The Appellant was convicted by the judgment of the High Court and

sentenced to a four-year term of imprisonment. He was imposed a fine of

Rs.2500.00, in addition to the fine of Rs. 1,200,000.00 imposed under Section 26A

2

of the Bribery Act. In default of the said fine a five-year term of imprisonment,

was imposed by the trial Court and made operative consecutive to the four-year

term of imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant

appealed to this Court, invoking its appellate jurisdiction, to have them set aside.

At the hearing of his appeal, learned President's Counsel for the Appellant

submitted that the trial Court had unfairly entered a conviction as it rejected the

defence position on the basis that his wife's income was not acceptable to it since

it had no documentary support. It was his contention that the trial Court

reached the said conclusion on its failure to note that this was primarily due to

the failure of the Commission to properly investigate that aspect of the known

income of the Appellant. In addition, learned President's Counsel also relied on

instances where the trial Court allegedly made errors in relation to the

prosecution evidence, in arriving at a finding to the detriment of the Appellant.

The Appellant was employed as a Customs officer and it is alleged in the

indictment that the properties that are listed out could not have been properly

acquired during the period 31.03.1990 to 31.07.1992, with any part of his known

income.

During the trial, the prosecution primarily relied on the evidence of David

Singho, the officer who was tasked to carry out an investigation on the income

and expenditure of the Appellant.

At the commencement of the trial de novo for the fourth time, the

prosecution and the Appellant marked several admissions before the trial Court

under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, by

3

which the parties considered that certain acquisitions of property of the

Appellant were admitted as proved. A brief description of these admissions are

as follows:-

a. acquisition of property (Gonahena Estate) for Rs. 207,000.00

b. acquisition of property (Gonahena) for Rs.77,250.00

c. acquisition of property (Galabada Estate) for Rs.51,5oo.00

d. construction of a dwelling house in Galabada Estate at the cost of Rs.

200,000.00

e. acquisition of paddy land for Rs. 41,200.00

f. acquisition of land for Rs. 498,200.00

g. acquisition of land for Rs.248,600.oo

h. acquisition of land (Puwakwatta) for Rs. 51,500.00

1. repair cost of Weliveriya house at Rs.40,000.00

j. balance in the Sarnpath Bank Kiribathgoda account at Rs.316,528.89

k. balance in the Sampath Bank Kiribathgoda another account at

Rs.140,211.30

I. balance in the Rural Bank Weliveriya of Rs.163,114.26

m. acquisition of four plots of land for Rs. 414,348.80

n. acquisition of a motor cycle for Rs.36,000.00

o. acquisition of a motor car for Rs.230,000.00

p. investment of Rs. 5000.00 on Singhe Enterprises

q. loan of Rs. 500,000.00

r. income from Coconut Estate Rs. 28,000.00

The Appellant gave evidence before the trial Court and sought to explain

that the investigators have failed to allow certain other income in his favour

4

before instituting the instant prosecution for the excess amount of Rs.620,OOO.00

in excess of his known income.

One such instance is the income of his wife derived from her self-

employment. He quantifies her income from plant sales, Cake baking and money

lending at Rs. 150,000.00 for the relevant period.

According to the Appellant's evidence before the trial Court, he had

received an income of Rs. 324,000.00 for the nine- month period from his coconut

Estate since its acquisition, an amount which had not been included into his

known income, although he opted to declare only Rs. 28,000.00 to the

Commission as his income from the said Estate. His explanation for making an

understatement to the Commission in Form 5, as to his actual income from the

Estate, was, in order to avoid having problems with the Inland Revenue.

It is also alleged by the Appellant that the total payments he had received

from the Customs as rewards are not included to his known income.

The trial Court, in its judgment had determined the total expenses of the

Appellant during the relevant period (including the expenses that are incurred in

acquisitions of properties) at Rs. 2,632,533.54, upon his admissions and on

documentary proof and his known income at Rs. 2,013,108.62. In the impugned

judgment, the trial Court had concluded that the Appellant had therefore

overspent Rs. 619,425.00, during the relevant period above his known income.

Turning to the primary ground of appeal that there were no investigations

conducted as to the veracity of the Appellant's claim of income from his wife's

self-employment, the trial Court in its impugned judgment had considered this

aspect in detail. It refers to the statement recorded from the Appellant's wife

5

where she had stated that she earns an income about Rs.4000.00 a month from

her self-employment. The Court also considered the Appellant's position that

had been suggested to the investigating officer David Singho, where the

Appellant took up the position that she received about Rs. 2000.00 a month. In

order to assess the truthfulness of these conflicting claims, the trial Court had

considered the declaration of assets and liabilities of the Appellant for the year

1990, where he had stated that she had Rs. 75,000.00 in her possession which he

himself had given to her for safe keeping. No mention of her income from cakes

or any of her earning was made. The Appellant had accounted for that amount

of money in her possession consisting of his rewards, in addition to her

unspecified earnings.

The basis on which the trial Court had rejected the Appellant's claim that

his wife earned about Rs. 150,000.00 from her self-employment is based on

application of tests of consistency and probability. It had noted that no such

claim was made in the said declaration of his assets and liabilities and there was

no documentary proof to substantiate such a claim made before the trial Court.

During cross-examination, the Appellant admitted that it is his wife who

knows the income from her self-employment and he is unable to recollect that it

was suggested by him to the prosecution witness that she received Rs. 400,000.00

annually from her self -employment. The Appellant conceded that his wife paid

income tax for her share in Singhe Enterprises and she had not declared her self-

employment to the Inland Revenue Department. He also stated that since he

was not involved with her self-employment, he is not in a position to elaborate

on her income and unable to recollect the amount she stated as her income in her

statement. He denied that he ever accused the prosecution of not including his

6

wife's income to his known income and confines his complaint that there was no

proper investigation. He had no answer to offer when questioned as to the exact

amount she had earned. Neither he nor his wife did ever maintain any accounts

on her self- employment.

Thus, this Court is of the view that the conclusion reached by the trial

Court over the claim of self-employment is based on the proper appreciation and

assessment of the evidence that had been presented before it by the prosecution

and the Appellant.

Learned President's Counsel, during his submissions had referred to the

evidence in relation to the cash rewards of the Appellant and invited attention of

this Court that the prosecution witness admitted that some of these amounts are

not included in the document P20 the Customs had issued to the investigators.

The Chief Accountant of Sri Lanka Customs was called by the prosecution

to produce document P20, which included the total amount the Appellant had

received including cash rewards as per the records maintained at his office. It is

stated that the said amounts have calculated on the available documents. When

cross examined by the Appellant, the witness claimed he is unaware of any cash

reward that had not been included in the document P20. The witness denied any

knowledge when it was suggested to him that all rewards received by the

Appellant are not included in P20. He conceded that P20 had no reference to

payment of an incentive but clarified the non inclusion of the said allowance on

the basis that, to his knowledge, such incentives were paid only from 1994.

It is interesting to note that the Appellant claimed that he received over Rs.

2 Million as rewards, but P20 refers only to Rs.493,521.40 and no suggestion was

7

put to the Chief Accountant that he received incentive allowance over Rs. 1.5

Million during the relevant period.

The trial Court had considered all these aspects in relation to the

evaluation of the truthfulness of his assertion and arrived at the conclusion that

such a claim is unfounded.

It is appropriate at this stage of the judgment, to consider the burden of

proof of the prosecution as well as the Appellant, in view of the deeming

provision contained in Section 23A of the Bribery Act, since the prosecution was

based on the said Section.

In Fernando v Republic of Sri Lanka 79 II NLR 313, the then Supreme

Court considered the applicable provisions in relation to prosecutions under

Section 23A of the Bribery Act and related statutory provisions in relation to what

is generally known as 'asset inquiries'. It is stated that;

'The law which creates the offence is subsection 3 to section 23A. A

person who owns property which is deemed to be property, (a)

which he has acquired by bribery or (b) to which he has converted

property acquired by bribery is guilty of an offence. Section 90

defines what bribery is. The prosecution then has to prove, beyond

reasonable doubt, that the appellant owned such property.

Subsection 1 to section 23A states what is deemed to be property

acquired by bribery. Where it is shown that a person to whom the

section applies has acquired property, within the requisite period,

movable or immovable and it is shown that he could not have

8

acquired such property from his known income or known receipts or

it is shown that it is not property to which any part of his known

receipts has been converted that property is deemed to be property

(a) acquired from bribery or (b) to which he has converted property

acquired from bribery and that person who owns such property is

guilty of an offence under section 23A(3) of the Act. The offence

then depends on the legal presumption. But that legal presumption

will apply to the property and will only last" until the contrary is

proved by him." The legislature has clearly stated by whom "the

contrary" is to be proved. It is not by the prosecution. It is by

"him", that is the person who owns or has acquired such property.

He knows best how he acquired it. It is within his special

knowledge. Consequently, he is in a position to show that it was not

acquired from bribery. What is it that" he" has to prove or, as the

learned trial Judge stated, contrary of what ? Contrary of" that

such property is property acquired by him by bribery." He has to

prove that the property was not acquired from income or receipts

from bribery, i.e., the property was not acquired from any

gratification accepted in contravention of Part II of the Bribery

Act. "

When the parties made admissions and the prosecution presented

documentary proof of income and expenditure it had disclosed its burden

sufficiently.

It appears that the primary ground of appeal of the Appellant that there

was no proper investigation carried out by the Commission in relation to his

known income was made based on the reasoning of the judgment of

9

Kekulandara v Director General, Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery and Corruption(2006) 3 Sri L.R. 90, where this Court stated;

U In this case the prosecution admitted that they were aware of some

unascertained income received by the accused. The Commission got

this information from the Department of Agrarian Services where

the accused was employed. The Agrarian Service Department

informed the Commission that the information with regard to this

income has to be obtained by the Bank which made payments to the

accused. The Commission never made inquiries from the Bank with

regard to these payments. The Commission did not inquire from the

accused either particularly with regard to these receipts. Then can

one say that the charges were brought after a thorough

investigation? The prosecution is not expected to conduct an

incomplete investigation and get the accused to prove his innocence.

There is no evidence in this case that the accused did not corporate

with regard to the investigation. U

In relation to the instant appeal, this reasoning could not be adopted

since the factual situation is quite different. In this instant appeal, the

investigators have verified all verifiable claims of the Appellant. In relation to

his claim of self-employment, the Appellant himself concedes that no records

were available. The fact that his wife baked cakes and sold flower plants and

received over Rs. 150,000.00 when the Appellant had received only Rs.63,169.05

as his salary for the same period, if accepted as credible, indicate the scale of her

industry and therefore it is reasonable to expect some documentation at least to

10

confirm the purchases of raw material. But neither the Appellant nor his wife

provided any details where the Commission could focus its attention in

verifying this claim.

This is clearly not a situation where" the prosecution admitted that they were

aware of some unascertained income" which could have been easily verified. The

Appellant's as well as his wife's claim of income from self-employment

remained a mere verbal assertion, and in the absence of any proof, its

acceptance depends on the credibility of the witness who asserts of such a

claim.

In relation to claim that the incentives were not added to the known

income, the Appellant did not counter the accountant's position that such an

allowance was in fact paid during the relevant period.

At the most, the Appellant's position of income from self-employment

might suffice to raise a doubt as to whether these claims could have been

acceptable. But that is not what is expected from the Appellant, in a prosecution

under Section 23A of the Bribery Act. In Fernando v Republic of Sri Lanka

(supra) the Supreme Court had endorsed the approach taken by the trial Court

as it states;

" it is evident that what the trial Judge meant was that the

appellant must prove that from the sources he did not receive

gratifications. He stated immediately afterwards. The quantum of

proof in discharging that presumption is no doubt on a balance of

probability. There is a duty cast on the Court not merely to examine

the sources of income but also to examine the character of each

11

payment, and it is not enough for the accused to leave a doubt in the

mind of the Court, because leaving a doubt alone will not be

sufficient. Here there is no doubt that the trial Judge had the case of

Jayasena, 72 N.L.R. 313, in mind. This is, with respect, a correct

statement of the burden that lay on the appellant and that is the

yardstick applied by the trial Judge in determining whether the

presumption has been rebutted. When the learned trial Judge said in

the second instance that the appellant 'has to prove these

transactions are free from taint and that the character of these

payments are above suspicion' he meant nothing other than to say

that 'leaving a doubt alone will not be sufficient' as in the first

passage."

The complaint of factual error committed by the trial Court is limited to

P20 when the trial Court stated that several documents including P20 were

"admitted" by the parties. The document, indicating the total income received

from Sri Lanka Customs by the Appellant, was marked through David Singho and

Accountant, Suriya Kumara. The position of the Appellant in relation to P20 is that

it did not include the incentives. But the witness Suriya Kumara refuted that

position. The other allowance that had been received by the Appellant ( Q)J6)o

oOCW@)!) G)JOCll) was taken into consideration by the trial Court as it noted that he

had received Rs. 8632.00 as that allowance. The trial Court noted that on

05.03.1998, the Appellant admitted the contents of P20, referred to as item 20 in

page 8 of the impugned judgment. P20 was not among the documents that are

admitted by the Appellant.

12

Even if there is an error of fact in relation to admission of P20 it had not

resulted any prejudice since what the Appellant contended was that it should

have indicated a higher value. The trial Court was mindful of this issue, which it

had considered and rejected. Clearly this ground of appeal is bereft of any merit.

Therefore, this Court is of the view that there is no merit in the appeal of

the Appellant. The conviction of the Appellant is accordingly affirmed by this

Court.

However, this Court notes that the Appellant was imposed a four-year

term of imprisonment and a default term of five years of imprisonment, if he fails

to pay the Rs. 1,200,000.00 fine. The Court further ordered that the default term of

imprisonment be consecutive to the four-year term of imprisonment.

The Appellant was accused of committing the offence in 1990-1992, almost

four decades ago. As noted by this Court at the very commencement of this

judgment, the extraordinary delay was mostly due to the Appellant's own

contributions by seeking postponements. The Appellant had accumulated wealth

by resorting to bribery and being a Customs officer, he would have deprived the

Government of its due revenue by helping out the bribe givers in his official

capacity. This is clearly an aggravating circumstance that warranted imposition

of a custodial sentence and the trial Court was correct to impose such a sentence.

Nonetheless, in consideration of the Appellant's age as being 67 years at

present , this Court is of the view that the deterrent effect of the sentence of

imprisonment had reduced over time and therefore would not serve its purpose

anymore. This Court therefore reduces the said sentence by substituting the

same with a two-year term of imprisonment, suspended for a period of ten years.

13

The imposition of the fine of Rs. 1,200,000.00 by the trial Court is affirmed

by this Court. But the default term of five years imposed by the trial Court was in

conflict with the statutory provisions contained in Section 291(I)(d) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 and therefore is reduced to 18 months of

imprisonment.

Subject to the above variations in the sentence, the Appeal of the Appellant

is dismissed.

The High Court is directed to comply with the provisions of Section 303(4).
