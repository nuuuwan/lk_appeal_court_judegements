Argued on : 02103/2020

Judgment on : 03/07/2020

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) filed

an application before the Provincial High Court of the Central Province holden in

Nuwara-Eliya against the Respondent-Appellants, Hatton-Dickoya Urban Council

as 1

51 Respondent-Appellant, (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) seeking

writs in the nature of writ of certiorari and prohibition to quash the decisions

reflected in letters marked "P9" and "PIO", dated 08/11/2013 (Vide page 167 of

the brief) and 2111 112013, (Vide page 168 of the brief) respectively, on the basis

of illegality and that the said decisions have adversely affected the rights of the

Page 4 of 15

Respondent. By the impugned letters marked "P9" and "PlO", the 1 5t Appellant

Council restrained the Respondent from undertaking further development activity

in the land marked lot Nd. 18, in temis of Section 8A (I), of the Urban

Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 (as amended), (referred to as the

UDAAct).

The Appellants contended that the impugned letters were dispatched by the

Council in the exercise of power within the province by the 15t Appellant Council,

in terms of the UDA Act.

The learned High Court Judge by order dated 10/0912014, granted relief to

the Petitioner-Respondent as prayed for. Before this Court, the Appellants raised a

preliminary objection to the application filed before the High Court on the basis

that the Hatton-Dickoya Urban Council area has been declared as an "Urban

Development area" in terms of Section 3 of the Act and therefore, the Respondent

cannot invoke writ jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court. Section 3 of the UDA

Act deals with the declaration of areas as "Urban Development" areas by order of

the Minister and the effect of such order. The impugned letters have been sent to

the Respondent in the context that the land has been declared as an "Urban

Development" area in terms of the said Act.

According to Article 154P (4) of the Constitution,

"Every High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue, according to law-

Page 5 of 15

b) Order in the nature of writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, Procedendo,

Mandamus and Quo warranto against any person exercising, within the

Province, any power under

i. any law; or

ll. any statutes made by the Provincial Council established for that

Province, in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List. "

Referring to the words "any law" in Article 154P (4) (b) (i), the Supreme

Court in Weragama v. Eksath Lanka Kamkaru Samithiya (1994) 1 SLR 293 at

page 294, held that;

"the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is not an entrenched jurisdiction because

Article 138 provides that it is subject to the provisions "of any law ". Hence it was

always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to be reduced or

transferred by ordinary law. "

Therefore, the l3 th Amendment to the Constitution conferred a parallel

jurisdiction (subject to the restrictions set out in Article 154 (4) (a) and (b)) on the

Provincial High Courts to issue the above-mentioned writs.

Furthermore, the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No.

19 of 1990 provides in Section 7 that "The Provisions of written law applicable to

applications to the Court of Appeal invoking the jurisdiction vested in that Court

by Articles 140 and 141 of the Constitution shall Mutatis Mutandis, apply to

applications made to a High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution

, Page 6 of 15

invoking the jurisdiction vested in thQl Court by paragraph (4) of Article 154 of

the Constitution: !'

The above provisions of the law make~ it absolutely clear that any law or

any statute applicable to the exercise of writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal are

applicable to the exercise of writ jurisdiction by the Provincial High Courts,

however, is subject to the restrictions set out in Article l54P (4) (a) and (b) of the

Constitution.

In Weragama v. Eksath Lanka Kamkaru Samithiya (supra), it was also

held that,

"if a law or statute is covered by a matter in the (exclusive) Provincial Council

List, but not otherwise, the exercise of powers there under is subject to the writ

jurisdiction of the High Court. "

Therefore "any law" referred to above is referable to any law passed by

parliament pertaining to any matter set out in the Provincial Council List.

There is a limitation on the issue of granting writs by the Provincial High

Court as set out in Article 154P (4) of the constitution. They could only be issued

against any person who exercises any power under any law or provincial statute on

a subject set out in the Provincial Council List. Therefore the writ jurisdiction of

the High Court is limited to matters falling under the Provincial Council List.

Page 7 of 15

Accordingly, the question to be determined is whether the High Court of

the province has the jurisdiction to issue orders in the nature of writs of certiorari

and prohibition against the Appellant Council exercising power within the

province delegated to the said Council, in terms of the Urban Development

Authority Law.

The Appellant Council entered into a Lease Agreement No. 4179 dated 29th

October 2013 (vide page 80 of the brief) with the Respondent. The operative

article of the deed reveals that Hatton-Dickoya Urban Council is the owner of the

said land, states thus,

"whereas the Council is the owner and is seized and possessed of all that land and

. " premises .....

The land marked "Lot 18" is within the area declared as a development area

under Gazette Notification (marked as "m" vide page 94 of the brief) No. 100/4,

dated 04/08/1980, by the Minister, ill terms of Section 3 of the Urban

Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 (as amended). In terms of the

document marked "e)2", (vide page I 00 of the brief) the Urban Development

Authority (UDA) has delegated its powers under Section 23(5) of the Urban

Development Authority Law (as amended) to the Hatton-Dickoya Urban Council

to perform their duties under the direction, supervision and control of the UDA.

Section 36 (e) of Urban Councils Ordinance No. 61 of 1939 (as amended)

reads, thus;

Page 8 of 15

i. to sell, exchange, let Or give out on lease any land or building belonging to

the Council or vested in it otherwise than by virtue o/the provisions 0/

section 32 or section 34, subject to the terms and conditions o/the

instrument by which the land or building was trans/erred to or vested in the

Council, unless the sale, exchange, letting or leasing is prohibited by such

instrument ;

ll. to let or give out on lease any land or building vested in it by virtue o/the

provisions 0/ section 32 or section 34 and not required lor any public

purpose lor the time being, subject, however, to the prior approval o/the

Minister and subject always to such terms and conditions as may be set out

in the vesting order, certificate or recon issued or made under section 33,

or the will, or the deed or instrument 0/ gift or trust executed by the donor,

in respect 0/ such land or building ;

Accordingly, it is clearly established that the land, morefully described as a

development area in terms of Section 3 of the UDA Law is situated within the

limits of the Urban Council and the land has right title and interest in the Hatton-

Dickoya Urban Council and therefore comes within the purview of Section 32 of

the Urban Councils Ordinance.

It is also to be noted that in Madduma Banda Vs. Assistant Commissioner

0/ Agrarian Services and Another, (2003) 2 SLR 80 Bandaranayake J. (as was

she then) observed thus;

Page 9 of 15

"in case of ambiguity, the enactment should be interpreted so as to give effect to

its purpose. The purpose of the 13th Amendment is to give a right to an aggrieved

party to have recourse to the Provincial High Court instead of having to seek

relief from the Court of Appeal in Colombo. As such the High Court is deemed to

have jurisdiction to grant writ sought under Article 154P (4). "

In the circumstances, I hold that in the instant application, the High Court

of the province has jurisdiction to issue orders in the nature of writs by virtue of

the power given to them in terms of Article 154P (4) of the Constitution.

Therefore, the preliminary objection raised by the Appellant is dismissed.

Apart from the preliminary objection, both parties were heard on the

impugned documents marked "P9" and "P I 0". The position of the Respondent is

that the Council approved the said building plan bearing No. BA 7112009 to

construct a building, subject to the terms and conditions therein. According to

document marked "P6a", dated 29/04/2013, (Vide page ISS of the brief) the

building application has been approved subject to the condition that the

Respondent enter into a Lease Agreement with the I st Appellant Council in order

to proceed with the building construction in Lot No.18. The Respondent also

submits that on written instructions given by the Appellant to lease the land to the

Respondent as reflected in document marked "P7a", dated 25/09/2013, (Vide page

159 of the brief) a monthly lease rental was paid in respect of the said land.

However, due to objections raised by 5 Council members, by letter marked "P9",

Page 10 of 15

the Respondent was informed to halt all construction work by 0811112013. By

letter marked "PIO", the Respondent was notified that the Respondent had

undertaken the construction without a valid approval and! or in violation of the

terms of the permit, and requested the Respondent to produce the lease agreement,

deeds, building application to the 1st Appellant Council on the 2511112013. By

letter marked "PI I", dated 03/0112014, (Vide page 169 of the brief) the

Respondent in writing opposed the request by citing previous approval given to

him to proceed with the construction of the building. The Appellants have failed to

reply the said letter.

In Thirimavavithana Vs. Urban Development Authority and Others,

(2010) 2 SLR 262 Sisira De A brew, J. held that,

"If a public authority decides to act contrary to its published policy or decisions

to frustrate Legitimate Expectation created among the individuals by way of

promise or undertaking oSuch decisions, unless there is an overriding public

interest are liable to be quashed by way of Writ of Certiorari. "

Justice Sisira De Abrew cited with approval the case of,

"Regina Vs. Hull University Ex Parte (1993) AC 682 at 701 (House Lords)

where Lord Brown Wilikinson observed thus: The fundamental principle (Of

judicial review) is that courts will intervene to ensure that the powers of public

decision-making bodies are exercised lawfully. In all cases .... This intervention by

way of prohibition or certiorari is based on the proposition that such powers have

Page 11 of 15

been conferred on the decision maker on the underlying assumption that the

powers are to be exercised only within the jurisdiction conferred, in accordance

with the fair procedures .... "

"The provisions contained in Section 2BA (3) falls within the scope of the term

"planning" and therefore the powers, duties and functions referred to therein can

be delegated by the Urban Development Authority to any officer of the local

authority" (Perera, Municipal Commissioner Vs. Selvam (2012) BLR 58).

In the above context, it is important to note that the Appellants have entered

into a Lease Agreement No. 4179, therein the Respondent has deposited a sum in

excess of Rs. 10,0001- with the Appellant Council as per the written instructions

received by the Respondent by letter dated 25/09/2013. Thereafter, approval was

granted to proceed with the construction of the building on 03/05/2013. In the

impugned letters sent to the Respondent, the Appellants state that the Respondent

is constructing a building without a permit and! or in violation of the conditions of

the permit.

The Respondent is in possessIOn of a building plan which had been

approved by the Council, however, contends that presently no construction work

has been carried out in the said land. It is also contended that the 1st Appellant

Council has failed to give reasons, when it turned down the development approval.

"In terms of the Act "the Planning Procedure" referred to in part IIA in

Section BB identifies mailers pertaining to the (i) preparation; (ii) implementation

Page 12 oflS

and (iii) enforcement of a development plan. Hence, implementation of a ,

development plan falls within the broad caption of "Planning Procedure ". While

Section 8A to Section 8H deals with the manner in which a development plan has

to be prepared, Section 8J makes it clear that the purpose of issuing a permit is to

ensure that all development activities in development areas should corifirm to the

development plan". Perera, Municipal Commissioner Vs. Selvam (Supra). In

terms of Section 8J of the Act, the purpose of issuing a permit is to ensure that all

development activity in the development area should confirm to the development

plan and in accordance with the terms and conditions.

According to Section 8J (4) of the Act "The Authority may take into

consideration the recommendations of the Planning Committee, in granting or

refusing to issue a permit under this section ". Although there is no general duty to

give reasons it has become the rule for reasons to be given if a decision is to

withstand the test of review.

In Karunadasa Vs. Unique Gemstones Ltd. and others (1997) SLR 256, it

was held that, "in the context of the machinery for appeals, revisions, judicial and

the enforcement of fundamental rights, giving reasons is becoming increasingly

and important protection of the law, for if a party is not told the reasons for an

adverse decision his ability to seek review will be impaired". The giving of

reasons by the decision maker in the context of fairness was considered in Doody

Vs. Secretary of State for the Home Department (1993) 3AII "E.R. 92, where it

Page 13 of 15

was observed, inter alia, that "Fairness will very often require that a person who

may be affected by the decision will have an opportunity to make representation

on his own behalf either before the decision was taken with a view to producing a

favorable result, or after it is taken, with a view to procuring its modification or

both ".

In Mowjood Vs. Pussedeniya (1987) 1 SLR 63, the Court held that;

"In the matter of procedural fairness effective administration should be made

possible while preserving a reasonable degree of fairness in executive action for

the protection of the public. "

"Therefore, writ will be granted if it can be established that the Respondents had

the minimum of a duty to act fairly, even if they were not performing a strictly

judicial function " (J.B. Textiles Industries Ltd. Vs. Minister of Finance and

Planning (1981) 2 SLR 238).

When the Council informed the Respondent that he had no valid building

construction approval and! or that he is in violation of terms and conditions

fairness will very often require that he is informed the factors against his interest

in order to make a worthwhile representation. Even after responding to the

impugned letters, the Authority has failed to bring to the attention of the

Respondent the factors against his interest.

Page 14 of lS

Therefore in the context of procedural fairness, I find that the Council has

failed to afford the Respondent a "fair inquiry" prior to the decision taken as

reflected in the impugned decisions marked "P9" and "PIO", to proceed with the

construction according to the approval granted by the Council. As such the order

given by the learned High Court Judge is affirmed.

Application dismissed.

Dr. Ruwan Fernando, J.

I agree.
