Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner was appointed as a Probationary Lecturer in Export Agriculture at the 2nd

Respondent University w.e.f. 01.12.1998 (P1). The Petitioner applied and was granted overseas

study leave from 01.01.2004 to 31.01.2007 to follow a course at the University of Guelph,

Canada leading to the Ph.D. which was granted.

The Petitioner and the 2nd Respondent entered into an agreement (P2) by which the Petitioner

was granted the overseas leave. Later the Petitioner applied for maternity leave from

26.12.2006 to 07.05.2007 which was granted.

Thereafter, the Petitioner sought to extend her leave on three occasions which was granted.

Accordingly, she was granted an extension of study leave with pay from 08.05.2007 to

14.08.2007, without pay from 15.08.2007 to 07.05.2008 and a final extension of study leave

without pay from 08.05.2008 to 31.12.2008.

By letter dated 06.10.2008 (1R7), the 2nd Respondent informed the Petitioner that the

extension of leave up to 31.12.2008 was the last extension to be given. In fact, previously by

letter dated 18.06.2008 the 1st Respondent informed the Petitioner that the Council of the 2nd

Respondent had decided to limit the maximum period of study leave to read for a Ph.D. to four

years and that extension beyond four years is at the sole discretion of the 2nd Respondent.

The study leave granted to the Petitioner was to expire on 31.12.2008. By letter dated

12.12.2008 (P6) and e-mail dated 18.12.2008 (P7) the Petitioner sought medical leave from

01.01.2009 to April 2009 until the birth of her second child. In support of her application a

medical certificate dated 08.12.2008 (P9) issued by an Obstetrician in Canada was sent direct

on a letterhead without a seal. By letter dated 09.12.2008 (P8) the University of Guelph,

Canada informed that the Petitioner had defended her dissertation on 03.12.2008 and is

making editorial changes.

The 1st Respondent by letter dated 04.03.2009 informed the Petitioner that the 2nd Respondent

had decided to treat her as having vacated her employment with effect from 01.01.2009. The

Petitioner appealed to the 3rd Respondent University Services Appeal Board seeking a change of

the vacation of post notice. The appeal was dismissed (P14).

In this application, the Petitioner has sought the following reliefs:

(a) Writ of Certiorari to quash order (P14) dated 06.07.2010 made by the 5th, 6th and 7th

Respondents of the University Services Appeals Board;

Page 4 of 5

(b) Writ of Certiorari to quash decision (P10) made by the Governing Council of the 7th

Respondent University at its meeting held on 01.03.2009 to serve the vacation of post

notice on the Petitioner.

The Petitioner contends that the decision to consider her as having vacated post is arbitrary,

unreasonable and ultra vires the powers of the 2nd Respondent.

In Nelson De Silva v. Sri Lanka Engineering Services Corporation [(1996) 2 Sri.L.R. 242] it was

held that vacation of post had both a mental and physical element. The Petitioner contends

that in her case the mental element was not present.

However, the Respondents submitted that the mental element is present given that the

Petitioner had her first child abroad and planned to have a second child to be born soon after

the end of her final leave and having her family with her can lead to an inference that the

Petitioner was not intending to return.

These facts taken in isolation cannot in my view lead to an inference of the required mental

element to establish vacation of post. However, when these facts are taken together, they can

establish the required mental element.

Furthermore, it is observed that even before the University Services Appeal Board, the

Petitioner did not produce evidence to establish she had successfully completed the Ph.D.

program. Further, the Petitioner has given a power of attorney dated 23.10.2017 giving

authority to her sister to proceed with this case. The address of the Petitioner is given as No. 2

Dudley Drive, Guelph, Ontario, N1G OE5, Canada. All these factors no doubt further establish

the mental element.

In terms of the Agreement (P2) clause (12), any application by the Petitioner to extend the

Ph.D. course on the grounds of illness should have been supported by a certificate from a

medical officer approved by the Sri Lankan Embassy in Canada. The medical certificate (P9)

tendered by the Petitioner does not conform to this requirement.

Page 5 of 5

In Building Materials Corporation v. Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya [(1993) 2 Sri.L.R. 316] it was

held that illness not supported by a medical certificate is a mere ruse to avoid reporting to

work. The medical records submitted by the Petitioner to the University Services Appeals Board

indicates that she had gone to the hospital around October/November 2008 for bleeding (the

issue she highlights in her appeal) and that she was recommended only two days leave from her

studies. The records also state that bleeding during pregnancy can be a normal occurrence.

There is no certificate from any doctor or hospital to show that bleeding was severe or that she

had to bed rest or that the flight was harmful to her or the baby.

The Council of the 2nd Respondent had considered the fact that the Petitioner had been given a

total of 60 months leave, beyond the 4 year period approved by the Council and the fact that

the Petitioner had been specifically informed that she was given the last extension of leave up

to 31.12.2008 before deciding to treat her as having vacated post w.e.f. 01.01.2009.

The Council also took cognizance of clause 7.2 of chapter V of the University Establishments

Code which states that where a person does not return to the country to resume duties at the

end of the study leave period, he will be deemed to have vacated post and should be

immediately informed by registered post.

I hold that the impugned decisions are not arbitrary, unreasonable or ultra vires as alleged by

the Petitioner.

For all the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed with costs.
