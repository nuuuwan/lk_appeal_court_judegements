Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The 157th Respondent, the then Prime Minister, submitted a

Cabinet Memorandum P11 seeking the approval of the Cabinet

of Ministers to examine complaints relating to political

victimisation from those who had been employed or who were in

employment in the Government Service or Government-owned

Public Corporations and Banks, and to provide appropriate

reliefs to such persons. Upon consideration of the said Cabinet

Memorandum, the Cabinet of Ministers granted approval by

P12. Accordingly, a Political Victimisation Committee was

appointed and its recommendations were placed before the

Cabinet of Ministers. The Cabinet of Ministers approved the

same and directed the Cabinet decision thereon to be

implemented on or before 18.05.2016 vide P9 and the covering

letter to P9 marked X tendered with the written submissions of

the 1st-206th Respondents.

The Petitioner, Ceylon Bank Employees Union, which had

entered into a Collective Agreement with the 1st Respondent,

National Savings Bank, to safeguard the rights of the employees

of the said Bank, filed this application on 28.03.2017 seeking to

quash by a writ of certiorari the aforesaid Cabinet decision

(which is not before the Court), whereby reliefs were granted to

148 employees of the Bank (9th-156th Respondents) upon the

recommendations of the Political Victimisation Committee, as

well as the communication of the said Cabinet decision by P9.

The Petitioner does not say the Cabinet of Ministers had no

authority to appoint a Political Victimisation Committee to grant

3

reliefs to employees who were in fact politically victimised. What

the Petitioner says is that the employees to whom reliefs were

granted were not in fact politically victimised but were

interdicted, not promoted, dismissed from service etc. on merits

and in terms of the Service Minutes and Schemes of

Recruitment of the Bank. The Petitioner tenders a list of 140

employees by P10, whose names are apparently included in P9,

to say that those employees were not politically victimised.

Needless to say, this a question of fact the writ Court cannot

undertake to resolve.

The Petitioner says no reasons have been adduced in P9 for

granting reliefs to the employees stated therein. To ascertain

this fact, the Petitioner has not made the members of the

Political Victimisation Committee parties to this application. In

my view, they are necessary parties. Without giving a hearing to

the said members, this Court cannot set aside their

recommendations to the Cabinet of Ministers. It is these

recommendations which were converted to a Cabinet decision

and communicated by P9 to the Bank.

The Petitioner strenuously stresses that any relief granted to

employees of the Bank shall be in terms of the Banks Service

Minutes and Schemes of Recruitment. The Petitioner refers to

the Prime Ministers observation contained in P14 in this regard.

It is noteworthy that the Bank did not blindly implement the

Cabinet decision conveyed by P9. The Board of Directors of the

Bank considered P9 and decided to grant reliefs only to 100 of

the 148 employees mentioned in the Cabinet decision. To those

4

100 employees also, the Board of Directors did not give full effect

to the Cabinet decision. The Board of Directors took a policy

decision to grant only one promotion and give effect to it from

the date of the Cabinet decision. This the Bank did, I believe, in

harmony with its Service Minutes and Schemes of Recruitment.

As the Bank did not fully implement the Cabinet decision, 46

employees went before the Supreme Court alleging violation of

their fundamental rights in case No. SC/FR/154/2016. During

the pendency of the instant writ application, the Supreme Court

refused leave to proceed and dismissed the said fundamental

rights application. The Supreme Court further observed that the

Bank is at liberty to implement the recommendations arrived at

by the Bank, upon considering the recommendations of the

Political Victimisation Committee and the Appeal Committee, in

respect of the 46 employees. This means, the Supreme Court

did not find the recommendations of the Political Victimisation

Committee to be illegal or improper, but allowed the Bank to

consider them, subject to taking its own final decision. The

matter shall end here.

I refuse to issue notice on the Respondents. The application of

the Petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
