*****

Hon. Justice K. K. Wickremasinghe

This is a case where the Petitioner has not obtained sanction of the Attorney-

General. Therefore, in view of the case No CA/PHC/06/20 14 both parties agree

to send this case back to the High Court.

Considering Submissions of both Parties it is apparent that the Petitioner has

not obtained written sanction of the Hon. Attorney-General when filing of this

Revision Application. In view of case No CA/PHC/06/2014, both Parties agree

to send back this case to High Court of Panadura to hear the case afresh on

merits.

Accordingly, we set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge dated

21.09.2016 and the case is sent back to the High Court of Panadura for a fresh

hearing and determine on merits.

Registrar is directed to send copies of the order to the learned High Court

Judge and Magistrate's Court. 2

\

Revision application is allowed.

Hon. Justice Devika Abeyratne

I agree.
