Argued on: 27.08.2020

Decided on: 28.09.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This case is directly connected to Case No. CA/WRIT/85/2018,

in which the Judgment was delivered today.

In the said case, the Quit Notice served on the 1st Petitioner by

the Urban Development Authority (UDA) on the basis that the

UDA is the owner of Lots 1 and 14 of Plan No. 5534 was

quashed by certiorari.

In the instant case, what the Petitioners seek to quash by way of

a writ of certiorari is: (a) the P8 letter sent by the 2nd

Respondent, the Chairman of the UDA, to the Manager of the 1st

Petitioner directing the latter to stop construction on Lot 14 of

Plan No. 5534 forthwith, on the premise that the UDA is the

4

owner of this lot; and (b) the P9 letter sent by the 7th

Respondent, the Municipal Engineer of the Sri Jayawardenapura

Kotte Municipal Council, to the Manager of the 1st Petitioner

informing the latter that the approval of the Building Plan was

cancelled on information from the UDA that the land belongs to

the UDA.

In addition, the Petitioners seek a directive by way of a writ of

mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent, the UDA, and the 6th

Respondent, the Municipal Commissioner of the Sri

Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council, to extend the

Development Permit bearing No. BA/N/318/2016 according to

law and/or to determine the Petitioners application and issue a

building permit according to the Plan No. BA/N/318/2016 in

terms of the law. It shall be stressed that the Petitioners do not

seek the Court to compel the 1st and 6th Respondents to extend

the Development Permit or issue a Building Permit as a matter

of course but in terms of the law. It is up to the authorities to

consider the applications and take a decision in terms of the

law.

At the time of the argument, learned senior Deputy Solicitor

General appearing for the UDA in both cases rightly informed

Court that the main issue lies in the connected case,

CA/WRIT/85/2018, and the issue in the instant case springs

from the main issue. The main issue has now been decided

against the UDA.

In view of the reasoning and conclusion arrived at in

CA/WRIT/85/2018, I grant the reliefs to the Petitioners as

prayed for in paragraphs (b), (c), (d) and (g) of the prayer to the

petition.

5

The application of the Petitioners is allowed with costs.
