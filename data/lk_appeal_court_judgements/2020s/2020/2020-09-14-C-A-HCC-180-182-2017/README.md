ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal, lodged by the 1st, 4th and 5th accused-appellants

(hereinafter referred to as the 1 st, 4th and 5th Appellants respectively) against their

conviction and sentence.

In the indictment presented by the Hon. Attorney General, 1st to 5th

accused were charged under 11 counts, which included being members of an

unlawful assembly, causing hurt, murder, mischief by fire to two dwelling

houses, robbery without being a member of the said unlawful assembly and

causing hurt, murder, mischief, robbery with common intention. All five accused

elected a trial without a jury.

The prosecution led evidence of several lay witnesses who are immediate

family members of the deceased and also one of his neighbours. At the close of 2

the prosecution case, when the trial Court ruled that all the accused had a case to

answer they made statements from the dock.

The High Court of Gampaha convicted the 1st 4th and 5th accused for

committing murder of Hettiarachichige Sugath Nishantha Perera on 23.09.1994 with

common intention and also for causing mischief to property with common

intention, under the count Nos. 7 and 8 with its judgment pronounced on

02.05.2017. The 1st, 4th and 5th Appellants were sentenced to death. Other accused

were acquitted from all counts.

In challenging the validity of their conviction, learned Counsel for the 1st

and 4th Appellants at the hearing of their appeal had raised following grounds of

appeal;

a. the trial Court erred on critical issues of fact causing severe prejudice to

the appellants,

b. the conviction entered by the trial Court for the offence of murder is

clearly flawed,

c. no reliance could be placed on the inconsistent, erratic, unreliable

multiple dying declarations made by the deceased.

Learned Counsel for the 5th Appellant, whilst associating himself with the

above grounds of appeal, had, in addition, raised the following grounds of

appeal;

a. the trial Court failed to consider the prosecution evidence which

indicate the absence of intention to cause injury,

b. the trial Court had erroneously rejected the dock statements of the

Appellants upon a comparison made with the prosecution evidence.

3

In view of the several grounds of appeal raised by the three Appellants

and for its proper appreciation in the correct perspective, a brief account of the

evidence that had been presented before the trial Court is helpful at this stage of

the judgment.

The two houses that were set on fire were occupied by the members of the

deceased's family and were standing on the same property. The deceased was

married and had two young children. He was unemployed at the time of the

incident while his brother Ajith Kumara operated a boutique store adjacent to one

of the houses. The deceased lived in one of the houses with his sisters Suranji,

Nilanthi and Priyanganie while Ajith Kumara lived in the other with their parents.

The prosecution called the mother of the deceased Chandrani, , Priyanganie,

Ajith Kumara and one of their immediate neighbours, Upa/i as the witnesses who

saw the incident by which the two houses were burnt and the deceased had

suffered his burn injuries, resulted in his death 13 days later. Two sisters of the

deceased Suranji and Ni/anthi have committed suicide before the trial and their

depositions were led under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance.

The incident took place in the evening of 23.09.1994 after 7.00 p.m.

Priyangani was in the house where the deceased was when it was set on fire. He

was drunk and was sleeping in one of the rooms. She heard a commotion in front

of the house and when she peeped through the main door, saw the front part of

the house was already on fire. She sawall five accused there. She claimed that

the 4 th Appellant had a white can in his hand while the 5th Appellant was

carrying a television set. The 1st accused is the brother-in-law of the deceased.

Later she said the 1st accused also had a can and saw the 4th Appellant throwing

what he had in his can to the house. Thereafter the 3rd accused and 4th Appellant

4

had entered her house and shouted at them to run out since the house was set on

fire (G3.1D t5\Q)Q)) ~@QCl O~Q~). The witness tried to wake up her brother but since

the fire was raging she had run out to safety.

She took shelter in a nearby house and after the Police had visited the

scene, she saw the deceased who had crawled back to their land calling their

mother. The deceased told them that he was taken to an abandoned house and

was set on fire. The witness saw the deceased had burnt almost all of his skin

exposing pink skin. The Police helped them to rush the deceased to hospital.

Chandrani also claim to have seen the deceased crawling back but

according to her what the deceased said was it was his friends who did this to

him and thereafter mentioned all five names of the accused. She admits that she

did not see any of the Appellants near their houses that evening.

One of the deceased's sister Suranji said that she retired for the night by

9.00 p.m. and woke up after hearing a sound and found out that the house is on

fire. She ran out and hid herself near a breadfruit tree. She saw the 1st Appellant

splashing some liquid to the fire from a can, while the 5th Appellant used a torch

to light the rear part of her house up. The deceased was still inside the house but

no one took him out. According to Nilanthi, all five accused came that evening

and they chased the women out of the house saying that not to stay back and if

they did they too would be put to the fire. No one came to their rescue and when

someone splashed some liquid, the rear part of the house also caught fire.

Their immediate neighbour UpaZi, heard some shouting from the direction

of his neighbour's house. When he came out, saw the two houses were already

on fire. After a while he saw the deceased rolling down from the roof of his

5

house and fell outside. He also saw the 1st and 5th Appellants near the burning

houses but did not attribute any act to them.

IP Ranbanda of Ragama Police recorded the first information about this

incident on 24.09.1994 from Chandrani. He received message from Ragama

Hospital and visited the deceased who was being treated at that hospital. He was

screaming in pain but had said in a short statement" Ajith, Rajah, Shelton" had

caused his burn injuries.

Medical evidence revealed that the deceased had suffered burn injuries

over 48% of his body and at the time of medical examination these injuries were

already infected. The death of the deceased was due to septicaemia following

bum injuries.

With the above summary of evidence for the prosecution, this Court now

turns to consider the grounds of appeal in detail.

Relying on the prosecution evidence, learned Counsel for the 1st and 4th

Appellants contended that the conviction for murder entered by the trial Court

was on the basis of the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal Code. After

concluding that the three Appellants are responsible for setting the house on fire

while the deceased was still inside, the trial Court arrived at that conclusion. It

is her contention that the said conclusion is an erroneous one since there is clear

evidence that the deceased escaped from the burning house alive and according

to the prosecution witnesses the deceased himself said that he was set on fire at

an abandoned house at a different location. Thus, she contends that the bum

injuries sustained by the deceased were not due to the fact that the house he had

slept in was set on fire but due to a totally separate incident.

6

There is merit in this contention by the 1st and 4th Appellants. Witnesses

Priyanganie, Chandrani and Upali confirm that the deceased escaped from the

burning house alive. Nilanthi saw, when she re-entered the burnt house with

Police, that her brother had stacked two chairs on top of each other and had

escaped through the roof of the burning house. She was specific that he had no

bum injuries at that point of time.

Upali saw the deceased rolling down the roof and fall outside the house.

Both Priyanganie and Chandrani attribute bum injuries of the deceased to the act

of setting him on fire at the abandoned house, based on his statement made after

he crawled back into their garden. There is no evidence that the deceased had

suffered life threatening bum injuries when he escaped from the burning house

and Nilanthi negates any such inference. When the deceased had emerged from

hiding, Chandrani saw most of his skin had peeled off.

Therefore, the basis on which the trial Court found the three appellants

guilty to the offence of murder had no evidentiary support and ought to be set

aside.

In view of the above finding, the other aspect of the 1st and 4th Appellants

have highlighted over the unreliability of the multiple dying declarations

attributed to the deceased should be considered by this Court.

Since the deceased did not sustain injuries due to the act of the Appellants

in setting his house on fire, the only remaining basis to impute criminal liability

on them for his death should be based on the dying declaration made by the

deceased. The trial Court did not base its conviction on the dying declarations as

it found the Appellants guilty on the fourth limb of Section 294 of the Penal

7

Code. In the circumstances, this Court will have to consider the truthfulness and

reliability of the multiple dying declarations that re-attributed to the deceased.

Before this Court ventures to consider the truthfulness and reliability of

dying declaration, it is relevant to consider the applicable legal considerations

that are laid down by the superior Courts.

The Supreme Court in Sheela Sinharage v Attorney General (1985) 1 Sri

L.R. 1, reiterated the "necessity for the ipsissima verba used by a deceased in a dying

declaration". This Court in Ranasinghe v Attorney General (2007) 1 Sri L.R. 218

stated that;

" ... the trial Judge or the jury as the case may be must be satisfied

beyond reasonable doubt on the following matters. (a) Whether the

deceased, in fact, made such a statement. (b) Whether the statement

made by the deceased was true and accurate. (c) Whether the

statement made by the deceased person could be accepted beyond

reasonable doubt. (d) Whether the evidence of the witness who

testifies about the dying declaration could be accepted beyond

reasonable doubt. (e) Whether witness is telling the truth. (j)

Whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the

alleged declaration was made."

As the learned Counsel for the 1st and 4th Appellants contended, the

evidence reveal that there are multiple dying declarations that are attributed to

the deceased.

Mother of the deceased said the deceased told her " @~ Q)~@C)) tDOg

qoo)@~" and said all five names of the accused. Priyangani who also saw the

deceased at the same time said what the deceased told them was ")C) qO.ro

8

3\63ro 3\6\ OIQlQ)l". Nilanthi added that " lOS (3))cg@ (3)6\63cg@ q1.3oCl gClCl@

OClOClJcgCl~Oo\ qlroo!!))". The deceased himself mentioned three names only but did

not attribute any act to any of them.

When these somewhat inconsistent declarations that are attributed to the

deceased, this Court finds that none of the witnesses' evidence in relation to

multiple dying declarations could be accepted as truthful and reliable. The Police

officer merely stated that the deceased said" qc:l~ o~o~ q8o\, 0)0), <wcgoro Oo!!)

qo ClSro 3\6\ 0lQ) ClJCl)~ Ol@ " . The dying declaration made by the deceased

himself is bereft of any detail. It is not clear whether his mentioning of three

names in relation to the incident of setting fire to his house or to the incident his

mother and sister had attributed to him during which he claims to have

sustained burn injuries at the abandoned house.

In view of the above considerations, this Court is of the view that none of

these dying declarations satisfy the tests that had been enunciated by the judicial

precedents and should be rejected as unreliable, leaving no evidentiary basis to

sustain a conviction for murder. The contention of the Learned Counsel for the

5th Appellant that the evidence of the prosecution witness that the Appellant had

chased the occupants away after setting fire to the house negates any intention to

cause harm to them is relevant in this context.

The three Appellants were also found guilty of causing mischief, the count

No. 8 of the indictment, under Section 410 of the Penal Code with common

intention. This Court finds the said conviction is based on the available evidence

and is therefore justified. The 5th Appellant's contention that the trial Court had

failed to consider the prosecution evidence which indicate the absence of

intention to cause injury to anyone might not have direct reference to the

9

elements of the offence of mischief. The evidence is that the intruders claimed

that they set fire and shouted that the inmates to leave the burning house. The

requisite intention to cause damage and destruction to property is clearly evident

from the testimony of the witnesses.

The other contention of the 5th Appellant; that the trial Court had

erroneously rejected his dock statement upon a comparison with the prosecution

evidence, is apparently based on the statement in which the trial Court states that

" ... 016.I~@~ ~~Bool B ql6\ ~(5)Cl <;(01~ G:))01~ (';)le6\~@O (3)l~S~ 5 Cl~

ClJOCl i!Jog ClO ql6\ QiClO (';)z~O 001 Cl ".

In his statement from the dock, the 5th Appellant stated in relation to the

incident that he heard that his name transpired as the person who set fire to the

houses and therefore he went there to investigate.

The position that he went near the burning house merely to see what was

going on had not been put to any of the prosecution witnesses by the 5th

Appellant and was advanced for the first time in his statement from the dock. In

applying probability test, it is noted that his conduct of visiting the burning

houses as admitted by the 5th Appellant, especially when he is accused of the

said crime, is highly an improbable act.

The highlighted portion of the judgment is in relation to the said conduct

of the 5th Appellant and the impression that the wording used by the trial Court

creates in the mind of the reader that it had compared the two versions side by

side in determining to reject is a result of its manner of presentation and not

necessarily due to such a comparison.

10

Therefore, this Court is not convinced that the trial Court had in fact

compared the two versions of events and of the view that it was merely rejecting

the 5th Appellant's position that he was there at the scene only as an observer, by

applying the probability test.

In the circumstances, this Court partly allows the appeals of the 1st, 4th and

5th Appellants by setting aside their conviction for the offence of murder and the

sentence of death. Their conviction for the offence of mischief is accordingly

affirmed. The three Appellants are sentenced by this Court for 2 years of

imprisonment, being the maximum punishment with which they can be

punished. In view of the fact that they were incarcerated since their conviction on

02.05.2017, this Court accordingly imposes a fine of Rs, 100,000.00 on each of the

Appellants and in default six months of imprisonment. In the event the default

sentence is to be implemented, it should run consecutive to the other sentence.
