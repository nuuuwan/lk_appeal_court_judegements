The petition runs into 34 pages. There are 78 main paragraphs

in the body of the petition. The prayer to the petition alone

consists of 25 reliefs from (a) to (y). Unless pleadings are concise

and not prolix, Court will not see the wood for the trees.

Incidentally, this is a Forest Case!

It is reassuring that the Petitioner in the first paragraph of the

36 page consolidated written submission captures the real

grievance of the Petitioner in the following terms.

The Petitioner has come before Your Lordships Court

challenging the impropriety on the part of the 1st and 2nd

Respondents in conducting a purported inquiry and the

INSISTENCE OF THE 1ST AND 2ND RESPONDENTS TO

SUMMON THE CHAIRMAN AND DIRECTORS OF THE

PETITIONER COMPANY FOR THE PURPORTED INQUIRY

conducted by the 1st and 2nd Respondents in respect of the

Tourist Board land on which the Sigiriya Village Hotel is

situated together with a further land which is one

contiguous piece of land, but which is segregated,

(hereinafter referred to as the Farm land), which has been

possessed by the Petitioner for over 35 years and

challenging the purported basis of the proceedings before

the Magistrates Court of Dambulla, wherein the 1st and 2nd

Respondents produced two of the employees of the

Petitioner who had been engaged in farming on the Farm

Land on the purported basis that the said two employees

had been allegedly engaged in clearing state land.

4

From the above summary and the conclusion of the said

written submission, it is clear that the main purpose of filing

this application is to prevent the 1st and 2nd Respondents from

calling the Chairman of the Petitioner company to make a

statement in furtherance of an inquiry conducted by the 2nd

Respondent. I will in a while explain what this inquiry is about

and on what basis the Chairman is called to make a statement.

The said Respondents did not require the directors of the

Petitioner company to make statements although the Petitioner

drags them also onto the scene.

The reliefs sought by the Petitioner in the prayer to the petition

are as follows:

(b) Make order in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution and

of the same;

(e) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari,

directing them to strictly maintain the status quo until the

(x) For costs; and

(y) Such other and further reliefs that Your Lordships Court

shall seem meet.

Let me briefly outline the background facts.

The Petitioner was given a land in extent of 16 acres 3 roods and

7.5 perches on a long lease vide P8 and P10. It appears this is

where the Sigiriya Village Hotel is situated. I presume there is

no contest over this Hotel Land.

The Petitioner says, subject to a formal lease agreement being

executed, the then Government Agent of Matale by P13 dated

24.09.1980 placed the Petitioner in possession of another

portion of land in extent of 7 acres 1 rood and 32 perches

adjoining the said Hotel Land in order to run a Farm. The

formal lease agreement is yet to be executed. The Petitioner

does not seek relief on the basis of non-execution of the formal

lease of the said Farm Land.

10

It is noticeable that P13 dated 24.09.1980 is addressed not to

the Petitioner company but to a different company, which the

Petitioner in the written submission says is the parent company

of the Petitioner company. But the Petitioner company was

incorporated in 1978.

The 4th Respondent Divisional Secretary of Dambulla has

tendered with his statement of objections an Annual Permit

marked 4R1 to say that the said permit in respect of a land in

extent of 15 acres and 1 rood, situated in front of the Sigiriya

Village Hotel, was given to the Sigiriya Village Hotel. The 4th

Respondent says the payment receipts tendered by the Petitioner

marked P16(a)-P16(d) are in relation to the said Permit Land and

not in relation to the Farm Land as claimed by the Petitioner in

the petition. This Annual Permit has been issued in the name of

the Manager of the Sigiriya Village Hotel. Strangely, the

Petitioner has neither disclosed this Annual Permit in the

petition nor said a word about it in the counter affidavit.

However in the consolidated written submission, the Petitioner

admits that the receipts tendered as rentals paid on the Farm

Land are in fact rentals paid on the Permit Land, which is

different to both the Hotel Land and the Farm Land.

In a writ application, the Petitioner cannot suppress or

misrepresent material facts. In my view, this Permit Land

comprising 15 acres and 1 rood lying in front of the Hotel Land

given on an Annual Permit is a material fact. The Petitioner is

continuously paying annual rental on this land. The Petitioner

could not have forgotten about it. Nor could the Petitioner have

confused this 15 acre Permit Land with the Hotel Land and the

11

Farm Land. The Petitioner in paragraph 40 refers to its efforts

to obtain a long term lease on the Farm Land, and the other

lands in its close proximity. This Permit Land is important

because the 4th Respondent in his statement of objections says

the Government Surveyor was informed to survey the Permit

Land and the Hotel Land.

As I have said above, the Petitioners grievance is against the 1st

and 2nd Respondents, the Director General of Wildlife

Conservation and the Wildlife Range Officer at Sigiriya,

respectively. To be precise, the Petitioner is challenging the 2nd

Respondents attempts to call the Chairman of the Sigiriya

Village Hotel to make a statement in respect of further

investigation into the matter reported to the Magistrates Court

of Dambulla in Case No. B/453/2016.

Proceedings before the Magistrates Court had been initiated

upon two persons being arrested whilst clearing the Sigiriya

Sanctuary, allegedly on the instructions of the Manager of the

Sigiriya Village Hotel. The Petitioner in paragraph 41 admits

that the arrested persons are Hotel employees. The Manager of

the Hotel was arrested and produced before the learned

Magistrate on this basis.

The Petitioner in paragraph 13 of the petition acknowledges that

the subject matter of this application came under the purview of

the 1st and 2nd Respondents with the declaration of the land

described in the Extraordinary Government Gazette No.594/12

dated 26.01.1990 marked P3 as the Sigiriya Sanctuary.

Although the Petitioner seeks to quash various purported

decisions made by the Respondents, no such decisions have

been tendered. In fact, there are no such decisions. The Court

cannot quash purported decisions on a hypothetical basis. Apart

from the uncontested Lease Agreement P10, which relates to the

Hotel Land, the only two documents identified by the Petitioner

in the prayer to the petition are P26 and P31 whereby the

Chairman of the Petitioner company was asked to be present

before the 2nd Respondent to record a statement.

The Petitioner in the written submission says the Petitioner does

not attempt to thwart or undermine the lawful powers vested in

the Respondents. Nonetheless, the Petitioner does not explain

to this Court the legal basis on which it seeks to quash P26 and

P31 by certiorari. The Petitioners position is:

The Petitioner has strong cause to apprehend that the

summoning of the Chairman of the Petitioner company is an

attempt to apply collateral and extraneous pressures and

that this is a prelude to summoning the other directors of

17

the board as well. The Petitioner states that there are

several officers who are fully conversant and intimate with

the entirety of the Petitioners project approvals, operations

etc., who can assist the Respondents in any inquiry that is

lawfully conducted. As such, the summoning of the

Chairman and/or the Directors is and will be unnecessary

to say the least.

The Petitioner cannot decide who is or is not necessary to be

questioned in the investigation into the matter.

In paragraph 66 of the petition, the Petitioner alleges violations

of fundamental rights by the 1st and 2nd Respondents in

embarking upon this inquiry. That shall be canvassed in a

different forum.

To the contrary, the 2nd Respondent in P26 and P31 explains the

legal basis on which he seeks to call the Chairman of the

Petitioner to make a statement in pursuance of the investigation

into the matter already reported to the Magistrates Court of

Dambulla. The Petitioner does not say the said legal basis is

erroneous.

The Petitioner inter alia seeks writs of mandamus compelling the

2nd Respondent to confine his inquiry to the matters reported to

the Magistrates Court of Dambulla in Case No. B/453/2016,

and compelling the 1st and 2nd Respondents to move the learned

Magistrate to discharge the Petitioner company from the

proceedings or refrain from proceeding further against the

Petitioner and its employees. These are vague reliefs. The

Petitioner company is not a party to the proceedings to be

18

discharged therefrom. This Court cannot order the two

employees of the Petitioner who were arrested for clearing the

Sigiriya Sanctuary and produced before the Magistrates Court

be discharged. The matters reported in the Magistrates Court,

which I have quoted above, encompass recording statements

from various parties for the investigation into the matter. What

authority does this Court have to give instructions to the

Director General of Wildlife Conservation on how to conduct this

investigation? All of these applications can be made before the

learned Magistrate in the said case and the desired Orders can

be sought. This includes the Petitioners protest against calling

the Chairman of the Petitioner company to make a statement at

the investigation. The P26 and P31 letters clearly highlight that

the request for a statement by the Chairman is made in relation

to the case in the Magistrates Court. If the Petitioner is

dissatisfied with the ruling of the learned Magistrate, there is a

procedure in place for appeal.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents in their joint statement of

objections state that Case No. B/453/2016 was filed under the

Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance and the 2nd Respondent

embarked upon the investigation within his legal powers under

the said Ordinance. They further say the Chairman of the

Sigiriya Village Hotel was required to be present to collect

information pertaining to the legal ownership of the land and

other matters. Their position is that the Petitioner has

encroached [on] the [Sigiriya] sanctuary illegally exceeding the

land allocated for the Hotel. The plan and the report prepared

upon the Orders of the learned Magistrate in the aforementioned

case have been tendered marked 1R1 and 1R2. Accordingly, the

19

1st and 2nd Respondents say the Petitioner is in occupation of an

additional 10 acres of land. The impugned inquiry relates to the

alleged illegal encroachment upon the Sigiriya Sanctuary.

The Petitioner has unnecessarily taken great pains to show the

inaccuracies in 1R1 and 1R2. It is plain law that consideration

of those matters is outside the purview of this Court.

In my view, this application is misconceived in law and devoid of

merit.

I unhesitatingly dismiss the application with costs.
