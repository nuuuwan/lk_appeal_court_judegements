ARGUED ON 26.02.2020

ORDER ON 13.03.2020

K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO, J.

01. Accused-Appellant-Petitioner-Petitioner (Petitioner) was indicted with 3 others in the High Court

of Balapitiya for robbery punishable in terms of section 380 of the Penal Code. After trial the

learned High Court Judge convicted the Petitioner for the said offence and was sentenced on

12.12.2018, to rigorous imprisonment for 5 years. Petitioner was further imposed a fine of Rs.

10, 000/- and also ordered to pay the complainant Rs. 1,000,000/- as compensation. Petitioner

appealed against the above conviction to the Court of Appeal under case No. HCC 337/2018.

02. Petitioner pursued an application for bail pending appeal in the High Court of Balapitiya in

application No. 3700/2019, where bail was refused by the learned High Court Judge on

14.06.2019. Thereafter, the Petitioner filed another application for bail pending appeal in the

High Court in application No. 3784/2019. The learned High Court Judge dismissed the above

mentioned 2nd application on 22.1 1.2019 without issuing notice to the Respondent. Reason stated

for the dismissal was that the Petitioner has failed to submit any change in circumstances after

the refusal of the 1st application for bail pending appeal. Being aggrieved by the above dismissal

of the 2nd application, Petitioner filed the instant revision application to get the order of the

learned High Court Judge dated 22.11.2019 revised/set aside and to grant bail pending appeal to

the Petitioner.

03. Learned counsel for the Petitioner contended that the learned High Court Judge's order is

arbitrary and would shock the conscience of this court. As exceptional circumstances, counsel

3

submitted that the prevailing health condition of the Petitioner warrants granting of bail. It was

further submitted that as the sentence imposed is 5 years, substantial part of the sentence would

be served by the time the appeal is decided.

04. Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent submitted that the circumstances urged by

the Petitioner cannot be considered as exceptional. Further, learned DSG submitted that Medical

Reports received by the court do not support the application of the Petitioner.

05. It is settled law that bail pending appeal from the High Court would be granted only in

exceptional circumstances (Ediriweera V. Attorney General C.A. (PHC) 2512005, Attorney

General V. Letchchemi and another S.c. Appeal 1312006).

06. Exceptional circumstances may vary from case to case. Sri Lankan Superior Courts have

considered long delay in hearing the appeal and ill health of an Appel lant (although those

circumstances are not exhaustive) as exceptional circumstances to grant bail pending appeal.

07. In his petition in the 2"d application for bail (No. 3784/2019) in the High Court, the Petitioner has

clearly averred in paragraphs 10 and II , his inability to submit the relevant medical certificates

pertaining to his illness. He also has averred that, although he requested for the medical

certificates from the Superintendent of Prisons, Galle and also from the Medical Officer, they

had refused to give him. Hence, the Petitioner has requested the High Court to issue an order to

the Superintendent of Prisons, Galle to submit the relevant medical certificates pertaining to his

illness.

08. The learned High Court Judge, without making such directive or making any order with regard to

that application, has dismissed the revision application in limine, stating that there had been no

change in circumstances. In my view, the learned High Court Judge should have called for the

Medical Reports from the prison authorities in the interest of justice, as the prison authorities

have refused to release the same to the Petitioner. It was incumbent upon the learned High Court

Judge to go through the Medical Reports, to come to a findin g whether there were changes in

circumstances and whether the ill health of the Petitioner could have considered as an

4

exceptional circumstance to grant bail. Hence, it is my considered view that the learned High

Court Judge fell into error when he dismissed the 2nd bail application on 22.11.2019 for want of

change in circumstances, without giving an opportunity for the Petitioner to obtain the Medical

Reports through Court to prove the availability of the change in circumstances.

09. Upon filing the instant revision application, on the request of the Petitioner, this court as per

journal entry dated 17.12.2019, has ordered the Superintendent of Prisons, Galle to produce the

relevant Medical Reports of the Petitioner. This court has received the certified copies of the

Medical Reports of the Petitioner from the prison authorities on 16th January 2020.

10. According to the Medical Reports submitted, Petitioner has undergone surgery in the year 2013 to

remove a tumor in the bladder. No Medical Reports for the period between 2013 and 2018 have

been submitted. Which means, Petitioner has failed to submit any Medical Reports for any of his

illnesses for the period between year 2013 and 2018 when he was on bail pending trial. After

conviction, he has undergone investigation procedures for a complaint of hematoma. He had been

seen by the consultant Urological surgeon. Petitioner's complaint is being investigated by the

specialist doctors, and there is no evidence before court that the Petitioner's health condition

could not be treated at the prison hospital or any other government hospital. Consultant

Urological Surgeon Dr. Dimantha de Silva has recommended few more investigating procedures

and that the Petitioner should not get exposed to smoke as it increases the risk of recurrence of his

earlier sickness that he was treated. Medical Report does not recommend or state that Petitioner's

health would be at risk in prison. There is no evidence before this court to the effect that there is

more smoke inside the prison than outside. Thus, the Petitioner's complaint of ill health is

insufficient to constitute 'exceptional circumstances' even at this stage.

II. The ground, that there would be an inordinate delay in hearing the appeal, also was urged by the

Petitioner to be considered as an exceptional circumstance. Petitioner was convicted and

sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years on 12.12.2018. In default of payment of fine and

compensation, he was sentenced further to 6 months and 18 months simple imprisonment

respectively.

12. In case of Ediriweera V. Attorney General [2006[ 1 Sri L.R. 25, Majority Court held, the fact

that the final determination of the appeal could take many years could be considered as a 'long

delay' and thus falls under the category of exceptional circumstances.

13. In case of Harbhajan Sing and Others V. The State of Punjab [1977[ Cri. L.J. 1424, Court

observed;

"".the petitioners who have been sentenced to seven years'

imprisonment would have undergone nearly the whole, or in any case, a

substantial part of their sentence by that time. That is a factor which we

are unable to ignore in the present case. Nor can we accede to the stand

that the delay in this context is irrelevant to the issue. "

Court further held that the administration of justice is a matter of substance and not merely one

of academics. It would afford scant satisfaction to the Accused if after serving their full or

substantial portion of their jail sentence, their appeal succeeds and they are merely acquitted of

the charge. This factor cannot be ignored.

14. However, in case of Attorney General V. Letchchemi and another (supra), Court held;

"".According to the facts and circumstances of the case, unless it

can be proved that the delay is inordinate, beyond the period of sentence

and therefore exceptional in terms of the particulars 10 that case, as the

usual delay is something that is common to all cases in this country and

not except iona!. "

Court further held that the improbability of the convicted person not abscond ing would not be a

relevant consideration in application for bail pending appeal, although it could be relevant in an

application for bail pending trial.

6

15. In light of the above case precedents, the delay in hearing the appeal has to be substantial to

consider that as an exceptional circumstance. Unless it can be proved that the delay is inordinate,

beyond the period of sentence, or at least that the Petitioner has served nearly the whole or a

substantial part of the sentence by the time the appeal was heard, the mere delay would not be

exceptional to grant bail pending appeal.

16. It is important to note that it is not the term of the sentence of imprisonment that is relevant here,

but the delay in hearing the appeal in comparison to the term of the sentence.

17. In the instant case, the substantive appeal is already fixed for argument on 10.06.2020. By that

time the Petitioner has served about 18 months out of the sentence of 5 years, which cannot be

taken as a whole or substantial portion of the sentence imposed. The delay is neither unusual, nor

exceptional. Hence, this ground should necessarily fail.

18. In the above premise, although the learned High Court Judge was in error in dismissing the

application in limine, I find that the Petitioner has failed to submit exceptional circumstances to

grant bail pending appeal.

Hence, Revision application is dismissed.

K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J

I agree.
