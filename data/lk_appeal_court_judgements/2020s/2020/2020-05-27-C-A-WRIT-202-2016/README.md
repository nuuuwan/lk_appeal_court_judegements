Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The contest in this application is between the Petitioner and the

4th Respondent who are siblings. Their deceased father, Hene

Gedera Pelis, was issued a Permit under the Land Development

Ordinance in the year 1954. By that Permit marked P3, Pelis

was given about 3 Acres in extent of high land and about 5.4

Acres in extent of paddy land. No survey was conducted of the

land, and therefore the Permit does not give any boundaries to

the said two parcels of land. There is no issue in respect of the

paddy land. The issue is in respect of the high land.

Pelis first nominated his eldest son, Jinadasa, as the successor

to the land. As seen from P3, this nomination had been

cancelled in 1977 and the 4th Respondent, Bodhipala, was

nominated as the successor.

What is marked R1 by the 1st Respondent, Mahaweli Authority,

is the office copy of the same Permit P3. Both parties accept R1.

R1 has additional endorsements on page 1 in comparison with

P3.

4

One such additional endorsement is the insertion of the name of

the 4th Respondent as the Permit holder. This had been done in

2010, after the death of Pelis, the original Permit holder, on the

basis that the 4th Respondent was the nominated successor.

Thereafter in 2013, a Grant was issued in the name of the 4th

Respondent.

Prior to the Grant being issued, the land had been surveyed by

the Surveyor-General and the Plan prepared in 1990 is marked

P2/4R1. As a result, the land is identified in the said Grant

with definite boundaries and extent. That is, by the said Grant,

Lot No.456 in extent of 1.723 Hectares, which is 4 Acres and 41

Perches, has been given to the 4th Respondent.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking the following reliefs

in the prayer to the petition.

(a) Issue Notice on the Respondents

(b) Call for and examine the entire record pertaining to the

subject matter of this application;

(c) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of certiorari

quashing the grant marked P18;

(d) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of

mandamus directing the 1st to 3rd Respondents to

recommend to His Excellency the President to

revoke/cancel the grant issued in the name of the 4th

Respondent marked P18;

(e) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of

mandamus directing the 1st to 3rd Respondents to issue a

5

permit and/or a grant to the Petitioner for the land

alienated to his father under the said Permit bearing

No.528 marked P3;

(f) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of

mandamus directing the 1st to 3rd Respondents to continue

with the process initiated under P4 to nominate the

successor to the land alienated under the said Permit

bearing No.528 marked P3, in terms of the provisions of

Section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance;

(g) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of

mandamus directing/compelling the 1st to 3rd Respondents

to issue a permit to the Petitioner for the excess portion of

Lot No.456 of the Final Colony Plan No. 29 marked P2

which is not covered by the said Permit bearing No.528

marked P3;

(h) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a writ of

mandamus directing/compelling the 1st to 3rd Respondents

to hold an inquiry under the provisions of the Land

Development Ordinance to issue a permit to the Petitioner

for the excess portion of Lot No.456 of the Final Colony Plan

No. 29 marked P2 which is not covered by the said

Permit bearing No.528 marked P3;

(i) Grant costs;

(j) Grant such other and further reliefs.

The submission of learned Counsel for the Petitioner is two-fold.

The principal argument of learned Counsel for the Petitioner is

that notwithstanding the 4th Respondent was nominated as the

6

successor, the 4th Respondent failed to succeed to the land in

terms of section 68(2) of the Land Development Ordinance, and

therefore, inserting the name of the 4th Respondent as the

Permit holder in R1 and the consequent Grant issued in favour

of the 4th Respondent are illegal.

After the full argument, learned Counsel for the Petitioner

abandoned this position, as there is overwhelming evidence to

prove possession of the land by the 4th Respondent, which

negates the contention that the 4th Respondent failed to succeed

to the land despite nomination.

The next argument of learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that,

in any event, the 4th Respondent could not have been granted 4

Acres and 41 Perches; the maximum which could be granted to

the 4th Respondent is only 3 Acres, and the balance portion of

the land depicted in Plan P2/4R1 should be given to the

Petitioner.

Counsel says this on the basis that the Permit P3/R1 refers to

only 3 Acres, and not 4 Acres and 41 Perches. He argues that it

is the Permit which matures into a Grant, and therefore a larger

extent than what is stated in the Permit cannot be conveyed by

way of a Grant.

I regret my inability to agree with this argument for several

reasons.

When the Permit was issued, there was no Survey Plan.

Therefore, the land was described in the Permit as a land

containing in extent about 3.0 acres without any boundaries.

7

Hence it is not correct to say that what was given by the Permit

was only a land of 3 Acres in extent and nothing more.

According to section 19(3) of the Land Development Ordinance,

there shall be a Plan prepared by the Surveyor-General before a

Permit is issued, in order to precisely identify the land by

boundaries and in extent. The relevant part of this section reads

as follows:

The Government Agent shall in addition cause the land

alienated on such a permit to be surveyed by the Surveyor-

General, and the extent and description (by reference to

metes and bounds) of the land so surveyed shall be

inserted in such permit. The Government Agent shall in

addition, cause the permit to be registered; no fee shall be

paid or recovered for such registration.

However, when the Permit P3/R1 was issued, there was no Plan

on the basis of which the land could be identified. On that

ground, the Permit does not become null and void.

Section 19(4) of the Land Development Ordinance reads as

follows:

A permit-holder shall be issued a grant in respect of the

land of which he is in occupation

(a) where he has paid all sums which he is required

to pay under subsection (2);

8

(b) where he has complied with all the other

conditions specified in the Schedule to the permit;

and

(c) where he has been in occupation of, and fully

developed, to the satisfaction of the Government

Agent

(i) irrigated land, for a period of three years, or

(ii) high land, for a period of one year,

Provided, however, that the Land

Commissioner may issue a grant before the

expiry of the aforesaid period where the permit-

holder satisfies him that the failure to issue

such grant before the expiry of such period

would adversely affect the development of

such land.

It is true that in terms of section 19(2), a person shall in the first

instance receive a Permit authorising him to occupy the land. In

terms of section 19(4), A Permit holder shall be issued a grant in

respect of the land of which he is in occupation, and [has] fully

developed, if it is a high land, for a period of one year.

According to the Tenement List marked 4R2, prepared by the

Surveyor-General together with the Plan P2/4R1 made in 1990,

the 4th Respondent had been in possession of the entire land

depicted as Lot 456 of Plan P2/4R1 on Permit No.528 marked

P3/R1. The Surveyor-General in 4R2 notes Garden contains

two permanent buildings and coconut and mango trees 20-30

9

years. The Petitioner was not in occupation of this Lot or any

part of it. The Tenement List had been prepared in order to

issue Grants to the occupants, as seen from the Remarks

column of 4R2. This has been further confirmed by the

Divisional Manager of the Mahaweli Authority of Attanakadawala

by R3.

The Petitioner also admits in paragraph 7 of the petition that

under the Permit bearing No. 528 issued under the Land

Development Ordinance, the Petitioners father Hene Gedera Pelis

came into possession of the said high land depicted as Lot No.456

in the Final Colony Plan marked P2/4R1.

Hence it is clear that first the original Permit holder and then

the 4th Respondent have been in occupation of the entire Lot

No.456, comprising 1.723 Hectares, as the Permit land since

1954.

This continued until the Petitioners son, Thushitha Kumara, on

16.01.2006, either forcibly or unknown to the 4th Respondent

entered into possession of a portion of the land hitherto in the

possession of the 4th Respondent. This is admitted by the

Petitioner and his son in statements made to the police found in

the documents compendiously marked P5.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner places special emphasis on

the endorsement FCP 29 from 456 only 3 Acres appearing on

the first page of R1, presumably made by the Additional

Government Agent of Polonnaruwa on the same day the 4th

Respondents name was inserted as the Permit holder. This was

in 2010. It is not clear on what basis the said endorsement was

10

made. There is also no evidence to say that it was made with

the knowledge of the 4th Respondent. Although the incumbent

Divisional Secretary was later made a party to this application,

he has opted to remain silent. In any event, the Government

Agent could not have taken such a decision arbitrarily denying

the legitimate rights of the 4th Respondent.

However, the Grant has been issued in the name of the 4th

Respondent in the year 2013 in respect of the entire Lot No. 456.

Upon a directive of a previous Bench of this Court, the file

maintained by the Mahaweli Authority in respect of this land

was called for. Learned Counsel for the Petitioner, drawing the

attention of this Court to a letter dated 07.12.2016 written after

the filing of this application by the Resident Manager of

Bakamuna to the Director/Legal of the Mahaweli Authority

under the heading of the present case number, argues that the

decision to give the entire Lot consisting of 4 Acres and 41

Perches, as opposed to 3 Acres, was taken on the erroneous

basis that the 4th Respondents ownership of the land had been

confirmed by the Section 66 application filed by the police in the

Magistrates Court and the civil case filed by the Petitioner in the

District Court. If this is in fact the basis upon which the

decision was taken, I would agree with Counsel for the Petitioner

that the decision is unjustifiable, because the 4th Respondents

ownership has not been decided in those two cases. However,

there is no evidence to the effect that the said decision was

taken on this basis. It is the submission of learned State

Counsel for the Respondents that the said letter contains mere

observations of an officer during the pendency of this case upon

11

the request of the State Counsel handling the case, and it does

not constitute the reason for issuing the Grant in respect of the

whole of Lot No.456. Perusal of the said document affirms State

Counsels submission. The observations are in a separate loose

paper without an authorising signature. Such observations

cannot decide the fate of the 4th Respondent, unless an official

document to that effect is presented before this Court.

The second argument of Counsel for the Petitioner fails.

For the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the

Petitioner but without costs.
