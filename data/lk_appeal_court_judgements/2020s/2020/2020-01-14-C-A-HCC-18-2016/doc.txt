K. K. Wickremasinghe, J.

Counsel for the Accused-Appellant informs Court that he is

withdrawing the appeal against the conviction and therefore the

conviction against the accused-appellant is affirmed. Both parties make

submissions with regard to the sentence. Counsel for the Appellant

informs Court that he has filed documents with regard to the health

condition of the Appellant. Further he informs Court that he depends

on the written submissions filed by the Counsel as marked 'Y' where

he states that the Accused-Appellant had been charged for criminal

breach of trust, where the bank he was working during the year 1989

and according to the indictment he had committed criminal breach of

trust for sum of Rs. 302,900/= (Rupees three lacks two thousand nine

hundred ). The offence was committed thirty years ago and indictment

was filed in April 1996 which was six years after the date of offence

and after trial he was convicted on 29.01.2016. Sentence and the

conviction was on the same date.

It is being noted that both Counsel for the defence and

the prosecution had obtained so many dates and the case was postponed

for so many occasions. Further the Counsel for the Appellant informs

that the accused-appellant is now bed ridden and suffering from

renal failure. He has submitted medical evidence with regard to the

current situation in 'X3'.

The Counsel for the Respondent Ms. Anoopo De Silva, Senior

State Counsel while submitting the case King Vs. Rankira (42 N.L.R. page

145) informs Court, that "the Court of Criminal Appeal will not interfere

with the judicial discretion of a Judge in passing sentence unless that

discretion has been exercised on a wrong principle. I respectfully submit

that the sentencing order of the learned High Court Judge not been

imposed on a wrong principle. He has taking into consideration the verbal

submissions made and no documents had been submitted to the learned

High Court Judge at the time in which the submissions in mitigation were

made and therefore, on the verbal submissions the learned High Court

Judge imposed 5 years Rigorous Imprisonment and I submit to Hon. Court

that in the case of M Jude allYs. State of Rajasthan.

The Rajasthan High Court held My Lord a question of sentence is a matter

of discretion and it is well settled law when discretion has been properly

exercised on a accepted judicial line and appellate Court should not

interfere with sentencing an accused person. It is a sensitive exercise of

discretion and not a routine or mechanical prescription acting on hunch.

And my Lord and in the case of the Attorney General Vs. Mendis it

was held by H/L Justice Goonesekera for some offences generally

speaking longer sentences of imprisonment are appropriate such as for

example most robberies, most offences involving serious violence use

of weapon to wound burglary of private dwelling houses planned

crime for wholesale profit. So this is a case of planned crime for

wholesale profit My lord. And My Lord the accused in this case

functioned as the Manager of the Haldummulla branch of the Bank of

Ceylon and the due administration of the entirety of the Bank was

carried out by the accused, the Haldummulla branch of the Bank of

Ceylon comprised of two clerks, Cashier and a Security Guard. He

manipulated the entire system My Lord. The auditors investigation

reveal that the Manager the accused had misappropriated mishandled

and manipulated the entire system. And also My Lord the fact that

white collar crimes attack the fibre of the con tries economic structure

and there cases are not got private gain. His crimes being imbalanced of

the economy of the country and therefore My Lord serious approach

should be taken with regard to offences of this nature and he was

lucky to have five years R.I. It is not illegal My Lord suspend the

sentence for the other case and therefore no ground for the sentence

to be reduced and therefore those are my submissions.

Counsel heard and submits that this is a serious type

case where the accused-appellant had preplanned and misappropriated

is money being a manager of the bank.

Considering the date of offence and we consider the

date of offence and the date of conviction and also the submissions

made by learned Counsel for the Appellant with regard to health

condition at the date of sentence we consider the bring down

sentence imposed on the appellant. Further we are mindful of the

fact that the appellant has committed a grave crime which affects the

economy of the country and particular crime was a plan one. Further

we considered the case submitted by Counsel for the accused-appellant

Karunarathne Vs. State 78 NLR 413 where it was held that "When a

deserving Conviction and Sentence have to be confirmed by 10 years

after the Proved Offence the Judge can't disregard the serious

consequences and disorganization that it can cause to the Accused's

family. Therefore the delay of 10 years to finally conclude the Case is a

very relevant circumstance to be taken in to consideration and in the

circumstances of the Case a Suspended Sentence was considered

appropriate"

We consider the judgments cited by both parties and

accordingly considering above facts we are not inclined to suspend the

sentence and we affirm the conviction and bring down the sentence of

5 years rigorous imprisonment to one year rigorous imprisonment and

affirm the fine. Rest of the sentence (fine of Rs. 736,350/=) and the

default sentence will remain unchanged. Considering above facts we are

not inclined to suspend the sentence.

Subject to the above mentioned variation the appeal is hereby

dismissed.

Registrar is directed to send copies of the order to the

relevant High Court of Badulla.
