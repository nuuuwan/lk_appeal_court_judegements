ARGUED ON 26.06.2020

JUDGMENT ON 10.07.2020

K. PRlY ANTHA FERNANDO, J.

01. The Accused-Petitioner (Petitioner) by this application seeks to get the orders of the learned

High Court Judge dated 03 .05.19 and 09.0S.19 remanding the Petitioner revised.

02. Learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the orders of remand made by the learned

High Court Judge are wrong, illegal, irregular, malicious, capricious, arbitrary and bad in

law. Further, it was submitted that the Petitioner is suffering from recurrent depressive

disorder and being in remand could be detrimental to him and the family.

03. Objecting to the application, learned State Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the

Petitioner has failed to appear in the High Court on two occasions and had also made several

threatening calls to the aggrieved party and his family threatening them to abstain from

coming to the Court.

04. The Petitioner is indicted on two counts of being cruelty to a child punishable in terms of

section 30S(a)2 of the Penal Code. Upon serving indictment the learned High Court Judge

had released the Petitioner on bail.

05. On 17.01.2019 when the case was called in the High Court for trial, the Petitioner had been

absent. Victim child had been present. Learned High Court Judge had issued warrant on the

Petitioner. On 21.01.2019, the Petitioner had surrendered to the Court stating that he by

mistake had been in some other Court room. The learned High Court Judge had recalled the

warrant and had released the Petitioner on same bail.

,

06. On 03.05.2019 when the case was called in the morning the Petitioner had been present in

the Court, however, when the case was called later for trial, the Petitioner had left the Court.

Aggrieved party had complained to the Court that the Petitioner had threatened the victim

child not to attend Court. Petitioner is the step-father of the victim child. Again, the learned

High Court Judge had issued warrant on him. On 21.05.2019, the Petitioner had again

surrendered. No valid excuse had been tendered by the Petitioner for avoiding Court the

previous day. Hence, the learned High Court Judge remanded the Petitioner.

07. On 09.08 2019, counsel for the Petitioner made another application for bail in the High

Court on medical grounds, which was also refused by the learned High Court Judge for

gi ven reasons.

08. Section 14(1) of the Bail Act provides for cancellation of a subsisting bail order.

" (1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding provisions of this Act,

whenever a person suspected or accused of being concerned in committing or having

commilled a bailable or non-bailable offence, appears, is brought before or

surrenders to the court having jurisdiction, the court may refuse to release such

person on bail or upon application being made in that behalf by a police officer, and

ajier issuing notice on the person concerned and hearing him personally or through

his attorney-at-law, cancel a subsisting order releasing such person on bail if the

court has reason to believe:-

(a) that such person would-

(i) not appear to stand his inquiry or trial;

(U) interfere with the witnesses or the evidence against him or otherwise

obstruct the course of justice; or

(iii) commit an offence while on bail; or

(b) that the particular gravity of, and public reaction to, the alleged offence may

give rise to public disquiet. "

09. Petitioner for no good reason had been absent on two occasions when the Court was ready to

take up the trial. Victim child had been present in the Court. In the circumstances, it is clear

that the Petitioner was obstructing the course of justice by being absent to avoid the trial.

The chances of the Petitioner not appearing to stand trial are high. There is also an allegation

that he had threatened the child not to attend Court. Petitioner is the step-father of the victim

child and therefore, the alleged offence is one of domestic violence. Chances of the

Petitioner interfering with the victim and the other witnesses are also high. Therefore, the

learned High Court Judge has rightly cancelled the previous bail order and remanded the

Petitioner.

10. Petitioner has submitted that he is suffering from mental depression. However, the medical

report submitted as 'XT is dated 31.05.20 I 0, which is 10 years old. No recent medical

evidence is submitted to substantiate any medical condition that warrants intervention of this

Court. The reasons given by the learned High Court Judge for cancellation of the previous

bail order and remanding the Petitioner, override the circumstances urged by the Petitioner

for relief. I see no reason to interfere with the orders of the learned High Court Judge dated

03.05.2019 and 09.08.2019.

Application is dismissed.

I agree.
