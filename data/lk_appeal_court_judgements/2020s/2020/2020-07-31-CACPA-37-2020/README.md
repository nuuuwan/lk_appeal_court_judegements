SC for Respondents

08.07.2020 and 17.07.2020

31.07.2020

The Learned Counsel for the Accused - Petitioners (hereinafter referred as the 'Petitioners') made

submissions in order to issue formal notice to the Respondents purely on a question of Law, on an

order dated 11.03. 2020 made by the Provincial High Court of the Western Province, Holden in

Colombo dated I 1.03.2020. Having heard the submissions of the Learned Counsel for the

Petitioners and Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents, the analysis is made as

follows;

The 2nd Respondent, the former Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Corruption (hereinafter referred as the "Respondent"), has instituted proceedings before

the High Court of Colombo by way of an indictment, alleging commission of several offences by

the ISland the 2nd Accused Petitioners under the Bribery Act (as amended). The indictment

consisted of 4 7 charges against the said Accused Petitioners including the charges of soliciting and

accepting gratification. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners submitted to Court that the 151

Petitioner was holding the office as the Millitary Liason Officer to the Ministry of Defence of Sri

Lanka and the 2nd Accused Petitioner was holding the officer as the Chairman of the Avant Garde

Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd.

Upon service of notice by the High Court of Colombo, both Petitioners appeared before the

Learned High Court Judge and the indictment was read over to the Petitioners to which the

Petitioners pleaded not guilty to each and every charge separately and the matter was fixed for the

trial by the Learned High Court Judge.

On or about 14. 11.2019, the Counsel for the Petitioner raised a preliminary objection in open Court

that the purported indictment was not based on a valid direction by the Commissioners to institute

Page 4 of 8

proceedings in the High Court, where the Learned High Court Judge has rejected the preliminary

objection by his order dated 11.03.2020. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid order, the Petitioners

filed the instant revision application to set aside the impugned order.

l. Grounds of the Application

The Petitioners sought to issue formal notice to the Respondents where the Petitioners have stated

19 exceptional grounds in their Revision Application. However in order to issue notice, this Court

wishes to consider the most vital grounds listed as follows;

a. The said order of the Learned High Court Judge has not considered the objection raised by

the defence.

b. The High Court of Colombo has no jurisdiction to try and determine this case.

c. The said order of the Learned High Court Judge has failed to apply ratio decidendi of the

Anoma Po/walta v Jayawickrema case, SC Writ Application No.01l2011.

d. The said order of the Learned High Court Judge is a nullity. Hence it depends on an illegal

indictment without a valid direction from the Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Corruption.

e. The position that criminal proceedings cannot be instituted or continued against a person

based on strength of a nullity.

II. Legal Analysis

a. The Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo has

failed to address the objection raised as to the Jurisdiction of the Court to determine the

case.

Having considered the submissions of the parties in support of their respective positions, this court

would first analyse the primary contention which is the Jurisdiction of the Court. In order to

consider above, I wish to draw my attention to the Section II and Section 12 of the CIABOC Act

No. 19 of 1994. Section II which is the basis for the above objection reads as follows;

"Where Ihe malerial received by Ihe Commission in Ihe course of an invesligalion

conducled by it under Ihis Acl, discloses Ihe commission of an offence by any person under

the Bribery Acl or Ihe Declaration of Assels and Liabililies Law, No. I of 1975, Ihe

Commission shall direcl Ihe Direclor-General 10 inslilule criminal proceedings againsl

such person in Ihe appropriale cow'l and Ihe Direclor-General shall instilule proceedings

accordingly:

Provided however Ihal where Ihe malerial received by Ihe Commission in Ihe course of an

investigalion conducled by il discloses an offence under ParI II of Ihe Bribery Acl and

consisting of soliciling, accepling or offering, by any person, of a gral!/icalion which or

the value of which does nol exceed two Ihousand rupees, Ihe Commission shall direct the

instilulion 0.( proceedings againsl such person before Ihe Magistrale 's Court and where

such malerial discloses an offence under Ihat Part and consisting of soliciling, accepting,

or offering, by any person of any gralificalion which or Ihe value of which exceeds Iwo

thousand rupees, Ihe Commission shall direcl the inslilulion of proceedings against such

person in Ihe High COUl'l by indiclmenl".

Section II of the Act clearly stipulates that, upon investigation and finding of evidence, the

commission shall direct the Director General of the Bribery Commission to institute proceedings

in the appropriate Court depending on the monetary limitations as provided in the Act.

Section 12 of the Act vests the power to file indictment by the Director General of the Bribery

Commission. Section 12( I) of the CIABOC Act reads as follows;

Page 6 of 8

"Where proceedings are instituted in a High Court in pursuance of a directioll made by

the Commission under sec/ion II by an indictment signed by the Director-General, such

High Court shall receive such indiclment and shall have jurisdiction to try the offence

described in such indiclmenl in all re5pects as if such indictmenl were an indiclment

presented by the Allorney-Generalto such co uri. "

Section 12 makes it mandatory for the Director General to act upon the direction of the

Commission when proceedings are being instituted in a High Court. In the instant case the Counsel

for the Accused-Petitioners stated that, the decision of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo

has overruled the objection without considering the legal requirement in the Act.

b. The Learned Counsel for the Petitioners contended that the said order of the Learned High

Court Judge has failed to apply the ralio decidendi oftheAlloma Polwalta v Jayawickrema

case (SC Writ Application No.01l2011) and the High Court of Colombo has no

jurisdiction to try and determine the case hence it depends on an illegal indictment which

is based on an invalid direction from the Commission.

The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in exercising its highest and final judicial instance decided the

A/wma Polwatta v Jayawickrema case (supra) and established a legal principle associating with

Section I I of the Act. The Supreme Court in its analysis made it clear that, nevertheless the Act

does not make an express provision as to how the directive should be made but it is a mandatory

requirement on the part of the Commission to direct the Director General to institute proceedings.

Moreover in the Supreme Court case of Kesara Sellallayake V. Attorney General alld Allotller,

120101 1 S.L.R 149, held that even if the material facts of the case was different to the case in

hand, Hon. Shirani Bandaranayake, J made it crystal clear that a valid direction from the

Commission is mandatory in order to initiate proceedings by the Director General of the Bribery

Commission.

In light of the above discussed position, my attention is drawn to two important submissions made

by the Learned State Counsel for the Prosecution. At the stage of the trial the Learned State

Counsel in his submissions at Pg. 484 of the brief has referred to "ce6'~ef' and not "llWJZ'l"''',

Page 7 of 8

..

In addition to the above mentioned grounds we have considered the following grounds which was

placed before this Court. They are;

I. That there was no transparency.

2. That Counsel for the Respondents had misused the word advice instead of using directive

at the submissions made to the High Court.

3. The Learned High Court Judge had misapplied the provisions of Section 114 of the

Evidence Ordinance.

4. The Learned High Court Judge was erred in Law by holding that direction in terms of

Section II of the Act is a mere administrative rule.

5. No certificate was submitted along with the indictment like in other cases.

Further, it is observed by this Court that the documents pertaining to the direction was shown only

to the Learned High Court Judge and not the Petitioners. I don't think it is necessary to discuss the

aforesaid five grounds in detail at this preliminary stage of issuing notice.

In light of the above analysis, I am of the opinion that the Petitioners have established a prima

facie exceptional circumstances for this Court to issue notice.

Accordingly this Court issue notice to Respondents and stay further proceedings of the above

mentioned case No. HCB 25/2017 as prayed for in prayer (a) and (b) of the prayer of the petition.

I agree,
