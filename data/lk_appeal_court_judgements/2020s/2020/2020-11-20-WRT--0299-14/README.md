Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.

Counsel: Ashan Nanayakkara for the Petitioners.

Sumathi Dharmawardena, P.C., A.S.G., for

the 1st-3rd Respondents.

Hemasiri Withanachchi with Shantha

Karunadhara for the 4th-5th Respondents.

Decided on: 16.11.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners filed this application against the 1st Respondent

National Gem and Jewellery Authority and the 4th and 5th

Respondents, seeking to quash by a writ of certiorari the

decision marked P22 whereby the Chairman of the said

Authority cancelled the previous decision of the Director General

of the Authority marked P14 and made a fresh decision.

5

The pivotal argument of the Petitioners is that the decision P22

is ultra vires on the ground that according to the provisions of

the Gem and Jewellery Act, a dissatisfied party can prefer an

appeal against a decision of the Authority to the Secretary to the

Ministry and, from there, to the Supreme Court; but the

Authority has no power to review its own decisions, as has been

done in this case.

This argument is legally correct but factually incorrect in the

circumstances of this case. Let me explain.

The 4th and 5th Respondents applied for a gem-mining licence in

respect of the subject land. The 3rd and 4th Petitioners made a

claim upon their undivided shares in the land. After an inquiry,

the 1st Respondent Authority issued P14 whereby the 3rd and 4th

Petitioners were informed that pursuant to an inquiry held by

the Legal Branch of the Authority, the 3rd and 4th Petitioners

were each entitled to an undivided 1/20th share of the land, and

unless the 3rd and 4th Petitioners consented, the Authority would

allow the 4th and 5th Respondents to carry on with gem-mining

on the land conditionally.

I shall pause for a while to highlight that the aforesaid inquiry

was conducted by the Legal Branch of the Authority. The said

order is not a final order but a provisional one, as I will explain

below.

As the 3rd and 4th Petitioners did not consent, a conditional

Agreement marked P17(b) was executed between the Authority

on the one hand and the 4th and 5th Respondents on the other,

and a copy was sent to the 3rd and 4th Petitioners.

6

The fact that the decision P14 is provisional is amply clear by a

glance at the first paragraph of the said Agreement, which says

the 4th and 5th Respondents shall deposit the ground share for

the undivided 2/20th share in the name of the 3rd and 4th

Petitioners until a decision is taken after an inquiry. It is

significant to note that the printed portion of text which refers to

a court case being filed for vindication of rights in this regard

has been struck off, both in the said paragraph and in

paragraph 8 of the Agreement. This goes to show that P14 was

provisional pending a final order. I need not labour the point

because the Petitioners themselves admit so in paragraph 12 of

their written submissions dated 13.01.2020 when they say

Merely because P14 is not a final order, shall not help the 2nd

Respondent inasmuch as P14 was entered into after conducting a

proper inquiry.

P14 was not made after a formal inquiry. It appears to have

been made by the Legal Branch on prima facie facts pending a

final order by the Authority.

After the order P14, the inquiry continued with the participation

of the 3rd and 4th Petitioners.

It is thereafter the final order marked P22 was made. The final

decision is primarily that the 3rd and 4th Petitioners failed to

establish the rights they claim and hence should institute action

in an appropriate court to establish their rights within three

months of the decision.

The Petitioners rely on a District Court Judgment marked P11 to

make their claim to undivided rights. However, the 4th and 5th

Respondents have produced the documents marked X1 and X2

7

to show that the said District Court Judgment was set aside on

appeal and a retrial was ordered, and at the retrial the case was

settled, in that, out of the 1/4th share belonging to Sinduwa (i.e.

the predecessor in title of the Petitioners), only a 1/8th share was

to go to the heirs of Sinduwa. The Petitioners claim to undivided

rights is based on the said District Court Judgment. The

Petitioners have not disclosed the appeal decision and the

settlement arrived at thereafter. Nor do they dispute the above

facts before this Court.

The Petitioners challenge P22 not on the merits but on the legal

ground that the Authority cannot reverse or review its own

decision. This argument of the Petitioners is unsustainable in

the facts of this case as set out above. A court or tribunal can be

said to be functus officio only after the final order is made.

Interim or provisional orders made pending final determination

of the matter do not bring about the same result.

The Supreme Court Judgment marked P13 which the Petitioners

refer to is not relevant. That Judgment is with regard to a

dispute between the 4th and 5th Respondents on an earlier

application for a gem-mining licence, to which the Petitioners

were not parties. The present joint application for a gem-mining

licence made to the Authority by the 4th and 5th Respondents is

completely different, although the land appears to be the same.

The Petitioners are not entitled to the relief prayed for. The

application of the Petitioners is dismissed but without costs.
