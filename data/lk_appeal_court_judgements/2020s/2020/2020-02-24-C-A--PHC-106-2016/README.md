Decided on 12/02/2020

Hon. Justice A.L. Shiran Gooneratne

Petitioner-Appellant is absent and unrepresented.

The Registrar of this Court has listed this case for an order of Court in terms of Rule 3( 14) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure Rule 1990).

Perusal of journal entry dated 20/08/2019 and 14/01/2020 in the docket shows that the Appellant has failed to take steps to pursue this application.

Rule 3 (13) states that, it shall be the duty of the Petitioner to take such steps as may be necessary to prosecute his application with due diligence.

It is the view of this Court that the Petitioner is not interested in pursuing this application any further. In these circumstances the Court decides to reject the application.

Application rejected.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Hon. Justice Dr. Ruwan Fernando

I agree.
