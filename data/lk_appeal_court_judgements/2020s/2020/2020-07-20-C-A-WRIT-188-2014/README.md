Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The issue that arises for the determination of this Court is whether the

publication of the notice marked P68 by the 1st Respondent, the Divisional

Secretary, Kesbewa rescinding the notice issued in terms of Section 7 of the

Land Acquisition Act No. 9 of 1950, as amended (the Act), marked P48, and

thereby restoring the previous notice issued in terms of Section 7, marked

P12, subject to the amendment to P12 set out in the notice marked P69, is

ultra vires the powers of the 1st Respondent.

A consideration of the above issue requires this Court to set out in detail the

background facts, spanning over a period of fifteen years.

The Petitioner states that by virtue of Deed of Transfer No. 533 dated 4th

October 1990, he became the owner of a land in extent of 1A 3R 12P situated

in Pannipitiya. The said land is depicted in Plan No. 2185 dated 20th September

1980. The Petitioner states that prior to him purchasing the said land, his

predecessor in title had caused the said land to be re-surveyed and sub-divided

into twenty three lots, with Lot No. 23 serving as the road to Lot Nos. 1-10

situated on the north of the roadway and Lot Nos. 11 - 22 situated on the

south of the roadway, as depicted in Plan No. 2412 dated 14th July 1990. A

copy of the said Plan has been marked P2A. Although the Petitioner claims

that his predecessor in title prepared the said sub-division plan, it appears that

P2A was in fact prepared by the Petitioner, prior to purchasing the said land.1

Be that as it may, the Petitioner states that the said lots were not physically

demarcated on the ground nor had his predecessor in title sold any of the lots

separately. Thus, the Petitioner claims that at the time he purchased the said

1 Vide paragraph 1.2 of the petition filed by the Petitioner in CA (Writ) Application No. 2498/04, marked P29.

4

land, it had remained as one lot. After purchasing the said property in October

1990, the Petitioner had sold Lot Nos. 7, 9 15, and 17 depicted in Plan No.

2412 marked P2A to third parties (extent of the land sold aggregating to 98P),

together with the right of way over Lot No. 23.2 The Petitioner had continued

to be the owner of Lot Nos. 1-5, 8, 18 22, together with the right of access

over Lot No.23, of the Plan P2A.3

By a notice published in terms of Section 92 of the National Water Supply and

Drainage Board Act No. 2 of 1974 in Extraordinary Gazette No. 870/11 dated

10th May 1995, the Minister in charge of the National Water Supply and

Drainage Board had approved the acquisition of part of the aforementioned

land, in extent of 3R 28P. The said notice marked P4 recognises the Petitioner

as the person claiming the land. When one considers the boundaries of the

land identified to be acquired, as referred to in P4, and the shaded area in

P2A, it becomes clear that the land that is referred to in P4 are Lot Nos. 1-5,

17-22 and part of Lot No. 23 of P2A.

The Petitioner states that on 5th February 1996, he received under registered

post a notice dated 10th December 1995 issued under Section 2 of the Act,

annexed to the petition marked P3, in respect of a portion of land in extent of

3R 28P. There is no dispute that that the notices P3 and P4 have been issued

in respect of the same land namely Lot Nos. 1 5 and 17-22 and part of Lot

No. 23, of Plan No. 2412, marked P2A. It must be noted that Lot Nos. 8 and 16

of Plan No. 2412 was not affected by P3 and P4.

A notice under proviso (a) of Section 38 of the Act to take immediate

possession of the land, on the ground of urgency, had been published in

2 The Petitioner is not claiming any rights over Lot Nos. 6 and 16 of P2A vide paragraph 1.2 and 1.3 of P29. 3 Vide letter dated 14th March 1999 marked P13 sent by the Petitioner.

5

Extraordinary Gazette No. 978/5 dated 3rd June 1997, marked P6. By the time

P6 was issued, an Advance Tracing No. CO/KSB/96/21 marked P7 had been

prepared in November 1996 in respect of the land that was to be acquired. The

said Advance Tracing P7 consists of four lots numbered as 1 4, containing in

extent of 0.3651H. It appears that the division and demarcation of the land

into four lots had been done, for two reasons.

The first is that the roadway, i.e. Lot No. 23 in the Plan marked P2A, divided

the land claimed by the Petitioner into two. The said Lot No. 23 in P2A did not

belong to the Petitioner, as it was the roadway to the aforementioned Lots of

land that the Petitioner had alienated. As the Petitioner, and those who had

purchased lots from the Petitioner only had a right of way over Lot No.23 of

P2A, this was reflected by having that part of Lot No. 23 that was being

acquired, identified as a separate lot, namely Lot No. 2 in the Advance Tracing.

The second reason is that the Petitioner was not claiming any rights over Lot

No. 4 of P7 which appears to be Lot No. 17 in P2A which had been sold by

the Petitioner prior to acquisition proceedings commencing in 1995. Thus, the

Petitioner was claiming the land north of the roadway and south of the

roadway in P2A, and these two lots were accordingly depicted as Lot Nos. 1

and 3 in the Advance Tracing P7. This position is clearly reflected in the

column, ysuslus lshkakdf.A ku iy ,smskh on P7. Possession of the said land

had accordingly been taken over as four lots and the Petitioner does not seem

to have had any objection to the land to be acquired, not being depicted as

one Lot, in P7.

The notice in terms of Section 5 of the Act declaring that the said land is to be

acquired for a public purpose had been published in Extraordinary Gazette No.

999/5 dated 28th October 1997, marked P10, where the land had been

6

referred to with reference to the aforementioned Advance Tracing P7. The

extent of the land referred to in the said Notice is 0.3651H.

After P3 and P10 were issued, the Divisional Secretary appears to have

realized that acquiring part of Lot No. 23 in Plan No. 2412 would deprive access

to those who had purchased land from the Petitioner. It appears that the

Petitioner had agreed to provide a strip of land, having a width of 1.5m, and

situated to the south of Lot Nos. 17-22 of P2A, to enable the Pradeshiya

Sabha to combine this strip of land with the already existing road known as the

3rd Lane and thereby provide access to Lot Nos. 6-10, and 11-16 in Plan P2A.4

The roadway is set out in the Notice published under Section 24 of the

Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987, in Gazette No. 1008 dated 26th

December 1997, marked P4A.

The Petitioner states that in August 1998, the Surveyor General prepared

Preliminary Plan No. CO 7928, annexed to the petition marked P11 depicting

the land that was to be acquired as eleven lots numbered as Lot Nos. 1-11. The

total extent of the said eleven lots was 0.3697H.

Having examined P11, it must be noted that:

a) The part of the roadway i.e. Lot No. 23 in P2A which was to be

acquired, had been demarcated as four lots in P11, namely Lot Nos. 3, 4,

5 and 6;

b) The part of the land that was being claimed by a person other than the

Petitioner i.e. Lot No. 4 in P7 - had been demarcated as Lot No. 7 in

P11;

4 Vide paragraph 3 of P29.

7

c) The strip of land that the Petitioner had agreed to provide for the

alternate roadway had been demarcated as Lot No. 11 in P11;

d) Lot Nos. 6 and 8 in P11 was part of the roadway that was now going to

connect the 3rd Lane with those who had purchased Lot Nos. 6-10, and 11-

16 in Plan P2A from the Petitioner;

e) The Petitioner was entitled to claim ownership rights only with regard to

Lot Nos. 1, 2, 8, 9, 10 and 11, on P11.

The Divisional Secretary had thereafter published the Notice under Section 7 of

the Act, annexed to the petition marked P12 in Extraordinary Gazette No.

1066/4 dated 8th February 1999. P12 refers to the Preliminary Plan P11, and

contain details of the eleven lots depicted in P11, with the total extent of land

being 0.3697H. The Petitioner has responded to the said Notice P12 by his

letter dated 14th March 1999, marked P13 claiming compensation at the rate

of Rs. 75,000/- per perch, in respect of an extent of 3R 14.5P, being the

aggregate extent of Lot Nos. 1 6, and 8 11 of P11, which, according to the

Petitioner, was the total extent of the land belonging to him that was sought to

be acquired. As noted earlier, at this point of time, Lot Nos. 3 - 6 of P11

formed parts of the roadway in P2A (i.e. part of Lot No. 23) over which the

Petitioner only had a right of way.

The following paragraph in P13 sets out the claim of the Petitioner:

In addition to the composite claim in P13, by several letters dated 15th March

1999, the Petitioner had lodged separate claims in respect of Lot Nos. 1 6,

and 8 11 of P11.6

The Petitioner had participated at the Inquiry that was held on 26th March

1999 in terms of Section 9 of the Act. According to the notes of the Acquiring

Officer marked 1R23a 1R23i, the Petitioner had claimed as compensation,

a sum of Rs. 75,000 per perch as the land value, and a further sum of Rs. 5597

per perch as development costs.

The Acquiring Officer, acting in terms of Section 10(1)(a) of the Act had issued

his decision dated 28th August 1999 in respect of Lot Nos. 1, 2, and 8 - 11 of

P11 in favour of the Petitioner. The separate decisions made in respect of

each lot has been marked P16a P16f.

The Award under Section 17(1) of the Act had subsequently been made in

favour of the Petitioner, declaring that the Petitioner is entitled to a sum of Rs.

4,251,000 as compensation, in respect of Lot Nos. 1, 2, and 8 - 11 of P11.7

Dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation, the Petitioner, by a letter

dated 30th May 2000, marked P18, had appealed to the Board of Review,

stating as follows:

Thus, the Petitioners grievance at this stage was limited to the value

determined by the Valuation Department.

10

The inquiry under Section 9 in respect of Lot Nos. 3-6 of P11, which are the

lots, that were sought to be acquired from the roadway demarcated as Lot

Nos. 23 in P2A , had been held on 8th March 2000. It appears from the notes

of inquiry marked P22 that those persons who had purchased Lot Nos. 6-10,

and 11-16 in Plan P2A, had indicated that they have no further claim in

respect of Lot Nos. 3-6 in P11, as an alternate roadway had been provided by

combining Lot Nos. 6, 8 and 11 in P11 with the existing Pradeshiya Sabha

Road. The alternate roadway has been demarcated as Lot Nos. 6, 8, and 11 in

P11. After the conclusion of the inquiry, the Acquiring Officer had made an

Order in terms of Section 10(1)(a) of the Act on 9th November 2000, in favour

of the Petitioner, in respect of Lot Nos. 3-6 of P11.8 This Order had

subsequently been cancelled and replaced with an Order dated 31st March

2004, marked P27.

The Acquiring Officer however had not made any award for compensation in

respect of Lot Nos. 3 - 6 of P11 in terms of Section 17. For that reason, at the

request of the Petitioner, the Board of Review had laid by the appeal that had

been lodged by the Petitioner against the Award under Section 17(1) in respect

of Lot Nos. 1, 2, and 8 - 11 of P11, until the award was given by the Acquiring

Officer in respect of Lots 3, 4, 5 and 6 of P11.9

In December 2004, the Petitioner had filed CA (Writ) Application No. 2498/04,

seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the following documents:

a) The Preliminary Plan marked P11;

b) The Section 7 notice marked P12;

8 Vide P23. 9 Vide proceedings of the Board of Review held on 28th May 2002, marked P20.

11

c) The Section 9 inquiry proceedings held on 22nd March 1999;

d) The determinations made in terms of Section 10(1)(a) dated 28th August

1999, 9th November 2000 and 31st March 2004;

e) The award dated 16th May 2000 made in terms of Section 17 declaring

that compensation be paid to the Petitioner in respect of Lots 1, 2 and 8-

11 of P11;

I have examined the petition filed in the aforesaid application, marked P29,

and observe that the Petitioner had complained that P11 had been prepared

in callous disregard for the Petitioners interests and that P11 widely differs

from P7. The issue appears to be the depiction of the Petitioners land in P11

as several lots, as opposed to two lots in P7, which the Petitioner claims has

been done without any reason, and has adversely affected his rights. It is noted

that the Petitioner had no objection to his land being depicted as separate lots

in P7, but appears to have taken up issue with the further division of the said

lots in P11. It is on this basis that the Petitioner was seeking to quash Plan

P11, and the Section 7 notice P12. It is noted further that other than this

objection, the Petitioner does not appear to have had an issue with the extent

of the land depicted in the two plans.

When the above application was taken up for argument on 28th May 2008, the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner had informed Court that he is not pursuing

the relief sought by him to quash either P11 or the Section 7 notice, P12.

This Court, by its judgment delivered on 5th September 2008, marked P30 had

held as follows:

12

From the submissions made by Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned

Deputy Solicitor General and the perusal of the Departmental file, it

appears that the Divisional Secretary has made two orders in relation to

the determination under Section 10(1), one on 9th November 2000, and

the other on 31st March 2004. As the Divisional Secretary cannot make

two decisions in relation to one inquiry, this Court quashes the decision

made by the Divisional Secretary in relation to Section 10(1) Orders made

and published on 28th August 1999, 9th November 2000, 31st March 2004,

and the award under Section 17 dated 16th May 2000. The Court directs

the Divisional Secretary to hold a fresh inquiry under Section 9 based on

the notice published under Section 7 dated 8th February 1999 and after

giving notices to the relevant parties who made a claim in pursuance of

the above notice.

Even though the Petitioner had categorically stated to this Court in the earlier

application that he is no longer challenging the validity of either P11 or P12,

and even though the judgment of this Court was that the acquisition process

must recommence from Section 9 onwards based on the Section 7 notice

marked P12, the Petitioner had continued to agitate that proceeding with the

acquisition on the basis of separate lots as set out in P11, as opposed to three

Lots as set out in the Advance Tracing marked P7 is prejudicial to his rights.

The basis for this argument which is that great prejudice would be caused to

him by valuing the land as separate Lots, is reflected in the following paragraph

in letter dated 27th February 2009, marked P32:

Annexed to P32 was a sketch of a plan prepared by the Petitioner, showing

the amalgamation of Lot Nos. 1 - 5, 9 and 10 of P11 into a single lot marked

A. Thus, on the Petitioners own admission in P32, and as evidenced by the

Petitioners own sketch annexed thereto, the claim of the Petitioner was

limited to Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10 of P11. Very importantly, the Petitioner

had no issues either with the boundaries depicted in P11 or with the extent of

land that the Petitioner was entitled to, as set out in P11.

While the Petitioners request in P32 that his land be identified as one lot was

under consideration, the Acquiring Officer had made a determination on 30th

November 2009, under Section 10(1)(a) of the Act, accepting the Petitioners

claim in respect of Lots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10 of P11. The Petitioners claims

to the said lots crystallised only at this point of time. It is noted that Lot Nos. 6,

14

8 and 11 in P11 formed part of the roadway that was provided in lieu of the

part of Lot No. 23 in P2A.

The Secretary, Ministry of Land, by letter dated 30th September 2011, marked

P42 had informed the Acquiring Officer as follows:

Accordingly, the Surveyor General, on a request to survey marked P45, has

amalgamated Lot Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10 as depicted in P11, on P11

itself, and re-numbered the amalgamated lot as Lot No. 12. A copy of Plan No.

PP/CO/7928, depicting the said amendment effected on 19th December 2011

has been annexed to the petition marked P46. Thus, the Petitioners

grievance that the land acquired from him must be taken as one lot for the

purpose of calculating compensation has been given effect to by the

Respondents. As noted earlier, Lot No. 12 corresponds with Lot marked A in

the sketch provided by the Petitioner together with his letter P32.

The issue that culminated in this application begins with the above decision on

the part of the Respondents to accede to the request of the Petitioner to

depict the land acquired from him as one lot. Once the amended plan P46

15

was prepared in order to reflect the amalgamation of Lot Nos. 1 5, 9 and 10

as Lot No. 12, the Acquiring Officer had published a Section 7 notice in

Extraordinary Gazette No. 1745/34 dated 17th February 2012 marked P48, in

respect of Lot No. 12 of P46. Having done so, it had dawned on the

Respondents that on an application of the provisions of Section 45 of the Act,

compensation will have to be calculated as at the date of P48. The 1st

Respondent had corrected this error by firstly rescinding P48, by the notice

marked P68. He had thereafter published the following Notice, marked P69:

The general public is hereby informed that Notice under Section 7 of the

Land Acquisition Act No. 28 of 1964 that I have published in the Gazette

No. 1066/4 dated 2nd February 1999 of the Democratic Socialist Republic

of Sri Lanka will be amended as follows:

Description of the land to be acquired:

The allotment of land extent of 0.3059 hectare depicted as Lot No. 12 in

the Preliminary Plan NO. CO 7928 dated 19th December 2011 prepared by

the Surveyor General, situated in the village called Pelanwatte in the

Divisional Secretarys Division of Kesbewa in Colombo District of the

Western Province.

Name of land: Diganagodella Watta; Description: Open waste and land

water pool; Claimant: D.A.T.Athale, No. 363, Sirimavo Bandaranaike

Mawatha, Colombo 14; Extent: 0.3059 hectare. The effect of P69 was that it was only an amendment to the first Section 7

notice P12.

16

Dissatisfied by the rescission of P48 by P68, and the amendment made to

P12 by P69, the Petitioner filed this application, seeking inter alia the

following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash P68;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the Section 7 Notice dated 2nd August 1999

marked P12, and the amendment thereto, effected by the Notice dated

30th April 2014 marked P69;

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to hold an inquiry in

terms of Section 9 based on the Section 7 notice dated 17th February 2012

marked P48.

Prior to considering the argument of the Petitioner that the above course of

action is ultra vires the powers of the 1st Respondent, I would like to briefly set

out the procedure that must be followed when the State wishes to acquire a

land belonging to a private individual. The acquisition process commences with

Section 2(1), which reads as follows:

Where the Minister decides that land in any area is needed for any public

purpose, he may direct the acquiring officer of the district in which that

area lies to cause a notice in accordance with subsection (2) to be

exhibited in some conspicuous places in that area.

In terms of Section 2(3), any officer authorized by the Acquiring Officer may

carry out on any land in the area referred to in Section 2(1), the activity set out

in Section 2(3), and all other acts necessary, in order to investigate the

suitability of that land for the public purpose mentioned in the notice,

17

including the carrying out of surveys, checking the subsoil, demarcating

boundaries, etc.

Section 4(1) provides that where the Minister considers that a particular land is

suitable for a public purpose, he shall direct the acquiring officer to cause a

notice in accordance with Section 4(3) to be given to the owner or owners of

that land and to be exhibited in some conspicuous places on or near that land.

The notice under Section 4(3) shall state inter alia that the Government

intends to acquire that land for a public purpose, and that written objections

to the intended acquisition may be made to the Secretary to such Ministry as

shall be specified in the notice. In terms of Section 4(4), where a notice relating

to the intended acquisition is exhibited, and objections are made to the

Secretary by any persons interested in such land and within the time allowed,

the appropriate Secretary shall consider such objections, and make

recommendations to the Minister. In terms of Section 4(5) of the Act, the

Minister shall consider the said recommendations, and decide whether the

land should or should not be acquired under the Act.

The next step in the acquisition process is set out in Section 5, which reads as

follows:

(a) Where the Minister decides under subsection (5) of section 4 that a

particular land ... should be acquired under this Act, he shall make a

written declaration that such land ... is needed for a public purpose

and will be acquired under this Act, and shall direct the acquiring

officer of the district in which the land which is to be acquired ... is

situated to cause such declaration in the Sinhala, Tamil and English

languages to be published in the Gazette and exhibited in some

conspicuous places on or near that land.

18

(b) A declaration made under subsection (1) in respect of any land ...

shall be conclusive evidence that such land ... is needed for a public

purpose.

(c) The publication of a declaration under subsection (1) in the Gazette

shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that such declaration was

duly made.

Section 6 provides that once a declaration is made under Section 5, the

acquiring officer may cause a survey and a plan of that land to be made by the

Survey Department.10

Section 7(1) of the Act requires the Acquiring Officer to cause a notice in

accordance with Section 7(2) to be published in the Gazette and cause that

notice in those languages to be exhibited in some conspicuous places on or

near that land.

Section 7(2) reads as follows:

The notice referred to in subsection (1) shall-

(a) describe the land ... which is intended to be acquired;

(b) state that it is intended to acquire such land ... under this Act and

that claims for compensation for the acquisition of such land ... may

be made to the acquiring officer mentioned in the notice; and

10 See Hewawasam Gamage v. The Minister of Agriculture [76 NLR 25] - In my opinion section 6 of the Act makes it imperative and obligatory that the acquiring officer should, after the section 5 declaration, cause a survey and a plan of the land to be made, if a plan has not been made under section 2 (3) or if there is no other suitable plan available.

19

(c) direct every person interested in the land which is to be acquired ... to

appear, personally or by agent duly authorized in writing, before such

acquiring officer on a date and at a time and place specified in the

notice (such date not being earlier than the twenty first day after the

date on which the notice is to be exhibited for the first time on or

near the land), and, at least seven days before the date specified in

the notice, to notify in writing under the hand of that person or any

agent duly authorized as aforesaid to such acquiring officer the

nature of his interests in the land, the particulars of his claim for

compensation, the amount of compensation and the details of the

computation of such amount ....

The purpose of holding the Inquiry referred to in Section 7(2)(c) is set out in

Section 9(1) of the Act. In terms of Section 10(1), at the conclusion of an

inquiry held under Section 9, the acquiring officer holding the inquiry shall

either-

(a) make a decision on every claim made by any person to any right, title or

interest to, in or over the land which is to be acquired or over which a

servitude is to be acquired and on every such dispute as may have arisen

between any claimants as to any such right, title or interest, and give

notice of his decision to the claimant or to each of the parties to the

dispute; or

(b) refer the claim or dispute for determination as provided for in section

10(2).

Section 17(1) of the Act reads as follows:

20

The acquiring officer who holds an inquiry under section 9 shall, as soon

as may be after his decisions under section 10 have become final as

provided in that section or after the final determination of any reference

made under that section and subject to the other provisions of this

section, make an award under his hand determining-

(a) the persons who are entitled to compensation in respect of the land

or servitude which is to be acquired;

(b) the nature of the interests of those persons in the land which is to be

acquired or over which the servitude is to be acquired;

(c) the total amount of the claims for compensation for the acquisition

of the land or servitude;

(d) the amount of the compensation which in his opinion should, in

accordance with the provisions of Part VI of this Act, be allowed for

such acquisition; and

(e) the apportionment of the compensation among those persons.

Such acquiring officer shall give written notice of the award to the persons

who are entitled to compensation according to the award

In terms of Section 38, once an award is made under Section 17, and unless

possession of the land has already been taken over previously on the ground of

urgency, as provided for in proviso (a) to Section 38, the Minister may, by an

Order published in the Gazette, direct the Acquiring Officer to take possession

of the land, for and on behalf of the State, thus bringing the process of

acquisition to a closure.

21

Part VI of the Act provides for the assessment of the compensation that is

payable to a person whose land has been acquired. Section 45(1) of the Act

reads as follows:

For the purposes of this Act the market value of a land in respect of which

a notice under Section 7 has been published shall, subject as hereinafter

provided, be the amount which the land might be expected to have

realized if sold by a willing seller in the open market as a separate entity

on the date of publication of that notice in the Gazette:

Having gone through the lengthy and time consuming procedures set out in

Sections 2, 4, 5 and 6 of the Act, the first step that the Acquiring Officer takes

in calling for claims to ownership and compensation is set out in Section 7, and

hence appears to be the rationale for fixing the date of such notice for the

determination of the value.

The cumulative effect of Sections 7, 17 and 45 is that while a person whose

land has been acquired in terms of the Act is entitled to receive compensation

calculated at market value, the market value shall be determined as at the

date on which the Section 7 notice is published in the Gazette. Hence, the

importance of the date of publication of the Section 7 notice, and the reason

for this application.

I shall now consider the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner, which was that the land in respect of which claims were called by

the first Section 7 notice P12, has now changed, and that the second Section

7 notice P48 reflects the said change, and hence, the decision of the

Respondents to revert to P12 is ultra vires the powers of the 1st Respondent

in terms of the Act.

22

The purpose of issuing a notice under Section 7 is three fold the first is to

manifest the intention of the State to acquire the land that is referred to in the

said notice. The second is to direct every person interested in the land that is

to be acquired to notify in writing to the Acquiring Officer the nature of his

interests in the land, the particulars of his claim for compensation, the

amount of compensation and the details thereof. The third is to direct such

persons to appear before the Acquiring Officer on a date specified in such

notice, on which date, the inquiry contemplated by Section 9 of the Act would

take place.

There is no dispute that the first Section 7 notice P12 complied with the

above requirements. While the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that the Petitioner has not, and is not objecting to the acquisition,

what is important here is that the intention of the State to acquire the land as

declared by P12 has been given effect to, and possession of the land has been

taken over by the State in July 1997. The Petitioner has admitted that he

handed over the land to the Respondents on 21st July 1997 vide P9 - and has

admitted that the land has already been acquired vide P13. Thus, for the

purposes of the Act, acquisition of the land belonging to the Petitioner has

been completed as far back as in July 1997.

In response to the first Section 7 notice P12, the Petitioner had lodged his

claim in respect of the land that is claimed by him11. I have already noted the

manner in which the claim of the Petitioner evolved over a period of time and

crystallized into a claim for Lot Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10 of P11.

11 Vide P13 and P15a P15j.

23

After the judgment of this Court was delivered in CA (Writ) Application No.

2498/2004 on 5th September 2008 directing that proceedings be continued

from the point of the first Section 7 notice P12, the Respondents have taken

steps to conduct the Section 9 inquiry in respect of Lot Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and

10, in extent of 0.3059H. The Petitioner has not raised any objection with

regard to the extent of land that he is claiming. The Acquiring Officer had

thereafter proceeded to make a determination in terms of Section 10(1)(a)

vide P37.

After the amalgamation of Lot Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10 into Lot No. 12, the

Acquiring Officer has made a further determination in terms of Section 10(1)(a)

on 6th June 2012 vide P53 - with the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner submitting during the course of his oral submissions that the

Petitioners claim is now limited to Lot No. 12 in P46.

Having considered the totality of the above material, the following matters are

clear:

a) P12 was published with regard to Lot Nos. 1 11 depicted in Plan No.

7928 marked P11;

b) The Petitioners claim has now crystallized in respect of Lot Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4,

5, 9 and 10 of P11;

c) At the Petitioners request, the said Lot Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10 of P11

were amalgamated into Lot No. 12, as depicted in the amendment made

on P11 itself vide P46;

24

d) The necessity to amend the first Section 7 notice P12 arose only because

the Respondents decided to accede to the request of the Petitioner that

the land claimed by him be shown as one lot, and for no other reason;

e) Even so, the amendment that was required to P12, was only a simple

reference to Lot No. 12 in lieu of Lot Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10;

f) The extent of the land belonging to the Petitioner that was to be

acquired, the boundaries of the overall land, and the nature of the land

that the Petitioner is claiming as depicted in P11 has not changed in

P46.

I am therefore of the view that:

(a) As the description of the land, the extent of the land and the overall

boundaries of the land claimed by the Petitioner have not changed;

(b) As Lot No. 12 is the precise area of land that the Petitioner himself

identified as Lot A in the sketch annexed to his letter marked P32;

(b) As the Petitioners entitlement to claim compensation in respect of the

land claimed by him remains intact,

the correct course of action that the Acquiring Officer was required to take was

to publish an amendment to the first Section 7 notice.

As stated by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the

Civil Service,12 by 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the

decision maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision

making power and must give effect to it. Section 45(1) clearly lays down that

12 1985 AC 374.

25

compensation must be calculated as at the date on which the notice under

Section 7 is published. Given the factual circumstances of this application, the

Acquiring Officer clearly erred, and in fact acted wrongfully and irrationally

when he published a fresh Section 7 notice (vide P48) when a valid Section 7

notice P12 already existed. The error having been pointed out to him, it is my

view that not only was it within the power of the Acquiring Officer, but he was

also required in terms of the Act to cancel the second Section 7 notice (vide

P48), and take steps to publish an amendment to the first Section 7 notice, by

substituting Lot No. 12 for Lot Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 and 10. Such a decision is

neither ultra vires nor illegal, and is a manifestation of the provisions of Section

7.

It is appropriate to reiterate the fact that the Petitioner challenged the first

Section 7 notice P12 in the previous application filed before this Court,13 and

at the argument stage of that application, had informed this Court that he is no

longer challenging the said Section 7 notice. By its judgment,14 this Court had

directed the Divisional Secretary to hold a fresh inquiry under Section 9 based

on the notice published under Section 7 dated 8th February 1999. I am of the

view that the 1st Respondent must act in terms of the said judgment, subject to

the amendment effected thereto by P69 to reflect the request of the

Petitioner.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that:

(a) The 1st Respondent has not acted ultra vires the powers conferred on him

by the Act by rescinding the second Section 7 notice marked P48 (by

P68);

13 Vide P29 and P30. 14 Annexed to P30.

26

(b) The 1st Respondent has not acted ultra vires the powers conferred on him

by amending the first Section 7 notice marked P12, by P69.

Before I conclude, I must state that the Petitioner, knowing fully well that the

amalgamation of Lot Nos. 1-5, 9 and 10 to Lot No. 12 took place solely to

satisfy his request, and knowing fully well that the Acquiring Officer had made

an error when he published P46, has sought to take advantage of such error.

That is not the conduct that is expected of a person who is seeking a

discretionary remedy. In Fernando, Conservator General of Forests and two

others vs. Timberlake International Pvt. Ltd. and another15, the Supreme

Court, having held that the conduct of an applicant seeking Writs of Certiorari

and Mandamus is of great relevance because such Writs, being prerogative

remedies, are not issued as of right, and are dependent on the discretion of

Court, stated that, It is trite law that any person invoking the discretionary

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal for obtaining prerogative relief, has a duty to

show uberrimae fides or ultimate good faith,....

As observed by the Supreme Court in Namunukula Plantations Limited vs

Minister of Lands and Others,16 If any party invoking the discretionary

jurisdiction of a court of law is found wanting in the discharge of its duty to

disclose all material facts, or is shown to have attempted to pollute the pure

stream of justice, the Court not only has the right but a duty to deny relief to

such person. I am of the view that such duty commences prior to the

institution of action, and that the Petitioner has not come before this Court

with clean hands.

27

In the above circumstances, I see no merit in this application. The application

of the Petitioner is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
