o I. The Suspect-Petitioner (Petitioner) had been produced before the Embilipitiya Magistrate with

two other suspects on 14.08.20 19 by the Officer in Charge of Kuttigala Police station, alleging

that they had committed an offence under sections 8( I), 8(2), and 9 of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act). Taking the

facts reported into consideration, the learned Magistrate had remanded the Petitioner.

02. In terms of section 10(1) of the Act, such suspect can be enlarged on bail only by the Court of

Appeal under exceptional circumstances. The instant application is preferred in terms of the above

provision by the Petitioner seeking bail.

03. As exceptional circumstances, the learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the Petitioner

had been in remand for nearly 13 months and the Hon. Attorney General had failed to file the

indictment. In this regard, learned counsel referred to the decided case of Dachchaini V. The

Attorney General CA PHC 5512005 (DB) 06.10.2005 and case of Ediriweera V. Attorney

General 2006 1 Sri L.R. 25.

04. Learned counsel further submitted that the Petitioner is the sole bread winner of his family,

including his wife and 3 children.

05. Learned State counsel for the Respondent submitted that the circumstances urged by the

Petitioner are common to all suspects in remand and not exceptional. They have received the IB

extracts only in June 2020 and the delay was due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The victim of the

instant case and the substantive matter has not given evidence yet, and if bail is granted to the

Petitioner, the victim would hesitate to testify in Court due to fear of getting assaulted by the

Petitioner. It was also submitted that the victim had received several injuries due to the assault by

the Petitioner.

06. In the substantive case, it is alleged that the Petitioner Kandambige Chandana with others had

stolen 7 bunches of bananas from the victim. On that complaint the Petitioner was produced

before the learned Magistrate on 03.08.2019 and was released on bail. On the same day, it is

alleged that the Petitioner with the other suspects had assaulted the victim stating that he made the

complaint to the police.

07. The objective of the Act is to set out, uphold and enforce the rights and entitlements of victims of

crime and witnesses and to provide for a mechanism to promote, protect, enforce and exercise

such rights and entitlements, in terms of section 2 of the Act.

08. It is alleged that the assault on the victim was because he made a complaint regarding the theft of

bananas. The victim had sustained several injuries. Further, after the complaint of assault was

made, it took about 10 days for the pol ice to arrest the Petitioner as he and the other suspects had

been evading arrest. The victim is yet to give evidence in the substantive case. It is the bounded

duty of Court to protect the victim from any kind of interference or harassment not only until he

testifies in Court, but also thereafter. Hence, the circumstances mentioned above would override

3

the circumstances urged by the Petitioner as exceptional for granting of bail, and thus cannot be

taken as exceptional to grant bail.

Application for bail is refused.

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J

I agree.
