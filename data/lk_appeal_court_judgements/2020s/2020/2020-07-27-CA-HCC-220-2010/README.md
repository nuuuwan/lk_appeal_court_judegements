The accused appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Emhilipitiya for committing an offence punishable under section 364 (2) E of the Penal Code as amended by Act No 22 of 1995.

After trial, the accused appellant was convicted and sentenced to Five years rigorous imprisonment, a fine of Rs 5000/- and in default, six months of simple imprisonment, and ordered to pay the victim a sum of Rs 50000/- as compensation and in default, six months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence the appellant has preferred this appeal.

The following grounds of appeal were urged by the counsel for the appellant as mitigating against the maintenance of the conviction; that there is no legal adoption of evidence as per section 48 of the Judicature Act by the learned trial Judge who delivered the judgment; the learned judge did not have the benefit of the demeanor of the

2

victim and as such the appellant was denied a fair trial; as there are infirmities in the evidence of the victim it was unsafe to rely on her uncorroborated evidence; no evaluation of the material contradictions; the medical evidence is un supportive of the evidence of the victim.

First, I will consider the submission of the counsel that the trial judge has not adopted the proceedings formally under section 48 of the Judicature act.

Section 48 of the Judicature acts provides as follows;

Any action, prosecution, proceeding , matter on any inquiry preliminary to the committal for trial or othenuise has been instituted or is pending can be continued before a successor of the judge in the case of death, sickness, resignation, removal from office, absence from Sri Lanka or other disability ( of the judge who heard the case / inquiry)

1. To act on the evidence already recorded by his predecessor or 2. To act on the evidence partly recorded by the predecessor and partly recorded by him- or 3. If he thinks fit to re summon the witnesses and commence the proceedings afresh.

Out of the three Judges who heard the instant case, two judges have recorded that the proceedings before the predecessor judge is adopted and the learned judge who delivered the judgment has not so recorded.

Evidence has commenced before the learned judge on 26.08.2009 and the accused had been present and represented by counsel on that day. The registrar of the High Court has marked the Birth Certificate of the victim and the case for the prosecution has concluded, and the accused was explained his rights. On a subsequent date the accused has given his statement from the dock and the evidence of the witness for the defence has been led. No

3

application has been made on behalf of the accused to recall a witness or to commence proceedings afresh.

Section 48 does not stipulate a formal written statement to the effect that proceedings are adopted. In the instant case proceedings have continued without any application to recall any witness. Thus, it is safe to infer that the proceedings were duly adopted.

In Millaniya Ranminige Daniel vs Attorney General CA 164/2007 decided on 2l.07 .2010 it was held by Justice W. L. Ranjith Silva ........ under section 48 of the Judicature act, the succeeding judge has the power to act on the evidence already recorded and thus the rule laid down in section 48 is in favour of an adoption of the proceedings by the succeeding judge. Even in the absence of a positive record of the fact of the adoption of the evidence, the fact that the succeeding judge had continued with the proceedings without any objection from either party would tantamount to an adoption of proceedings within the meaning of section 48 of the Judicature act ... "

In the more recent Judgement of Justice Prasanna Jayawardena in SC Appeal No. SC/CHC/37/2013 Central Finance Company PLC Vs. Sappani Chandrasekera and another.

It is stated that section 48 vests a discretion in the succeeding judge in a civil trial to decide which of the three lines of action referred

to in section 48 should be followed when a case heard by a predecessor judge is taken over. It is stated,

"However, the discretion vested in the succeeding judge to follow one of the aforesaid three lines of action must be exercised reasonably since whenever the law vests a discretion in a Court, it is implicit that such discretion has to be exercised reasonably. When a succeeding judge is weighing how he should exercise the discretion vested in him by section 48 and which line of action envisaged in section 48 should be chosen by him, his decision will

4

depend on the facts and circumstances of the case before him."

Justice Jayawardena has quoted with approval the following passage from Justice Salam's decision in; AG vs. SIRIWARDANE 2009 2 SLR 337 at pg. 354-355 who observed,

"But the application of section 48 may vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. Since it is a discretion vested in court, it should have been exercised diligently for it is said that a person in whom is vested a discretion must exercise his discretion upon reasonable grounds. A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so - he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reasons direct. He must act reasonably (Roberts us. Hapwood (8) at 613)."

Justice Jayawardene in that case has further decided that the succeeding judge should have given the parties an opportunity to be heard with regard to which course of action outlined in Section 48 should be followed.

However in the instant case it can be clearly seen that the evidence of the last of the prosecution witness has been led before the learned judge who delivered the judgement. Thereafter several dates have been obtained before the rights of the accused was explained. The accused who was represented by counsel had ample opportunity to demand that the witnesses be re-summoned and re-heard, which he failed to do.

It is also clear that section 48 gave the judge discretion. "To act on the evidence already recorded by his predecessor" which the learned judge has correctly followed and proceeded to prepare and deliver judgement.

In the circumstances of the instant case, I cannot agree with the submission of the counsel of the appellant that the non-adoption of the proceedings formally in writing, was a violation of a fair trial or that there was a miscarriage of justice due to that reason.

With regard to the incident, according to the prosecution, the victim is a girl of 15 years of age who was living with the parents and one of her brothers, right opposite the house of the appellant. On 9.12.2002 PW I, the victim has returned home around noon from a tuition class to find the front door of her house locked and she was seated outside when the appellant had come and inquired whether his wife has come there, to which she has replied in the negative and has said there was no one at home.

Thereafter, the victim has gone to the back of the house where the kitchen is located and finding that it was unlocked was serving herself some food when the appellant has come there and asked for a few matchsticks. When she went to get it, the appellant has pushed her to the floor of the kitchen holding her hands tightly, and closing her mouth with his hand has removed her clothes and has engaged in sexual intercourse. At one point she is alleged to have fainted and has regained consciousness when the appellant was about to leave the kitchen. When she was getting up from the ground, from the open kitchen door, she has seen the wife of the appellant coming on the road. She has noticed blood on her underskirt and something liquid around her genitals when she stood up.

As per pages 59 and 79 of the brief she has told the wife of the appellant about the incident, but not all the details. She has washed the clothes she was wearing. When her mother came around 5 pm that evening she has informed that she was raped by the appellant, who in turn has informed the father. When they were getting ready to go to the police station which was about 5 miles away, the father has told that it was too late to go.

PW 1 and the mother have gone to the Police station the following day but were turned back by the police as they were busy attending a function. Finally, on 11.12.2002 a complaint has been

6

lodged and the victim was referred to the medical examiner who has examined her the following day being the 12.12.2002, that is on the third day after the alleged incident. The Victim has stated that the Grama Sewaka was informed of this incident before going to the police station in page 84 of the brief.

PW 5, Dr Randombage has evidenced that according to the short history given by the victim when she was examined at the Government Hospital Sooriyaweva on the 12.12.2002, that her neighbor R.R.

Chandraratne has raped her on 9.12.2002 around 12.15 pm. He has observed two tears in the vagina which he has estimated to be about three days old. He has not observed any other external injury and he has not seen any redness or bleeding in the vagina area and that the victim did not complain of any pain to the touch which is usually not expected after 3 days of such an incident. In page 45 he has answered as follows;

Therefore, his evidence has been that the short history given to him is compatible with his observations and confirmed that a penile penetration has taken place.

PW 3 is the mother of the victim who testified that when she was returning home around 5 pm after attending a "Samurdhi" matter , about 20 meters away from her home, she has met the wife

7

of the appellant who has cried and told about an incident which involved PW 1 her daughter and when she came home, the victim has informed that she was raped by the appellant. When they were getting ready to go the police station that evening itself, was advised by her husband not to go as it was late evening.

The victim and the mother have given a plausible explanation regarding the delay in making a statement to the police. It is regrettable that the police without attending to the complaint straight away acted in an irresponsible manner, by which fact the medical examination was delayed. However, it is evident that PW 1 has complained at the earliest opportunity which presented itself therefore, the test of spontaneity and contemporaneity is in her favour.

In the Dock Statement of the accused he has admitted going to the victims house while one of his relatives was at home, (who gave evidence on behalf of the accused,) to ask for a few match sticks to light the fire to make tea. He has stated he spent about 10 minutes there, and when returning, his wife has seen him and scolded him for going to that house. According to him there was animosity between his wife and the victim's family, although he did not have any issue with them.

The witness for the accused has testified that he was at the appellant's house when the appellant went to the neighbour's to borrow some match sticks and it took about 10 minutes for him to return and that he heard the wife of the appellant scolding the appellant for going to the neighbour's house.

I shall now consider whether the evidence of the victim is credible. The victim is a minor known to the appellant and his family who are her immediate neighbours. The defence attempted to state that there was animosity between the wife of the appellant and the victim's family, the basis being the brother of the victim having an affair or a relationship with the wife of the appellant.

8

It was admitted by the victim and her mother, that at one time the two families were not good with each other, however, in the recent times they were having a cordial relationship. (pages 113, 104, and

112 of the brief).

This evidence has not been assailed. This fact can be further supported by the behavior of the appellant himself as according to the victim, the appellant has inquired whether his wife is at the victim's house when he first made conversation with her, which was not challenged in cross examination.

The evidence of the mother of the victim was that she got to know about the incident from the wife of the appellant and according to the victim she has told the wife of the appellant about the incident albeit, not all the details, soon after the incident. The appellant's dock statement and his witness's evidence have to be considered in that background, The reason for the wife scolding the appellant can be inferred from the above evidence.

The defense was not able to establish that the letter that was shown to the victim when cross examined, was written by her. The defense also failed to establish that the victim was involved with either Chamara (an unknown person) or Tharanga (a friend of the brother). It was apparent that mentioning of these two young males was an attempt to cast a doubt in the credibility of the evidence of the victim.

10

However, the appellant failed to cast a doubt In the evidence of the prosecutrix.

The counsel's contention that the evidence of the victim is unsupportive of any corroborative evidence is based on very immaterial facts, for example the mothers silence about the blood stains, the clothes the victim was wearing not been a production, the police being told the accused entered from the rear side door.

The counsel for the appellant contended that the learned trial judge has failed to evaluate the contradictions. The contradictions marked as VI to V6 are not material contradictions that go to the root of the case and they have not created a doubt about the credibility of the witness at all nor has it caused any injustice to the appellant.

In Premasiri Vs The Queen 77 NLR 86 The Court of Criminal Appeal held 'in a charge of rape it is proper for a jury to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant only when such evidence is of such character as to convince the jury that she is speaking the truth. '

In Sunil and another vs The Attorney General 1986 1 SLR 230 it was held 'Corroboration is only required and or afforded if the witness requiring corroboration is otherwise credible. If the evidence of the witness requiring corroboration is not credible, his testimony should be rejected and the accused appel/ant acquitted. Seeking corroboration of a witnesses' evidence should not be used as a process of inducing beliefin such evidence, where such evidence is not credible.

It is very dangerous to act on uncorroborated testimony of a woman victim of a sex offence but if the evidence is convincing such evidence could be acted even in the absence of corroboration.

In Sumanasena vs Attorney General [ 1999] 3 Sri LR 137 it was held that evidence must not be counted but weighed and the

evidence of a single witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a court of law.

11

'.

When considering the totality of the evidence, it is my considered view that the evidence of the prosecutrix is credible, cogent and impressive and that her evidence is corroborated by the evidence of the mother and the medical evidence.

The evidence for the defense was not strong enough to create a doubt in the case for the prosecution and I am of the opinion that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, I see no reason to interfere with the learned trial judge's conviction.

With regard to the sentence, section 364 (2) E stipulates a minimum mandatory sentence of 10 years. The learned State Counsel has stated that the sentence is manifestly inadequate and contrary to law. Considering that the victim was a girl under the age of 16 at the time of the incident, we are mindful of the fact of the requirement of imposing the mandatory sentence imposed by the law. Accordingly, we set aside the sentence of Five years rigorous imprisonment imposed and substitute 10 years rigorous imprisonment to be entered against the accused. The rest of the sentence to remain unchanged.

Subject to the above variation of the sentence, the appeal IS dismissed.
