The instant order concerns an application made by the suspect

Petitioner in terms of Section 10 (1) (a) of the Assistance to and

Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No.4 of 2015.

j---':-:--------------------_._-------------------------,------------ -------------------------------------------------j , I I . I I I I , I I I I I I I I I ! The Petitioner has b{;en arrested and produced before the !

I I I I ! Magistrate's Court of Mullaitivu under case No. B/1269/2018 on

I I I I I 11.11.2018 on an allegation made by Sivagnanavel Janani, that the

Petitioner together with her daughter Fathima Mapasha on 15.09.2018

verbally threatened by saying;

" ... why you caused the arrest of my Imran, do you know who we

are? We are Muslim. Do you know what we will do you for this?"

Case No. B 1022/2018 was instituted in respect of a house

robbery and theft of jewellery and causing hurt, identifying a suspect

named Imrankhan who is the Son-in-law of the Petitioner, who was

arrested on 15.09.2018 for the substantive matter.

The Petitioner together with her daughter are alleged to have

threatened the complainant and causing intimidation regarding the

Magistrate's Court Case B 1022/2018 which is an offence under Section

8 (1) (a) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act.

In support of the application for bail, the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner submitted the following exceptional grounds upon which she

could be enlarged on bail;

a. The statements of the complainant, the circumstances and the

evidence referred to in the "B" report are not sufficient to maintain

a case under the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime

and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015.

: 3 I I I I I 1 ______ ----------------------------------------------- ___________________________________________________________ _

i---~~------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------ ------~ , I , i

I , I

I I I I I I I I i b. The alleged incident is said to have been committed on 15.09.2018

but reported to Court on 11.11.2018 and this unreasonable delay

itself creates a reasonable doubt on the incident.

c. As the threat is a verbal threat, ingredients to frame charges under

Section 8 (1) of Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime

and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015 and Section 434 and 483 read

with Section 32 of the Penal code is unlikely.

d. The B Report is malicious and fabricated on a false complaint.

e. The Petitioner is often falling sick and suffering from the long

period of incarceration at the Prison.

It is further submitted that; the Petitioner is 60 years old who has

resettled with the husband in Mullaitivu from Puttalam after 20 years

in refugee camps since the forceful eviction from her home town by the

LTTE in 1990; that she has been in remand for the last one year; that

the son- in-law Imrankhan and another suspect M.lbrahim have been

granted bail in the substantive matter; that she was arrested on 11th of

November 2018, for the alleged offence committed on 15th of September

2018, which is two months later, however there is not any reference of

threatening or intimidation by the petitioner in the first complaint of

the virtual complainant according to the B report or subsequent further

report ( emphasis added),there is no reference whatsoever could be

found to the effect of threatening of witnesses as alleged until 22nd of

September 2018 in the said case B/I022/ Magistrate's Court of

j-----.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 . , , . : : , , , , . , , , , , , , , i Mullaitivu; the Police made a reference of threatening the witness by an ' , , , oral submission only on 22nd of September 2018 in order to object for

bail after the Counsel made the application for bail and brought it to

the notice of the court; the alleged incident of threatening the witnesses

reported by Police to the Magistrate is based on false allegation and is a

fabricated story; the said allegations of threatening the said witness was

filed against her only to keep the Suspect in remand for a longer period

of time; her incarceration has caused severe pain of mind, hardship to

the petitioner and her family.

The State Counsel has vehemently objected to bail at the inquiry,

mainly based on the Petitioner's daughter evading arrest and the fact

that she cannot be found by the Police. In the objections it is stated that

the petitioner together with her daughter Fathima Mapasha have

threatened and intimidated the complainant and in the investigation

in to the complaint of Sivagnanavel Janani on the statement of her

sister Siva Abhirami the identity of the Petitioner was revealed which

has been corroborated by the statement of P. Thawamani.

The contention of the Petitioner is that the daughter is living with

the suspect Imrankhan who is her husband in Thalaimannar and that

the petitioner has no contact with the daughter and do not know of her

whereabouts. Further, as the petitioner is in remand since 11.11.2018

she has no way of contacting Fathima Mapasha her daughter.

According to the respondent although several police messages

have been sent to the Thalaimannar Police, Fathima Mapasha has not

been arrested. This fact is borne out by several B reports in case No. B

5 , , , 1 _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ J

1269/18 reporting that the main suspect has to be taken in to custody.

It is the duty of the Police to take appropriate steps to take Fathima

Mapasha into custody which they have failed to do for over two years.

There is not sufficient material before Court to establish that the Police

have taken adequate measures to apprehend the main suspect Fathima

Mapasha. In the circumstances, it is difficult to comprehend the

position of the Attorney General's Department objecting to bail on the

basis that the main suspect Fathima Mapasha is not apprehended.

On a perusal of the complaint of Sivagnanavel Janani and the

statements of the two other Witnesses which precipitated the '8' report

that paved way to remand the Petitioner, it is clearly seen that none of

the witnesses have stated that the Petitioner personally threatened the

alleged Victim Sivagnanavel Janani.

It is yet to be proved in Court that the Petitioner was in the

company of the daughter Fathima Mapasha who is alleged to have

verbally threatened Sivagnanavel Janani the complainant.

Section 5(3) of the said Act identifies the entitlements of witnesses.

Section 7 had imposed a duty on Courts and other related agencies" ... to

recognize, protect and promote" such rights and entitlements afforded

to the witnesses.

Section 5 (3) reads thus;

"A witness shall be entitled to protection against any

real or possible harm, threat, intimidation, reprisal or

I 6 I I I I I 1 _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ J

i-----;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------j , t t " t t,

relation resulting from such witness having provided

information or lodged a complaint or made a

statement to any law enforcement authority or for

having provided any testimony in any Court or before

a Commission or for instituting legal proceedings,

pertaining to the commission of an offence or for the

infringement of a fundamental right or for a violation

of a human right, by any person."

Further, Section 8(1)(b) states that any person;

" ..... Voluntarily causes hurt to a victim of crime or a

witness, with the intention of causing such victim of

crime or witness to refrain from lodging a complaint

against such person with a law enforcement

authority, or testifying at any judicial or quasi-

judicial proceedings or to compel such victim of crime

to withdraw a complaint lodged or legal action

instituted against such person, or in relation for a

statement made or testimony provided by such

victim of crime or witness in any court of law or

before a Commission, against such person. . ...

Commits an offence .... "

When considering the spirit of the legislature it is obvious that

this law was enacted for the benefit of the Victims of Crime and

Witnesses.

1 1 1 ! But there have been instances, where there are questions whether 1 1 ! the law enforcement officers are following and adopting best practices

relating to the protection of victims, or whether the Act is abused by

their negligence or incompetence.

In the instant matter, there is only the B reports informing courts

that they have yet to take Fathima Mapasha in to custody. This has

gone on for over one and a half years and during that period the

Petitioner, mother of Fathima Mapasha is languishing is remand

custody. There is no mention whatsoever of the Petitioner threatening

the victim, the only reference is a witness identifying her as one of the

women who were looking for Sivagnanavel Janani's house, and

Sivagnanavel Janani's sister's statement that she knew them when they

were in Karachchikudiiruppu. But here also it is not clear whether

Abhirani identified the Petitioner correctly and sufficiently.

Be that as it may, from the avru1able material no direct

involvement has been established so far of the Petitioner threatening

the alleged victim. The lethargic attitude of the police is seen by their

own conduct where they have been unable to take Fathima Mapasha in

to custody who is said to be the main suspect, for over one and a half

years.

In the circumstances it is my considered opmlOn that ends of

justice will be met by granting bail to the petitioner on the following

conditions.
