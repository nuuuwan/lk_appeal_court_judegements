Ranjan Suwandaratne f'lF for 1st & 2nd Defendant-Appellant

Aroosha de Silva for Substituted -Plaintiff-Respondent.

for the Substituted-Plaintiff-Respondent on 25.11.2019 ..

27/09/2019

16/11/2020

The now deceased Plaintiff (hereinafter sometimes referred to as Plaintiff), filed the original case

in the District Court of Kalutara against the 1st and 2nd Defendant - Appellants (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as Defendants) praying inter alia,

(A) a judgment and decree granting a permanent injunction permanently prohibiting the

Appellants from forcibly removing the structures

(8) a Directive Order, directing the Appellants to grant approvals in terms of the

Recommendation as stated in the plaint.

At the first instant the District Court issued Notices of Interim Injunction against the Defendants.

In response, the Defendants filed their Pro>4- and moved for a date to file their Objections to

issuance of Interim Injunction against them. Despite obtaining two dates to file Objections to the

said issuance of Interim Injunction against the Defendants, owing to the lack of legal

representation on behalf of the Defendants, the District Court issued the Interim Injunction

against the Defendants as prayed by the Plaintiff.

Pertaining to the aforesaid failure to file their Answer on the very first day they appear before

the Court, fixed the case for ex-parte Trial against them on 30-09-1998. Thereafter an ex-parte

decree was entered against the Defendants and was duly served on the Defendants.

In response to the aforementioned ex-parte trial, the Appellants, on 29-11-1999, filed a

purported Application under sec. 86 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code to vacate the same. The said

purported Application comprised of a Petition and an Affidavit by the Secretary of the 2nd

Defendant - Appellant.

In the said application, the grounds upon which the Defendants based their case were;

1. Summons were tendered with the Plaint AND summons were not served on the

Defendants.

2. The Court has no power to issue a permanent injunction against them to deprive them

from exercising their powers vested with the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No: 15 of 1987.

Page 5 of7

However, the Defendants filed a motion purportedly dated 02-12-1999 through which, the

Defendants informed the Court that "by an oversight, the Defendants could not file the affidavit

in support of the said Petition under sec. 86 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code and therefore the

Affidavit with receipt pertaining to the stamp duty being paid is filed hereby."

The deceased Plaintiff filed her Objections to the said Application of the Defendants mainly on

two grounds

(a) The Defendants have filed their Application out of time for the reason of no valid and

stamp duty paid to the Petition and Affidavit that was filed within 14 days

(b) That there is no need of summons to be served as the Defendants any way came to Court

by filing a proxy.

The Learned District Judge on 17-08-2000, dismissed the said application of the Defendants, after

having considered both of the grounds taken up by the Defendants.

The Defendants preferred this Final Appeal against the said Order. In the said Final Appeal as

well, the Defendants raised the aforesaid grounds.

The defence taken up by the now deceased Plaintiff was that, by way of a motion dated

16.10.2000, he informed the District Court that this Final Appeal, under sec.86 (2) of the Civil

Procedure Code the application was filed not within 14 days (including Sundays and all public

holidays) from the service of the said ex-parte decree entered, which was on 15-11-1999. Even

though the said purported Application was comprised with a Petition and an Affidavit by the

Secretary of the 2nd Defendant-Appellant, both purportedly dated 26-11-1999, as admitted by

the Defendants themselves, the said documents were not stamp duty paid. Since as admitted by

the Defendants themselves, there was no valid stamp duty paid Petition and Affidavit, the

Defendants were forced to file a fresh Affidavit with stamp duty paid. The said subsequent

Affidavit, this time by the 1st Defendant-Appellant was tendered to the Court on 02.12.1999.

Consequently, even though the Defendants might have filed a Petition and Affidavit without

stamp duty being paid within 14 days from the date of the service of the said ex-parte decree,

the subsequent affidavit with stamp duty paid, was filed 17 days after the service of the said

ex-parte decree.

Therefore, it is very clear that the Learned District Judge was correct in deciding the Application

of the Defendants is time barred.

It is my view that Even though the Defendants maintained that summons were tendered with

the Plaint, it is evident from the case record itself that the summons were tendered at the time

of filing of the Plaint. It is my observation that there shall not be other evidence remaining in the

Page 6 of 7

case record to support the fact of 'tendering summons with the Plaint', as the said summons

tendered have been duly served on the Defendants.

Therefore, the alleged claim by the Defendants that summons were not tendered is baseless.

It is also my observation that this Final Appeal is also filed out time, stipulated as this Final Appeal

had been lodged on 16.10 ; 200~ . The said date is the 61st day from the date of judgement as the

calculation of the 60' days has to be done without any exclusion of days including the date of the

Order and the date of the tendering of the Appeal.

Therefore, this appeal should be dismissed with costs and that the judgment of the Learned

District Court Judge is affirmed.
