Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Plaintiffs filed this action in the District Court of Ratnapura

against the Defendant, the Land Reform Commission, seeking a

declaration of title to the Plaintiffs undivided rights to the land

described in the schedule to the plaint, damages in a sum of

Rs.10,000/= and a permanent injunction preventing the

Defendant from disturbing the possession of the Plaintiffs of the

land. The Defendant filed answer seeking dismissal of the

Plaintiffs action. After trial, the learned District Judge

dismissed the Plaintiffs action with costs. Hence this appeal by

the Plaintiffs.

Under section 18 of the Land Reform Law, Robert George

Delgoda, together with two others, made statutory declarations

in respect of certain lands including the land in suit.

The Defendant inter alia published Notices under section 29 of

the Land Reform Law directing interested parties to make claims

for compensation. Several persons had made claims and, as

there was a dispute regarding entitlement to compensation, the

3

matter was referred to the District Court under section 30 of the

Land Reform Law. After an inquiry, the District Court by V9

ordered compensation to be paid only to Robert George Delgoda.

Giving evidence at the trial, the 1st Plaintiff stated that although

he was aware of the section 29 Notice published in the Gazette,

he did not think it fit to make a claim for compensation, as his

rights to the land were unaffected by the statutory declaration

made by Robert George Delgoda.

There are two schedules to the plaint describing two lands, but

it is not clear from the plaint and the issues which land the

Plaintiffs claim undivided rights to. I presume the Plaintiffs

claim undivided rights to the land described in the 1st schedule,

which is a portion of the larger land described in the 2nd

schedule to the plaint. The land has not been properly

described by way of a Plan, except by a reference in the 2nd

schedule to No.27AO, which is only a Lot number without a

Plan number.

The larger land, known as Delgoda Nindagama, is about 600

amunam in extent, which is, supposedly, about 1500 acres. Of

this land, the Plaintiffs are claiming undivided rights to a portion

in extent of 143 acres and 5 perches. No Plan has been

produced by the Plaintiffs to identify the said portion, but they

state it has been produced by the Defendant as part of V2. V2 is

a photocopy of a portion of a Plan found at page 222 of the Brief

and does not satisfy the requirement in this regard.

In any event, the Plaintiffs do not say they are the only co-

owners of the land known as Delgoda Nindagama. As seen from

4

the Gazette marked V4, 520 acres of Delgoda Nindagama was

vested in the Land Reform Commission upon the statutory

declaration of Robert George Delgoda.

The 1st Plaintiff unequivocally admits in his evidence that Robert

George Delgoda was also a co-owner of this land. Then, upon

his statutory declaration at least, Robert George Delgodas rights

would have passed to the Land Reform Commission, thereby

making the Land Reform Commission also a co-owner of the

land. In addition to the Plaintiffs and the Land Reform

Commission, there should be other co-owners of the land.

The claim of the Plaintiffs that they have acquired prescriptive

title to the land (presumably described in the 1st schedule to the

plaint) has been dismissed by the District Judge. The Plaintiffs

do not canvass that finding of the District Judge in this appeal.

Against this backdrop, can the Plaintiffs file an action for

declaration of title in order for the Court to decide their

undivided rights to the land described in the 1st schedule to the

plaint?

The Plaintiffs also state the Defendant is in unlawful possession

of the land. One co-owner cannot object to another co-owner

possessing the common property.

In the unique facts and circumstances of this case, in my view,

the Plaintiffs should have filed a partition action, not a

declaration of title action. I see no prohibition for them to do so

even now.

5

The main contention of the Plaintiffs is the Land Reform

Commission could not have acted on the declaration made by

Robert George Delgoda, without conducting a proper

investigation. This is a declaration of title action, not a writ

application. The Plaintiffs may challenge the administrative

decisions of the Land Reform Commission in a properly

constituted writ application, if they so desire.

The dismissal of the Plaintiffs action by the District Judge is, in

my view, flawless. The appeal is dismissed with costs.
