Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner, having been appointed as a teacher in 1979, joined Class III of

the Sri Lanka Education Administrative Service in November 1999, and was

promoted to Class II of that Service in 2014. The Petitioner states that the

Government introduced a scheme in 2013 whereby Public Servants were

permitted to import a motor vehicle or purchase a locally assembled motor

vehicle at a concessionary duty rate (the Scheme). The Petitioner has annexed

to the petition marked P8a, Circular No. 1/2013 dated 2nd August 2013 issued

by the Ministry of Finance and Planning, which sets out the terms and

conditions applicable to the said Scheme.

The Petitioner, being eligible to import a motor vehicle in terms of P8a had

submitted an application to the 1st Respondent, the Secretary, Ministry of

Education, Eastern Province, on 7th April 2014.1 The Petitioner states that by a

letter dated 19th May 2014, the 3rd Respondent, Deputy Chief Secretary

(Finance), Eastern Province, prior to processing the application of the

Petitioner, had inquired from the 1st Respondent whether there are any

disciplinary inquiries pending against the Petitioner. In reply, 1st Respondent

had informed by a letter dated 19th June 2014, annexed to the petition marked

P13 that a disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner is pending at the Ministry

of Education. The 3rd Respondent had accordingly informed the 1st Respondent

by letter dated 14th July 2014 annexed to the petition marked P14 that the

Petitioners application cannot be processed as there is a disciplinary inquiry

pending against the Petitioner. This position has been conveyed to the

Petitioner by the 1st Respondent, by letter dated 28th July 2014, annexed to the

petition marked P15.

1 Vide application annexed to the petition marked P7.

Dissatisfied by the said decision, the Petitioner filed this application on 28th

April 2015. By an amended petition filed on 27th November 2015, the

Petitioner has sought inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st and/or 6th Respondent from

issuing a charge sheet to the Petitioner;

(b) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision contained in P13, P14 and

P15 not to issue the Petitioner with a vehicle permit in terms of P8a;

(c) A Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st, 3rd or the 4th Respondents to issue

the Petitioner a vehicle permit in terms of P8a.

The aforementioned Writ of Prohibition has been sought to prevent the charge

sheet relating to the disciplinary action referred to in P13 P15, from being

served on the Petitioner. By a motion filed on 18th September 2019, the

Attorney-at-Law for the Petitioner had submitted that the disciplinary inquiry

against the Petitioner has been concluded and that he has filed an appeal

against the findings of the Disciplinary Authority with the Administrative

Appeals Tribunal. The Respondents have filed a copy of the Order of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal delivered on 8th October 2019, which has

upheld the findings of the Inquiry Officer and the punishments imposed on the

Petitioner by the Disciplinary Authority. Thus, the necessity to consider the

Writ of Prohibition does not arise.

While Section 01.01 of Circular P8a sets out the list of persons who are

eligible to apply for a permit, and the number of active years of service that

each category of persons must have prior to the date of the application in

order to be eligible to apply for the concession, paragraph 01.02 of P8a

contains the list of items that disqualify a person from applying under the said

5

Scheme. The disqualification that has given rise to this application is found at

Paragraph 01.02(v) and reads as follows:

hus ks,Odrsfhl=g jsreoaOj jskh l%shdudra.hla wdrusN lr oekg tu l%shdudra.h

wjika lr fkdue;s ks,Odrska2

The word, l%shdudra.h means procedure, and therefore, the requirement in

P8a is that a person against whom disciplinary procedures have commenced

is not eligible to be issued a permit under the Scheme.3 The question that

needs to be determined in this application therefore is whether any

disciplinary procedures had commenced against the Petitioner at the time

P15 was issued to the Petitioner.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner is equating the commencement of

disciplinary procedure against the Petitioner to the issuance of a charge sheet

followed by the commencement of a formal disciplinary inquiry. There is no

dispute that a charge sheet had not been served on the Petitioner at the time

the letter P15 was issued on the Petitioner, and even at the time this

application was filed. The primary argument of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner therefore was that his application for the vehicle permit could not

have been refused as no formal disciplinary inquiry had been initiated against

him at the time P15 was issued.

The position of the Respondents however is that at the time P15 was issued

to the Petitioner, a preliminary investigation had been held against the

Petitioner and a decision had been taken to initiate disciplinary action against

the Petitioner, and that such a decision would satisfy the requirements set out

in P8a. The learned Senior State Counsel has also submitted that P8a does

2 P8a has been issued only in Sinhala and Tamil. 3 See English Sinhala Dictionary by Professor G.P. Malalasekera [2004, 4th Edition] page 788.

not make reference to disciplinary action being commenced nor is the

reference to a commencement of a formal disciplinary action. His submission

was that applicants are disqualified from claiming benefits under the said

Scheme if steps have been initiated with a view to taking disciplinary action, or

in other words, the disciplinary procedures set out in the Establishments Code

have been set in motion.

The Respondents have submitted that a preliminary investigation into several

acts of misconduct said to have been committed by the Petitioner had been

investigated by a Committee appointed by the 4th Respondent, the Chief

Secretary of the Eastern Province in 2012, and that the Committee had

submitted its report, together with a draft charge sheet to the 4th Respondent,

who in turn had forwarded the said charge sheet to the 1st Respondent, by a

letter dated 7th December 2012.4

The said charge sheet against the Petitioner contained 24 charges. The

Petitioner was subsequently found guilty by the Inquiry Officer of the following

charges:

Charge No. I

1. That while in Government Service, without approval of the Secretary of

the Ministry, the Petitioner had worked as Sainthamaruthu reporter of

the Lake House Institution, reporter of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting

Corporation and a freelance reporter of Navamany newspaper,

thereby violating Section 1:3 and 1:4 of Chapter XXX of the

Establishments Code.

4 This letter has been marked R7A.

7

Charge No. III

2. That while working in the Government service the Petitioner has kept

the office key without approval and thereby interrupted the duty of the

office employees.

Charge No. VII

3. That while working in the Government service, the Petitioner had sent a

letter addressed to the principal, Janab M.H. Sediq Oraf by using the

name of a terrorist movement (LTTE) and threatening him attempted to

create problems in administration of the school.

Charge No. XXIV

4. That the Petitioner had committed all of the above offences or some of

them or any of them, by which the Petitioner had dishonoured the

Government Service.

Having received the aforementioned report and the draft charge sheet, the 1st

Respondent had thereafter sent the following letter dated 20th December

2012, marked R7B to the Secretary, Ministry of Education:

Thus, as at 7th December 2012:

(a) There was a recommendation that disciplinary action must be initiated

against the Petitioner;

(b) There was a decision that the Petitioner must be issued with a charge

sheet in respect of the above acts of misconduct.

What followed thereafter demonstrates bureaucratic red tape at its best, with

the Ministry of Education, and the Public Service Commission taking 35 months

to decide who is the Disciplinary Authority of the Petitioner.5 As a result, the

charge sheet that eventually led to the aforementioned decision of the

Administrative Appeals Tribunal, was issued to the Petitioner only in 2016,

even though a decision had been taken to issue the Petitioner with a charge

sheet 16 months before the Petitioner made the application P7 under the

said Scheme.

While the Ministry of Education was taking its time deciding who has the

power to issue the Petitioner with a charge sheet, the Petitioner had been

involved in a further incident with the Principal, Zahira College, Kalmunai on

29th October 2013, resulting in assault and destruction of property. The

Petitioner had been transferred after this incident, but as he failed to report to

the new place of work, the Petitioner had been served with a vacation of post

notice, which had subsequently been withdrawn on an appeal filed by the

Petitioner, subject to a warning.

5 Vide documents marked R7C to R7X.

It is in this background that I must consider whether the decision of the 3rd

Respondent not to process the application of the Petitioner is ultra vires and

unreasonable.

Chapter XLVIII of the Establishments Code contains the Rules of Disciplinary

Procedure applicable to the Petitioner. While Part 3 contains the Procedure

for disciplinary action by the Cabinet of Ministers, Parts 4, 5 and 6 contain the

Procedure for disciplinary action by the Public Service Commission, by a

Secretary to a Ministry holding delegated powers from the Public Service

Commission, and Procedure for disciplinary action by a Head of Department or

other Officer holding delegated authority from the Public Service Commission,

respectively.

Section 6:2 of Chapter XLVIII reads as follows:

Where a Head of Department or other Public Officer holding delegated

authority in terms of sub-section 6:1 above contemplates disciplinary action

against an officer in a category of officers coming within his disciplinary

authority, he should hold a preliminary investigation himself or cause to be

made a preliminary investigation by another officer or a group of officers

appointed by him.6

Similar provision is found in paragraphs 3:1, 4:1 and 5:2 of the Establishments

Code.

Section 13:1 of Chapter XLVIII sets out what is meant by a preliminary

investigation, and reads as follows:

6 Section 6:2 reads as follows: Wla; 6(1 Wm j.ka;sh u.ska mjrk ,o n,h ,enq fomdra;fuSka;= m%Odkhl= iy fjk;a ks,Orhl+ jsiska ;u jskh n,Odrs;ajh hg;g jefgk ks,Or ldKavhlg wh;a ks,Orhl=g jsreoaOj jskhdkql=,j l%shd lsrsug woyia lr we;s jsgl" wod< jskh n,Orhdu jsiska fyda Uyq jsiska m;alrkq ,nk fjk;a ks,Orhl= fyda ks,Or lKavdhula fyda u.ska fyda uq,sl jsuraYkhla meje;ajsh hq;=h'

10

A preliminary investigation is that which is conducted by a disciplinary

authority or Head of Institution...to find facts as are necessary to ascertain

the truth of a suspicion or information that an act of misconduct has been

committed by an officer or several officers and to find out and report

whether there are, prima facie, sufficient material and evidence to prefer

charges and take disciplinary action against the officer/officers under

suspicion.7

In terms of Section 6:3, If a prima-facie case is disclosed against the officer by

the preliminary investigation held in terms of sub-section 6:2 above, the

relevant Disciplinary Authority should prepare a charge sheet and duly issue it

on the officer. However, in the case of an officer in the Combined Services, the

Head of the Department in which the officer works should forward, without

delay, the draft charge sheet and other documents to the Director of Combined

Services.8 Similar provision is found in paragraphs 3:2, 4:2, and 5:3 thereof.

Section 13:12 reads as follows:

After the completion of the preliminary investigation, the officer

conducting the investigation should forward the report of the preliminary

investigation together with the statements obtained from the relevant

parties, documents, etc. taken into his custody and his observations and

recommendations to the appropriate authority. The officer conducting the 7 Section 13:1 reads as follows: lsishus rPfha ks,Orfhla fyda ks,Orhka lSm fofkl+ fyda jsiska jsIudpdrhla isoq lr ;sfns o hkak ms<sn|j ielhla we;s jq jsg fyda f;dr;=re ,o jydu fyda ta ms<sn|j kshu ;;= fy,sorjs lr .ekSug wjYH uQ,sl idOl fidhd .ekSu;a" ielhg md;%j isgsk ks,Orhdg fyda ks,Orhkag fyda jsreoaOj fpdaokd bosrsm;a lr jskhdkql+,j l%shd lsrSug ;rus ne,q ne,aug fmkS hk wdldrfha m%udKh;a lreKq yd idlaIs fidhd.; yels o hkak fidhd .ekSu i|ydka jskh n,Orhl= fyda wdh;k m%Odkshl= fyda fjk;a ksis n,Orhl= fyda jsiska o fkdtfia kus tlS n,Orhkaf.a ksfhda. u; ta i|yd m;a lrkq ,enq ks,Orhl= jsiska fyda ks,Or lusgqjla jsiska o ta ms<snoj fidhd n,d jdra;d lsrSu uQ,sl jsuraYkhla kus fjS' 8 Section 6.3 reads as follows: Wla; 6(2 Wm j.ka;sh m%ldrj ks,Orhdg jsreoaOj fpdaokd ke.Sug ;rus m%udKj;a fya;= idOl we;s nj tu uQ,sl jsuraYkh u.ska ne,Q ne,aug fmkS hkafka kus" wod< jskh n,Orhd jsiska" fpdaokd m;%hla ilia lr wod< ks,Orhd fj; jsOsu;aj ksl=;a l, hq;=h' tfia jqj o taldnoaO fiajdjkag wh;a ks,Orhl= iusnkaOfhka jk l,ays ks,Orhd fiajh lrk fomdra;fuSka;= m%Odkshd jsiska fpdaokd flgqusm; we;= wfkl=;a ,shjs,s taldnoaO fiajd wOHCIjrhd fj; fkdmudju bosrsm;a l< hq;=h'

11

preliminary investigation should also prepare a draft charge sheet...and

forward it to the relevant authority in the event that sufficient material is

disclosed that call for disciplinary action against the suspect officer or

officers.

The fact that the Preliminary Investigation forms part of the disciplinary

procedures set out in the Establishments Code is evident from the provisions

of Section 1:4 of Chapter XLVIII, which reads as follows:

If a formal disciplinary inquiry has been held, the proceedings should be

arranged in chronological order and the various stages of the proceedings

such as relevant material of the preliminary investigation, charges,

answers thereto, the inquiry proceedings, findings and the disciplinary

orders flagged or labeled separately.

The material that has been placed before this Court by the Respondents

demonstrate that as at 7th December 2012, the preliminary investigation had

been concluded, and based on its findings, a decision had been taken to issue a

charge sheet to the Petitioner. The 1st Respondent was personally aware of the

said decision as he is the person who had written R7B, and when the 3rd

Respondent inquired from him whether there were any disciplinary

proceedings pending against the Petitioner, it was his duty to set out the

accurate factual position.9

A public servant is not entitled to import a motor vehicle on concessionary

duty terms as of right. The Circular P8a, and all circulars similar to it, before

and after, afforded a public servant a privilege, which could only be used once

in five years, or such other time period that the Government may decide, and

9 Vide P13.

12

on terms and conditions determined by the Government. P8a makes it clear

that an officer against whom disciplinary procedures have been initiated (jskh

l%shdudra.hla wdrusN lr) is not eligible to receive the said privilege. Similar

provision is found in the Minutes of Pension,10 whereas suspension of salary

increments, promotions, foreign trips and scholarships would require a formal

charge sheet to have been issued.11

It is noted that P8a has been replaced with Circular No. 01/2016 dated 14th

July 2016 marked 8R2. Clause 2.5 thereof reads as follows:

wdh;k ix.%yfha jsOs jsOdkhka wkqj fyda tA tA wdhd;khkays ndjs;hg .kq

,nk md,k jsOsjsOdk fyda kS;s rS;s wkqj uQ,sl jsuraYkhla fyda jsOsu;a jskh

mrSlaIkhla wdrusN lr oekg tu l%shdudra.h wjika lr fkdue;s ks,Odrska.

It is therefore my view that, unless the Disciplinary Authority acts in terms of

Section 2512 or Sections 31:5 and 31:6 of Chapter XLVIII13:

a) A preliminary investigation is the first step that would be taken where

commencement of disciplinary action is contemplated;

b) The purpose of a preliminary investigation is to ascertain if there is

sufficient material to initiate disciplinary action;

c) Whether disciplinary action could be initiated would be known by the

report submitted by the Officer conducting the preliminary investigation.

10 Vide Section 12(1) where disciplinary proceedings are pending or contemplated at the time of retirement, the pension may be withheld or reduced. 11 Vide Section 14:12 of Chapter XLVIII - When a formal charge sheet has been issued against an officer for disciplinary action against him, granting him salary increments, promotions, foreign trips and scholarship, study leave with pay, loans and advances, no pay leave locally and abroad and secondments should forthwith be suspended until the final outcome of the inquiry. 12 Summary Disciplinary Procedure. 13 Interdiction pending a preliminary investigation.

13

d) If the preliminary investigation does not disclose any material that

warrants the initiation of disciplinary action, the matter obviously ends

there.

e) If disciplinary action is called for on the material that is disclosed during

the preliminary investigation, the Officer conducting the investigation is

required to submit a draft charge sheet together with his report;

f) The issuance of the charge sheet on the officer concerned would follow

thereafter, followed by the holding of a formal disciplinary inquiry.

g) The preliminary investigation, the report of the Officer conducting the

preliminary investigation, the charge sheet, the inquiry and the

disciplinary order forms part of the disciplinary procedure set out in the

Establishments Code for the taking of disciplinary action against a public

servant.

Thus, by the time P15 was issued, the disciplinary procedure against the

Petitioner had commenced, thereby bringing the aforementioned steps that

had been taken within the limitation contained in P8a, namely hus

ks,Odrsfhl=g jsreoaOj jskh l%shdudra.hla wdrusN lr oekg tu l%shdudra.h wjika

lr fkdue;s ks,Odrska.

In the circumstances of this case, it is my view that the decision of the

Respondents to withhold the issuance of the permit is within the provisions of

paragraph 01.02(v) of the Circular P8a, and is therefore not ultra vires the

powers of the 3rd Respondent. It is not a decision which is so outrageous in its

14

defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who

had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.14

The application of the Petitioner is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
