When this application was taken up for argument on 26th July 2019, the

learned Counsel appearing for all parties moved that this Court pronounce its

judgment upon a consideration of the material placed before Court and the

written submissions that would be tendered on behalf of the parties.

By an amended petition dated 31st July 2017, the Petitioner has sought the

following relief:

2

Website Copy Website Copy

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash two grants issued to the 2nd Respondent

under the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance/

b) A Writ of Mandamus to compel the 3rd and 4 th Respondents to issue a

certificate of life interest in the name of the Petitioner.

This application gives rise to issues arising from the alienation of State land

under the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance (the Ordinance).

Hence, it would be appropriate to consider at the outset the relevant

provisions of the said Ordinance. Section 19(1) provides that alienation of State

land to any person under the provisions of the Ordinance shall be effected in

the manner provided in the said Ordinance.2 Section 19(2) of the Ordinance

specifies that "every such person shall in the first instance receive a permit

authorising him to occupy the land."

Section 19(4) of the Ordinance proceeds to state as follows:

"A permit holder shall be issued a grant in respect of the land of which he

is in occupation:

(a) where he has paid all sums which he is required to pay under sub-

section (2);

1 Copies of the said grants have been annexed to the petition marked 'P3' and 'P3A'.

2 The procedure to be followed in selecting persons to whom State land shall be alienated is set out in Sections 20 - 24 of the Ordinance.

b) where he has complied with all the other conditions specified in

the Schedule to the permit; and

c) where he has been in occupation oj, and fully developed, to the

satisfaction of the Government Agent

(i) irrigated land, for a period of three years, or

(ii) high land, for a period of one year: ... /1

A plain reading of Sections 19(2) and 19(4) would demonstrate that the

following conditions must be satisfied prior to a grant being issued in respect

of a State land under the Ordinance:

1) A permit must be issued in the first instance in respect of the said land;

2) The permit holder must be in occupation of the said land;

3) The permit holder must develop the said land, to the satisfaction of the

Divisional Secretary;

4) The permit holder must comply with all the other conditions specified in

the permit.

It is therefore evident that in terms of Section 19(4), a grant is issued to a

person to whom a permit has already been issued in respect of the land for

4

Website Copy Website Copy

which the grant is given. It is thus clear that the issuing of a grant is a

continuation of the permit issued in the first instance, and hence in terms of

the Ordinance a grant cannot be issued in the first instance.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The State had issued a permit under the provisions of the Ordinance to

R.M.Punchibanda in respect of a paddy land in extent of 2A 3R 12P, and a high

land in extent of 2A OR 19P. The said permit had been cancelled in 1967 in

terms of Section 110 of the Ordinance. According to the land ledger relating to

the above lands maintained at the Moneragala Land Registry, an extract of

which has been annexed to the petition marked 'Pl', a decision had been

taken in 1968 to give the said land to R.M. Piyadasa Bandara, who is (a) the

husband of the 2nd Respondent, (b) the father of the 1st Respondent, and (c)

the father-in-law of the Petitioner.

It is the position of the 3rd Respondent, the Divisional Secretary of

Siyambalanduwa that even though a decision had been taken to provide the

above land to Piyadasa Bandara, and such fact is recorded in the ledger 'Pl', a

permit in terms of Section 19(2) of the Ordinance was never issued to him. The

Petitioner and the 1st and 2nd Respondents too concur with the said position.3

Piyadasa Bandara passed away on 1st September 1987, survived by his spouse,

and at least two children, namely the 1st Respondent and another son,

Sumanasiri Ratnayake, the husband of the Petitioner.

Chapter VII of the Ordinance contain provisions relating to succession to land

alienated by way of a permit or a grant issued in terms of the Ordinance. In

terms of Section 48A(1)' the spouse of a permit holder may succeed to the land

alienated to the permit holder upon the death of the permit holder. Section

48B(1) contains similar provisions relating to grants. Section 49 contains

provisions relating to succession by a person who has been nominated as a

successor by the permit holder or the grantee, in terms of Section 56 of the

Ordinance. What is important to note however is that all these provisions

apply to situations where a permit or a grant has in fact been issued, whereas

in the present application, at the time of his death, a permit in respect of the

State land in question had not been issued to Piyadasa Bandara.

Be that as it may, the State has proceeded on the basis that Piyadasa Bandara

was eligible to be issued a permit at the time of his death. There is no dispute

among the parties on this fact. The 3rd Respondent states that soon after the

death of Piyadasa Bandara, the State had recognised the entitlement of the 2nd

Respondent to succeed to the said land as a 'life interest holder'. This is

reflected in the ledger marked 'Pl'. Thus, it is clear to this Court that the State

had continued to recognise the fact that Piyadasa Bandara was eligible to

receive a permit, and that the 2nd Respondent was entitled to succeed to the

said land by virtue of being the spouse of Piyadasa Bandara, and not on her

own right. The 2nd Respondent had thereafter nominated Sumanasiri

Ratnayake as her successor, which fact too has been recorded in the ledger

'Pl' on 5th January 1988, and is confirmed by a letter of the same date issued

by the Assistant Land Commissioner, Moneragala, annexed to the petition

marked 'P2'. The Petitioner too admits in her letter dated 9th February 2012

6

Website Copy Website Copy

annexed to the petition marked 'P4' that her husband had been nominated by

the 2nd Respondent as the successor. It is not in dispute that the said

nomination is contrary to the provisions of Section 4BA(2)(b) of the Ordinance,

as a life interest holder cannot nominate a successor.

The 3rd Respondent states that on 4th December 1990, the State had issued a

permit to the 2nd Respondent, and that the 2nd Respondent had nominated

Sumanasiri Ratnayake and the 1st Respondent as her successors, which fact too

is registered in the ledger 'Pi'. The 3rd Respondent states however that the 2nd

Respondent was not entitled to be issued a permit, and hence was not entitled

to nominate a successor. This Court must observe that irrespective of the

entitlement of the 2nd Respondent to a permit by virtue of being the spouse of

Piyadasa Bandara, she could not have nominated a successor, in view of the

provisions of Section 4BA(2)(b).

The State had subsequently issued the 2nd Respondent two grants in terms of

Section 19(4) read together with Section 19(6) of the Ordinance. The grant in

respect of the high land had been issued on 31st July 1995 while the grant in

respect of the paddy land had been issued on Bth February 1999.

4 This Court

must observe that Section 4BA(2) of the Ordinance provides for a grant to be

issued to the spouse of the deceased permit holder, subject to the conditions

stipulated therein, and subject of course to the overarching requirement that a

permit had been issued in the first instance to the deceased spouse (Le.

Piyadasa Bandara). As observed earlier, in this application, the State had not

issued a permit in the name of Piyadasa Bandara.

The Petitioner states that she and her husband, Sumanasiri Ratnayake were

residing on the said high land and had cultivated the said paddy land since

1987, until the death of her husband on 15th February 2009. The Petitioner

states that after his death, she had been prevented from residing on the said

land as well as cultivating the said land. Dissatisfied with the said actions, the

Petitioner had filed action in the District Court of Moneragala. The Petitioner

states that it was at this point of time that she got to know about the issuance

of the said grants to the 2nd Respondent. It is the position of the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner that the issuance of the said grants is

irregular.

The above facts can be summarised as follows:

a) Even though the ledger 'Pl' records the fact that Piyadasa Bandara was to

be given a permit, a formal permit had not been issued to him. Upon his

death, his spouse, the 2nd Respondent has been recognised as a life

interest holder, and there is no dispute between the parties with regard

to the recognition of the 2nd Respondent as a life interest holder.

b) Even though the 2nd Respondent has been recognized as the life interest

holder of Piyadasa Bandara, she did not have the legal entitlement to

nominate a successor. Thus, the initial nomination by the 2nd Respondent

of Sumanasiri Ratnayake, which is relied upon by the Petitioner and which

forms the basis of her prayer for the Writ of Mandamus, and the

8

Website Copy Website Copy

subsequent nomination by the 2nd Respondent of the 1st Respondent and

Sumanasiri Ratnayake, are of no force in law.

In these circumstances, the factual situation that prevails as at this point of

time is the same factual situation that prevailed at the time Piyadasa Bandara

passed away. That is, upon the death of Piyadasa Bandara, the 2nd Respondent

could only have succeeded as a life interest holder, and even if the grants were

issued in her favour, she could not have nominated a successor. As the 2nd

Respondent has succeeded to the land, the successor of Piyadasa Bandara

could only be determined upon the death of the 2nd Respondent, as clearly laid

down in Sections 48, 72 and 73 of the Ordinance. It is therefore the view of this

Court that upon the death of the 2nd Respondent, the State would have to

follow the provisions of Section 72 of the Ordinance and decide the heir of

Piyadasa Bandara who is entitled to succeed to the said lands. The issuing of

the grants have not changed the provisions relating to succession, and

therefore the quashing of the grants issued to the 2nd Respondent will not

serve any useful purpose.

As observed earlier, the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Mandamus "to compel

the 3,d and 4th Respondents to issue a certificate of life interest in the relevant

paddy field / high land in the name of the Petitioner on the basis that her

deceased husband was the lawful successor of the original permit holder as

decided by the State:,5 It is an admitted fact that Piyadasa Bandara had not

nominated a successor and that it was the 2nd Respondent who had nominated

a successor, which the 2nd Respondent could not have done, as she was only a

s Vide paragraph 14(ii) of the petition.

life interest holder. In these circumstances, the basis of the Petitioner's

application for a Writ of Mandamus is misconceived in law.

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is not

entitled to the relief prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed,

without costs.
