Janak De Silva J.

The land forming the subject matter of this application is state land within the meaning of the

Land Development Ordinance (Ordinance). It is depicted as Lot 207 in Final Village Plan No. 306

and is Seven Acres One Rood Fourteen Perches (7A lR 14P) in extent.

This was alienated to Meegasdeniya Kankanamge Don Andiris, father of the Petitioner and 2nd

to 4th Respondents, by grant dated 19th July 1955 issued under the Ordinance (Pl) which was

registered in terms of the Registration of Documents Ordinance.

The Petitioner claims that his father nominated him as the successor which was registered on

the same page in the Tangalle Land Registry (P4). Meegasdeniya Kankanamge Don Andiris died

on 12th March 1964 (P5) at which time the Petitioner was a minor of 11 years.

The predecessor of the 1st Respondent had alienated the land in issue to the mother of the

Petitioner, Peduru Wickremarathna Ratnayake Sumanawathie in 1969 (Pla and P4a). She died

on 13th March 2008 (P6). Prior to her death she had nominated (P7) the following children as

the successors:

(i) 2nd Respondent

(ii) Petitioner

(iii) 3rd Respondent

(iv) 4th Respondent

4 Acres

2A.1R.14P.

1/2 Acre

The Petitioner is seeking the following relief:

(a) Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision contained as an endorsement dated 30.01.1969 in

the grant marked "Pla" and the entry based on the aforesaid endorsement marked as "P4a".

(b) Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to alienate the land in issue to the

Petitioner.

The prayer for a Writ of Certiorari must fail on at least two grounds.

Firstly, Section 48B (1) ofthe Ordinance reads:

"Upon the death of the owner of a holding, the spouse of that owner shall be entitled to

succeed to that holding subject to the following conditions;

a. upon the marriage of such spouse, title to that holding shall devolve on the

nominated successor or on the person who was entitled to succeed under Rule 1 of the

schedule,

b. such spouse shall have no power to dispose of that property,

c. such spouse shall have no power to nominate a successor to that property."

In terms of section 2 of the Ordinance, a grantee is an owner of a holding. Therefore, after

Meegasdeniya Kankanamge Don Andiris died in 1964 his wife Peduru Wickremarathna

Ratnayake Sumanawathie was entitled to succeed irrespective of whether the Petitioner was

validly nominated as a successor. Hence Pla and P4a are valid.

Secondly, the said nomination Pla and P4a was made in 1969 at which time the Petitioner was

16 years old. He is seeking to challenge Pla and P4a more than 45 years after they were made.

The Petitioner is invoking a discretionary remedy which can be refused on grounds of delay. The

delay of over 45 years is an insurmountable obstacle for the Petitioner.

The Writ of Mandamus must also fail at least on two grounds.

Firstly, a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to alienate the land in issue to the

Petitioner cannot be issued when the nomination made by Peduru Wickremarathna Ratnayake

Sumanawathie by P7 exists which the Petitioner has not sought to be quashed. In Weerasooriyo

v. The Choirmon, Notionol Housing Development Authority ond Others [C.A. Application No.

866/98, C.A.M. 08.03.2004] Sripavan J. (as he was then) held that the Court will not set aside a

document unless it is specifically pleaded and identified in express language in the prayer to the

petition. Although the Petitioner alleges that P7 is ultra vires, its invalidity must be determined

by a court of law.

Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th Ed., South Asia Edition (2017) in discussing the

meaning of null and void in Administrative Law states (page 185):

"The primary concern here is the meaning of nullity or voidness solely in the context of

the remedies granted by courts. The concept of nullity has been used to solve other

problem arising in administrative law. For remedial purposes, the orthodox view is that

an ultra vires act is regarded as void and a nullity. An act by a public authority which

lacks legal authority is regarded as incapable of producing legal effects. Once its

illegality is established, and if the courts are prepared to grant a remedy, the act will

be regarded as void from its inception and retrospectively nullified in the sense that it

will be regarded as ever incapable of ever producing legal effects." (emphasis added)

Thus, even where an act of a public authority is ultra vires and a nullity, for remedial purposes

the illegality must be established before a court. As stated by Wade and Forsyth, Administrative

Law, 9th Ed., Indian Edition, 281:

" ... the court will treat an administrative act or order invalid only if the right remedy is

sought by the right person in the right proceedings"

Prior to Mcfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [(1961) 3 All E.R. 1169] this approach was reflected in the

statement of Lord Radcliffe in Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council [(1956) A.C. 736, 769-

770] where he held:

"An order, even if not made in good faith is still an act capable of legal consequences. It

bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead. Unless the necessary proceedings are

taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise upset,

it will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of orders."

Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law, (supra) page 304, after restating the above statement of

Lord Radcliffe sets out the correct position as follows:

"This must be equally true even where the 'brand of invalidity' is plainly visible for there

also the order can effectively be resisted in law only by obtaining the decision of the

court. The necessity of recourse to the court has been pointed out repeatedly in the

House of lords and Privy Council, without distinction between patent and latent

defects. Lord Diplock spoke still more clearly [F Hoffmann-La Roch and C AG v. Secretary

for Trade and Industry (1975) AC 295 at 366], saying that It leads to confusion to use

such terms as 'voidable', 'voidable ab initio', 'void' or 'a nullity' as descriptive of the

Page 4 of 5

status of subordinate legislation alleged to be ultra vires for patent or for latent defects,

before its validity has been pronounced on by a court of competent jurisdiction."

(Emphasis added)

This approach is consistent with the 'presumption of validity' according to which administrative

action is presumed to be valid unless or until it is set aside by a court [F Hoffmann-La Roche and

Co. AG v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) AC 295]. However, this 'presumption

of validity' exists pending a final decision by the court [Lord Hoffmann in R v. Wicks (1998) AC 92

at 115, Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in Boddingtan v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 AC 143 at

156 and 161, and 173-4].

Secondly, in any event the Petitioner has come to Court 6 years after the death of his mother.

Here again the delay cannot be overlooked. In Bisa Menike v. Cyril De Alwis and Others [(1982) 1

SrLL.R. 368 at 379] it was held that an application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within a

reasonable time from the date of the order which the applicant seeks to have quashed. What is

reasonable time and what will constitute undue delay will depend upon the facts of each

particular case. However, the time lag that can be explained does not spell laches or delay. If

the delay can be reasonably explained, the Court will not decline to interfere. The delay which a

Court can excuse is one which is caused by the applicant pursuing a legal remedy and not a

remedy which is extra legal. One satisfactory way to explain the delay is for the Petitioner to

show that he was seeking relief elsewhere in a manner provided by law. The Petitioner in this

case has failed to establish any such ground.

For all the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed with costs.
