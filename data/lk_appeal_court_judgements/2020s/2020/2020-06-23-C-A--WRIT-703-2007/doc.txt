ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an application where the 1st to 3rd Petitioners (hereinafter

referred to as the "Petitioners"), having invoked the jurisdiction conferred

upon this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution, seeks issuance of Writs

of Certiorari and Prohibition against the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The 1st

Petitioner GAC Marine Services (Pvt.) Ltd., is a limited liability Company

incorporated in Sri Lanka, while the 2nd Petitioner is one of its directors

and the 3rd Petitioner is the skipper of the crew boat GAC Ship I and acting

skipper of GAC Ship II respectively.

3

The 1st Respondent is the Director General of Customs and the 2nd

Respondent is the Superintendent of Customs.

In seeking a Writ of Certiorari against the 1st and 2nd Respondents,

the Petitioners move this Court to quash Notices of Seizure marked as

"Xl" and "X2" that had been issued by the said Respondents under

Section 125 of the Customs Ordinance. The issuance of a Writ of

Prohibition is sought by the Petitioners in order to prevent the two

Respondents from "taking any steps whatsoever under the Customs Ordinance

or any other law in order to seize and/or forfeit" the said crew boats, GAC Ship

I and II, and imposing any other punitive sanctions on the Petitioners

without first conducting a due and proper inquiry according to law,

including framing formal charges and affording an opportunity to the

Petitioners for an adequate opportunity to being heard.

Application of the Petitioners was supported ex parte before this

Court on 3rd August 2007 and interim relief, as prayed for was granted

upon their undertaking that the vessels GAC Ship I and II would not sail

beyond 20 nautical miles of the Port of Galle. The said interim order was

varied on several occasions after hearing the parties by this Court, in view

of the contingencies that have arisen subsequently to the issuance of said

interim order initially.

4

It is stated in the petition of the Petitioners that the 1st Petitioner

Company was set up upon an agreement with the Board of Investments on

20th March 1996 as a "BOI Enterprise", primarily to engage in marine

services. The 1st Petitioner Company, acting as shipping agent of Messrs

International Shipping Agencies (Sharjah) Pvt. Ltd, a shipping Company

based in the United Arab Emirates (hereinafter referred to as "ISA"), had

obtained two crew boats (GAC Ship I and II) from the said Company,

which retained its ownership. The two vessels GAC Ship I and II, arrived

in Sri Lanka on 18.01.1994 and 24.02.1985 respectively. The 1st Petitioner

Company, having obtained a shipping agents license in relation to GAC

Ship I and II, stationed them in the Port of Galle to perform shipping

related services in Sri Lanka.

The 1st Petitioner Company, at a later point of time had decided to

purchase the two vessels from ISA and the transfer of purchase

consideration of USD 400,000.00 was made on 31.10.1997 after obtaining an

import license dated 20.10.1997 from the Controller of Imports and

Exports. Thereafter, the two vessels were utilized and deployed by the 1st

Petitioner Company in and around Port of Galle, for its shipping related

business operations, in the manner contemplated by the provisions of the

said BOI agreement.

On 27.01.2001, Sri Lanka Customs had commenced an investigation

in respect of GAC Ship I and II and directed the 1st Petitioner to tender

relevant documentation in respect of the two vessels, followed by another

5

directive dated 14.02.2001 to submit "Customs Declaration, the receipts of

payment of taxes and a copy of the BOI agreement".

The 1st Petitioner Company, tendered the BOI agreement and

informed Sri Lanka Customs that it " ... did not have any Customs entries etc.

in its possession, since the 1st Petitioner Company had not imported the said crew

boats but had merely purchased the same in Sri Lanka and that no duty had

therefore become payable."The Sri Lanka Customs directed the 1st Petitioner

Company again on the 28.06.2001 to furnish Customs documents on the

two vessels and the Company had reiterated its position.

Thereafter the 2nd Petitioner received notices dated 06.08.2001 and

16.08.2001, issued by Chief Assistant Preventive Officer of Sri Lanka

Customs under Section 9 of the Customs Ordinance, requesting his

presence for the purpose of "furnishing information". When the 2nd

Petitioner presented himself to the Sri Lanka Customs, he was informed

that" the 1st Petitioner Company was liable to pay Turnover Tax and Defence

Levy on account of "importation" of the two vessels GAC Ship I and II. The

1st Respondent maintained its denial of importation of the two vessels.

Thereafter, the 2nd Petitioner had received notice of a Customs inquiry

under reference No. P /Misc/92/2001, informing him that it is to be held

on 19.11.2001.

6

At this juncture the Petitioners have sought to quash the said notice

of inquiry before this Court under Writ Application No. 1880/2001, by

seeking Writ of Certiorari. They also sought Writ of Prohibition preventing

Sri Lanka Customs proceeding with the inquiry. The Respondents have

resisted the application. After an inquiry, the Court pronounced its

judgment on 16.05.2007. With the delivery of its judgment, this Court had

decided to dismiss the Petitioner's application.

In relation to the instant application, the Petitioners have

encapsulated the factual basis on which they rely upon, in invoking the

jurisdiction conferred upon this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution

and thereby seeking to quash the Notices of Seizure, marked "X-I" and "X-

2", referring to the subsequent events that took place after the

pronouncement of the said judgment in Writ Application No. 1880/2001.

It is therefore appropriate to reproduce the said paragraph from

their petition in full. The said paragraph states thus:-

"However, most startlingly, the Sri Lanka Customs, despite

not having taken any steps since the said judgment

(including not informing the 1st and/or 2nd Petitioner as to

when the aforesaid inquiry was to recommence if at all,

and/or without holding any inquiry whatsoever at which the

petitioners were informed of any purported charges against

them and/or affording any opportunity to be heard in respect

thereof, on 1st August 2007), nevertheless, the 2nd

7

Respondent entered the Calle Port at which the boats were

berthed and purporting to act in terms of Section125 of the

Customs Ordinance read with allegedly the Exchange

Control Act, purported to illegally seize the boats "CAC

Ship I and CAC Ship lI" owned by the l sI Petitioner, by

handing over to the 3rd Petitioner the skipper of the crew boat

CAC Ship I and the acting skipper of crew boat CAC Ship II,

the purported notices of seizure. "

In these circumstances the Petitioners allege that the issuance of

Notices of Seizure by 1st and 2nd Respondents, in respect of Crew boats

GAC Ship I and II, is done;

a. "arbitrarily, illegally, unlawfully and ultra vires,

b. without proper inquiry,

c. With mala fide and due to other collateral motives,

d. upon deliberate misinterpretation of the judgment in

Writ Application No. 1880/2001",

and therefore they would suffer "unbearable financial loss" as a result.

The Respondents resisted the application of the Petitioners and

sought its dismissal and vacation of interim relief granted by this Court on

the basis;

i. the matter is already Res Judicata among the parties,

8

II. there is no requirement or determination that Sri Lanka

Customs must give the Petitioners advance notice of the

fact that it intends only to record a statement.

At the hearing of the instant application, learned President's

Counsel for the Petitioners contended that the course of action adopted by

the Respondent since the pronouncement of the judgment In Writ

Application No. 1880/2001 on 16.05.2007 is clearly tainted as they

proceeded to issue Notices of Seizure under Section 125 of the Customs

Ordinance, where a prior Declaration of Forfeiture of the two Crew boats

is a prerequisite. It is also alleged that the Respondents were in gross

violation of the said judgment, when they failed to hold an inquiry

subsequent to the dismissal of the Petitioner's application, as directed by

Court. It was stressed by the learned President's Counsel that page 5 of

the said judgment had clearly ordered on the Respondents to proceed with

the inquiry. He also submitted that the approach of the preliminary

inquiry would have been inquisitorial while the approach in the inquiry

proper naturally would be adversarial. It was contended that the

Respondents have therefore acted in gross violation of these well

established procedures in relation to Customs inquiries, since they have

decided to serve Notices of Seizure on the Petitioners without an inquiry

as ordered by Court.

The Petitioners have relied on the judgment of Vallibel Lanka Pvt

Ltd., v Director General of Customs and Others (2008) 1 Sri L.R. 219 where

9

it has been held that a "ship" could not be considered as an item of

"importable goods" and therefore the reference to "all goods" in Section

125 of the Customs Ordinance has no application to the sea vessels, thus

taking away the powers of the Respondent to act under the said Section. It

was contended that the liability to pay taxes arises only if the vessel was

used to bring in any "goods" and for not brining in the vessel itself, as in

this particular instant.

Therefore, it was submitted that the Respondents have acted

arbitrarily, illegally, unlawfully and ultra vires, warranting intervention of

this Court with the issuance of Writs as prayed for.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General strenuously argued that the

instant matter is res judicata among the parties since the Petitioners opted

not to challenge the judgment in Writ Application No 1880/2001,by which

the core dispute among parties whether there was an importation or not of

the two crew boats GAC Ship I and II, had already been resolved by this

Court. It was contended by the learned DSG that the Petitioners have

"reformulated/ repackaged" the already decided dispute by filing the

instant application. The inquiry too was to determine the same identical

issue and if there was no distinct pronouncement by Court that the said

two vessels have been "imported" into Sri Lanka, then only the 1st

Respondent could have proceeded to hold an inquiry in order to

determine the said issue.

10

In view of the submissions of the Respondents that the matter is res

judicata and if that is the case, then the Petitioners cannot re-agitate for the

second round what had already been decided by this Court. It is, therefore,

appropriate to consider the said contention before this Court ventures to

consider the Petitioner's challenge on the validity of the Notices of Seizure.

The Respondents rely on the judgment of Karunaratne v Amarisa66

NLR 567, which had identified several considerations a Court would

employ in making a ruling whether a matter is res judicata among the

parties. Tambiah J stated that "the doctrine operates when the following

essentials are present" and had thought it fit to list them by reproducing

them as reflected in previous local judicial pronouncements. These

identified" essentials" are as follows:-

(1) There must be a judgment of a Court of competent

jurisdiction

(2) There must be a final judgment

(3) The case must have been decided on its merits

(4) The parties must be identical or be the

representatives in interest of the original parties

(5) The causes of action must be identical

The then Supreme Court in Wijeshighe v Asilin Nona 80 NLR 213,

considered the doctrine of res judicata, this time in the light of several

English judgments. The judgment reads thus;

11

"The rule of res judicata is not confined to issues which the

Court is actually asked to decide, but it covers issues or facts

which are so clearly part of the subject-matter of the

litigation and so clearly could have been raised that it would

be an abuse of the process of the Court to allow a new

proceeding to be started in respect of them." - per Somerville,

L. f. in Greenhalgh v Mallard(1947) 2 All E.R. 255. The

locus classicus of this principle of res judicata is the

judgment of Wigram, v.c. In Henderson v

Henderson(1843) 3 Hare 114 where he says:

"Where a given matter becomes the subject of

litigation in and of adjudication by a Court of

competent jurisdiction, the Court requires the parties

to that litigation to bring forward their whole case

and will not (except under special circumstances)

permit the same parties to open the same subject of

litigation in respect of a matter which might have

been brought forward as part of the subject in contest,

but which was not brought forward, only because they

have, from negligence, inadvertence, or even accident

omitted part of their case. The plea of res judicata

applies, except in special cases, not only to points

upon which the Court was actually required by the

parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment,

bu t to every point which properly belonged to the

subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising

12

reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at

the time."

This statement of the law has been cited with approval by the

Privy Council in Hoystead v. Commissioner of

Taxation(1926) A.c. 155 and in Yat Tung Investment

Ltd., v. Dao Heng Bank Ltd(1957) A.c. 581 .

These quotations embody most of the multiple facets in which the

doctrine of res judicata is viewed by Courts and therefore the

Respondent's submissions as well as the Petitioner's reply to it would

have to be considered by this Court, in the light of the principles

enunciated in these judgments.

There is no dispute that the judgment in the Writ Application No.

1880/2001 satisfies the "essentials" (per the judgment of Karunaratne v

Amarisa) that should be there to apply the doctrine of res judicata to the

instant application. The Petitioner's reply on this contention by the

Respondents aimed at its 5th " essential", the causes of action must be

identical. It IS their contention, that the Court had directed the

Respondents to hold an inquiry under the Customs Ordinance by its

judgment but what they did instead was to serve Notices of Seizure,

having denied an opportunity for the Petitioner's to present its position.

13

In these circumstances, consideration of the judgment in Writ

Application No. 1880/2001 is necessary in order to determine whether the

"causes of action" are identical or not.

The judgment of this Court on Writ Application No. 1880/2001

indicates that the dispute presented before it by the parties were whether

the Petitioners have bought the two Crew boats locally as they claim or

whether the two vessels were "imported" in to Sri Lanka as the

Respondents claim.

In considering this pivotal issue, the Court had considered the two

fold submissions of the Petitioners that had been presented before it. The

Petitioners have contended that when they bought the two vessels by

transfer of funds to the Company which owned them, they were already

in Sri Lankan waters and therefore the transaction should be considered

as a local purchase. In addition, the Petitioners claimed that what can be

imported is the cargo a vessel carries and not the vessel itself.

In relation to the contention of local purchase, the Court

stated;

"The Petitioner after taking all the steps stated above that are

necessary for the importation of the said vessels and took

possession of the vessels with the intention of permanently

14

stationed in Galle port cannot claim that they have not

imported the vessels were in Sri Lanka waters.

If suppose the said vessels were anchored outside the

territorial waters of Sri Lanka during the relevant time the

Petitioners would have followed the same procedure to

import the said vessels and they cannot claim that they have

merely purchased the said vessels. Therefore, the fact that the

vessels were brought into Sri Lanka waters (few days or few

years) before the formalities of importations are completed

will not change the character of importation."

In relation to the contention that a ship cannot be imported, the

Court, having considered several authoritative texts and judicial

precedents, stated;

"A ship or a vessel is imported or not depends on the purpose

for which it is used and the intention of the owner of the ship

or the vessel. Therefore, the contention of the Petitioners that

a ship or a vessel cannot be imported under any

circumstances is untenable."

The final paragraph of the judgment, it is ruled by Court;

"The Petitioners challenge to the notices issued on 6.B.2001

(P2B), 16.0B.2001 (P30), 6.9.2001 (P31) and 19.10.2001

(P32) by the 2"d and 3rd Respondents under Section Band 9

of the Customs Ordinance is based on the contention that the

said vessels are not imported but purchased. On the material

available the importation of these vehicles are prima facie

15

established. Therefore, the said customs inquiry for which the

said notices were issued cannot be said to be unlawful,

unwarranted or ultra vires or in excess of powers of the 2nd

or 3rd Respondents."

Thus, it is clear that the contentious issue of whether the vessels were

imported into Sri Lanka had been decided by this Court by its judgment in

Writ Application 1880/2001 and therefore is res judicata among the parties

since there was no challenge to the said pronouncement. In fact, the

Petitioners, in filing the instant application, do not challenge that

determination. In paragraph 3(v) it is stated" ... although the 1st Petitioner

Company was not responsible in any manner whatsoever for the

importation of the said crew boats .. . " with this statement, the Petitioners

seem to have admitted that there was importation of vessels.

The Petitioners, however, chose not to identify the entity responsible

for the importation of the two vessels. They maintain the two vessels had

been brought to_ Sri Lanka. In paragraphs 3(k) and (i), the Petitioners state

the two crew boats have arrived in Sri Lanka on 18.01.1994 and 24.02.1995.

The fact remains that the two vessels that were under the ownership of

ISA, a Sharjah based Company, brought into Sri Lanka by GAC Shipping

ltd., a subsidiary Company of the 1st Petitioner Company, acting as the

local agent of ISA. The Petitioners have not disclosed the exact nature of

the relationship between GAC Shipping Ltd. and ISA or the terms upon

which the two vessels were brought into Sri Lanka. The Petitioners claim

16

that the ownership changed only when the two vessels were already in Sri

Lanka.

Only way the Petitioners have sought to challenge the determination

that the two vessels were imported is placing heavy reliance on the

judgment of Vallibel Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., v Director General of Customs and

Others (2008) 1 Sri L.R. 219, which had been decided after the

determination by this Court in Writ Application No. 1880/2001 and also to

the impugned issuance of Notices of Seizure.

It is clear form a closer examination of the reasoning of that

judgment it will not assist the Petitioner's cause at this stage. In the said

judgment what the Supreme Court had determined is that it is "unable to

find any provision on the Customs Ordinance which contemplates or makes

provision for a sailing vessel as being a "good" within the meaning of Section 16".

The Supreme Court also held that it is " ... unable to hold that a vessel arriving

in the ordinary course of navigation carrying goods on board falls within the

definition of an "imported good" in terms of Section 16 read with section 47".

The Petitioners, when they sought intervention of Court by filing

Writ Application No. 1880/2001, have thereby enervated the Respondents

from continuation of the inquiry beyond its nominal commencement with

the issuance of notices under Section 9 of the Customs Ordinance. This

inquiry was so initiated by the Respondents, in order to decide whether

there was importation of the two vessels into Sri Lanka or they were

merely purchased locally as the Petitioners claim. At that point of time, the

17

Respondents have not decided upon imposition of any pecuniary liability

on the Petitioners, either by way of imposition of a Government tax or

Customs duty as they did in Vallibel Lanka( Pvt Ltd., v Director General

of Customs and Others (supra).

When the said Writ application reached its conclusion, the

determination of the Court on this issue as referred to above, made it

redundant for the Respondents to proceed with intended inquiry, during

which the Petitioners are provided with an opportunity of presenting their

position for consideration. The Petitioners have by then intimated their

position by replying that they" ... did not have any Customs entries etc. in its

possession, since the l si Petitioner Company had not imported the said crew boats

but had merely purchased the same in Sri Lanka and that no duty had therefore

become payable."

Contrary to the Respondents claim, the issue of importation is not

the crux of the contention of the Petitioners in this application. They

instead focus on a particular event and its consequences that followed after

the judgment of Writ Application No. 1880/2001, as the point of contest.

This position is clearly indicative from the contents of paragraph 10 of the

Petition that had been reproduced earlier in this judgment.

It is obvious that the Respondents have proceeded to serve Notices

of Seizure, upon the strength of the pronouncement of this Court that the

two vessels were in fact had been imported. The whole dispute

fundamentally originates from that determination. However, a niche in 18

which the Petitioners have found to place this application is, the claim that

they were served with a Notices of Seizure without an inquiry, an act of the

Respondents, allegedly violative of the Court order and also to the

established principles of public law.

This dispute could not be termed as identical with the point of

dispute presented for adjudication by this Court, by the Petitioners in Writ

Application No. 1880/2001 and therefore the present application of the

Petitioners, in seeking to challenge Notices of Seizure, could not be

considered as res judicata.

The Petitioners contend that by the judgment of this Court in Writ

Application No. 1880/2001, there is an order of Court on the Respondent to

hold an inquiry. Perusal of the said judgment did not reveal an order of

Court to that effect. The relevant portion of the judgment reads thus;

"But the time of importation is a matter of fact and it has to

be determined by the relevant authorities considering the

facts and circumstances of each case."

This particular direction could be referable to the proVISIOns of

Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance, which is intended to govern a

situation where" ... it shall become necessary to determine the precise time at

which an importation or exportation of any goods made and completed shall be

deemed to have had effect, ... " and not to determine whether there was an

importation of the two vessels. If there is an act of importation in the first

19

place, then only this situation could arise as a secondary consideration.

When the Respondents have issued the Notices of Seizure, it is not for the

purpose of determining" the precise time at which an importation of any goods

made and completed" the issue the Court had left to the Respondents to

determine after an inquiry.

The Respondents have been served with Notices of Seizure issued

under Section 125 of the Customs Ordinance. In Dias v The Director

General of Customs (2001) 3 Sri L.R. 281, J.A.N. de Silva PICA (as he was

then) had the occasion to consider " ... the scope of the power of seizure under

the Customs Ordinance."

His Lordship, after evaluation of the scheme of the customs

Ordinance" ... dealing with situations in which goods are forfeited" concluded

thus;

" ... it is clear that a customs officer making seizure must act

bona fide and on the basis of a reasonable suspicion. This

denotes the commencement of a customs investigation.

Further steps may also be taken under Section 9(1) of the

Ordinance to issue statutory notices for production of

relevant documen ts. Inquiries may also be made under

Section 8(1) for this purpose any person could be examined

on oath. These inquiries under Section 8(1) are generally a

sequel to the investigation in which relevant evidence may be

gathered to provide the foundation for an inquiry, charges

are framed and the statutory election made under Section

20

129 or 130 at the conclusion of this process. In terms of

Section 163 the Director General of Customs may mitigate

the forfeiture or penalty and the decision is subject to review

by the Minister."

It was contended on behalf of the Petitioner before his Lordship in

the said application, as in the instant application, that he "should have been

given a hearing before the seizure is effected". The Court was not inclined to

accept that argument as it concluded that;

"The scheme of the Customs Ordinance recognizes and gives

an opportunity to the person whose goods are seized to

vindicate himself at a subsequent inquiry. It should be kept

in mind that the Court would interfere only if the statutory

procedure laid down is insufficient to achieve justice. I hold

that there is nothing wanting in the procedure set out in the

Customs Ordinance."

In coming to this conclusion, his Lordship relied on the following

statement of Lord Reid in the judgment of Wiseman v Borneman1971 AC

298;

"Every public officer who has to decide whether to prosecute

or raise proceedings ought first to decide whether there is a

prima facie case, but no one supposes that justice requires

that he should first seek the comments of the accused or the

defendant on the material before him. So there is nothing

inherently unjust in reaching such a decision in the absence

of the other parhJ. "

21

The application of the Petitioner in Dias v The Director General of

Customs (supra) was dismissed emphasising the only requirement for the

Customs to hold an inquiry is the existence of prima facie material before

the Respondent. In Jayaratne v Director General, Customs Department

and Others (2005) 3 Sri L.R. 102, is an instance where Sripavan J (as he was

then) with concurrence of de Abrew J, has cited the reasoning of Dias v The

Director General of Customs with approval. This Court is therefore bound

by that reasoning.

In this instance, the material before this Court indicate that there was

prima facie material before the Respondent that the two vessels were

imported (by way of a Court ruling) and, upon their own admission, the

Petitioners had no Customs documentation to produce in relation to the

said importation. Therefore, the issuance of the Notices of Seizure is not

tainted by any of the defects that the Petitioners allege. It appears that the

Petitioners have sought intervention of this Court rather prematurely, in

view of the below quoted observation made by HNG Fernando CJ in the

judgment of Kothari v Fernando 74 NLR 463;

"Tt thus appears that the Legislature did have it in mind that

there may be a seizure of goods lawfully imported and

therefore not subject to forfeiture. The fact that a competent

Court may subsequently decide, in proceedings referred to in

s. 154, that the goods were not forfeited by the operation of 5.

43, does not by itself render the seizure unlawful."

22

. '

The Petitioners have in their submissions before this Court relied

heavily on the determination of the Supreme Court in Vallibel Lanka (Pvt.)

Ltd., v Director General of Customs and Others (supra) in their attempt to

quash the Notices of Seizure. The Respondents have issued the impugned

Notices of Seizure were served on 1st August 2007. The Petitioners have

filed the instant application on the following day the 2nd August 2007. The

judgment of Vallibel Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd., v Director General of Customs and

Others (supra)was pronounced by the Supreme Court only in August 2008,

while this application was pending its determination before this Court.

Therefore, none of the parties have had the benefit of the determination of

the apex Court, in the said judgment, when the Notices of Seizure were

served or when the instant application was filed before this Court. In the

circumstances, it is safe to assume that what the Petitioners seek from this

Court is to apply the reasoning of Vallibel Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd., v Director

General of Customs and Others (supra) which had been pronounced when

the instant application was awaiting its final determination. If this Court

were to apply the determination of the apex Court to the instant

application as the Petitioners pray, then it must apply it in retrospectively.

In view of the contention of the Petitioners that the said judgment

applies to their application, this Court must then consider whether a

judgment of a Court could be applied retrospectively.

23

.'

In the House of Lords Judgment of National Westminster Bank pic v

Spectrum Plus Limited and Others and Others [2005] UKHL 41, their

Lordships have held that legal principles enunciated in the judgment of

Slade J in Siebe Gorman & Co Ltd v Barclays Bank Ltd [1979] 2 Lloyd's

Rep 142 was wrong and should be overruled. Then the bank contended

that if the House considered Siebe Gonnan was wrongly decided the

House should overrule that decision only for the future. This contention

provided the opportunity for the House of Lords to examine the legality of

application of a judgment, prospectively and retrospectively and of the

consequences such an application would ensue.

Having heard the submissions for an against on prospective and

retrospective application of their Lordships judgment, Nicholls LJ stated

that " ... a Court ruling which changes the law from what it was previously

thought to be operates retrospectively as well as prospectively. The ruling will have

a retrospective effect so far as the parties to the particular dispute are concerned,

... ". (emphasis added).

His Lordship, in expressing out the underlying rationale of this

determination, stated thus;

"People generally conduct their affairs on the basis of what

they understand the law to be. This 'retrospective' effect of a

change in the law of this nature can have disruptive and

seemingly unfair consequences. 'Prospective overruling',

24

..

"

sometimes described as 'non-retroactive overruling', is a

judicial tool fashioned to mitigate these adverse

consequences. It is a shorthand description for Court rulings

on points of law which, to greater or lesser extent, are

designed not to have the normal retrospective effect of

judicial decisions."

In relation to the concept of prospective overruling, his Lordship

states that;

"Prospective overruling takes several different forms. In its

simplest form prospective overruling involves a Court giving

a ruling of the character sought by the bank in the present

case. Overruling of this simple or 'pure' type has the effect

that the Court ruling has an exclusively prospective effect.

The ruling applies only to transactions or happenings

occurring after the date of the Court decision. All

transactions entered into, or events occurring, before that

date continue to be governed by the law as it was conceived

to be before the Court gave its ruling."

In the instant application, although there was no "overruling" of its

previously held view on the same point by the Supreme Court by the

pronouncement of the judgment in Vallibel Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd., v Director

General of Customs and Others (supra) as in the House of Lords judgment

of National Westminster Bank pic v Spectrum Plus Limited and Others

and Others (supra), when their Lordships have decided that a "ship" could

not be considered as an item of "importable goods" thereby taking away

25

"ships"" from the description of "goods" as referred to in the provisions of

Customs Ordinance.

The Petitioners were obviously not a party referred to in the

judgment of Vallibel Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd., v Director General of Customs and

Others (supra). Therefore, as far as the Petitioners are concerned, the

determination of the Supreme Court in the said matter, applies to them

only in prospectively and not in retrospectively. The Respondents, by

serving Seizure Notices on the 3rd Petitioner, have accordingly, acted well

within the law as it stood on the date of the issuance of said notices. Thus,

the Petitioners have failed to establish that the Respondents have acted

arbitrarily, illegally, unlawfully and ultra vires and thereby intervention of

this Court is not warranted.

Accordingly, the application of the Petitioners is refused and their

petition is dismissed.
