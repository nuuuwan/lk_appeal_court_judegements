Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Chanaka Kulatunga for the Petitioners

Dr. Charuka Ekanayake, State Counsel for the 3rd Respondent Argued on: 24th July 2020 Written Tendered on behalf of the Petitioners on 1st July 2020 Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the 3rd Respondent on 23rd October 2019 Decided on: 16th November 2020

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

All sixteen Petitioners retired from their employment with the 3rd Respondent, the

Ceylon Electricity Board (the CEB), in December 2009 or during 2010. The Petitioners

state that in 2009, the CEB had felicitated its employees who had completed forty years

of service with the CEB as at 1st November 2009, and that the said employees were

given a Gold medal (coin) and conferred with certain other benefits. The grievance of

the Petitioners is that even though they too had completed forty years of service on that

date, they were neither felicitated nor were they awarded the said medal and other

benefits.

It is not in dispute that the 1st 3rd Petitioners had lodged a complaint in this regard

with the Department of Labour in September 2010. By a letter dated 21st April 2011

marked I, the Assistant Commissioner of Labour had determined that the 1st 3rd

Petitioners have completed forty years of service, and had recommended that the 1st

3rd Petitioners be issued with a gold medal.1

1 This determination is based on Clause 6 of the letter of apprenticeship, and will be discussed later in the judgment.

4

While this Court has not been apprised of the steps taken by the CEB on the above

letter, the Petitioners have produced a letter dated 29th March 2013 marked J

addressed to the Commissioner General of Labour by which the 1st Petitioner had

expanded the number of employees who were similarly circumstanced to sixteen. It is

these sixteen former employees of the CEB who are the Petitioners in this application.

The Minister of Labour, acting in terms of Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act had

issued an Order dated 11th July 2013, appointing the 4th Respondent as the Arbitrator to

determine the following dispute:

Whether any injustice has been caused to the (said) sixteen employees who were

employed at the Ceylon Electricity Board by not considering their period of service

at the Government Department of Electricity in the calculation of service period at

the Ceylon Electricity Board, and if so, to what reliefs each of them is entitled.2

Although the dispute that was referred to the Arbitrator was wider in scope than the

issue that had arisen at the outset, the Arbitrator was essentially required to determine

whether the Petitioners had completed forty years of service as at 1st November 2009,

either at the CEB alone, or cumulatively with the period of service that the Petitioners

claimed they had at the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings (the

Department).

Inquiry before the Arbitrator

The Inquiry before the Arbitrator had commenced on 1st November 2013. The 1st and

2nd Petitioners had given evidence, and had been subjected to cross examination on

behalf of the CEB. Thereafter, on 17th March 2017, the learned Counsel appearing for

the CEB before the Arbitrator had proposed that the inquiry be disposed of on the

written submissions of the parties, instead of going through a long winded process of all

sixteen Petitioners giving, probably the same evidence.3 Upon the agreement of the

learned Counsel for the Petitioners, the parties had filed written submissions together

with documents.

By an award dated 11th August 2017, the Arbitrator had answered the aforementioned

question referred to him in the negative. Dissatisfied by the said Award, the Petitioners

filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the said award of the Arbitrator;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Arbitrator to grant the Petitioners the relief as

sought;

c) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Arbitrator to declare that the Petitioners have

completed forty years of service, and are entitled to the benefits received by other

employees who were similarly placed.

The role of the Arbitrator

Section 17(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act sets out the role of the Arbitrator in the

following manner:

When an industrial dispute has been referred under section 3(1)(d) or section 4(1)

to an arbitrator for settlement by arbitration,

he shall make all such inquiries into the dispute as he may consider necessary,

hear such evidence as may be tendered by the parties to the dispute, and

thereafter make such award as may appear to him just and equitable.

In Brown & Company v. Minister of Labour,4 Justice Saleem Marsoof, P.C., having

analysed the wide powers and duties conferred on an arbitrator, held as follows:

Arbitration under the Industrial Disputes Act is intended to be even more liberal,

informal and flexible than commercial arbitration, primarily because the Arbitrator

is empowered to make an award which is "just and equitable". When an industrial

dispute has been referred under Section 3 (1)(d) or Section 4(1) of the Industrial

Disputes Act to an Arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, Section 17(1) of the said

Act requires such Arbitrator to "make all such inquiries into the dispute as he may

consider necessary, hear such evidence as may be tendered by the parties to the

dispute, and thereafter make such award as may appear to him just and

equitable". In my view, the word "make" as used in the said provision, has the

effect of throwing the ball into the Arbitrator's court, so to speak, and requires him

to initiate what inquiries he considers are necessary. The Arbitrator is not simply

called upon "to hold an inquiry", where the ball would be in the court of the parties

to the dispute and, it would be left to them to tender what evidence they consider

necessary requiring the arbitrator to be just a judge presiding over the inquiry, the

control and progress of which will be in the hands of the parties themselves or their

Counsel. What the Industrial Disputes Act has done appears to me to be to

substitute in place of the rigid procedures of the law envisaged by the "adversarial

system", a new and more flexible procedure, which is in keeping with the fashion in

which equity in English law gave relief to the litigants from the rigidity of the

common law. The function of the arbitral power in relation to industrial disputes is

to ascertain and declare what in the opinion of the Arbitrator ought to be the

respective rights and liabilities of the parties as they exist at the moment the

proceedings are instituted. His role is more inquisitorial, and he has a duty to go in

search for the evidence, and he is not strictly required to follow the provisions of

the Evidence Ordinance in doing so. Just as much as the procedure before the

arbitrator is not governed by the rigid provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, the

procedure followed by him need not be fettered by the rigidity of the law.

In Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe5 it was held by Chief Justice

H.N.G.Fernando as follows:

I hold that when the Industrial Disputes Act confers on an Arbitrator the discretion

to make an award which is 'just and equitable', the Legislature did not intend to

confer on an Arbitrator the freedom of a wild horse. An award must be 'just and

equitable' as between the parties to a dispute; and the fact that one party might

have encountered 'hard times' because of personal circumstances for which the

other party is in no way responsible is not a ground on which justice or equity

requires the other party to make undue concessions. In addition, it is time that this

Court should correct what seems to be a prevalent misconception. The mandate

which the Arbitrator in an industrial dispute holds under the law requires him to

make an award which is just and equitable, and not necessarily an award which

favours an employee. An Arbitrator holds no licence from the Legislature to make

any such award as he may please, for nothing is just and equitable which is decided

by whim or caprice or by the toss of a double-headed coin.

The Supreme Court, in Singer Industries (Ceylon) Limited vs The Ceylon Mercantile

Industrial and General Workers Union and others6 agreeing with the observations in

Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe7 held as follows:

It is a cardinal principle of law that in making an award by an arbitrator there

must be a judicial and objective approach and more importantly the perspectives

both of employer as well as the employee should be considered in a balanced

manner and undoubtedly just and equity must apply to both these parties. In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union vs Nestle Lanka Limited8 this

Court held as follows:

5 71 NLR 223 at page 225. Referred to with approval in Standard Chartered Grindlays Bank Limited vs The Minister of Labour [SC Appeal No. 22/2003; SC Minutes of 4th April 2008]. 6 SC Appeal No. 78/08; SC Minutes of 7th October 2010. 7 Supra. 8 [1999] 1 Sri LR 343 at page 348.

The arbitrator to whom a reference has been made in terms of section 4 (1) of the

Industrial Disputes Act as amended is expected to act judicially. He is required in

arriving at his determinations to decide legal questions affecting the rights of the

subject and hence he is under a duty to act judicially. Although such arbitrator does

not exercise judicial power in the strict sense, it is his duty to act judicially.

It has been stressed that such an arbitrator's function is judicial in the sense that he

has to hear parties, decide facts, apply rules with judicial impartiality and his

decision is objective as that of any court of law, though ultimately he makes such

award as may appear to him to be just and equitable. Vide the decision in Nadaraja

Limited and Others. v. Krishnadasan and Others 9.

The above authorities place a burden on the Arbitrator to take the role of an

investigator and probe into the dispute, without leaving it entirely to the parties to place

before him the necessary facts and material. I must state however that that does not

take away the burden placed on the parties to prove their respective cases, which

burden, very unfortunately, the Petitioners have failed to discharge. The Arbitrator is

required to thereafter arrive at an award which appears to him to be just and equitable.

Duty of the Arbitrator to consider the case of the Petitioners

As agreed before the Arbitrator, the parties had tendered written submissions together

with documents. The Arbitrator however had only considered the cases of the 1st and 3rd

Petitioners, for the following reason:

The Arbitrator has completely lost sight of the agreement reached before him by the

parties that the matter can be disposed of on written submissions, with all parties being

entitled to file the necessary documents with their written submissions. Hence, it is

clear that the Arbitrator has misdirected himself on this ground when he arrived at the

above conclusion.

I therefore have two options before me.

The first is to refer this matter for a fresh consideration of the positions of all Petitioners

on the basis of the material that was available to the Arbitrator. I am however mindful

that the 4th Respondent is functus the moment he gives his award, except to consider an

application for interpretation under Section 34(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

Therefore, even though any order for a fresh consideration of the matter must be

directed to the Minister, the Petitioners have not sought any such relief from this Court.

The second option is for me to consider the arguments of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners and the learned State Counsel, examine the material that was available

before the Arbitrator, and arrive at a determination whether the decision of the

Arbitrator is arbitrary, irrational or illegal.

The latter option is preferred by me, for two reasons.

The first is that the cases of the Petitioners, as presented to the Arbitrator, were

identical in most respects, subject to certain differences which would be referred to

later in this judgment. The reasoning of the Arbitrator in respect of the 1st and 3rd

Petitioners would therefore apply with equal force to the rest of the Petitioners. Thus,

10

the failure to consider the facts relating to each Petitioner separately has not prejudiced

the Petitioners.

The second reason why I prefer the latter option is that the alleged grievance of the

Petitioners arose over ten years ago. Two Petitioners have passed away since then. A

fresh consideration by an Arbitrator and a possible challenge to the award will only

mean more time and cost for all parties.

Therefore, in the interests of justice, I shall review the legality and the reasonableness of

the award in the light of the material presented to the Arbitrator in respect of each

Petitioner.

Material tendered by the CEB to this Court

The first part of this judgment shall consist of the above review.

In its Statement of Objections, the CEB has sought to differentiate or distinguish the

cases of the 13th 15th Petitioners from the rest of the Petitioners. This differentiation

has not been presented to the Arbitrator by either party. Furthermore, in response to

certain questions posed by Court, the General Manager of the CEB, together with his

affidavit dated 27th January 2020 has tendered additional material pertaining to all

Petitioners. In the second part of this judgment, I shall consider the fresh material that

has now been presented to this Court by the CEB in order to decide whether the

Petitioners are in any event, entitled to any relief. In this regard, I must state that the

Petitioners have not presented any material to contradict the aforementioned fresh

material.

Grounds for Judicial Review

In Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service,10 Lord Diplock stated

that:

10 [1985] AC 374

11

Judicial review has I think developed to a stage today when without reiterating

any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can

conveniently classify under three heads the grounds upon which administrative

action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground I would call

'illegality', the second 'irrationality' and the third 'procedural impropriety'.

The Petitioners are not claiming that there has been any procedural impropriety in the

manner in which the proceedings before the Arbitrator were conducted, other than

what I have already referred to. Nor are the Petitioners claiming that the decision of the

Arbitrator is illegal. The complaint of the Petitioners is that the decision of the Arbitrator

is unreasonable and irrational.

The test to determine the reasonableness of a decision was laid down by Lord Greene in

Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation11 when he defined

unreasonableness as something so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream

that it lay within the powers of the authority. In Council of Civil Service Unions vs

Minister for the Civil Service12 Lord Diplock, in describing irrationality referred to

Wednesbury, when he stated that, By irrationality I mean what can now be succinctly

referred to as Wednesbury unreasonableness. It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible

person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.

I shall now consider the position of the Petitioners and the CEB, as presented to the

Arbitrator. The submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners that the

Petitioners had completed forty years of service with the CEB as at 1st November 2009 is

based on three letters that have been issued to the Petitioners.

11 [1948] 1 KB 223 at 229. 12 Supra.

12

The first letter Letter of Apprenticeship

The first is the letter by which all Petitioners were offered a period of apprenticeship by

the Department. There is no dispute that the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners were issued

with a letter of apprenticeship dated 19th July 1968, informing them that their one year

period of apprenticeship will commence on 16th August 1968. The other three

Petitioners, namely the 13th - 15th Petitioners have been issued with letters of

apprenticeship dated 26th July 1967 informing that their one year period of

apprenticeship will commence on 8th August 1967. The contents of the said letters are

identical, except of course the date of commencement of the period of apprenticeship.

I have examined the letter issued to the 1st Petitioner, marked A1 before the

Arbitrator, the relevant parts of which are re-produced below:

The Petitioners claim that the above letter issued by the Department is a letter of

employment, and hence the period of employment of the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners

with the Department commenced on 16th August 1968, while the period of employment

of the 13th 15th Petitioners with the Department commenced on 8th August 1967. The

learned State Counsel has however taken up the position that the said letters are not

letters by which the Petitioners were offered employment. The Arbitrator has

considered the said letter and concluded that the said letter does not offer employment

with the Department.

The Petitioners have sought to argue that the necessity to sign a security bond for a sum

of Rs. 2000 was an indication that they were in fact employees. This position is not

correct, as admitted by the 1st Petitioner himself in his evidence before the Arbitrator

that the security bond was to ensure that the Petitioners completed their training, and

that a failure to complete the training would give the Department the right to encash

the security bond. 14

The Petitioners claim, and this in fact formed the crux of their argument that A1 is a

letter of employment, that paragraph 6 of A1 is a clear promise of employment to

them. The Arbitrator has considered this clause and concluded that that clause does not

mean that the period with the Department would be added to the period of

employment with the CEB. I agree with this conclusion. To my mind, it appears that the

writer of A1 was alive to the fact that the status of the Department may change. This

paragraph makes it clear that in such an eventuality, other than a transfer to the newly

created entity, the Petitioners will not be entitled to claim any benefits on the basis that

their service terms have been abolished.

To my mind, it is clear that what was being offered by A1 was only a one year period of

apprenticeship, or training, at the Training Centre of the Department, at no cost to the 14 Vide page 3 of the proceedings of 17th October 2014 before the Arbitrator - evidence of the 1st Petitioner.

14

trainee. The Petitioners were not being offered employment in the Department, nor

were they being promised employment at the Department, which fact has been very

clearly set out in paragraph 3 of the said letter.

Taking into consideration the totality of the said letter, and especially paragraph 3, I am

of the view that A1 is not a letter of employment and that the conclusion reached by

the Arbitrator with regard to the letter of apprenticeship is therefore reasonable and

rational. Therefore, the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners that the 1st

12th and 16th Petitioners were employees of the Department from 16th August 1968,

and the 13th 15th Petitioners from 8th August 1967 is not supported by the contents of

A1.

The second letter Letter of Employment issued by the Department

The second letter that is relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners has been

issued to the Petitioners by the Department a few weeks after they completed the

period of apprenticeship. The letter issued to the 1st Petitioner, which is identical to the

letters issued to all Petitioners (except the letters issued to the 13th 15th Petitioners),

has been marked A2 before the Arbitrator. The relevant parts of the said letter are re-

produced below:

While the 13th 15th Petitioners too have been issued with similar letters, they are

different from the letters issued to the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners in respect of three

matters.

The first is that the letters of appointment issued to the 13th 15th Petitioners, to be

effective from 15th September 1968, do not specify that the appointments are on an

acting basis. The second is that the said letters specify that the 13th 15th Petitioners

will be confirmed in service at the end of the three year period of probation. The third,

and perhaps the most significant difference is that the letters issued to the 13th 15th

Petitioners provide that once they complete six months of service, they shall be paid a

monthly salary, as opposed to daily pay, and that 5% of their salary will be remitted to

the Public Service Provident Fund.

The Arbitrator has taken the view that in terms of this letter, which is applicable only to

the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners, the said Petitioners have not been employed on a

permanent basis, and therefore the said letters are not letters of employment. I regret

that I cannot agree with the conclusion of the Arbitrator. I take the view that all

Petitioners had a letter of employment issued to them by the Department, subject to

the aforementioned distinctions between the letters issued to the 1st 12th and 16th

Petitioners and the 13th 15th Petitioners.

Paragraph 9 of A2 is identical to paragraph 6 of A1. This clause once again formed the

basis of the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioners that the Petitioners

were promised employment with the new entity, in the event of a change in the status

of the Department. I cannot agree with this position for the same reason as with Clause

6 of A1. The conclusion that I have reached with regard to paragraph 6 of A1 would

apply to paragraph 9 of A2 too, as well. Thus, my view that A2 is a letter of

employment does not make the case of the Petitioners any better, as no assurance of

employment with the successor of the Department has been given to any of the

Petitioners.

The third letter Letter of Employment issued by the CEB

This brings me to the third letter relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners,

which is the letter dated 9th November 1970 issued by the 3rd Respondent, the Ceylon

Electricity Board, to all Petitioners. The letter issued to the 1st Petitioner has been

marked A3 before the Arbitrator, and the relevant parts of the said letter are re-

produced below:

There is no dispute between the parties that A3 is a letter of employment offered by

the CEB. The date of appointment is the date specified therein, which is 1st November

1970. The post is permanent, although subject to a probation period of three years.

Thus, I have no doubt that at least by 1st November 1970, all Petitioners were

employees of the CEB.

17

The Arbitrator has concluded that the first time that the Petitioners received a

permanent appointment, either with the Department or with the CEB, was when the

CEB issued them the letter of appointment on 1st November 1970. The Arbitrator has

thereafter proceeded to state that the Petitioners contributed to the Provident Fund

only once they started employment with the CEB i.e. from 1st November 1970 - and

that the Petitioners have not contributed to the Provident Fund during the period they

were with the Department. He had thereafter referred to the documents that were

before him in support of this conclusion, which is borne out by the following paragraph:

This position is correct as far as the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners are concerned. As far

as the 13th 15th Petitioners were concerned, their letters of appointment issued by the

Department in September 1968, were to a permanent post with entitlement to

Provident Fund. I shall discuss the significance of this in respect of the 13th 15th

Petitioners later in this judgment.

18

Summary of the three letters relied upon by the Petitioners

The factual position with regard to the above three letters can therefore be summarised

as follows.

a) All Petitioners have served a one year period of apprenticeship at the Department

of Government Electrical Undertakings. While this period has ended on 8th August

1968 for the 13th 15th Petitioners, the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners have

completed their one year period of apprenticeship on 16th August 1969. This

period is only a period of apprenticeship and is not a period of employment.

b) The 13th 15th Petitioners have received permanent appointments as employees

of the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings with effect from 15th

September 1968, with an entitlement to Provident Fund.

c) The 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners have received their appointment as employees,

from the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings on 15th September

1969, although on an acting basis and without any entitlement to Provident Fund.

d) All Petitioners were employees, either permanent or acting, of the Department at

the time the CEB came into existence on 1st November 1969.

e) All Petitioners, except the 13th Petitioner, have received their letters of

appointment from the CEB only in November 1970, which is one year after the

establishment of the CEB.

f) None of the above letters contain any provision that the period of employment

with the Department can be added to the period of employment with the CEB.

In the above circumstances and having considered the aforementioned documents, I am

of the view that the decision of the Arbitrator that the Petitioners have not completed

forty years of service with the CEB, either at the CEB alone or cumulatively, is

reasonable. It is certainly a decision which a sensible person who had applied his mind

19

to the question to be decided and very importantly had applied his mind to the

documents and material presented to him, would have arrived at. Therefore, I do not

see any merit in the arguments presented by the learned Counsel for the Petitioners

based on the three letters.

Provisions of the CEB Act

This brings me to the second part of my judgment. It is unfortunate that neither the

Petitioners nor the CEB referred the Arbitrator to the provisions of the Ceylon Electricity

Board Act, which contained provisions relating to employees of the Department.

Therefore, I shall now consider the crucial question whether the Petitioners became

employees of the CEB by virtue of their employment with the Department, and/or

whether their employment with the CEB is in effect a continuation of their employment

that commenced with the Department on 1st November 1969, or 1st November 1968, as

is the case with the 13th 15th Petitioners.

The Ceylon Electricity Board has been established in terms of Section 2(1) of the Ceylon

Electricity Board Act No. 17 of 1969 (the CEB Act). The assent of the Governor General

for the said Act has been given on 6th June 1969. Section 18 of the Act provides that, As

soon as may be convenient after the coming into operation of this Act, the Minister shall,

by Order, transfer the Government Electrical Undertakings to the Board.

The Act was amended for the first time by the Ceylon Electricity Board (Amendment) Act

No. 31 of 1969 (the Amendment Act), for which the assent of the Governor General has

been given on 4th November 1969. There is no dispute between the parties that the CEB

came into being on 1st November 1969.

Section 31A(1) was introduced by the Amendment Act, and the relevant parts of the

said Section are re-produced below:

Every public officer of the Department, not being any such officer in a transferable

service of the Government, shall, before the date on which the Government

Electrical Undertakings are transferred to the Board under Section 18 (in this Act

20

referred to as the " transfer date "), give notice in writing to the General Manager

of the Department that such officer intends, on that date-

(c) to leave the public service and become an employee of the Board if, being a

pensionable officer of the Department, he would on that date have less than

ten years' pensionable service; or

(d) to leave the public service and become an employee of the Board if he is a

contributor to the Public Service Provident Fund established under the Public

Service Provident Fund Ordinance; ...

I shall now consider Section 31C(1) introduced by the Amendment Act. The relevant

parts of Section 31C(1) are set out below:

Any public officer of the Department who gives notice under any of the

paragraphs (b) to (e) of subsection (1) of section 31A before the transfer date shall,

(b) if such notice is so given by him under paragraph (c) of that subsection,

become an employee of the Board on that date and shall be deemed to have

left the public service on that date and shall, subject to the provisions of

section 32, be eligible for such an award under the Minutes on Pensions as

would have been awarded to him if he had left the public service on the

ground of abolition of office on that date; or

c) if such notice is so given by him under paragraph (d) of that subsection,

become an employee of the Board on that date, and shall be deemed for the

purposes of the Public Service Provident Fund to have left the service of the

Government upon the determination of contract with the consent of the

Government otherwise than by dismissal

Section 32 of the CEB Act was repealed by the Amendment Act, and replaced with the

following:

21

The following provisions shall apply to and in relation to any employee of the

Board who became such an employee on the transfer date by virtue of the

operation of the provisions of section 31C:

(1) Such employee shall be employed by the Board on such terms and conditions

as may be agreed upon by such employee and the Board:

Provided, however, that such terms and conditions shall be not less

favourable than the terms and conditions on which such employee was

previously employed in the Department..

The above provisions could therefore be summarised as follows:

a) None of the Petitioners would qualify under Section 31A(1)(c) above as they were

not holding a pensionable post in the Department;

b) The 13th 15th Petitioners were contributing to the Public Service Provident Fund,

and were eligible to give a notice in terms of Section 31A(1)(d) of the Amendment

Act, seeking a transfer to the CEB;

c) The 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners however would not be entitled to seek a transfer

as they do not fall within paragraphs (c) or (d) of Section 31A(1);

d) Assuming the 13th 15th Petitioners gave notice in terms of Section 31A(1)(d), they

would have become employees of the CEB on the Transfer Date. As noted earlier,

the Transfer Date is the date on which the Government Electrical Undertakings are

transferred to the CEB in terms of Section 18;

(e) The CEB Act and the Amendment Act do not provide that the employment by the

CEB of the 13th 15th Petitioners is a continuation of the employment that they

had with the Department and/or that the period of employment that the

Petitioners had with the Department can be added to their period of employment

with the CEB;

22

(f) The argument of the Petitioners that Clause 6 of A1 and paragraph 9 of A2 assured them of employment with the entity that was to be created to succeed to the Department is not supported by the provisions of the CEB Act or the Amendment Act; (g) All Petitioners became employees of the CEB only on 1st November 1970. Although none of the Petitioners have claimed that they acted in terms of Section 31A(1), in paragraph 3 of its Statement of Objections, the Respondents have stated as follows:

(ii) that every Public Officer in service in the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings as at the said date, were required to give notice in terms of the provisions of the aforesaid Act No. 17 of 1969 indicating preferences from among the options for continuity in service or for termination made available in the said Act; (iii) it is only the 13th, 14th and 15th Petitioners who were in a position to benefit from this scheme as they were the only employees functioning in the capacity of public officers of the Department of Government Electrical Undertakings at the time of setting up of the 3rd Respondent Board. (iv) That the other Petitioners named in the petition were serving the Department only in the capacity of trainees/apprentices and not as part of the permanent cadre of public officers. (v) That therefore the possibility of absorption vis-a-vis the provisions of the said Act was only available in regards to the 13th, 14th and 15th Petitioners and that they have not elected to take the option of remaining in public service whilst being absorbed by the newly created entity. (vi) That the 1st 12th and 16th Respondents were never employed as public officers of the Department and were not absorbed into the newly established Board.

23

(vii) That the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners were awarded contracts of service for the first time by the 3rd Respondent after it was established in 1969. The position of the CEB that the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners were not absorbed into the CEB has not been contradicted by the Petitioners. I shall now consider the cases of all Petitioners in the light of the material that has been tendered to this Court by the CEB with its Statement of Objections, the affidavit dated 27th January 2020 of the General Manager of the CEB and the motion dated 16th October 2020, in order to ascertain if the said documents displace the position that all Petitioners became employees of the CEB only on 1st November 1970. I shall commence with the 13th Petitioner, T.W. Fernando. The 13th Petitioner has been issued with: (a) A letter of appointment by the Department with effect from 15th September 1968,

with the right to contribute to the Provident Fund; (b) A letter of appointment dated 29th December 1969 marked 3R13B by the CEB,

with his date of appointment in the CEB being 1st November 1969. Thus, there can be no doubt that the 13th Petitioner was an employee of the CEB with effect from 1st November 1969 and had completed forty years of service with the CEB as at 1st November 2009. The 13th Petitioner was therefore eligible to be felicitated for completing forty years of service and to be awarded a gold coin. The Pension and Provident Fund entitlement of the 13th Petitioner has been calculated on the basis of the date of appointment being 1st November 1969 vide 9XC. No further adjustment is therefore required to his Pension or Provident Fund. Although a letter similar to 3R13B has not been produced in respect of the 14th Petitioner, the position of the 13th Petitioner should apply to the 14th Petitioner H. Wijesoma, in view of the aforementioned position taken by the CEB in its Statement of Objections, and the 14th Petitioner being entitled to Provident Fund under the Department vide document marked X14a tendered with the motion dated 16th October 2020. Even if the date of appointment of the 14th Petitioner could be taken as

24

1st November 1969, a period of two years has been deducted from his service as the 14th Petitioner has been on no-pay leave, thus reducing his period of employment to 38 years vide 14XA. The 14th Petitioner would therefore not be entitled to the benefits afforded to those who had completed forty years of service as at 1st November 2009. The 15th Petitioner, P.S. Wasalamudali is similarly circumstanced as the 13th and 14th Petitioners,15 except that his date of appointment in the CEB, as per the Pension Award 15XB is 1st December 1969. The 15th Petitioner therefore was short of one month of forty years of service as at 1st November 2009. In any event, the 15th Petitioner has been on no pay leave for two years for employment abroad, which period has been deducted from his service, and therefore the 15th Petitioner has only completed 38 years vide 15XB. The 15th Petitioner too is therefore not entitled to the benefits afforded to those who had completed forty years of service as at 1st November 2009. The 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners have not produced any material to prove that they had been absorbed to the CEB, nor have they produced a letter of appointment issued to them by the CEB, appointing them to a post within the CEB with effect from 1st November 1969. The only letter of appointment issued to the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners by the CEB is the letter of appointment dated 1st November 1970 (i.e. the third letter). Even in the absence of letters of appointment issued by the CEB offering employment with effect from 1st November 1969, and even though the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners were issued with letters of appointment only in November 1970, the 1st 12th and 16th Petitioners could still have presented evidence to demonstrate that they in fact worked at the CEB with effect from 1st November 1969. The Petitioners have however failed to do so. I shall now consider the Pension Award and the Provident Fund Form submitted with the affidavit of the General Manager of the CEB, in order to determine if the position would have been different had that material been presented to the Arbitrator. I shall commence with the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 9th Petitioners, whose position is demonstrated by the following table:

15 A letter similar to 3R13B has not been produced in respect of the 15th Petitioner.

25

Thus, in the preparation of the Pension Award, the CEB has acted on the basis that the date of appointment of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 9th Petitioners is 1st November 1969. While this Court has not been apprised of the reason for taking the date as 1st November 1969, the Pension and Provident Fund entitlements have been calculated on the basis of the date of appointment being 1st November 1969 for a period of forty years. The 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 9th Petitioners would therefore be entitled to be felicitated with a gold coin, in view of the said acknowledgement by the CEB that the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 9th Petitioners have completed forty years of service with the CEB as at 1st November 2009. No adjustment is required to the Provident Fund and Pension entitlements of these Petitioners as their period of service has been taken as forty years. The 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 9th Petitioners would not be entitled to gratuity as they have agreed to forfeit their right to gratuity by accepting the commuted pension. According to the Pension Award marked 16XC of the 12th Petitioner, K.J. Lionel, his date of Appointment in the CEB is 1st November 1969. He has been on no pay leave for six years for employment abroad, which period has been deducted, and therefore the 12th Petitioner has only completed 34 years. The 12th Petitioner would therefore not be entitled to the benefits of those who had completed forty years of service.

16 This date is erroneous for the reasons that I have already given.

26

The Pensions Award and the Provident Fund Award pertaining to the 1st Petitioner

(1XC and 1XE), 3rd Petitioner (3XC and 3XD), 5th Petitioner (5XC and 5XD), 7th

Petitioner (7XC and 7XD), 10th Petitioner (12XC and 12XD), 11th Petitioner (13XC

and 13XD) and the 16th Petitioner (10XB and 10XC) gives their date of appointment

in the CEB as 1st November 1970. Thus, there is no change to the conclusion reached by

the Arbitrator with regard to the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 11th and 16th Petitioners.

I therefore direct the CEB to present the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 9th and 13th Petitioners with a

gold coin, within three months of today. Subject to the above, this application is

dismissed, without costs.
