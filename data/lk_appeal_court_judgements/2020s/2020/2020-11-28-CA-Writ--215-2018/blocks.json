No adjustment is required to the Provident Fund and Pension entitlements of these Petitioners as their period of service has been taken as forty years. The 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 9th Petitioners would not be entitled to gratuity as they have agreed to forfeit their right to gratuity by accepting the commuted pension. According to the Pension Award marked 16XC of the 12th Petitioner, K.J. Lionel, his date of Appointment in the CEB is 1st November 1969. He has been on no pay leave for six years for employment abroad, which period has been deducted, and therefore the 12th Petitioner has only completed 34 years. The 12th Petitioner would therefore not be entitled to the benefits of those who had completed forty years of service.",
