*********

Hon. K.K. Wickremasinghe, J

Counsel appearing for the Petitioner submits that the learned

High Court Judge has given the maximum sentence to the alleged

offence. The learned Counsel has filed a revision application instead of

an appeal. Further there is no averment with regard to the exceptional

circumstances in his petition. The above mentioned facts submitted by

the learned Counsel does not amount to establish a prima facie case to

issue notice to respondents. Therefore, this application is hereby

dismissed without costs.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of the order to the

relevant High Court.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Hon. Devika Abeyratne, J
