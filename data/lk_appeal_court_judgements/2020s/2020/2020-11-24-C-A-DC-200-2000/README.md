This is an appeal referred by the Plaintiff Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) against the judgment dated 3" May 2000 by the District Judge of Kuliyapitiya .

The Plaintiff by his Plaint instituted an action seeking to partition a land called Pahalawelawatte in Siyabalagasruppe. At the commencement of the trial, two admissions were recorded. For the Plaintiff, first and second issues of contest were raised and for the third Defendant issue No. 3 -15 were raised. For the 5'h Defendant issue no. 14-17 were raised. Considering the Defendant's issues, the Plaintiff decided to raise consequential issues from 18- 21.

At the end of the trial the Learned District Judge pronounced the judgement dismissing the action mainly on the ground that the Plaintiff hasn't possessed the land in dispute. Being aggrieved by that judgment the Plaintiff filed this appeal.

In the Preliminary Plan which was marked as X prepared by Licensed Surveyor S.B Abeykoon on 20'h August 1985 bearing No. 522/85, there were 5 Lots and Lot 1 was possessed by the Plaintiff. Lot 3 was possessed by the second Defendant. It was erroneous for the Learned District Judge to declare that the Plaintiff never possessed the disputed land.

Considering the District Court Case No. 3358/P marked as P3, during the trial, explained that Bandihamy was a child of Jothihamy who was entitled to undivided Y, share of that Partition Action which was concluded some time back. Another child namely Kirimenika also received shares from the same land from Herathsingho, who is a son of Bandihamy and the Plaintiff is also considered to be another

beneficiary who received shares from the same land in that previous partition action.

The Plaintiff has obtained title by deeds marked P1 and P2 by Deed No. 3980, which was marked as P1, the original Plaintiff has purchased undivided 1/8'h share of the disputed land called Pahalawelawatte. It

is evident that by Deed bearing No. 4396, which was marked as P2, the original Plaintiff has obtained another 1/8'h share from the disputed property. The Learned Trial Judge erroneously answered the issue NO.2. When we consider the evidence, it is crystal clear that the long and continued possession of the disputed land to obtain prescriptive title was established by evidence.

Witness Wijepala who gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff confirms the proper pedigree and the devolution of title on the parties relevant to this Partition action. It is important to note that the witness

3

Wijepala produced Deed No. 1900 marked as P4 to prove that Ranmenika has transferred a share of the disputed land to Martheewan Fernando.

According to the evidence, the Deed No. 50 was marked as P4. The Defendants did not cross examine the witness who were to be added as P4 and P4 (a).

In the end of the Plaintiffs case, the Defendant did not give or lead any evidence. It is my view that the Learned Trial Judge errored in law stating that the Plaintiff has not proved the inheritance and the devolution of the title under the Kandyan Law. It is the duty of the Defendant to prove the Deega marriage on the Defendants, but they failed to do so. The Defendants who should prove the Deega marriage and it

is their duty to produce the marriage certificates under the Kandyan Law.

In those circumstances it is clear that although the Learned Trial judge has dismissed the action on a wrongful footing, I am of the opinion that the land sought to be partitioned should not have been dismissed. Therefore, the impugned judgment of the Learned District Judge is erroneous. We set aside the judgment dated 3,d May 2000 by the District Judge of Awissawella and the judgment should be entered

in favor of the Plaintiff as follows.

Substituted Plaintiff Appellant undivided 1/4'h First Defendant undivided 1/4'h Second Defendant undivided 1/4'h Third Defendant undivided 1/16'h Fourth Defendant undivided 1/16'h Fifth defendant undivided 1/8'h (minus block of land for 10 coconut trees) Enter interlocutory decree accordingly;

Appeal allowed. The Plaintiff is entitled for costs in the District Court as well as in the appeal and the surveyor fees
