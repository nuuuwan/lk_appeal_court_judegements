In the instant case the Accused-Appellant indicted for committing

murder of his own father. This case was a jury trial. When this case came

up in the High Court of Galle, Dr. Neil Fernando had testified that the

Appellant was suffering from schizophrenia and therefore he was not in a

normal state of mind at the time he was committing the offence. The

counsel for the Appellant submitted that Actus reus was admitted at the

trial but mens rea was challenged by the defence on insanity. When the

learned High Court Judge was summing up the jury, he has not directed the

jury on the defence of insanity and thereby there is a fatal non direction by

the learned High Court Judge. Therefore, no direction had been given on the

standards of proof on the defence of insanity. There is clear evidence by

Dr. Neil Fernando about the condition of the Accused-Appellant with regard

to his insanity where the learned High Court Judge has not adequately

referred to the jury in his summing up. Also it can be considered as a

misdirection on the standards of proof directed to the jury. The available

evidence does not warrant to send this case for re-trial.

Considering the above facts, it is evident that under these

circumstances, the conviction cannot stand. Accordingly, we set aside the

conviction for murder against the Accused-Appellant.

Accordingly, the Accused-Appellant is acquitted. However, it is an

admitted fact that the act was committed by the Accused. Therefore, this

Court directs the Registrar to send this case back to the High Court to act

under Section 381 and 382 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the learned

High Court Judge and the Prison Authorities.

Prison Authorities is directed to produce the Accused-Appellant

before the High Court of Galle on 12.02.2020.
