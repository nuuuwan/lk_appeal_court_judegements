The issue that arises for the determination of this Court is whether the

Respondents have followed the procedure laid down in the Land Development

Ordinance (the Ordinance) when cancelling the permit issued to the Petitioner.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

In April 1997, the State had issued the brother-in-law of the Petitioner, A.

Ganeshapillai a permit marked P2 under the provisions of the Ordinance in

respect of a land in extent of 1A situated in the Divisional Secretariat area of

Vavuniya North. The said permit had subsequently been re-issued in the name

of the Petitioner. The Petitioner states that due to the escalation of the conflict

between the Government and the LTTE terrorists in 1999, the lands

3

surrounding the above land had been taken over by the Security Forces, with

the result that the Petitioner could not enter the land. The Petitioner had been

permitted to return to the area where the said land was situated only in July

2010. As the land allocated to the Petitioner by the said permit P2 continued

to be used for security purposes by the Security Forces, the Petitioner had

requested that an alternate land be allocated to her.

The Petitioner states that as she had no other land, in December 2010 she had

occupied an uninhabited land situated approximately 3km from the land

referred to in P2. Having constructed a house on the said land, the Petitioner

claims that she cultivated the land with short term and long term crops. It is

not in dispute that the occupation of the second land was reguralised by the

Respondents and that the necessary amendments to P2 including the

description of the land and its boundaries were effected on P2.

The Petitioner states that in May 2013, her occupation of the said land had

been interrupted by third parties, at the instigation of a Coordinating Secretary

of a Minister. Upon a complaint made by Ganeshapillai Leelawathie, the sister-

in-law of the Petitioner, the Kanagarayankulam Police, having conducted an

investigation, had filed a B report in the Magistrates Court of Vavuniya in

September 2013, in respect of the said incidents.

The Petitioner states that soon after the said incident, she received the

following letter dated 17th June 2013 marked P9 from the 1st Respondent:

Reference to the above, while Army camp was erected on the land

bearing permit No. VN/225A/ER/LDO/22 situated at Periyakulam village,

Kanakayankulam North Grama Sevaka division, you have encroached

another land along the A9 road. The Rural Development Society has

4

complained that the said land was allocated for public use. I respectfully

request you not to carry out any development work in this land till an

answer in respect of this land is found.

The 1st Respondent had thereafter issued to the Petitioner the following letter

dated 9th July 2013 marked P10:

Ref. to the above, while Army camp was erected on the land containing in

extent 2 acres and bearing permit No. VN/225/A/ER/LDO/22, situated at

Periyakulam Village, Kanakayankulam North Grama Sevaka Division,

another land bounded (by the) milk collecting centre, health centre,

preschool and near JaffnaKandy Road was encroached. Further, Rural

Development Society has requested to release the said land for public use

of the Society and to evict you from the said land. On the telephone

conversation with Mr. Muththu Mohamed Master, Coordinator to the

Hon. Rishad Bathiuththeen, Hon. Minister of Industry & Commerce and

President, Development Committee, Vavuniya District, on 12.06.2013 it

was instructed to give the said land to the Rural Development Society for

use it for public purpose. According to the above instruction and

considering the public welfare you are sincerely requested to leave the

said land without causing hindrance to the peace and I further inform you

that a suitable land will be given to you at another location in compliance

with Circular No. 2013/01, issued by the Commissioner General of Lands.

P10 had been followed by a further letter dated 18th July 2013 marked P11

sent by the 1st Respondent to the Human Rights Commission, where it was

admitted that the description of the land on the permit P2 had been

amended to the land that the Petitioner had encroached, and that the 1st

5

Respondent does not have any objection to the said land being given to the

Petitioner. However, the said letter goes onto state as follows:

Mrs. Alagurani Amirthalingam has sent me an application requesting to

grant the above said land to her as an alternative land since the land

belonging to her was taken by the military. Accordingly, as per the letter

of Hon. Deputy Minister of Resettlement No. VN/MR/DS/ 2012 dated

21.02.2012 the boundaries of encroached land were recorded and

amended in the permit bearing No. VN/225/ER/LDO-22 and reissued.

However, Rural Development Society, Kanakarayankulam, Senior Citizen

Society, Kanakarayankulam, Women Development Society,

Kanakarayankulam and Farmers Movement, Kanakarayankulam have

said that the said land was allocated for public use and requested to

release it.

Further, Livestock Cooperative Society (Milk Collecting Centre),

Kanakarayankulam have made a request stating that they need an

additional land to extend their development work.

The above position had been reiterated by the 1st Respondent in a further

letter dated 21st August 2013, marked P13. It is thus clear that pressure was

brought upon the Petitioner to vacate the said land, although by then, the

Government had issued the Petitioner with a permit in respect of the said land.

The undue influence exerted on the Petitioner continued with the 1st

Respondent informing the Petitioner that steps will be taken under the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended, to evict the

Petitioner from the said land.

6

The issue that culminated in this application started in January 2014 when the

1st Respondent, by notice dated 22nd January 2014 marked P19, issued in

terms of Section 106 of the Ordinance, directed the Petitioner to show cause

on or before 26th February 2014 why the permit should not be cancelled. It is

noted that the grounds on which the said permit could be cancelled have been

set out in the Schedule to the Permit P2, and includes cancellation as a result

of violating and/or failing to observe any conditions of the permit. The

Petitioner has also stated that annexed to P19 was a blank form titled, Order

Cancelling Permit, which is issued under Section 109 of the Land Development

Ordinance, even though such an order had not been made by then.

Even though the Petitioner by her letter dated 1st February 2014 marked P22a

had appealed to the 1st Respondent to withdraw P19 for the reasons set out

therein, the Petitioner had not presented herself before the Inquiry scheduled

for 26th February 2014. The Petitioner however claims that she submitted a

medical certificate, seeking to excuse herself from the inquiry. The receipt of

the medical certificate has not been denied by the Respondents, even though

the learned State Counsel did challenge the authenticity and genuineness of

the said medical certificate. He submitted further that the medical certificate

does not support the fact that the medical condition of the Petitioner is

preventing her from attending the inquiry scheduled for 26th February 2014.

The Respondents have submitted that as the Petitioner did not present herself

at the inquiry held on 26th February 2014, the 1st Respondent had cancelled the

permit on 14th March 2014, by the cancellation order marked 1R11. The

Petitioner however states that she did not receive a notice informing her that

the permit has been cancelled.

7

The Petitioner states that she was thereafter served with a notice issued under

Section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act seeking to eject her

from the land. The 1st Respondent had thereafter filed action in the

Magistrates Court, Vavuniya in terms of the said Act, and an order has been

made by the learned Magistrate of Vavuniya on 25th February 2015 ejecting

the Petitioner from the said land.

It is in these circumstances that the Petitioner filed this application, seeking

inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the notice P19 issued to the Petitioner

calling her to show cause why the permit P2 should not be canceled;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent to cancel

the permit P2.

The arguments of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner essentially revolve

around a) the failure on the part of the Respondents to follow the procedure

laid down in the Ordinance, and b) the failure by the Respondents to inform

the Petitioner the reasons for the cancellation of the permit.

As observed in De Smiths Judicial Review1:

Procedural justice, or procedural fairness, has to be contrasted with

substantive justice. The general objective of substantive justice is to

ensure that the decisions of public authorities are within the scope of the

powers conferred on those authorities. Substantive justice ensures that

those powers are not exceeded. Procedural justice aims to provide

8

individuals with a fair opportunity to influence the outcome of a

decision and so ensure the decisions integrity.

This would be a convenient place for me to discuss the procedure set out in

Chapter VIII of the Ordinance with regard to the cancellation of a permit. The

first step that must be taken in terms of Chapter VIII is to act in terms of

Section 106 of the Land Development Ordinance, which reads as follows:

If it appears to the Government Agent that a permit-holder has failed to

observe a condition of the permit, the Government Agent may issue a

notice in the prescribed form intimating to such permit-holder that his

permit will be cancelled unless sufficient cause to the contrary is shown to

the Government Agent on a date and at a time and place specified in such

notice.

Section 107 provides that, The date specified in a notice issued under

subsection (2) of section 106 shall not be less than forty-two days from the date

of the issue of such notice on the permit-holder.

Section 108 specifies that, A copy of every notice issued under section 106

shall be served on the permit-holder and a copy shall also be affixed in a

conspicuous position on the land affected by such notice. The Government

Agent may also cause a copy of such notice to be served on any person who, in

his opinion, is interested in the land or may be affected by a cancellation of the

permit.

The Ordinance thereafter draws a distinction between a person who fails to

appear on the date specified in the notice issued under Section 106, or who

having appeared does not show cause, and a person who appears on the date

9

specified in the notice issued under Section 106, and shows cause as to why

the permit should not be cancelled.

The first situation is set out in Section 109(1), which reads as follows:

If the permit-holder fails to appear on the date and at the time and place

specified in a notice issued under section 106, or appears and states that

he has no cause to show why his permit should not be cancelled, the

Government Agent may, if he is satisfied that there has been due service

of such notice and that there has been a breach of any of the conditions

of the permit, make order cancelling such permit but no such order shall

be made until after the expiry of a period of twenty-eight days reckoned

from the date specified in the notice issued under section 106.

However, a permit holder who does not appear on the date specified in the

notice issued under Section 106 has been provided with a remedy by Section

109(2) of the Ordinance, which reads as follows:

If, within a period of fourteen days reckoned from the date specified in

the notice issued under section 106, the permit-holder satisfies the

Government Agent that he has cause to show why his permit should not

be cancelled and that he was prevented by accident, illness, misfortune or

other unavoidable cause from appearing on the date and at the time and

place specified in such notice, the Government Agent shall appoint

another date, time and place for the purpose of enabling the permit-

holder to show cause why his permit should not be cancelled.

The reason why the decision taken in terms of Section 109(1) is not given

effect for a period of 28 days appears to be to accommodate a request made

by the permit holder in terms of Section 109(2).

10

It is noted that in terms of Section 117, No appeal shall lie against an order of

cancellation made by the Government Agent under section 109 but such order

shall be final and conclusive for all purposes. Thus, a permit holder who does

not present himself at the inquiry, and who does not thereafter take steps in

terms of Section 109(2) to purge his default cannot avail himself of the right of

appeal that is available under Section 113.

The procedure that should be followed when a permit holder appears at the

time and place specified in the notice issued under Section 106 is set out in

Section 110(1) of the Ordinance which reads as follows:

If on the date and at the time and place specified in a notice issued under

section 106 or appointed by the Government Agent under section 109 (2)

the permit-holder appears and offers to show cause why his permit should

not be cancelled, the Government Agent may, if he is satisfied after

inquiry that there has been a breach of any of the conditions of the

permit, make order cancelling the permit.

The manner in which evidence can be received at the inquiry that the

Divisional Secretary is required to conduct is set out in Section 110(2).

Section 112(1) requires that A copy of an order made by a Government Agent

under section 110 shall be served forthwith on the permit-holder and a copy of

such order shall also be affixed forthwith in a conspicuous position on the land

affected by such order. Every copy so served or affixed shall contain a

statement to the effect that an appeal from such order will lie to the Land

Commissioner if preferred within a period of thirty days reckoned from the date

of the order and such date shall be specified in such statement.

11

Section 113 of the Ordinance provides that a permit-holder aggrieved by an

order made by the Government Agent under section 110 may appeal therefrom

to the Land Commissioner. The mode of preferring an appeal and the time

period for preferring an appeal is set out in Section 114 of the Ordinance.

Section 115 of the Ordinance sets out the powers of the Land Commissioner in

determining an appeal. In terms of Section 116(2) of the Ordinance, any

decision made by the Land Commissioner under section 115 shall be final and

conclusive for all purposes.

I shall now consider each of the complaints of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner that the procedure laid down in the Ordinance has not been

observed.

The first complaint is that the notice issued under Section 106 P19- does not

set out the conditions of the permit that the Petitioner has failed to observe.

Given the fact that the purpose of such a notice is to enable the permit holder

to show sufficient cause as to why the permit should not be cancelled, I am of

the view that it is mandatory that the said notice contains details relating to

the violations of the conditions of the permit. I have examined P19 and

observe that P19 does not contain the conditions of the permit that the

Petitioner had failed to observe and is a blank document. Without P19

specifying the conditions of the permit that had been violated, this Court is at a

loss to understand how the Divisional Secretary could have satisfied himself

that there has been a breach of any of the conditions of the permit. Therefore,

I am in agreement with the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the

provisions of Section 106 have not been complied with by the 1st Respondent

and that P19 is liable to be quashed, on this ground.

12

The second complaint is that P19 does not comply with the provisions of

Section 107. P19 is dated 22nd January 2014 whereas the inquiry had been

fixed for 26th February 2014. This is a clear violation of Section 107 which

requires the inquiry to be conducted 42 days after the date of the notice issued

under Section 106.

The third complaint of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

Petitioner did write P22(a) on 1st February 2014 explaining her position, and

that even though the Petitioner did not come for the inquiry on 26th February

2014, she did tender a medical certificate. It was submitted that, in these

circumstances, the 1st Respondent ought to have re-fixed the inquiry as

provided for in Section 109(2) unless the 1st Respondent was of the view that

the medical certificate is not authentic in which event the 1st Respondent

should have rejected the medical certificate and informed the Petitioner of

such fact. Given the fact that the Petitioner did submit a response to P19, and

a medical certificate, I am of the view that the Divisional Secretary ought to

have acted in terms of Section 109(2) and re-fixed the inquiry, for the simple

reason that it was paramount that the Petitioner was afforded a hearing prior

to the cancellation of the permit.

The fourth complaint was that a time period of 28 days must lapse prior to an

order being made in terms of Section 109(1). As noted earlier, the inquiry is

said to have been held on 26th February 2014 and the order 1R11 had been

delivered on 14th March 2014. Thus, the 1st Respondent has further violated

the provisions of Section 109(1).

The final complaint of the Petitioner was that although Section 112(1) requires

every order made under Section 110, i.e. after an inquiry with the participation

13

of the permit holder, to be conveyed to the permit holder, the Ordinance is

silent with regard to such a requirement in respect of an Order made under

Section 109(1). However, given the consequence of such an Order, and the fact

that a permit holder has no right of appeal, I am of the view that a copy of the

Order made in terms of Section 109(1) should have been served on the

Petitioner.

Sripavan J (as he was then), in the case of Ratnayake v. Commissioner General

of Excise and Others2, citing a paragraph from his own judgment in Gamlathge

Ranjith Gamlath v. Commissioner General of Excise and two others3, held as

follows:

It is one of the fundamental principles in the administration of justice

that an administrative body which is to decide must hear both sides and

give an opportunity of hearing before a decision is taken. No man can

incur a loss of property by judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings unless and

until he has had a fair opportunity of answering the complaint made

against him. Thus, objectors at public inquiries must be given a fair

opportunity to meet adverse evidence, even though the statutory

provisions do not cover the case expressly. (vide Errington v. Minister of

Health)4. The court would certainly regard any decision as having grave

consequences if it affects proprietary rights.

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, I am of the view that

the 1st Respondent has disregarded the mandatory provisions of the

Ordinance, and thereby deprived the Petitioner of a fair opportunity to

influence the outcome of the decision and so ensure the decisions integrity.

2 [2004] 1 Sri LR 115, pages 117-118. 3 CA (Writ) Application No. 1675/02; CA Minutes of 28th March 2003. 4 [1935] 1 KB 249.

14

The second argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

Order cancelling the permit, 1R11 does not contain any reasons. I have

examined 1R11 and find that this argument is correct.

In Bank Mellat v. Her Majestys Treasury5, a majority of five judges of the

United Kingdom Supreme Court held as follows:

The duty of fairness governing the exercise of a statutory power is a

limitation on the discretion of the decision-maker which is implied into the

statute. But the fact that the statute makes some provision for the

procedure to be followed before or after the exercise of a statutory power

does not of itself impliedly exclude either the duty of fairness in general or

the duty of prior consultation in particular, where they would otherwise

arise. As Byles J observed in Cooper v Board of Works for the Wandsworth

District (1863) 14 CB(NS) 190, 194, the justice of the common law will

supply the omission of the legislature. In Lloyd v McMahon [1987] 1 AC

625,702-3, Lord Bridge of Harwich regarded it as well established that

when a statute has conferred on any body the power to make decisions

affecting individuals, the courts will not only require the procedure

prescribed by statute to be followed, but will readily imply so much and no

more to be introduced by way of additional procedural safeguards as will

ensure the attainment of fairness.

Thus, even where the Statute does not expressly require reasons, I am of the

view that administrative bodies must give reasons for its decision to those

affected by such decision, and that failure to do so would result in the

impugned decision being liable to be quashed. In this application, the failure to

5 [2013] UKSC 39 at para 35.

15

give reasons becomes critical in the light of the attempts by the 1st Respondent

to hand over the said land to the Rural Development Society.

As stated in De Smiths Judicial Review6:

The beneficial effects of a duty to give reasons are many. To have to

provide an explanation of the basis for their decisions is a salutary

discipline for those who have to decide anything that adversely affects

others. The giving of reasons is widely regarded as one of the principles of

good administration in that it encourages a careful examination of the

relevant issues, the elimination of extraneous considerations, and

consistency in decision-making. If published, reasons can provide guidance

to others on the bodys future decisions, and so deter applications which

would be unsuccessful. The giving of reasons may protect the body from

unjustified challenges, because those adversely affected are more likely to

accept a decision if they know why it has been taken. Basic fairness and

respect for the individual often requires that those in authority over others

should tell them why they are subject to some liability or have been

refused some benefit: in short, justice will not be done if it is not apparent

to the parties why one has won and the other has lost.7 The giving of

reasons increases public confidence in the decision-making process.8

In Benedict and Others v. Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka

and Others (Pramuka Bank case)9, this Court held as follows:

6Supra, page 442. 7English [2002] EWCA Civ 605; [2002] 1 WLR 2409 at [16]. 8Stefan [1999] 1 WLR 1293 at 1300; Secretary of State for the Home Department v CC [2014] EWCA Civ 559 at [38] [39]. 9 [2003] 3 Sri LR 68, page 78.

16

Failure to give adequate reasons therefore amounts to a denial of justice

and is itself an error of law. The reasons must not only be intelligible but

should deal with the substantial points which have been raised. The courts

have treated inadequacy of reasons as an error on the face of record so

that inadequately reasoned decision could be quashed, even if the duty to

give reasons was not mandatory.

As noted earlier, P19 does not set out the conditions that have been violated

by the Petitioner, nor does 1R11 set out the reasons for cancellation of the

permit. While 1R11 is liable to be quashed due to the failure to give reasons,

the absence of reasons clearly demonstrates that the Divisional Secretary did

not have any basis to be satisfied that there has been a breach of the condition

of the permit, which is a requirement that must be satisfied both in terms of

Section 109(1), as well as under Section 110(1).

The learned State Counsel did not contest the fact that the Respondents have

acted in violation of the aforementioned procedure laid down in the

Ordinance. He however submitted that the land which is the subject matter of

this application had been reserved for a public purpose and could not have

been given to the Petitioner in the first place. He submitted that the Petitioner

is guilty of several irregularities, and that the change of the land and the

boundaries on P2 had been effected by the Petitioners brother-in-law, who

was the Grama Niladhari for the area. This however does not appear to be

correct for the reason that the endorsement amending the boundaries etc had

been made by the 1st Respondent. He submitted further that even though the

permit had been issued in the name of the Petitioner, she was not in

occupation of the said land, and that it was her brother-in-law, Ganeshapillai,

who was occupying the said land. He submitted further that the Petitioner has

violated the conditions of the permit by seeking to alienate the said property

17

to her sister-in-law, and in these circumstances submitted that the Petitioner

has not come before this Court with clean hands. In essence, the submission of

the learned State Counsel was that this Court should refrain from exercising its

discretion in favour of the Petitioner.

Even if the Petitioner deliberately kept away from the inquiry, which does not

appear to be the case, I cannot disregard the antecedent circumstances

surrounding the cancellation, which I have referred to earlier in this judgment,

and the collateral purpose for taking steps under the Ordinance, namely the

land being required for the Rural Development Society. Nor can I disregard the

fact that the provisions of the Ordinance have been violated with impunity, as

already noted, and a sham inquiry conducted to enable steps to be taken

under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to eject the Petitioner from

the said land, and thereby achieve the collateral purpose.

This Court, in KIA Motors (Lanka) Limited vs Consumer Affairs Authority and

Others10 has stated that, Authorities acting on behalf of the public ought to be

accountable for the overall quality of the decision making process. While Courts

must be mindful not to substitute its own decision for that of the public

authority, this must be balanced with Courts taking an active role in probing

the quality of decisions of public authorities, and ensuring that actions of public

authorities are properly substantiated, justified, and strike a fair balance

between parties. I am of the view that the above view should be extended

with equal force to ensure due adherence with the procedure laid down in an

Act of Parliament. Public Officers cannot and should not be allowed to act in

complete disregard of the laid down procedure, and make a mockery of the

Rule of Law.

10 CA (Writ) Application NO. 72/2013; CA Minutes of 26th May 2020.

18

I therefore grant a Writ of Certiorari quashing the notice issued under Section

106 of the Ordinance marked P19, and the Order cancelling the permit

marked 1R11. All steps taken thereafter to eject the Petitioner from the said

land, including the notice to eject the Petitioner issued under the provisions of

the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act shall not be of any force. The

Respondents shall be free to take steps against the Petitioner in terms of the

Ordinance, if they are of the view that the Petitioner has violated the

provisions of the permit P2. I make no order with regard to costs.
