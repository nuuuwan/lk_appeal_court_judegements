This is an appeal filed by the Petitioner arising out of a judgment

of the High Court on Extradition Law. Being aggrieved by the order of

the learned High Court Judge the Respondent - Petitioner has filed this

appeal before this Court. Though they called this as an appeal, this has

to be a Revision Application. Accordingly, since this is an order of the

High Court under Extradition Law, Counsel for the Petitioner has to

establish a prima facia case in order to issue notice to the Respondent

(Hon. Attorney General).

The applicant - respondent in this case has made an application under

the Extradition Law to extradite the above named Respondent -

Petitioner to Australia, on the alleged complains concerning defrauding

public authority namely, the Australian postal co operating and causing

loss.

Learned President's Counsel appearing for the Petitioner informs

Court that this is an application under Extradition Law and the learned

High Court Judge of Colombo has not acted legally and therefore he

makes an application to issue notice to the respondent of this case. He

further states that the warrant issued by the Australian Magistrate's

Court is not bearing a date and the warrant is undated (as at page 28 of

document marked "P") and also there was no evidence led under oath to

be produced before the issuance of warrant, according to the Section

61 of the Magistrate's Court Act (marked document 'C').

The Learned High Court Judge had not considered the above

mentioned Legal requirements when making the order. Also the Sri

Lankan Authorities had not been provided with the relevant documents;

thereby the Learned High Court Judge was unable to look in to the

relevant documents. Pecuniary penalty finally concluded, under

proceedings of Crimes Act 2002 Section 334. He further states that there

is double jeopardy caused to the Petitioner and that aspect had not been

considered by the Learned High Court Judge when delivering the order.

Learned President Counsel further states that,

1. The Attorney General had failed to furnish a duly issued warrant for the

arrest of the Respondent. The document purported to be the warrant

for the arrest does not contain all material particulars as required in

terms of Section. 8 (2) (a) of the Extradition Law No. 8 of 1977 as

amended by Act No. 48 of 1999.

2. Pecuniary penalty imposed of the Respondent - Petitioner.

The learned President's Counsel submits that the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of the Colombo is not a legal order, and it

cannot be maintained.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Respondent

informs Court that the Learned High Court Judge had very clearly

considered all aspects before delivering the order in accordence with

the Sri Lankan Law considering the Provisions of the Extradition Law of

Act No.8 of 1977 amended by Act No: 48 of 1999.

Learned High Court Judge was not called upon to check the

validity of the procedure in Australia, of a date (at page 61). when

considering the affidavit as at page 14 by investigating officers. date of

warrant is stated as 24/12/2009 (as at page 15)

The Learned High Court Judge has thereafter. acted under

Provisions of Sections 10(4) of the Extradition Law No. of 8/1977 and

followed the correct procedure.

Considering the above facts this Court is of the view that the date

of warrant is given as 24/12/2009 as at page 15 according to the

affidavit of the investigating officer.

Australian Government has taken action under civil procedure

and recovered the damage caused to this complainant. Since the

Petitioner has not been charged twice by the Australian Government

and had only recovered sum of money after following the correct

procedure. no double jeopardy caused to the petitioner. Therefore.

Learned High Court Judge has very correctly followed the Provisions of

Sections 8 and 10 of the Extradition Law No. of 8/1977 amended by Act

No: 48/1999. Therefore, the Learned President's Counsel has not

established a prima facia case in order to serve notice to Respondents to

re - visit the above mentioned order and, there is no basis to issue notice

to the respondent. Accordingly, this Revision Application is hereby

dismissed without costs.
