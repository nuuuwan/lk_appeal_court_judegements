Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the Circular annexed to the petition marked P8

by which the 1st Respondent, the Secretary, Ministry of Environment has vested

residue forests in the 7th Respondent, the Conservator General of Forests;

b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 7th Respondent and those acting under him

from interfering with the issuance of a mining license to the Petitioner.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner states that a Mining License to operate a quarry is issued by the 10th

Respondent, the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau on the recommendation of the

Divisional Secretary of the area within which the quarry is situated. The Petitioner

has stated further that in addition to the said recommendation, an applicant must

obtain an Environmental Protection License issued by the Central Environmental

Authority and a Trade License issued by the Pradeshiya Sabha of the relevant area in

order to obtain the license from the 10th Respondent. An applicant is thereafter

required to obtain an Explosive License from the District Secretary of that area. A

pre-condition to obtaining any of the said licenses however is the recommendation

of the Divisional Secretary.

The Petitioner states that he made an application in early 1997 to the 6th

Respondent, the Divisional Secretary, Irakkamam seeking the recommendation of

the 6th Respondent to carry out mining of metal on a State Land. The Petitioner

claims that the 6th Respondent, having carried out an investigation of the site and

having been satisfied of the suitability of the land to carry out a quarry, had

recommended the issuance of a mining license. The 10th Respondent had thereafter

issued the Petitioner a mining license in July 1997 valid for a period of one year. The

said license had been renewed annually until 29th December 2011. The Petitioner

states further that he operated the quarry during this period, after having obtained

all other regulatory approvals.

4

In early December 2011, the Petitioner had made an application to the 6th

Respondent, seeking his recommendation to renew the mining license for a further

period of one year. The 6th Respondent had however refused to act on the said

application and had informed the Petitioner that the relevant State land has been

vested in the Department of Forest Conservation and that the 6th Respondent no

longer has the jurisdiction to recommend his application. The 6th Respondent had

accordingly advised the Petitioner to submit his application to the Department of

Forest Conservation.

The Petitioner had thereafter made inquiries with regard to the change of procedure

and found that the 1st Respondent, the then Secretary, Ministry of Forests and

Environment had issued Circular No. 5/2001 dated 10th August 2001, annexed to the

petition marked P8, which reads as follows:

The said Circular had subsequently been amended by Circular No. 2/2006 dated 17th

May 2006, annexed to the petition marked P10.

The Petitioners complaint to this Court is twofold. The first is that the 1st

Respondent, by virtue of being the Secretary of the Ministry under which the

Department of Forest Conservation has been placed, does not have the power to

issue the Circular P8. The second is that the land on which the quarry is situated is

not within a Reserve Forest and therefore the 7th Respondent cannot exercise any

jurisdiction over the said land.

The Forest Ordinance introduced in 1907 is the cornerstone of the present law

relating to forests. The Ordinance was substantially amended by the Forest

(Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009, which re-named the Ordinance as the Forest

Conservation Ordinance. The long title of the Act specifies that it is a law relating to

the conservation, protection and sustainable management of the forest resources

and utilisation of forest produce.

Section 78 of the Act defines a Forest to mean all land at the disposal of the State.

The phrase, all land at the disposal of the State has been defined in Section 78 of

the Act to include the following:

(a) all forest, waste, chena, uncultivated, or unoccupied land, unless proof is

adduced to the satisfaction of the Court that some person:

(i) has acquired, by some lawful means, a valid title thereto, or

6

(ii) has acquired a right thereto as against the State by the issue to him

of any certificate of no claim by the State under the State Lands

Encroachments Ordinance or the Definition of Boundaries Ordinance,

or

(iii) is entitled to possess the same under a written grant or lease made

by or on behalf of the British, Dutch, or Sri Lankan Governments, and

duly registered in accordance with law.

(b) all lands resumed by the State under the provisions of the Land

Resumption Ordinance, and all lands which have been declared to be the

property of the State by any order passed under "The Waste Lands

Ordinances, 1897 to 1903", the Land Settlement Ordinance, or to which

the State is otherwise lawfully entitled;

Thus, any land which does not fall within (i) - (iii) above, would be forest land.

The Petitioner does not dispute the fact that the land on which the quarry is situated

is State land. Applying the above definition, the land on which the quarry is situated

would therefore fall under the definition of a forest.

Section 3 of the Act contains provision to declare as a Reserve Forest the lands that

are referred to in that section. Section 3A empowers the Minister to declare any

specified area of State land or the whole or any specified part of any Reserve Forest

as a Conservation Forest. Furthermore, the Minister may, in terms of Section 12 of

the Act, by Order published in the Gazette, constitute any portion of forest a village

forest for the benefit of any village community or group of village communities. The

learned Senior State Counsel has stated that any other forest land, which has not

been declared either as a Reserve Forest, Conservation Forest or a Village Forest is

referred to as residue State forests. The fact that there can be forest land other

than the three categories referred to above is recognized by the amendment made

to Section 20 of the Act by the Forest (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009.1

1 In terms of Section 20(1)(d) of the Act, quarrying stone within a residue forest land is an offence punishable by imprisonment or fine or both.

7

The learned Senior State Counsel has submitted that irrespective of the classification,

the control, management and regulation of forest land as defined in Section 78 is

with the Conservator of Forests. He submitted that while the power to manage

forests is with the Department of Forest Conservation, the Act contained provisions

which empowered the Divisional Secretaries to take steps to safeguard forest land.

The learned Senior State Counsel submitted further that the administrative power to

manage residue forest land had been vested in Divisional Secretaries by a circular

issued in 1998 and that all what the Circular P8 has done was to cancel that circular

and re-vest all residue forest land in the Conservator General of Forests.

In support of his submission, the learned Senior State Counsel drew the attention of

this Court to two Circulars. The first is Circular No. 49 dated 16th January 1980, titled,

jk iusm;a md,kh lsrSu issued by the Secretary, Ministry of Lands and Land

Development. By this Circular, which has been annexed to the Statement of

Objections marked R2, the power to regulate the felling of trees was vested with

the State Timber Corporation.

The second is Circular No. 5/98 dated 1st July 1998, marked R3, issued by the

Secretary, Ministry of Forests and Environment. The learned Senior State Counsel

submitted that the power to administer residue forest land had been conferred on

Divisional Secretaries by R3, as borne out by the following portions of R3 which

reads as follows:

It was the submission of the learned Senior State Counsel that a decision was taken

to re-vest in the Department of Forest Conservation all such forest land over which

the Divisional Secretaries had been conferred power in terms of R3. That is a policy

decision that the Government is entitled to arrive at, taking into consideration inter

alia its policy objectives and the development needs of the Country at any given

time. The policy that prevailed in 1998 is reflected by R3 while the change in policy

is reflected in the Circular P8.

The learned Senior State Counsel drew the attention of this Court to the judgment of

the Supreme Court in Ranjanee Pathirana vs Secretary, Ministry of Environment

and Natural Resources and Others.2 In that case, the appellant was occupying a

forest land on an annual permit issued by the Divisional Secretary. After hearing all

parties, the Court of Appeal had issued a Writ of Mandamus directing the Secretary,

Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources and the Conservator of Forest to

take appropriate steps to protect the forest described in the permit issued to the

appellant. On appeal, the Supreme Court held as follows:

All natural forests are vested with the Department of Forest Conservation. The

forests which are not controlled by the Department of Wildlife and Department

of Forest Conservation were vested with the Divisional Secretaries. However,

with the introduction of Circular No. 5/2001 the aforementioned Government

forests which were earlier vested with the Divisional Secretaries had been

vested with the Department of Forest Conservation on 10th August 2001. .... The

Conservator of Forests has a legal duty and authority to protect the forest. In

the field of public law the writ of mandamus is a powerful weapon the Courts

use freely to prevent breach of duty and injustice. When mismanagement is

obvious it is the duty of Court to be vigilant and remedy the situation.

2 SC Appeal No. 78/2006; SC Minutes of 5th March 2000.

9

Taking into consideration the totality of the above, and especially the judgment of

the Supreme Court, this Court is in agreement with the submission of the learned

Senior State Counsel that all what P8 has done is to restore in the Conservator

General of Forests, the administrative power to manage residue forest land which

had been given to Divisional Secretaries by R3. This Court is therefore of the view

that the provisions of Circular P8 are neither arbitrary nor ultra vires the powers of

the 1st Respondent, who is the Secretary of the Ministry entrusted with the subject of

forests,3 and that the 7th Respondent can exercise powers conferred on him by the

Act over all forest land. The necessity to consider the prayer for the Writ of

Prohibition therefore does not arise.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to grant the relief

prayed for by the Petitioner. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
