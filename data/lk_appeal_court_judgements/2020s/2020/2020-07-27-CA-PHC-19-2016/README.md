A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) invoked

the jurisdiction of this Court to set aside the order dated 03/02/20 I 6, delivered by

the learned Provincial High Court Judge of Kandy dismissing an application to

issue a writ in the nature of Certiorari to quash the decision of transfer of the

Appellant, to the post of Deputy Principal by the I st Respondent-Respondent,

pending disciplinary inquiry as reflected in the impugned document marked

"PI I ".

According to the Petition filed in the Provincial High Court, the impugned

decision was challenged on the following grounds.

I. failure to issue a formal charge sheet

2. denial of right to challenge the said charge sheet before a competent

authority.

3. denial of right to challenge the findings by a competent authority in appeal.

4. demotion in service pending inquiry.

As reflected in paragraph 9:6 of the written submissions filed of record, it is

the position of the Appellant that there was no charge sheet issued against the

Appellant at the time the original application was made to the Provincial High

Court. It is also submitted that according to the documents tendered by the

Respondent, it is evident that the Appellants statement was recorded after the

charge sheet was issued.

State Counsel for the Respondents contends that senous financial

irregularities had taken place during the Appellants tenure as principal of

Gangasiripura Kanishta Vidyalaya and a preliminary inquiry, concluded, that the

Appellant was guilty as charged and ordered a sum of Rupees 316,719.87 to be

recovered. Thereafter, pending a formal inquiry, the Appellant was transferred to

Nillamba Maha Vidyalaya by the impugned letter marked "PI!,'. The learned

Counsel further submits that the said investigation was carried out in tenns of

Financial Regulation 104 and that the exigencies authorized the transfer of the

officer in tenns of Section 24(4) of the Establishment Code. It is also submitted

that the said transfer could not be considered as a demotion, since the Appellant

was transferred from a Grade II school to a Grade IC school, which is located

higher in the hierarchy of schools.

The Appellant invoked jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court when the

said transfer was effected as reflected in the impugned letter, pending fonnal

Inquiry.

When this matter was taken up for argument the learned Counsel for the

Appellant contended that, at present, the fonnal inquiry proceedings instituted

against the Appellant is concluded and the matter is now pending in appeal before

the Provincial Public Services Commission.

In the circumstances, the only question before this Court for detennination

is whether the transfer of the Appellant pending fonnal inquiry is justified.

The grievance of the Appellant is that the transfer from a Grade II school to

a Grade IC school is not justified and amounts to a demotion in service. It is

Page 4 of 5

observed that the Petitioner has complied with the transfer order and assumed

duties in the school transferred to since 2016. Clause 24(4) of the Establishment

Code mandates such transfer pending formal inquiry.

There is a real possibility of impeaching credibility of due process when an

officer is permitted to remain in an institution where his conduct is investigated.

Clause 24(4) prevents such situation by authorizing the transfer of such officer

pending inquiry. The State Counsel in the course of his submission has drawn

attention of Court to pages 148 and 149 of the brief to substantiate his stand that

the transfer pending formal inquiry cannot be considered as a demotion in service

as contemplated by the Appellant as for reasons aforesaid. The learned Counsel

for the Appellant has not placed any material before Court to contradict this

position.

In the circumstances, we do not see any illegality or breach of duty on the

part of the Respondents to justity the issuance of a writ of Certiorari to quash the

impugned decision.

Accordingly, the judgment of the Provincial High Court Judge is affirmed.

Application dismissed. We make no order as to costs.

Dr. Ruwan Fernando, J.

I agree.
