Before: Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Ghazzali Hussain for the Petitioners

Dr. Charuka Ekanayake, State Counsel for the Respondents Written Tendered on behalf of the Petitioners on 26th March 2019 Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Respondents on 27th May 2019 Decided on: 25th September 2020

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for argument on 16th July 2020, all learned Counsel

moved that judgment be delivered on the written submissions that have already

been tendered on behalf of the parties.

The question that arises for the determination of this Court is whether the Order

made under Section 38(a) of the Land Acquisition Act No. 9 of 1950, as amended (the

Act) vesting the land that is the subject matter of this application with the State,

should be revoked, or whether the State should divest itself of the said land.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioners claim that the original owner of an allotment of land called

Kandalwatta Owita situated in the District of Galle was their father, Abdul Hameed

Mohommed Hussain. The Petitioners state that in March 1984, their father had

gifted the said property to his wife (the mother of the Petitioners) and his three

daughters (i.e. the Petitioners) by Deed of Gift No. 4718. The Petitioners state that

their mother gifted her share to them by Deed of Gift No. 602 executed on 5th March

2009, and that the said land is now co-owned by the Petitioners. The Petitioners

state further that they have built houses on the said land and are living on the said

property. I must note at this stage that the Respondents have disputed the title of

the Petitioners to the said land, claiming that the Petitioners father had illegally

possessed the said land, and that the first Deed of Gift does not even bear a

3

reference to its previous registration. The Respondents have also stated that the said

Deed of Gift has been executed by A.H.M.Hussain eight years after the publication of

the Section 2 notice, which is a contravention of the provisions of Section 4A of the

Act.

The Petitioners admit that the State had initiated acquisition proceedings under the

Act in respect of the said land for the purposes of a playground for the Nawinna

Muslim Kanishta Vidyalaya which is situated on the opposite side of the road leading

to the land in question. The Petitioners claim that even though the said land was

acquired, the said school does have a playground, and hence there is no necessity to

have another playground.

The Respondents state that the request for the acquisition of the said land was made

in 1976, and that the notice under Section 2(1) of the Act, marked 2R1a was issued

on 18th November 1976. The notice in terms of Section 4(1) of the Act, marked 2R2

had been issued on 4th April 1977. It is important to note that the Petitioners do not

claim that their father objected to the proposed acquisition, as provided for by

Section 4(4). The declaration under Section 5(1) of the Act that the said land is

needed for a public purpose and will be acquired under the Act, marked 2R3 had

been published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 205/3 dated 10th August 1982. In terms

of Section 5(2), a declaration made under Section 5(1) shall be conclusive evidence

that the land is required for a public purpose.

The Respondents state that pursuant to the publication of the notice under Section

7, an inquiry was held in terms of Section 9. By letter dated 28th September 1984

marked 2R4, the Petitioners father had been requested to be present at the said

inquiry together with the documents to establish his title to the said land. The

Respondents however state that A.H.M. Hussain did not present any documents, and

that even though by letter dated 12th December 1984, he informed the then

Government Agent that the relevant documents would be submitted, he failed to do

so.

The Acquiring Officer had accordingly referred the matter to the District Court of

Galle in terms of Section 10(1) of the Act, and deposited a sum of Rs. 108,000 being

the compensation payable for the said land in terms of the valuation of the

4

Department of Valuation vide 2R7. The award of the Acquiring Officer in terms of

Section 17 had thereafter been published in July 1988. I have examined the said

award, marked 2R8, and the report of the Acquiring Officer marked 2R9 and

observe that the monies have in fact been deposited in the District Court, Galle.

The Order made by the Minister of Lands under Section 38(a), published in

Extraordinary Gazette No. 556/07 dated 3rd May 1989 directing that possession of

the said land be taken over on behalf of the State had only been issued after the

Respondents went through the procedure set out in the Act for the acquisition of

land. I must state that the 1st Respondent has not made an order in terms of proviso

(a) of Section 38, as alleged by the Petitioners.

The Respondents have brought to the attention of this Court that A.H.M. Hussain

challenged the Order under Section 38(a) in CA (Writ) Application No. 745/89, but

that the said application had been dismissed by this Court on 12th December 1995

due to the failure on the part of A.H.M.Hussain to exercise due diligence in pursuing

the said application. This was done after his Counsel informed this Court that he does

not have instructions from the Petitioners father.1 The fact that their father

instituted Writ application No. 745/89 has not been divulged to this Court by the

Petitioners, with the explanation for the said non-disclosure being that they were not

aware of such a case having been filed by their father.

The acquisition proceedings having been completed, the only thing left to be done

was to take over actual possession of the land on behalf of the State, and thereby

bring the process that started in 1976 to a closure. However, that was not to be.

The following matters relating to the handing over of possession are admitted by the

parties:

(a) Possession of the said land has not been handed over by the Petitioners to the

Acquiring Officer in spite of the Order under Section 38(a) being published in

May 1989;2

1 The petition in the said case has been marked 2R10 while the journal entry of 12th December 1995 has been marked 2R11. 2 Vide paragraph 12 of the petition (amended petition filed on 9th October 2012).

5

(b) The Petitioners were requested by the 2nd Respondent, the Divisional Secretary

to hand over the said land as far back as in 1994;3

(c) Proceedings have been instituted in the Magistrates Court of Galle as far back

as in 2003, in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of

1979, as amended, to evict the Petitioners from the said land;4

(d) After several abortive attempts, the learned Magistrate had issued an order to

evict the Petitioners in July 2011;

(e) The application of the Petitioners to set aside the said Order has been rejected

by the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province holden at Galle;5

(f) The Petitioners have refused to yield possession of the land, in spite of the

Fiscal seeking to implement the Order of the Magistrates Court in August

2011;6

(g) The Petitioners have resisted the attempt by the Fiscal to implement the Order

of the Magistrates Court;7

(h) This application was filed in September 2012 after the Petitioners were

informed by the 3rd Respondent that he is taking steps to move the Magistrates

Court to evict the Petitioners;8

(i) The Petitioners continued to occupy the said land in view of the ex-parte stay

order issued by this Court on 10th October 2012.

Thus, the Respondents were unable to utilise the land as a playground for the School

not due to any fault, lapse or negligence on the part of the Respondents, but due to

the conduct of the Petitioners.

The issue that gave rise to this application commences with the following letter

dated 24th July 2012 marked P27, sent by the 1st Respondent, Minister of Lands to

the Minister of Education:

The Petitioners state that as the 1st Respondent has recommended the divestiture of

the said land by P27, they too wrote to the 1st Respondent the following letter

dated 20th August 2012, marked P28:

Having sent P28, the Petitioners invoked the jurisdiction of this Court soon

thereafter, seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to divest the

7

land in terms of Section 39A of the Act, or in the alternative to act in terms of Section

39 of the Act and revoke the vesting order made under Section 38(a).

In terms of Section 39A(1) of the Act, Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order

under section 38 (hereafter in this section referred to as a "vesting Order") any land

has vested absolutely in the State and actual possession of such land has been taken

for or on behalf of the State under the provisions of paragraph (a) of section 40, the

Minister may, subject to subsection (2), by subsequent Order published in the Gazette

(hereafter in this section referred to as a "divesting order") divest the State of the

land so vested by the aforesaid vesting Order.

While Section 39A(2) contains four conditions that must be satisfied prior to an order

for divestiture being made in terms of Section 39A(1), the condition precedent to an

Order under Section 39A(1) is that actual possession of such land should have been

taken for or on behalf of the State. It is not disputed that even though the State has

tried several times over the years to take possession of the said land, it has not been

successful due to stiff resistance from the Petitioners. In these circumstances, as the

Petitioners are still in possession of the land, the necessity for me to consider the

prayer for a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to act in terms of

Section 39A(1) does not arise.

I must however state that there are conflicting judgments of the Supreme Court

whether a Writ of Mandamus would lie even if the conditions set out in Section

39A(2) have been satisfied. In Urban Development Authority v Alexander Pintuge

Abeyratne and Others, Chief Justice Sarath Silva, having considered the judgment in

De Silva v Atukorale, Minister of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development

and another,9 took the view that a former landowner does not have a legal right to

seek a divesting and that as the Minister has a discretion whether to act in terms of

Section 39A, Mandamus does not lie. The necessity for me to enter that debate in

this application does not arise, in view of the fact that actual possession of the land

has not been taken over by the State.

As actual possession of the said land is still with the Petitioners, the first question

that I must consider is whether the Petitioners are entitled to seek a revocation of 9 [1993] 1 Sri LR 283.

8

the vesting order. The necessity for me to consider whether the Petitioners have a

legal right to seek a Writ of Mandamus directing the Minister to act in terms of

Section 39(1) of the Act would arise only if I answer the first question in favour of the

Petitioners.

The starting point of this discussion would naturally be Section 39(1) of the Act,

which reads as follows:

Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under section 38 (hereinafter in this

section referred to as a "vesting order") any land has vested absolutely in the

State, the Minister may, if possession of the land has not actually been taken for

and on behalf of the State in pursuance of that Order, by subsequent Order

published in the Gazette revoke the vesting order.

Except for the requirement that the State should not have taken over actual

possession of the land, Section 39(1) does not set out the criteria that must be

satisfied for an Order to be made under the said Section, nor does the said Section

set out the circumstances in which the Minister must act in terms of Section 39(1).

I shall now consider several cases which have laid down the test that should be

applied by the Minister when determining whether a vesting order must be revoked.

In Silva vs Minister of Lands and Others,10 this Court held as follows:

The question that arises is, in these circumstances is it justifiable for the

respondents to have this land without any plan to utilize the same for any public

purpose. It appears that the purpose for which the said land was acquired by

the 3rd respondent is now evaporated. The 3rd respondent has not shown to

Court that they have any public purpose for which this land could be utilized. As

the possession of the said land has not been taken over and the public purpose

for which the said land was acquired is not in existence, the Minister of land has

authority under section 39(1) of the Land Acquisition Act by order published in

the gazette to revoke the vesting order of the said land made under section

38 of the Act.

10 [2008] 1 Sri LR 188.

9

When the public purpose is not in existence and the authority which had sought

the acquisition has no other identified public purpose for which it could be used

it is the duty of the Minister to revoke the vesting order if the possession of the

land has not been taken over by the State.

In Gnanawathie Ranasinghe and Another v Minister of Lands and Others,11 the

Supreme Court, referring to Section 39(1) of the Act stated that:

The governing part of the above section, in my view, is the following phrase: if

possession of the land has not actually been taken for and on behalf of the State

in pursuance of that order. In my view if the possession of the land has not

been taken for and on behalf of the State, the Minister has the power to make

an order under Section 39(1) of the Act.

The above is a reflection of the position laid down by the Supreme Court in De Silva v

Atukorale, Minister of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development and

another,12 where Mark Fernando, J held as follows:

"The purpose of the Land Acquisition Act was to enable the State to take

private land, in the exercise of its right of eminent domain, to be used for a

public purpose, for the common good; not to enable the State or State

functionaries to take over private land for personal benefit or private

revenge. Where the element of public benefit faded away at some stage of the

acquisition proceedings, the policy of the Act was that the proceedings should

terminate and the title of the former owner restored; hence, Section 39 and

Section 50.13

Thus, whether the Minister is under a duty to act in terms of Section 39(1) is

dependent on the all important question, is the land still required for a public

purpose? In other words, does the State still require the land for a public purpose? If

it is, the Minister has no duty to act in terms of Section 39(1). If the land is no longer

11 SC Appeal No. 87A/06; SC Minutes of 13th September 2017. 12 Supra. 13 In terms of Section 50(1), The proceedings commenced under this Act for the acquisition of any land or servitude may, at any time before an Order under section 38 in respect of that land or servitude is published in the Gazette, be abandoned.

10

required, I am of the view that the Minister may act in terms of Section 39(1), even

though a vesting order made under Section 38(a) has the effect of conferring

ownership of the said land in the State. It would perhaps be important to bear in

mind that the public purpose for which the land was initially required may have

changed but as long as there exists a public purpose for which the land is required, I

am of the view that the Minister is not under a public duty to act in terms of Section

39(1). This position is succinctly set out in the following paragraph of De Silva v

Atukorale:

Of course, even in such a case it would be legitimate for the Minister to

decline to divest if there is some good reason - for instance, that there is

now a new public purpose for which the land is required. In such a case it

would be unreasonable to divest the land, and then to proceed to acquire it

again for such new supervening public purpose. Such a public purpose must

be a real and present purpose, not a fancied purpose or one which may

become a reality only in the distant future.

Whether a land owner has a legal right to compel the Minister to make an Order in

terms of Section 39(1) where the land is no longer required for a public purpose had

been considered by this Court in Kingsley Fernando v Dayaratne and Another.14 In

that case, Sarath Silva, J (as he then was) having considered whether a Writ of

Mandamus would lie where a divestiture is sought in terms of Section 39A, held as

follows:

The procedure of such acquisition commences upon a decision made by the

Minister, in terms of section 2(1) that land in any area is needed for a public

purpose. The decision gets narrowed down to a particular land or a particular

servitude, when the Minister makes a direction to the acquiring officer in terms

of section 4(1). Thereafter, the Act provides for the various stages in the

acquisition of the particular land or servitude. A person having an interest in the

land or the servitude to be acquired, is provided an opportunity in terms of

section 4(4) of the Act to object to such acquisition. After a firm decision is made

by the Minister in respect of the acquisition by a declaration under section 5(1),

a person having such an interest has a right to make a claim for compensation

14 [1991] 2 Sri LR 129.

11

in terms of section 7(2)(c). The succeeding provisions of the Act afford an

opportunity to such person to vindicate his claim for compensation and, to title

where there is a dispute.

Section 50(1) provides for the abandonment of the acquisition proceedings at

any time before a vesting order is made under section 38. Section 39(1) provides

for the revocation of a vesting order under section 38, which may be made only

if the possession of the land has not actually been taken for or on behalf of the

State. As noted above, section 39A introduced by the amendment applies in a

situation where the possession of the land has also been taken. These sections

that deal with abandonment, revocation and divesting, stand out from the

general procedure as contained in the Act. In my view these sections constitute

a different class of power vested in the Minister, to be exercised only if it is

considered that the land is no longer required for a public purpose. They

provide for a reversal of the acquisition that commences upon a decision of the

Minister made in terms of section 2(1) that land or a servitude is needed for a

public purpose, at different stages of the process. It would therefore be totally

inconsistent with the statutory scheme to contend that any of these provisions,

section 50(1), 39(1) or 39A afford a statutory right to a person interested in the

land to demand the exercise of such power by the Minister. As noted above, the

right of a person interested in the land or the servitude to be acquired, to object

to such acquisition and to claim compensation, is specifically provided for.

Therefore such a person could have no statutory right to demand a reversal of

the acquisition process by invoking any of the provisions set out in section 50(1),

39(1) or 39A. I am also of the view that the underlying basis of the exercise of

the powers vested in the Minister by this group of sections is a situation where

the land is no longer required for a public purpose. (emphasis added)

In my view, the last sentence sets out the precise legal position that a Court must

address when called upon to consider whether the Minister may act in terms of

Section 39(1). Where the acquisition of a land is sought for a public purpose, and

even though a vesting order has been made under Section 38, where the possession

remains with the original landowner, he does not have a right to seek a revocation of

the Order as long as the said public purpose or any other public purpose as explained

in De Silva v Athukorale remains.

12

I shall now consider the position of the Respondents on whether the said land is

required for a public purpose.

Even though the 1st Respondent has written P27, in his affidavit tendered to this

Court, the 1st Respondent has stated as follows:

a) By P27, I have merely sought confirmation from the Minister of Education

whether the said land should be divested solely based on representations made

to me.

b) P27 does not contain any decision to divest the said land.

c) I have not come to a finding and/or decision to divest the land and I have now

been informed that since this land is needed urgently for the development of the

Nawinna Muslim Vidyalaya, vacant possession of the land is essential.

The Respondents have produced several documents marked 3R1 3R4 issued

during the period 2008 2010 by the School Development Society and the Nawinna

Mosque urging the Respondents to expedite the taking over of the land for the

school, as the land is required for the School.

Having considered the above explanation of the Respondents in the context of P27,

and the fact that the said land could not be utilised for the intended public purpose:

(a) Due to the refusal by the Petitioners to hand over the property;

(b) Due to the resistance on the part of the Petitioners to yield possession in spite

of orders of the Magistrates Court;

(c) Not due to the fault, lapse or negligence of the Respondents,

I am satisfied that P27 has been written by the 1st Respondent without having a

proper knowledge of the ground situation, namely that the public purpose was not

implemented not due to the fact that the land was no longer required for the said

13

public purpose, but due to the conduct of the Petitioners. Hence, I am inclined to

accept the explanation offered by the 1st Respondent in his affidavit.

Thus, I accept the position of the Respondents that the land is still required for the

public purpose for which the land was initially acquired. I am therefore of the view

that:

(a) The factual situation that must exist for an Order to be made under Section

39(1) does not exist in this application;

(b) The necessity for me to consider whether the Petitioners have a legal right to

seek a Writ of Mandamus therefore does not arise.

In the above circumstances, I see no legal basis to grant the relief prayed for by the

Petitioners. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
