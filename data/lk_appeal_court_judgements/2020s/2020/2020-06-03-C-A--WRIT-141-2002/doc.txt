Janak De Silva J.

In 1979 and 1985 the State consequent to orders made under and in terms of section 38(a) of

the Land Acquisition Act as amended (Land Acquisition Act) (P1 and P2) acquired the lands

forming the subject matter of this application for a the public purpose, namely setting up a

housing scheme of 1,000,000 housing units for low income families in the Wellawatte area in

Colombo.

Page 6 of 11

The Petitioners claim that possession of these lands were taken over by the State and

thereafter the National Housing Development Authority converted the public purpose from

setting up of a housing scheme of 1,000,000 housing units for low income families to proViding

them with loan facilities to build their own houses on the said lands.

The 11th and 11A Added Respondents challenged the change of public purpose which was

dismissed by this Court on the basis that the State was entitled to change the public purpose for

which the land was originally acquired [Noor Zareena and Another v. National Housing

Development Authority and Others (CA 346/1991, C.A.M. 01.04.1996)]. The special leave to

appeal application was refused [Noor Zoreena ond Another n. National Housing Development

Authority and Others (S.c. Spl. L.A. 225/96, 06.09.1996)].

Thereafter the Petitioners had come into possession of the lands in issue and taken loan

facilities and made developments to their respective properties.

Subsequently orders had been made under and in terms of section 39A of the Land Acquisition

Act divesting portions of the lands acquired by the State in terms of P1 and P2 (P5 and P6). The

Petitioners are assailing these two orders on the basis that the requirements needed for

divesting to be made in terms of section 39A of the Land Acquisition Act has not been fulfilled.

It is further submitted that piece meal divesting is not possible [Kingsley Fernando v. Dayaratne

and Others (1991) 2 Sri.L.R. 129; Mendis v. Jayaratne, Mininster of Agriculture, Lands and

Forestry (1997) 2 Sri.L.R. 215].

When this application was supported for notice, a stay order was issued in terms of prayer (c)

to the petition which reads:

"staying the Respondents from taking any consequential steps in terms of order

published under section 39A of the Act to divest the said lands"

During the pendency of this application admittedly the following orders had been made:

(1) Gazette Notification No. 1327/14 dated 12/02/2004 marked X5 which cancelled the

divesting order of the land described in Gazette No. 1185/14 (P5).

Page 7 of 11

(2) Gazette Notification No. 1752/9 dated 01/04/2012 marked as X6. This cancelled the

acquisition made in terms of Pl.

Thereafter, the status of the lands forming the subject matter of this application as at present is

as follows:

A portion of the land acquired by P1(X1) was divested by P5(X3) which divesting order was

cancelled by X5. Hence the land forming the subject matter of P5(X3) continues to vest in the

State.

A portion of land acquired by P2(X2) was divested by P6(X4) and later the acquisition of the said

land was cancelled by X6. Hence this land is not vested in the State.

In both these situations, the relief claimed by the Petitioners becomes futile. In the first

instance there is nothing to quash as the land continues to vest in the State. In the second

instance there is no question of quashing the divesting as the land is now not vested in the

State.

During the course of the argument, Court gave anxious consideration to the orders X5 and X6

having being made during the pendency of the interim relief issued in this case and requested

parties to address Court on the status of those two orders.

However, as the learned SDSG correctly submitted the order marked X5 which cancels the

divesting order of the land described in Gazette No. 1185/14 (P5) is in favour of and associate

with the relief prayed for by the Petitioners.

He further submitted that the order marked as X6 which cancels the acquisition made in terms

of P1 falls outside the scope of the interim relief granted by Court. Having giving careful

consideration to the scope of the interim relief granted by Court, we are inclined to agree with

this submission.

Page 8 of 11

However, the making of the order marked as X6 has effectively deprived the Petitioners from

obtaining a determination from Court on the question of divesting for the land forming the

subject matter of that order. Yet, it is a matter that the Petitioners were aware as far back as

04.06.2013 (in view of motion bearing the same date) but did not take any steps either by way

of seeking to amend the petition and praying for relief against the order marked X6 or filing a

fresh application to challenge it.

In this context, two principles must be borne in mind.

Firstly, in Weerasooriya v. The Chairman, National Housing Development Authority and Others

[CA. Application No. 866/98, C.A.M. 08.03.2004] Sripavan J. (as he was then) held that the

Court will not set aside a document unless it is specifically pleaded and identified in express

language in the prayer to the petition. The Petitioners have failed to pray for any relief against

X6.

Secondly, in the absence of a quashing of X6 by a Court, it continues to be valid. Clive Lewis,

Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th Ed., South Asia Edition (2017) in discussing the meaning of

null ond void in Administrative Law states (page 185):

"The primary concern here is the meaning of nullity or voidness solely in the context of

the remedies granted by courts. The concept of nullity has been used to solve other

problem arising in administrative law. For remedial purposes, the orthodox view is that

an ultra vires act is regarded as void and a nUllity. An act by a public authority which

lacks legal authority is regarded as incapable of producing legal effects. Once its

illegality is established, and if the courts are prepared to grant a remedy, the act will

be regarded as void from its inception and retrospectively nullified in the sense that it

will be regarded as ever incapable of ever producing legal effects." (Emphasis added)

Page 9 of 11

Thus, even where an act of a public authority is ultra vires and a nullity, for remedial purposes

the illegality must be established before a court. As stated by Wade and Forsyth, Administrative

Law, 9th Ed., Indian Edition, 281:

"".the court will treat an administrative act or order invalid only if the right remedy is

sought by the right person in the right proceedings"

This approach is reflected in the statement of Lord Radcliffe in Smith v. East Elloe Rural District

Council [(1956) A.C. 736, 769-770] where he held:

"An order, even if not made in good faith is still an act capable of legal consequences. It

bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead. Unless the necessary proceedings are

taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise

upset, it will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of

orders."

Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law, (supra) page 304, after restating the above statement

of Lord Radcliffe sets out the correct position as follows:

"This must be equally true even where the 'brand of invalidity' is plainly visible for there

also the order can effectively be resisted in law only by obtaining the decision of the

court. The necessity of recourse to the court has been pointed out repeatedly in the

House of Lords and Privy Council, without distinction between patent and latent

defects. Lord Diplock spoke still more clearly [F Hoffmann-La Roch and C AG v. Secretary

for Trade and Industry (1975) A.C. 295 at 366], saying that

It leads to confusion to use such terms as 'Voidable', 'voidable ab initio', 'void' or

'a nullity' as descriptive of the status of subordinate legislation alleged to be

ultra vires for patent or for latent defects, before its validity has been

pronounced on by a court of competent jurisdiction." (Emphasis added)

Page 10 of 11

" .

This approach is consistent with the 'presumption of validity' according to which administrative

action is presumed to be valid unless or until it is set aside by a Court [F Hoffmann-La Roche and

Co. AG v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) A.C. 295]. However, this 'presumption

of validity' exists pending a final decision by the Court [Lord Hoffmann in R v. Wicks (1998) A.C.

92 at 115, Lords Irvine LC and 5teyn in Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 A.C. 143

at 156 and 161, and 173-4].

This presumption applies to subordinate legislation, such as X6, as well. It is in this context that

Lord Irvine LC in Boddington v. British Transport Police [(1999) 2 A.C. 143] held:

"The Anisminic decision established, contrary to previous thinking that there might be

error of law within jurisdiction, that there was a single category of errors of law, all of

which rendered decision ultra vires. No distinction is to be drawn between a patent (or

substantive) error of law or a latent (procedural) error of law. An ultra vires act or

subordinate legislation is unlawful simpliciter and, if the presumption in favour of its

legality is overcome by a litigant before a court of competent jurisdiction, is of no legal

effect whatsoever."

For all the foregoing reasons, the application of the Petitioners is dismissed without costs.
