Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners filed this application against the Urban

Development Authority (UDA) seeking to quash by a writ of

certiorari the Quit Notice marked P1 issued by the Director

General of the UDA in terms of section 3 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act.

By this Quit Notice, the UDA seeks to eject the 1st Petitioner

from Lots 1 and 14 of Plan No.5534 marked R2.

The pivotal argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioners is that the State has no title to the said two lots to

summarily eject the Petitioners therefrom by utilising the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The UDA relies on the Grant dated 11.10.1985 marked R1,

issued under the Crown Lands Ordinance, to claim title to the

land.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners, citing Silva v.

Bastian (1912) 15 NLR 132 where it was held A Crown grant by

itself creates no presumption of the title of the Crown to the land

which it conveys, submits that a Grant itself is not conclusive

proof of ownership.

Learned Presidents Counsel, tracing the history of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act and submitting that the

legislative ancestor of the present Act is the old Forest

Ordinance enacted in 1907, also formulates the argument based

on the Full Bench decision of the Supreme Court in Weerakoon

v. Ranhamy (1921) 23 NLR 33 that the impugned Quit Notice is

4

contrary to the objective sought to be achieved by the Act and

therefore ultra vires.

I think, I need not, in this case, embark upon consideration of

the validity of these two important legal arguments advanced by

learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners, in his ingenuity,

as this case can be conveniently disposed of purely on the

merits.

After the Grant had been issued in favour of the UDA, the UDA

was not in possession of this land for even a single day. This is

acknowledged by the officer of the UDA who gave evidence at the

inquiry before the acquiring officer into payment of

compensation for the portions of lands acquired under the Land

Acquisition Act for the road widening.1

Let me briefly outline what this compensation inquiry was all

about. The Road Development Authority wanted to acquire

some portions of lands for the widening of the road named Dr.

N.M. Perera Mawatha in Rajagiriya. There is no complaint that

the proper procedure was not followed in the acquisition of lands

for this purpose.

According to the Gazette marked P5, Lot 89 of Plan No.8703

marked R23 was also acquired for this purpose. The Assessment

Number of the said Lot 89, as per the Gazette, is 1177. The said

Gazette further discloses that both the State and a person by the

1 Vide page 91 of X, which is a copy of the case record in the District Court Case No.32/DLA/09, tendered with the counter objections of the Petitioners.

name of Wilson Perera claimed the land as owners. Wilson

Perera is a predecessor in title of the Petitioners.2

As seen from the plaint in Case No.32/DLA/09 filed by the

acquiring officer as the Plaintiff, at the inquiry before the

acquiring officer into payment of compensation for the said Lot

89 of Plan No.8703, four claimants had come forward to claim

compensation on the basis of ownership of the said lot.3 Those

four claimants were made Defendants in the said District Court

case. One of the claimants, the 1st Defendant in the District

Court case, was the UDA. The 2nd Defendant was a third party.

The 3rd and 4th Defendants were the predecessors in title of the

Petitioners.4

At the inquiry before the District Court, several witnesses gave

evidence and a large number of documents were tendered. The

predecessors in title of the Petitioners tendered voluminous

documentary evidence to show their long-continued possession.

If I may refer to one of them, the Electoral Register for the year

1969 shows that Wilson Perera was in possession of the said lot

even in 1969.5

The UDA tendered to the District Court inter alia the Grant and

the Plan No.5534 to establish its title.6

In the answer filed in the District Court, the UDA took up the

position that Lot 89 of Plan No.8703 is a part of Lot 1 in Plan

No.5534.7

However, in the written submissions tendered before the District

Court, the UDA took up the position that the said Lot 89 of Plan

No.8703 is a part of Lot 14 of Plan No.5534.8

The officer of the UDA who gave evidence before the District

Court stated that Lot 89 of Plan No.8703 falls into Lot 14 of Plan

No.5534, and Lots 1 and 14 in Plan No.5534 are contiguous

lots.9 It is the same officer who gave evidence before the

acquiring officer as well.10

This goes to show that parts of Lots 1 and/or 14 in Plan

No.5534 were the subject matter of the said District Court case.

It may be recalled that (a) the lands described in the Quit Notice

P1 is also Lots 1 and 14 of Plan No.5534, and (b) the UDA

claimed compensation on the basis of ownership of those two

lots relying on the Grant R1.

What was the Judgment of the District Court? The District

Court by the Judgment dated 07.02.2018 decided that the 3rd

and 4th Defendants and their predecessors in title are entitled to

Lot 89 of Plan No.8703 by Deeds as well as prescription. The

claim of the UDA was refused, and compensation for the

7 Vide paragraph 6(a) of the answer at page 63 of X. 8 Vide inter alia paragraphs 27, 28, 31 at pages 275-276 of X. 9 Vide pages 175-176 of X. 10 Vide page 91-92 of X.

7

acquisition was ordered to be paid to the 3rd and 4th Defendants

who are the predecessors in title of the Petitioners.11

The UDA did not appeal against this Judgment. Instead, what

did the UDA do? The UDA made use of the provisions of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act to send the impugned

Quit Notice. When was this Quit Notice signed? After the

inquiry in the District Court case but before the Judgment was

delivered. The long drawn out inquiry in the District Court case

was concluded on 25.04.2017.12 The Quit Notice is dated

28.12.2017. The District Court Judgment was delivered on

07.02.2018.

Upon receipt of the Quit Notice, the Petitioners came before this

Court on 19.02.2018 challenging the same.

The UDA, in paragraph 25(e) of the statement of objections

dated 19.07.2018, takes up the position that Since the title of

the lot 89 of the Preliminary Plan No.8703 was in dispute, the

same was referred to the District Court by the RDA under the

provisions of section 10(1) of the Land Acquisition Act and the

said action is still pending in the District Court, which is the

competent Court to decide the title of a land.

However, when the UDA filed this statement of objections, it

knew or ought to have known that the District Court, which the

UDA says is the competent Court to decide the title of the land,

held against the UDA and in favour of the predecessors in title of

the 1st Petitioner.

11 Vide, in particular, pages 265-266 of X. 12 Vide page 258 of X.

8

In my view, the 2nd Respondent, the Director General of the

UDA, abused the provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act in order to eject the 1st Petitioner from the land

in suit summarily. He cannot do so. The very fact that the Quit

Notice was issued after the inquiry but before the delivery of the

Judgment of the District Court amply demonstrates mala fides

on the part of the UDA. The summary procedure of ejection laid

down in the Act cannot be allowed to be abused to achieve

ulterior motives. That is not the intention of the legislature. I

quash the Quit Notice P1 by certiorari.

I grant the reliefs to the Petitioners as prayed for in paragraphs

(b) and (e) of the prayer to the petition.

The application of the Petitioners is allowed with costs.
