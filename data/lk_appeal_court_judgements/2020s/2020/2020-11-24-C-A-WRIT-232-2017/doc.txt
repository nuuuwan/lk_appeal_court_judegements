The above styled Writ Application was filed by the Petitioner, namely, Sri Lanka Transport

Board, seeking the main substantive relief, viz., a Writ of Certiorari to quash the Order of the

1st and 2nd Respondents dated 26-04-2017 marked as P4.

The 3rd respondent was an employee of the Petitioner Board from 03/06/1977 and retired

from service on 10th July 2010 on reaching the age of retirement. Thereafter his service was

extended by one year. He was employed from 11 July 2010 to 10th July 2015 on a contract

basis. The 3rd respondent made a complaint dated 8 September 2015 to the Asst.

Commissioner of Labour at the District Labour Office at Kalutara and claimed that the 3rd

respondent be declared entitled to:

i. The benefits of continuous unbroken service from 3rd June 1977 to 10th July 2015.

ii. Order the payment of annual increments from 2010 and the increased wages due

under the budget proposals from 2013. (Vide complaint marked P1)

The 3rd respondent further claimed by letter dated 8 January 2015 (marked P1(1)) that

he be declared entitled to:

iii. Gratuity for the whole period.

iv. EPF payment for the period from 11th July 2010 to 10th July 2015.

The petitioner submitted their response to the complaint, to the Asst. Commissioner of

Labour by letter marked P2 and indicated that:

v. It is not possible to pay salary increments for the period during which the 3rd

respondent was employed on a contract basis.

vi. It is not possible to treat the period of service on contract basis as a continuous

period of service.

Page 2 of7

vii. It is possible to pay the EPF payments due for the period payable by the Petitioner

Board.

viii. It is possible to pay gratuity for the whole period from 3,d June 1977 to 10' July

2015.

The Petitioner Board has explained in their statement marked P3, that according to

Human Resources Circular No. 15 of 2011 of the Petitioner Board, based on Public

Enterprises Circular No. 60, the age of optional retirement for employees of the Board on

1st May 2011 or after will be 55 years and the period of service on extension of service

will be upto 57 years. As the 3,d respondent was not in service as on 1st May 2011 he will

not be entitled to claim benefits under Public Enterprises Circular No. 60.

After the conclusion of the inquiry held by the 1st respondent, the 2nd respondent by his

order dated 26th April 2017 (marked P4) has held:

ix. The 2nd respondent has decided that it is proper to allow the claim of the 3"

respondent and

x. Further has ordered that the petitioner comply with the directions given under

items 1 to 5 of the order and report to the 1st respondent within 14 days. (Vide

paras P4(a) and P4(b) of P4)

The Petitioner disputes the said order and states that it was

I. Made by the 2nd respondent whereas the inquiry was held by the

1st respondent.

II. On the face of the order, It is not based on a consideration of the

rights of parties and not based on material placed before the 1"

respondent at the inquiry.

III. Made without conSidering the main issues at the inquiry, that is,

whether the 3rd respondent is legally entitled to his claim and the

relevance of Public Enterprises Circular No. 60 in respect of the 3rd

respondent.

Page 3 of 7

The Petitioner therefore states that the 2nd respondent has failed to consider the fact that

the 3,d respondent has reached the age of 55 years and retired from service before 1st May

2011 and hence has no right to claim an extension of service. The Petitioner further states

that the 2nd respondent has also failed to consider that after l1th July 2011 the 3rd

respondent has worked on a contract basis and that his contract was being extended from

time to time by periods of 6 months and 12 months.

The Petitioner states that the Petitioner by letter marked P13 inquired from the department

of Public Enterprises whether this circular applies to a person who is serving on a contractual

basis and has being advised in the letter marked P14 that, if a person is serving on a contract

basis the person is bound by the terms of the contract. Further the 2nd respondent has failed

to consider that under Section 44B(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act, a suit for the recovery of

any sum due under the Industrial Disputes Act from any employer to any workman shall be

maintainable if it is instituted within two years after the sum is due.

The Petitioner also states that the claim of the 3rd respondent is prescribed under Section

44B(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act. Therefore, the Petitioner embarks on the concept that

the order marked P4 is ultra vires, unreasonable and made in violation of the rules of natural

justice. Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner preferred this writ application to the

Court of Appeal to quash it.

In response to the aforesaid submissions of the Plaintiff, the 3,d Respondent states that

according to the letter of the Chief Human Resources Manager of the Board dated 11.12.2015,

marked P2, in the computation of gratuity due to the 3rd Respondent the entire period of his

service from 03.06.1977 to 10.07.2015 has been considered continuous and without break in

service.

Therefore, the 3,d Respondent states that the 2nd Respondent, Deputy Commissioner of

Labour, has made the order dated 26.04.2017 marked "P4", after considering properly all

documentary evidence produced by the parties in the inquiry. Therefore, it is not arbitrary,

unreasonable or perverse. Accordingly, the 3,d Respondent states that the order sought to

be quashed is entitled to stand undisturbed and therefore, this application may be dismissed

with cost.

The 1" and 2nd Respondents submit that the 3rd Respondent was an Employee of the

Petitioner and was recruited as Security Guard on 03-06-1977. (vide: Xl) The 3rd Respondent

reached the age of retirement of 55 years on 10-07-2011 and was retired from service by

letter marked as X2. Thereafter, the 3rd Respondent was given a one-year service extension

by the Petitioner, with effect from 11-07-2010 to 10-07-2011. (X3). During the aforesaid

extended service period of the 3rd Respondent, the Public Enterprise (PE) Circular No: 60 was

issued and came into operation with effect from 01-05-2011. This PE Circular No 60 made 55

years as the optional age of retirement and 60 years as the mandatory age of retirement and

also entitled an employee to continue in service without applying for service extension

beyond the optional age of retirement of 55 years till 57 years. The 1" and 2nd Respondents

also submit that this PE Circular No 60 should be applicable to the 3rd Respondent as at the

point of time this Circular came into operation on 01-05-2011, the 3rd Respondent was

serving an extension of service beyond the optional age of retirement of 55 years and had not

reached 57 yea rs of age.

Subsequent to a thorough analysis of the facts of the case, it is pertinent to note that the

Petitioner by letter dated 18-09-2012, (X6) had informed the 3rd Respondent that he had

been retired from service upon completion of 55 years on 10-07-2010 and taking into account

the exigency of service he was placed on contract basis in service from 11-07-2010 till 10-01-

2013. It was also mentioned in said letter marked as X6 that the said extended service period

shall be considered as a service period without a break in service. Thereafter from 10-11-

2013 onwards aforesaid contractual period was extended from time to time until the 3rd

Respondent reached the mandatory age of retirement of 60 years (vide: P7, P8 P9 P10 P11

and P12)

I further note that the above-mentioned letters of extension of service marked as X6 of P1,

P7, P8 and P9 were submitted to be clearly in contravention of the provisions of the PE

Circular No 60 (lR1). While the 3rd Respondent was serving his contractually extended service

period, in the year 2013, another Public Enterprise Circular No 01/2013 was issued . This PE

Circular No 01/2013 entitled an Employee to serve till the mandatory age of retirement of 60

years without applying for any extension of service upon reaching the optional age of

retirement of 55 years. The aforesaid PE Circular No 01/2013 was adopted by the Petitioner

Page 5 of7

on 12-03-2015 by Sri Lanka Transport Board Circular No 01/2015 which came into effect on

12-03-2015. (vide: XI0)

It is also important to note that at this point of time when the aforesaid PE Circular No

01/2013 was adopted by the Sri Lankan Transport Board Circul,ar No 01/2015, the 3rd

Respondent had not reached the mandatory age of retirement of 60 years and was serving

an extended service period without a break in service on a contract. (vide PI2). Item 04 in

the aforesaid Sri Lanka Transport Board Circular No 01/2015 which further buttresses the

position maintained by the Respondents that this Circular No 01/2015 ( i.e. PE Circular No

01/2013) too should be applicable to the 3rd Respondent . The said item 4 ofTransport Board

Circular No 01/2015 states as follows :

"<ytl)2S) ~ 6,';" D",,,,6 DeJ~c'iil"'D "Dtl)~2SlD v(9' ",,,-{En 25)~D2S) ~!Sl,,,-{~,zsf

As such, by the application of the said PE Circular No: 01/2013, I believe that the 3rd

Respondent was entitled to continue in service without any extensions of services until his

mandatory age of retirement of 60 years.

Since the Petitioner itself had admitted by X6 that the said extended contractual period was

given to the 3rd Respondent without a break in service, such extensions should be regarded

as the active service period of the 3rd Respondent at the Sri Lanka Transport Board from the

date of his appointment on 03-06-1977 for purposes of computation of Gratuity and other

statutory dues as well as for salary increments (if any). The decision of the 1st and 2 nd

Respondent as reflected in P4 was based on the above-mentioned findings and therefore

could be considered as a valid and lawful decision.

In the aforesaid premises, I believe that the Petitioner's application is misconceived in law

and should therefore, be dismissed.

This petition is dismissed with cost.
