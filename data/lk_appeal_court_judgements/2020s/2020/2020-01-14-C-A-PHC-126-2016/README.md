HON. JUSTICE K.K. WICKREMASINGHE

Accused-Petitioner-Appellant is present on bail.

Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the Appellant makes submissions

to mitigate the sentence. He informs Court that the Appellant was

convicted for an offence punishable under Section 78 (5) read with

Section 9 of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (As

Amended) for possession of 530 mg of cannabis sativa. After pleading

guilty to the charge, he was convicted and accordingly, imposed to pay a

fine ofRs.I500/- and enlarged the Accused-Petitioner-Appellant on bail.

Since he is a young person, learned Counsel for the Appellant makes

submissions to bring down the sentence and to convert the fine to a State

cost. Further, it is submitted that Rs.I500/- already paid by the

Appellant as a fine .

State Counsel appearing for the Respondent, considering the above

circumstances concedes to the application by the Counsel for the

Appellant to convert the fine to a State cost.

Accordingly, we act under Section 306 (1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.I5 of 1979 (As Amended). Considering the Appellant's

age, good behaviour and the other extenuating circumstances (the

documents filed as 'Xl' - 'X51 we set aside the conviction and the fine.

Acting in terms of Section 306 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No.I5 of 1979 (As Amended), without proceeding to the conviction, we

warn and discharge the Accused-Petitioner-Appellant. Also, we order the

Appellant to pay Rs.I500/- as a State cost. Since he had already paid
