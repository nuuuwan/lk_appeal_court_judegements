ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Petitioners are the joint liquidators of Bonaventure Apparels

Lanka (Private) Ltd., (hereinafter referred to as the "Company"),

appointed by the District Court of Negombo in case No. 2425/SPL, after it

had decided to liquidate the said Company under the provisions of the

Companies Act No. 17 of 1982, on 23.07.2001. (hereinafter referred to as the

said" Act"). They also functioned as liquidators of Bontex Lanka (Private)

Ltd., appointed by the said Court, after it had decided to liquidate the said

Company in case No. 2424/SPL on 14.05.1999 on the application of Messrs

Kay Jay Agencies Limited.

It is stated by the Petitioners that they have been discharging their

duties duly as the Liquidators of the said two Companies and have

2

submitted the accounts of the receipts and payments in relation to the said

two Companies to the 1st Respondent, as required by Section 296 of the

said Act, who accepted the same" wi thou t any demu r" .

The Petitioners claim that they became aware that the said two

Companies had been included in the list published on 05.05.2009 in the

"Daily News" newspaper by the 1st Respondent in terms of Section 487(3)

of the Companies Act No.7 of 2007 as Companies that are liable to be

struck off, in terms of the said Section upon their failure to apply for re-

registration.

In challenging the legality of the said "decision" of the 1st

Respondent to include the said two Companies in the list of Companies,

which are liable to be struck off, the Petitioners, by their applications in

WRT 357/2010 and WRT 358/2010, have sought Writs of Certiorari in

quashing the inclusion of the names of Bonaventure Apparels Lanka (Pvt.)

Limited and Bontex Lanka (Private) Ltd., in the list of Companies that are

liable to be struck off, ,in terms of Section 487(3) for their failure to apply

for re-registration.

At the hearing of the two applications, the parties agreed that a

common judgment could be pronounced by Court on them since both

these applications (WRT 357/2010 and 358/2010) were in fact based on an

identical legal issue concerning the inclusion of their names in the list of

Companies that are liable to be struck off.

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners contends that

Section 487(2) of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 required all "existing

Companies" to apply for re-registration and for the assignment of a new

3

Company number within 12 months coming into operation of the said Act

of No. 7 of 2007. If a Company failed to make such an application, the 1st

Respondent, after having caused to publish the name of such Company in

a daily newspaper, would strike its name off from the register maintained

by him. Learned President's Counsel made reference to Section 529 of the

said Act where the word Company is defined as "a Company incorporated

under this Act or an existing Company" and since the District Court had

already made order that the two Companies are liquidated, they could not

be considered as existing Companies.

Therefore, the Petitioners claim that both these Companies, having

ceased all operations pursuant to the winding up order made by the

District Court of Negombo, were already under liquidation, and therefore

could not be considered as "existing Companies" within the meaning of

Section 487(2) of the Companies Act No.7 of 2007 since the affairs of the

said Companies are completely wound up, the Court shall, upon an

application made by the Petitioners, would have to make an order that the

Companies be dissolved, which is in terms of Section 395 of the Companies

Act, similar in effect to the striking off the name of the Company from the

register in terms of Section 487 of the Companies Act.

In invoking the jurisdiction conferred under Article 140 of the

Constitution by the two applications, the Petitioners seek the issuance of

Writs of Certiorari in quashing the "decision" to include the names of

Bonaventure Apparels Lanka (Pvt.) Ltd. and Bontex Lanka (Private) Ltd.,

in the list of Companies that are liable to be struck off from the register

maintained by the 1st Respondent under Section 473. They also seek

issuance of a Writs of Prohibition, in restraining the 1st Respondent from 4

striking off the names of Bonaventure Apparels (Pvt.) Ltd. and Bontex

Lanka (private) Ltd. from the said register maintained by the 1st

Respondent. They claim that the decision of the 1st Respondent to include

the Company in the list of Companies liable to be struck off in terms of

Section 487(3) for failure to apply for re-registration (tendered and marked

as P4) is therefore" arbitrary, unlawful, illegal, unreasonable, irrational, ultra

vires of the powers of the 1 5/ Respondent, not a bona fide exercise of the statutory

powers" vested in him and therefore ex facie null and void.

In resisting the Petitioner's application, the 1st Respondent states in

his objections that the Company is an "existing company" within the

meaning of the relevant provisions of the Companies Act No. 7 of 2007 and

there are consequences which follows upon noncompliance of the

statutory provisions contained in Section 487 of the Companies Act No.7

of 2007 by operation of law, which automatically triggers upon the failure

to apply for re-registration leaving no discretion with him.

At the inquiry into the application of the Petitioners held by this

Court on 09.12.2019, learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners

contended that at the time the District Court made order that the two

Companies had been wound up, Section 487(4) of the Companies Act No.

17 of 1982, which contained the applicable law at that point of time, had no

specific provisions recognising the status of the Petitioners as liquidators

of the Company as the persons who could apply to the 1st Respondent to

have a new numbers assigned to the two Companies.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in her reply contended that the

process sought to be quashed by the Petitioners is clearly an automatic

5

process, which is set out in motion by operation of law, leaving no

discretion on the part of the 1st Respondent and due to that reason, the

impugned act of inclusion of the names in the list published is not

amenable to Writ jurisdiction. She also stressed that the 1st Respondent had

only made a publication and not made a determination and on that

ground too no Writ lies.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General was of the vIew that the

Petitioners could have acted under the provisions of Section 487(5) of the

Companies Act, within a period of six months since the publication, as the

wording of the Section indicates inclusion of liquidators.

In view of the submissions of the parties, it appears that one of the

core issues that had to be determined is whether the two Companies could

be considered as "existing Companies" in respect of Section 487(2) of the

Companies Act or not. Its relevant to note that both Act No.17of 1982

and No.7 of 2007 had identical provisions on this issue.

It is undisputed that there is no application by either of the two

Companies for re-registration and the 1 st Respondent had included the two

Companies in the list of Companies that had been published in the

newspapers which are to be struck off from the list of Companies.

The District Court of Negombo made orders of liquidation and

appointed the Petitioners as liquidators in 1999 and 2000. The 1st

Respondent had published the names in newspapers on 05.05.2007. By

then, the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 had succeeded by the Companies

Act No.7 of 2007. It is the submission of the parties that the provisions of

Act No. 7 of 2007 that are applicable to the instant applications.

6

Section 487(2) of the Companies Act No 7 of 2007 states as follows;

"Within a period of twelve months from the coming into

operation of the Act all existing companies shall apply to the

Registrar to assign a new number as its company number, in

a form as may be prescribed by the Registrar. The new

number so assigned shall be entered in the register and also

on the fresh certificate of incorporation to be issued under the

provisions of subsection (6) of section 485."

Section 529 of the said Act where the word Company is defined as "a

Company incorporated under this Act or an existing Company" and if the two

Companies are not "existing Companies" as per the definition of the

Section, then these provisions have no application since they were not

incorporated under the Act No. 7 of 2007 but under the provisions of Act

No. 17 of 1982.

The two Companies that came into existence with its incorporation

under the Act No. 17 of 1982, were under compulsory liquidation when the

Act No.7 of 2007 was enacted. The question whether the two Companies

could be considered as "existing Companies" must be answered in the

light of the statutory provisions governing their dissolution.

Section 316(1) of the Act No.7 of 2007 states "where the affairs of a

Company have been completely wound up, the Court shall where the

liquidator makes an application on that behalf, make an order that the

Company be dissolved from the date of such order and the Company shall

be dissolved accordingly."

7

It is clear that the Petitioners have not made any applications to

Court that the affairs of the two Companies have been completely wound

up. The Court had not made orders that the two Companies be dissolved.

It has been said that "legal personality of the Company ceases to exist with

the making of the Order of dissolving the Company by Court", thus

marking the terminal point of existence the Company under compulsory

liquidation. Unless the affairs of the two Companies have been" completely

wound up" and the Court had made orders that the two Companies be

dissolved, it necessarily follows that the two Companies should therefore

be considered as" existing Companies" as far as the provisions of Section

478(2) is concerned.

It had been observed by the then Supreme Court in Hire Purchase

Company Ltd. & Another v Fernando 79 (II)NLR 15 that;

"As is well known a company comes into existence as a legal

personality on its incorporation and ceases to exist as such

on its dissolution. Winding up or liquidation is the process

whereby the management of the company's affairs is taken

out of its directors' hands. A liquidator is appointed to

administer the property of the company. He must apply the

assets to the payment of the creditors in their proper order.

The point to be remembered is that throughout this process of

winding up the company does not cease to exist as a legal

entity (vide the proviso to section 219 of the Companies

Ordinance). "

The conclusion reached by this Court on the status of the two

Companies that are under liquidation is not in conflict with the rest of the 8

provisions that govern the affairs of liquidators since Section 292(1)(b) of

Act No.7 of 2007, empowers the Petitioners "to carryon the business of the

company so far as may be necessary for the beneficial winding up of such

company" and Section 292(2)(b) states that the liquidator in a winding up

by the Court shall have power" to do all acts and to execute in the name and

on behalf of the company, all deeds, receipts and other documents and for that

purpose to use when necessary, the seal of the Company, ... ".

Therefore, the two Companies should have applied for re-

registration. Then the question arises whether the Petitioners could have

made the application for re-registration in view of the statutory provisions

of Section 487(4) of the Act No.7 of 2007.

Section 487(4) states that;

"During the period of six months referred to in sub section

(3), in addition to a director of the Company, shareholder of

such company or a person who has registered a charge under

section 102 or a person who has a money claim pending

before a Court or in arbitration proceedings, shall also be

entitled to apply to the Registrar to have a new number

assigned to such company under subsection (2)".

Learned President's Counsel contended that the Petitioners, being

the liquidators of the two Companies, were not recognised by the said sub

section by conferring them with an entitlement to apply to the Registrar of

Companies for re-registration. Learned DSG did not agree. She contends

that the words" in addition" and " also" in the said subs section denotes

that the list of the individuals that are stated therein are not exhaustive and

9

should be considered as similar to the usage of the word "inclusive of" in

statutes indicating the references are not exhaustive, and therefore the

Petitioners could have made applications for re- registration of the two

Companies, which they failed to.

With due respect to the learned DSG, this Court holds a different

view in relation to the usage of the words "in addition" and "also" in the

said sub section, which in its opinion could not be considered as a situation

similar to the one where the Legislature had indicated its intention by

using the words "inclusive of" in the enactment of the relevant statutory

provisions. The plain reading of the said subsection indicate that the words

"in addition" and "also" have been used to stress the limitation of the

scope of individuals who are recognised within the said sub section, a

position contrary to the one that had been advanced on behalf of the 1st

Respondent.

In these circumstances, and having considered the wording of the

said sub section, this Court is of the view, that there is merit in the

submissions of the learned President's Counsel and in fact it had been

joumalised that there is a proposal to amend Section 487 upon

recommendations of the Company Law Advisory Committee of the Law

Commission, which would have resolved the contentious issue. The two

matters were mentioned by the Court from November 2013 to June 2019 to

facilitate such a move but the issue could not unfortunately be resolved.

The role of a Court in this type of situation is aptly described in the

Supreme Court in its judgment of Sriyani Silva v Iddamalgoda, Officer-

in- Charge, Police Station Payagala (2003) 1 Sri L.R. 14, which had quoted

10

the judgments of Barru v Lachchman 111 PR 193 and Rananjaya Singh v

Bainath Singh & Others AIR 1954 SC 749, where it has been stated thus;

" ... if the result of giving effect to the plain meaning is

unfortunate, it is for the Legislature to take action to remedy

the defects of the law as enacted and it is not for the Courts

to usurp functions of the Legislature ... "

The other core issue that had been raised before this Court, in view

of the submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General is whether the

statutory provisions contained in Section 478(3) confers a discretion on the

1st Respondent in causing the publication of the names of the two

Companies in a daily newspaper or not.

Upon perusal of the wording of the Section 478(3), it is evident that it

deals with two situations. Firstly, it deals with the situation "where an

existing company fails to comply with the requirements imposed under

subsection (2) of this Section within the time specified therein, then the

Registrar shall cause to be published the name of such Company in a daily

newspaper in Sinhala, Tamil and English language, and ... ". Secondly the

said sub section also deals with a situation which had not arisen for

consideration as yet, as it states" ... where such company continues to fail

to comply with those requirements, thereafter, the Registrar shall, within

six months of the publication of its name in the newspapers, strike off the

name of such company from the register maintained by him under the

provisions of Section 473".

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in her submissions had

emphasised that the presence of the word "shall" in the said subsection left

11

no discretion on the 1st Respondent as it mandated that he "shall cause to

be published the name of such Company in a daily newspaper" if such

Company had failed to apply for re-registration. It seems that there is no

discretion conferred by the said subsection on the 1 st Respondent in respect

of a Company which had failed to make an application for re-registration

within the time specified in sub section 478(2).

It is stated by Jain and Jain, in their authoritative text on The

Principles of Administrative Law (1988) 4th Ed, at p. 325 that;

"Functions dischargeable by the administration may either

be ministerial or discretionanj. A ministerial function is one

where the relevan t law prescribes the du ty to be performed by

the concerned authority in certain and specific terms leaving

nothing to the discretion or judgment of the authority. it

does not involve investigation into disputed facts or making

of choices."

The impugned actions, upon which the Petitioners have sought

Writs of Certiorari, that the 1st Respondent's causing the publication of the

names of the two Companies in the daily newspapers, are clearly functions

mandated by law since there was no discretion was left on the 1st

Respondent, when a Company failed to apply for re-registration within

the stipulated period of time, not to publish the name of such a Company.

In the Privy Council judgment of Naakuda Ali v Jayaratne 51 NLR

457, Lord Radcliff has stated;

12

"". there is really no ground for holding that the Controller

is acting judicially or quasi judicially when he acts under

this regulation. If he is not under a duty so to act then it

would not be according to law that his decision should be

amenable to review and, if necessary, to avoidance by the

procedure of Certiorari."

This Court, in its judgment of General Secretary of the United

National Party v The Commissioner of Elections & Others (1998) 2 Sri L.R.

57 has stated its view on the availability of judicial review over the

functions of a public officers and the issuance of a Writ of Certiorari;

"It was argued that the functions of the elections officers are

purely ministerial and therefore not amenable to a Writ of

Certiorari. The law has developed since the decision in

Electricity Commissioners (1924) 1 KB 171. The Primary

purpose of Certiorari in modern administrative law is to

quash an ultra vires decision. That is, where a public body

acts in a way that is not permitted, or exceeds the powers

that the Courts recognize the body as possessing, whatever

the source of the power. The effect of Certiorari is to make it

clear that the statutory or other public powers have been

exercised unlawfully, and consequently to deprive the public

body's act of any legal basis. - Clive Lewis - Judicial

Remedies in Public Law, p. 145. When an order is quashed,

it is the legality of the order itself, and not the decision to

make it, with which the law is concerned. - Wade & Forsyth

- Administrative Law, 7th Ed. p. 634. The modern function

13

of Certiorari: is to provide an appropriate form of relief to a

successful applicant; the task of setting the boundary of the

Court's public law power of review is now determined by the

notion of the need for judicial supervision of public

functions. De Smith, Woolf and Jowell - Judicial Review of

Administrative Action, 5th Ed. p. 693."

In view of the above considerations, this Court is of the view that the

impugned act of the 1st Respondent, sought to be quashed by the issuance

of Writs of Certiorari is not tainted with any illegality that therefore not an

act that should be nullified by the issuance of a Writ of Certiorari. On that

account, issuance of Writ of Prohibition does not arise.

The applications of the Petitioners, namely Writ Application

Nos.WRT 357/2010 and WRT 358/2010 are accordingly refused. The two

petitions of the Petitioners in relation to the said two applications are

hereby dismissed.

Parties will bear their costs.
