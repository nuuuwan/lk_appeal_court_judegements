...

141 While praying for the dismissal of the Plaintitl's action on the basis that

no cause of action had accrued to the Plaintiff against the Defendants, the

Delendants sought a declaration of title to lot '13' and 'D' in Plan No. 25Ga

made by T. N. Cadar, Licensed Surveyor dated 15.05.1991.

Issues at the Trial

151 At the commencement of the trial on 02.04.1992, issues 1-7 were raised

on behalf of tile Plaintiff and issues H-16 were raised on behalf of the

Delendants. On 01.02.1993, the Counsel l()r tile Defendants moved to

wiLhdraw the Delendants' issues 14 and 15 on the basis til at they were not

relevant for tile determination of this action and thus, issue No. I G was

renumbered as issue No. 14. The case proceeded to trial on 14 issues.

IGI During the course of the evidence of the Plaintill on 04.01.1995, the

learned Counsel lor the Delendant~ raised two more issues and the said

issues were numbered as issues 15 and I () and hence, tile case further

proceeded to trial on 16 issues.

Trial

171 The Plaintilf testilied on her behalf and called Mr. M. B. Ranatunlfd,

Licensed Surveyor and D. P. Gunadasa who is her brother and closed the

Aluvihare, Licensed SUl\leyor in partition case bearing No. 8809 in the

Judgment

191 At the end of the trial, the learned Additional District./udge of Kelfdlle

by her judgment dated 18.01.1999 dismissed the PlaintilI's action for the

following reasons:

(i) W.M. Allis who was the 3'd Defendant in the partition action filed

in the District Court of Kegalle bearing No. 8890/P was only

entitled to lot :-3 in Plan No. 1176 and the Plaintiff by Deed No.

6521 marked P2 became entitled to the said lot 3 depicted in the

said Plan and accordingly, tlle Plaintiff is only entitled to lot 3 of

Plan No. 1176;

(ii) The Plaintill is only in possession of lot 2 of Plan No. K 2469

made by M.B. Ranatunga, Licensed Surveyor and there was no

proof of encroachment on tlle part of the Defendants onto lots 2

and 5 of Plan No. 1176 or ouster of the Plaintiff by the

De fendanl~ and tllere/ore, no cause of action had arisen alfdinst

the Defend;mts;

(iii) There was no credible proof that tlle Plaintiff and her

predecessors-in-title had acquired prescriptive title to lots 1 and :-3

depicted in Plan No. K 2469 made by M.B. Ranatunga, Licensed

Surveyor (lots 2 and .5 depicted in Plan No. 1176).

The Appeal

11 01 Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned Additional

DistrictJ udge of Kelfalle, the Plaintiff preferred this appeal to tllis Court.

This COUlt b judl,'11lent dated 06.12.2017 set aside tlle judgment of the

DC KEGALLE FINAL3819/L DCF - 0243-99

...

learned Additional DistrictJudge of Kegalle and allowed the Appeal. The

Defendants made an application for Special Leave to Appeal to the

Supreme Court ag-dinst the said judgment of the Court of Appeal and the

Supreme Court ha\~ng granted special leave to appeal, set aside the

judl-,'ment of the Court of Appeal dated 06.12.2017 and directed the Court

of Appeal to re-hear the case (Vide- order of the Supreme Court dated

09.0R.20IS).

Facts not in dispute

1111 It is not in dispute that there had been an earlier partition action in the

District Court of Keg-dlle bearing No. 8890 and the Final Decree in the

said partition action was entered IS.oa.1955. As per the Final Partition

Decree marked V:1 (i), lot 2 of Plan No. 1176 was allotted to Sethie, who

was the I" Defendant in the said partition action; (ii) lot 3 of Plan No. 1176

was allotted to Allis who was the 3'" Defendant in the said partition action

and the husband of the Plaintitl and (iii) lot 5 of Plan No. 1176 was allotted

to Sedera who was the Plaintiff in the said partition action.

1121 It is also not in dispute that:

I. Part of the land called 'Delgahamulahena' had already been

partitioned by the said partition action and Plan No. 1176 made by

.J. AlU\~hare, Licensed Surveyor was the Final Partition Plan of the

said action' ,

2. Lot I in Plan No. K 2469 corresponds with lot 2 in Plan No. 1176

and lot 3 in Plan No. K 2469 corresponds with lot 5 in Plan No.

1176;

3. Lot :1 in Plan No. 1176 is ollly a portion of lot 2 in Plan No. K 2469

and the said lot 3 corresponds with lot 'CI' in Plan No. 2563 made

DC KEGALLE FINAL 38 I 'lIL [KF - OH3-99

by T.N. Cadar, Licensed Surveyor and the balance portion of lot 2

or Plan No. K 2469 corresponds with lot 'F' of Plan No. 2563;

4. Lots I in Plan No. K 2469 corresponds with lot 'B' in Plan No.

2563, lot 3 in Plan No. K 2469 corresponds with lot 'B' in Plan No.

2563 and lot 2 in Plan No. K 2469 corresponds with lots 'CI' and

'E' in Plan No. 2563; and

5. The Plaintiff is in possession of the lot 2 of Plan No. K 2469, which

consists of lots 'CI' and 'E' in Plan No. 2563 made by T.N. Cadar,

Licensed Surveyor.

The Issues on Appeal

1131 When this matter was taken up for argument on 14.01.2020, both

Counsel made oral submissions in detail and filed further written

submissions. This Court is now called upon to decide the following issues

in this Appeal:

I. Whether the judgment of the learned Additional District .J udge is not

dated in violation or section 186 of the Civil Procedure Code?

2. Whether action presented by the Plaintiff constituted a rei vliJdicau'o

action proper or an action for ejectment of the Defendants or a

combination or a rei vliJdicatio action and a possessory action;

3. Whether the failure of the learned Additional DistricUudge to answer

the issue on misjoinder of parties in non-compliance of section 186 of

the Civil Procedure Code is a ground to set aside the judgement of the

learned Additional Dist:rictJudge;

4. If the action is a rei Vlildicatio action, whether the learned Additional

DistrictJ udge has erred in dismissing the action on the basis that the

Plaintiff has failed to prove title to lots I and 3 in Plan No. K 2469

made by M.B. Ranatunga, Licensed Surveyor;

1)(' KEGALLE FINAL 3819/L I)(,F - OH3-99

5. Whether the learned Additional District Judge was wrong in holding

that the Plaintitf has tailed to establish that the Defendant~ unlawfully

encroached onto lots I and 3 in Plan No. K 2469 and dispossessed her

Ii-om the said disputed portions of land;

6. Whether the learned Additional District Judge has erred in holding

that the Plaintiff had not proved that she had acquired prescriptive title

to lots I and 3 in Plan No. K 2469 by long, uninterrupted and

undisturbed possession for more than 10 years;

7. Whether the learned Additional District Judge has tailed to consider

that the Defendants had failed prove to the title to lot~ 2 and 5 in Plan

No. 1176 and adduce evidence that they occupy the disputed portions

of land as licensees; and

8. Whether the learned Additional District./udge was wrong in holding

tllat the I" and 2"" Defendant~ had acquired prescriptive title to lot~ I

and 3 of Plan No. K 2469 or lots '13' and 'D' of Plan No. 2563 by long,

uninterrupted and adverse possession ti)r more than 10 years;

Decision

Identity of the Subject Matter & Disputed Portions of Land

1141 The Plaintiff has instituted this action seeking a declaration of title to

the land called 'Delgahamulahena' morefully described in the schedule to

the Amended Plaint and the said land is depicted as lots 1,2 and 3 in Plan

No. K 2469 made by M. B. Hanatunga, Licensed Surveyor.

1151 It is not in dispute that the Plaintitf is in possession of lot 2 in Plan No.

K 2469 and the possession of the said lot 2 has not been disturbed by tile

Defendants. The Plaintiff is, however, seeking to eject the Defendants from

lots I and :-l in the said Plan No. K 2469 on tile basis tllat the Defendants

had encroached onto the said lot~ and dispossessed her Ii-om the said lots

IJC KEGALLE FINAL 3819/1. DCF - OH3-99

in the middle of 1986. Thus, the disputed portions of land in the present

case are only lots I and 3 in Plan No. K 2469 dated 28.11.1989 made by

M. B. Ranatunga, Licensed Surveyor.

Judgment to be dated in terms of Section 186 of the Civil Procedure Code

1161 Mr. Dharmadeva .Iayasinghe, the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff

submitted at the hearing that the judgment of the learned Additional

District./udge is not dated, which is a violation of section 186 of the Civil

Procedure Code. Section 186 of tlle Civil Procedure Code provides that

the judgment shall be in writing and shall be dated and signed by tlle.l udge

in open court at the time of pronouncing it. The learned Counsel for the

Plaintiff, however, conceded that the learned Additional District./udge of

Kegalle before whom tlle tTial was concluded had been transferred to the

District COUIt of Kuliyapitiya at the time of her writing the judgment and

tllat she had sent the jud!,'1l1ent to the District COUIt of Keg-<lIle to be

delivered by tlle District./ udge of Kegalle.

1171 It is not in dispute that the.l udicial Service Commission by letter dated

30.04.1998, had appointed tlle le<mled Judge to deliver tlle judgment

(Vide- pages 404- 405 of the brief) and thereafter, the judgment had been

sent to tlle District Court of Keg-aile together with the original case record

(Vide- journal entry No. 71 dated 08.10.1998). The journal entry No. 72

dated 18.01.1999 reveals tllat the judgment had been delivered in open

Court by tlle Dist:ricUudge of Keg-aile. It reads as follows:

in open Court on IS.O 1.1999 has not pr~iudiced the substantial right~ of

the PlaintilT or occasioned a lailure of justice.

The Nature and Character of the Plaintiffs Action

1211 At the hearing of this appeal, Mr . .Jayasinghe submitted that the action

tiled by the Plaintill was an action for the ejectment of the Defendants as

trespassers who encroached onto lots I and 3 in Plan K 2469 and

dispossessed the Plaintilr Ii'om the said portions of land. It was the

position of the DelendanL~ in the District Court (Vide- written submissions

tiled on behalf of the Detendants at page 260 of the brief) and in this

appeal (Vide- paragraph 4 of the written submissions liled on behalf of

the Delendants on 20.01.2014) that the action filed by the Plaintitr was a

rei vlildicaa'o action proper. The learned Counsel for the Defendant~ ,

however, submitted on 14.01.2020 that the Plaintil1' has disclosed two

dillerent causes of action and incorporated reliefs both in a rei I'lilr/icatio

action and a possessory action and thus, the Plaintitr has instituted this

action in violation of section a!i(l) of the Civil Procedure Code.

1221 The second issue lar consideration in this appeal is thus, whether the

present action tiled by the Plaintilr should be properly treated as a rei

VliJdiciJtio or an action for the ejectment of the Delendants. The related

issue is whether the Plaintilr has joined causes of action both in a rei

vli](/icatio and a possessOIy action.

1231 The curious feature of this action is that the Plaintitl is seeking a

declaration that she is the owner and possessor of the sub.ject matter of the

property, ~jectment of the Detendant> ,Uld damages. Any person who

wishes to recover possession of an immovable property has the choice of

the following main remedies for tJle recovery of such property and tJlese

in d1e Notice of Appeal that d1e judgment was read out by rl1e District

Court of Kegalle in open Court on 18.01.1999. (Vide- page I of d1e brief).

shall be reg-arded as rl1e date on which the judgment is delivered. It is d1e

duty or her successor to pronounce d1e judgment written by his

predecessor in open Court and insert the date of the judgment at the time

of pronouncing it. Any inadveltent omission on his part not to insert the

remedies are designed and brought for the same purpose of securing the

same primary relief of recovery of property.

1. He may proceed to recover property by rei vliJdicatio action on the

!,'Tound of his title to the property and prove his title as the owner,

independent of the right to possession;

2. He may proceed by action for declaration of title and ejectment

provided tllat he can prove tllat he enjoyed an earlier peaceful

possession and that subsequently he was ousted by the De!endant

giving rise to a rebuttable presumption of title in his favour where

dO/millLml (ownership) need not be proved strictly;

:l He may proceed by a possessory remedy and enforce himself to

proving his juristic possession viz, actual control over tile tiling

accompanied by the aminus dom;lIJJ; are fulfilled and take etlect.

1241 An owner can institute a rei vliJdicatio action to recover his property

from whoever is in possession without the owner's consent, irrespective of

whether possession is bona fide or mala tide (Wille's Principles of South

AIi'ican Law, 9th Ed. P. 5a9). According to Voet, 6.1.22, 6.1.20.24, 6.1.24,

6.1.2 and Wille's Principles of SOUtil Ali'ican Law, at page 539:

I)C KEGALLE FINAL 3819/L nct' - 0243-99

/25/ In the modern Roman Dutch Law, as applied in Sri Lanka and South

Afi-ica, two actions that are analogous to rei vindicatio are (i) the action for

declaration of title and (ii) tile action for ejectment. The action for

ejectment is often combined with the action for declaration of title. The rei

vliJdicatio action and the action Ie)!" declaration of title and ejectment are

both however, designed ami brought for the same purpose of securing the

same primary relief of recovery of property.

/261 However, tile action lor declaration of title and vindicatory action are

distinct in scope and tlle declaration of title and ejectment is not tlle same

as an action rei vliJdicalio (Le Mesurier v. Attorney-General (190 J) 5 NLR

65). In the said case, Lawrie,.J. at page 74 compared tlle lWO actions and

held that tlle action for the recovery of land in the possession of the Crown

corresponds to the prerog-dtive remedy of petition of rights addressed to

the King, praying the Court lor a declardtion of an asserted title to land, of

which the Crown is in possession. He stated tllat 'I do not call that an

action rei vlj7dicatio':

1271 The cause of action in rei vli)(hcatio action is, however, based on tile

sole h'Tound of the violation of the PlaintiWs rights of ownership, whereas

in tile action for declaration of title and ejectment, the cause of action is

based on tlle enjoyment of an earlier right of possession and subsequent

ouster giving rise to a presumption of title in favour of the Plaintiff.

1281 The dillerence between the requisite elements of the two actions WdS

considered in several decided cases. In tile case of Pathirana v. Jayasundara

(1955) 58 NLR 169, where the Plaintiff sued the Delendant for ejectment

of the Defendant on tile basis that tile Defendant was an over-holding

lessee by attornment and damages. Gratien.J. identified the oQject and

purpose of tile two actions and observed at page 173 that:

1301 In Dr. RasiahJeyar,~ah and Another v. Yogambihai Thambir~iah nee-

Renganathan Pillei, S.C. Appeal No. 146/2013 decided on 12.08.20 15, the

Defendant sued the overholding lessee for a declaration of title, ejectment

of tile Defendant and damages. It was the position of the Plaintiff that the

case is not a rei l7ildicatJo action, but an action based on pri\~ty of contract

as the Defendant was an over-holding lessee and thus, the Defendant is

estopped from denying tile Plaintitl's title to the premises.

1311 The District Judge granted relief as prayed for in the Plaint but tile

Civil Appellate High Court reversed the decision of the District Court on

the basis tllat (i) action was a rei VliJdicatJo merely because a declaration of

title was sought in limb I of tile prayer to the Plaint; (ii) there was not a

single issue raised rewarding title of tlle Plaintiffs; and (iii) title was not

proved and therefore the Plaintiffs were not entitled to the reliefs prayed

for and granted by the DistrictJ udge.

1321 Wanasundere./., held that every action where a declaration of title is

sought does not automatically become a rei vliJdicatJo action and that the

present action is not a rei Vli)(/icatJo action but it is an action based on

privity of contract. W,U1asundereJ", observed at page 6 that:

"In a rei vliJdicatJo actJon, ;J PlilIiltJlF CQmes to COUlt to get a

1331 A decree for a declaration of LiLle may, of course, be obtained by way

of an additional relief either in a l-e/~vlildi(duo action proper (which is in

Lruth an action liJ l-em) or in a lessor's action against his over holding Lenant

(which is an action IiI peJ:5on;un)- Patbirana v. Jayasundara (Supra, at 172).

BuL in the former case, the declaration is based on proof of ownership; in

the laLter, on proof of the COnLractual relationship which i()rbids a denial

LhaL the lessor is the true owner (Supra).

0(' KECALLE FINAL 3819/L DCI' - 01.t3-99

1341 This does not, however, mean that a lessor or landlord is conlined to

the contractual remedy against an over-holding lessee or tenant or that he

cannot sue IiI rem to vindicate his title and recover possession (Latheel' and

anotller v. Mansoor <Uld anotller (S.c. Appeal TO. 104/05 BALR 189, at

p. 196). All it means is til at if he chooses the rei vliJr/icatio remedy, he

cannot succeed just because the over-holding lessee or tenant fails to prove

his right to possess or simply rely on the rule of estoppel that a tenant

cannot contest tile title of his landlord, and must be able to establish his

title ag-ainst the whole world (.s'upra).

1351 The owner is not conlined to his remedy in contract and not bound to

proceed as if ag-ainst an overholding lessee where tile tie of landlord and

tenant has been severed and the lessee has lost his right of occupation and

tllere is no leg-al basis justifying tile tenant's continued occupation

(Senanayake v. Peter de Silva (19861 2 Sri L.R. 405). The actio rei

Vlildicatio is essentially an action Iii rem for the recovery of property on tile

proof of title and lor ~jectment of the person in wrongful occupation where

tile ownership of tile property is the very essence of tile action (Maasdorp's

Institutes (7th Ed.) Vol. 2, 96). On the contrary, an action for declaration

of title and ejectment is an action sought to enlorce a mere personal right

(Iii personam) ag-ainst a Defendant or Defendants, which can be lounded

on many special categories of circumstances.

1361 The classical Roman Law, distin/''l.Iishes between a proprietary right

(real) and a personal right lilter alia, on the object to which the right

pertains as explained by Groutius 2.1.58 as follows:

"Real lights are concemed pnin;lI1/y wldl dIe relationship between a

person and pmperly, whereas personal lights are concemed with dle

relationsl7li) between two peI:50ns. Thus, a real d7Jilg bJiu/5 iI

Pilrticular property, whereas a peI:5onal right blilds a particular

DC KEGALLE FINAL 381'1fL OCF - 02.t3-99

r

...

peHon. A real lighl estabiI~"hes a (iIic:ct 1c:lationsi7JiJ between a

person and a d7Jilg and empoweH dIe holder to control dIe d7Jilg

Wld7Jil the him's of tile n~hl wld10ut dIe co-operation of ;u1Odler

peHon. A peHonaJ light allords a claIin only agaIilst dIe particular

ol{ject of dIe light. At most, a personal light establil"hes only all

li](iIiect lelc7liollS/7JiJ wldl die d7Jilg IiI Ie.lpect of whicll a

peIiomlc7nce must be rendelc:d (VVJJfles PnilcliJles olSoudl Aliic<1n

Law, .9dl Ed. Atpc7ge 429).

1371 Thus, proprietary rights flow Ii-om juristic facts like transfer,

prescription, occupation and accession and are not established by mere

agreement between I:\\'o contracting parties (Willie's Principles of South

AIi-ican Law, Supra, p. 430). Thus, a proprietary right establishes a direct

relationship between the holder of the right and the property, whereas, a

personal right concerns the relationship between parties to a contract or

delict or any such oblig-dtion of personal nature.

1381 Those who are ill actual peaceful possession of property on such

obligations or other nexus between the person who is related to the

Plaintill will have all the rights, privileges, entitlements and powers that flow

[i-om the mere fact of a right of possession (ius possessiorns). However,

those who are in possession of a property on the basis of such oblig-dtion or

agreement will not make the action lei Vlildicatio, but would constitute an

action lor declaration of title and ejectment.

1391 The main distinction between the two types of actions appear to be

that in an action for declaration of title and ejectment, the Plaintiff need not

sue by right of ownership, but could do so by right of possession and

ouster and in such a case, the Plaintill's claim is a possessory remedy rather

DC KECALLE FINAL 3819/1, DCI' - 0243-99

than the vindication of ownership (W. A. Cyril v. H. SU/idthadasa, C.A.

857/ 1999 decided on 06.10.201 I).

1401 An action for declaration of title and ~jectment can fall into many

forms and situations as described, depending on the following special

categories of relationships between the persons and property.

I. The action for declaration of title and ejectment can be founded

against a Defendant who enjoys possession of the subject matter

either on a privity of contract between the parties or otllerwise (e.g.

lessor and lessee or landlord and tenant or an overholding tenant or

lessee) on the basis of breach of contract-Pathirana v Jayasundara

and Benjamin Perera v. Gunawardena 1982 (I) S.L.R 214);

2. The action I()r decl,u'ation of title and ejectment GUl be founded

a/idinst a Defendant who enjoys possession of the subject matter by

any nexus between the person and property arising from ,Uly other

relationship or <UTangement or understanding of personal nature.

For example, in Nandasena WickraI11asekara Rajapaksha v.

Wanni<U'achchi K<Ulk<Ulamalage Temawatllie, S.C APPEAL No.

125/2010, decided on 17.12.2014, a nexus between the State and

the persons or his successors who occupied and possessed existed

as their lather was put into possession of the said land by the State

on the basis that he would be issued witll a permit in terms of the

Land Development Ordinance, although no permit was so far given,

but his successors qualified to be in occupation in telms of tlle

provisions of the said Ordinance.

3. The action for declaration of title <Uld ejectment can be founded

a/idinst a Defendant who eqjoys an earlier peaceful possession of the

subject matter but he was subsequently ousted by tlle Defendant. It

would i,';ve rise to a rebuttable presumption of title in favour of the

DC KEGALLE FINAL 38t9!L J)Cr. - OH399

r

-N

..

Plaintiff obviating tile need prove title strictly. Thus, depending of

ilie facts of ilie case, such an action can only be classified as an

action where dominium need not be proved strictly as ilie Plaintitrs

claim is only possessory remedy railier ilian ilie vindication of

ownership (Luwis Singho v. Ponnamperuma (Supra), Mudalihamy v.

Appuhamy (18910 CLRep. 67 and Adam Ibraim Rawter and

another v. A Ross (1880) 3 SCC 145);

(a) Type of Action Pleaded and Presented by fue Plaintiff

1411 The question wheilier ilie action is to be treated as a rei vindicatio or

declaration of title and ejectment or even possessory action depends on ilie

choice made by ilie Plaintiff in his pleadings, including ilie prayer to such

pleadings, which enables tile Court to understand ilie type of ilie action

presented by ilie Plaintiff.

1421 It is undisputed iliat ilie pleadings play an important role in identifying

ilie nature and character of ilie action presented by a party to ilie Court.

Section 40 (2) (d) of lie Civil Procedure Code provides iliat ilie Plaint shall

contain a plain and concise statement of the circumstances constituting

each cause of action, and where and when it arose. Thus, ilie Plaintiff must

choose ilie nature and character of ilie action to be presented to the court

and such choice shall be exercised by clearly setting out ilie cause of action

upon which ilie case is founded.

1431 The Plaintiff must set out in his pleadings wiiliout any ambiguity as to

how his cause of action arises to sue the Defendant and recover possession-

whether to vindicate his title or enforce his rights on a privity of contract or

any legal obligation or nexus between the person and property or on the

basis of a possessory action. The pleadings shall also set out the reliel/s

DC KEGALLE FINAL 38 19/L DCI' - OH3-99

prayed for in such a way so as to enable the Court to grant anyone or

more of the reliefs provided in section 217 of the Civil Procedure Code.

1441 The determination of this question requires a careful examination of

the pleadings in the action and the prayers to such pleadings. The Plaintiff

has instituted this action seeking a declaration of title to the land morefully

described in the schedule to the Amended Plaint and ejectment of the

Defendants from the said property and damages. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the

Amended Plaint dated 31.1 O~ 1990 read as follows:

1471 The Plaintilf does not suggest in the Amended Plaint that this is a

declaratory action where there is a contractual obligation or any otller

nexus that exists or a possessory action where the proof of Litle is 110t

required. The present acLion of the Plaintilf, as has been presented is

purely based on the \~ndication of her title on the basis of the acquisition of

the said property 011 Title Deeds pleaded in para!,'Taph 2 of tile Amended

Plaint and thus, the present acLion is neither a declaratory action nor

possessory action.

14HI l [pon the reading of the PI'lintill's Pleadings and tile prayer to the

Amended Plaint, it seems to me that the Plaintiff has clearly set out in his

Pleadings without <my ambi!,ruity in such a manner to enable the court to

DC KF:GALLE FINAL 38 I 9/ L. OCF - 0243-99

understand the style and character of her action, which is one of rei

Vlildicatio proper. Furthermore, the manner in which the Plaintiff raised

issues (i.e. the Plaintiffs issue No.2) and presented the case in evidence

clearly indicates that the Plaintiff invited the District Court to hold that the

Plaintiff became the owner of the entirety of the property described in the

schedule to the Amended Plaint and depicted as lots I to 3 in Plan No. K

2469 on the basis that the Deed of Transfer No. 6521 dated 30.03.1962

and the Deed of Transfer No. 3633 dated 22.08.1958.

1491 The learned Counsel for the Defendants, however, submitted that the

Plaintiff has incorporated in the Amended Plaint different causes of action

that consists of the elements of both in a rei IlJjldicatio action and a

possessory action, in violation of section 35 (l) of the Civil Procedure

Code. In support of his contention, he drew our attention to paragraph 8

of the Amended Plaint and submitted that in addition to a declaration of

title, the Plaintiff has furtller prayed for a declaration of possession and

damages, which reliefs cannot be sought in one action in violation of

section 35 (1) of tile Civil Procedure Code. I shall now proceed to consider

the question whether the Plaintiff had incorporated reliefs bOtll in a rei

VlildJ'catio and a possessory action as submitted by the learned Counsel for

the Defendants.

1511 Section B5 (I) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

"In an action for the recovery of immovable property, or to obtain a

declaration of title to immovable property, no other claim, or any

cause of action, shall be made unless with the leave of the court,

except

a) claims in respect of mesne profits or arrears of rent in respect of

the property claimed;

b) damages for breach of any contract under which the property or

any part thereof is held; or consequential on tlle trespass which

constitutes the cause of action' and ,

c) claims by a mortg-agee to enforce any of his remedies under the

mortgage ... "

1521 In my view, the mere pleading possession does not automatically

convert a rei Vli](/icatio action into a possessory action and in support of

this view, I wish to reler to Maarsdorf (Volume 2. p. 27). Maarsdorf has

stated that the right~ of an owner are comprised under three heads,

namely: (a) the right of possession and the right to recover possession; (b)

the right of use and enjoyment; and (c) the right of disposition and that

"these three factors are all essential to (he idea of ownership, but need not

all be present in an equal deb'Tee at one and the same time". This statement

was recognised by tlle Privy Council in me case of Attorney General v.

Herath (p.C), 62 NLR 145, at 148 that the said statement is applicable to

this Country as well. In the case of Graham v. Ridley S.A.L.R. E):-l I T.O.P.

476, Greenberg. J stated

Dutch Law and the nature and style of the action and the raising of issue

No.2 on behalf of tile Plaintiff and dle production of title deeds by tile

Plaintilf in dle present case clearly and unambiguously show that tile action

chosen by the Plaintiff is one of rei vinr/icalio based on the right of

ownership which is the very essence of rei vliJ(/icatio action. The pleading

possession and damages in a rei Vlilr/icaUo action by iL~elf would not in my

view, convert the action into a possessory action.

1551 The Plaintiff has clearly chosen her cause of action/s and dle character

of the action in the pleadings and in the prayer and sought a declaration of

title and ejectment on dle basis of the said Title Deeds. I hold dlat the

mere use of the word 'title' and/or 'possession' in paragraph 8 of the

Amended Plaint and tlle reliefs for a declaration of title and possession in

the prayer would not mean til at the Plaintitr has incorporated two dillerent

causes of action in a rei vlilr/icalio action and a possessory action.

(b) Question of Prior Peaceful Possession and Ouster giving rise to a

Presumption of Title

1561 Mr. .layasinghe however, stressed that the Plaintiff is entitled to a

declaratory remedy as the Plaintiff who had prior peaceful possession was

subsequently ousted by tlle Defendants without any proof of title or title of

a third party or dleir own leave and license to occupy the disputed land in

question. In support of his contention, Mr. Jayasinghe submitted that

(i) Despite the said partition decree, the said Allis who was tlle

husband of the Plaintiff kept on possessing the whole land which

was tlle sul~ject matter of dle DistTict Court of Ke!,ralle Case No.

8890 together with another portion of land adjourning to lot :1

towards tlle east in Plan No. 1176 as the said Sedara and Setllie

did not come to possess the said lots; <md

[JC KECALLE FINAL 3819/L DC f - 02-13-99

(ii) As the said Sethie and Sedera did not obtain a writ of possession

!i'om the District Court of Keg-aile in respect of the said lots, the

said Allis kept on possessing the said two lots without any

obstruction until such time the Defendants encroached upon the

said two lot~ and dispossessed the Plaintiff from the middle of

1986; and

(iii) The PlaintilT and her husband, Allis possessed the said land for

over a period of 10 years and acquired prescriptive title to the

same.

1571 The Plaintitl' has stated in evidence that (i) her husband, Allis who

became entitled to the contagious land called 'Delgahamulahena' morefully

described in schedule I of the Amended Plaint, by Deed No. 32274 dated

20.08.1953 (P3) mortgaged the said land to H. Geor/-,riana, who filed an

action against the said Allis in the District Court of Kegalle; (ii) by a decree

entered in the District Court, the said land was auctioned and the said H.

Geor/-,riana purchased tile said property (P4) by a Fiscal Conveyance dated

11.12.1959; (iii) upon a settlement between the parties on 20.09.1962 (P4),

tile Plaintiff purchased the said property from Georgiana by Deed of

Transfer No. 6521 dated 30.03.1964 (P2); (iv) by Deed No. 3633 dated

22.08.1958 (P I), her husband, Allis transferred his rights to her in tile

whole land described in the I" schedule to the said Deed and lot 3 in Plan

No. 1167 made by J Aluvihare, Licensed Surveyor; and (v) the Plaintifl'

continued to possess the said land peacefully until such time she was

ousted by the Defendants in 1986.

1581 I shall now turn to tile question of tile claimed 'peaceful possession' of

tile Plaintiff in lot~ I, 2 and 3 in Plan No K 2369 prior to mid-1986 and

her 'unlawful dispossession' from the said two lots as claimed by the

PlaintilT in her pleadings and evidence. The Plaintiff has raised issues nos.

DC KEGALLE FINAL 3819/L DCF - OH3-99

.'

...

3 and 4 to indicate this position. The learned Additional District./udge has

answered the said two issues on the basis that the PlaintifT had possession

only in lot 3 in Plan No. 117(j and the claims of encroachment and ouster

were not proved by the PlaintifT to the satisfilction of the Court.

1591 It is trite law that possession comprises both an oqjective and

subjective element, namely physical control (corpus) and the intention to

possess (animus pOSSJde/J(h) (Scholtz v FaileI' 1910 TPD 243 & Wille's

Principles of South African Law, (supra), p. 449). The physical element

(corpus) of possession, generally termed detentio (detention), consists of

Ule physical control, custody or occupation of the property, for example, in

the case of immovables, a person who occupies or cultivates the land or

part thereol; or occupies or keeps the key or places a supel\~sor in control

of a house or building or part ulereof, has delelltio (Supra).

1601 The control required for acquisition of possession by occupation IS

more stringent than that required for acquisition by transfer, for the latter

occurs with the consent of the transferor and thus, in order to gain

possession by occupation, a person must seize the land or part of the

shipwreck publicly ( Voet 41 .. 2.9, Supra).

1611 On the other hand, the physical possession need not be exercised in

person, but it may be exercised by an agent on behalf of the principal or a

servant on behalf of the master (D 41.2.3.10, Grotius 2.2.4, Voet 41 ,2,1).

Apart from ule physical control, a person must have the intention or will to

possess (animus poss/denrh). This means that legal capacity to possess

must exist, Ule intention must be directed towards exercising control for

self and there must be awareness that control is being exercised over

specific property (Wille's Principles of South AIi-ican Law, (Supra, p. 450).

DC KF:GALLE FINAL 381WL DCF - 0243-99

1621 Moreover, for the dispossession to occur, first, the Plaintiff must

establish that the necessary physical and mental elements existed and by

the unlawful acts of the Defendants, she lost the possession. Mr. jayasinghe

submitted that although the Defendants called S.P. Ukkuamma to establish

the title and possession in the disputed portions of land, she has admitted

in evidence that after she sold the land to her brodler Dharmadasa in

1967, she did not possess the 1,U1cl. He furdler submitted dlat dle

Defend<Ults did not call her brothers or her husband through him,

Ukkuamma claimed to have possessed the land as she was living outside

the village after marriage.

1631 The Defendants had called S. P. UkkuanJma to establish that

Sirisuriya and Dissanayake derived dle rights of Sethie in lot 2 and

Sirisoma derived the rights of Sedara in lot 5 in Plan No. 1176 according to

the pedigree pleaded in dleir Amended Answer. Her evidence dlat Sethie

was her mother and Sedara was her grandfadler (fadler of Sethie) was not

challenged by the Plaintiff at the trial. In fact, dle Plaintiff has admitted in

evidence that l lkku<unma is an heir of dle Sethie and dlUS, her relationship

with Sethie and Sedera was not in dispute.

1641 Ukkuamma's evidence was that (i) upon the demise of Sedera, his

rights devolved on his daughter Sethie and upon her demise, her rights in

lot 2 and 5 devolved on her (Ukkuamma) and her 7 brothers and sisters,

nanJely, Piyasiri Alwis, Sopiya, Gunawathie, Simon, Jayasinghe and

Dharmadasa; (ii) she conveyed her undivided rights to her brother,

Piyasiri Alwis on Deed No. 12053 dated 04.12.1967 (V I) and thereafter,

Sirisoma, Sirisuriya <U1d Dissanayake derived dle said rights according to

dle pedigree pleaded in the Amended Answer. As regards possession in lot

2 and 5 in Plan No. 11 76, dle testimony of Ukkuamma was that initially,

her mother Sethie and father Siripina possessed lot 2 and 5 in Plan No.

I)C KEGALLE FINAL 3819!L I)CF - 02./3-99

...

..

1176 and her father Siripina planted trees including coconut trees on the

said lot, and alter their demise, their children possessed the said land and

the Plaintilf never possessed the said two lots.

1651 Ukkuamma has further stated in e\~dence that since she was li\~ng

outside the ~llage alter her marriage, her husband used to visit the land

and collect coconut on her behalf and alter she sold her shares in lot 2

and 5 by Deed No. 1205:1 on 04.12.1967 to her brolher Alwis, she did not

have possession in lot 2 and !i in Plan No. 1176 alter 04.12.1%7. It

appears, however, that the Delendants claim the remaining shares of her

brothers and sisters were sold to Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and Dissanayake in

1985 and 1986 respectively as described by Ukkuamma and the relevant

Deeds marked allhe trial.

1661 Even if it is assumed that the Defendant, did not call the brother and

husband of l lkkuamma to establish their possession in lot 2 and 5 in Plan

No. 1176 prior to the transler of their shares, the Plaintilf who asserted that

she had prior peaceful possession exclusively in the disputed lots from

19!i5 irrespective of the fact that the linal partition decree was entered in

1955 allotting lot, 2 and !i to Sethie and Sedara, must prove her prior

peaceful possession and subsequent ouster from the said lots.

1671 The Plaintilf while I.,riving evidence at the trial has stated that her

husband Allis possessed the whole land (lots 1-:1 in Plan No. K 23(9) even

before 1958 and the Defendants having entered into the said land in 1986,

erected a fence to separate lot 2 from lot I and 3 and ousted her Irom the

said lot, in the middle of 1986. P.O. Gunadasa who is the brother of the

Plaintilf also stated that he had knovvn about the disputed land lor over :10

years and his sister possessed the said lots until she was ousted by the

Delendants Irom the said lots in 1986.

[)C KEGALLE FINAL 3819/1. [)CF - 02-J3-99

1681 A perusal of the Plan No. 1176 dated 19.02.1955 made by ].

Aluvihare, Licensed Surveyor [or the partition action reveals that this

evidence with reg-ard to the erection of a fence is not credible. The said

Plan reveals that Ulere is a rock in lot 2 in Plan No. 1176 and a fixed live

wire fence exists between lot 2 and 3 in the said Plan made in 1955. It

seems to me ulat lot 2 in the said PI<m No. 1176 dated 19.02.1955 had

been separated [rom ule Plaintill's lot 3 in Plan o. 1176 long time ago

and the same [ence exists between lots I and 2 in Plan No. K 2469 dated

28.1 1.1989 marked 'X'.

1691 A pellJsal of Plan made by T.N. Cadar and Mr. Ranatunga (X) also

reveals that Ule PlaintilT's lot (lot 2 in Plan marked 'X' and lot CI in Plan

No. 2563) had been separated from Ule northem Palt of the land (lot I in

Plan marked 'X' and lot 2 in Plan No. 1176). Mr. Ranatung-d, Licensed

Surveyor has stated in evidence that the said fence was nearly 10-15 yeal's

old and the said fence is the same wire fence refeITed to in Mr. Aluvihare's

Plan No. 1176 (page 91 of ule briel).

1701 Accordingly, the Plaintill's lot 3 in Plan o. 1176 had been separated

from lot 2 in the said Plan by an old wire fence which had existed prior to

the date of ule final decree entered in the said partition action on

18.03.1955 (V3). The [inal partition plall No. 1176 made by Mr. J

Aluvihare does not state that a live wire fence exists between lot 3 and 5.

Mr. Ranatunga, who made the Plall marked 'X' in 1989 has, however,

stated in his Plall and e\~dence ulat a live wire fence existed between lots I

and 2 and 2 and 3 of his PI,m No. K 2469 mal-ked 'X' at the time of his

survey. Even it is assumed that there was no live wire [ence existed to

separate lot 3 Ii-om lot 5 in 1955, the question al-ises is whether that itself

establishes that the Plaintiff possessed lot 5 in Plan No. 1176 Ii-om 1955

irrespective of the final decree entered in Ule said pal-tition action allotting

..

lots 2 and 5 in Plan No. 1176 to Sedera and Sethie as claimed by the

Plaintiff'in her evidence.

1711 Mr. .Jayasinghe submitted that the learned Additional District .Judge

was wrong in holding that the inquiry held by the Government Agent into

the application made by the Plaintilf to obtain an electricity connection

over lot 5 in Plan No. 1176 shows that the Plaintiff was not the owner or lot

5 as the inquiry was held in 199:1 after the I" Defendant occupied the said

lot.

1721 Even if the said inquiry was held after the I" Ddendant occupied lot 5

in Plan 1176 as submitted by the le,mled Counsel for the Plaintiff, the

crucial question is as to what was the Plaintiff doing when the Delendants

unlawfully encroached onto her land ,md dispossessed her from lots I and

:1 in Plan No. K 24G9. JI' it was the position of the Plaintilf that her husband

planted trees and possessed Ule whole land since 1955 without any

disturbance from Sethie and Sed,u'a and she was ousted by the Defendants

unlawfully, she could have made a complaint to the Police about such

unlawful acts of the Delendants.

17:11 The Plaintitf has at least hliled to produce a single complaint made to

the Police or Grama Sevaka Niladhari or any other person in authority to

substantiate her claim that she possessed the whole land from 1955 but the

DefendanL~ ousted her in Ule middle of 1986. The evidence of the

Plaintilf at page liS of the brier confirms this position:

1741 Mere statement made by the Plaintiff that 'I possesses the land Iiom

1955" or "Allis Planted plantation Iiom 1955" or "I was ousted by the

Defendants in 1986" and mere statement of her brother Gunadasa that

"The Plaintiff possessed the land from 1955" or "The Plaintiff was ousted

by the Defendants" are not sullicient to establish the prior peaceful

possession of the Plaintiff and subsequent dispossession by the Defendants

in 1986. The Plaintilf and Gunadasa have clearly failed to show the

manner in which the Plaintiff and Allis held possession of the disputed

land.

1751 Except for said mere oral statemenl~ of the Plaintiff and her brother

Gunadasa that the owners of lot 2 and 5 in Plan o. 1176 did not take out

a writ and obtain possession thereof and that the Plaintiff and her husband

possessed the land for 30 years from 1955, the Plaintiff has not adduced

credible and independent evidence to establish prior peaceful possession

and her subsequent dispossession by the Defenri<mts in the middle of

1986. No independent H~tnesses such as a Grama iladhari was called or

any credible documentary proof was produced by the Plaintiff as to the WdY

in which the Plaintiff possessed the land and that she had prior peaceful

possession from 1955 ,md thereafter, the Defendants unlawfully erected

fences (md ousted her Iiom lot 1 <md 3 in PI<Ul No. K 2469 (lot 2 <Uld 5 in

Plan No. 1176) in 1986.

1761 It is highly improbable and unbelievable that the Plaintiff would have

kept silent ~thout making any complaint to a Police Officer or the Granla

DC KEGALLE FINAL 3819/L DCF - 02./3-99

..

Niladhari or any other person in authority if the Plaintilf in fact, possessed

the whole land from 1955, reaped the benelits from plantation without any

disturbance and was lorcibly ousted in 1986 by the Defendants by erecting

a fence to sep,u'ate lot 3 from lot 2 and 5 in Plan No. 1176 as correctly

observed by the learned Additional District judge in the judgment.

1771 I hold under such circumstances, that this is not a case in which a

presumption of title arises in favour of tlle Plaintilf in the nature of a

possessory remedy where the dominium need not be proved strictly when

the Plaintilf has failed to establish by adducing credible and independent

evidence tllat she had prior peaceful possession in lots 1 and 3 in Plan No.

K 2469 li'om 1955 and that the DelCndants encroached onto the said lots,

erected fences and ousted her from the said lots.

1781 In the present case, the Plaintiff has absolutely no contractual nexus

with the Defendants arising from a contract or otherwise (overholding

lessee or tenanL- Patllirana v .layasundere & Dr. Rasiah .leyara,jah and

another v. Yogambihai Thambirajah nee- Renganathan Pillei) or any other

nexus arlsmg from any legal oblig-ation beLween the land and a party

(Nandasena Wickramasekara Rajapaksha v. Willll1iarachchi

Kankanamalage Temawatllie) or a presumpLion of title arises in lavour of

the Plaintilf where the Plaintilf had earlier peaceful possession but

subsequently, she was ousted by the Defendant (Luwis Singho and Others

vs. Ponnamperuma (Supra) ,Uld Adam Ibraim Rawter and another v. A.

Ross (1880) 3 see 145 & Latheel' illld illlother v. Mansoof illld another

(upra),

1791 In my View, tllis action, cannot be treated as ,Ul action l'or the

declill'ation of title and ejectmenL on the basis that the Plaintiff was ousted

from prior peaceful possession, giving risc to a presumption of title in her

1)(' KECALLE FINAL 3819/L 1)(' F - 0243-9'1

favour obviating the need for her to establish title against the whole world

(Ill rem) in such special circumstances.

ISOI Under such circumstances, tile District COUIt has correctly assumed

tllat the type of the action chosen by the Plaintitf is one of rei VlIldicatio

and the cause of action arises on the basis of the sole /,'Tound of violation of

the right of ownership. For those reasons, I hold tllat the action filed by the

Plaintilf is based on a rei vlIldicatio action and the Plaintiff has not

incorporated two different causes of action in a rei VlIldicatio action and

possessory action in \~olation of section 35 (2) of the Civil Procedure

Code.

Title to Lot 1 and 3 depicted in Plan No. K 2469

ISII It is settled law that a Plaintiff who is seeking a declaratory relief in a

rei vlIldicatio action must prove and establish his title to tile land in dispute.

In the case ofWanilfaratne v . .Juwanis Appuhamy reported in 65 NLR 167,

tile Supreme Court stated that (i) in an action rei VlIldicatio, the Plaintiff

must set out his title on the basis on which he claims a declaration of title to

the land and must, in Court, prove that title alfainst the Defendant in tile

action; and (ii) it is imperative for tile Plaintiff to prove tllat the Plaintill is

tile owner of tile land in question and the Defendant is in possession of tile

land in question. Thus, a rei vlndicaa'o action arises Ii'om tile right of

dominium and it is an action II] rem (founded on ownership) and

there/ore, tile Plaintiti's ownership of the thing is tile very essence of rei

Vllldicatio action where tile main issue that arises for the adjudication is the

Plaintill's mvnership of the property.

IS21 It is also impOltant al tllis stage to consider the defences open to a

Delendant in an action rei VlI]dicatio. In Allis Appu v. Endris Hamy and

others (lS94) 3 SCR S7, WithersJ relelTing to the authority of Maynz Vol.

DC KECALLE FINAL 38191L nCF - 02.t3-99

I page 786 said that a Defendant in a rei vliJC/icaUo action can defend

himself (i) by denying Plaintiffs title, which must he strictly proved; (ii) by

setting up his own title and establishing a title superior to that of the

Plaintiff; (iii) prescription of the action; (iv) the plea of resjudicata; (v) right

of tenure under the PlaintitJ's as for U.5ufi-uct, pledge, lease, loan, etc. (vi)

right to retain possession sul~ject to indemnity Ii'om the Plaintiff under

et tradilae, that is, by the Plaintilf or his qualified agent, to him-the

Defendant-in possession; and (viii) the ./liS tertJi (the title or third parties-

one having a superior title to the Plaintifl).

1831 The Plaintifl~ however, so'ongly relied on Title Deeds No. 6521 dated

30.03.19G4 (P2) and No. 36:~:~ dated 22.08.1958 (PI) to establish her title

to the land described in the schedule to the Amended Plaint. The

Defendants have denied the Plaintilrs title and possession in lots 2 and 5

of Plan No. 1176 (lot I and 3 in Plan No. K 24(9) on the I,'Tound til at by

the linal decree of the partition action No. 8890, the said lots were allotted

to Sethie and Sedera and upon their demise, their rights devolved on

Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and Dissanayake according to tile averments contained

in their Amended Answer. At the hearing, Mr. Jayasinghe conceded that

the Plaintill's husband Allis was declared only entitled to lot 3 of Plan No.

1176 and lot 2 was declared entitled to Sethie and lot 5 was declared

entitled to Serle!'a in 19.')5 (V3).

1841 It is common ground tllat the Plan No. 1176 made by J. Aluvihare,

Licensed Surveyor is the Final Partition Plan in the District Court of

Kegalle partition action bearing No. 8890 (V2). By the Final Decree of the

said partition action dated 18.03. 1 ~)55 (V3), the Plaintilrs husband, Allis

became entitled only to lot 3 in the said Plan, which is only a portion of lot

IK KEGALLE FINALJRI9/L I)CF - 02.J3-')<)

2 in Plan No. K 2469. Lot 2 in the said Plan was allotted to Sethie and lot

5 in the said Plan was allotted to Sederoi.

1851 The land called 'Delagahamulanahena' morefully described in the

schedule to the Amended Plaint is about 42 lallas of paddy whereas the

extent of the land surveyed and depicted in Plan marked 'X' is only 3 acres

3 roods and 13.50 perches. The entirely of 'Delagahamulanahena' in

extent of 42 lahas of paddy morefully described in schedule 1 of tlle

Amended Plaint had been included in tlle Mortg-oige Bond 32274 dated

20.08.1953 (P3), Fiscal Conveyance No. 8967 dated 12.1959 (P4), title

deed No. 6521 dated 30.03.1964 (P2) and the first schedule to the Deed

No. 3633 dated 22.08.1958 (PI). However, the 2nd schedule to the Deed

No. 3633 (PI) is only lot 3 in Plan No. 1176 (V2), which is the lot allotted

to Allis by tlle said Final Decree and it has no reference whatsoever, to lots

2 and 5 depicted in Plan No. 1176 dated 19.02.1955 (V2)

1861 Although the boundaries in the said Deeds, except the 2nd schedule

to the Deed No. 3633 (P I) refer to the entirety of tlle land called

'Delagahamulanahena' and tally with the boundaries with the Plan No. K

2469 m,u'ked 'X', a portion of the said land, namely, lots 2,3 ,md 5 in Plan

No. 1176 had been included in the earlier partition action No. 8890/1'.

The husband of the Plaintitl' was only entitled to lot 3 in Plan No. 1176,

which is a portion of lot 2 in Plan No. K 2469 marked 'X'.

1871 The Plaintiff has not disclosed lhat her husb,md was only entitled to

lot 3 in Plan No. 1176 in her pleadings and she had attempted to deny tlle

existence of tlle said partition action in her evidence at page 94 of the

brief). The Final Partition Decree entered in the said p<titition action on

18.03. 1955 (V3) is a decree in rem and is final <tild conclusive in terms of

[)C KEGALLE FINAL 3819!L OCF - 0243-99

section 48 of the Partition Law and binds the whole world, including the

Plaintilf and her husband, Allis who was a party to the said partition action

1881 It is crystal clear that although the Plaintitl's Deed No. 6521 marked

P2 and Deed N o. :~6:3:3 refer to the entirety of the land called

'Delagahamulanahena', all these Deeds had been executed long after the

date of the final decree entered on 18.03.1955. By the said final decree,

the Plaintiff was only entitled to lot :3 in Plan No.1176 marked V2 and the

Plaintiff has not produced the single Deed to establish tllat she has title to

lot 2 and 5 in Plan No. 1176 (V2) atter the tinal decree in the said partition

action was entered in the said District Court on 18.03.1955.

1891 The Plaintiff is only entitled to lot :3 in Plan No. 1176 which is only a

portion of Plan No. K 2469 marked 'X' as correctly decided by the learned

Additional DistrictJudge in her judl,'lnent dated 18.01.1999. On tlle other

hand, the said Sethie was entitled to lot 2 in Plan No. 1176 which

corresponds to lot 1 in Plan No. K 2469 and Sedera was entitled to lot 5 in

Plan No. 1176 which corresponds to lot 3 in Plan No. K 2469 as correctly

obselved by the learned Additional District Judge in tlle said judgment.

I J nder such circumstances, the Plaintiff has no title to lots 2 and 5 in Plan

No. 1176 or lots I and 3 in Plan No. K 2469 as correctly held by the

learned Additional District Judge in her judl,'lnent dated 18.01.1999.

Hence, I am of tlle view that the Plaintiff's rei vliJriicatio action fails.

The Question of Prescriptive Possession of the Plaintiff

1901 I shall now turn to the prescriptive righL~ claimed by the Plaintilf as

indicated in her issue No.7. As stated earlier, mere statements of the

Plaintiff and her brother Gunadasa til at the Plaintiff possessed lots I and 3

!)C KEGALLE FINAL 3819/1. DC F - 0243-()9

in Plan No. K 2469 lor 30 long years from 1955 is insufficient to prove

prescriptive rights of the Plaintiff in the said lots. Apart fi'om the mere

statements of tile Plaintiff and her brother Gunadasa, the Plaintilf has

failed to adduce credible evidence to prove that she had undisturbed,

uninterrupted and adverse possession in lot I and 3 in Plan No. K 2469

for a period of 10 years as correctly held by tile learned Additional District

Judge in herjud!,'lnentdated 18.01.1999.

The Failure of the learned Additional DistrictJudge to answer Issues Nos.

15 and 16 raised on behalf of the Defendants

1911 At the hearing. Mr. .lajasinghe strenuously submitted that although the

learned Additional District] udge was bound to answer all the issues, she

has fitiled to answer the issues 15 and 16 raised by tile Defendants in the

judgment and therefore, the impugned judgment is a judgment

pronounced in violation of the provisions of section 187 of the Civil

Procedure Code. The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff fluther submitted

that such fitilure is a fatal error on the part of tile learned Additional

DistTictJ udge and thus, tile judgment delivered by the learned Additional

DistTict Judge is a nullity. He invited us to set aside the jud!,'lnent dated

18.01.1999 on tilat ground alone and enter judgment in favour of the

Plaintiff.

1921 In SUppOIt of his contention, Mr. .Jqjasinghe relied on the decisions

reported in Muthukrishna v. Gomes and otilers 1994 (3) Sri LR 101,

Fernando v. Ramanathan 16 NLR 337, Ramani Karunanayake v. Girlie

1941 A perusal of the judgment dated 18.01.1999 reveals that the learned

Additional District.l udge has proceeded to answer all the issues except

issues 15 and 16 raised on behalf of the DefendanL~ at the trial. The said

issues 15 and 16 revolve around 'misjoinder of parties' on the basis that the

Plaintiff had wrongly made the Defendants, party to the action instead of

the owners ofloL~ I <Uld a depicted in Plan No. K 2469 marked 'X'.

1951 Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

"717e judl/menl shall cOIIIlUil a cOllcis'e statement or dIe ("t5e, dIe

pOJill.s lor delenninalion, dIe deCJ:5ioll dJereoll, ;/J1d dIe rea.5ons lor

su('h deci5ioll alld dIe o/)fillons or dIe assessors (If' allY) shall be

prelixed to d7e.iudgmellt and signed by such assessors respeco've/y. "

1%1 The general oQject of section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code is that

in suits in which issues have been !i'amed, the Court shall state it~ finding

or decisions, with the reasons therefor, upon each separate issue raised on

behalf of the palties. The two cases, namely, Muthukrishna v. Gomes and

others and Hamani Karunanayake v. Girlie Wimalaratne (supra) cited by

the learned Counsel f()r the Plaintiff were decided, however, on section

147 of the Civil Procedure Code as the question that arose for

consideration was whether an issue requiring the recording of evidence can

be regarded as a preliminary issue which can be dealt with under section

147 of the Civil Procedure Code. 111 that context, the Court of Appeal held

in both cases that the judges of tJle original courL~ should, as far as

DC KF:CALLE FINAL 381WL I)CF - OH3-'l9

practicable, go through the entire trial and answer all the issues unless they

are certain that a pure question or law without the leading of evidence

(apalt from formal evidence) can dispose of the case.

1971 In the case of De Silva v . ./ellam Beebee (1909) ACR 52 decided on

20.08.1909, the three Defendants were sued on a number of promissory

notes alleged to have been made by them in favour of one Hadjiar,

deceased. The I" Defendant denied the making of the notes and pleaded

that they had been materially altered while the 2'" and 3'd Defendants

admitted having signed the notes, but pleaded that they were minors at that

time and that certain palt payments had been made by them. The first two

issues were with reg-ard to the signature of the I" Defendant and the

material alteration pleaded by her. The other issues were directed to the

question of the alleged minority of the 2'''' and 3'd Defendants and the Palt

payments relied on. After some evidence was led on the I" and 2'" issues,

the trial judge entered judgment ag-ainst the I" Defendallt and fixed the

case for trial on the other issues for a later date. t Imler such circumstal1ce,

the Court of Appeal held that:

"I tlUilk tile judge ought not, el'en wldl the consent of the parties, to

have givell a separatejudgment on the fir.st two issues. He ought to

h;lVe tried all tile issues and l{ivell one judgment lil the whole case. It

is very lilconvenient to by a case piecemeal ill7d as In tile present

case, it causes delay IiI tile finaJjudgmenl of tile case, when tllal is an

appeal ag;uilsl thejudpnelll all one or more of the issues before tile

others are bied'~

1981 The principle emerging from the provIsion of section 187 Civil

Procedure Code and the decided cases is that the COUlt would generally

try all issues and pronounce judh'lnent on all such issues except where a

I)C KEGALLE FINAL3819/L IKF -02~3-99

pure question of law touching upon either the jurisdiction of the Court or

the creation of any bar to the suit by any law arises and in such case, the

case can be disposed of without evidence being led under section 147 of

the Civil Procedure Code.

1991 There is no doubt that the learned Additional DistrictJudge has failed

to answer the issues 15 and 16 raised on behalf of the Defendants at the

trial and pronounced the judgment on other issues in dismissing the

Plaintilrs action. It is imperative It)r the Judges of the original courts to

answer all the substantive issues which relate to the rights and interests of

the parties as no complete and etlective judgment can be passed without

deciding the interest~ of the parties indicated in such issues unless they are

certain that a pure question of law can be disposed of without evidence

being led under section 147 of the Civil Procedure Code.

11001 The pivotal question that has to be determined 111 this appeal,

however, is whether the Plaintitl's action ought to be dismissed on the

simple ground of the failure to answer the issues 15 and 16 of mi~ioinder

of the parties and the judgment oughL to be entered in favour of the

Plaintiff lor the solitary reason of such lailure to answer the said two issues.

The nature of the Issues 15-16 raised by the Defendants

11011 M r. N anayakkara, the learned Counsel lor the Delendants, however,

submitted that the failure to answer issues 15 and 16 was not a ground to

set aside the judl,'1l1ent and enter judgment f()r the Plaintilf as the Plaintiff

had lailed to establish the ingredient~ in a rei vindicatio action. In view of

the above discussion, it is important to consider the nature and the basis of

the issues 15-16 raised on behalf of the De!endant~. The issues 15-16 had

DC KEGALLE FINAL 3819/1. IKF - 02-13-99

been raised mainly on the basis that the Defendants are only licensees of

the owners of lots I and 3 depicted in Plan No. K 2469 marked 'X' and

thus, the Plaintiff cannot maintain the action without making the owners of

the land as necessary parties to the action (Vide- paragraphs 6, 16 and 17

of the Amended Answer).

11021 The Plaintiffs position at the trial was that there is no evidence

whatsoever, to establish that the Defendants were the licensees of the

owners of lots I and 3 depicted in Plan marked 'X' and thus, the Plaintiff

correctly instituted this action against the persons who are in unlawful

possession of lots I and 3 in the said Plan.

11031 It will be therefore useful to refer to the relevant provisions of the

Civil Procedure Code, relating to misjoinder of parties and consider

whetller the failure to answer the issues 15 and 16 on misjoinder is a

ground to regard the jud/,'Jllent a nullity as submitted by tlle learned

Counsel for tlle Plaintiff. It seems to me that section II of the Civil

Procedure Code permits all persons in whom the right to relief claimed is

alleged to exist jointly, severally or in the alternative, in respect of the same

cause of action, to be joined as Plaintins, suqject to the other provisions of

the Civil Procedure Code. Similarly, section 14 of the Civil Procedure

Code pennit~ all persons ag-dinst whom tlle right to any relief is alleged to

exist, jointly, severally or in the alternative in the same cause of action to be

joined as Defendants. Section 18 permits Courts on or before tlle hearing

upon application of eitller parLy to strike out tlle name of any party

improperly joined as Plaintiff or Defendant or order that any Plaintiff be

made Defendant or that any Defendant be made a Plaintiff and tllat tlle

name of any person who ought to have been joined, whether as Plaintiff or

Defendant or whose presence before the court may be necessary in order

DC KECALLE FINAL 3819/L DCI' -02~3-99

to enable the court to etlectively and completely to adjudicate upon and

seUle all the questions involved in that action, be added.

11041 With reg-ard to the procedure to be liJllowed in raising the o~jections

to the mi~joinder of parties, section 22 provides as follows:

"Alloi!jecuolls lor w;ull oFpardes, or /oljolilder OFp;ulies who have

IlO liIterest Iii die acdoll, or kJr tile mi'ijoliJder oFco-plaIiJUlli; or co-

de/enr/allts, shall be takell at tile eiuliest 0ppOltunity, iUJd lil ;ill cases

bekJre tile he;U1ilg. And allY such oLijccdoll /Jot so taken sh;ill be

deemed to have beell waived by tile r/e/end;UJt."

11051 The lailure to follow these steps by the party who seeks an ol~jection,

by itself, was sutlicient ground to refuse him permission to Ii'ame an issue

on misjoinder, let alone answer t11e issue in the aflirmative (Ad lin

Fernando and Another v. Lionel Fernando and Others (I99!i) 2 Sri LR 25,

at 29). I t appears, therelore, that if any ol~jection to misjoinder or parties is

raised by a Defendant, it has to be done belore the hearing and it is not

open to a Defendant to await the framing of issues by t11e parties (Ad lin

Fernando and Another v. Lionel Fernando and Others (Supra, at 28). The

rationale behind these provisions is that the Court should not be called

upon to embark upon an iIlquilY into whether there was a misjoinder of

parties or causes of action, after the trial proper has commenced, and

thereby side-track the Court Ii-om deciding the substantial issues in the

case, into decidiIlg questions of procedure. (Supra).

110(i1 It is important to refer to the f()lIowing statement made by Ranar~jaJ

at page 27 in t11e case of Adlin Fernando and Anot11er v. Lionel Fernando

and Others (supra):

BC KEGALLE FINAL 3819/L BCF - 02-13-99

"\If/hat i5 liTlpOltant, howevel; i5, dlat dIe provisions of' dIe CiVil

Procedure Code relauilg to dIe joinder of' parties are rules of'

procedure and not substantive lalf' and hence, Courts should adopt a

commOJJsence approach IiI deCldlilg quesuoJJs at m/~olilder or

llon:Jolilde/: "

11071 In the present case, the Defendants pleaded in the Amended Answer

that the action cannot be maintained insofar as there is a fitilure to join the

necessary parties (vide-p,u'agraph 17), The Defendants did not raise such

objection of non-joinder of necessary parties for a determination of Court

before the hearing of the action and the issues in question were raised

during the course of the evidence of the Plaintiff. The parties, however,

continued with the trial, leaving the trial judge to deal with the issue of

misjoinder so lar as regards the right~ and interest~ of the parties actually

before it along with the substantive issues.

11081 Section 17 of the Civil Procedure Code however, el1joys a judge not

to dismiss an action lor mi~joinder or non~joinder of parties and in such

event, the wrong party should be struck oil and the necessary amendments

to the pleadings made (Wallaraka alias Moratota Thero Sobitha Thero v.

Amunug-dJl1a Ratnapala Thero 1981 (I) Sri LR 20 I). Further, section 17

provides:

"No acuoll shall be defeated by reason at dIe m/~olnder or non-

./olilder of'parties, iU7d dw COUlt may IiI el'e'Yacuo/7 deallf'idl dIe

matter IiI conuVI'ersy so lilr as Ic:g-dlyls dIe lights and liltelC:sts otdle

pilrues actually be/ore it ..... "

11091 It is settled that there is no provision in the Civil Procedure Code or

any other law requiriBg an action to be dismissed by reason of misjoinder

DC KEGALLE FINAL3819/L DCF - 0143-99

$

of parties without giving an opportunity to the Plaintiff to amend the Plaint

so that the Plaintiff can proceed against the other Defendant/s. (Dingiri

Appuhamy v. Talakolawewe Pangnananda Thero (j7 NLR 89) and

Ranasinghe v. Fernando 69 NLR 115).

11101 III my View, section 17 gives wide powers to the COUIt to remedy

mi~joinder or non-joinder of parties by striking out unnecessary or adding

parties and thus, a misjoinder or non~joinder of parties is not a tatal to a

suit provided that the suit is of such a nature that the rights and interests of

the parties before the Court can be eflectively disposed of against the other

parties either by striking out unnecessalY or adding necessalY parties

(Sarkar, Code of Civil Procedure Vol. I.

11111 It seems to me that section 17 is a rule of procedure and not

substantive law as observed by Ranaraja J in the case of Adlin Fernando

,md Another v. Lionel Fernando and Others (supra) ,md hence, section 17

will have no application where, under the substantive law, the right~ and

interests of the parties before Court cannot be elfectively determined and

judgment can be entered. On the other hand, the rule in section 17 will not

have any application when a party whose presence is essential for U1e

continuation of the action and in whose absence, no ellective jud/,TInent can

be entered as such a party ought to have been joined in U1e action.

11121 In other words, the rule U1at 'no suit shall be defeated for mi~joinder

or non-joinder of parties' will have no application where the parties who

are not joined are essentially necessary parties to the suit and in whose

absence, no effective judgment can be passed. In such case, the misjoinder

or non~joinder of such a party may be latal to the suit. On U1e other hand,

non~joinder of a necessary party may be tatal to the suit, if the Defendant

succeeds in showing U1at U1e PlaintifT had no cause of action against the

DC KEGALLE FINAL 3RI9/L IKF - 02-13-99

Defendants (Ramnadl Exports Private Ltd vs Chairman, Air India, AIR

2003 Del. 461, 466) and a judgment passed in such circumstances would

be a nullity.

11131 It is pertinent to consider a situation where a judgment is passed

wiiliout answering some issues which relate to ilie rights and interests of ilie

parties or real issues between the parties and no complete and eflective

judgment can be passed widlOut deciding ilie interests of ilie parties

indicated in such issues are not answered by dle Court. For example, in the

case of The Finance Company Limited v. P. Kusumawadlie (supra), dle

case proceeded to trial against ilie 2'~ and 3'" Defendants upon issues 1 to 6

and 7 to 15 raised on behalf of ilie Plaintiff and ilie 2'~ and 3'" Defendants.

The District Court proceeded to answer issues 1 to 6 of ilie Plaintiff and 14

and 15 out of dle issues raised by ilie 2"" and 3'" Defendants and dismissed

ilie action against ilie 2'~ and 3'" Defendants.

11141 The action was dismissed on the basis that dle 2"" and 3"' Detendant~

who were the guarantors to the PlaintifT for the payment of all moneys

which dle 1" Defendant might become due and owing under dle hire

purchase agreement were not parties to ilie setdement between the 1"

Defendant and a third party marked 'X' and dle subsequent setdement

between the Plaintiff and the 1" Defendant based on the said setdement

marked 'X' and hence, the 2"" and 3'" Defendants were not liable for the

violation of dle terms embodied in ilie said agreement marked 'X'.

However, ilie Defendants' position that their liabilities under ilie hire

purchase agreement ended wiili dle agreement iliat had existed between

ilie I" Defendant and the third party as indicated in the Defendants' issues

7 -13 were not answered by dle learned District.} udge.

DC KEGALLE FINAL 3819/L ocr - 0243-99

, .

11151 The COUlt or Appeal held that the railure to answer the 2'"' and 3'"

Delendants' issues, whether the liabilities of the 2'"' and 3'" Delendants

ended with the agreement that existed between the I" Delendant and a

third party prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties. The Court or

Appeal lurther held that the lailure to answer the said issues was not in

compliance with the requirements in section 187 or the Civil Procedure

Code and hence, the case was sent back for are-trial.

11161 It seems to me that in the said case, the question whether the

liabilities or the 2'"' and 3'" Defendants under the hire purchase agreement

ended with the al:,'Teement marked 'X' was a crucial issue that related to the

rights and interests or the parties under the substantive law. The judgment

could not have been pronounced in dismissing the Plaintiffs action without

answering the said crucial issues and therefore, the failure to answer the

said issues definitely prejudiced the substantial rights and interests or the

Plaintill' and the 2'''' and W' Defendants.

11171 The learned Counsel ror Ule Plaintill' r urther relied on Ule decision

or the COUlt of Appeal in Karuketiya v. Karuketiya CA 420-421/94

decided 04.09.2009. The said decision was a partition case in which the

parties originally raised 9 points or the contest and Ule Attorney-General

who was added to the case raised points or contest Nos. 10 -13. The

Plaintitl' raised one more issue numbered 14. The learned DistrictJudge

answered 12 points or the contest but (ailed to answer the other points of

Ule contest. The appellants in their statements of claim stated that the

corpus or the action should be limited to lot 3 in Plan No. 3335 and

prayed lor Ule exclusion or lots I and 2 in Plan No. 335 on Ule basis that

those lots are State Lands and the same had been given to the 2"" to 4"'

Delendants on an annual permit. The added Delendant sought to exclude

nc KEGALLE FINAL 3819/1. DC F - 02-/3-99

State Lands and produced the notices issued under section 38 of the Land

Acquisition Act. The District.Iudge, however, wrongly held that the land in

question is no longer a State Land. Under such circumstances, the Court of

Appeal held that the failure of the a-ial judge to answer all the substantial

points of contest related to the rights and interests of the parties makes the

judgment not to be in conformity with the provision in section 187 of the

Civil Procedure Code.

11181 The pertinent question that anses under such circumstances IS

whether the mere failure to answer issues 15 and 16 related to the

mi~joinder or non-joinder of the Delendants would prejudice the right~

and interests of the parties currently before Court if a complete and

ellective judgment under the substantive law could have been passed

without answering tlle sole issue of misjoinder or non-joinder.

11191 If the rights and interests of tlle parties before COUlt cannot be

completely and etlectively determined and complete and effective reliefs

cannot be obtained against a palty under the substantive law in tlle absence

of a necessary party, tile judgment passed in such situation is fatal to the

suit or is a nullity. On tile otller hand, when tile rights and interests of the

parties actually before court can be completely and effectively determined

and judl,rment can be passed, it is not necessary to join any other party and

tile misjoinder or non-joinder of parties is not fatal to the suit.

11201 The facts of the present case are, however, completely diflerent Ii-om

the said cases relied on by Mr. Jayasinghe. In the present case, tile issue in

question was only related to a misjoinder or non-joinder of parties and the

interest~ of tile parties crystallised in other issues could be completely and

eflectively determined without the need for the joining of otller parties and

DC KEGALLE FINAL 3819JL OCF - OH3-99

...

J .

thus, the said decision can be distin/,'1lished from the facts of the present

case.

11211 In the present case, the Plaintiff has instituted a rei VliJdicatio action

against the Defendants who are said to be in unlawful possession of the

disputed lots 1 and 3 in Plan No. K 2469 marked 'X'. The Delendants

have claimed that they are in possession of the said lots as the licensees of

the owners of the said lots. Pnina lacie, there was no mi~ioinder of the

Detendant~ in the present case as the case has been instituted against the

persons who are said to be in unlawful possession of the disputed lot~

depicted in Plan marked 'X'.

11221 The substantive issues between the parties in the present case are: (i)

whether the Plaintiff has title to the disputed portions of land; (ii) if so,

whether the Delendants are in possession of the said property; (iii) if so,

whether tile Dele ndanL~ could succeed in any of the defences available to

them in a rei vliJ(/icatio action as indicated in tlleir pleadings; and (iv)

whether the PlaintiflS or Defendant~ have prescribed to tile land in

question. The rights and interests of tile Plaintiffs and the Defendants

currently before the Court are crystallised in other issues raised by the

parties and such issues could be completely and elIectively determined

without tile need for tile joining of other parties.

11231 For tllose reasons, I hold tllat tile failure to answer the issues 15 and

16 raised by the Defendants on 04.01.1995 had not prejudiced the

substantive right~ and interests of the parties currently before the Court and

the rights and interests of the parties as crystallised in other issues could be

completely and etlectively determined by the learned District Judge and

judgment pronounced Witllout any necessity to join any otller party in the

IJC KEGALLE FINAL 381'111. DCF - OH3-99

present action. Hence, the submission of the learned Counsel for the

Plaintiff fails.

Weaknesses of the Defendants' case

11 241 Mr. Jayasinghe strenuously argued that although Defendant~ had

lailed to prove that Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and Dissanayake had title to lots 2

and .5 in Plan No. 1176 or that they entered into the disputed portions of

land as licensees of Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and Dissanayake, tile learned

Additional District Judge erred in answering the Defendants' issues

numbers 9-13 in tlleir favour for the following reasons:

a. the Delendants admitted in their Amended Answer that they had

no title whatsoever, to the disputed land and that they are only

licensees of claimed owners of tile land;

b. tile Defendant~ did not call the said Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and

Dissanayake to establish that they had title or that the Delendants

entered into the disputed land with their leave and license;

c. tile Deed No. 827 dated 13. 11.1986 produced by tile Defendants

at tile trial had not been pleaded in the Amended Answer and it

was produced fiaudulently to establish that Ukkuanlma

possessed 10t .5 in Plan No. 11 76;

d. the DetendanL~ have pleaded in the Amended Answer that the

seller of Deed No. 827 was Piyasiri Alwis whereas the seller was,

in fact, llkkuamma;

e. although the I" Delendant stated in evidence that Piyasiri Alwis

sold his righL~ to llkkuanlma, it was not pleaded in the Amended

Answer;

f. although the I" Delend,Ult stated in evidence til at after

Ukkuamma sold her ri ght~ in 10t.5 to Piyasiri Alwis by Deed No.

nc KEGALLE FINAL J819/L ncr - OH3-99

, .

". .

12053 (V 4), the said Piyasiri All-vis ~vith his brothers and sisters

transferred Uleir shares back to Ukkuamma by Deed No. 123,

the Deed was not produced by Ule Defendant~ at the trial.

If251 As described, there is no issue ulat lot 2 in Plan No_ 1176 (lot I III

Plan No_ K 23(9) was allotted to Sedera and lot 5 in Plan No. flG7 (lot 3

in Plan No_ K 23(9) was allotted to Sethie_ It was not challenged at the trial

that the rights of Sedra devolved on Sethie and upon the demise of Seth ie,

her rights devolved on l Jkkuamma, Piyasiri All-vis, Sopiya, Simon,

Jayasinghe, Gunawathie and Dharmadasa.

112GI A perusal or the Deed No. 12053 marked V I reveals that the said

l Jkkuamma had transferred her right~ inherited Ii-om her mother Sethie to

Piyasiri AI~s in lot 2 and 5 depicted in Plan No_1176. The 1st Derendant

has stated in evidence that Piyasiri Alwis who got right~ Ii-om Ukkuamma

in lot 5 on Deed No. 1205 :~ V 4 re-transferred her rights to {Jkkuamma on

Deed No. 123. The said Deed was not however, produced by Ule

Del'endant~ at the n-ial. If the said Piyasiri Alwis together ~th his brothers

and sisters had re-transferred his rights to llkkuamma on Deed No. 123,

the I" Del'endant should have produced the said Deed No. 123 to establish

ule chain or tiue emanating Ii-om Sethie to Sirisuriya and Dissanayake as

claimed by him in his evidence. The I" Defendant has failed to produce

the said Deed at ule triaL

11271 A perusal of the Deed No. 2G321 marked V8 however, reveals ulat

the said Piyasiri Alwis who got rights on Deed No. 12053 (V I), together

WiUl Dharmadasa, Sopiya, Gunawathie, Simon, Jayasinghe and Siripina

(who got rights rrom his ~It:, Sethie) had n-anslerred their rights in lot 5 to

Somawathie. The said Somawathie by Deed No. 455 marked V7 had

transferred her rights to the said Alwis who by Deed No. 827 marked V6

OC KEGALLE FINAL 3819/ L OCF - 0243-99

had transferred his rights to Ukkmunma who by Deed No. 1082 marked

V 5 had transferred his rights to Sirisuriya and Dissanayake. The

Defendants have however, not mentioned the Deed No. 827 dated

13.11.1986 in the Amended Answer and the said Deed was produced by

the Defendants for the first time at the trial.

11281 If the said Piyasiri Alwis, together with his brothers and sisters

b"anslerred their rights to l Jkkuamma on Deed o. 123 as claimed by the

I" Defendant, the I" Defendant should have either produced the said

Deed or at least explained as to how the said Piyasiri A1wis together with

his brothers and sisters could have b"ansferred their rights to Somawathie

on Deed TO. 26321. The 1 st Defencl;mt has tailed to do so.

11291 Although it is stated in the said Deed No. 1082 dated 13.11.1986 that

the said Sirisuriya and Dissanayake had purchased the rights of

Ukkuamma in lot 5, the Defendants have not called the said Sirisuriya and

Dissanayake at the b"ial to establish that they having purchased the said

rights in lot 5 from Ukkuamma, continue to own lot 5 in Plan No.1 176 as

at the date of the institution of the action. For tJlose reasons, I am of the

,~ew that the Defendants have not satistied that Sirisuriya and Dissanayake

were entitJed to rights in lot 5 as pleaded in their pedigree. Hence, the

learned Additional Disb"ict Judge should have, in my view answered the

issue number II as tollows:

11- Not proved

11 301 The said llkkuamma who inherited Seth ie's rights had b"ansferred

her rights in lot 2 to Piyasiri Alwis on Deed No. 12053 marked V I. The

Defencl;mts have pleaded that tJle Dh;mnadasa along with his brothers and

.'

transferred his rights to Sirisoma. It seems to me, however, that the said

Deed No. 26317 had not heen produced hy the Delendants at the trial.

(Vide- page 205 of the brief).

11311 Although Dharmadasa could have t:ranslerred his undivided rights

inherited from his mother Sethie as stated in Deed No. 3064 marked VI 0,

there is no proof whatsoever, that his other brothers and sisters translerred

their rights to Dharmadasa on Deed No. 26317. Even if it is assumed that

Sirisoma was entitled to Dhannadasa's undivided rights in lot 2 of Plan No.

1176 on Deed No. 3064 marked VIO, tile said Sirisoma is not entitled to

the entirety of lot 2 in Plan No. 1176. For those reasons, I am of tile view

that the learned Additional District.J udge could not have held that

Sirisoma was entitled to the entirety of lot 2 in Plan No. 1176 marked V2

and she should have answered the said issue No.9 as follows:

9- Not proved

Prescriptive Rights of ilie Defendants and Status of Licensee

11321 The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff further aQ,'1led that tile

Delendants have failed to adduce evidence to prove that (i) they entered

into the disputed land on leave and license of Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and

Dissanayake and (ii) they had acquired prescriptive title to the disputed

land as they have admitted in their own pleadings tllat they are only

licensees of Sirisoma, Sirisuriya <md Dissanayake. He submitted tllat

accordingly, tile findings of the learned Additional Dist:rict .Judge to the

Derendant~' issues Nos. 10 (leave and license) 12 (leave and license) and

13 (prescription) in their favour are erroneous.

11331 The Delendants have admitted in their Amended Answer tlMt tlley

possess the disputed land as licensees of Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and

I)C KEGALLE FINAL 3819/L DC F - 0143-99

Dissanayake and raised issues Nos. 10 and 12 at the trial to indicate the

said position. However, they had not called Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and

Dissanayake to substantiate their position at the trial. I of the ,~ew that the

issues Nos. 10 and 12 should have been answered by the learned

Additional District judge as follows:

10- Not proved

12- Not proved

11341 The Defendants' issue No. 13 relates to the prescriptive rights of the

Defendants. It reads as follows:

"C).am. I:llJC,D EV@C:l @oS .l~5<X t1;5)@G5 f1!ol:ll 2563 (;,6!J 8@00 f1!ol:ll (w) = (e: (;,6!J ~ eJoS63i:llCx;G5 Oo@!G<l:lGlrn CoStOOcl c::JfC,eveD ~~ =

11351 The said issue has been formulated on the basis that the Defendants

ha'~ng entered into the possession of the disputed portions of land on

behalf of Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and Dissanayake acquired prescriptive title by

uninterrupted, undisturbed and adverse possession in the said land for

over a period of 10 years.

11361 The Defendants have claimed that they entered into the disputed

land on behalf of Sirisoma, Sirisuriya and Dissanayake in 1985 and 1986

respectively as their licensees. On their own pleadings, the Defendants

could not have succeeded in acquiring prescriptive title to the disputed

portions of land and tl1US, the learned Additional District J~dge should

have answered issue No. 13 in tlle negative as follows:

13- No

Effect of Findings to Issues Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 on the Dismissal of

the Plaintiff's Action

11371 The learned Counsel lor the Plaintiff strenuously argued that since

the Defendanl~ have I;tiled to adduce evidence to establish their own legal

title or title of their Masters or their own prescriptive title, or their lawful

right to possess the sul~iect matter, the learned Additional District Judge

was bound to enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiff.

11381 The linal question to be considered is whether the wrong findings of

the learned Additional District Judge to the said Delendants' issues

numbers 9, 10, II, 12 and 13 by themselves will vitiate judgment of the

learned Additional District Judge when the action was dismissed on the

basis that the Plaintiff has failed to establish titlc to the disputed portions of

land. In the present case, the learned Additional District Judge has not

hrranted a declaration of title in tavour of tlle Delendants as prayed for in

paragraph (b) of the Amended Answer and the Plaintitl's action was

dismissed on the sole basis tllat the Plaintifr has failed to prove her title to

the disputed portions of land (lot I and :1 in Plan No. K 2469 marked

'X').

If :191 The point is that this is a rei vlilr/icatio action and the burden is

clearly on the Plaintiff to establish the title pleaded and relied on by her in

her pleadings. As described, a Delendant in a rei Vlilr/icatio action can

delend himself liller alia, by denying tlle Plaintitl's title, which must be

strictly proved by tlle Plaintiff (Allis Appu v. Endris Hamy and others

(Supra) referring to the autllority of Maynz (Supra). The Plaintiff cannot

ask for a declaration of title in her favour merely on the strengtll that the

Delendanl~' title is poor or not established. This principle was lucidly

[)C KEGALLE FINAL 381911. DC F - OH3-9')

stated by Herat]., in Wanilfdratne vs . ./uwanis Appuhamy 65 NLR 167, at

168 in the following terms

"It has been l;ud down now by d)Js COUlt dJat liJ an action rei

he c/aJins a dec/aratJon ortJde to the laJJd aJJd must, liJ Court, prove

11401 This statement of Herat./. in Wanilfaratne v . ./uwanis Appuhamy

(supra) was quoted with approval by G.P.S. de Silva J in Dharmadasa v .

./ayasena 1997 (3) Sri LR 327 (SC) at page 330. Thus, it is settled law that

in a l-ei VliJdicatJo action, the PlaintilT must prove his title and in

establishing her title, the Plaintilf cannot rely on the weaknesses of the

Defendant's title. In Samarapala v . ./agoda (1986) 1 Sri LR 378 also it was

held tllat (i) in a vindicatory suit, the Plaintiff must prove his title and

having failed to prove his own title, he cannot rely on the weaknesses of the

Delendant's title; and (ii) whatever the sl:renl,rth of the Delendant's case, if

tile Plaintiff fails to establish his title, the Plaintiffs case must necessarily

fail.

11411 It is settled law that in a l-ei vliJdicatJo action, the initial burden of

proof rests upon the Plaintiff to prove his title including identification of

the boundaries and once tile title become undisputed or proved by the

PlaintiH; the burden shifts to the Defendant to prove that he was in lawful

possession of tile subject matter (Leisa and Another v. Simon and Another

(2002) I Sri LR 148, at page 151),

DC KEGALLE FINAL J8191L DCF - 0243-99

'0

11421 Therefore, it is imperative in this case for the Plaintilr to prove that

the Plaintiff is the owner of lots I and 3 in Plain No. K 2469 and when the

Plaintiff fails to prove her title as pleaded, the Defendant~ are under no

obligation to prove anything in such an action. The Plaintiff has

overlooked tile tact that whatever may be the demerit~ of the De!endant~'

case and even if tile De!endants' case is demonstrably false, the onus was

on the Plaintitf to prove that she has title to lots 1 and 3 in Plan No. K

24m marked 'X'.

11431 If the Plaintitf fails to discharge the burden of proof as expected of

her, her action tails and she cannot ask for a declaration of title and

ejectment in her favour merely on tile stren/,>th that the Delendants' title is

poor or not established or that the Defendants failed to prove tllat they

were in lawful possession of the sul~iect matter.

11441 The Plaintiff has tailed to prove her title to lots I and 3 in Plan No.

K 2469 (lots 2 and !i in Plan No. 1176) and the learned Additional District

Judge has given cogent reasons for her conclusions and dismissal of tile

Plaintill's action for the tailure of the Plaintiff to prove her title to lots 1

and 3 in Plain No. K 2469. The Plaintiff cannot rely on the weaknesses of

the Delendants' case and the wrong findings of the learned Additional

DistTictjudge in respect of the De!endants' issues No.9, 10, II, 12 and 13,

to establish her own title pleaded and relied on by her in her pleadings.

Hence, the Plaintiffs a('tion tails as correctly concluded by the learned

Additional District,} udge.

Conclusion

11451 For those reasons, I hold that the conclusion reached by the learned

Additional District Judge in dismissing the Plaintill's action on tile basis

I)C KEGALLE FINAL 3819/1. I)CF - 0243-99

that the Plaintiff has failed to establish title to lots I and 3 in Plan No. K

2469 (tot 2 and 5 in Plan No. 1176) is correct. Subject t~ valiation witll

regard to the answers to Defendants' issues Nos. 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13, the

judgment of tlle learned Additional OistrictJudge of Kegalle is affirmed.

11461 Subject to the above-mentioned variation, the Appeal filed by tlle

Plaintifl is dismissed with costs.
