The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari quashing the entire proceedings of the disciplinary

inquiry (P15) conducted against the Petitioner by the 12th Respondent on the direction ofthe 11th

Respondent based on the Disciplinary Code. The Petitioner claims that this Disciplinary Code was

not in force as it was not made in accordance with the provisions of section 39 of the Pradeshiya

Sanwardana Bank Act No. 41 of 2008 as amended (Act).

The Petitioner was working as the 2nd Officer of Walagedara branch of the 1st Respondent Bank.

She contends that there were some financial irregularities at the said branch and she informed

about these irregularities to the Chief Internal Auditor of the 1st Respondent Bank. She further

states that due to the said act, the Manager and several other officers of Walagedara branch

made false complaints against her to the higher authorities of the 1st Respondent Bank.

As a result, the Petitioner was transferred to Matugama branch. Initially, an internal inquiry was

conducted and statements were recorded from the Petitioner. By letter dated 04.03.2013 (P9),

her services were suspended without salary in terms of Part 16 of the Disciplinary Code of the 1st

Respondent Bank.

Charge sheet dated 03.05.2013 (Pl1) was issued against the Petitioner by the 1st Respondent

Bank. The Petitioner took up a preliminary objection regarding the maintainability of the said

charge sheet on the basis that it was contrary to the provisions of section 39 of the Act.

The 12th Respondent conducted the disciplinary inquiry and found Petitioner gUilty of all charges.

The disciplinary order was communicated to the Petitioner by 'P16'. The Petitioner was reinstated

in service subject to several punishments including withholding of promotions for 5 years and

withholding of salary increments for 2 years.

The Petitioner seeks to impugn 'P15' and 'P16' on the ground that the disciplinary inquiry was

conducted in terms of the Disciplinary Code of the 1st Respondent Bank, which is not made in

conformity with section 39 of the Act and therefore is illegal, contrary to law and has no force or

avail before law.

Article 1.5 of the Disciplinary Code ofthe 1st Respondent Bank reads-

"2008 qo!!:iJ 41 t;d& gJ@y'cfJCj c"oD~fJ2f) ~l0!1/} o2f)@d 09 Dl D(fJdtfiCj g!!:iJJd gJ@y'cfJCj

Accordingly, it is clear that the Disciplinary Code of the 1st Respondent Bank was not made in

terms of section 39 of the Act as contended by the Petitioner but was issued by the General

Manager in terms of section 28 of the Act and approved by the Board of Directors in terms of

section 9 of the Act.

Section 28 of the Act reads -

"(1) The General Manager shall issue guidelines in respect of age of retirement, disciplinary

control and any other matter as may be necessary for the proper administration of the

affairs of the Bank.

(2) The employees of the Bank shall comply with such directions. "

It is clear from by the wording of section 28 of the Act, that the power to issue guidelines in

respect of disciplinary control of the employees of the 1st Respondent Bank is a matter for the

General Manager.

Section 39 of the Act reads -

"(1) The Board may make rules in respect af all ar any matter far which rules are required

ar authorized to be made under this Act or any other matter necessary to enable the Bank

to effectively carry out and perform its powers and. duties under this Act.

(2) Every rule made by the Board shall be published in the gozette and shall come into

operation on the date of the publication or on such later date as may be specified in the

rules."

In terms of sub-section (1), the Board can make rules in two situations. Firstly, where it is required

or authorized to be made by the Act. Secondly, where it is necessary to enable the Bank to

effectively carry out and perform its powers and. duties under this Act. However, neither of these

situations are engaged in this case since section 28 of the Act specifically provides for the making

of guidelines in respect of disciplinary control.

The Petitioner contended that the Disciplinary Code does not come within the scope of

"guidelines" but within the ambit of "rules" since it controls the employment conditions such as

disciplinary proceedings, suspension of service, issuing of charge sheets and punishments to be

imposed.

Black's Law Dictionary, 9th Ed. at 1446 defines "rule" as follows-

"Generally, an established and authoritative standord or principle; a generol norm

mandating or guiding conduct or action in a given type of situation."

Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, 7th Ed. at 690 defines "guidelines" as follows-

"A set of rules or instructions that are given by an official organization telling you how to

do something, especially something difficult. "

Since "guidelines" can be defined as "a set of rules", I hold that the use of the word "rules" in

section 39 of the Act and the use of the word "guidelines" in section 28 of the Act is not decisive

in determining the validity of the Disciplinary Code of the 1't Respondent Bank.

It is trite law that for the purposes of interpretation of two provisions in apparent conflict, the

general provisions must yield to the special ones [Seward v. The Vera Cruz (1884) 10 AC 59, Naresh

Chandra Das and Another. v. Emperor AIR (1942) Cal 593, Rajiyoh and Another v. Aboobakker and

Others (1978-1979) 2 Sri.L.R. 131, Ghouse v. Ghouse (1988) 1 Sri.L.R. 25, Calistus Perera v.

Nawange (1994) 3 Sri.L.R. 305, Paul Coir (Private) Ltd v. Waas (2002) 1 Sri.L.R. 13]. This principle

is expressed by the Latin maxim generalia specialibus non derogant.

To explain this rule, it would be apt to quote the following passage from Craies on 0 Statute Law,

5th Ed. at page 205-

"The rule is, that whenever there is a particular enactment and a general enactment in the

same statute, and the latter, taken in its most comprehensive sense, would overrule the

farmer, the particular enactment must be aperative and the general enactment must be

taken to affect only the other parts of the statute to which it may properly apply."

In view of the above, I hold that section 28 of the Act overrules section 39 of the Act when it

comes to the disciplinary control of the employees of the 1st Respondent Bank. As section 28 of

the Act does not require the guidelines issued by the General Manager with regard to the

disciplinary control to be published in the gazette to come in to force, I hold that the said

Disciplinary Code is in force for all purposes in connection with or arising out of the disciplinary

control of the employees of the 1st Respondent Bank.

For all the foregoing reasons, I dismiss this application without costs.
