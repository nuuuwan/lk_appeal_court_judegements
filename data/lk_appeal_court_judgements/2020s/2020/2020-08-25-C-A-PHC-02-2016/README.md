The accused petitioner H.S.P Kumara Karunarathne has

preferred this Appeal seeking to set aside the orders dated 7.1.2016

and 15.09.2014 of the High Court of Kurunegala and the Magistrate's

Court of Polgahawela respectively.

Despite the several notices issued by this Court on the appellant

and his registered Attorney, neither the appellant nor his Attorney has

been present in court on several dates and on 2.3.2020 when the

matter was listed for argument, it was decided to deliver Judgment on

the available material. Only the counsel for the respondent has

submitted the written submissions although both parties were invited

to file same.

Briefly, the facts relevant to this application are as follows;

The appellant was charged in the Magistrate's Court of

Polagahawela for having committed an offence under the Motor Traffic

Act No 14 of 1951 as amended by Act No 31 of !979 , for driving a

three wheeler and transporting passengers for a fee or reward after

consuming liquor, an offence punishable under section 214 (1) A read

with section 151 (l)A and section 216 (A) of the Motor Traffic Act as

amended and the Enhancement of Fines Act No 12 of 2005.

The appellant has pleaded guilty to the charge and the learned

Magistrate has convicted him for the offence and imposed a sentence

of 6 months rigorous imprisonment suspended for 5 years, a fine of Rs

i 4 I I I I I 1 ______ ----------------------------------------------- ___________________________________________________________ _

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------j

I I I I I I I I I 7500/- and if defaulted, 3 months simple imprisonment, and the !

I I cancellation of the driver's license bearing No 2542639. I

In the petition of appeal, among several reasons pleaded, the

following are submitted to establish why he is aggrieved by the

sentence imposed on him. Firstly, that he was not served with a

Charge Sheet; that he was not explained the consequences of pleading

guilty to a charge of this nature by his attorney nor by Court; that he

was informed by his Attorney that only a fine of Rs 5000/=

approximately will be imposed and a suspension of the driving license

for a maximum period of 6 months, therefore, he never expected the

driving license to be cancelled, as his livelihood depended on it.

It is admitted that he did not lodge an appeal, the reason being

him not realizing the consequences of the judgment until his driving

license was cancelled, at which point he has preferred a Revision

Application to the High Court of Kurunegala. The Revision application,

has been confined only to the order of cancellation of the driving

license.

At the High Court of Kurunegala, after hearing both parties the

learned judge has dismissed the application on the failure of the

appellant to establish exceptional Circumstances to invoke the

revlslOnary jurisdiction of Court, and also on the basis that the

application cannot be considered under section 13 of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

1 ______ ----------------------------------------------- ___________________________________________________________ _

Aggrieved by that order, the appellant has preferred this Appeal.

Some of the grounds of appeal urged In paragraph 12 of the

petition, can be summarized as follows; that the sentence imposed is

excessive; failure of the learned magistrate to consider that the

appellant was not convicted after a summary trial and therefore, the

imposition of the maximum sentence is unfair and unreasonable; the

learned judges' have erred in law when deciding that they are bound

by statute and thus there is no judicial discretion to impose a lesser

sentence provided by statute; the learned judges' have failed to

consider the mitigatory circumstances of the appellant prior to the

cancellation of the drivers license, which is a grave miscarriage of

justice.

It is observed that the appellant being represented by an

Attorney at law in the Magistrate's Court of Polgahawela has

unconditionally pleaded guilty to the charges against him and on that

plea, convicted for the offence he was charged with. The sentence

imposed by the learned Magistrate is in accordance with the penalty

set out in section 216 A of the Motor Traffic Act as amended.

Section 216 A provides

"Any person who is guilty of the offence of contravening

the provisions of sub section (la) of section 151 shall, on

conviction after summary trial before a Magistrate, be

liable to a fine not less than four thousand rupees and not

exceeding seven thousand five hundred rupees and to

, , , , , , , , , ,

, , , imprisonment of either description for a term not i

exceeding six months and to the cancellation of his driving

license".

In terms of the above section the maximum term of

imprisonment is a term of 6 months. In the instant matter the 6

month imprisonment that has been imposed has been suspended for 5

years by the learned Magistrate. Therefore, although the maximum

sentence was imposed on him it has been suspended. The reason may

have been that the appellant pleading guilty in the first instance and

the fact that he was not found guilty after a summary trial.

In the petition of the Revision application the petitioner has

admitted to have consumed liquor at a wedding ceremony on the day

of the incident. He has also admitted transporting his relatives in his

three-wheeler but denied it was on a hire. Admittedly he has pleaded

to the charges unconditionally. In such circumstances, there is no

discretion for the Magistrate to impose a lesser sentence than what is

provided for by statute.

It is also noted that the appellant, after lodging the appeal has

not submitted the written suhmissions and has not shown any

diligence in proceeding with the appeal.

In the circumstances, we see no exceptional circumstances

pleaded before the High Court of Kunmegala which shocks the

conscience of Court and as the sentence imposed is in accordance

with the law, we see no reason to interfere with the order of the High
