Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner is a trustee of a charitable organisation known as the Somawathie

Saparamadu Trust or Somawathie House. The said Trust had been established

under and in terms of an Indenture of Trust No. 344 dated 13th November 1997,

which had subsequently been amended by Trust Deed No. 359 dated 5th November

2014.

The Petitioner states that the main objective of the said Trust was to manage and

administer a home for orphaned children situated at Habaraduwa, on a land donated

by S.S. Saparamadu, who is the father of the Petitioner and the 10th Respondent. The

said home is registered with the Department of Probation and Child Care Services,

Southern Province. According to the Petitioner, the Home presently has 125 children

ranging from the ages of 3 to 18 who are provided inter alia with free medical and

dental care, education etc. In 2005, the said Trust had entered into an agreement

marked P2 with the 8th and 9th Respondents and with a foundation based in

Netherlands, in terms of which the Trust received funding to carry out the affairs of

the Home.

The Petitioner claims that the affairs of the Trust are governed in a transparent

manner, with the financial affairs of the Trust being audited by a reputed firm of

Chartered Accountants.

The Petitioner states that disputes relating to the manner in which the Home and the

Trust were being operated had arisen between the Petitioner on the one hand, and

his three siblings, including his brother, the 10th Respondent, and their mother, on

the other. This had resulted in action being filed in terms of the Companies Act No. 7

of 2007 in the Commercial High Court against two companies owned by the

Petitioner, namely Tisara Investments (Private) Limited, and Desano Investments

(Private) Limited.1 Although several interim orders had been issued ex-parte against

the said companies, the said Orders had subsequently been vacated, and the said

cases are pending before the Commercial High Court.

1 Vide the petitions filed in Commercial High Court Case Nos. 24/2014/CO and 26/2014/CO, marked P9a and P9b.

The Petitioner states that the 10th Respondent had made a complaint to the Criminal

Investigations Department (CID) against the Petitioner, which had resulted in a B

report being filed in the Magistrates Court of Nugegoda. This Court has examined

the said report, annexed to the petition marked P10 and observes that the

complaint relates to the following three matters:

(a) Depositing a sum of Rs. 14,725,899.75 belonging to the Trust in Deshan

Investments Private Limited owned by the Petitioner.

(b) Misappropriating a sum of Rs. 17,964,899.61 belonging to the Trust by

presenting forged receipts.

(c) Using a generator valued at Rs. 15 million received by the Trust for the

purposes of Thisara Investments owned by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner states that no adverse orders have been made against the Petitioner

in the said case, and that the CID has referred the matter to the Hon. Attorney

General for legal advice, which advice is pending. In fact, the Honourable Magistrate,

by an Order dated 12th August 2016 has held as follows:

The Petitioner states that the 10th Respondent and their mother had filed a private

plaint in the Magistrates Court, Galle against the Petitioner, his wife and a relative,

who had functioned as a trustee of the said Trust. The Petitioner states further that

the subject matter of the reports filed in the Magistrates Court of Nugegoda and

Galle are almost identical. This Court has examined the charge sheet filed in the

latter case, annexed to P14 and observes that the allegation against the Petitioner

is that he and the other persons mentioned earlier had caused criminal breach of

trust or in the alternative, misappropriated property belonging to the said Trust. The

charges do not refer to any specific incidents. The 10th Respondent has however

submitted that this case has since been withdrawn, owing to the death of the mother

of the Petitioner and the 10th Respondent.

5

It is not in dispute that the said Trust has been registered as a Voluntary Social

Service Organisation / non-governmental organisation under and in terms of the

Voluntary Social Service Organisations (Registration and Supervision) Act No. 31 of

1980, as amended (the Act),2 and that the provisions of the Act would apply to the

activities and affairs of the said Trust.

According to its preamble, the objective of the Act is to provide for the registration

with the Government of voluntary social service organizations, to provide for their

inspection and supervision; to facilitate the co-ordination of the activities of such

organizations; to give governmental recognition to such organizations which are

properly constituted; to enforce the accountability of such organizations in respect of

financial and policy management under the existing rules of such organizations, ... to

prevent malpractices by persons purporting to be such organisations...

Section 9 of the Act provides as follows:

The Registrar or any officer authorized by him in writing in that behalf shall

have the power-

(a) to enter and inspect at all reasonable hours of the day, the premises of a

voluntary organisation registered under this Act for the purpose of

ascertaining whether satisfactory standards of service are maintained in

such organisation;

(b) to bring to the notice of the Minister any allegation of fraud or

misappropriation of funds committed by such organisation ;

(c) to attend any meeting of the executive committee of such organisation or

a general meeting of the members of such organisation, upon the written

request of all or a majority of the members of the executive committee of

such organisation, or with the concurrence of the office bearers of such

organisation or the Minister. The Registrar or the officer so attending shall

not have the right to vote at such meeting..

2 Vide Certificate of Registration marked P5.

6

Provision to investigate allegations of fraud or misappropriation by an organisation

registered under the Act is provided under Sections 10, 11, 12 and 13 of the Act,

which are re-produced below:

Section 10

Where, in respect of a voluntary organisation registered under this Act, any

allegation of fraud, or misappropriation is made by any person, the Minister

may refer such matter to a Board of Inquiry.

Section 11

(1) The Minister may appoint a Panel consisting of six persons of standing

who are not public officers.

(2) The Minister may, for the purposes of this Act, constitute a Board of

Inquiry or Boards of Inquiry, each consisting of three members chosen from

the Panel. The Minister may nominate one member to be the Chairman of

a Board of Inquiry.

(3) ....

Section 12 -

(1) Where a matter is referred to a Board of Inquiry under Section 10, such

Board shall inquire and report on such matter to the Minister.

(2) The procedure for the hearing and disposal of any matter referred to such

Board shall be in accordance with the regulations made in that behalf.

(3) Such Board shall submit the report on its findings to the Minister within

fourteen days after the conclusion of the inquiry.

Section 13

For the purpose of an inquiry under Section 12, a Board of Inquiry shall have

the power:

7

(a) to summon and compel the attendance of witnesses;

(b) to compel the production of documents

(c) to administer any oath or affirmation to any person.

The powers of the Minister, on receipt of the report of the Board of Inquiry are set

out in Section 14 and reads as follows:

Section 14

Upon the receipt of the report of the Board of Inquiry in terms of section 12 (3),

the Minister shall refer such report to the appropriate authority for steps to be

taken according to law.

The Voluntary Social Service Organisations (Registration and Supervision)

(Amendment Act), No. 8 of 1998 introduced Section 14A, which is reproduced below:

Notwithstanding the provisions contained in section 14, where a Board of

Inquiry constituted under section 11 reports to the Minister that there is

evidence to support any allegation of fraud or misappropriation made against a

voluntary organisation and the Minister is satisfied that the fraud or

misappropriation is of such nature as would affect the financial management

of the organisation and that public interest will suffer if such organisation is

continued to be carried on by its existing executive committee, he shall, by

Order published in the Gazette, appoint an Interim Board of Management for

the purpose of administering the affairs of such voluntary organisation.

The Petitioner states that he received a letter dated 9th November 2015, marked

P12a, from the Secretary of the Board of Inquiry informing him that a Board of

Inquiry consisting of three members has been appointed by the Minister to inquire

into a complaint relating to the Somawathie Home, and requesting him to be present

before the said Board on 16th November 2015 with the documents set out therein.

The Petitioner states that as one of the members of the Board of Inquiry is an

associate of the 10th Respondent, he had filed CA (Writ) Application 448/2015 on 13th

8

November 2015. This Court has examined the petition filed in that application

marked P13a and observes that the Petitioner had sought:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Minister to appoint a Board of

Inquiry to inquire into and report on the said Trust;

(b) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the appointment of the 5th respondent (who is the

11th Respondent to this application) as a member of the Board of Inquiry;

(c) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the proceedings of the inquiry conducted by the

Board of Inquiry; and

(d) A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision to summon the Petitioner for the

inquiry set out in P12a.

This Court also observes that in paragraph 22 of P13a, the Petitioner had stated

that, he has reliably learned that the said purported inquiry had already commenced

and certain parties including the 14th Respondent had given evidence and/or

statements therein.

This Court had issued an interim order on 16th November 2015 suspending the

inquiry referred to in P12a from proceeding. However, on 24th May 2016, the

parties had agreed as follows3:

This matter is coming up today to inquire into the extension of the stay order.

At this stage, the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General who is appearing for

the 1st 3rd Respondents informs that under the law, there has to be an inquiry

held. However, the stay order issued by this Court had prevented any inquiry

being conducted by even a different panel. At this stage, parties agree to vary

the stay order preventing only the fourth, fifth, and sixth respondents from

conducting the inquiry. The Minister is free to appoint a fresh panel under the

provisions of the Voluntary Social Service Organisations (Registration and

Supervision), Act No. 31 of 1980 and to conduct the inquiry. Subject to the

above variation, the stay order issued by this Court will continue until the next

date.

3 Vide P13d.

9

The above application had subsequently been withdrawn by the Petitioner on 13th

June 2017 reserving the right to file a fresh application.

The 3rd 5th Respondents, who are members of the Panel appointed under the Act,

had thereafter been appointed by the Minister as members of the Board of Inquiry

to inquire and report into the complaint of the 10th Respondent.

The Petitioner states that he received the following letter dated 25th May 2017,

marked P16, from the 6th Respondent, Secretary of the Board of Inquiry.

By letter dated 6th June 2017, marked P16a, the Petitioner had sought time to

submit his explanation. By letter dated 19th June 2017 marked P18, the Petitioner

had written to the 6th Respondent requesting that the proposed inquiry be stayed

until the case in the Magistrates Court of Nugegoda is concluded. By letter dated

17th July 2017, marked P21, the Petitioner had inter alia responded to the matters

set out in the charge sheet marked P16.

By letter dated 22nd January 2018, marked P22, the 6th Respondent had directed the

Officer-in-Charge of the Somawathie Home to appear before the Board of Inquiry on

8th February 2018 together with the documents mentioned therein. It appears that

P22 has not been complied with, resulting in the Petitioner being required by letter

dated 5th June 2018 marked P24a to appear before the Board of Inquiry on 3rd July

2018.

The Petitioner has thereafter sought a postponement of the inquiry, which prompted

the 6th Respondent to call for further material by his letter dated 4th July 2018

marked P24e. The Petitioner does not appear to have responded to P24e, but had

instead filed this application on 11th July 2018 seeking inter alia the following relief:

1. A Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st Respondent to appoint a

Board of Inquiry under the provisions of the Act to inquire into the affairs of the

said Trust contained in P16.

2. A Writ of Certiorari quashing the appointment of the 3rd 5th Respondents as

members of the Panel of Inquiry to conduct an inquiry under the provisions of

the Act.

11

3. A Writ of Certiorari quashing the proceedings of the inquiry conducted by the

3rd 5th Respondents.

4. A Writ of Prohibition preventing the Respondents from conducting

and/continuing with the inquiry into the affairs of the Trust.

5. A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 3rd 5th Respondents from conducting

and/ or continuing with the inquiry into the affairs of the Trust.

This Court had issued ex-parte the interim order prayed for by the Petitioner

preventing the 3rd 5th Respondents from proceeding with the inquiry.

When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Petitioner informed this Court that he would not be challenging the appointment

of the 3rd 5th Respondents as members of the Board of Inquiry. The necessity for

this Court to consider the relief at paragraph (2) above therefore does not arise.4 The

learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner however submitted that proceeding

with the Inquiry is illegal on four principal grounds, which this Court shall now

proceed to consider.

The first argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that

once a matter has been referred to the Police or the CID, as the case may be, the

Minister cannot appoint a Board of Inquiry to inquire into the affairs of the Trust.

It is not in dispute that the 10th Respondent has complained to the CID relating to the

affairs of the Trust, and that the CID, having reported facts to the learned Magistrate,

has referred the matter to the Hon. Attorney General. It is also not in dispute that

the private plaint instituted in the Magistrates Court of Galle has been withdrawn

due to the death of the mother of the Petitioner and 10th Respondent. It is however

admitted that the Somawathie Trust is an organisation to which the provisions of the

Act would apply. This Court is of the view that once registration has been obtained in

terms of the said Act, the provisions of the said Act should apply to the Trust with full

force, notwithstanding an inquiry being conducted by the Police. The power of the

Minister to appoint a Board of Inquiry to inquire into the affairs of a body registered

4 Vide paragraph (d) of the prayer to the petition.

12

under the Act, is not conditional upon any other authority conducting an inquiry, and

therefore, this Court is of the view that the fact that the affairs of the Trust are being

investigated by the Police shall not be a bar to the Minister exercising the powers

conferred on him by the Act.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted further that in terms of

Section 14, what the Minister can do upon receipt of the report of the Board of

Inquiry is to refer such report to the appropriate authority for steps to be taken

according to law, which he submitted was a reference to the Police, and that as the

matter has already been referred to the Police, proceeding with the Inquiry would be

an exercise in vain. The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th

Respondents and the learned Counsel for the 10th Respondent however submitted

that referring a matter to the Police, once an inquiry has been concluded, is only one

of the steps that can be taken. The specific attention of this Court was drawn to the

provisions of the Trust Ordinance, which would be applicable to the Somawathie

Trust, and to Section 14A of the Act itself, which empowers the Minister to take

action set out therein, which is something that cannot be achieved through an

investigation by the Police.

Contrary to the position taken up on behalf of the Petitioner, this Court is of the view

that the failure by the Minister to appoint a Board of Inquiry when an allegation of

fraud, or misappropriation has been made, would be a dereliction of his statutory

duty, since he owes a public duty:

(a) to ensure that each organisation which has been conferred with governmental

recognition by virtue of being registered under the Act is held financially

accountable;

(b) to prevent malpractices that may take place at such organisation;

(c) to take action in terms of the Act when a complaint containing allegations of

fraud or mismanagement is made.

This Court therefore does not see any merit in the first argument of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner.

The second argument on behalf of the Petitioner is twofold.

13

The first is that a copy of the complaint made by the 10th Respondent has not been

made available to the Petitioner, thus depriving him and the Trust from presenting

their side of the story. The Petitioner has however admitted in paragraph 30 of the

petition that, by letter dated 17th July 2017 sent by their Attorneys-at-Law,5 the

Trustees of the Somawathie Trust comprehensively responded to and refuted the

purported charges made out in the letter marked P16 together with the necessary

documentation to substantiate their case, thus demonstrating that the Petitioner

and the Trust have not been prevented from defending their position, even though a

copy of the complaint had not been provided.

The second aspect of this argument is that the power to conduct an inquiry arises

only when an allegation of fraud or misappropriation is made, and in the absence of

the complaint being made available to the Petitioner, there is no material that

Section 10(1) has been triggered. It is not in dispute that the complaint made by the

10th Respondent has not been made available to the Petitioner, and that instead,

what was informed to the Petitioner by way of a Charge Sheet was only a synopsis of

the complaint.

In order to consider this aspect of the second argument of the Petitioner, this Court

directed the learned Deputy Solicitor General to file of record a copy of the said

complaint, which was duly complied with6. This Court has examined the said

complaint, and is satisfied that the matters set out in P16 are borne out by, and are

therefore based on the complaint of the 10th Respondent. Therefore, this Court does

not see any merit in the argument that there is no basis to trigger the provisions of

Section 10(1) of the Act.

Even though the non-availability of the complaint has not prejudiced the Petitioner in

the preparation of his response to P16, this Court is of the view that the Trust, as

well as the Petitioner are entitled to receive a copy of the complaint made by the

10th Respondent.

The third argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

proceedings before the Board of Inquiry are quasi-judicial in nature, and that even

though in terms of Section 41(2) of the Judicature Act, he has a right to legal

5 Vide P30. 6 Vide motion dated 21st July 2020.

14

representation, the Board of Inquiry, which comprises of two Attorneys-at-Law have

declined his request. The learned Counsel for the Respondents have however

submitted that the inquiry before the Board of Inquiry is only a fact finding exercise,

and that the necessity to provide legal representation does not arise.

This Court, having carefully considered:

(a) The nature of the allegations made in P16, and the response of the Petitioner

P21;

(b) The claim of the Petitioner that the accounts of the Trust have been audited by

a reputed firm of Chartered Accountants;

(c) The procedure that would be followed by the Board of Inquiry;7 and

(d) The nature of the action that could be taken by the Board of Inquiry at the

conclusion of the inquiry vide Section 12(1),

is satisfied that the Board of Inquiry is only engaged in a fact finding exercise, and

that the rights of the Petitioner would not be affected by the Petitioner not being

represented by an Attorney-at-Law.

The final argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is that his

participation before the Board of Inquiry would violate the principle of self

incrimination. This argument is founded upon Section 13 of the Act, in terms of

which the Board of Inquiry has the power to summon and compel the attendance of

witnesses, to compel the production of documents, and to administer an oath or

affirmation. Considering the fact that (a) the Petitioner is not an accused, (b) the

Board of Inquiry is only conducting a fact finding inquiry, (c) the Board of Inquiry is

only required to submit a report on its findings, this Court is of the view that the

question of self incrimination does not arise at this stage.

The learned Presidents Counsel drew the attention of this Court to an Order made

by the Commission of Inquiry inquiring into the issuance of Treasury Bonds where

the said Commission upheld the refusal to give evidence on the basis of the principle

7 Ibid.

15

of self incrimination. This Court must observe that in terms of Section 24 of the

Commissions of Inquiry Act No. 17 of 1948 (as amended), it is lawful for the Attorney

General to institute criminal proceedings based on material collected in the course of

an investigation or inquiry conducted by a Commission of Inquiry appointed under

the said Act. However, as pointed out by the learned Counsel for the Respondents,

the proceedings before a Board of Inquiry appointed under the Voluntary Social

Service Organisations Act does not entail the immediate invocation of the criminal

law and procedure, as any action pursuant to a reference in terms of Section 14

would have to be based on an investigation conducted by law enforcement agencies.

This is a fundamental difference between the regimes put in place by the

aforementioned Acts.

The Petitioner has also taken up the position in its written submissions that the

Respondents have not placed any material to demonstrate that the appointment of

the 3rd 5th Respondents as members of the Board of Inquiry has been made by the

Minister. While the 1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th Respondents, in their Statement of Objections

have confirmed that the appointment of the Board of Inquiry has been carried out in

conformity with the provisions of the Act, it must be noted that the necessity to

consider the said objection does not arise in view of the submission of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner that he is not challenging the appointment of

the 3rd 5th Respondents as members of the Board of Inquiry.

There are two matters that this Court wishes to advert to, prior to concluding.

The first is the fact that having obtained registration and Governmental sanction,

thereby giving legitimacy to the affairs of the Trust, the Petitioner cannot and should

not be allowed to prevent the Minister from initiating the processes that have been

introduced by the legislature for safeguarding the financial integrity of organisations

registered under the Act.

The second is the argument of the learned Counsel for the Respondents that this

application is an abuse of process, in that since 2015, the Petitioner has scuttled all

attempts to inquire into the affairs of the Trust, and that this has been done in spite

of agreeing before this Court in the previous Writ application that the inquiry shall

proceed. The learned Counsel for the Respondents drew the attention of this Court

to the sequence of events commencing from November 2015, which this Court has

16

already adverted to, in support of the said submission. While this Court does not

wish to engage on this issue, it is of the view that the Inquiry must be commenced as

soon as possible, and that the Board of Inquiry must conclude the Inquiry

expeditiously. This Court expects the Petitioner to co-operate in this regard, thus

establishing his bona fides, and the position that he has presented to this Court that

the complaint against the Trust has been actuated by malice borne towards him by

his siblings and especially the 10th Respondent.

In the above circumstances, this Court therefore directs the 6th and 7th Respondents

to make available to the Petitioner (a) a copy of the complaint made by the 10th

Respondent, and (b) a copy of the statements recorded so far, four weeks prior to

the recommencement of the inquiry. The Petitioner shall be entitled to submit a

consolidated response to P16, if any, within three weeks from the receipt of the

said documents. Upon recommencement of the inquiry, the Petitioner shall be

entitled to be present when statements are recorded under oath before the Board of

Inquiry.

Subject to the above, this Court does not see any legal basis to grant the Writs of

Certiorari and Prohibition prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed,

without costs.
