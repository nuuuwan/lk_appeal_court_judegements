Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this application was taken up for argument, together with CA (Writ)

Application No. 66/2013, the learned Counsel for the parties moved that this

Court pronounce its judgment on the written submissions that have been

tendered by all parties. On 28th February 2020, this Court, having examined the

record maintained by the 1st Respondent, the Consumer Affairs Authority (the

CAA/ 1st Respondent), directed the 1st Respondent to tender copies of

documents which have been referred to in the Journal Entry of that date. The

learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents thereafter moved that he be

permitted to make further oral submissions, which application was allowed by

3

this Court. Oral submissions were made by all learned Counsel on 6th March

2020.This Court has also had the benefit of receiving further written

submissions of the Petitioner and the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

The issue that arises for the determination of this Court is whether the

directive conveyed to the Petitioner by the 2nd Respondent, Chairman,

Consumer Affairs Authority, to pay the 3rd Respondent a sum of Rs. 158,769.13

as compensation, is illegal, and/or unreasonable, and/or is tainted with bias.

Introduction

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner is the registered sole authorised distributor in Sri Lanka for KIA

motor vehicles manufactured in South Korea. At the relevant time, the 3rd

Respondent was attached to the 1stRespondentand was holding the office of

Director (Compliance and Enforcement), and functioning as the Head of the

Legal Division of the 1st Respondent.

The proforma invoice

The 3rd Respondent was entitled to a permit issued by the Government of Sri

Lanka to import a motor vehicle under the preferential tariff scheme

introduced by the Government of Sri Lanka. While a vehicle sold by the

Petitioner to a walk-in-customer would normally have been imported directly

by the Petitioner, under and in terms of a letter of credit opened by it, the

system under the above Scheme was different, with the obligation to open the

letter of credit being with the permit holder, i.e. the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd

4

Respondent was therefore the applicant under the letter of credit annexed to

the petition marked P5, and the vehicle was consigned to the 3rd Respondent,

as borne out by the Bill of Lading annexed to the petition marked P8, and the

Customs Declaration annexed to the petition marked P10a.

The first step in importing a vehicle therefore was to obtain a proforma invoice

from the supplier of ones choice, and thereafter open the letter of credit,

either in favour of the manufacturer or the local agent. The 3rd Respondent had

accordingly obtained a proforma invoice from the Petitioner on 23rd July 2011,

a copy of which has been annexed to the petition marked P4.

The letter of credit

The letter of credit to import the motor vehicleP5, had been opened

thereafter directly by the 3rd Respondent on 26th July 2011, for a sum of USD

16556.P5 contains a seal of the Bank dated 28th July 2011 which indicates that

the letter was credit, although dated 26th July 2011 had been issued by the

Bank only on 28th July 2011.

Although P4 required the letter of credit to be valid for a period of six

months, the expiry date specified in P5 was 22nd January 2012. In terms of

P5, payment was to be effected by the Bank, after shipment, and on receipt

of documents in good order in Sri Lanka, with the exchange conversion rate

being calculated at the rate prevailing on the date payment was effected. As is

the case with all letters of credit, there is always the risk that the currency

conversion rate may fluctuate, either upward or downward, and it is therefore

the responsibility of the applicant, in this instance, the 3rd Respondent, to

5

safeguard her interests by fixing the conversion rate, or else, as what

happened in this application, take the risk by agreeing to pay at the rate that

prevails on the date of payment.

Extension of the letter of credit

By a letter dated 6th January 2012, annexed to the petition marked P6, the

Petitioner had informed the 3rd Respondent that our principals have informed

us that there is an unexpected delay in production due to the high demand for

KIA vehicles internationally, and as such the vehicle ordered will not be

delivered to you as expected in January 2012 and requested that the letter of

credit be extended by a further period of three months. The 3rd Respondent

had complied with the said request reluctantly, as borne out by her letter

dated 10th January 2012, marked R2.

Shipment and delivery of the vehicle to the 3rd Respondent

According to the Petitioner, and as evidenced by the Bill of Lading P8, the

vehicle had been shipped on 31st January 2012, and had arrived at the Port of

Colombo on 13th March 2012. After attending to the formalities at the Sri

Lanka Customs, the vehicle had been delivered to the 3rd Respondent on 27th

March 2012.

Complaint to the 1st Respondent

On 25th April 2012, the 3rd Respondent had lodged a complaint with the 1st

Respondent, a copy of which has been annexed to the petition marked P12.

In the said letter, the 3rd Respondent had stated that even though in terms of

6

the proforma invoice P4, the shipment of the vehicle was within 5-6 months

after receipt of the letter of credit, and after confirmation of production I

was verbally promised the delivery of the vehicle by end December 2011. The

3rd Respondents complaint was that arising from the delay in delivery, she had

suffered a monetary loss arising in the following manner:

a) The exchange rate that prevailed on 22nd January 2012 i.e. the last date

of the initial validity period of the letter of credit P5- was Rs. 113.76 per

USD. However, by the time the letter of credit was settled in end March,

the rate had gone up to Rs. 123.85, causing the 3rd Respondent a loss of

Rs. 166,939 on the settlement of the letter of credit, and a further loss of

Rs. 116,857 arising from the settlement of customs duty, calculated on

the value of the vehicle, at the conversion rate prevailing as at the date of

the customs declaration.

b) A sum of Rs. 95,000 being charges on vehicle rental for the period that the

3rd Respondent did not have a vehicle.

c) A sum of Rs. 2,379 being the expenses incurred as bank charges and

interest charges.

The essence of the complaint of the 3rd Respondent was that the Petitioner

had failed to provide her a service with due care and skill.

Section 32 of the CAA Act - Implied warranty

Section 32 (1) of the Act provides as follows:

In every contract for the supply of goods or for the provision of services

by any person in the course of a business of supply of such goods or

provision of such services to a consumer, there is an implied warranty

that

(a) the services will be provided with due care and skill;

(b) that any materials supplied in connection with provision of such

services will be reasonably fit for the purpose for which they are

supplied;

(c) the goods supplied or services provided will be in conformity with the

standards and specifications determined under section 12 of this Act;

and

(d) the goods supplied will be reasonably fit for the purpose for which

they are supplied.

Section 32 power of the CAA to conduct an inquiry into a complaint

In terms of Section 32(3), a consumer aggrieved by the breach of an implied

warranty as provided for in subsection (1) or (2) of Section 32, may make a

written complaint to the CAA. At an inquiry held into such complaint, the

Authority shall give the trader or other person against whom the complaint is

8

made, an opportunity of being heard either in person or by an agent on his

behalf.1

Section 32(5) of the Act provides as follows:

Where after the inquiry the Authority is of opinion that a breach of an

implied warranty has taken place, it shall order the trader or other person

to pay compensation to the aggrieved party or refund the amount paid for

the supply of such goods or provision of such services as the case may be,

and for the supply of any materials in connection with the provision of

those services, within such period as shall be specified in the order.

It is not in dispute that the CAA has not determined standards and

specifications in terms of Section 12, and that the provisions of Section 32(2)

do not apply to the present application. Bearing that in mind, Section 32 can be

summarised as follows with regard to the complaint of the 3rd Respondent:

a) The CAA has the power in terms of Section 32(4) to inquire into any

complaint made to it with regard to a breach of an implied warranty with

regard to services, provided such complaint comes within the provisions

of paragraph (a) of Section 32(1);

b) The person against whom such complaint has been made has a right to be

heard;

c) The CAA has the power to provide the relief set out in Section 32(5) if the

CAA is of the opinion that there has been a breach of the implied

warranty that the services will be provided with due care and skill.

1 Vide Section 32(4) of the CAA Act.

Inquiry into the complaint of the 3rd Respondent by the CAA

Upon receipt of the complaint of the 3rd Respondent, the CAA had called for

observations of the Petitioner. A preliminary discussion had thereafter been

held on 30th July 2012. An inquiry had subsequently been conducted on 16th

October 2012 and 4th December 2012 by an Inquiry Panel said to have

consisted of four members of the CAA, with the participation of the Petitioner

and the 3rd Respondent. After the inquiry, the said Panel is said to have made

the following order dated 14th December 2012, annexed to the petition

marked P15:

Dissatisfied by the above decision, the Petitioner filed this application, seeking

inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the order contained in P14;

(b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the purported findings of the Inquiry Panel

contained in P15.

The grounds of challenge of the Petitioner

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is seeking a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision conveyed by P14 and the findings of the

Inquiry Panel contained in P15, on the following three principle grounds:

11

1. The decision conveyed by P14 has not been taken by the CAA in terms of

the law, and is therefore illegal.

2. The members of the Inquiry Panel were biased in favour of the 3rd

Respondent;

3. The findings contained in P15 are unreasonable and irrational.

The first argument is the decision conveyed by P14, illegal?

The first argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was

that the decision conveyed by P14 has not been taken by the CAA in terms of

the law, and is therefore illegal.

The position of the 1st Respondent

In response, the 1st and 2nd Respondents, in their Statement of Objections have

explained the procedure that is generally followed by the CAA, as well as the

procedure that was followed with regard to the complaint of the 3rd

Respondent, in the following manner:

(a) Inquiries into complaints made in terms of Section 32 are conducted by a

duly constituted Panel of Inquiry consisting of four members of the CAA;2

(b) The inquiry into the complaint of the 3rd Respondent was conducted by

such a Panel;3

2 Vide paragraph 7(a). 3 Vide paragraph 21(a).

12

(c) P15 has been issued by an Inquiry Panel which consisted of four

members of the CAA;

(d) Orders of the Inquiry Panel are formally ratified by the Board of Directors

of the 1st Respondent prior to being communicated to the parties

concerned;4

(e) P15 has been ratified by the Board of Directors of the CAA at a meeting

held on 21st December 2012;5

(f) P15 is an Order of the 1st Respondent CAA.6

There is one matter that this Court wishes to note at this stage. Although the

quorum for any meeting of the CAA is four members,7 it was not the position

of the 1st and 2nd Respondents that the Inquiry Panel in fact acted as the CAA

and by virtue thereof, P15 would be a decision of the CAA. Such a position, if

taken, would not have been tenable for the reason that the inquiry on 16th

October 2012 consisted only of three members, and not four, as claimed by

the 1st Respondent.8

Thus, in summary, the position of the 1st and 2nd Respondents is that the

Inquiry Panel that inquired into the complaint of the 3rd Respondent consisted

of four members of the CAA, that P15 has been ratified by the CAA at its

4 Ibid. 5 Vide paragraph 21(c). 6 Vide paragraphs 9, 12, 13, 15. 7 Vide paragraph 8(2) of the Schedule to the Act. 8 Vide proceedings of the Inquiry Panel held on 16th October 2012, annexed to the motion filed by the 1st Respondent on 4th March 2020. See Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC vs. Consumer Affairs Authority and others [CA (Writ) Application No. 43/2016; CA Minutes of 22nd November 2019.]; Shell Gas Lanka Limited vs. Consumer Affairs Authority and Others [[2007] 2 Sri LR 212; judgment of Sripavan, J (as he then was) with Sisira De Abrew, J agreeing.]

13

meeting held on 21st December 2012, and therefore P15 is an Order of the

CAA.

In the written submissions of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, it has been

submitted that the Order made by the Inquiry Panel derives its legal validity

from the approval granted at the Board meeting of the 1st Respondent. In

paragraph 6 of the Written submissions of the 1st Respondent, it has been

stated emphatically that, Any order and/or decision primarily obtained by any

appointed committee or inquiry panel derives its validity and legal effect after

the final approval made by the full Board of the Authority at a meeting held by

summoning all the members of the Authority, in which the quorum of 4

members. Thus, there cannot be any ambiguity in the position of the CAA

before this Court that P15 must be approved by the CAA to have legal effect.9

Should the inquiry be conducted by the CAA itself?

Section 32(4) of the Act appears to suggest, on the face of it, that every

complaint must be inquired into by the CAA. This Court however observes that

Section 6 of the CAA Act provides that the Authority may, for the purpose of

discharging its functions, delegate to a public officer, such functions vested in

or imposed upon or assigned to the CAA. Furthermore, in terms of Section

8(n), the CAA may appoint any such committee or committees as may be

necessary to facilitate the discharge of the functions of the CAA.

It is therefore the view of this Court that an inquiry into a complaint made to

the CAA can be conducted:

9 Vide paragraph 11 of the written submissions dated 6th March 2020.

14

(a) by the CAA itself; or

(b) by a public officer to whom the function has been delegated in terms of

Section 6; or

(c) by a Committee appointed in terms of Section 8(n).

What is important however and this is the thrust of the first argument

advanced on behalf of the Petitioner - is that the decision, or in other words,

the opinion that must be formed in order to provide the relief set out in

Section 32(5), must be that of the CAA. Therefore, even if an inquiry into a

complaint is conducted by a committee appointed for that purpose, the

responsibility for taking the final decision or in other words, of forming an

opinion in terms of Section 32(5), will always rest with the CAA. This could be

achieved by (a) placing the report of the Inquiry Panel before the CAA, (b) by

the CAA deliberating on the findings of the said report, and (c) the CAA arriving

at a suitable decision, or in other words, forming an opinion, with reasons for

such decision or opinion being provided.

Thus, it is clear that the law does not provide for ratification of a decision or

findings of the inquiry panel by the CAA, nor does the law provide for the

approval of such decision or findings by the CAA. Mere ratification or approval

of such decision by the CAA, would be in derogation of the statutory function

that requires the CAA to form an opinion that a breach of an implied warranty

has taken place.

15

In Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth,10 under the sub-heading of

Power in the wrong hands, it has been stated as follows:

The proper authority may share its power with someone else, or may

allow someone else to dictate to it by declining to act without their

consent or by submitting to their wishes or instructions. The effect then is

that the discretion conferred by Parliament is exercised, at least in part, by

the wrong authority, and the resulting decision is ultra vires and void. So

strict are the courts in applying this principle that they condemn some

administrative arrangements which must seem quite natural and proper

to those who make them. In this class might be included the case of the

cinema licensing authority which, by requiring films to be approved by the

British Board of Film Censors, was held to have surrendered its power of

control11 and also the case of the Police Complaints Board, which acted as

if it were bound by a decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions when

only required to have regard to it.12

The legal position in this regard has been clearly laid down in R (National

Association of Health Stores) v. Department of Health13 where it was held as

follows:

It would be an embarrassment both for government and for the Courts if

we were to hold that a minister or a civil servant could lawfully take a

decision on a matter he or she knew nothing about because one or more

officials in the department knew all about it. The proposition becomes

10 H.W.R. Wade, C.F, Forsyth, Administrative Law [11th Edition, 2014] Oxford University Press; page 269. 11 Ellis v. Dubowski; [1921] 3 KB 621. 12 R v. Police Complaints Board ex p Madden; [1983] 1 WLR 447. 13 [2005] EWCA Civ. 154; per Sedley J.

16

worse, not better, when it is qualified, as Crane J qualified it and as Mr

Cavanagh now seeks to qualify it, by requiring that the civil servants with

the relevant knowledge must have taken part in briefing or advising the

minister. To do this is to substitute for the Carltona doctrine14 of ordered

devolution to appropriate civil servants of decision-making authority (to

adopt the lexicon used by Lord Griffiths in Oladehinde [1991] 1 AC 254)

either a de facto abdication by the lawful decision-maker in favour of his

or her adviser, or a division of labour in which the person with knowledge

decides nothing and the decision is taken by a person without knowledge.

In Shell Gas Lanka Limited vs. Consumer Affairs Authority and Others15 it was

held by this Court that, It is essential that for the lawful exercise of power, it

should be exercised by the 1st Respondent Authority upon whom such power is

conferred and by no one else. .... I am unable to agree with the learned Senior

State Counsel that the powers of the Authority can be delegated to the Pricing

Committee. The Pricing Committee may facilitate the discharge of the functions

of the Authority. But, the Pricing Committee has no jurisdiction to exercise the

powers of the Authority.

Did the Consumer Affairs Authority take the decision that was conveyed by

P14?

This Court shall now consider whether the decision conveyed by P14 has been

taken by the CAA in accordance with the obligation imposed on it by Section

14Carltona Ltd v Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All ER 560. Sedley J in R (National Association of Health Stores) v. Department of Health stated that Carltona, however, establishes only that the act of a duly authorised civil servant is in law the act of his or her minister. It does not decide or even suggest that what the civil servant knows is in law the minister's knowledge, regardless of whether the latter actually knows it. 15 Supra.

17

32(5) of the Act, or whether there has at least been a consideration of P15 at

the meeting held on 21st December 2012.

In doing so, this Court shall bear in mind the statement of Lord Diplock in

Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service16 [the GCHQ

case], where, having classified the three grounds upon which administrative

action is subject to judicial review, namely 'illegality', 'irrationality' and

'procedural impropriety', he proceeded to state that by 'illegality' as a ground

for judicial review I mean that the decision maker must understand correctly

the law that regulates his decision making power and must give effect to it.

According to the 1st Respondent, after the conclusion of the inquiry on 4th

December 2012, the next step that was taken was the preparation of a Board

Paper which the 1st Respondent has produced with its Statement of

Objections, marked R5 titled Summary of Orders issued by the Consumer

Affairs Authority.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner has pointed out two

important matters, which casts a serious doubt on the authenticity of R5, and

more importantly, the integrity of the procedure followed by the CAA. Having

drawn the attention of this Court to the same Board Paper that had been filed

by the 1st Respondent in CA (Writ) Application No. 66/2013 where the

Petitioner had challenged another decision contained in R5, he submitted

that even though both board papers contain the identical signatures on the

final page, the rest of the pages in R5 are different to the board paper filed in

CA (Writ) Application No. 66/2013. The second matter is that the Board paper

16 [1985] 1 AC 374.

18

R5 does not contain the board paper number, whereas the copy filed in CA

(Writ) Application No. 66/2013 contains a number. Regretfully, no explanation

was offered by the 1st Respondent as to how there can be two different

versions of the same Board Paper having the identical signatures. In the

absence of an explanation, the only conclusion that this Court can arrive at is

that there has been a serious irregularity in the preparation of the Board

Paper, R5.

This Court has examined R5, which is dated 14th December 2012 and observes

the following:

(a) The right corner column of R5 contains a summary of the order made in

11 inquiries conducted by the CAA;

(b) R5 has been prepared and submitted by the 3rd Respondent, Director

(Compliance and Enforcement);

(c) The decision pertaining to the 3rd Respondents complaint is contained in

R5 and is recorded as follows: The inquiry panel made an order against

the Respondent company to reimburse Rs. 158,769.13, 50% of the amount

incurred as additional charges by the complainant.;

(d) R5 has been recommended by the Director General; and

(e) The submission of R5 has been approved by the 2nd Respondent, the

Chairman of the CAA.

If, as the 1st Respondent claims, decisions of inquiry panels are placed before

the CAA for their ratification and approval, it would only be natural that such

19

decisions, or P15 in this case, be placed before the CAA. What is significant

however is that P15 has not been annexed to R5, nor does R5 contain the

factual matters relating to the complaint of the 3rd Respondent or the findings

of the Inquiry Panel on the said complaint. The 1st Respondent has not

produced any proof to demonstrate that the report of the Inquiry Panel P15

was in fact placed before the CAA, at its meeting held on 21st December 2012,

or that the CAA was apprised of the facts relating to the complaint of the 3rd

Respondent at the meeting. The only material placed before the CAA was that

the inquiry panel made an order against the Respondent company to reimburse

Rs. 158,769.13. The CAA has not been apprised as to how and why such an

Order has been made, and therefore the CAA could not have deliberated on

the facts and circumstances of the complaint and the relief that should be

allowed.

This Court is at a loss to understand how the decision in P14 could have been

taken by the CAA without having any idea as to what even the complaint is.

The position of the 1st Respondent that P15 was placed before the CAA at its

meeting held on 21st December 2012 therefore cannot be correct.

Given the fact that the Board paper R5 did not contain reasons as to why

relief should be afforded to the 3rd Respondent, and in the absence of any

evidence that P15 had been placed before the CAA, this Court can only come

to the conclusion that even if the CAA approved the Board Paper R5, it did so

in complete ignorance of the reasons that led the panel to conclude that the

3rd Respondent must be compensated by the Petitioner. In other words, the

CAA has not formed the opinion as required by Section 32(5).

20

The only material considered by the CAA in making the decision contained in

P14, that the 3rd Respondent should be compensated, was R5, which was

submitted by the 3rd Respondent. This fact is crucial in light of the second

argument of the Petitioner.

The above conclusions were in fact confirmed by the learned Counsel for the

1st Respondent, who, in the course of his oral submissions on 6th March 2020,

submitted as follows:

a) The summary of the findings of the Inquiry Panel are submitted to the

Legal Division, for the preparation of the report;

b) The Board paper relating to an inquiry is prepared by the Legal Division,

and it is the Board paper that is submitted to the CAA;

c) The report of the Inquiry Panel was not submitted to the CAA;

d) The CAA does not go into each and every detail of an inquiry, but takes

legal responsibility for its decision;

e) The report of the Inquiry Panel, once prepared by the Legal Division, is

sent to each member for their signature. However, he is not in a position

to tender a signed copy of P15.

This Court therefore has no hesitation in concluding that the decision

contained in P14 has not been taken by the CAA, and is therefore illegal.

21

Has P15 been signed by the members of the Inquiry Panel?

All three Respondents have categorically stated that P15 has been signed by

all four members of the Inquiry Panel.17 However, the report of the Inquiry

Panel submitted with the petition marked P15, which is the copy that had

been sent to the Petitioner annexed to P14, did not contain the signatures of

the members of the Inquiry Panel. But as the date of the report had been

inserted by hand, on P15, this Court called for the Inquiry File of the 1st

Respondent, which was made available to this Court by the learned Counsel for

the 1st and 2nd Respondents the same day. This Court, having examined same,

made several observations which contradict the position taken up by the 1st

Respondent in its Statement of Objections.

The first such observation is that the report of the Inquiry Panel that is

available in the official file of the 1st Respondent does not contain the

signatures of the members of the Inquiry Panel, although all Respondents had

emphatically stated that the members of the Inquiry Panel had signed P15,

nor does the said copy contain a date. This, together with the fact that P15

does not have the signatures of the four members of the Inquiry Panel

confirms that a signed copy thereof is not available, for the simple reason that

P15 was never signed. Thus, the averment in the Statement of Objections of

the Respondents, supported by affidavits, that P15 has been signed, is

incorrect.

17 Vide paragraphs 21(a) and 23 of the Statement of Objections of the 1st and 2nd Respondents; paragraph 21(b) of the Statement of Objections of the 3rd Respondent.

22

The 1st Respondent has suppressed the truth from this Court

The second observation that this Court made by examining the official file

maintained by the 1st Respondent is that only three members had participated

at the inquiry held on 16th October 2012, namely Mr. Milton Amerasinghe,

Major General N. Jayasuriya, and Mr. Varuna Alawwa, contrary to the

averment in the Statement of Objections that four members of the CAA sat at

the inquiry held on 16th October 2012. During the hearing held on 6th March

2020, the learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents submitted that even

though the 1st Respondent had appointed several panels consisting of four

members of the CAA to conduct inquiries, all four members of the inquiry

panel are not present at each and every session of an inquiry. To this Court,

such a course of action is unsatisfactory.

The third observation that this Court made was that on the file copy of P15,

an endorsement has been made on 2nd January 2013, to please resubmit with

the corrections. This endorsement confirms once and for all that P15 was not

placed before the CAA on 21st December 2012, and that the CAA rubber

stamped the Board Paper submitted by none other than the recipient of the

relief.

Conclusion

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the report of the

inquiry panel P15 was not placed before the CAA, and that the CAA did not

deliberate whether the Petitioner has breached the provisions of Section

32(1)(a). This Court is also of the view that the CAA has not formed an opinion

as required by Section 32(5) of the CAA Act that the relief afforded by P14

23

should be given, and that the CAA has merely rubber stamped the findings of

an inquiry panel and the recommendations contained in a Board Paper, which

is an abdication of the statutory power conferred on the CAA.

This Court is therefore in agreement with the first argument of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner that P14 is not a decision taken by the

CAA in terms of the law, and that the said decision is illegal.P14 is therefore

liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

The second argument was the CAA biased in favour of the 3rd Respondent?

The second argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was

that:

(a) The 1st Respondent inquiring into the complaint of one of its Senior

employees gives rise to a conflict of interest;

(b) The Inquiry Panel and the CAA were biased towards the 3rd Respondent.

Bias has been defined as an operative prejudice, whether conscious or

unconscious18 and a predisposition or prejudice against one partys case or

evidence on an issue, for reasons unconcerned with the merits of the issue.19

Rationale for the Rule against Bias

The rule against bias, that no one should be a judge in his own cause (nemo

judex in sua causa), should be held sacredit is not confined to a cause in

18 R v. Queens County Justices [1908] 1 I.R. 285 at 294; as referred to in De Smiths Judicial Review, ibid. 19 Flaherty v. National Greyhound Racing Club Limited [2005] EWCA Civ1117;as referred to in De Smiths Judicial Review, ibid.

24

which he is a party, but applies to a cause in which he has an interest.20 This

maxim lies at the heart of natural justice and fair procedure, along with its

counterpart audi alteram partem (hear the other side).

It is the view of this Court that what lies at the core of the rule against bias is

that the integrity, independence and fairness of the decision making process

must be protected and maintained at all times, thus ensuring public confidence

in the judicial and administrative decision making process.

As stated in De Smiths Judicial Review21,

Procedural fairness demands... that the decision maker should not be

biased or prejudiced in a way that precludes fair and genuine

consideration being given to the arguments advanced by the parties.

Although perfect objectivity may be an unrealizable objective, the rule

against bias thus aims at preventing a hearing from being a sham or a

ritual or a mere exercise in symbolic reassurance, due to the fact that

the decision maker was not in practice persuadable.

It is observed further as follows in De Smiths Judicial Review22,

In defining the scope of the rule against bias and its content, at least two

requirements of public law are in play. The first seeks accuracy in public

decision-making. If a person is influenced in a decision by his private

interests or personal predilections, he will not follow, or may be tempted

not to follow, the required standards and considerations which ought to

20 Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal (1852) 3 HLC 759 at 793; Lord Campbell. 21Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review [8th Edition, 2018] Sweet and Maxwell; page 535. 22Supra; page 536.

25

guide the decision. An accurate decision is more likely to be achieved by a

decision-maker who is in fact impartial or disinterested in the outcome of

the decision and who puts aside any personal prejudices. The second

requirement is for public confidence in the decision-making process.23

Even though the decision-maker may in fact be scrupulously impartial, the

appearance of bias can itself call into question the legitimacy of the courts

and other decision-making bodies.24

A different dimension of the rationale has been set out in the following

paragraph in Administrative Law by Timothy Endicott:25

A bias is a bad attitude. It is a disposition to make a decision against a

partys interest, regardless of how it ought to be decided... If the decision

maker has that sort of unfair attitude, no hearing can be fair. In fact, a

hearing is not really a hearing at all if the decision maker is going to

decide against you regardless of what he hears. The hearing becomes a

sham.

Test to determine Bias

It is well established that a pecuniary or proprietary interest in a matter would

automatically disqualify a decision-maker or judge from determining the

outcome of such matter on the ground that public confidence would inevitably

23Belilos v Switzerland (1998) 10 E.H.R.R. 466 at [67]. 24In this respect, it is important to emphasise that if the fair-minded and informed observer would conclude that there is a real possibility that the tribunal will be biased, the judge is automatically disqualified from hearing the case. The decision to recuse in those circumstances is not a discretionary case management decision reached by weighing various relevant factors in the balance. Considerations of inconvenience, cost and delay are irrelevant: Resolution Chemicals [2013] EWCA Civ 1515; [2014] 1 WLR 1943 at [35]. 25 Second Edition; 2011 page 153

26

be shaken if the decision were allowed to stand26 such cases clearly breach

the maxim that nobody may be a judge in his own cause27 and attract the full

force [of the requirement that] justice must not only be done but manifestly be

seen to be done.28

Where matters fall outside the scope of actual bias and the automatic

disqualification doctrine, Courts must determine whether the judges or

decision-makers interest in the matter is sufficient to justify disqualification.29

In doing so, Courts have applied several tests, ranging from the real likelihood

test, reasonable suspicion test, real danger test, and appears to have settled

with the reasonable apprehension test which is also known as the fair-minded

and well-informed observer test.

The distinction between the real likelihood test and the reasonable suspicion

test has been discussed in Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth30 as

follows:

In cases where there is no automatic disqualification it then has to be

determined whether the judges or decision-makers interest in the matter

is sufficient to justify disqualification. What is the test of apparent bias?

This question has a tangled history although the modern test is now

relatively clear. Much confusion has been caused in the past by the

concurrent use of differently formulated tests for disqualifying bias. In the

past many judges have laid down and applied a real likelihood formula,

26De Smiths Judicial Review (supra); page 546. 27Rand (1866) L.R. 1 Q.B. 230 at 232. 28R v Gough [1993] AC 646 at 661. 29Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth (supra); page 386. 30Ibid.

27

holding that the test for disqualification is whether the facts, as assessed

by the court, give rise to a real likelihood of bias;31 and this test has

naturally been emphasised in cases where the allegation of bias was far-

fetched.32 Other judges have employed a reasonable suspicion test,

emphasising that justice must be seen to be done, and that no person

should adjudicate in any way if it might reasonably be thought that he

ought not to act because of some personal interest.33

In Metropolitan Properties Co (F.G.C) Limited v. Lannon and others,34 which

has been widely cited by our Courts,35 Lord Denning M.R., whilst stating that

the real likelihood test is a matter on which the law is not altogether clear,

decided to stand by the rationale behind the reasonable suspicion test,

contained in the oft-repeated saying of Lord Hewart, C.J., in R. v. Sussex

Justices, Ex p. McCarthy36:

"It is not merely of some importance but is of fundamental importance

that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and

undoubtedly be seen to be done."

In R. v. Barnsley County Borough Licensing Justices, Ex p. Barnsley &

District Licensed Victuallers Association37 Devlin L.J., appears to have

limited that principle considerably, but I would stand by it. It brings home

31R v. Rand (1866) LR 1 QB 230; R v. Sunderland Justices (1901) 2 KB 357; Frome United Breweries Co v. Bath Justices [1926] AC 586. 32R v. Camborne Justices ex p. Pearce [1955] 1 QB 41. 33R v. Gaisford [1892] 1 QB 381; R v. Sussex Justices ex p McCarthy [1924] 1 KB 256; Cooper v. Wilson [1937] 2 KB 309. 34 [1968] 3 All E.R 304. 35 See Mohammed Mohideen Hassan vs. Peiris [1982] 1 Sri LR 195;Kumarasena v. Data Management Systems Ltd. [1987] 2 Sri LR 190; Captain Navarathne vs. Major General Sarath Fonseka [2009]1 Sri LR 190. 36[1924] 1 KB 256 at 259. 37[1960] 2 Q.B. 167 at 187.

28

this point; in considering whether there was a real likelihood of bias, the

court does not look at the mind of the justice himself or at the mind of the

chairman of the tribunal, or whoever it may be, who sits in a judicial

capacity. It does not look to see if there was a real likelihood that he

would, or did, in fact favour one side at the expense of the other. The

court looks at the impression which would be given to other people.

Even if he was as impartial as could be, nevertheless, if right-minded

persons would think that, in the circumstances, there was a real likelihood

of bias on his part, then he should not sit. And if he does sit, his decision

cannot stand.38

However, Lord Denning, causing some confusion, appears to have interwoven

the real likelihood test with the reasonable suspicion test, whilst reasserting

the rationale cited above:

Nevertheless, there must appear to be a real likelihood of bias. Surmise

or conjecture, is not enough39. There must be circumstances from which a

reasonable man would think it likely or probable that the justice, or

chairman, as the case may be, would, or did, favour one side unfairly at

the expense of the other. The court will not enquire whether he did, in

fact, favour one side unfairly. Suffice it that reasonable people might think

he did. The reason is plain enough. Justice must be rooted in confidence;

and confidence is destroyed when right-minded people go away

thinking: "The judge was biased".

38See The Queen v. Huggins (1895 1 Q.B. 563); Rex v. Sunderland Justices (1901 2 K.B. 373) by Lord Justice Vaughan Williams. 39See Regina v. Camborne Justices (1955 1 Q.3. 41) at pages 48 to 51; Regina v. Nailsworth (1953) 2 All ER 652.

29

Similar sentiments were expressed by this Court in Abdul Hasheeb v. Mendis

Perera and others40 where Justice G.P.S.De Silva (as he then was), having

discussed several English cases, held as follows:

even on the application of the test of reasonable suspicion, it must be

shown that the suspicion is based on reasonable grounds grounds

which would appeal to the reasonable, right thinking man. It can never

be based on conjecture or on flimsy, insubstantial grounds. Adopting the

words of Lord Denning in Lannon's case, Mr. Pullenayagam submitted that

"bias" in this context would mean, "a tendency to favour one side unfairly

at the expense of the other" -- a submission with which I agree.

In 1993, in R v. Gough,41 the House of Lords considered the various tests of

bias discussed above, in the context of an allegation of bias on the part of a

juror in a criminal trial, and ruled in favour of a real danger of bias test in

order to ensure that the court is thinking in terms of possibility rather than

probability of bias, and stated as follows:

Finally, for the avoidance of doubt, I prefer to state the test in terms of

real danger rather than real likelihood, to ensure that the court is thinking

in terms of possibility rather than probability of bias.

The Court in Gough thus rejected the notion that a matter must be viewed

through the eyes of a reasonable man because the court in cases such as these

personifies the reasonable man; and in any event the court has first to

ascertain the relevant circumstances from the available evidence, knowledge of

40 [1991] 1 SLR 243 at 257. 41Supra; at page 670.

30

which would not necessarily be available to an observer in court at the relevant

time.42

The above real danger of bias test was however subsequently revisited as it

introduced a discrepancy between the Convention (European Convention on

Human Rights) and the common law in ensuring impartial decision making.43

Further development came about in Porter v Magill,44 where the test was held

to be whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the

facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility of bias.45 The Porter

formulation, which was considered a modest adjustment to Gough, was

endorsed by the House of Lords in the subsequent case of Lawal v. Northern

Spirit Limited.46

The shift in perspective in Porter and Lawal were firmly based on the necessity

to ensure public confidence in the system of administration of justice. As the

House of Lords stated in Lawal:

Public perception of the possibility of unconscious bias is the key.

On the issue of what characteristics could be attributed to the fair-minded and

informed observer, the House of Lords in Lawal, held as follows:

It is unnecessary to delve into the characteristics to be attributed to the

fair-minded and informed observer. What can confidently be said is that

one is entitled to conclude that such an observer will adopt a balanced

42 Ibid. 43Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth (Supra) page 387. 44 [2001] UKHL 67. 45 Ibid. at 103. 46 [2003] UK HL 35.

31

approach. This idea was succinctly expressed in Johnson v Johnson (2000)

200 CLR 488, 509, at para 53, by Kirby J when he stated that "a

reasonable member of the public is neither complacent nor unduly

sensitive or suspicious".

In Helow v Home Secretary47, Lord Hope said this of the fair-minded and

informed observer:

She is the sort of person who takes the trouble to read the text of an

article as well as the headlines. She is able to put whatever she has read or

seen into its overall social, political or geographical context. She is fair-

minded, so she will appreciate that the context forms an important part of

the material which she must consider before passing judgment.

This Court is mindful of the fact that it is extremely difficult for a petitioner to

establish bias, and it is for this reason that the test of a real possibility that bias

might have affected the decision, viewed from the lens of a fair minded and

informed observer, has been advanced.

Therefore, the Petitioner does not need to submit proof that the relationship

between the 1st and 3rd Respondents affected the findings of the Inquiry Panel

or the CAA, or that the Inquiry Panel or the CAA were favourably disposed

towards the 3rd Respondent, or that the 3rd Respondent interfered with the

decision pertaining to her own complaint. In the absence of any material that

the 1st Respondent maintained a Chinese Wall between the 3rd Respondent on

the one hand and the Inquiry Panel and the CAA on the other with regard to

47 [2008] UKHL 62.

32

the complaint of the 3rd Respondent, even if the 1st Respondent and the

Inquiry Panel or the CAA were in fact scrupulously impartial, all that the

Petitioner had to establish was that the circumstances of this case are such

that it can lead the fair minded and well informed observer to conclude that

there was a real possibility of bias.

This Court must state that it does not wish to deny the 3rd Respondent the

right to make a complaint to the 1st Respondent, in her capacity as a consumer,

nor does it wish to deny the right of the 1st Respondent to inquire into such

complaint and make an order in terms of the law. However, it is an admitted

fact that the 3rd Respondent functions as the Head of the Legal Division of the

1st Respondent, who coordinates the matters with the Board of the 1st

Respondent in assisting them in her official capacity in the conduct of inquiries

in respect of the complaints made to the 1st Respondent by aggrieved

consumers.48 Hence, given the potential for the conflict of interest, either real

or apparent, and the allegations of bias that could be made, when an employer

entrusted with regulatory power inquires into a complaint made by an

employee against a third party, it was important that the 1st Respondent did

not involve the 3rd Respondent at all in its decision making process involving

the complaint of the 3rd Respondent.

As observed in De Smiths Judicial Review:49

Possibility of bias may arise from the fact that an adjudicator is the

employer or employee of one of the parties, if their relationship is a close

48 Vide paragraph 7(b) of the Statement of Objections of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, as well as that of the 3rd Respondent. 49Supra; page 564.

33

one or if their respective interests are directly involved in the subject

matter of the proceedings.

It was equally important that the 3rd Respondent, being a senior employee of

the 1st Respondent, recused herself from the said decision making process, and

stayed out of the loop, thereby allowing the 1st Respondent to have made an

order in terms of the law.

By January 2012, the 3rd Respondent was unhappy with the delay in the

delivery of her vehicle, as clearly expressed in her letter marked R2.50 It is the

view of this Court that the 3rd Respondent should have recused herself from

handling complaints against the Petitioner at that point, whereas it is now

admitted that the 3rd Respondent continued to handle ten other complaints

against the Petitioner.51 As the Director (Compliance and Enforcement), the 3rd

Respondent ought to have recused herself from any involvement in the

decision making process in all such inquiries, as well.

However, the evidence that was presented to this Court by the CAA itself is

entirely different.

This Court has already noted the submission of the learned Counsel for the 1st

Respondent that the Inquiry Panel did not prepare the report P15, but that

the findings of the Inquiry Panel were conveyed to the Legal Division of the

CAA, of which the 3rd Respondent was the Head, for the preparation of the

50 R2 annexed to the Statement of Objections of the 3rd Respondent. 51 Vide paragraph 8 of the Statement of Objections of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, that the complaint in CA(Writ) Application No. 66/2013 is one out of 10 numbers of similar types of complaints of consumers received by the 1st Respondent against the services provided by the Petitioner during the period of 2011/2012 for which the 3rd Respondent has carried out her official duties on behalf of the 1st Respondent.

34

report. It is the view of this Court that the independence that the Inquiry Panel

was required to maintain was shattered the moment the Legal Division was

entrusted with the task of preparing the report, and destroyed the integrity of

the inquiry process.

Preparation of the report by the Legal Division can give rise to two possible

scenarios. The first is that the report P15 containing the purported findings of

the Inquiry Panel and the recommendations of the relief that should be

provided to the 3rd Respondent has been prepared by the 3rd Respondent

herself. Giving the benefit of the doubt to the 3rd Respondent in this regard,

the next scenario is that the report P15 was prepared by the subordinates of

the 3rd Respondent, giving rise to an inference that the findings were prepared

to favour the 3rd Respondent.

The next step was to place the said findings before the CAA. The 1st

Respondent has produced, marked R5 a copy of the Board paper setting out

inter alia the summary of the Orders said to have been made by the CAA in 12

inquiries, including the inquiry relating to the complaint of the 3rd

Respondent. As noted earlier, R5 had been initiated by the Division of which

the 3rd Respondent was its Head, and submitted to the Board of the CAA under

the signature of the 3rd Respondent. The effect of R5 is that the 3rd

Respondent is recommending to the decision maker that relief be provided to

her, and what that relief should be.

The mockery does not end there. The 1st Respondent has produced marked

R6, an internal memorandum addressed to the 3rd Respondent, which reads

as follows:

35

Extract of the Board decision on the following Board paper as decided at

the meeting No. 12 of 2012 held on 21st December 2012 is sent along with

for necessary action and compliance, please.52

The effect of R6 is that the task of implementing the relief that the 3rd

Respondent is now entitled to, has been entrusted to the 3rd Respondent

herself.

Conclusion

This Court has already noted that the duty to arrive at an opinion in terms of

Section 32(5) rests with the CAA. It is the view of this Court that the objectivity

that the CAA is required to exercise when called upon to arrive at an opinion in

terms of Section 32(5), and the need for the CAA to strike a fair balance

between the rights of the parties in that process, cannot be objectively

expected in the light of the above facts and circumstances. The seriousness of

the allegation of bias is heightened when one takes into account the fact that,

in the absence of P15, the only material that was placed before the CAA in

relation to the complaint of the 3rd Respondent was the said Board paper R5,

submitted by the 3rd Respondent.

If the test in Porter is to be applied, the question, would a fair-minded and

informed observer, who considers the above facts, conclude that there was a

real possibility that P14 and P15 are tainted with bias, can be answered by

an overwhelming yes. This Court is of the view that public confidence in

administrative decisions would be shattered if decisions taken in light of the

52 The Board Paper referred to is R5.

36

facts and circumstances of this case, are allowed to stand. This Court therefore

has no hesitation in concluding that the findings contained in P15 as well as

P14 must be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

The final argument of the Petitioner is the decision that the Petitioner

breached the implied warranty unreasonable and/or irrational?

The necessity for this Court to consider the final argument of the Petitioner in

view of the findings of this Court in respect of the first two arguments does not

arise, as the said findings are sufficient to issue the Writs of Certiorari that has

been prayed for. However, for sake of completeness, and in order to

demonstrate through the findings in P15 the bias that was displayed in favour

of the 3rd Respondent, this Court will now consider the third ground that was

urged by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner, which is that the

decision of the inquiry panel to hold the Petitioner responsible for the delay in

shipment and delivery is unreasonable, and irrational.

Irrationality

The following passages from De Smiths Judicial Review capture the essence of

the above argument:53

A decision is irrational in the strict sense of that term if it is unreasoned; if

it is lacking ostensible logic or comprehensible justification. Instances of

irrational decisions include those made in arbitrary fashion, perhaps by

spinning a coin or consulting an astrologer54. In such cases claimant does

53 Supra; pages 604 and 613. 54 R v. Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner, Ex P. Moore [1965] 1 Q.B. 456 at 488 (Diplock LJ).

37

not have to prove that the decision was so bizarre that its author must

have been temporarily unhinged, but merely that the decision simply fails

to add up in which, in other words, there is an error of reasoning which

robs the decision of logic55.

Absurd or perverse decisions may be presumed to have been decided

in that fashion, as may decisions where the given reasons are simply

unintelligible. Less extreme examples of the irrational decision include

those in which there is an absence of logical connection between the

evidence and the ostensible reasons for the decision, where the reasons

display no adequate justification for the decision, or where there is

absence of evidence in support of the decision.

Our view is that a material mistake or disregard of a material fact in and

of itself renders a decision irrational or unreasonable. .... it should be

presumed that Parliament intended public authorities rationally to relate

the evidence and their reasoning to the decision which they are charged

with making. The taking into account of a mistaken fact can just as easily

be absorbed into a traditional legal ground of review by referring to the

taking into account of an irrelevant consideration; or the failure to provide

reasons that are adequate or intelligible, or the failure to base the decision

upon any or adequate evidence.

The test for deciding the reasonableness of a decision of a Public Authority

In considering whether the decision of the Inquiry Panel is reasonable, this

Court shall be mindful of the fact that it is not the duty of this Court acting in

55 R v. Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, Ex P. Balchin [1998] 1 P.L.R. 1.

38

the exercise of its Writ jurisdiction, to assess whether the implied warranty

was breached. The duty of this Court is thus to determine whether the CAA

paid due regard to relevant matters, in arriving at their purported decision, and

whether the findings of the inquiry panel are reasonable.

In exercising judicial review, Courts play a limited role and must be mindful not

to substitute its own decision for that of the public authority who has been

conferred with the power of making that decision, unless the authority has

disregarded material facts or where the decision is unsupported by substantial

evidence. In the words of Lord Bingham, they (judges) are auditors of legality;

no more, but no less.56

In deciding whether a decision is reasonable, the test to be applied is not what

a court of law thinks or considers is reasonable nor what the proverbial Man

on the Clapham Omnibus would consider reasonable. Instead, it is settled law

that in considering the validity of the exercise of discretionary power, the

Court will consider whether the power has been properly used, or whether the

authority has abused its discretion.

The test routinely applied for this purpose is the test set out in Associated

Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v. Wednesbury Corporation,57 where Lord

Greene defined unreasonableness as something so absurd that no sensible

person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority. The

famous example of the red-haired teacher who was dismissed due to the

colour of her hair, illustrates the high threshold for unreasonableness that

was expected to justify judicial intervention on this ground. 56 Tom Bingham, The Rule of Law [2011] Penguin Books at page 61. 57 [1948] 1 K.B. 223 at pages 229 - 230.

39

Subsequently, in Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil

Service58, Lord Diplock, having classified the three grounds on which

administrative action is subject to judicial control, crystallized irrationality as a

standalone ground for judicial review.59 The ground of irrationality however

was intrinsically linked to Wednesbury unreasonableness, and only applied to

a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral

standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to

be decided could have arrived at it, thus keeping the threshold for judicial

intervention still very high.60

A similar threshold was adopted by Lord Scarman who referred to a need to

demonstrate that the guidance of the Secretary of State in that case were so

absurd that he must have taken leave of his senses61, in order to justify judicial

intervention.

A common feature in the abovementioned cases is that for Courts to

intervene, the decision of the public authority in question must not just be

unreasonable, but manifestly unreasonable. There is however growing

precedence to show that English Courts have attempted to reduce the rigour

of Wednesbury unreasonableness over the years, particularly in light of the

Human Rights Act 1998 which incorporated the European Convention on

The case of Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside

Metropolitan Borough Council,63 decided prior to the GCHQ case provides for

what can be considered a more balanced test:

In public law, unreasonable as descriptive of the way in which a public

authority has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has

become a term of legal art. To fall within this expression it must be

conduct which no sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its

responsibilities would have decided to adopt.64

The role of this Court in exercising judicial review

Authorities acting on behalf of the public ought to be accountable for the

overall quality of the decision making process. While Courts must be mindful

not to substitute its own decision for that of the public authority, this must be

balanced with Courts taking an active role in probing the quality of decisions of

public authorities, and ensuring that actions of public authorities are properly

substantiated, justified, and strike a fair balance between parties. The

necessity for judicial intervention could not have been clearer than in this case,

where this Court has already seen the manner in which the 1st Respondent has

permitted its internal processes to be manipulated and distorted.

63 Supra; page 1064. 64 The test used in Tameside was cited with approval in the case of R v Chief Constable of Sussex (Ex parte International Traders Ferry Ltd) [[1999] 1 All ER 129 at page 157].

Failure to take into consideration relevant material

The final argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is

based on the premise that the Inquiry Panel failed to take into consideration

relevant factors, which resulted in its decision not being supported by the

material that was placed before the Inquiry Panel.

Failure to take into consideration relevant material or taking into consideration

irrelevant material can render a decision unreasonable. As stated in De Smiths

Judicial Review:65

If the exercise of a discretionary power has been influenced by

considerations that cannot lawfully be taken into account, or by the

disregard of relevant considerations required to be taken into account

(expressly or impliedly), a court will normally hold that the power has not

been validly exercised.

This Court has examined the report marked P15, and observes that the

findings contained therein have ignored the following three fundamentally

important facts:

(a) That the date of shipment was variable;

(b) That there is a difference between an undertaking to effect shipment by a

particular date as opposed to an undertaking to deliver by a particular

date;

65 Supra; at page 305.

42

(c) That the Petitioner cannot be held responsible for any delay that occurred

from the date of shipment, and until the arrival of the vehicle at the Port

of Colombo.

The task that was expected of the Inquiry Panel was to inquire and determine

whether the Petitioner has breached an implied warranty that it shall exercise

due care and skill in providing a service to the 3rd Respondent. Therefore, it

was important that the service was identified first. For this, the Inquiry Panel

and the CAA would have to go by the proforma invoice in order to determine

the terms and conditions subject to which the service was to be provided, and

thereafter determine whether there has been a breach of that service. To this

Court, the service that was to be provided by the Petitioner consisted of

placing the order with the manufacturer, effecting shipment of the vehicle,

clearing the vehicle on payment of charges, carrying out the pre-delivery

inspection, and complying with the warranty.

The date of shipment

The proforma invoice P4 contained the following conditions with regard to

shipment:

(a) Shipment shall be within 5-6 months after receipt of the letter of credit in

favour of the Petitioner;

(b) Shipment shall be after confirmation of production;

(c) The latest shipment date to be 5 months from the date of the letter of

credit.

43

On the face of it, there is a contradiction between the above three conditions,

as to when the shipment should be effected. Thus, according to P4:

(a) Shipment should be effected within five months from the date of the

opening of the Letter of Credit;

(b) Shipment should be effected prior to the expiry of six months from the

date of the letter of credit being opened.

(c) The shipment date shall be decided once the manufacturer confirms the

date of production.

It appears to this Court that the intention of the Petitioner was that shipment

shall take place during the validity period of the letter of credit, subject to

confirmation of the date of production from the manufacturer of the vehicle,

given the fact that the goods were being manufactured by its principal and not

by the Petitioner. It is significant that in her complaint marked P12, the 3rd

Respondent has admitted that, as per the proforma invoice, shipment of the

vehicle was within 5-6 months after receipt of LC in favour of KIA Motors

(Lanka) Limited, and after confirmation of production. While the shipment of

the vehicle cannot be delayed unreasonably, the date of shipment was not of

the essence of the contract.

As noted earlier, even though the letter of credit is dated 26th July 2011, it

appears from the date stamp of the Bank on P5 that it has been issued by the

Bank only on 28th July 2011. Thus, it would be safe to assume that in terms of

the proforma invoice P4, the Petitioner had time until 28th January 2012 to

effect shipment. This, taken with the condition in the proforma invoice that

44

shipment is subject to confirmation from the manufacturer of the date of

production, and the admission by the 3rd Respondent of this condition in P12,

means that there was no agreement on the exact date of shipment. P15,

however, has been prepared on the notion that the date of shipment was

agreed between the parties and that the Petitioner breached this condition,

although the material does not support such a conclusion

Effecting shipment as opposed to delivery

As observed earlier, one aspect of the service to be provided by the Petitioner

was to effect shipment, and not delivery, within the aforementioned time

period. The aspect of delivery was not subject to any conditions contained in

P4. The Petitioner had not specified to the 3rd Respondent a date of delivery

of the said vehicle in Sri Lanka, and therefore the Petitioner has not

undertaken to deliver the vehicle by a given date, although the 3rd Respondent

claims that a verbal assurance was given to that effect. The authors of P15

have ignored this distinction between the date of shipment and the date of

delivery of the vehicle to the 3rd Respondent, and have held that the Petitioner

is liable for the failure to deliver as agreed.

Can the Petitioner be held liable for delay that occurs after shipment?

The Petitioner has stated in paragraph 8 of the petition that shipment was

delayed beyond the agreed date due to production delays in Korea. In the

letter dated 6th January 2012 annexed to the petition marked P6, the

Petitioner has stated that the delay in production had arisen as a result of

there being a high demand for KIA vehicles internationally. This Court must

note that even if there was such a delay, this fact has not been supported by

45

any documentary proof. Furthermore, it appears to this Court that this issue

may not have arisen had the Petitioner obtained confirmed dates for shipment

from the manufacturer after the 3rd Respondent opened the letter of credit,

and thereafter informed the 3rd Respondent of the appropriate date of

shipment. Such a course of action would have been entirely within the

proforma invoice issued by the Petitioner, and the 3rd Respondent could not

have had any complaint, had the Petitioner done so.

According to the Petitioner, the vehicle had been shipped on 31st January 2012,

as evidenced by the bill of lading annexed to the petition marked P8, on

board MV Asian Grace. The Petitioner states further that although the vessel

arrived at the Port of Colombo, due to congestion at the Port of Colombo

caused by lack of storage yard space, the said vessel could not berth in

Colombo, and the vessel had been diverted to Oman, where the vehicles had

been unloaded. The vehicle of the 3rd Respondent, together with other vehicles

consigned to the Petitioner, was collected by another ship, MV Princess VII on

3rd March 2012. The latter vessel had arrived at the Port of Colombo on 13th

March 2012, the Customs Declaration had been filed on 16th March 2012 in the

name of the 3rd Respondent, the Customs duties had been paid on 26th March

2012, and the vehicle had been delivered to the 3rd Respondent on 27th March

2012.

Having shipped the vehicle, the next obligation of the Petitioner was to clear

the vehicle through Customs after its arrival at the Port of Colombo, carry out

the manufacturer recommended inspection at its workshop, and hand over the

vehicle to the 3rd Respondent. The above timeline does not therefore cover the

period between shipment and the arrival of the vehicle at the Port of Colombo,

46

with the question being whether the Petitioner can be held liable for any delay

caused during that period.

The Inquiry Panel had however held the Petitioner liable for the delay in

delivery arising from the inability of MV Asian Grace to call over at the Port of

Colombo, as evidenced from the following paragraph of P15:

fuysoS mrSlaIK uKaX,h j.W;a;rlrejkaf.a wjOdkhg fhduq lf,a wod,

fudagra r:h /f.k wd kej wdmiq hdu fya;=fjka isoqjq hus uQ,Huh mdXqjla fjs

meusKs,sldrshg wu;r jshoula oersug isoq jSu widOdrK nj;a,

In terms of the complaint made to the 1st Respondent, the task of the Inquiry

Panel was to ascertain if the Petitioner had breached the implied warranty to

provide their services with due skill and care. The scope of Section 32(1)(a)

thus would be to consider whether the Petitioner had failed to discharge a

responsibility that was within its control.

The Petitioner has annexed to the petition marked P9, a letter dated 15th

August 2012 issued by M/s Aitken Spence Shipping Limited. The said letter,

which had been attached to the letter dated 15th August 2012 annexed to the

petition marked P13(b) sent by the Petitioner to the Deputy Director (Legal

and Enforcement) of the CAA, reads as follows:

We wish to inform you that MV Asian Grace, scheduled to call at the Port

of Colombo on 19th February 2012, laden with 360 units of KIA motor

vehicles had omitted her Colombo call to avoid heavy berthing delays /

waiting time. From May 2011, the Colombo ports vehicle yard was

47

severely congested due to the increase of motor vehicle imports and as a

result all vehicle carriers had to wait at the anchorage until the imported

vehicles were cleared and the yard space is created to berth and

discharge the cargo. The average waiting time/berthing delay for a car

carrier was 7 days.

After omitting Colombo the 360 units of KIA motor vehicles were

discharged at the Port (of) Sultan Qaboos on 23rd February 2012 to be

subsequently transshipped to Colombo.

MV Princess VII which was the relief transshipment vessel, loaded the 360

units of KIA motor vehicles ex. Port Sultan Qaboos on 3rd March 2012 and

she arrived at the Port of Colombo on 13th March 2012. She was allocated

an on-arrival berth on the same day.

While P9 explains the delay for the delivery, no material has been filed by the

3rd Respondent to contradict the contents thereof. P9 therefore

demonstrates that the vehicle yard at the Port of Colombo did not have

sufficient capacity since May 2011 resulting in roll-on roll-off vessels not calling

at the Port of Colombo.

The uncontradicted evidence that was available to the Inquiry Panel, which the

Inquiry Panel failed to consider at all, is that the vessel that left South Korea

carrying the vehicle consigned to the 3rd Respondent, was scheduled to call in

Colombo on 19th February 2012, and did in fact call, but could not find berthing

due to the vehicle yard at the Colombo Port being congested. It was due to this

reason that MV Asian Grace left Colombo, causing a delay of almost 30 days

prior to the vehicle being brought to Colombo on board MV Princess II. The

48

fact that the Inquiry Panel did not consider P9 at all, inspite of the said letter

being made available to it by the Petitioner, is borne out by the following

paragraph of P15:

wod, fudagra r:h f.kajsug m%udo jSug ;j;a fya;=jla f,i fld<U jrdfha ;snq

;onoh fya;=fjka kej kex.=rus ,Eug fkdyels jSu nj j.W;a;rldr wdh;kh

m%ldYl< o tu lreKq ms<s.; yels idlaIs u.ska Tmamq lsrsug / ;yjqre lsrsug

j.W;a;rldr wdh;kh wfmdfydi;a jsu.

Even if the Petitioner had undertaken to deliver by 28th January 2012 as

opposed to effecting shipment by that date, it is the view of this Court that it

would be unreasonable to hold the Petitioner liable for delays that are totally

beyond the control of the Petitioner. Whatever skill and care that the

Petitioner could have exercised would not have cleared the congestion of

vehicles at the Port of Colombo.

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the findings in P15

are irrational and unreasonable, and glides with ease the high threshold set

out in Wednesbury as well as in the GCHQ case. This Court is therefore of the

view that P14 and P15 are liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari, on

this ground too.

Bias revisited

The failure to take into account material that was placed before the Inquiry

Panel, and to arrive at a conclusion which is not supported by any evidence

placed before the said Panel, gives the appearance that the decision was

driven by extraneous considerations.

49

This Court is of the view that notwithstanding the real possibility of bias that

has been established by the circumstances discussed under the second

argument of the Petitioner, the above findings of this Court on the third

argument of the Petitioner that the decision is unreasonable and irrational,

provide sufficient material for this Court too to apprehend that the decision of

the 1st Respondent is tainted with a real possibility of bias.

Conclusion

In the above circumstances, this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari quashing the

decision contained in P14 and a Writ of Certiorari quashing the findings

contained in P15. The 2nd Respondent had made certain amendments to P14

by letter dated 28th February 2013, annexed to the petition marked P16. In

view of the findings of this Court, P16 shall be of no force.

This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
