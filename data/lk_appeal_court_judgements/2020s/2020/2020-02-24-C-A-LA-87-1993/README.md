Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed with leave obtained by the Plaintiff against

the order of the learned District Judge of Gampaha delivered on

19.04.1993.1 By this order, the applications of the Defendant and

11 Applicants, made under section 282(2) of the Civil Procedure

Code, to have the sale conducted on 29.08.1991 by the Fiscal of

the District Court of Negombo in execution of an ex parte decree

was set aside.

Section 282(2) of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows:

The decree-holder, or any person whose immovable property

has been sold under this Chapter, or any person establishing

to the satisfaction of the court an interest in such property,

may apply by petition to the court to set aside the sale on the

ground of a material irregularity in publishing or conducting

it; but no sale shall be set aside on the ground of irregularity

1 Vide JE No.204 at page 132 of Vol. I of the Appeal Brief.

unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the court

that he has sustained substantial injury by reason of such

irregularity, and unless the grounds of the irregularity shall

have been notified to the court within thirty days of the

receipt of the Fiscals report.

In my view, there is a material irregularity which amounts to

illegality in this impugned sale.

Let me now explain.

The Plaintiff instituted action in the District Court of Gampaha

under summary procedure to recover from the Defendant a sum

of Rs. 600,000 given on a promissory note. The main case was

decided ex parte in favour of the Plaintiff on 29.01.1988.2 The

District Court ordered to issue a writ of execution of the decree on

05.02.1988.3 Upon the Defendant having made an application to

have the said ex parte decree vacated,4 the Court fixed the matter

for inquiry. Pending inquiry, the Court, on 07.08.1989, stayed

the sale of the property of the Defendant already fixed for

10.08.1989 in execution of the said decree.5 Thereafter, on

09.08.1989, the Court made another supplementary order that

the said stay of sale shall take effect only after the Defendant

deposited all Fiscals fees.6 This order was complied with. After

inquiry, the application to set aside the ex parte decree was

dismissed by the Court by order dated 02.08.1991.7 Thereupon,

on 07.08.1991, the Attorney-at-Law for the Plaintiff made an

application to Court to re-issue the writ, and the Court

accordingly issued the writ on 08.08.1991.8

The Defendant filed a Notice of Appeal on 09.08.1991 against the

order dated 02.08.1991.9

Thereafter, on 22.08.1991, the District Judge of Gampaha made

order staying the execution of the writ. In addition, the District

Judge stated that the Defendant shall deposit the expenses

incurred by the Negombo Fiscal in relation to the execution of the

writ. It must be emphatically emphasised that stay of writ was

not conditional on the Fiscals fees being deposited. In other

words, payment of the Fiscals fees was not a condition precedent

to the stay of the sale. Stay of the sale was a stand-alone order.

( .

. 10) This order for stay of the sale, made

in the presence of the Attorneys-at-Law for both parties,11 was

communicated to the Negombo Fiscal on 23.08.1991.12

However, the Negombo Fiscal had conducted the sale on

29.08.1991 and sold the properties seized to the Plaintiff on the

basis that the Fiscals fees were not paid.13 This in my view is a

clear misinterpretation of the Court order at the behest of the

Attorney-at-Law for the Plaintiff, who appears to have taken an

extraordinary personal interest in executing the writ despite stay.

In the newspaper advertisement, handbills, notices etc. in respect

of the sale held on 29.08.1991, the Negombo Fiscal had

mentioned the date of issuance as 05.08.1991.14 The position of

learned counsel for the Plaintiff is that the Plaintiff obtained a

certified copy of the order dated 02.08.1991 on 05.08.1991 and

handed it over to the Negombo Fiscal on the same day with the

aforesaid newspaper advertisement, handbills, notices etc., and

that the writ issued was not a new writ, but the old writ stayed

until the conclusion of the inquiry into the vacation of the ex

parte Judgment.15

This course of action followed by the Attorney-at-Law for the

Plaintiff is not permitted by law.

At 05.08.1991, there was no valid writ to be executed. The

original writ issued was stayed by order dated 07.08.1989.

In terms of section 337(3) of the Civil Procedure Code, a writ of

execution, if unexecuted, shall remain in force for one year only

from its issue. But it can be renewed for one year from time to

time before its expiration. Once expired, a fresh writ shall be

issued. According to section 337(1), subject to certain exceptions,

no application to execute a decree shall be granted after the

13 Vide Fiscals Report at page 218 of Vol. V of the Appeal Brief. 14 Vide pages 223-229 of Vol. V of the Appeal Brief. 15 Vide page 12 of the written submission of the Plaintiff dated 22.02.2012.

expiration of ten years from the date of the decree. Section 347

enacts that In cases where there is no respondent named in the

petition of application for execution, if more than one year has

elapsed between the date of the decree and the application for its

execution, the court shall cause the petition to be served on the

judgement-debtor, and shall proceed thereon as if he were

originally named respondent therein..

Therefore, in this instance, a fresh writ appears to have been

issued to the Negombo Fiscal only on 08.08.1991.16 Hence the

argument that there was a writ already issued by 05.08.1991 is

unsustainable.

In Victor de Silva v. Jinadasa de Silva (1964) 68 NLR 45, the Court

ordered the Fiscal to stay the sale of certain properties seized in

execution of a writ. The order was made because the judgment-

debtors had presented an application to the Supreme Court to set

aside in revision the decree in execution of which the writ had

been issued. Despite the order of the Court to stay execution,

and while the application in revision had been pending in the

Supreme Court, the Fiscal proceeded with the sale because the

Fiscals charges were not paid. The purchasers of some of the

properties seized were the judgment-creditors. After the

application in revision had been dismissed by the Supreme Court,

the judgment-debtors moved the District Court to set aside the

sale, and the District Court allowed the application.

On appeal inter alia it was contended that in terms of section 343

a sale could be stayed only on payment of Fiscal charges and

16 Vide JE 130 at page 83 of Vol. I of the Appeal Brief.

7

therefore the Fiscal was correct in proceeding with the sale, as

Fiscal charges were not remitted.

Section 343 of the Civil Procedure Code runs as follows:

343(1) The court may for sufficient cause stay execution

proceedings at any stage thereof, and make order for

adjournment of a sale.

(2) The application to court to stay proceedings shall be made

by petition, to which all persons interested in the matter of

the execution shall be made parties, and no such order shall

be made until after payment of all Fiscals fees then due.

Whilst rejecting the above argument and affirming the order of the

District Court, it was held on appeal that:

Where the Court orders the Fiscal to stay execution of a sale

under a writ, the Fiscal is bound to obey the order whether it

be right or wrong. The Fiscal is an officer of the Court. He

executes a writ on the authority of the Court and he is

subject to its direction and control at every stage of the

execution.

Raman Chetty v. Siriwardene (1925) 27 NLR 269 is a case where a

Fiscals sale was held after an order of the Court had been issued

staying the sale, because the order was not communicated to the

officer conducting the sale. The District Court set aside the sale.

On appeal, it was held that it was competent of the Court to set

aside the sale.

8

I think this is quite sufficient to declare that the sale conducted

on 29.08.1991 despite the stay was a nullity.

Hence there is no necessity to delve into the various grounds

upon which the appeal was argued before me.

I dismiss the appeal but without costs.
