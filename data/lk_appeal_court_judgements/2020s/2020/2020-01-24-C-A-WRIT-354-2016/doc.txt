Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner claims to be the owner of several lots of land that was vested in the

State consequent to several vesting orders, P9, P13 and P14, made under section

38A proviso of the Land Acquisition Act as amended (Act). The lands so acquired

are depicted as lots 18, 19, 23, 24, 2S and 26 in plan no. 632 (P8) which are also

depicted as lots 28, 29, 30, 37, 13 )1" 39, 40 and 41 in village plan no. 660

supplement no. 2 (P1S). According to the Petitioner lot 18 in plan no. 632 is the

same as lot 28 village plan no. 660 supplement no. 2 (P1S).

The Petitioner is seeking a writ of mandamus directing the 2nd Respondent to divest

the unutilised portion of lot no. 28 in village plan no. 660 supplement no. 2 (P1S),

lot no. 30 and lot no. 39 in village plan no. 660 supplement no. 2 (P1S) to the

Petitioner under section 39A of the Act.

It is not in dispute between parties that the said land was acquired by the State

under the Act. The dispute is whether the criteria for divesting has been satisfied.

Section 39A of the Act reads:

"(1) Notwithstanding that by virtue of an Order under section 38 (hereafter

in this section referred to as a " vesting Order") any land has vested

absolutely in the State and actual possession of such land has been taken for

or on behalf of the State under the provisions of paragraph (a) of section 40,

the Minister may, subject to subsection (2), by subsequent Order published

in the Gazette (hereafter in this section referred to as a " divesting Order ")

divest the State of the land so vested by the aforesaid vesting Order.

(2) The Minister shall prior to making a divesting Order under subsection (1)

satisfy himself that

(a) no compensation has been paid under this Act to any person or

persons interested in the land in relation to which the said divesting

Order is to be made;

(b) the said land has not been used for a public purpose after

possession of such land has been taken by the State under the

provisions of paragraph (a) of section 40;

(c) no improvements to the said land have been effected after the

Order for possession under paragraph (a) of section 40 had been

made; and

(d) the person or persons interested in the said land have consented

in writing to take possession of such land immediately after the

divesting Order is published in the Gazette." (emphasis added)

Hence if any improvements have been made on the land the question of divesting

cannot arise.

The documentation pertaining to the acquisition indicates that the land in dispute

was paddy land when it was acquired. This was not contested by the Petitioner. It

is also not disputed that the land has been filled and in the case of lot 18 in plan no.

632 which is the same as lot 28 of village plan no. 660 supplement no. 2, certain

constructions have taken place which now houses Sathosa and Bank of Ceylon. It is

further in evidence that certain stalls have been constructed on part thereof

although it is disputed whether it was by the Petitioner or a third party.

Where paddy land or marshy land was acquired by the State in terms of the Act

which has subsequently been developed in a manner where construction could

commence these amounts to improvements to the said land within the meaning of

section 39A (2)(c) of the Act [Kapugeekiyana v. Hon. Janaka Bandara Tennakone,

Minister of Lands and Others (S.c. Appeal No. 161/2010, S.C.M. 18.11.2013)].

Accordingly, the question of divesting the land claimed by the Petitioner cannot in

any event arise.

In any event, the application for a writ of mandamus is in my view misconceived in

law.

S.N. Silva J. (as he was then) in Kingsley Fernando v. Dayaratne and Others [(1991)

2 SrLL.R. 129] held that section 39A of the Act does not give a right to the former

owner to seek a divesting order even where the pre-conditions are satisfied but

only vests a discretionary power in the Minister to make a divesting order provided

the pre-conditions are satisfied. However, there is a divergence in the approach of

the Supreme Court to this issue. In De Silva v. Atukorale, Minister of Lands,

Irrigation and Mahaweli Development and Another [(1993) 1 SrLL.R. 283] Fernando

J. held that a writ of mandamus will issue directing the Minister to divest land

acquired by the State if the four conditions in section 39A of the Act are fulfilled.

This was quoted with approval and followed by the Supreme Court in Rashid v.

Rajitho Senaratne, Minister of Lands and Others [(2004) 1 SrLL.R. 312] and Mahinda

Katugaha v. Minister of Lands and Land Development and Others [(2008) 1 SrLL.R.

285].

However, the Supreme Court in Urban Development Authority v. Abeyratne and

Others [S.c. Appeal No. 85/2008 & 101/2008; S.C.M. 01.06.2009] took a different

view and held that the exercise of discretionary power vested with the Minister by

section 39A of the Act is not amenable to judicial review in an application for a writ

of mandamus. Similar line of thinking is found in Wijewardena v. Minister of Lands

and Others [S.c. Appeal 56/2008; S.C.M. 24.11.2015] where the Supreme Court

again took the view that section 39A of the Act merely vests a discretionary power

in the Minister to make a divesting order in a case where the pre-conditions

referred to in that section are satisfied and that a former owner cannot demand

such exercise of power.

I have closely examined the different reasons given by the Supreme Court in the

above cases and hold that the reasoning adopted in Urban Development Authority

v. Abeyratne and Others (supra) is logical and compelling since in De Silva v.

Atukorale, Minister of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli Development and Another

(supra) the Supreme Court failed to consider:

a. the provisions and the scheme of the Act,

b. the judgment in Gunasekera v. Minister of Lands & Agriculture (65

N.L.R.119)'

c. that a writ of mandamus covers a situation where there has been no

exercise of power and compels the exercise of power,

d. that mandamus would lie when a statutory duty is cast upon a public

authority with a correlative right to demand its discharge,

e. that section 39A (1) of the Act uses the word "may" which categorically

implies a discretionary power in the Minister,

f. that a writ of mandamus has nothing to do with abuse of discretion.

Furthermore, the reasoning in De Silva v. Atukorale, Minister of Lands, Irrigation

and Mahaweli Development and Another (supra. page 293) is in any event

inconsistent per se for on one hand the court held that a writ of mandamus will

issue if the four pre-conditions are satisfied while on the other hand it held that

even in that situation it would be legitimate for the Minister to decline to divest if

there is some good reason - for instance, that there is now a new public purpose

for which the land is required.

For all the aforesaid reasons, I dismiss the application of the Petitioner but without

costs in the circumstances of the case.

N. Bandula Karunarathna J.

I agree.
