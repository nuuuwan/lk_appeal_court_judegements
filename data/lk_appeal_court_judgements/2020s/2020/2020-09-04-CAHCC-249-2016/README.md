The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) filed this appeal seeking to

set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge of Chillaw

dated 17.11.2016 in Case No. HC Chillaw 167/2006.

Grounds of Appeal

At the stage of the argument, the Learned Counsel for the appellant confined himself to the

following two grounds of appeal:

I. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider whether the alleged incident was a result of a sudden fight.

II. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the defence of voluntary

intoxication.

Page 2 of 12

The contention of the counsel for the appellant (I" j\ccused) was that, the grounds of appeal

which were set above had not been considered in the Judgment delivered by the Learned

High Court Judge of Chillaw.

Facts of the Case

The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Chillaw with the 2nd accused on two charges

as follows;

i) The Accused committed the murder of one Wijenayake Mudalige Anura Wijeratne

on or about 20th June 2004 at Sethsirigarna and thereby committing an offence

punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code read with section 32 of the Penal

Code.

ii) In the same course of transaction, voluntarily caused gnevous hurt to one

Chandrappulige Sujith Nishantha Sanjeewa, thereby committing an offence

punishable under section 315 of the Penal Code read with section 32 of the Penal

Code.

Both accused (1" accused and 2nd accused) separately pleaded not guilty to the said

indictment and the case proceeded to trial. Thereafter the prosecution led 08 witnesses for the

case for prosecution and the appellant gave evidence before Court where the 2nd accused

made a dock statement. Thereafter evidence of defence witness No.03 was led before the

Court and the defence case was closed.

According to the evidence of the prosecution, the deceased had come to tJ:te shop with Dinesh

Sandaruwan to buy petrol. Achala Dinesh (Prosecution Witness 09) had been talking with

Sujith Nishantha Sanjeewa (injured) near the said shop at that time. The two accused had

come with one Saman along the nearby foot path and the 2nd accused had stated that they

~~~~~M~~~~~.~~~~l~~pul~

out a foldable knife and had tried to stab Achala Dinesh (prosecution Witness No.09) on his

head. Sujith Nishantha Sanjeewa had tried to prevent the attack and as a result he got injured

(cut his hand). Thereafter Achala Dinesh (Prosecution Witness No. 09) had run away and hid

Page 3 of 12

himself inside the shop. Then the deceased had cOll}e out of the shop and had started his bike

and the appellant had chased behind the deceased and stabbed him.

The Learned High Court Judge of Chillaw, convicted the appellant (I" Accused) for both

charges and sentenced the appellant (1" Accused) as follows;

I) Imposed the death sentence for the I" charge of Murder.

2) Imposed 01 year rigorous imprisonment and Rs.7500/= fine with a default sentence of

06 months simple imprisonment for the 2nd charge of Voluntarily causing hurt by

dangerous weapons or means.

The 2nd accused was acquitted from both the charges. Being aggrieved by the said conviction

and the sentence, the appellant (I" Accused) preferred an appeal in this court.

Legal Analysis

I. It was contended by the Learned Counsel for the appellant (I" Accused) that the

Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the ground of a sudden fight. In order to

consider the above, I wish to draw my attention to exception 4 to Section 294 of the

Penal Code which reads as follows:-

"Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a

sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender

having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner."

A careful consideration of the said exception indicates that the basis for the mitigation is

purely depending on the fact that the murder had taken place in a sudden fight, which had

occurred in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel. An important ingredient which is

necessary in such instance would be that there was no malice (undue advantage or acted in a

cruel or unusual manner).

In my view, the word "sudden" implies that the reaction of the accused should be almost

instinctive and provocation cannot be considered as sudden when there was time for the

accused to cool off or control his emotions. The Evidence-in-Chief of Prosecution Witness

No.O I led by the Learned Counsel for the accused, in the High Court trial substantiates the

aforementioned stance as follows;

Thus, in considering the available evidence and in the background of legal principles, it is

well observed that the time gap amongst the quarrel and the back off of the deceased from the

appellant had not been utilized by the appellant to cool down his passions.

I may also refer to a decision by the Supreme Court of India which affirms the

aforementioned principal in exercising its criminal appellate jurisdiction in the case of

Ghapoo Yadav and Ors. v. State of M.P. (2003) 3 see 528, the Court held that;

Page 5 of 12

..

"In a heat of passion there must be no ti,,!e for the passions to cool down and that

the parties had in that case before the Court worked themselves into a fury on

account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. Apart from the incident being

the result of a sudden quarrel without premeditation, the law requires that the

offender should not have taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual

manner to be able to claim the benefit of Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC."

However, one can bring the argument that when the plea of sudden fight is pleaded the party

who offers the provocation first is immateriaL The principle is set out explicitly in

explanation to exception 4. However, the offender having taken an undue advantage over the

deceased in the fight will discredit him in such a plea.

The Judicial Medical Officer, who performed the Post Mortem of the deceased, had described

the nature of the weapon which was used for the stab as a knife with a sharp edge (PI). The

nature of the injury one was elaborated as a "penetrating stab injury of the back of the left

side of the chest, 2.2cm, inverted "V" shape" shows that an extensive damage was caused

and must have struck the deceased with very great force. It was also undisputed that the

deceased was unarmed and he had no likelihood of protecting himself from the attack of the

appellant. When considering the medical evidence, the deceased sustained three stab injuries

where all pierce the left lung and cut a vein which affected a sudden death due to a necessary

fatal injury. In my view, this indicates that the appellant had taken an undue advantage over

the situation.

Even if in a textual interpretation to exception 4 to section 294 makes it immaterial to

consider as to which party initiated the fight, a firm observation of evidence placed before the

High Court Judge reveals that the accused himself had created a situation of a confront with

the deceased and the evidence shows that the deceased deliberately tried to ignore the

situation by moving away. It was the accused who attacked him from the back. So my

interpretation is that a perpetrator cannot be given with the favour of getting an undue

advantage of his own wrong. Therefore, I determine that exception 4 to section 294 does not

have an application over the instant case.

Page 7 of 12

Moreover, it may be material to inquire the previqus relationship between the disputants to

see whether the plea of sudden fight is applicable. If the persons are strangers to each other,

until the time of the quarrel and have no previous evidence of contention, the fight will

probably be "in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel" within this exception. However,

the Evidence-in-Chief of Prosecution Witness No.O I led by the Learned Counsel for the

prosecution in the High Court trial reveals that there has been a previous enmity between the

parties;

In furtherance to the above discussed evidence, [n the case of State of Bihar vs. Rada

Krishna- AIR, 1983 Sc. 684 it was held that "One of the most difficult tasks of a Judge is

to assess and evaluate the evidence of a witness and decide whether to believe or disbelieve

it". In Bhoj Raj vs. Seetha Ram - AIR 1936 Pc. 60, it was held that real test for either

accepting or rejecting evidence are how consistent is the story with itself, how it stands the

test of cross examination, how far it fIXing with the rest of the evidence and the

circumstances of the case ".

Accordingly, my view is that the denial of the accused about him not carrying the weapon

and about previous enmity does not fit the rest of the evidence (evidence of PW No.1 and PW

No.9) and the circumstances of the case and due to that reason the Court rejects the evidence

of defence witness No. 0 I that he was not carrying the weapon and about previous enmities.

Page 8 of 12

The Fundamental principle that "if the circumstanc;es which would bring the case with one

of the exceptions is involved in doubt, the existence of these circumstances cannot be said

to have proved" as established by the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case

of The King v James Chandrasekera (1942) 44 N.L.R 97 is applicable to the case in hand.

The court is not satisfied about the existence of the circumstances of a sudden fight. Hence, in

the entirety, considering the factual scenario of the case in hand, the evidence on record and

in the background of legal principles, my conclusion is that the acts of appellant do not fall

within the parameters set out in the Exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code.

II. The Counsel for the appellant has argued that the Learned High Court Judge has

failed to consider the defence of 'voluntary intoxication'. This position has never been

raised by the defence at any stage of the trial. Further, I observe that the Learned High

Court Judge had considered the plea of intoxication in the judgment as follows;

" .... 01 ~~lSlea1 <::I Se.)C:> !!!ICo)OeJzof e,,d"e.)~ eee" e"le~e'eC) <Ild BC) d~eJl:\l BSzof

26 of the High Court JUdgement)

In Jayathilaka v Attorney-General (2003) 1 Sri L.R 107, even if the court held that;

"the learned trial judge has not directed the jury that the intoxication

necessary to reduce an offence from murder to culpable homicide not

amounting to murder on the ground of absence of murderous intention and

set aside the conviction for murder entered against the accused-appel/ant

and substitute therefor a conviction for culpable homicide not amounting to

murder"

Page 9 of 12

Thus the Ratio decidendi of the above cited case establi.shed that;

"i) though the accused has not taken up the defence of intoxication if such defence

arises on the evidence it is the duty of the jury to consider the same.

ii) In cases of involuntary intoxication the test is the same as that applicable to

insanity, namely the degree of intoxication is such that the accused was totally

deprived of capacity to apprehend the nature of the act or its wrongful or illegal

character. The section dealing with voluntary intoxication is of wider scope in that

the effect of the provision is not confined to intoxication in this degree, but applies

to all cases of self-induced intoxication in any degree so long as the offence

specifies some definite knowledge or intent as an essential ingredient. "

Further, I would like to appreciate, espouse and quote as to how Edirisuriya, J. in the

aforesaid Judgement admire the approach taken by the trial judge to direct the jury in the

defence of voluntary intoxication.

It was held in A.M.P. Ratnayake Vs The Queen 73 NLR 481 that there was no misdirection

on the plea of intoxication in furtherance of;

" For the purposes of section 79 (of the Penal Code) the state of intoxication in

which a person should be is one in which he is incapable of forming a murderous

intention; and whether he has reached that state of intoxication or not is a question

of fact that has to be determined depending on the evidence in each case; and it is

for the person who raises the plea of drunkenness to establish on a balance of

probability that he had reached that state of intoxication in which he could not have

formed a murderous intention. "

Page 10 of 12

'.

In the instance case the Learned High Court has ample of evidence to conclude that the

Accused had reached a certain level of voluntary intoxication. Nevertheless he has correctly

decided that such degree had not reached to a level for the accused to exculpate from his

guilty mens rea. In derterrnining so the Leamed High Court Judge has compared the previous

and the subsequent conduct of the accused in order to assess his degree of intoxication and

the murderous intention therein.

Court Judgement)

In the case of A bey Mudalali v. Attorney General (2005) 2 Sri. L.R. 162, it was held that,

"In a case of murder, if an accused person raises the plea of drunkenness under

section 79, the burden is on the Accused to prove on a balance of probability that

he had reached the state of intoxication in which he could not have formed a

murderous intention at the time of alleged act was done. "

There is no such plea raised or such fact proved on a balance of probability on behalf of the

accused (1st Acc.used) in the instant case. Therefore I am of the view that where an accused is

shown to have entertained a particular intention after the imputation of knowledge envisaged

under section 79, he should be convicted of the offence notwithstanding his level of

intoxication and he is not covered under section 79 of the Penal Code.

Page 11 of 12

,

For the reasons set out above, I am of the view tlpt the Leamed High Court Judge came to

the correct conclusion after a careful consideration of all the evidence that was placed before

him. Therefore, I do not wish to interfere with the conviction and the sentence imposed on the

appellant, by the Learned High Court Judge and I affirm the same.

This appeal is hereby dismissed.
