Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Pasindu Silva for the Petitioner Ms. Yuresha Fernando, Senior State Counsel for the 1st 6th and 8th 12th Respondents Argued on: 6th July 2020 Written Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 25th February 2020 Tendered on behalf of the 1st 6th and 8th 12th Respondents on 29th July 2020 Decided on: 31st August 2020 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J The Petitioner, who holds the rank of Captain (Temporary) in the Volunteer Force of

the Sri Lanka Army, has filed this application seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision reflected in the letter marked P18 to retire the Petitioner from

the Sri Lanka Army with effect from 18th January 20191.

The Petitioner has also sought a Writ of Mandamus compelling the Respondents to

confirm the Petitioner in the rank of Captain, and a Writ of Prohibition preventing

the Respondents from retiring or discharging the Petitioner from the Sri Lanka Army

without confirming him in the rank of Captain with effect from 1st December 2011.

I must state at the outset that the decision to promote the Petitioner to the rank of

Captain or confirm him in that rank, must be taken by the Commander of the Sri

Lanka Army, and/or by the Commander, on the recommendation of the Army

Selection Board, taking into consideration the provisions relating to such promotion.

As long as due process has been followed and the decision to deny the Petitioner his

promotion and/or retire the Petitioner is not arbitrary, irrational or unreasonable,

1 Vide paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to the petition.

4

this Court shall not interfere with the decision of the Commander of the Sri Lanka

Army in relation to such promotion.

As pointed out by Justice Sripavan (as he then was) in Wikramaratne vs Commander

of the Army and others2:

in service matters, the 1st Respondent should be left with a free hand to make

decisions with regard to the internal administration of the Army in the interest

of efficiency, discipline, exigencies of service etc. The Court cannot interfere with

the appointment or promotion unless the first respondent has acted unlawfully,

arbitrarily, or guided by ulterior considerations which are discriminatory or

unfair.

Therefore, I am of the view that the prayer for the Writ of Mandamus is

misconceived in view of the fact that (a) the Petitioner is not entitled to be promoted

to the rank of Captain as of right, and (b) the promotion is at the discretion of the

Commander, Sri Lanka Army. I cannot consider the Writ of Prohibition for the same

reason. Hence, I shall only consider whether P18 is liable to be quashed by a Writ of

Certiorari.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner had joined the Volunteer Force of the Sri Lanka Army on 9th January

2002 as a Cadet Officer. Having undergone training, the Petitioner had been

commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on 6th January 2003. He had thereafter served

in various parts of the Country, including operational areas, and had been awarded

several medals for his service. The Petitioner had been promoted to the rank of

Lieutenant in June 2008, and had been promoted as Captain (Temporary) on 1st

December 2011.

The Petitioner states that he received the following letter dated 9th February 2018,

marked P18 from the Commandant of the Volunteer Force:

2 CA (Writ) Application No. 800/2006 CA Minutes of 07th January 2008.

5

The Army Board No. 03 assembled on 19th December 2017 examined the SLAVF

Board proceedings and stipulated criteria with regard to the confirmation of the

rank of Temporary Captain and determining their career progression. The Board

having perused your adverse disciplinary records, recommended you to be

retired from the SLAVF after a period of 1 year with effect from 18th January

2018 ...

It is brought to your information that the Commander of the Army has approved

the above recommendation made by the Army Board No. 3.

The Petitioner states that although he sought an audience with the 1st Respondent,

the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army, the said request was not granted. The

Petitioner had thereafter submitted a Redress of Grievance, which too had not been

considered favourably by the 1st Respondent.3

In terms of Regulations 15(1) and 15(2) of the Sri Lanka Army (Volunteer Force and

Volunteer Reserve) Regulations, 19854 (the Volunteer Force Regulations), an Officer

may be promoted to the substantive rank of Captain on completion of three years

efficient service in the rank of Lieutenant on the active strength of the Volunteer

Force, and provided that:

(a) The Officer has passed the examination for that rank;

(b) The Officer has regularly attended training camps, parades, mobilizations and

participated in other regimental activities to the satisfaction of the

Commanding Officer of his Regiment; and

(c) The Officer has been recommended by his Commanding Officer and

Commandant, Volunteer Force, as being suitable for promotion.

It is agreed between the parties that the procedure that is followed in the

confirmation of an Officer in the rank of Captain in the Volunteer Force is as follows:5

3 Vide letter dated 26th November 2018, marked P22. 4 Published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 476/26 dated 20th October 1987. 5 Vide paragraph 21 of the petition, and paragraph 10 of the Statement of Objections.

6

a) At the request of the Military Secretary, the Commanding Officer of the Unit to

which the Petitioner is attached is required to submit his recommendation on

the suitability of the promotion of the Petitioner, to the Colonel of the

Petitioners Regiment;

b) The Colonel of the Regiment is required to submit the above recommendation,

together with his recommendation, to the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force

Headquarters;

c) The Commandant of the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force is required to submit

the above recommendations, together with his recommendation, to the

Military Secretary;

d) The Directorate of Training is required to send the results of the Petitioners

Physical Efficiency Test to the Military Secretary;

e) The Army Selection Board No. 3 shall consider the aforesaid recommendations

and submit its decision to the Commander, Sri Lanka Army;

f) The promotion is effected by the Commander, Sri Lanka Army.

The Respondents have not apprised this Court whether the Petitioner has satisfied

the provisions of Regulations 15(1) and 15(2), nor have the Respondents apprised

this Court whether the promotion and/or confirmation of the Petitioner has not

been recommended by the Commanding Officer of the Unit to which the Petitioner is

attached to, the Colonel of the Petitioners Regiment, and the Commandant of the

Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force.

The starting point of the Petitioners case is the letter dated 28th November 2012,

marked P15 by which the Commandant of the Volunteer Force had informed the

Petitioner as follows:

The Army Board No. 3 which assembled on 5th September 2012, examined the

SLAVF Board proceedings and the stipulated criteria with regard to the

Promotion of Officers in the rank of Temporary Captain. The Board considered

7

the period of AWOL6, contribution in humanitarian operations and the

accumulated service of Officers who have been AWOL over 21 days.

Accordingly, you have been AWOL for over 21 days from 24thJuly 2006 to 1st

December 2006 (130 days). The Board has recommended to retain in service

until completion of 20 years of service with due promotion.

It is brought to your information that the Commander of the Army has

approved the above recommendation made by the Army Board No. 3.

The Petitioner states that P15 was a clear representation made to him that the Sri

Lanka Army, having taken into consideration his past record of service had decided to

retain his services until he completes twenty years of service, with due promotions

during that period, and more importantly that the said decision had been approved

by the 1st Respondent. The Petitioner has therefore submitted that P15 gave rise to

a legitimate expectation that he would not only be promoted but that he would be

retained in service until he completed 20 years of service.

As noted earlier, an Officer only requires three years in the rank of Lieutenant, prior

to being promoted to the rank of Captain. Even though the Petitioner had been

promoted as Captain (Temporary) in 2011, and the above recommendation was

conveyed to the Petitioner in November 2012, the Respondents have not explained

why the Petitioner has not been promoted to the rank of Captain after P15 was

issued in November 2012.

Two and a half years later, by a letter dated 6th March 2015 marked P16, the

Commandant of the Volunteer Force had informed the Petitioner as follows:

The Army Board No. 3 which assembled on 3rd December 2014, examined the

SLAVF Board proceedings and the stipulated criteria with regard to the

Confirmation of Officers in the rank of Captain. The Board considered the period

of AWOL, contribution in humanitarian operations and the accumulated service

of Officers who have been AWOL over 21 days.

6 AWOL is the acronym for Absent without leave.

8

It had been observed that you had been AWOL for over 21 days from 24th July

2006 to 1st December 2006 (130 days). Hence, the Board had recommended you

be retained in service for another one year from the date the Board assembled

and thereafter retire from the SLAVF without future promotions and selections.

Further, it is brought to your information that the Commander of the Army has

approved the above recommendation made by the Army Board No. 3.

It would thus be seen that the decision in P16 is a 180o turn from the decision in

P15, even though the factors that have been considered by both Army Selection

Boards are identical. Furthermore, the reason for the change appears to be the fact

that the Petitioner was AWOL for 130 days in 2006, a factor which ought to have

been considered by the Sri Lanka Army when it promoted the Petitioner to the rank

of Lieutenant in 2008, and Temporary Captain in 2011, and more importantly, a

factor which was considered when the decision P15 was taken in 2012 to promote

the Petitioner.

I would now consider the explanation offered by the Respondents for the change in

mind reflected in P16. The Respondents have stated that in addition to the criteria

referred to in Regulation 15(1) and (2), the promotion or confirmation in the rank of

Lieutenant as well as Captain in the Volunteer Force is carried out in accordance with

the criteria stipulated in the letter dated 10th July 2006, marked R3. Paragraph 10 of

the criteria applicable for promotion to the rank of Captain reads as follows:

An Officer who has been low medically categorized due to non battle casualty,

will be considered for confirmation on completion of one year mobilised service

after being categorized as FE.

It is admitted that in June 2008, while returning after duty, the Petitioner had

accidently fallen near the entrance to the Army Hospital, and had suffered injury. The

Petitioner had thereafter presented himself before a Medical Board of the Sri Lanka

Army, which had arrived at the opinion that the Petitioner sustained the said injury

whilst on duty resulting in distal radial fracture on left side and that his injury can be

categorized as a permanent partial disablement.7

7 Vide Proceedings of the Medical Board marked P13b.

9

In their Statement of Objections, the Respondents have stated that the Petitioner

had failed to qualify in the Annual Physical Examination Test (APET) as shown in the

Annual Confidential Reports for the years 2013 and 2014, which reflected that the

Petitioner was of a low medical category for a long period of time due to non-battle

reasons, and that in view of paragraph 10 of R3, the Army Board decided to retire

the Petitioner after one year from the decision of the Board without promotions.8

What is important in this explanation is the fact that the Respondents are not

claiming that there has been a change of circumstances during the period of

November 2012 when the decision in P15 was taken, and March 2015, when the

decision at P16 was reached.

In any event, although the Respondents have taken up the above position in their

Statement of Objections, the decision of the Army Selection Board No. 3, as

conveyed by P16 does not refer to the medical condition of the Petitioner at all, but

instead refers to the Petitioner being AWOL as the reason for its decision.

Furthermore, while in terms of R3, the medical condition of the Petitioner can be a

ground on which his confirmation can be deferred, it does not appear that the

medical condition of the Petitioner is a ground on which his promotion could be

denied or, a ground on which the Petitioner could be retired from service.

The contradictory positions between P15 and P16 had been considered by the

Commander of the Sri Lanka Army, and by letter dated 30th October 2015, marked

P17, the Commandant of the Volunteer Force had informed the Petitioner as

follows:

Therefore, seeking of above contradictory decisions during the promotion and

confirmation Boards on two occasions, the Commander of the Army has

directed to implement the first Board decision which was given by the Army

Board No. 3.

Hence, it is brought to your information that the Commander of the Army has

approved to implement the Board decision given to retire you at the completion

of 20 years of reckonable service with due promotion.

8 Vide paragraph 21 of the Statement of Objections.

10

Thus, P17 has made it clear that, irrespective of the medical condition of the

Petitioner and the AWOL incident, the Commander of the Sri Lanka Army is of the

opinion that the Petitioner can continue in the Sri Lanka Army until he completes

twenty years of service, and that he would be entitled to his promotions. Even

though P17 had been issued in October 2015, the Respondents have once again

failed to explain the reasons that prevented the Petitioner from being confirmed in

the rank of Captain after P17.

The confirmation of the Petitioner in the rank of Captain appears to have been

considered once again by the Sri Lanka Army in December 2017, as borne out by the

letter dated 9th February 2018, marked P18:

The Army Board No. 3 assembled on 19th December 2017, examined the SLAVF

Board proceedings and the stipulated criteria with regard to the Confirmation of

the rank of Temporary Captain and determining their career progression. The

Board having perused your adverse disciplinary records, recommended you to

be retired from the SLAVF after a period of one year with effect from 18th

January 2018, the AHQ Board proceedings are approved.

It is brought to your information that the Commander of the Army has approved

the above recommendation made by the Army Board No. 3

As the basis for the above decision is the adverse disciplinary record of the Petitioner,

it would be appropriate to refer to at this stage, the disciplinary record of the

Petitioner. The Petitioner admits that he was absent without leave (AWOL) from 24th

July 2006 to 30th November 2006, and that following a summary trial, his seniority

was reduced by 100 places, in addition to a penal deduction of salary for 130 days.

The Petitioner had also been severely warned over an incident where he is said to

have failed to participate at a social event of the Sri Lanka Army in 2006. Finally in

2014, the Petitioner had been kept under observation for six months over an

incident where the Petitioner had submitted an application seeking admission of his

son to the Defence College through the Ministry of Defence, instead of forwarding

the application through the Regimental Head.

11

The contradictory positions in P17 and P18 had been brought to the attention of

the Military Secretary by the Commandant of the Volunteer Force, by his letter dated

16th February 2018 marked R4, which reads as follows:

The AHQ Board No. 3 assembled on 19th December 2017, has given a Board

decision against the undermentioned Officer to be retired from the SLAVF after

a period of one year with effect from the date the AHQ Board proceedings are

approved, based on adverse disciplinary records, at vide ref B:

1. T/Captain H.D.C.Perera AWOL 130 days (calculable service 15 years 08

months and 22 days)

2. ......

However, the Military Secretary .... has informed this HQ to retain the Officers in

service until they complete 20 years of service with due promotion. It is

observed that the aforementioned Officers have completed over 15 years of

calculable service as on 12th February 2018, and hence the directions of AHQ

Board No. 3 at Ref B with Ref C and D are inconsistent.

In the light of the above, request for further instructions on implementation of

the Board decision or making appropriate changes to the Board decision,

please.

While the Respondents have not given any details of the adverse disciplinary record

of the Petitioner that prompted the Army Selection Board No. 3 that met on 19th

December 2017 to arrive at the above conclusion, it appears from R4 that the Board

was referring to the incident where the Petitioner was AWOL in 2006. Thus, the

incident that appears to have influenced the decision in P18 is the AWOL incident.

The response of the Military Secretary to R4 has been marked as R5,9 and reads as

follows:

Ref.B. AHQ Board proceedings dated 19th December 2011

Ref. C. AHQ Board proceedings dated 5th September 2012

9 Letter dated 22nd February 2018.

12

Ref. D. AHQ Board proceedings dated 19th December 2017

In response to letter at Ref A, it is hereby intimated that the Board decisions

given by Ref B and C are superseded by the decisions given by the Board

proceedings at Ref. D.

Accordingly, the Officers concerned to be retired from the Army after elapsing a

period of one year with effect from the date the AHQ Board proceedings at Ref.

D are approved.

Even though P18 refers to the adverse disciplinary record of the Petitioner as being

the reason for the decision contained therein, in their Statement of Objections, the

Respondents have stated that the Petitioner failed to qualify in the Annual Physical

Efficiency Test during the years 2013 2016, and that he has been categorized as

below average due to non-battle reasons, and that it is for this reason that the

Army Selection Board did not recommend the Petitioner to be confirmed in the rank

of Captain.

The uncertainty and the indecisiveness did not stop here. The Petitioner has

produced marked P21 the following letter dated 10th October 2018 sent by the Sri

Lanka Army to the Secretary, Ministry of Defence:

The Respondents have not explained in their Statement of Objections whether P21

replaces P18, and the effect of P21 on the decision in P18 to retire the Petitioner

with effect from 18th January 2019.

It is therefore clear from P15, P16, P17 and P18 that the Respondents have re-

evaluated the same set of facts on four different occasions, and had arrived at

inconsistent decisions.

It is in the above circumstances that this Court must consider the two arguments of

the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, that the decision contained in P18 (a) is a

violation of his legitimate expectations, and (b) is arbitrary and irrational.

The principal argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that P15 gave

rise to a legitimate expectation that he would not only be promoted, but that he

would be retained in service until he completed 20 years of service.

In considering this submission of the Petitioner, I have to consider three matters. The

first is whether the representation made to the Petitioner through P15, that the

Board has recommended to retain (him) in service until completion of 20 years of

service with due promotion, can in fact give rise to a legitimate expectation. The

second is whether there has been a departure from the representation that gave rise

to the said legitimate expectation of the Petitioner. The third is whether the said

departure is fair and justifiable.

14

The rationale for holding public authorities accountable to representations made to

individuals is founded on rules of natural justice, administrative fairness, and legal

certainty. As stated in De Smiths Judicial Review:10

It is a basic principle of fairness that legitimate expectations ought not to be

thwarted.11 The protection of legitimate expectations is at the root of the

constitutional principle of the Rule of Law, which requires regularity,

predictability, and certainty in Governments dealings with the public.

In S.F. Zamrath v. Sri Lanka Medical Council and others12 Dehideniya, J, observed

that:

The legitimate expectation of a person ensures that, the administrative

authorities are bound by their undertakings and assurances unless there are

compelling reasons to change the policy subsequently. It further ensures legal

certainty which is imperative as the people ought to plan their lives, secure in

the knowledge of the consequences of their actions. The perception of legal

certainty deserves protection, as a basic tenet of the rule of law which this

court attempts to uphold as the apex court of the country. The public perception

of legal certainty becomes negative when the authorities by their own

undertakings and assurances have generated legitimate expectations of people

and subsequently by their own conduct, infringe the so generated expectations.

Lord Denning has stated that, (in Recent Developments in the Doctrine of

Consideration13) A man should keep his word. All the more so when the

promise is not a bare promise, but is made with the intention that the other

party should act upon it. The principle of legitimate expectation is connected

with an administrative authority and an individual. (emphasis added)

Simon Brown LJ in the case of R v. Devon County Council, Ex parte Baker and

Another14 suggested that a representation made in respect of a substantive right or

benefit, attracts a standard of protection akin to estoppel:

10 Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review [8th Edition, 2018] Sweet and Maxwell, page 673. 11J. Rawls, A Theory of Justice (1972), pp 235-243 (as referred to in De Smiths Judicial Review (Supra)). 12 SCFR 119/2019; SC Minutes of 23rd July 2019. 13 The Modern Law Review, Volume 15 [1952] at page 5. 14 [1995] 1 All ER 73 at page 88.

15

the claimant's right will only be found established when there is a clear and

unambiguous representation upon which it was reasonable for him to rely.

Then the administrator or other public body will be held bound in fairness by the

representation made unless only its promise or undertaking as to how its

power would be exercised is inconsistent with the statutory duties imposed

upon it. The doctrine employed in this sense is akin to an estoppel. (emphasis

added)

The above passage identifies two key features that Courts consider essential in order

to qualify a representation as legitimate, or in other words, in determining the

legitimacy of an expectation. One is that the representation made must be clear and

unambiguous.15 The other is that the decision is consistent with the statutory duties

conferred on the authority, and not made in excess of power, i.e. the representation

must be made by a person with actual or ostensible authority to make the

representation.16

The onus of proving that a clear, unambiguous representation devoid of

qualifications was made is on the party who wishes to rely on it. In Paponette and

Others v Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago17, Lord Dyson held as follows:

The initial burden lies on an applicant to prove the legitimacy of his

expectation. This means that in a claim based on a promise, the applicant must

prove the promise and that it was clear and unambiguous and devoid of

relevant qualification. If he wishes to reinforce his case by saying that he relied

on the promise to his detriment, then obviously he must prove that too.

Having carefully examined P15, I am satisfied that the representation made by the

Commandant of the Volunteer Force satisfies the abovementioned criteria. In my

view, the said representation is clear, unambiguous, is not subject to any

qualifications, and has received the approval of the Commander of the Army, as

expressly contained in P15. Therefore, I am of the view that P15 gave rise to a 15 the ruling or statement relied upon should be clear, unambiguous and devoid of relevant qualification.R v. IRC Ex p. MFK Underwriting Agencies Ltd [1990] 1 WLR 1545 at 1569, followed in several subsequent cases; R (Patel) v General Medical Council [2013] EWCA Civ 327. 16South Buckinghamshire DC v. Flanagan [2002] EWCA Civ 690. 17 [2012] 1 AC 1, para 37, at page 14.

16

legitimate expectation that the Petitioner will be retained in service until the

completion of 20 years of service with due promotion.

The next question that I must consider is whether there has been a departure from

the said representation made by P15. The answer to this question is fairly simple, in

that it is clear from P18 that the Respondents have done a 180o turn from P15, and

P17.

Once an applicant succeeds in proving the legitimacy of his expectation, the burden

of proof shifts to the authority to justify the frustration of the expectation so created.

In Paponette v Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago18, Lord Dyson went on to

state that:

Once these elements have been proved by the applicant, however, the onus

shifts to the authority to justify the frustration of the legitimate expectation. It is

for the authority to identify any overriding interest on which it relies to justify

the frustration of the expectation. It will then be a matter for the court to

weigh the requirements of fairness against that interest. (emphasis added)

Therefore, once the existence of a legitimate expectation is apparent, Courts must

decide by what standard the decision to disappoint a legitimate expectation can be

scrutinised in order to determine if any relief should be granted. The question here is

whether a breach of a legitimate expectation should be reviewed under the

traditional grounds for judicial review, i.e. Wednesbury unreasonableness or

irrationality (in the absence of illegality or procedural impropriety), or, by a more

intrusive standard.

The case of R v North and East Devon Health Authority, Ex p Coughlan19, which is

still considered the leading authority on the doctrine of legitimate expectation,20

concerned a decision of a public authority to disappoint a promise made to the

appellant in that case, who was a severely disabled lady, of a home for life by

closing down Mardon House, which was a residential care home providing specialist

18 Ibid. 19[2001] QB 213. 20 See In the matter of an application by Geraldine Finucane for Judicial Review (Northern Ireland) [2019] UKSC 7.

17

care. In this case, Lord Woolf MR described the following three ways in which a

legitimate expectation may arise, and the role of the Courts in respect of each

category of cases:

(a) The court may decide that the public authority is only required to bear in

mind its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it

thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course. Here

the court is confined to reviewing the decision on Wednesbury grounds.

(b) On the other hand the court may decide that the promise or practice

induces a legitimate expectation of, for example, being consulted before a

particular decision is taken. Here it is uncontentious that the court itself

will require the opportunity for consultation to be given unless there is an

overriding reason to resile from it.

(c) Where the court considers that a lawful promise or practice has induced a

legitimate expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not simply

procedural, authority now establishes that here too the court will in a

proper case decide whether to frustrate the expectation is so unfair that

to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power.

Here, once the legitimacy of the expectation is established, the court will

have the task of weighing the requirements of fairness against any

overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy.

In theory, the first category of cases would involve matters of public policy,

represented to the world at large21, as opposed to a distinct group of individuals. In

such cases, the Courts role is limited to reviewing such policy decisions at most on a

bare Wednesbury basis, without themselves donning the garb of policy-maker, which

they cannot wear.22 The second and third categories stated in Ex parte Coughlan

reflect procedural and substantive legitimate expectation.

21 Where a representation is made generally, directed to the world at large, this usually means that the public authority has adopted a policy De Smiths Judicial review (supra), page 685. 22Supra.

18

The primary distinction between procedural and substantive legitimate expectation

has been stated in R. (Bhatt Murphy (a firm)) v. The Independent Assessor23 as

follows:

In the procedural case we find a promise or practice of notice or consultation in

the event of a contemplated change. In the substantive case we have a promise

or practice of present and future substantive policy. This difference is at the core

of the distinction between procedural and substantive legitimate expectation.

However, in practice, the task of assigning facts of each case to the said categories is

not clear-cut, and therefore, later cases have pointed out that the categories

explained in Ex parte Coughlan are not hermetically sealed.24 This is especially so in

relation to the first and third categories, where a policy decision, as stated in the first

category may have the effect of depriving a previously promised substantial benefit,

as envisaged by the third category.

As Laws LJ, in Regina v. Secretary of State of Education and Employment, Ex parte

Begbie25opined:

Fairness and reasonableness (and their contraries) are objective concepts;

otherwise there would be no public law, or if there were it would be palm tree

justice. But each is a spectrum, not a single point, and they shade into one

another. It is now well established that the Wednesbury principle itself

constitutes a sliding scale of review, more or less intrusive according to the

nature and gravity of what is at stake.

At one end of the spectrum are those which Laws LJ termed as decisions which lie in

the macro political field26, where the Courts supervision would be less intrusive,

whereas at the other end of the spectrum lie decisions which may take place on a

23 [2008] EWCA Civ 755. 24 Regina v. The Department of Education and Employment, Ex parte Begbie[2000] 1 WLR 1115, Laws LJ. 25[2000] 1 WLR 1115. 26 Ibid. Laws LJ: The more the decision challenged lies in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field, the less intrusive will be the courts supervision. More than this: in that field, true abuse of power is less likely to be found, since within it changes of policy, fueled by broad conceptions of the public interest, may more readily be accepted as taking precedence over the interests of groups which enjoyed expectations generated by an earlier policy.

19

much smaller stage, with far fewer players27, where a Courts condemnation of what

is done as an abuse of power is justifiable because the court may be able to envisage

clearly and with sufficient certainty what the full consequences will be of any order it

makes.28

As Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, P.C., observed in Ginigathgala Mohandiramlage

Nimalsiri v. Colonel P.P.J. Fernando:29

In order to seek redress under the doctrine of legitimate expectation a person

should prove he had a legitimate expectation which was based on a promise or

an established practice. Thus, the applicability of the said doctrine is based on

the facts and circumstances of each case.

Therefore, it is clear that there cannot exist a blanket standard of review applicable

to all cases of legitimate expectation, and the facts of the case, viewed always in

their statutory context, will steer the court to a more or less intrusive quality of

review,30 bearing in mind the fundamental principle that the doctrine of legitimate

expectation is rooted in fairness.31

As observed in De Smiths Judicial Review32:

On the whole, however, where a legitimate expectation has been disappointed

the onus should be on the authority to justify its frustration. No magic formula

can reach the right answer as to whether the expectation should be honored,

but in considering whether the disappointment of an expectation is deserving of

protection, the following factors may be relevant:

a) The subject matter of the representation; b) Whether the decision is particular or general; c) Degree of reassurance;

27Ibid. page 1131. 28ibid. 29 SCFR 256/2010; SC Minutes of 17th September 2015. 30Regina v. The Department of Education and Employment, Ex parte Begbie (Supra). 31R v. Inland Revenue Commissioners Ex p. MFK Underwriting Agencies Ltd.[1990] 1 WLR 1545 at 1569-1570. 32 Supra. pages 699- 701.

20

d) Nature of the decision; e) Detrimental reliance; f) Mitigation of the effects of a disappointed expectation.

A key factor that influenced the decision in Ex parte Coughlan33 was the fact that the

promise was limited to a few individuals. It was observed that:

most cases of an enforceable expectation of a substantive benefit (the third

category) are likely in the nature of things to be cases where the expectation is

confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation

the character of a contract. (emphasis added)

Having carefully considered P18 in light of the above authorities, I am of the view

that the decision contained in P18 to deprive the Petitioner of the substantive

legitimate expectation contained in P15 is a classic case which falls within the latter

end of the spectrum, inviting a higher degree of scrutiny by Courts on the grounds of

fairness and abuse of power.

The test of balancing fairness as noted in the following passage of Sedley J in R. v.

Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, Ex parte Hamble (Offshore) Fisheries

Ltd.34 was cited with approval by Justice A.R.B. Amerasinghe in Dayaratne and

Others v. Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine and Others35 and supports

the present position in Sri Lankan law on the subject of legitimate expectation:36

"Legitimacy in this sense is not an absolute. It is a function of expectations

induced by government and of policy considerations which militate against their

fulfillment. The balance must, in the first instance, be for the policy-maker to

strike; but if the outcome is challenged by way of judicial review, I do not 33[2001] QB 213, para 59, at page 242. 34 [1995] 2 All ER 714 at 731. 35[1999] 1 Sri LR 393. 36 M.R.C.C. Ariyarathne and Others v. Inspector General of Police, Police and others [SCFR 444/2010; SC Minutes of 30th July 2019], Justice Prasanna Jayewardena, P.C. - it should be mentioned here that Coughlan had not been decided at the time Amerasinghe, J, specifically approved of Sedley Js test in Hamble (Offshore) Fisheries Limited. However, as observed earlier, Lord Woolf, MRs test in Coughlan is on much the same lines as Sedley Js test. Thus, the weight of the English Law stands firmly behind the approach formulated by Amerasinghe J in Dayarathna.

21

consider that the court's criterion is the bare rationality of the policy-maker's

conclusion. While policy is for the policy-maker alone, the fairness of his or her

decision not to accommodate reasonable expectations which the policy will

thwart remains the Court's concern (as of course does the lawfulness of the

policy). To postulate this is not to place the judge in the seat of the Minister... it

is the court's task to recognise the constitutional importance of ministerial

freedom to formulate and to reformulate policy; but it is equally the court's duty

to protect the interests of those individuals whose expectation of different

treatment has a legitimacy which in fairness outtops the policy choice which

threatens to frustrate it."

In Nadarajah Abdi v. The Secretary of State for the Home Department37 Laws LJ

expressed caution in relying on the broad concept of abuse of power in reviewing

decisions concerning breach of legitimate expectation, and attempted to provide a

degree of certainty to the general use of the principle of fairness by suggesting a test

akin to proportionality:

Abuse of power is a name for any act of a public authority that is not legally

justified. It is a useful name, for it catches the moral impetus of the rule of law.

It may be, as I ventured to put it in Begbie, "the root concept which governs and

conditions our general principles of public law". But it goes no distance to tell

you, case by case, what is lawful and what is not. I accept, of course, that there

is no formula which tells you that; if there were, the law would be nothing but a

checklist. Legal principle lies between the overarching rubric of abuse of power

and the concrete imperatives of a rule-book.

The search for principle surely starts with the theme that is current through the

legitimate expectation cases. It may be expressed thus. Where a public

authority has issued a promise or adopted a practice which represents how it

proposes to act in a given area, the law will require the promise or practice to be

honoured unless there is good reason not to do so. What is the principle behind

this proposition? It is not far to seek. It is said to be grounded in fairness, and no

doubt in general terms that is so. I would prefer to express it rather more

broadly as a requirement of good administration, by which public bodies ought

37[2005] EWCA Civ 1363.

22

to deal straightforwardly and consistently with the public. In my judgment this is

a legal standard which, although not found in terms in the European Convention

on Human Rights, takes its place alongside such rights as fair trial, and no

punishment without law. That being so there is every reason to articulate the

limits of this requirement to describe what may count as good reason to

depart from it as we have come to articulate the limits of other constitutional

principles overtly found in the European Convention. Accordingly a public body's

promise or practice as to future conduct may only be denied, and thus the

standard I have expressed may only be departed from, in circumstances where

to do so is the public body's legal duty, or is otherwise, to use a now familiar

vocabulary, a proportionate response (of which the Court is the judge, or the

last judge) having regard to a legitimate aim pursued by the public body in the

public interest. The principle that good administration requires public

authorities to be held to their promises would be undermined if the law did not

insist that any failure or refusal to comply is objectively justified as a

proportionate measure in the circumstances.

In, In the matter of an application by Geraldine Finucane for Judicial Review

(Northern Ireland),38 the UK Supreme Court, after considering the aforementioned

authorities held as follows:

Where a clear and unambiguous undertaking has been made, the authority

giving the undertaking will not be allowed to depart from it unless it is shown

that it is fair to do so. The court is the arbiter of fairness in this context. And a

matter sounding on the question of fairness is whether the alteration in policy

frustrates any reliance which the person or group has placed on it. This is quite

different, in my opinion, from saying that it is a prerequisite of a substantive

legitimate expectation claim that the person relying on it must show that he or

she has suffered a detriment.

Having traced the evolution of the doctrine of legitimate expectation in Sri Lanka,

India, and in England, Justice Prasanna Jayewardena, P.C., in M.R.C.C. Ariyarathne

38Supra.

23

and Others v. Inspector General of Police, Police and others,39 stated the present

position on legitimate expectation in Sri Lanka as follows:

Court should weigh the character and substance of the expectation and the

prejudice caused to the petitioner by its frustration, on the one hand; against

the importance of the public interest which led to the public authoritys change

of heart, on the other hand; and then decide whether that exercise of weighing

the competing interests leads to the conclusion that the petitioners expectation

is of such weight and the consequences of its frustration are so prejudicial to

him when compared to the public interest relied on by the public authority, that

the public authoritys decision to change its policy and negate the expectation

was disproportionate or unfair or unjust and amounted to an abuse of power

which should be quashed; or whether the decision to change the policy should

stand because the public authority has acted proportionately, fairly and justly

when it decided that the petitioners substantive legitimate expectation could

not be granted since public interest demanded a change of policy.

Let me now consider whether the decision in P18 is a fair decision. The

Respondents have sought to justify P18 on the basis that it is an independent

decision, which reflects the facts and circumstances that prevailed at the time the

decision in P18 was taken. Once a legitimate expectation is established, and is

found to be frustrated by a subsequent decision by the same authority, the

subsequent decision must be viewed in light of the first decision which gave rise to

the legitimate expectation. Therefore, the review involves two exercises of power by

the same authority, i.e. the promise, and the breach of promise, with consequences

for individuals trapped between the two.40 I am therefore of the view that the

decision in P18 cannot be viewed independent of the legitimate expectation

created by P15.

As observed above, the reason contained in P18 for the frustration of the

Petitioners legitimate expectation created by P15, is the Petitioners adverse

disciplinary record which is the AWOL incident in 2006. Subsequently, in their

39 SCFR 444/2012; SC Minutes of 30th July 2019. 40 Ex parte Coughlan (supra) at page 244; See M.R.C.C. Ariyarathne and Others v. Inspector General of Police, Police and others (supra) for a detailed discussion on this issue.

24

Statement of Objections, the Respondents attempted to justify P18 on the basis of

the Petitioners medical condition.

It is not in dispute that the Petitioner had been AWOL for 130 days in 2006. It is also

not in dispute that the Petitioner has a partial permanent disability. What is critical is

that these two factors were present (a) in 2011 when the Petitioner was promoted

as Captain (Temporary); and (b) in 2012 when P15 was issued. The Respondents

have not taken up the position that there was a change of circumstances between

P15 and P18 which necessitated and justified the departure contained in the

decision in P18.

I would not have had an issue with the said explanation if the Respondents had

stated any events that transpired after P15 that would have resulted in the change

referred to in P16, or had the Respondents at least explained the change of

circumstances after P17 that prompted the Army Selection Board No. 3 to do a 180o

degree turn for a second time in December 2017 vide P18. Much water has

flowed under the bridge since the AWOL incident in 2006, but what is important is

that the Respondents have not demonstrated that there was an incident involving

discipline or efficiency between P17 and P18 that resulted in P18. The Petitioner

has not had any disciplinary action taken against him since then, except the incident

in 2014 involving the admission of his child to the Defence College, which does not

appear to have influenced the decision, either in P16 or P18.

The position is no different with the medical condition of the Petitioner. It is not in

dispute that the Petitioner has suffered from the said medical condition since 2008,

and the Respondents have not demonstrated that the medical condition has

worsened since 2016 when P17 was issued, or that the medical condition prevents

the Petitioner from carrying out the duties entrusted to him. If the medical condition

of the Petitioner was an issue, one would expect the Petitioner to be presented

before an Army Medical Board, prior to taking any decision adverse to the Petitioner.

I have no hesitation in saying that the Sri Lanka Army has every right to reconsider

P15, where there is a change of circumstances which may warrant a re-evaluation

of the facts, or where the interests of the Sri Lanka Army demands so. However, as I

have discussed earlier, the Respondents have failed to demonstrate either of the

25

above. What is apparent here is that the Respondents have made four separate

decisions on the same facts and circumstances, with no explanation as to why the

necessity to reconsider the decision contained in P15 arose, and why the same facts

resulted in a completely contradictory decision upon reconsideration in P18.

Furthermore, when the same facts were considered for the third time, in P17, the

Commander of the Sri Lanka Army had before him, the two contradictory decisions in

P15 and P16, with reasons that influenced each of them. Thus, the decision

contained in P17 to retire the Petitioner at the completion of 20 years of reckonable

service was arrived at after giving due consideration to any factors which may have

influenced the departure from the decision in P15 contained in P16.

Thus, even if I were to take the case of the Respondents at its highest, and determine

that P18, as an independent decision, passes the test of rationality, I am of the view

that it is liable to be quashed in light of the representation made in P15, in the

absence of a change of circumstances which could warrant and/or justify the change

in course. Once a decision has been taken after deliberating on the same facts on a

previous occasion (or in this case, on multiple occasions), and represented to the

Petitioner creating a substantial legitimate expectation (P15), it would not be fair,

and would in fact be an abuse of power, if such a decision was not allowed to stand.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the decision contained in P18 is in

violation of the Petitioners legitimate expectation that he would be retained in

service until the completion of 20 years of service with due promotion, and is

therefore liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

For purposes of completeness, I shall also consider, very briefly, whether the decision

in P18, even if considered as an independent decision as claimed by the

Respondents, can be struck down for being irrational and unreasonable. The test

routinely applied to determine the reasonableness of a decision of a public authority

is set out in Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v. Wednesbury

Corporation,41 where Lord Greene defined unreasonableness as something so

absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the

authority.

41 [1948] 1 K.B. 223 at pages 229 - 230.

26

There is however growing precedence to show that English Courts have attempted to

reduce the rigour of Wednesbury unreasonableness over the years. The case of

Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough

Council,42 decided prior to the GCHQ case43 provides for what can be considered a

more balanced test:

In public law, unreasonable as descriptive of the way in which a public

authority has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has

become a term of legal art. To fall within this expression it must be conduct

which no sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities

would have decided to adopt.44

As observed above, the basis for the decision contained in P18 is the adverse

disciplinary record of the Petitioner. Although no details have been given of the said

adverse disciplinary record of the Petitioner, as noted earlier, it appears from R4

that the Board was referring to the incident where the Petitioner was AWOL in 2006.

I am not for a moment subscribing to the view that the Commander, Sri Lanka Army

is not entitled to consider the AWOL incident, even though it occurred in 2006, when

considering the confirmation of the Petitioner as Captain, but in such an event, it

would be necessary to justify the necessity to do, especially since the Petitioner had

been promoted as Lieutenant and Captain (Temporary) after the said AWOL incident.

The Respondents are required to demonstrate why more weight is now placed on

the AWOL incident to justify the retirement of the Petitioner, as opposed to when it

was considered prior to P18, or if there were any contributory factors which were

not considered by the Respondents when P15 was arrived at, that may have added

more weight to the said AWOL incident when arriving at the decision in P18.

Furthermore, in terms of Clause 3 of the Criteria for promotion/confirmation to the

rank of Lieutenant, An officer being AWOL over 21 days will not be considered for

42 Supra; page 1064. 43 Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service [1985 AC 374], where Lord Diplock defined irrationality as follows: By irrationality I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury unreasonableness. It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it. 44 The test used in Tameside was cited with approval in the case of R v Chief Constable of Sussex (Ex parte International Traders Ferry Ltd) [[1999] 1 All ER 129 at page 157].

27

promotion, unless he is pardoned by the Commander of the Army. One can only

assume that the fact that the Petitioner was considered and promoted initially as

Lieutenant, and then as Captain (Temporary), is proof that the Petitioner was

pardoned for the said AWOL incident by the Commander of the Army.

Be that as it may, in their Statement of Objections, the Respondents have provided a

completely different reason for the decision contained in P18, i.e. that the

Petitioner failed to qualify in the Annual Physical Efficiency Test during the years

2013 2016, and that he has been categorized as below average due to non-battle

reasons. Therefore, even if P18 is viewed completely independent of P15, it is

clear that the Respondents themselves were not certain as to why they were making

the decision contained in P18 to not promote the Petitioner.

In such circumstances, I am of the view that the decision in P18, even if viewed as

an independent decision as claimed by the Respondents, is not a decision that could

have been arrived at after applying ones mind to the question to be decided, and is

therefore liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari, for being irrational and

unreasonable.

In the above circumstances, I issue the Writs of Certiorari prayed for in paragraphs

(b) and (c) of the prayer to the petition. I make no order with regard to costs.
