ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an application by the Petitioner Marasinghe Mudiyanselage Pradeep

Suranga alias Banda, seeking an order from this Court enlarging him on bail. He

was arrested on 08.03.2019 by Pannala Police upon a complaint by one Rajapaksha

Appuhamilage Randika Dimithu Rajapaksha, that the Petitioner had caused injuries

by assaulting him with a spade.

The Petitioner was thereafter produced before the Magistrate's Court of

Kuliyapitiya under case No. B 59571/19 with the allegation that he had committed

an offence under Section 8(1)(b) of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of

Crime and Witnesses Act No.4 of 2015. The Petitioner was remanded by the

Magistrate's Court. Since then the Petitioner is continuing to be in remand to this

date and therefore moves this Court to enlarge him on bail under Section 10(1)(a)

of the said Act.

At the inquiry of this application, learned Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that the alleged victim had lied in making his complaint when he said

that he is yet to give evidence although he had already concluded his evidence.

The Petitioner therefore urges that this Court would consider the falsity of the

complainant's assertion as an exceptional circumstance in his favour. It is said

that the Petitioner is the sole provider for the ll-year-old girl child of his

epileptic elder brother, whose wife had deserted him due to that illness. The

Petitioner also financially supports his mentally unstable brother as well as his

ailing mother.

In view of the contention of the Petitioner that the complainant had lied, it

is helpful to make a passing reference to the factual history which led to the

lodgement of the complaint against the Petitioner.

The Petitioner is indicted along with two others before the High Court of

Kuliyapitiya in case No. 26/19 for committing murder. The complainant

Rajapaksha Appuhamilage Randika Dimithu Rajapaksha is one of the prosecution

witness in the said case and had concluded his evidence before the High Court

on 06.06.18, about nine months before this incident of assault. The complainant,

in his evidence before the High Court had implicated the Petitioner for the

murder by repeating the dying declaration of the deceased made to the former

when he visited him in the Hospital.

As to the alleged falsity of the allegation, the Petitioner had not annexed

the statement made by the complainant Randika Dimithu Rajapaksha to Police with

his Petition. Only a summary of his statement appears in the further report filed

by the Police is available annexed to the Petition. It is clear from that summary,

the Petitioner had repeatedly threatened the complainant with the utterance

3

"q@o o!ll~OO c:))cili @<;o!:Do!ll 6IC)o!:Do!ll i!)O). @C)jo o!ll~O <woO @Oo!:Do!ll tll@o!:D Ofl!JO)".

It is upon this particular portion of the statement of the complainant that the

Petitioner relies on, in order to substantiate his allegation of deliberate falsity.

On the contrary, the statement summary of the complainant is also

indicative of repeated threats of harm issued on him by the Petitioner and to his

children. It further indicate that the complainant had already given evidence

before Court. The summary of the complainant's statement also reveals that the

immediate reason for him to lodge his complaint against the Petitioner. It was

stated that due to the recent most assault, his fear of life and of his children was

renewed which made him to seek protection of law. Therefore, the difference

between the previous threats and the latest incident which led to the complaint

could easily be understood.

On previous occasions, there had only been mere verbal threats but the

recent incident had transformed those verbal threats to an actual incidence of

violence, prompting the complainant to take the threatening utterances of the

Petitioner more seriously. Suffice at this stage to conclude that the Petitioner's

claim of falsity of complaint is therefore clearly ill-founded. However, it is not for

this Court to consider the credibility of the complainant's version of events in

these proceedings, which is therefore left to the trial Court to determine.

Section 8(1)(b) of Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act No.4 of 2015 states any person;

" ... voluntarily causes hurt to a victim of crime or a witness, with

the intention of causing such victim of crime or witness to refrain

from lodging a complaint against such person with a law

enforcement authority, or testifying at any judicial or quasi-judicial

4

proceedings or to compel such victim of crime to withdraw a

complaint lodged or legal action instituted against such person, or

in retaliation for a statement made or testimony provided by such

victim of crime or witness in any court of law or before a

Commission, against such person, .. . commits an offence ... "

(emphasis added).

It is clear that the act of causing injuries to the complainant, although

occurred after he had given evidence against the Petitioner before the High

Court, is criminalised by the Section 8(1)(b) of the Act. When there is an

allegation under Section 8 of the said Act, a suspect could only be enlarged on

bail under Section 10(1)(a) of the Act and only in exceptional circumstances.

Clearly the alleged falsity of the complainant, could not be considered as

an exceptional circumstance since such allegation is clearly based upon the

Petitioner adding his own twist to the summary of the complainant's statement.

The remaining grounds urged by the Petitioner are of his personal

circumstances. In the judgment of The Queen v Camelis Silva 74 NLR 113, it was

stated that the grounds that are "common to many accused persons" will not

qualified to be considered as exceptional. This restrictive approach, in relation to

consider whether a particular set of circumstances are as exceptional, is

continued as indicative from the judgment of Attorney General v Ediriweera

[2006] BLR 12, where the Supreme Court has held;

"exceptional circumstances only exist, when the facts and

circumstances of the case are such that they constrain or

5

impel the Court to the conclusion that justice can only be

done by granting of bail, .. . ".

Therefore, these personal circumstances as urged by the Petitioner, though

entitled to sympathy of this Court, fail to satisfy the requirement as imposed on

him by Section 10(1)(a) of Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act No.4 of 2015, making him entitle to be enlarged on bail.

The application of the Petitioner is therefore refused and his Petition is

accordingly dismissed.
