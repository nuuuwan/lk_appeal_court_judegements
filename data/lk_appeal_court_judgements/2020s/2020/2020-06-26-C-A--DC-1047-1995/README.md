N. Bandula Karunarathna J.

The Plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff)

instituted the present action to obtain the dQclaration of title in respect of the land

referred to in paragraph 2 of the plaint. The Plaintiff in her plaint set out her

pedigree and stated that she became the owner of the land in dispute as stated in

the plaint.

The Defendant Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Defendant) in

her answer denied the averments in the plaint and sought the dismissal of same

and as a claim in reconvention, sought a declaration that she is the owner of the

land referred to in lot 6 of the plan 1038 of the Licensed Surveyor Anton

Samararathna.

Thereafter the case was fixed for trial on 10.05.1995 and on that day the trial of the

case was re-fixed on personal grounds of the Attorney-at-law of the Defendant.

Thereafter the case was fixed for trial on 10.11.1995.

The factual setting to this case is as follows;

On that day (10.11.1995) when this matter was fir'st called in the morning for trial

the Defendant was absent. However as per the proceedings of that day Attorney-

at-Law for the Defendant Mr. A.J.P.M. Jayawardana had informed Court that he has

no instructions from the Defendant.

In the circumstances, at that time the case has been fixed ex-parte against the

Defendant and had kept down the matter to be taken up for trial subsequently. As

per the case record when the case was again called for the trial around 10.25 am,

the Defendant appeared before Court and there was no representation for the

Defendant.

However as per the proceedings of the day it had been recorded that, the

Defendant had not made any application. Thereafter the Plaintiff had given

evidence in chief and it ha~ been recorded after the examination in chief, no cross

examinations from the Defendant.

In the meantime, the Lec;lrned District Judge has cut the word e2:i)OJti~eJ2:i) by one

line as seen from the journal entry No. 17 dated 10.11.1995 at page 16 of the brief

and had left only the balance part namely 25')~ eJroJ(l)",,8 (l)Z5f25')J c~. After the

evidence in chief of the Plaintiff on 10.11.1995 it is recorded that 1S)6~ Sai25') lfl,,s :

Thereafter the Plaintiff had closed his case leading in evidence documents P1 to P5

and then the Learned District Judge had reserved the judgment for 27.11.1995. The

judgment was again postponed to 29.11.1995 and on that day the Learned District

Judge had delivered the judgment.

The Defendant had tendered the notice of Appeal against the said judgment and

had sought to call the matter in the open Court to support the filing of the said

notice of Appeal.

Thereafter the case was called on 22.01.1996 and on that day both parties had

submitted to the Court that the trial was taken up on 10.11.1995 ex-parte against

the Defendant and thereafter the ex-parte judgment had delivered and the

Defendant had sought from Court to consider the judgment as a ex-parte judgment

and wanted to take steps accordingly to serve the decree on the Defendant etc.

After hearing both parties however the Learned District Judge on 02.02.1996

delivered the order and submitted that this is the judgment delivered inter-parte

and directed the parties to take steps accordingly.

However, in the meantime the Plaintiff had submitted the Plaintiff Appeal on

26.01.1996. This is in order to file the petition in time. If the Defendant had to wait

until the order is delivered. In this regard the Learned District Judge the filing of the

petition Appeal would have been out of time.

The main standpoints of the Plaintiff, are as follows;

The Plaintiff in her evidence marked '0(.01' the commission plan relating to the

identification of the corpus. The Plaintiff states that the Plaintiff's title was derived

from a partition decree which was marked 'ol.02'. In the said partition decree lot

No.6 of the final scheme was allocated to the 4 th Defendant of the case named

Page 3 of7

Peella Kamkanamge Emaliya alias Ema Nona. The said Ema Nona by deed marked

'01.04' transferred 22.6 perches of lot No. 6 to Pushpa Chandrani Karunarathna

who is the Plaintiff of the instant action. Thereafter the remaining 10.04 perches of

lot No. 6 was transferred by the said Emaliya to Plaintiff by the deed marked '01.05'.

By the deeds marked '01.04' and '01.05' the Plaintiff became the title holder of lot

4 of the partition plan marked '01.03'.

The Plaintiff in her evidence stated that the Defendant without any right, title or

interest to the said land is in illegal occupation since 28th September 1988 and

pleaded for the relives as prayed for in the Plaint.

The Plaintiff states that the Defendant in her answer claimed prescriptive title to

the said lot 06 but has not listed any document to substantiate the purported

prescriptive title. (the said list is also being filed out of time and in contrary to the

section 121 of the Civil Procedure Code).

The Plaintiff further states that the Learned Trail Judge has to consider evidence

and enter the judgment in terms of section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code which

requires a concise statement of the case, the points of determination, the decision

and reasons.

The Plaintiff states that when analyzing Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code it

is clear that the term 'the points of determination' must be there in the judgment.

It is submitted that the points of determination do not mean to set up issue since

framing of issues arises only when there is a contest between the parties.

The Plaintiff states that in the instant case the Learned Trail Judge has clearly set

up the points of determination as whether the Plaintiff entitled for the declaration

of title, eviction and damages. The term 'points of determination' by no mean

refers to framing of issues. Framing of issues is referred in Section 146(2) of the

Civil Procedure Code which refers to as 'the issues shall refer to the points that are

not agreed by the parties. Further Section 146 (3) refers as no issues are required

when the Defendant makes no defence. In the instant action even though the

Defendant filed an answer she did not maintain any defence at the trail which

comes within the ambit of Section 146(3) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Page 4 of7

Therefore, the Plaintiff submits that the Learned Trail Judge has acted within the

scope of the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code in deciding the matter which is

in conformity with the Section 146(3) and 187.

Subsequent to a thorough analysis of the facts of the case, it is pertinent to note

that originally as per the journal entry of 10.11.1995, the case has been fixed ex-

parte against the Defendant as the Defendant was absent and the counsel for the

Defendant had informed Court that he had no instructions to appear before Court

on behalf of the Defendant. When the case called around at 10.25 am the

Defendant was present and the counsel was not present. The Defendant had not

made any application as per the Learned District Judge on that day. Whether the

Learned District Judge has given an opportunity to the Defendant to cross 'examine

the Plaintiff is in question.

In any event, cutting off the word "~ 2S) oJz;f~tl 2S)" from the journal entry

fundamentally changes the case.

Once the counsel had informed that he has no instructions from the Defendant,

the Learned District Judge had taken up the case ex-parte against the Defendant.

It is important to note that once the case is fixed ex-parte against the Defendant

there was no reason available for the counsel to stay and watch what is happening

in the case. Therefore, the counsel has left the Court after informing that he had

no instructions from the Defendant. In the circumstances one cannot expect that

the counsel would wait in Court to look after the interest of the Defendant once

the case was fixed ex-parte against the Defendant.

The Learned District Judge by cutting the word "~2S)oJ z;f~tl 2S)" from the journal

entry would have intended to take the case inter-parte subsequently.

It is doubtful as to why the Learned District Judge would take the case inter-parte

once the order is made in the presence of the counsel of the Defendant, to take the

matter ex-parte against the Defendant.

It is also relevant to note that by cutting off the word "~2S)oJz;f~tl2S) by the Learned

District Judge and subsequently the matter is taken up inter-parte is serious

Page 5 of 7

prejudice to the rights of the Defendant and the case has been taken up without

any legal representation on behalf of the Defendant.

I therefore concede that the Defendant may have been prejudiced by the act of the

Court and in fact there is a miscarriage of justice.

In NANDANA v ATTORNEY-GENERAL 2008 (1) SLR 51, it was held that

the trial Judge has committed a very serious and fundamental misdirection of law

by attaching a burden on the defence to rebut the prosecution evidence, and due

the flimsy nature of the evidence and due to the long lapse of time since the date

of the incident, ordering a retrial would not meet the ends of justice.

In K. J. M. EDWIN Vs. K. L. D. A. DE SILVA 62 NLR 44 too, a retrial was ordered

and the justification for the same is as follows;

The judgment of a judge of first instance written after the impression created by

the witnesses has faded is not of the same value to the appellate court as a

judgment written while that impression is fresh. We accordingly quash all the

proceedings on and after 19th June 1956 and remit the record with a direction

that the case be reheard.

In WIJESENA SILVA AND OTHERS v. ATTORNEY GENERAL 1998(3) SLR 309,

It was held that for all purposes even in a retrial which is no different from the

first trial every provision of law applicable to any trial before a High Court would

be mutatis mutandis applicable at a retrial

Therefore, I reiterate that the Learned District Judge by striking off words would

have meant to take the case inter-pClrte subsequently. The Learned District Judge

has no right whatsoever to take the case inter- parte once the order is made in the

presence of the coun5el of the Defendant to take the matter ex-parte against the

Defendant. Therefore,the Defendant has not been afforded an equal opportunity

Page () of 7

to present his case. Owing to the aforesaid reasons, my viewpoint is that the

Learned District Judge erred in law by ordering an ex parte judgment.

We accordingly set aside the judgment and direct a retrial.

Considering the circumstances, we make no order for cost.

The learned District Judge of Galle is further directed, to give priority and conclude

this matter as this case is fairly an old case.
