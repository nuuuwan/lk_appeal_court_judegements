Argued on: 30.06.2020

Decided on: 23.07.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Admittedly, the Petitioners land was acquired, in accordance

with the proper procedure under the Land Acquisition Act, for

the construction of the Central Expressway, and compensation

was awarded to the Petitioner following the acquisition.

The Petitioner has filed this application mainly against the

Minister of Lands and the Minister of Highways and Road

Development, seeking to compel them by mandamus to (a) divest

the said land and (b) enhance compensation, on the basis the

land is not being used for the public purpose it was acquired for

and is instead being used by a sports society as a volleyball

court.

The said two reliefs are irreconcilable; they are not sought in the

alternative.

Be that as it may, according to the statements of objections of

the Respondents, the construction of the Central Expressway is

4

underway, and a part of the land acquired from the Petitioner

has been given to the said sports society as a temporary

measure until an alternative land is identified for them. The

Respondents have tendered a spate of documents to establish

that the public purpose for which the land was acquired has not

changed and the area used at present as the temporary

volleyball court will be used to construct the proposed office

buildings of the Central Expressway.

The Petitioner cannot seek divestiture under section 39A of the

Land Acquisition Act. In order for a divesting claim to be made

under section 39A, the Petitioner shall satisfy four criteria. The

first criterion is no compensation has been paid under the Act to

any person or persons interested in the land in relation to which

the said divesting Order is to be made. Admittedly, the

Petitioner received compensation without any protest.

Therefore, he cannot in law make a claim for divestiture.

The Petitioner admittedly did not appeal against the award of

compensation in the manner set out in Part III of the Land

Acquisition Act; nor did he appeal to the special tribunals

created for this purpose, i.e. the Land Acquisition Resettlement

Committee (LARC) and the Super Land Acquisition Resettlement

Committee (Super LARC). He says he did not do so as a

responsible citizen. Then he cannot now move this Court to

enhance the quantum of compensation. This is not the task of

the writ Court.

Both reliefs sought by the Petitioner are plainly misconceived in

law.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with costs.
