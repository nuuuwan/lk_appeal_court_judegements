The petitioner in that case had sought an interim order preventing the said Policy being applied to him. This Court, having considered the fact that the respondents had not provided any rationale for the introduction of the said policy and that too only in respect of those who had been absent without leave prior to 20th May 2009, issued an interim order staying the operation of P16 in so far as it related to the petitioner in that application.",
