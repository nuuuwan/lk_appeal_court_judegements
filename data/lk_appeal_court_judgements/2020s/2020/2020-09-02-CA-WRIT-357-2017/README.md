Respondents.

Argued on: 15.07.2020

Decided on: 02.09.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner submitted a building plan for a proposed house

consisting of two basement floors, a ground floor and two upper

floors to the 4th Respondent Pradeshiya Sabha for approval. The

land is in an Urban Development area coming under the Urban

Development Authority. The 3rd Respondent, the Director

(Central Province) Urban Development Authority, granted

approval by P9 for the Petitioners plan, subject to conditions.

The third condition reads as follows:

1986.03.10 "# + -. 34(2) / 5

7 : <= ?@@ @ C 7

@ 03 F GH (B3+G) K# LMN. +H

P . QRS + F ?@@ U 20 F #

LM.

According to this condition, the Petitioner could build three

basement floors and a ground floor, with the height of the

building not exceeding 20-feet from the ground-level to the roof-

top of the building.

This is confirmed by paragraph 14 of the statement of objections

of the 4th and 5th Respondents, the Pradeshiya Sabha and its

Secretary, quoted below:

The characters B3+G that comes in the said 3rd condition

means 3 Basements and the Ground Floor, in a building the

Ground Floor is existing above all the Basements of it, and

accordingly the total height of all the Basements has to be

got rid of and the described 20 feet have to be measured

from the level of the Ground towards the Top of the roof of

the building.

It is clear from the third condition in P9 that the 20-foot height

limit is imposed to prevent any obstruction to the view of the

property owners of the neighborhood. Such an obstruction,

according to the 3rd Respondent, violates regulation No.34(2)

made by the Minister under the Urban Development Authority

Law marked P10. Regulation 34 reads as follows:

CONSERVATION OF PLACES OF HISTORICAL,

ARCHITECTURAL INTEREST OR LANDSCAPE VALUE

34(1) If any premises or area or monument not covered by

the Antiquities Ordinance is in the opinion of the Authority,

of historical or architectural interest, the Authority may give

directions as it deems fit for the conservation of such

buildings, groups of buildings, area or monument as the

case may be.

6

(2) If any premises or area, in the opinion of the Authority is

of scenic or landscape interest, the Authority may give

directions as it deems fit for the conservation and

maintenance of such premises or area as the case may be.

In my view, the 3rd Respondent could not, relying on regulation

34(2), impose the said height limit on the basis the view of the

adjoining landowners would be obstructed if the building is

constructed higher than 20-feet from the ground-level.

Regulation 34(2) serves a different purpose. It attempts to

preserve premises or areas, whichin the opinion of the Urban

Development Authorityare of scenic or landscape value; it is not

concerned with the view of adjoining landowners. By 1R1 it is

clear this height limit was imposed due to a complaint by the

property owner who is on the other side of the road. However,

the name of such owner has not been disclosed nor has such a

complaint been produced before this Court.

Having been dissatisfied with the said condition, the Petitioner

appealed to the 2nd Respondent, the Chairman of the Urban

Development Authority, and the 7th Respondent, the subject

Minister. As a result, the Petitioner was formally called before

the Main Planning Committee of the Urban Development

Authority and allowed to make a PowerPoint presentation in

pursuance of his appeal.

The decision of the Main Planning Committee of the Urban

Development Authority, as contained in 1R1, is as follows:

Committee has decided to approve the clearance only for

G+3 (Maximum height as per the regulations) from the

existing ground level of the proposed land.

7

The 3rd Respondent accordingly amended the third condition in

P9 by P13. The amended third condition as per P13 reads as

follows:

?@@ @ C V WX. +H P GH

V @ 03 (G+3) F K# LMN.

However, before the Petitioner tendered the amended building

plan prepared in accordance with P13, the 3rd Respondent

arbitrarily amended P13 by P16 to have the third condition read

as follows:

1986.03.10 " # + -. 34(2) / 5

7 : <= ?@@ < @ C

GH V @ 03 (G+03) F K # LM ,

7 +H P . QR F ?@@ U 20

K# LM.

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash P16 by

certiorari.

The 4th and 5th Respondents in paragraphs 19 and 20 of the

statement of objections admit: (a) by P16 the 3rd Respondent

reversed the decision of the Main Planning Committee of the

Urban Development Authority marked P13; (b) P16 is

unacceptable, as a building with a ground floor and three upper

floors cannot practically be constructed with a maximum height

limit of 20-feet from the ground-level. I totally agree.

In the same breath, I totally disagree with the standpoint of the

1st-3rd and 6th Respondents taken in paragraph 8(ix) of their

statement of objections that although P16 states the third

condition in P13 has been amended, in actual fact the condition

8

remains unchanged. If this is the position of the said

Respondents, P16 is redundant and can be withdrawn, and the

Petitioner can withdraw this application, as the only relief

sought by the Petitioner is to quash P16 leaving P13 intact.

I agree with learned Counsel for the Petitioner when he says that

by P16 the 3rd Respondent re-imposed the maximum height limit

of 20-feet from the road-level, which was removed by the Main

Planning Committee of the Urban Development Authority on

appeal.

As I stated earlier, regulation 34(2) is inapplicable in this

context. Furthermore, a ground floor and three upper floors

cannot practically be built without exceeding the 20-foot limit

from the ground-level to the roof-top of the building.

The 3rd Respondent had no authority to amend the appeal

decision of the Main Planning Committee of the Urban

Development Authority. The decision of the 3rd Respondent, as

reflected in P16, is arbitrary and ultra vires. I quash the

decision by way of a writ of certiorari. I also direct the

Respondents by way of a writ of mandamus to comply with the

appeal decision contained in P13.

The reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (c)-(f) of the prayer to the

petition are granted.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs.
