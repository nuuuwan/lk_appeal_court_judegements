Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This case is connected to CA/WRIT/279/2018, in which the

Judgment was delivered today.

The legal issue in both matters is identical; the only difference is

this matter is in respect of the high land whereas the connected

matter is in respect of the paddy land.

Both matters were argued together, and all parties agreed to

abide by the decision in CA/WRIT/279/2018.

Vide the Judgment delivered in CA/WRIT/279/2018 today.

Accordingly, the application of the Petitioner is allowed with

costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.
