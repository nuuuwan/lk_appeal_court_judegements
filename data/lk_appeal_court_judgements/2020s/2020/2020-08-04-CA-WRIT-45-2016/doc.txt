Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner is the Chief Incumbent of the Pathmawathi Pirivena Viharaya

(the Viharaya) situated in Keragala. The Petitioner states that the said Viharaya

which was earlier known as the Keragala Tampita Viharaya has a long history,

with an archaeological heritage. The Petitioner states further that the Viharaya

has been in existence even before the Dambadeniya period, and that it was

established as a Buddhist educational institution during the Kotte period.

The Petitioner states that the land adjacent to the North-West and North of

the Viharaya is known as Danawkanda Watta and had been part of the

Viharaya property, and had been used for the activities of the Viharaya. The

Petitioner states further that during the Colonial period, private parties had

acquired lands belonging to the Viharaya including Danawkanda Watta and

that the said land became the property of private individuals.

The Petitioner admits that with the introduction of the Land Reform

Commission Law No. 1 of 1972, as amended (the LRC Law), the said

Danawkanda Watta had been vested in the Land Reform Commission and

had been taken over by the Land Reform Commission. The said land had

subsequently been vested with the 5th Respondent, the Janatha Estates

Development Board in terms of Section 27A(1) of the LRC Law, and has been

leased to the 7th Respondent, Kurunegala Plantation Company Limited for a

period of 53 years, in November 1995.

The Petitioner states that he became aware that the Land Reform Commission

is seeking to alienate 69 acres of Danawkanda Watta to the petitioners in CA

(Writ) Application No. 1072/2009, and that he intervened in the said

application to prevent the alienation of the said land to a private party, and to

4

protect the said land as an archaeological heritage site. Pursuant to the said

intervention, the Department of Archaeology had undertaken an assessment

of the archaeological monuments that exist on Danawkanda Watta. Its

report, annexed to the petition marked P1 sets out that 17 archaeological

monuments have been identified on the said land. The said report goes into

state as follows:

Pursuant to the submission of the report P1, the Department of Archaeology

had informed the Hon. Attorney General, inter alia that:

Thus, even as at 2009, the Petitioner had no claim to the said land known as

Danawkanda Watta, except the interest on the part of the Petitioner to

preserve the said land for its archaeological heritage and importance.

In 2013, the Director General of Archaeology has recommended by his letter

marked P5 that the land surrounding the temple be handed over to the

temple as there is evidence that the said land forms part of an old nindagam

land. The Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs had thereafter sent the

letter marked P6 to the Land Reform Commission informing that the land

area around the temple be handed over to the temple as the said land had

vested in the Land Reform Commission by an oversight. The Director General

of Archaeology had also informed the Land Reform Commission by letter

marked P7 as follows:

The Land Reform Commission had thereafter taken a decision that

Danawkanda Estate must be handed over to the Petitioner and requested the

Petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 306,410/- being the equivalent of the

compensation that the Land Reform Commission had paid the statutory

declarant in 1982. I must note at this point that the fact that the Petitioner was

asked to pay the said sum of money establishes the fact that the decision of

the Land Reform Commission to hand over the said land to the Petitioner was

not taken on the basis that the land had been vested in it by mistake, but as

admitted by the Petitioner in his counter affidavit, on the basis that the said

land is suitable to be handed over to the Petitioner, in view of the

archaeological significance referred to earlier.

2 A copy of the said Gazette has not been produced to this Court.

6

Thereafter, the Land Reform Commission had directed the 7th Respondent, by

letter dated 30th March 2015, marked P12 to handover the said land to the

Petitioner, which the 7th Respondent had not complied with. It is only

thereafter that the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, seeking

inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Land Reform Commission to act in

accordance with the letter marked P12;

(b) A Writ of Mandamus directing inter alia the Janatha Estates Development

Board, and the 7th Respondent to act in accordance with the said letter

marked P12.

The conditions that must be satisfied for a Writ of Mandamus to issue have

been clearly set out over the years in several judgments. The Supreme Court in

Ratnayake and Others vs C.D.Perera and others3 has held that:

The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public

authority to do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command

issued by the superior Court for the performance of public legal duty.

Where officials have a public duty to perform and have refused to

perform, Mandamus will lie to secure the performance of the public duty,

in the performance of which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. It is

only granted to compel the performance of duties of a public nature, and

not merely of private character that is to say for the enforcement of a

mere private right, stemming from a contract of the parties.

The above position has been reiterated in Jayawardena vs. Peoples Bank4

where it was held as follows:

3 [1982] 2 Sri LR 451.

7

Courts will always be ready and willing to apply the constitutional

remedy of mandamus in the appropriate case. The appropriate case must

necessarily be a situation where there is a public duty. In the absence of a

public duty an intrusion by this Court by way of mandamus into an area

where remedial measures are available in private law would be to

redefine the availability of a prerogative writ.

In Credit Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferjee & Jafferjee (Pvt)

Ltd5 J.A.N. De Silva J. (as he was then) held as follows:

"There is rich and profuse case law on mandamus on the conditions to be

satisfied by the applicant. Some of the conditions precedent to the issue of

mandamus appear to be:

(a) The applicant must have a legal right to the performance of a legal

duty by the parties against whom the mandamus is sought (R. v

Barnstaple Justices. The foundation of mandamus is the existence of

a legal right (Napier Ex parte).

(b) The right to be enforced must be a "Public Right" and the duty sought

to be enforced must be of a public nature.

(c) The legal right to compel must reside in the Applicant himself (R. v

Lewisham Union)

(d) The application must be made in good faith and not for an indirect

purpose.

4 [2002] 3 Sri LR 17. 5 [2005] 1 Sri. L.R. 89 at 93.

8

(e) The application must be preceded by a distinct demand for the

performance of the duty.

(f) The person or body to whom the writ is directed must be subject to

the jurisdiction of the Court issuing the writ.

(g) The Court will as a general rule and in the exercise of its discretion

refuse writ of Mandamus when there is another special remedy

available which is not less convenient, beneficial and effective.

(h) The conduct of the Applicant may disentitle him to the remedy.

(i) It would not be issued if the writ would be futile in its result.

(j) Writ will not be issued where the Respondent has no power to

perform the act sought to be mandated."

In Rajeswari Nadaraja v. M. Najeeb Abdul Majeed, Minister of Industries and

Commerce and Others6 Aluwihare, J has held that, In an application for a writ

of mandamus, the first matter to be settled is whether or not the officer or

authority in question has in law and in fact the power which he or she refused

to exercise. As a question of law, it is one of interpreting the empowering

statutory provisions. As a question of fact, it must be shown that the factual

situation envisaged by the empowering statute in reality exists.

The issue that this Court must determine in this application is therefore

twofold. The first is, as a question of fact, whether Danawkanda Estate is

Temple land and therefore excluded from the definition of Agricultural Land.

The second is, as a question of law, whether the Land Reform Commission can

6 SC Appeal No. 177/15; SC Minutes of 31st August 2018.

9

exercise any authority over lands which were vested in it, once an Order has

been made under Section 27A(1) and while such Order subsists, or in other

words, whether it has the power in terms of the law to direct the 7th

Respondent to hand over the said land to the Petitioner.

Prior to considering the above two issues, it would be useful to lay down the

provisions of the LRC Law that are relevant to this application. The LRC Law is

the first law enacted under the First Republican Constitution of 1972 by the

National State Assembly, and came into operation on 26th August 1972. In its

long title, the said Law was stated to be a "Law to establish a Land Reform

Commission, to fix a ceiling on the extent of agricultural land that may be

owned by persons, to provide for the vesting of lands owned in excess of such

ceiling in the Land Reform Commission, and for such land to be held by the

former owners on a statutory lease from the Commission, to prescribe the

purposes and the manner of disposition by the Commission of agricultural lands

vested in the Commission so as to increase productivity and employment, to

provide for the payment of compensation to persons deprived of their lands

under this Law and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.

With the introduction of the LRC Law, agricultural lands owned by any person

in excess of the ceiling stipulated in the LRC Law vested with the Land Reform

Commission, by operation of law.7 However, in view of the definition of

Agricultural land in Section 66, lands belonging to Viharas and Devalas

(together referred to as Temples) were excluded from the provisions of the

LRC Law.

At the time the LRC Law was introduced, in addition to private individuals who

owned land, there were several companies, commonly known as Sterling

7 Vide Section 3(2) of the LRC Law.

10

companies and Rupee Companies that owned large extents of agricultural

land on which predominantly tea and rubber had been cultivated. The principal

enactment did not apply to such lands and the reason for such exclusion has

been set out in the speech delivered in Parliament on 10th October 1975 by

Hon. Hector Kobbekaduwa, the then Minister of Agriculture and Lands, when

he presented the amendment to the LRC Law to include lands owned by such

companies.8 Part IIIA to the LRC Law titled Special Provisions relating to estate

lands owned by public companies was introduced by the Land Reform

(Amendment) Law No. 39 of 1975, to address the nationalisation of such

lands.9

In terms of Section 42A (1) of the LRC Law, Every estate land10 owned or

possessed by a public company shall, with effect from the coming into

operation of Part IIIA,11 (a) be deemed to vest in and be possessed by the

Commission ; and (b) be deemed to be managed under a statutory trust for and

on behalf of the Commission by the agency house or organization which was

responsible for, and in charge of, the management of such estate land on the

date of such vesting

Similar provision with regard to agricultural lands is found in Section 3(2), with

the former owner being referred to as the Statutory lessee.

8 Hansard of 10th October 1975 (Columns 1448 1459): On that occasion (i.e. when the LRC Bill was presented in 1972) the House will remember that we excluded from the operation of this Law, lands belonging to public companies, both foreign and local lands belonging to religious and charitable trusts. We had very good reasons for excluding those lands, particularly lands belonging to public companies, because of precarious foreign exchange at that time. 9 Part IIIA consists of Sections 42A 42M. 10 Estate land has been defined in Section 42M to mean, any land of which an extent exceeding fifty acres, is under cultivation in tea, rubber, coconut or any other agricultural crop, or is used for any purpose of husbandry, and includes unsold produce of that land and all buildings, fixtures, machinery, implements, vehicles and things, movable and immovable, and all other assets belonging to the owner of such land and used for the purposes of such land. 11 The date is 17th October 1975.

11

The effect of such vesting of agricultural land has been set out in Section 6 of

the LRC Law, which reads as follows:

Where any agricultural land is vested in the Commission under this Law,

such vesting shall have the effect of giving the Commission absolute title

to such land as from the date of such vesting and, free from all

encumbrances.

Similar provision in respect of estate lands is found in Section 42A(2) of the LRC

Law. Thus, whether it be agricultural land or estate land, once vested, it

conferred on the Land Reform Commission, absolute title in such land.

It is noted that in terms of Sections 15 and 42B of the LRC Law, while the land

remains vested with the Land Reform Commission, the statutory lessee or the

statutory trustee, as the case may be, is responsible for the management of

the agricultural or estate land,12 and the statutory lease or trust shall continue

for one year from the date of vesting. If the Land Reform Commission so

decides, the period can be continued for a further period of one year. No

statutory lease or trust may be continued for any further period by the Land

Reform Commission, except with the express approval of the Minister.

Thus, in terms of the LRC Law, agricultural lands owned by any person in excess

of the ceiling, and estate lands owned or possessed by a public company were

deemed to be vested with the Land Reform Commission. Until such time a

suitable entity was identified to manage the said lands, the management was

to remain with the individual or company that owned such land on the basis of

a Statutory Lease or Trust, subject to the said period being limited to two

12 Section 42B(1) reads as follows: Where any estate land is vested in the Commission under section 42A, the statutory trustee of such estate land, shall, during the continuance of such statutory trust, be responsible for the good and proper management of such estate land, subject to such general or special directions as may from time to time be issued by the Commission.

12

years. Thus, the role of the Land Reform Commission was as a repository of

lands that vested with the State in terms of the LRC Law, and as a custodian of

such lands until inter alia suitable persons were identified to manage the said

lands or the lands were alienated in accordance with the LRC Law.

Sections 22(1) and 42H(1) have specified the purposes for which the

agricultural and estate lands so vested with the Land Reform Commission may

be used. This includes the alienation of the said lands to the Sri Lanka State

Plantations Corporation established under the Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation Act No. 4 of 1958 or to any corporation established or to be

established under the State Agricultural Corporations Act No. 11 of 1972.13 The

Janatha Estates Development Board is the public corporation that was

established for the said purpose, in terms of an Order made under Section 2(1)

of the State Agricultural Corporations Act No. 11 of 1972.14 In terms of the said

Order, the Janatha Estates Development Board has been entrusted with the

power, inter alia, to manage agricultural and estate lands. It is not in dispute

that in keeping with the nationalisation policy of the then Government,

management of the said estate lands as well as certain agricultural lands had

been handed over to the Janatha Estates Development Board, and the Sri

Lanka State Plantations Corporation.15

The next important amendment to the LRC Law was effected by the Land

Reform (Amendment) Act No. 39 of 1981, by the introduction inter alia of

Section 27A consisting of four sub-sections.

13 Vide Sections 22(1)(g) and 42H(1)(c). 14 The said Order has been published in the Gazette of 6th February 1976. 15 In 1975, the Rupee and Sterling companies were nationalized, with Agency Houses continuing as trustees. Thereafter in 1976, these were turned over to the two largest State-owned plantation agencies, namely, the Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB) and State Plantations Corporation (SPC); https://www.historyofceylontea.com/ceylon-publications/ceylon-tea-articles/the-evolution-of-sri-lankas-plantation-sector.html.

13

Section 27A(1) reads as follows:

At the request of the Commission, the Minister may, where he considers

it necessary in the interest of the Commission to do so, subject to sections

22, 23 and 42H, by Order published in the Gazette, vest, in any State

Corporation specified in the Order, with effect from a date specified in

that Order, any agricultural land or estate land or any portion of the land

vested in the Commission under this Law, and described in the order,

subject to such terms and conditions relating to consideration for the

vesting of that land in such Corporation as may be agreed upon between

the Commission and such Corporation.

Acting in terms of Section 27A(1) of the LRC Law, the Minister of Agriculture

Development and Research has made an Order in terms of Section 27A of the

LRC Law, read together with Section 42H thereof. The said Order has been

published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 230/12 dated 2nd February 1983,

marked R2. Thus, in terms of Section 27A(1) of the LRC Law, the agricultural

and estate lands referred to in the Schedule to R2 including Danawkanda

Estate in extent of 262.8H vested with the Janatha Estates Development

Board.

The consequences of an Order made under Section 27A(1) has been set out in

Section 27A(2), which reads as follows:

An Order under subsection (1) shall have the effect of vesting in such

State Corporation specified in the Order such right, title and interest to

the agricultural land or estate land or portion thereof described in that

Order, as was held by the Commission on the day immediately preceding

the date on which the Order takes effect.

14

The provisions of Section 27A(3) leaves no room for any ambiguity when it

states as follows:

Where any agricultural land or estate land or any portion thereof is

vested in a State Corporation by an Order made under subsection (1), all

the rights and liabilities of the Commission under any contract or

agreement, express or implied, which relate to such agricultural land or

estate land or portion thereof, and which subsist on the day immediately

prior to the date of such vesting, shall become the rights and liabilities of

such State Corporation.

The above provisions reflect the intention of the legislature that the rights and

liabilities of the Land Reform Commission in respect of any agricultural or

estate land, together with the absolute title that the Land Reform Commission

had to such lands shall pass to the Janatha Estates Development Board, with

the making of an Order under Section 27A(1).

With the publication of the said Order R2, the Land Reform Commission

ceased to be the owner of all the agricultural and estate lands referred to

therein, and in terms of Section 27A(1) of the LRC Law, the said lands referred

to in the Schedule to R2 vested with the Janatha Estates Development Board,

and the title to the said lands stood transferred to the Janatha Estates

Development Board effective from the date of such Order.

It is not in dispute that even though the objectives sought to be achieved by

the LRC Law was laudable,16 its implementation vis-a-vis the management of

the lands did not achieve the desired results. The enormous losses that were

16 Speech by Hon. Hector Kobbekaduwa in presenting the Land Reform (Amendment) Bill on 10th October 1975 We tried to embody in cold print, by placing a ceiling on the ownership of land, our will and determination to redistribute the vast acres of land that were concentrated in the hands of a few people in this country.

15

incurred by the Janatha Estates Development Board and the Sri Lanka State

Plantations Corporations in managing the lands resulted in the decision in 1992

to privatise the estate sector.17 This process was effected by incorporating

plantation companies in terms of an Order made under Section 2(2) of the

Conversion of Public Corporations or Government Owned Business

Undertakings into Public Companies Act No. 23 of 1987, as amended (the

Conversion Act), and handing over the management, movable property,

contracts, agreements, employees, liabilities, current assets etc of the estates

specified in such Order to the relevant company. The Order relating to the 7th

Respondent, marked R3 enabled the 7th Respondent to take over the

functions and business specified in Part I in respect of the estates referred to in

Part II of the Schedule to R3, including Danawkanda Watte which formed part

of Attanagalle Estate. The Janatha Estates Development Board had thereafter

executed the lease agreement marked R4a in favour of the 7th Respondent in

respect of the Attanagalle Estate that had been vested in the Janatha Estates

Development Board by virtue of the Order marked R2.

The issue that has given rise to this application has arisen in view of the

definition of Agricultural Land in Section 66 of the LRC Law. The relevant

portions of the said definition are re-produced below:

agricultural land means land used or capable of being used for

agriculture within the meaning given in this Law and shall include private

lands, lands alienated under the Land Development Ordinance or the State

Lands Ordinance or any other enactment ... but shall exclude-

17 Vide report of the Asian Development Bank on the Plantation Reform Project, December 2004.

16

(b) any such land which was viharagam or devalagam land on May 29,

1971, so long and so long only as such land continues to be so owned

or possessed;

(e) any such land held in trust on May 29, 1971, under the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance so long and so long only as such land is held

in trust under that Ordinance.

Thus, it is clear that lands belonging to Viharas, Devalas and Temples (together

referred to as Temples) which was viharagam or devalagam land on May 29,

1971 have been excluded from the applicability and scope of the LRC Law and

that such lands could not have (a) vested in the Land Reform Commission, or

(b) come under the control of the Land Reform Commission.

An issue however arose with regard to temple lands which had been leased by

such temples (a) to private individuals who in turn had declared the said lands

in their statutory declarations, or (b) to a public company. Whether lands

owned by Temples but possessed by public companies vested in the Land

Reform Commission in terms of Section 42A was considered by this Court in

Land Reform Commission vs. Ganegama Sangarakhitha Thero.18 The facts of

that case briefly are as follows. The plaintiff as Trustee of Budulena Raja Maha

Vihara, Pelmadulla, filed action against the Land Reform Commission, seeking

a declaration of title to the land called Lellopitiya Estate, in extent of 213A 1R

21P, which the Budulena Temple had leased out to a Public Company, namely

L.L.P. Estates Company Limited for a period of fifty years from 1st January 1934.

The plaintiff, while alleging that the Land Reform Commission took possession

of this land on 1st November 1975 illegally and unlawfully, also prayed for

damages and ejectment of the Land Reform Commission. The Land Reform

18 [1987] 2 Sri LR 411.

17

Commission admitted that it took over possession of the land in dispute, but

resisted the action on the basis that in terms of the Land Reform (Amendment)

Law No. 39 of 1975, the land in dispute which formed a part of a larger estate

of 1882A, 1R and 29P, possessed partly as owner and partly as a lessee by

L.L.P. Estates Co. Ltd., vested with the Land Reform Commission. The learned

District Judge gave judgment in favour of the plaintiff. On an appeal by the

Land Reform Commission, the question that arose for the consideration of this

Court was whether the land in dispute, admittedly owned by the Budulena

Raja Maha Vihara, of which the plaintiff was the trustee, and possessed by

L.L.P. Estates Company Limited, a public company as a lessee from the temple,

vested with the Land Reform Commission by operation of the Land Reform

(Amendment) Law No. 39 of 1975.

This Court, having considered in detail the provisions of the LRC Law, held that:

(a) The word possessed in the term 'owned or possessed in section 42A

carries the same meaning attached to it in Section 66 and refers to the

possession of a deemed owner;

(b) Viharagam' or devalagam land owned or possessed by a religious

institution and land held in trust under the Buddhist Temporalities

Ordinance for so long as such land is held in trust under that Ordinance -

all as at 29th May 1971 - are excluded from the definition of agricultural

land in Section 66;

(c) The disputed land is part of the temporalities of the Budulena Raja Maha

Vihara and is excluded from the operation of the Land Reform Law by

virtue of the exclusions contained in clauses (b) to (e) in Section 66.

18

In the light of the above legal and factual background, I shall now consider

whether Danawkanda Estate is Temple land and if so, in view of the definition

of Agricultural Land in Section 66 of the LRC Law, whether Danawkanda

Estate could not have vested in the Land Reform Commission, and therefore

should be handed over to the Petitioner.

In paragraph 5 of the petition, the Petitioner has stated that, the adjacent

land to the North West and North of the said Temple, known as Danawkanda

Watte alias Danawkanda was earlier part of the temple property with great

archaeological values and had been used for the purpose of activities of

Pathmawathie Pirivena during pre-colonial period.

The Petitioner goes onto state in paragraph 6 of the petition that, this

Pirivena had been subjected to attack and destruction by the Portuguese and

British during the Colonial period and subsequently acquired by private parties

as a result of which greater parts of the land belong(ing) to the said

Pathmawathie Pirivena including the said Danawkanda Watta land became a

property of private individuals.19 Thus, even if it is accepted that the said land

formed part of a nindagam given to the said Viharaya, on the Petitioners own

admission, the said land has been acquired by private parties during the

Colonial period, and was not part of the Viharaya on the all important date of

29th May 1971.

I shall now consider the manner in which Danawkanda Watte came to be

vested with the Land Reform Commission. In its Statement of Objections, the

Land Reform Commission has stated that in a statutory declaration made in

terms of Section 18 of the LRC Law marked 1R1, Mrs. E.L.I. Ranamuni had

declared Danawkanda Estate as being an agricultural land belonging to her in

19 This position has been reiterated in paragraph 2(iii) of the Counter Affidavit.

19

excess of the ceiling stipulated by the LRC Law. The Land Reform Commission

has stated further that the physical possession of the said land was taken over

by it, a fact which has been admitted by the Petitioner.

By a notice published in terms of Section 29 of the LRC Law in Extraordinary

Gazette No. 321/2 dated 12th June 1978, marked 1R2, the Land Reform

Commission had called for claims for compensation in respect of the land

declared by Mrs. Ranamuni. According to the Land Reform Commission,

neither the Petitioner nor his predecessors had any objection on behalf of the

Viharaya at the time the said land was taken over by the Land Reform

Commission on 27th June 1974, nor did the Petitioner or his predecessor

respond to 1R2. Compensation had accordingly been paid to Mrs. Ranamuni,

as there were no other claims.

The Land Reform Commission states that while an extent of 50A 2R 20P was

set apart from Danawkande Estate for Mrs. Ranamuni, the balance extent of

67A 3R 21P was taken over by the Land Reform Commission and subsequently

vested with the Janatha Estates Development Board, vide R2. Even though

the said extent out of Danawkande Estate had been vested with the Janatha

Estates Development Board, Land Reform Commission had taken steps to

exchange the said land with the declarant of Rathgammana Estate as part of a

settlement in CA (Writ) Application No. 1072/2009, at which point the

Petitioner intervened against the handing over of the said land on the basis

that the said land contained several monuments of archeological value.

Even though the Department of Archaeology and the Commissioner General of

Buddhist Affairs have stated that the said land is temple land, and the

Petitioner too has stated so in his counter affidavit, the 7th Respondent has

categorically denied that the said land was ever a part of the property of the

Viharaya. The learned Senior State Counsel has drawn the attention of this

20

Court to the report of the Presidential Commission on Buddhist Temporalities,

marked R1 which considered the issue of Temple land being vested by

mistake in the Land Reform Commission, and to the fact that Danawkande

Watte is not one of the lands referred to, therein. Nor is there any specific

reference to Danawkande Watte in the documents filed by the Petitioner with

his affidavit of 21st September 2016. While this Court cannot determine any

questions relating to title, if the Petitioner is of the view that title to

Danawkanda Watte is with the Viharaya, the proper course of action would be

for the Petitioner to pursue its title in a Court of competent jurisdiction.

Taking into consideration the totality of the material presented to this Court,

the aforementioned averments in the petition, together with the statutory

declaration filed by Mrs. Ranamuni it is clear that the Viharaya was not the

owner of the said land on the relevant date i.e. 29th May 1971, nor was the

said land in the possession of the Viharaya on that date.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that: (a) Danawkanda Watte was not a viharagam or devalagam land on May 29,

1971;

(b) Therefore, the said land comes within the definition of Agricultural Land

and has vested with the Land Reform Commission in terms of the LRC

Law;

(c) Absolute title in the said land has been vested in the Janatha Estates

Development Board, in terms of R2;

(d) As the Land Reform Commission does not have absolute title to the said

land consequent to the publication of R2, the Land Reform Commission

is functus and cannot exercise any control in respect of the said land, nor

21

can it direct the Janatha Estates Development Board or the 7th

Respondent to hand over the said property to the Petitioner;

(e) Any interference by the Land Reform Commission with the rights of the

Janatha Estates Development Board and the 7th Respondent over such

land is illegal and ultra vires the powers of the Land Reform Commission.

Applying the proposition laid down by the Supreme Court in Rajeswari

Nadaraja v. M. Najeeb Abdul Majeed, Minister of Industry and Commerce

and Others20 to the facts of this application, I am of the view that the

Petitioner has not satisfied either the question of law or the question of fact

that must be satisfied in order to succeed in this application. In the above

circumstances, I see no legal basis to grant the relief prayed for. The

application of the Petitioner is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
