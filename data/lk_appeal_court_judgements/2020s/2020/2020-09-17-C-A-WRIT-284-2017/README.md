S.C., for the 1st-3rd Respondents.

Argued on: 23.07.2020

Decided on: 17.09.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The services of the 5th Respondent employee were terminated by

the Petitioner employer on 13.06.2016. The 5th Respondent filed

a case in the Labour Tribunal on 25.09.2016 seeking:

(a) reinstatement or

(b) reasonable compensation in lieu of reinstatement

(c) costs of the action and

(d) any other reliefs the Labour Tribunal deems fit.

In the meantime, the 5th Respondent also complained to the

Commissioner of Labour about this dispute vide P10. The

Commissioner referred the dispute to the subject Minister, who,

in terms of section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, referred

the same for settlement by arbitration vide P17 and P18. This

was done by the Minister after the institution of the case in the

Labour Tribunal.

The question referred for settlement by arbitration is:

Whether Mrs. U.M.C.L. Fernando [the 5th Respondent] who

worked at Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation

Limited Sri Lanka [the Petitioner] as a senior Manager had

been caused injustice by not being paid the pension fund

which is paid under the Defined Contribution Scheme when

an employee is terminated from employment, and if so, to

what reliefs she is entitled.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by

certiorari the said decision of the Minister to refer the dispute for

settlement by arbitration.

5

The main ground upon which the Petitioner bases this

application is, when the dispute is sub judice in the Labour

Tribunal, the Minister cannot refer the same or part of it for

arbitration.

The 5th Respondent counters this argument by stating that the

dispute referred for arbitration is distinctly different from the

dispute presented before the Labour Tribunal.

I am afraid, I cannot agree. The alleged two disputes are

intrinsically interwoven.

The complaint of the Petitioner to the Labour Tribunal is that

the termination of her services was unjustifiable. On that basis,

she seeks reinstatement or compensation and any other reliefs.

The subsequent reference for arbitration admits the termination

of employment but questions the non-payment of the pension

fund.

The said two disputes are irreconcilable, in that, in the dispute

presented before the Labour Tribunal, the 5th Respondent

disputes the termination, but in the dispute referred for

arbitration, the Petitioner accepts the termination but disputes

the denial of the benefits she claims she is entitled to. She

cannot claim the benefits of the pension fund without first

accepting the termination of employment.

On the other hand, the dispute referred for arbitration is

meaningless if the Labour Tribunal directs reinstatement on the

basis that the termination of the 5th Respondent is unjustifiable.

If the Labour Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the

termination is unjustifiable, but decides, instead of

6

reinstatement, to grant the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs

(b) and (d) of the prayer to the application filed before the Labour

Tribunal, which I quoted above, the Labour Tribunal can also

address the issue referred for arbitration.

Without drawing attention to any of these matters, the Minister

has simply made a general referral of the matter for arbitration.

This, in my view, will lead to conflicting or overlapping decisions

by both the Labour Tribunal and the Arbitrator on the same

dispute.

In Eksath Kamkaru Samithiya v. Upali Newspapers Ltd. [2001] 1

Sri LR 105 at 107-108, the Supreme Court, whilst dismissing the

appeal filed against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal, held:

The only matter urged by counsel on behalf of the employer

at the hearing in the Court of Appeal was that the Minister

had no power to refer a dispute for settlement by arbitration

in terms of section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act while

applications in respect of the same dispute were pending in

the Labour Tribunal. The Court of Appeal held as follows:

The combined effect of the provisions of Interpretation

Article 170, Articles 114 and 116 is that the decision in

Wimalasena v. Navaratne and others (1978-79) 2 SLR 10,

can no longer be considered as valid authority for the

proposition that the Minister has unlimited powers under

section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act which would

enable him to refer a dispute which is pending before a

Labour Tribunal to an Arbitrator for settlement. Such an

interpretation would necessarily infringe and violate the

principle of the independence of the judiciary enshrined in

Article 116 of the Constitution which is paramount law...I

7

see no reason to interfere with the finding of the Court of

Appeal. I accordingly hold that the Court of Appeal has not

erred in the interpretation of Article 116(1) of the

Constitution and that the Minister had no power to refer the

dispute regarding the termination of services for compulsory

arbitration when applications in respect of the said dispute

were pending in the Labour Tribunal.

Whilst it was submitted on behalf of the 5th Respondent that the

aforesaid Supreme Court decision is distinguishable from the

instant case, it was submitted on behalf of the 1st Respondent

Minister that the said decision is per incuriam. I reject both

submissions. The Judgment of the Supreme Court, which is

binding on this Court, is in accordance with sound legal

principles and common sense.

It is my considered view the referral for arbitration by the

Minister is ultra vires. Hence I quash the said decision by

certiorari.

In view of this, there is no necessity for me to consider the other

arguments advanced on behalf of the Petitioner.

I grant the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (b), (c) and (e) of

the prayer to the amended petition dated 21.07.2020.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs.
