The Petitioner-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) by application dated 08/08/2014, filed an action against the

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) in terms

of Section 28A (3) of the Urban Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 (as

amended) in the Magistrates Court of Mahara, to demolish a development activity

commenced contrary to Section 28A (I) of the Act in an area declared as an Urban

Development area under Gazette Notification No. 1225/30, dated 0110312002, in

terms of Section 3 of the Act.

In the proceedings before the Magistrates Court, the Appellant failed to

show cause as to why the relief prayed for by the Respondent should not be

granted. The learned Magistrate having been satisfied with the application filed

before Court, by order dated 13/02/2015, granted relief in favor of the Respondent

as prayed for. The Appellant thereafter filed a revision application against the said

order in the Provincial High Court of Gampaha, inter-alia, challenging the' locus

standi' of the Respondent to file and maintain this action in the Magistrates Court.

The learned High Court Judge by order dated 23/1112016, rejected the objection

on maintainability of the said application and dismissed the application for want of

exceptional circumstances. The Appellant is before this Court to revise the said

order.

Page 30f9

When this case was taken up for argument the Counsel for the Appellant

raised the following grounds of appeal.

I. The Respondent has no 'locus standi' to file and maintain the said

application in the Magistrates Court.

2. Gazette bearing No.122S/30, dated 01/03/2002 has no application to the

Appellant's premises in question, since the development activity was

carried out prior to the declaration of the area as an urban development

area.

The same grounds of appeal were raised in the Provincial High Court as

well.

The application before the Magistrates Court was filed by the Chairman of

the Mahara Pradeshiya Sabhawa. The Appellant raised objection to 'locus standi'

of the Respondent, in the Provincial High Court on the basis that by document

marked "@o 3" tendered to the Magistrates Court, it was the Secretary of the

Mahara Pradesiya Sabhawa who was delegated the power to institute action and

not the Chairman of the said Pradesiya Sabhawa. Therefore, the Appellant

contends that the Respondent has no 'locus standi' to file and maintain the case in

the Magistrate Court of Mahara, since there is no delegation of power to the

Chairman of Mahara Pradeshiya Sabha to institute action. The Appellant argued

that, when the issue of ' locus standi' was raised in the High Court, the Respondent

Page 40f9

tendered to Court a document delegating power to the Chairman of the Pradeshiya

Sabhawa marked "v i", in terms of Section 23(5) of the Act.

The position of the Respondent is that the Appellant did not challenge the

proceedings before the Magistrates Court, however, since the objection to 'locus

standi' was raised, the letter delegating power in terms of the law to the Chairman

of the Pradeshiya Sabhawa, was tendered to the Provincial High Court.

The Appellant questions the authenticity of the letter delegating power

marked "v I" on the basis that it bears the same file number and the date as the

letter of delegation of power to the secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabhawa tendered

to the Magistrates Court. However, there is no evidence before Court to doubt the

genuineness of the said document.

When the application under Section 28A (3) was filed in the Magistrates

Court, on 3 occasions the Appellant failed to show cause and defend her position.

Accordingly, after having served notice on the Appellant to comply with the

requirements of the law, and having been satisfied that the Appellant had not

complied with the requirements specified in such notice, the learned Magistrate

made order to demolish the unauthorized construction.

When 'locus standi ' of the Respondent to institute action was questioned

by the Appellant in the proceedings before the Provincial High Court, the

Respondent tendered document marked "v I ", which delegated power to the

Page 5 of9

chairman to institute action against the Appellant. Document "t) 1 ", makes it clear

that the said delegation was made prior to the institution of the action.

Section 23 (5) of the Urban Development Authority Law (as amended),

provides as follows;

"The Authority may delegate to any offlcer of a local authority in consultation

with that local authority, any of its powers, duties and functions relating to

planning, within any area declared to be a development area under Section 3, and

such officer shall exercise, perform or discharge any such power, duty or

functions so delegated, under the direction, supervision and control of the

Authority. "

"The provisions contained in Section 28A (3) fall within the scope of the term

"planning" and therefore the powers, duties and functions referred to therein

could be delegated by the UDA to any officer of a local authority. " (M.P. Selvam

Vs. K.B. Perera (SC Appeal No. 123/09) decided on 18/0112012)

In the present case, the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabhawa was delegated

power to institute action against the Appellant by letter dated 0 I /08/2008, in

compliance with the statutory provisions of the law. Therefore, we do not see any

illegality in the application dated 08/08/2014, entertained by the learned

Magistrate to comply with the exercise of jurisdiction in terms of Section 28A (3)

Page 6of9

of the Law. Accordingly, the 1

51 ground of appeal is without merit and should be

rejected.

Section 28A (I) of the Urban Development Authority Law, as amended,

provides for the procedure to be followed in respect of development activities

commenced contrary to the terms and conditions of a permit; that is,

(a) to cease such development activity forthwith; or

(b) to restore the land on which such development activity is being executed or

has been executed, to its original condition; or

(c) to secure compliance with the permit under the authority of which that

development activity is carried out or engaged in, or with any term or

condition of such permit, and for the purposes of compliance with the

requirements aforesaid,

(i) to discontinue the use of any or building; or

(ii) to demolish or alter any building or work.

Accordingly, Section 28A (I) has laid down the procedure to be followed,

where any development activity commenced continued, resumed or completed

without a permit or contrary to any term or condition set out in a permit issued,

pertaining to a development activity.

The Respondent relied on Urban Development Authority Vs. H. W.

Kulasiri (CA 2226/2003), where Gamini Amarathunga J. held that,

Page 70f9

----

"in a situation where an application made under Section 28(A) (3) of the UDA

Law had been made the relevant question is whether the structure in question has

been erected upon a valid permit. The existence of a permit is the only valid

answer to the application under Section 28(A) (3). The burden of showing that the

construction had been done on a valid permit is on the person noticed. "

The Appellant argued that, she was resident in the house in question from

year 2000, which is prior to the declaration of the area as an urban development

area. However, the letter issued by the Grama Sevaka certifies that the Appellant

was residing in the said premises since 2002. (Vide page 57 in brief, marked

"oIT). The electricity bills marked "OIS" and "oI9" also reveals that the

Appellant came into occupation in 2002.

The Intervenient-Petitioner-Respondent is affected by the unauthorized

construction since an imminent risk exist of a wall collapsing on the residence of

the said Respondent if the demolition order is not enforced. Several letters written

to the Appellant by the Pradesiya Sabhawa confirms this position. The sketch

depicting the unauthorized building is tendered as document marked "Ols" (Vide

page 54 of the brief).

The Mahara Pradeshiya Sabha area was declared as an urban development

area under Gazette Notification Bearing No. 1225/30, dated 01/03/2002. (Vide

page 52 of the brief, marked "oI4" ). In terms of the law a person involved in

Page 8 of9

constructing a building should have a valid permit and the said construction should

be in conformity with stipulated terms and conditions. In the instant case, the

Appellant has failed to produce any approved building plan or a valid permit for

the construction of the house in question. For the aforesaid reasons, we do not see

any merit in the 2nd ground of appeal as well.

In view of the above findings, we affirm the orders given by both Courts

and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 15,0001-.

Dr. Ruwan Fernando, J.

I agree.
