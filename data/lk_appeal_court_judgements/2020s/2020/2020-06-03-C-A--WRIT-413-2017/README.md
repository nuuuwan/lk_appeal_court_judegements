Argued On: 19.03.2019

Written Submissions Filed On:

Petitioner on 10.06.2019 and 16.12.2019

Respondents on 17.10.2019

Decided On: 29.05.2020

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is a Superintendent of Excise in the Excise Department. At all times materials to

this application the Petitioner was attached to the Superintendent's office in Ampara. In

addition, he was acting as Superintendent of Excise-Batticaloa.

By letter dated 10.08.2017 (P1S) the Petitioner requested the 1st Respondent to transfer him

permanently to the Batticaloa office as it was vacant. The 2nd Respondent by letter dated

22.09.2017 (P17) informed that the request cannot be granted at that point of time.

The Petitioner then submitted a detailed appeal dated 20.10.2017 (P18) to the 1st Respondent.

By letter dated 31.10.2017 (P19), the 1st Respondent informed the Petitioner that his request

cannot be accommodated since a Superintendent of Excise had been appointed to the

Batticaloa office with the approval of the Public Service Commission (PSe).

Upon further representations made by the Petitioner (P21) the 1st Respondent again refused

the request made by the Petitioner (P22).

Although the Petitioner has sought several reliefs in the petition, on 19.03.2019 when this

application was taken up for argument, the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner

informed that he is limiting the relief claimed to prayers C, D and F of the petition which reads

as follows:

C. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus, directing the 3rd

to 12th Respondents, constituting the Public Service Commission, to duly

consider and to thereafter, OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE the Petitioner's requests

for transfer to Batticaloa, dated 10.08.2017 and/or the Appeal submitted in this

regard dated 20.10.2017, produced marked as P1S and P18 strictly according to

law, including principles of Administrative Law and due process and the Rule of

Law;

D. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st

Respondent to forthwith forward to the Public Service Commission, all

documents and necessary files and also the Petitioner's appeals and all requests

made by him for transfer to Batticaloa, in order to facilitate DUE

CONSIDERATION AND OBJECTIVE DETERMINATION of the same, strictly in

accordance with the law, by the 3rd to 12th Respondent as constituting the

Public Service Commission,

F. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari, quashing the

decision and/or decisions ofthe 1st Respondent, as reflected in

I. the letter dated 31.10.2017 marked P19,

II. the letter dated 02.11.2017 marked P22.

Power of Transfer

In terms of Article 55(1) of the Constitution, the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary

control and dismissal of public officers is vested in the PSc. The PSC is empowered in terms of

Article 57(1) of the Constitution to delegate to a public officer its powers of, inter alia, transfer

of such category of public officers as are specified by the PSC.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor contended that the power of transfer in relation to the

Petitioner has been delegated by the PSC to the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance (R14). The

learned President's Counsel for the Appellant contended that what has been delegated to the

Secretary is limited to making transfers in terms of annual transfer schemes and that all other

powers pertaining to transfer is retained with the psc. This submission is based on the Scheme

of Transfer (R15).

I am not inclined to accept this proposition. The relevant column in R14 reads "Transfer

according to schemes approved by the Public Service Commission". Transfer is not limited to

annual transfers. But all transfers must be in accordance with a scheme of transfer approved by

the PSc. This is further corroborated by clause 02. of the Scheme of Transfer (R15) which states

that "all transfers will be done by the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance and Planning

according to schemes of transfer approved by the PSC". Merely because the PSC has not

approved a scheme of transfer does not mean that the Secretary is not vested with the power

of transfer. He has the power but cannot exercise it in the absence of an approved scheme of

transfer.

Therefore, I hold that the power of transfer of the Petitioner was delegated by the PSC to the

Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning. However, in the present case, the 1st Respondent

has sought to exercise it by Pig and P22 and thereby acted without jurisdiction. Hence the

decisions contained letters dated 31.10.2017 (Pig) and 02.11.2017 (P22) are ultra vires.

Article 61A of the Constitution

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General contended that Article 61A of the Constitution

ousts the jurisdiction of this Court to grant any relief in relation to the writs of certiorari sought

by the Petitioner.

I am of the view that this constitutional objection to the writ of certiorari must fail.

Undoubtedly, Article 61A of the Constitution is a constitutional ouster and can therefore oust

the jurisdiction of this Court created by Article 140 of the Constitution. But it does not cover a

situation where the decision maker was not exercising any power delegated by the PSc. This

was the application of Article 61A that was resorted to by Marsoof J. in Ratnasiri ond Others v.

Ellawala and Others [(2004) 2 SrLL.R. 180 at 196] when he held:

"In this context, it is relevant to observe that although it is common ground that 1st to

3rd Respondents are public officers, there is no evidence to establish that they have

been delegated any authority by the Public Service Commission under Article 56 or 57 of

the Constitution. This is important in the context of Article 61A of the Constitution as it

only seeks to shut out the jurisdiction of court with respect to any order or decision

made by a Committee of the Public Service Commission or any public officer, "in

pursuance of any power or duty ... delegated to a Committee or public officer, under this

Chapter or under any other law."

Accordingly, I issue writs of certiorari quashing the decision and/or decisions of the 1st

Respondent, as reflected in the letter dated 31.10.2017 marked P19 and the letter dated

02.11.2017 marked P22.

Writ of Mandamus

This leaves the question of writ of mandamus sought by the Petitioner to be considered. Here

again the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General contended that Article 61A of the

Constitution ousted the jurisdiction of this Court to grant the writs of mandamus sought for by

the Petitioner.

Page 70f9

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner countered by contending that he is not

calling in question any order or decision made by the PSC, which is what according to him is

prohibited by Article 61A of the Constitution, but seeking relief in the form of a writ of

mandamus to compel the PSC to consider and determine the request for transfer made by the

Petitioner in law. He relied on K. T.S.N. De Silva and Others v. Salinda Dissanayake, Minister af

Land and Minor Agricultural Export Produce and Others [(2003) 1 SrLL.R 52]. Further reliance

was placed on (1) Koravito ond Others and (2) Welikanna v. Inspector General of Police and

Others [(2002) 2 Sri.L.R. 287], K.G.C. Priyadarshini v. Cammissioner General af Inland Revenue

and Others [CAWA 540/2011, C.A.M. 29.06.2012], Sisil Wijitho ond 27 Others v. N.K.

IIIangakaon, Dr, Dayasiri Fernando, Chairman, Public Service Commissian and 12 Others [CAWA

75/2013, C.A.M. 13.03.2018].

While reserving my position on whether a writ of mandamus can be granted where the PSC has

not taken any decision, this mater can be decided on another fundamental ground.

It is trite law that to issue a writ of mandamus there must be a public or statutory duty. [De

Alwis v. De Silva (71 N.L.R. 108); Weligama Multi Purpase Caoperative Society Ltd. v.

Chandradasa Daluwatte (1984) 1 SrLL.R. 195; Hakmana Multi Purpose Cooperative Society Ltd.

v. Ferdinando (1985) 2 SrLL.R. 272; Piyosiri v. Peoples Bonk (1989) 2 SrLL.R. 47; Sannasgalo v.

University of Kelaniya (1991) 2 SrLL.R. 193; Samaraweera v. Minister of Public Administration

(2003) 3 SrLL.R. 64]

In view of my conclusion that the power of transfer of the Petitioner has been delegated to the

Secretary, Minister of Finance and Planning, there is no statutory or public duty on the PSC to

consider and objectively determine the transfer application of the Petitioner.

There is another reason why the prayer for the writ of mandamus must fail. It is trite law that

for mandamus to lie, the administrative body must be called upon to perform the public or

statutory duty which it has failed to perform. In other words there must be a demand and

refusal [per Sripavan J. (as he was then) in Kahandawelo v. Notionol Housing and Development

Authority ond Another (2004) 2 SrLL.R. 176 at 180].

For all the foregoing reasons, the application is partly allowed to the extent specified above.

Parties shall bear their costs.
