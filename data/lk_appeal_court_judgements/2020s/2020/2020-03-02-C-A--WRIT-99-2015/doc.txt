HON. JUSTICE ACHALA WENGAPPULI

The Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Trust Association, through its

power of Attorney Holders acting as the three joint Petitioners, invoked

the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by Article 140 of the Constitution

in filing this application by which they seek relief primarily by way of

issuance of a Writ of Mandamus against Chairman, Ambalangoda

Pradeshiya Sabha (1st Respondent) and Secretary of the said Pradeshiya

Sabha (2nd Respondent) and the Divisional Secretary of Ambalangoda (4th

Respondent) to pay Rs. 8,80,000.00 for the acquired land as per the Notice

3

03-2010 under Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, official interest and

delay charges.

It is stated by the Petitioners that Lot 1 and 2 of the Surveyor

General's Plan No. 2574 dated 01.12.1994 which depicts a part of Lot No.1

in Plan No. 746 surveyed on 18.05.1963 has been acquired on behalf of the

1st Respondent for the purpose of building a crematorium under its

management in 1997, by the 4th Respondent who acted as the Acquiring

Officer under the provisions of Land Acquisition Act No.9 of 1950.

After the acquisition, possession of the said land was handed over to

the 1st Respondent, who constructed a crematorium on it. The Petitioners

claim that during the inquiry under Section 9 of the said Act, they sought

compensation from the 4th Respondent. They also state that after a lapse of

12 years and after the said inquiry under Section 9, the 4th Respondent had

published the required notice under Section 10(1)(a) of the said Act on

28.09.2009 and the 4th Respondent, consequent to his determination under

Section 17 of the said Act, declared that the Petitioners are entitled to Rs.

8,80,000.00 as compensation for the land that had been acquired for the 1st

Respondent. This determination was duly communicated to the 1st

Respondent by the 4th Respondent by his letter dated 23.04.2010, marked

as 4R5.

Thereafter, the 4th Respondent had, in a series of correspondence

with the 1st Respondent directed the Pradeshiya Sabha to deposit the

already decided quantum of compensation in his office. The 1st

Respondent however, had informed the Petitioners that there is a

significant disparity of the land prices at the time of actual acquisition and

4

now. It also stated that since it had already deposited the required amount

it cannot make another payment as compensation. This position had been

communicated to the 4th Respondent as well and he had called for proof of

the claim of the 1st Respondent, since there was no official record available

in his office about such a payment.

The Petitioner sought intervention of the 3rd Respondent, the

Presidential Secretariat, Hon. Member of Parliament for Galle District,

Department of Christian Religious Affairs and District Secretary without

any success in their claim of compensation. The 4th Respondent had

directed the 1st Respondent to deposit the required funds for the payment

of compensation by letters marked as P6/4R6, P8, 4R7 and P12. The

Petitioner had requested the 1st Respondent to make available the required

funding by letters marked as P9, and PlO(c) but failed to elicit any

response from the 1st Respondent.

The 2nd Respondent, having raised two preliminary objections to the

maintainability of the petition of the Petitioners in his objections, admitted

that after identifying a suitable land for the cemetery, the 1st Respondent

initiated the acquisition process. As per the valuation of the Valuation

Department, which was conveyed to the 1st Respondent by letters dated

02.03.1984 and July 1985 (2R2 and 2R3), a sum of Rs. 17,600.00 was

indicated. Acting upon the said valuation, the 1st Respondent had

deposited Rs. 20,000.00 with the Divisional Secretary on 28.02.1987 (2R4,

2R5, 2R6,2R7,2R8 and 2R9) and the said payment was confirmed by the

receipt dated 19.02.1987 (2R10). The 2nd Respondent further stated that the

1st and 2nd Respondents have acted according to law and there is no failure

5

on their part in discharging of any legal obligations and had therefore

prayed for dismissal of the petition of the Petitioners.

In this objection, the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents have stated that

Survey Department had prepared a Plan bearing No. 2574 of 07.08.1995,

an admits that the land described in the petition of the Petitioners

corresponds to the cumulative area in Lots 1, 2 and 4 of the said Plan. The

3rd , 4th and 5th Respondents further stated that consequent upon a request

by the 1st Respondent, notice, as required under Section 38(A) of the Land

Acquisition Act, was published in Gazette No. 7415/11 of 16.11.1992.

Thereafter, the 4th Respondent had taken over the possession of the said

land and it was subsequently determined under Section 17 of the said Act

that the Petitioners are entitled to be paid a sum of Rs. 8,80,000.00 as

compensation. The quantum of compensation was determined upon the

valuation of the Chief Valuer, who informed the 4th Respondent by his

letter dated 11.03.2010 that the value of compensation for the land that had

been acquired is estimated at Rs. 8,80,000.00 (4R4). The 1st Respondent was

thereafter instructed to make the compensation amount available to the 3rd

Respondent. It is also stated by the 3rd Respondent that the 3rd to 5th

Respondents have taken steps according to law and thereby sought that

the petition of the Petitioners be dismissed.

The Petitioners, have relied on the statutory provisions contained in

Section 29 of the Land Acquisition Act, in support of their application for

the issuance of a Writ of Mandamus. They submitted that there is a

statutory duty cast on the acquiring officer by virtue of Section 29 of the

Land Acquisition Act to pay compensation to "each person who is entitled

to compensation" which the 4th Respondent had failed to comply.

6

It is clear from the respective positions taken up by the parties in

their pleadings, there is no dispute to the fact that the land belonged to the

Petitioners was acquired by the 4 th Respondent on behalf of the 1st

Respondent. It is also not disputed that the Petitioners are entitled to be

paid compensation upon acquisition of their land by the 1st Respondent.

The contentious issue is the quantum of compensation that is payable to

the Petitioners. The 2nd Respondent claims that the 1st Respondent had

already deposited Rs. 20,000.00 and thereby fulfilled their part of the

obligation. It is clear from the annexures to the objections of the 2nd

Respondent that Ambalangoda Pradeshiya Sabha never made any payment.

The deposit of Rs. 20,000.00 was made, upon the funds released from the

Decentralised Budgetary allocation of a Hon. Member of Parliament, who

represented the area at that point of time.

The Petitioners and the 3rd to 5th Respondents claimed that the

quantum of compensation had been determined as Rs. 8,80,000.00 by the

4th Respondent and the 1st and 2nd Respondents have failed to release or

deposit the said sum of money with the 4th Respondent who is the

designated authority to pay compensation as the Acquiring Officer.

Before this Court ventures to consider the submissions of the

contesting parties, it is pertinent to consider the two "preliminary

objections" raised by the 2nd Respondent.

The first of the objections was the Petitioner's failure to name

Ambalangoda Pradesheeya Sabha as a party necessary to the determination

of the instant application. The second objection related to the failure of the

7

Petitioners to name holder of the office of Secretary of the Ambalangoda

Pradeshiya Sabha.

In dealing with the objection as to the failure to name necessary

parties, the 2nd Respondent cited several authorities where this Court had

treated the failure to name a necessary party as fatal to the maintainability

of the application. The judgments in Ravaya Publishers and Others v

Wijedasa Rajapaksha, Chairman, Sri Lanka Press Council and Others

(2001) 3 Sri L.R. 213, Abayadeera v Dr. Stanley Wijesundara, Vice

Chancellor, University of Colombo (1983) 2 Sri L.R. 267 and CA

Application 178/2012 - decided on 09.08.2012, have all taken the consistent

view that the failure to name necessary parties are fatal to the respective

applications.

When an objection is taken with regard to the failure to name a

necessary party to an application, the Courts would then decide any such

objection by applying a test in determining whether a particular party is a

necessary party or not in that particular instance. In Ravaya Publishers

and Others v Wijedasa Rajapaksha, Chairman, Sri Lanka Press Council

and Others (ibid), it was held by J.A.N. de Silva J (as he was then);

"In the context of writ applications, a necessary party is one

without whom no order can be effectively made. A proper

party is one in whose absence an effective order can be made

but whose presence is necessary to a complete and final

decision on the question involved in the proceedings."

The Petitioner had made the Chairman of the Preadeshiya Sabha as

the 1st Respondent and the Secretary of the said Sabha as the 2nd

8

Respondent. In this particular situation, the pivotal issue is the failure of

the said Sabha to deposit the required sum of money with the 4th

Respondent to be payable to the Petitioners after determination as per

Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act. The Petitioners have therefore

sought a Writ of Mandamus against the Acquiring Officer, citing him as the

4 th Respondent in addition to the 1st and 2nd Respondents. In the event of

this Court issuing a Writ of Mandamus on these Respondents, they should

comply with that order. Once the Court issues an order, the relevant

Respondent must comply. There is no question of Pradeshiya Sabha

making a determination whether to comply with the order of Court or not

as it did with the determination of the 4th Respondent. There is no decision

making process that is involved with the Pradeshiya Sabha, in complying

with an order of Court. Hence, the relevant Pradeshiya Sabha is not a

necessary party , in tha t context.

The Petitioners have rightly sought a Mandamus against the 4th

Respondent since he is the Acquiring Officer who is statutorily duty

bound to pay compensation. Similarly, they also sought a Mandamus on

the 2nd Respondent to provide the necessary finances to the 4th

Respondent, if this Court decided to issue the Writ on him. Once the 4th

Respondent had determined the amount of compensation, particularly the

2nd Respondent as the Chief Administrative Officer of the relevant

Pradeshiya Sabha ( as per Section 9(2) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15

of 1987), is under a similar public duty to make available the necessary

funding, in fulfilment of the 4th Respondent's statutory duty. In that

context, even if the Pradeshiya Sabha is cited as a respondent either as a

legal entity or by adding each member of the Sabha as individual

9

"

Respondents, that fact would not make any difference and therefore fails

to satisfy the above reproduced requirement in identifying it as a

necessary party,

However, the 2nd Respondent did not proceed with his 2nd

preliminary objection at the hearing of this application, It is sufficient to

refer to Rule No. 5(2) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules

1990, wherein it is provided that a " ... public officer may be made a

Respondent to any such application by reference to his official designation

I " on y ....

It appears that the 2nd Respondent primarily based his argument on

the document marked 2R2. In this letter addressed to the Designated

Officer of Batapola District Development Council, the local Government

body that preceded Pradeshiya Sabhas, which were established by Act

No.15 of 1987, the Chief Valuer informs that his "preliminary assessment"

for the purpose of acquisition of the land for a cemetery is Rs. 17,600.00. He

further emphasises in that letter itself that the said valuation is not a final

assessment. The 4th paragraph of the said letter reiterates the fact that the

final assessment will be forwarded to the Acquiring Officer once the initial

steps in the process of acquisition had commenced and the Surveyor

General prepares the Plan.

The Chief Valuer conveyed his final valuation to the 4th Respondent

by his letter dated 11.03.2010 (4R4) and therein the land that had been

acquired was valued at Rs. 8,80,000.00, Acting upon the said final

valuation, the 4th Respondent had determined that the Petitioners are

entitled to compensation quantified at Rs. 8,80,000.00.

10

When the predecessor of the AmbaJangoda Pradeshiya Sabha

deposited Rs. 20,000.00 in fulfilment of the requirement to commence

preliminary stages of the process of acquisition of Petitioner's land, it had

taken upon itself of the legal consequences that flow from that point

onwards. The 2nd Respondent's submission that it is the duty of the 4th

Respondent to obtain necessary funds to pay compensation to the

Petitioners from the now defunct Galle District Development Council

could not be accepted as a valid proposition in view of clear provisions

that are contained in Section 16(3) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act where it

states that all assets and liabilities acquired or incurred by a Development

Council in the exercise of its local Government powers with respect of a

Pradeshiya Sabha area is vested in the said Sabha after the appointed date.

Since there was no challenge to this determination made by the 4th

Respondent under Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, it is therefore

incumbent upon the 1st and 2nd Respondents to comply with the

determination made by the 4th Respondent.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner invited the attention of this Court

to the judgment in CA (Writ) Application 512/2011, decided on 05.09.2019

on almost identical factual setting. In this judgment it is revealed that the

Petitioner sought a Writ of Mandamus on the Acquiring Officer, who

disclosed to Court that the land was acquired on behalf of State Timber

Corporation and the delay of payment of compensation was due to the

failure of the said Corporation to deposit the sum mentioned in the award

made under Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act.

11

Upon this revelation, this Court granted relief to the Petitioner by

issuing a Writ of Mandamus, whilst stating that;

"Clearly the dispute as to the payment of compensation is

between the 2"d and 3rd Respondents, one an agent of the

State and the other a public Corporation for whom the land

was acquired. I am of the view that such an internal issue

cannot deprive the Petitioner what it had been awarded

according to law. It is the duty of the State to ensure that

resources are available to comply with awards made under

Section 17 of the Act. The failure to do so cannot deprive the

Petitioner of what is due according to law."

In relation to the instant application too, this Court finds that the

inordinate delay was a result of the dispute between the Ambalangoda

Pradeshiya Sabha and the 4th Respondent upon the former's failure to

deposit the sum awarded by the latter as the Acquiring Officer acting

under Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act in fulfilment of the statutory

requirement as per 2R3.

Therefore, having considered the respective positions of the

contesting parties, this Court issues a Writ of Mandamus on the 4th

Respondent and also on the 1st and 2nd Respondents, since it is of the view

that the Petitioners are entitled to relief as they have prayed for in

paragraphs (b) "Grant an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus

directing the Secretary of Pradeshiya Sabha Ambalangoda to honour their

Legal Obligations". (c) "Order Secretary of Pradeshiya Sabha ,

12

..

Ambalandoga to pay Rs. 8,80,000.00 for the acquired land as per the Notice

03-2010 under Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, and Official

interest, delay Charges". and (d). "Order to pay Legal interest for the

period from 1997 to 2015". The Petitioners are entitled to recover interest

as per Section 35 of the Land Acquisition Act.

The 4th Respondent is ordered to finalise the payment of

compensation to the Petitioners within six calendar months from the date

of this Order.

This Court further orders the 1st and the 2nd Respondents to pay costs

in their official capacity in a sum of Rs. 50,000.00 each to the Petitioners

along with the amount of compensation already determined by the 4th

Respondent under Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act.

Application is allowed.
