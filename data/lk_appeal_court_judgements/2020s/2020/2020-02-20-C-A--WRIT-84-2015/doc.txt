HON. JUSTICE ACHALA WENGAPPULI,

The Petitioner had invoked the jurisdiction of this Court conferred

by Article 140 of the Constitution in seeking Writs of Certiorari and thereby

to quash a permit issued to 3rd Respondent by the 1st Respondent under

Section 19(2) of the Land Development Ordinance CP-09") and Mandamus

in compelling the 1st and 2nd Respondents also to have an inquiry in

relation to the said portion of land to grant a permit in respect of the

portion of land possessed by him.

It is stated by the Petitioner that upon his long possession and

development of a parcel of State land, he was subsequently granted a

permit under Section 19(2) of the Land Development Ordinance CP-02")

and the said land is described therein as Lot No. 2279 depicted in the Final

2

Survey Plan No. 43, Sheet No. 21, prepared by Licensed Surveyor H.P.A.

Jayawickrama dated 25.11.1986. The Petitioner claims that, he, in addition to

the Lot No. 2279 described in "P-02", had also possessed a portion of the

adjoining lot described as Lot No. 2282, situated along the western

boundary of Lot No.2279, while one Vimal Ranjith possessed the balance

portion. The Lot No. 2282 is of 0.194 Hectares in its total extent.

The Petitioner alleges that the 3rd Respondent came into possession

of the balance portion of Lot No. 2282, occupied by said Vimal Ranjith, only

in 2002. Since then there were several disputes that had erupted between

the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent over the possession of Lot No. 2282

and consequently Sevenagala Police instituted proceedings under Section

66 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act in the Primary Court of

Embilipitiya in case No. 39790. On 17.11.2004, after an inquiry, the

Petitioner was placed in possession of the disputed land by an order of

Court.

The Petitioner then made several requests, after an initial written

request, to the 1stand 2nd Respondents, requesting them to hold an inquiry

and to regularise his possession over the said portion of land in Lot No.

2282 by alienation, but failed to evoke any response from them. It is

asserted by the Petitioner that there was no regulatory inquiry held.

On or about 23.05.2013, the 1st Respondent had granted permit

under Section 19(2) of the Land Development Ordinance ("P9") to the 3rd

Respondent only to a part of Lot No. 2282, which consists only of 0.1

Hectare in extent from the total extent of 0.194 Hectares. Subsequent to the

permit issued on the 3rd Respondent, she had instituted action in the

3

District Court of Embilipitiya in case No. 13439/L seeking the eviction of

the Petitioner from the land described in the schedule to her plaint, which

is in fact the parcel of State land identified as Lot No. 2282.

The Petitioner had subsequently tendered a surveyor plan (Plan No.

744 of 31.12.2014 of surveyor Costa) upon a commission issued by the

Court as per the 3rd Respondent's request marked as "P12". In the said

plan, the disputed portion of land, currently possessed by the Petitioner is

shown as lot 3 and is in extent of 0.0279 Hectares 111 perches.

In support of his application for a Writ of Certiorari, the Petitioner

states that the grant of permit "P-09" by the 1st Respondent is "illegal, null

and void and of no force or avail in law" as the 1st and 2nd Respondents

have;

a. failed to inquire into the dispute between the Petitioner and 3rd

Respondent before alienating the land under a permit and failed

to comply with Sections 19, 20, 22 and 23 of Land Development

Ordinance and acted in violation of statutory provisions In

alienating the said land, in addition to being in violation of

Article 12(1) of the Constitution,

b. issued the permit contrary to the objectives of the said Ordinance

and had" collateral and extraneous reasons"

c. failed to appreciate or totally ignored the fact that the Petitioner

made a request that the portion he occupies be alienated to him

after he was placed in possession by a Court,

d. failed to consider that the said parcel of land had already been

allocated to one K.A. Ananda Kithsiri in 1992 but the Petitioner

4

had been in its "long, peaceful and uninterrupted possession

over 26 years" and, had acquired "prescriptive title" over it,

e. acted in breach of his legitimate expectation of the grant of a

permit in his favour.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents and the 3rd Respondent have filed

separate statement of objections to the Petitioner's application.

In their objections, the 1st and 2nd Respondents stated that the

Petitioner has come into unlawful occupation of the land in Lot No. 2282

and since he was already issued with a permit in respect of Lot No. 2279,

he cannot obtain a further permit to Lot No. 2282 as well. Whilst admitting

that they have lawfully issued a permit in favour of the 3rd Respondent

under Section 19(2) of the Land Development Ordinance, the 1st and 2nd

Respondents claim that in doing so they have acted lawfully and fairly at

all times and sought dismissal of the application.

In her objections, the 3rd Respondent stated that a Land Kachcheri

was held on 16.12.1984 for alienation of the lands depicted in Plan No. 43

of 25.1.1986, made by surveyor Jayawickrama along with Sheet No. 21. The

selected individuals by the said Land Kachcheri are listed in the document

marked as "Xl" and in the said document under serial No. 28, the name of

Kuruppusinghe Arachchige Ananda Kithsiri is recorded. The said

Kuruppusinghe Arachchige Ananda Kithsiri was eventually issued with a

permit in relation to Lot No. 2282 on 23.05.3013 ("P9"). The 3rd Respondent

claims the said Kithsiri is her husband and was in occupation of Lot No.

2282 even before the land was surveyed. But the Petitioner was not in

5

occupation of Lot No. 2279 at that point of time. Disputing the claim of

"prescriptive" title, the 3rd Respondent stated that she and her son have cut

down some branches from the trees on their property as these branches

causing obstruction to their house. She further claims that it is this action

resulted in the institution of proceedings for causing breach of peace.

The 3rd Respondent sought to provide an explanation to the

difference in the extent to which the permit "P9" was issued. The said

permit was issued in respect of a parcel of land in extent of Hectares 0.100

while Lot No. 2282 is in extent of Hectares 0.194. Placing heavy reliance

upon this difference in the extent of the land in Lot No. 2282, the 3rd

Respondent asserts that said balance extent of the land was alienated by

the 151 Respondent with her husband's consent.

In seeking dismissal of the Petitioner's application, the 3rd

Respondent stated that the Petitioner had failed to challenge the allocation

of land after the Land Kachcheri held under Section 23A of the Land

Development Ordinance as amended by Act No. 27 of 1981 and mislead

this Court with the document marked "P11".

The Petitioner in his counter affidavit challenged the validity of

document marked "Xl" and reiterated his position as asserted in the

Petition. He denied any knowledge in alienating a parcel of land in an

extent of Hectares 0.094 and has tendered the Final Supplementary List

marked as "X4".

It is stated in the Petition of the Petitioner that the 3rd Respondent

and her husband came to possess Lot No. 2282 in 1993. The Petitioner also

states that a permit was issued to the 3rd Respondent and annexed a copy

6

of it as "P9". This permit is dated 23.05.2013. The ground upon which the

Petitioner seeks a prerogative Writ of Certiorari is that the 1st Respondent

had failed to hold an inquiry to the "dispute" he had with the 3rd

Respondent over a portion of Lot No. 2282, which he claimed to be in his

possession, in addition to Lot No. 2279 under the permit "P2". The permit

"P2" is dated 01.02.2000.

The Petitioner stated that after the Land Kachcheri that was held in

1992, he was allocated the said Lot No. 2279. The 3rd Respondent stated

that only after a Land Kachcheri held on 16.12.1984, as per document

marked "X2" (disputed by the Petitioner) lands, including Lot Nos. 2279

and 2282 as per the Final Plan No. 43 of Surveyor Jayawickrama, were

alienated.

The Petitioner, in his petition did not reveal the date of notification

as required by law after the Land Kachcheri that was held in 1992, which

decided to issue a permit in respect of Lot No. 2279 in his favour. As

already noted, the 3rd Respondent, had tendered a document marked "X2"

in support of her claim that her husband was allocated Lot No. 2282 by a

Land Kachcheri held on 16.12.1984, which had alienated State lands

including Lot Nos. 2279 and 2282 as per the Final Plan No. 43 of Surveyor

Jayawickrama. The date of the Final Plan lends support for the 3rd

Respondent's claim.

It is clear from the proceedings before the Primary Court that the

dispute between the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent erupted in March

2004 over a common boundary and a complaint was made to Police. The

Petitioner claimed that he was placed in possession over the disputed

7

portion of land and had already acquired prescriptive title over the said

parcel of land. The failure to hold an inquiry by the 1st Respondent, as

alleged by the Petitioner, is in relation to this dispute.

The Petitioner had been placed in possession of a certain portion of

land only after the dispute resulted in a breach of peace, and upon an order

made by the Primary Court of Embilipitiya, in Case No. 39790. The 3rd

Respondent had subsequently instituted action under case No. 13439

before the District Court of Embilipitiya on 15.08.2014, seeking eviction of

the Petitioner from the land described in her permit ("P9"). The Petitioner

filed his answer on 23.10.2018, and took up the position that he had already

challenged the validity of "P9" before the Court of Appeal, making

reference to the instant application. The Petitioner had filed his Petition in

the Registry of this Court on 24.02.2015, although it is dated 11.12.2014.

But the Land Kachcheri upon which the Final Plan No. 45 was drawn

appeared to have been held on 16.12.1984 as the 3rd Respondent claims.

This could be inferred from the date of the said plan, being 25.11.1986. The

reference to the said plan in describing the boundaries to Lot No. 2279, the

land alienated to the Petitioner in permit "P2" also supports that position.

The Petitioners assertion of holding a Land Kachcheri in 1992 is not

supported by the documents available. The 1st and 2nd Respondents have

not provided any details of the Land Kachcheris.

There is a specific methodology for alienating State land that had

been put in place by the relevant provisions contained in the Land

Development Ordinance. These provisions also include the manner in

which the selections are done regarding the prospective recipients of the

8

State lands that are to be alienated. That method is through Land

Kachcheris. Sections 20 to 23B of the Land Development Ordinance contain

explicit provisions setting out the procedural aspects involved in the

process. Section 23A and 23B specify the course of action that should be

taken by a person aggrieved by a decision taken after an inquiry held at the

Land Kachcheri. As the 3rd Respondent submits, Section 23A and 23B

provides that opportunity, subject to a time period of one year

commencing from the date of notification of such a decision, could be

varied by the Land Commissioner acting in revision.

The Petitioner did not state in his Petition, when the said notice was

published. However, he had received a permit to Lot No. 2279 on

01.02.2000, more than 13 years before the 3rd Respondent did.

There is no explanation by the Petitioner as to why he did not

challenge the decision of Land Kachcheri under Section 23A, when the

predecessor of the 1st Respondent selected the 3rd Respondent's husband as

a recipient under the provisions of Section 23A of the Land Development

Ordinance. The Petitioner is similarly silent as to when he became aware

that a permit had been issued to the 3rd Respondent in respect of Lot No.

2282.

It is noted that the instant application was filed by the Petitioner

after 21 months from the issuance of the permit to the 3rd Respondent.

However, he offers no explanation for this delay in seeking relief under

public law. There is no statement that at least the point at which he came

to know of the issuance of permit to the 3rd Respondent. In the absence of

any explanation provided by the Petitioner as to the delay in challenging

9

the issuance of permit, this Court would consider the material placed

before it to examine the conduct of the Petitioner.

Interestingly, an answer to this delay could be inferred from the

examination of the chronology of events regarding the dispute between the

Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent.

The Sevanagala Police reported facts to the Primary Court about a

breach of peace on 11.03.2004 naming the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent

as parties. After an inquiry, the Court made its order on 29.10.2004, and

thereby placing the Petitioner in possession of a strip of land towards the

3rd Respondent's house, which was the subject matter before that Court.

The 3rd Respondent had thereafter filed an action in the District

Court of Embilipityain case No. 13439/Land, seeking to eject the Petitioner

on 15.08.2014. Only then the Petitioner had filed the instant application, in

challenging the validity of the issuance of "P9" and that too on 24.02.15.

Thereafter the Petitioner filed his answer in the matter pending before the

District Court of Embilipitiya, and took up the position that he had already

challenged the validity of the issuance of the permit, on which the 3rd

Respondent had claimed title, in order to seek eviction of the Petitioner.

Whether there was a Land Kachcheri in 1992 or not as alleged by the

Petitioner, the Final Plan, which demarcated the State lands that are to be

alienated, was prepared on 25.11.1986. It is thus presumed that the

preparation of a Final Plan was made subsequent to the determination of

the prospective recipients of permits under the Land Development

Ordinance considering their un-regularised long possession of the

respective parcels of State land and developmental activities such

10

occupiers have carried out on such lands. Upon examination of the scheme

of Final Plan "X3", it could be seen that except for 7 Lots, aJI other lots are

less than one Hectares in extent. Clearly the Government had limited the

entitlement of land area to be alienated under that particular scheme to any

individual in order to ensure a more equitable distribution of available

State land among the prospective recipients.

In that scheme of land distribution, the Petitioner received Lot No.

2279, while the 3rd Respondent received Lot No. 2282. This scheme was

setup in 1986. The" dispute" leading to the proceedings before the Primary

Court between the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent had erupted only in

2004, after the predecessors of the l Si Respondent and 2nd Respondent have

decided the respective recipients in the said scheme.

The Supreme Court, in its judgement of Gunatilleke v Attorney

General and ArlOther (1979) 1 Sri L.R. 37, on an aJIeged violation of

fundamental right of equality, observed that Government Agent of Nuwara

Eliya having held a Land Kachcheri, placed the Petitioner in a wrong

category after inquiry. Samarakoon CJ stated;

"What the petitioners complain of is of a wrong

determination of facts, namely, that they owned land when

they in fact did not own, possess or occupy land. As a result,

they were placed in the wrong category. This is not a

decision of law but a decision on disputed facts . The bona

fides of the 2nd respondent in making the finding of fact is

not in question. In the circumstances though the petitioners

may have a grievance, I fail to see how a wrong decision bona

11

fide made on a question of fact could constitute a breach of

the fundamental right of equality in the eye of the law. It is

not even a breach of law and 1 cannot see how this Court can

on application made under Article 126 of the Constitution

give these petitioners protection against wrong decisions on

facts due to an error of judgment.

When applying the reasoning of the apex Court to the instant

application; even if the Petitioner's claim that, despite his informing the 1st

Respondent of his "possession" over a portion of land in Lot No. 2282, the

3rd Respondent was issued with a permit without an inquiry, is an accurate

statement of fact if at all, it clearly is a "wrong decision bona fide made on a

question of a fact" and therefore is not tainted with any "breach of law" or

of any illegality. There is no dispute that issuance of a permit over a State

land for its alienation is well within the powers of the 1st Respondent.

Hence there is no dispute over the vires of the 1st Respondent. It appears

that the Petitioner sought a Writ of Certiorari on the basis of procedural

impropriety in the failure to hold an inquiry. In view of the above

considerations, this Court is unable to hold that there was procedural

impropriety in the issuance of a permit to the 3rd Respondent since her

husband's entitlement to a permit was already recognised by the

predecessor of the 1 st Respondent after holding a Land Kachcheri in 1984.

On the other hand, the Petitioner stated in his petition that he had

cultivated and possessed "a larger extent of land despite the extent which

he was allocated to" since "1989". Thus, it is clear that he had encroached

upon the portion of land in Lot No. 2282, only after the Final Plan was

drawn in 1986. The craving for larger land, as entertained by the Petitioner,

12

could be understood given the limited extent of land he had received

under the scheme. But, once the scheme was finalised with blocking out

State land with clear demarcations according to a Final Plan and the

individuals who are to be issued with permits to possess them and

develop, then possession of larger extent of land by an individual recipient,

well beyond his due allocation could become an act of transgression of the

individual rights of any other recipient, if that parcel of land had already

been allocated to such other recipient.

The 3rd Respondent claimed that her husband was selected to receive

a permit to Lot No. 2282, in a Land Kachcheri held in 1984. If the Petitioner

had in fact acquired a "prescriptive title" over the land as he claimed over

the said parcel of land, then he could vindicate his alleged acquired right

before a competent Court.

The 3rd Respondent had already filed action against the Petitioner

seeking his eviction and therefore the Petitioner is afforded an opportunity

to vindicate his alleged acquisition of a "prescriptive title" over the

disputed portion of Lot No. 2282 before that Court. Clearly the Petitioner

therefore has an equally effective alternative remedy to the one he had

chosen to pursue.

In Jayaweera v Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services,

Ratnapura and Another (1996) 2 Sri L.R. 171, it was held that;

" ... the Petitioner who is seeking a relief is an application for

the issue of a Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a

matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine.

Even if he is entitled to relief still the Court had a discretion

13

to deny him of relief having regard to his conduct; delay,

laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction are all valid

impediments which stand against the grant of relief"

Having regard to the facts and circumstances as revealed in the

instant application, it is the considered view of this Court that the

Petitioner is not entitled to any relief that he had prayed for. His

application therefore is refused.

The Petition of the Petitioner is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.

50,000.00.
