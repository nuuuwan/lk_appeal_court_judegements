Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The business of the company by the name of Hijra Farms (Private)

Limited was sold as a going concern to the company by the name of

Three Acre Farms Limited whilst the 5th-102nd Respondent employees

were in the employment of the former company. This happened on or

around 30.12.2003. The employees worked as usual until on

01.04.2004 they saw a notice affixed to the gate of the workplace to the

effect of Work Place closed. The employees complained to the

Commissioner General of Labour that their services of employment had

been terminated abruptly without their knowledge. In the said

3

application, Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd was named as the workplace, and

Ceylon Grain Elevators Pvt Ltdwhich appears to be the parent

company of Three Acre Farms Limitedas the present owner. On a

technical ground in relation to the date of termination stated in the

application, the said application of the employees was dismissed by the

Commissioner General. The employees made a second application

alleging the same, but this time only against Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd. After

an inquiry, the Commissioner General held that both Hijra Farms Pvt

Ltd and Three Acre Farms Ltd were responsible for the termination of

services of the employees. Both Companies by separate writ

applications successfully challenged the said decision of the

Commissioner General. The Court of Appeal quashed the

Commissioner Generals decision inter alia on the premise that the

order particularly against Three Acre Farms Ltd had been made in

violation of the principles of natural justice. The order of the Court of

Appeal was without prejudice to the right of the Commissioner General

to hold a proper inquiry after calling the necessary parties as party

Respondents.1

The second inquiry commenced before the 3rd Respondent Assistant

Commissioner of Labour, with the participation of Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd

and Three Acre Farms Ltd.

There was no issue at the inquiry that (a) the services of the employees

had been terminated (b) without the consent of either the employees or

the Commissioner General of Labour. These were admitted facts. It is

undisputed that termination of employment in such circumstances is in

contravention of section 2(1) of the Termination of Employment of

1 Vide page 437 of X.

4

Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No.45 of 1971, as amended, which

reads as follows:

No employer shall terminate the scheduled employment of any

workman without

a) the prior consent in writing of the workman; or

b) the prior written approval of the Commissioner.

This was recorded by the inquiring officer without any objection from

either company.

The only outstanding issue to be resolved by the inquiring officer was

the employer of the applicant employees at the time of the termination

of services: was it Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd or Three Acre Farms Ltd? The

inquiring officer had correctly identified the issue and demarcated the

parameters or scope of the inquiry and placed it on record. It reads as

follows:

The inquiring officer reiterated the above before adjournment of the

inquiry on that day, and recorded it as follows:

However, before adjournment an unusual application had been made

on behalf of the employees to discharge Three Acre Farms Ltd from the

inquiry and allow the main application to proceed only against Hijra

Farms Pvt Ltd. It appears that the said application had been made to

limit the inquiry, which might otherwise have taken considerable time.

This application of the employees was allowed by the inquiring officer on

the following day in the presence of the employees Attorney-at-Law.5

Three Acre Farms Ltd did not participate at the inquiry thereafter.

In my view, the inquiring officer should not have allowed this

application because the question to be decided at the inquiry was

whether the employer at the time of the termination of employment was

Hijra Farms (Pvt) Ltd or Three Acre Farms Ltd, and the direction of the

Court of Appeal was that the necessary parties should be called in order

to arrive at a fresh decision. This purpose was defeated when Three

Acre Farms Ltd was discharged.

The firm position taken up by Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd at the inquiry was

that they sold the entire property including the business as a going

concern to Three Acre Farms Ltd on 30.12.2003 by deed marked at the

inquiry R3, which was long before the termination of employment, and

therefore, they (Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd) were not responsible for the said

termination.6

At the inquiry, evidence was led by both partiesHijra Farms Pvt Ltd

and the applicant employees. However, before the inquiring officer could

make recommendations to the Commissioner General of Labour to take

a final decision, the said inquiring officer was transferred to a different

Ministry.

The 2nd Respondent Deputy Commissioner of Labour was then

confronted with this issue. The Deputy Commissioner suggested three

options: (a) to make recommendations by the inquiring officer who

conducted the inquiry; (b) to make recommendations by another

5 Vide page 465 of X. 6 Vide the written submission filed by the Petitioner at the inquiry before the Commissioner General of Labour at pages 713-716 of X.

7

inquiring officer after examining the inquiry notes; or (c) to hold a fresh

inquiry. Both parties expressed their views on the matter and the

Deputy Commissioner recorded that the decision on that limited

question would be notified to the parties by written communication.7

Such written communication was not sent and instead the Petitioner

received the final decision of the Commissioner General of Labour

marked P23. It is this decision which the Petitioner seeks to quash by a

writ of certiorari in this application. By this decision, the Commissioner

General has ordered the Petitioner (Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd) to pay over

Rs.9 million to the applicant employees as compensation. This the

Commissioner General has done under section 6A read with section 6D

of the Termination of Employment of Workmen Act.

Section 6A of the Act reads as follows:

Where the scheduled employment of any workman is terminated in

contravention of the provisions of this Act in consequence of the

closure by his employer of any trade, industry or business, the

Commissioner may order such employer to pay to such workman

on or before a specified date any sum of money as compensation

as an alternative to the reinstatement of such workman and any

gratuity or any other benefit payable to such workman by such

employer.

Section 6D deals with the aspect of computation of compensation.

In the decision P23, under the sub-heading reasons for the decision,

the only reason given by the Commissioner General is that the employer

terminated the services of the applicant employees without written

7 Vide pages 640-642 of X.

sanction of either the employees or the Commissioner General of

Labour.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner strenuously contends

that this decision of the Commissioner General is

unreasonable/irrational/procedurally improper/arbitrary/error of law

on the face of the record. I am inclined to agree.

The Commissioner General who took the decision did not hold the

inquiry. He was supposed to act on the recommendations of the

inquiring officer. There are no recommendations made by the inquiring

officer or any other officer. No such recommendations have been

tendered to this Court. It may be recalled that there was an issue

regarding who should make recommendations to the Commissioner

General, as the inquiring officer had been transferred to a different

Ministry. Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner drew the

attention of the Court to the date of the application stated in the

impugned decision to suggest that the impugned decision is not a

considered decision, as the date of the application mentioned therein is

also wrong.

The Commissioner General has acted under section 6A, which speaks of

closure of business by the employer. At the inquiry, there was no issue

whether or not the business was closed. The Petitioner does not

dispute the position of the employees that the business was closed on

01.04.2004. The only issue was who closed the business thereby

terminating the services of the employees. However, the Commissioner

General has not answered this issue, to resolve which alone the inquiry

was conducted. The Commissioner Generals reason for the decision

that the termination of employment was done without the consent of

the employees or the Commissioner General was not a disputed fact. It

9

was so decided by the inquiring officer even before the commencement

of the inquiry, without any objection by either company.

I have no doubt that there is an error on the face of the record insofar

as the impugned decision is concerned. The Commissioner General has

not answered the issue which he was obliged in law to do, thereby

making an irrational order.

Error of law on the face of the record is a ground for certiorari.

If the tribunal had no jurisdiction to inquire into the matter, there is no

issue that the decision taken is a nullity. On the other hand, even if the

tribunal had jurisdiction to inquire into the matter, the decision can

still become a nullity if inter alia (a) it has identified a wrong issue as

the correct issue to be answered or (b) having initially identified the

correct issue, ultimately, albeit bona fide, answered a wrong issue as

the correct issue.

In the leading case of Anisminic Ltd v. Foreign Compensation

Commission [1969] 2 AC 147 at 171 Lord Reid stated:

But there are many cases where, although the tribunal had

jurisdiction to enter on the inquiry, it has done or failed to do

something in the course of the inquiry which is of such a nature

that its decision is a nullity. It may have given its decision in bad

faith. It may have failed in the course of the inquiry to comply with

the requirements of natural justice. It may in perfect good faith

have misconstrued the provisions giving it power to act so that it

failed to deal with the question remitted to it. It may have refused

to take into account something which it was required to take into

account. Or it may have based its decision on some matter which,

10

under the provisions setting it up it had no right to take into

account. I do not intend this list to be exhaustive.

In Gunasekera v. De Mel, Commissioner of Labour (1978) 79(2) NLR 409,

where the order of the Commissioner of Labour was sought to be

quashed by way of certiorari, the Supreme Court held at 426:

Lack of jurisdiction may arise in different ways. While engaged on

a proper inquiry the tribunal may depart from the rules of natural

justice or it may ask itself the wrong questions or may take into

account matters which it was not directed to take into account.

Thereby it would step outside its jurisdiction. A tribunal which has

made findings of fact wholly unsupported by evidence or which it

has drawn inferences wholly unsupported by any of the facts

found by it will be held to have erred in point of law. The concept of

error of law includes the giving of reasons that are bad in law or

inconsistent, unintelligible or it would seem substantially

inadequate. It includes also the application of a wrong legal test to

the facts found taking irrelevant considerations into account and

arriving at a conclusion without any supporting evidence. If

reasons are given and these disclose that an erroneous legal

approach has been followed the superior Court can set the decision

aside by certiorari for error of law on the face of the record. If the

grounds or reasons stated disclose a clearly erroneous legal

approach the decision will be quashed. An error of law may also be

held to be apparent on the face of the record if the inferences and

decisions reached by the tribunal in any given case are such as no

reasonable body of persons properly instructed in the law

applicable to the case could have made.

11

In The Board of Trustees of the Maradana Mosque v. Mahmud (1966) 70

CLW 41, the Appellants successfully challenged the take-over order by

the Minister on two grounds: one, in violation of a rule of natural

justiceaudi alteram partem; and the other, as held by the Privy

Council, in making the order the Minister had not considered the right

question which was whether the school was presently being

administered in contravention of the Act. The Minister should have

considered himself with the present conduct of the school, and not the

past. Since he had not considered the right question, he had no

jurisdiction to make the order.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents, relying on

Hassan v. Fairline Garments International Ltd [1989] 2 Sri LR 137,

argues that the impugned decision is flawless, as Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd

could not sell the business to Three Acre Farms Ltd with the employees,

and therefore Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd was the employer of the applicant

employees when the termination of employment took place by the

closing of the business on 01.04.2004.

This is not the reason given by the Commissioner General when

ordering that Hijra Farms Pvt Ltd shall pay compensation to the

employees.

The above submission of learned Deputy Solicitor General is relevant if

the Commissioner General had decided who the employer of the

applicant employees was at the time of the termination of employment.

This was not done.

The Deputy Solicitor General during the course of the argument

accepted that there is no express provision in law which prohibits an

employer from transferring a business as a going concern while allowing

12

employees to continue their employment with the same terms and

conditions without a break in service. Such a question, he admitted,

shall be decided on the unique facts and circumstances of each

individual case.

If it is otherwise, i.e. if there is a blanket prohibition in law to sell a

business as a going concern with the labour force, then there was no

necessity in this case for an inquiry by the Commissioner General of

Labour with voluminous evidence led by the parties in order to

ascertain who the employer was. On the admitted facts by Hijra Farms

Pvt Ltd, which I adverted to earlier (i.e. that they sold the company on

30.12.2003), an order could have been made.

In Hassans case (supra) the employer company, without the consent of

the employee, transferred the employee (a) to a different company (a

subsidiary of the former), (b) situated in a different place, (c) in a

different capacity. The employee refused to go and complained to the

Commissioner General of Labour of termination of services and sought

reinstatement with back wages. The question to be decided was not

who the employer was (as in this case) but whether or not there was a

termination of services in such circumstances. The Commissioner

General answered that question in the affirmative and the Supreme

Court affirmed it.

The facts in the instant case are totally different. The issue to be

resolved is different. In the instant case, if I may repeat, the issue is not

that there was a termination of services but rather who occasioned it. It

is true that the word employer is defined in the Termination of

Employment of Workmen Act. Nevertheless, the question who the

employer is is not a pure question of law. It is a mixed question of fact

and law.

13

This Court by exercising writ jurisdiction cannot decide disputed

questions of fact. That is the task of the inquiring officer on whose

recommendations the Commissioner General would ultimately make a

final decision. This has not been resolved.

The impugned decision of the Commissioner General of Labour marked

P23 cannot be allowed to stand. I quash it by certiorari.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed but without costs.
