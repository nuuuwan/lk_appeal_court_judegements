Before: Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Thishya Weragoda with Pratheep Welikumbura and Chinthaka Sugathapala for the Petitioner Suranga Wimalasena, Senior State Counsel for the 1st Respondent R.M.D.Bandara for the 6th Respondent Written Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 4th January 2019 Tendered on behalf of the 1st Respondent on 13th May 2019 Tendered on behalf of the 6th Respondent on 11th December 2018 and 22nd January 2019 Decided on: 8th June 2020 Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The issue that arises in this application is whether the decision of the 1st

Respondent, the National Gem and Jewellery Authority of Sri Lanka (the NGJA),

to release to the 6th Respondent, 75% of the ground share revenue deposited

with the NGJA in terms of a gemming license issued by it to Nihal Senanayake,

is illegal, irrational or arbitrary.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner states that the 2nd Respondent obtained a loan from him on or

around 5th February 2002, and that as security for the said loan, the 2nd

Respondent transferred to the Petitioner, his undivided 1/3 share in a land

3

known as Ma Wee Kumbura by Deed of Transfer No. 12696. A copy of the

said deed has been annexed to the petition marked A1a. The Petitioner

admits that the above transfer was conditional in that the 2nd Respondent was

required to pay the said sum, with interest, within a period of one year. If such

sum was paid as agreed, the Petitioner admits that he was then required to

execute a deed of transfer in favour of the 2nd Respondent. This Court must

observe that the Petitioner and the 2nd Respondent had entered into similar

arrangements in the past as well, in respect of the same land, with the 2nd

Respondent settling the sums of money borrowed from the Petitioner on each

occasion.1 The Petitioner states that in this instance, the 2nd Respondent failed

to repay the said loan with interest, and by virtue of such failure, he is the

present owner of the property referred to in A1a.

The 2nd Respondent denies the claim of the Petitioner that he failed to pay the

sum of money that was borrowed. The 2nd Respondent states that he filed Case

No. 27320/MB in the District Court of Ratnapura in July 2012 (which is over 10

years after the execution of A1a) seeking an order of Court to (a) release the

mortgage on the payment of a sum of Rs. 90,185/ and (b) re-transfer the said

property.2 However, the said action had been withdrawn in December 2014.3

The 2nd Respondent had thereafter filed an application with the Debt

Conciliation Board in 2016, which application is said to be pending.4

According to the NGJA, in June 2011, a person named Nihal Senanayake had

made an application to it for a gemming license in respect of the entire land

1 Vide Deed No. 11969 dated 5th November 2000, and Deed No. 12663 dated 19th January 2002, marked 6R2 and 6R3, respectively. 2 Vide plaint marked A4a. 3 Vide proceedings of 18th December 2014, annexed to A4a. 4 Vide application made to the Debt Conciliation Board marked A4b.

known as Ma Wee Kumbura, including the 1/3 that was the subject matter of

the Deed of Transfer A1a.

Issuing of licences to carry out mining for gems (commonly known as gemming

licenses) is governed by the State Gem Corporation By-Laws No.1 of 1971,

made by the State Gem Corporation under Section 21(1) of the State Gem

Corporation Act No. 13 of 1971.5 In terms of the said By-laws, no license shall

be granted to any person, unless such person himself owns the land, or he has

obtained the consent of so many of the other owners as to ensure that the

applicant and such other consenting owners together own at least two thirds

of the land in respect of which the application has been made.

The said By-laws requires the licensee to pay to the NGJA, out of the sale

proceeds of the gems that are extracted, a sum of money equivalent to the

share of the land owned by those co-owners and other persons who, having an

interest in the land, have withheld their consent at the time of granting the

license, to enable the NGJA to pay such money to the said persons.

While the said Nihal Senanayake owned 1/18th of the said land, he had

produced the written consent of the other owners of the land, including that of

the 2nd Respondent, in order to satisfy the minimum ownership requirement

specified in the said By-Laws. However, the 2nd Respondent had by then

transferred to the Petitioner his rights to the land by A1a, and therefore, the

2nd Respondent could not have consented to the issuing of such license to

5 The said by-laws have been published in the Ceylon Government Gazette No. 14989/8 dated 23rd December 1971. Although the State Gem Corporation Act has been repealed vide Section 54(1) of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority Act No. 50 of 1993 (NGJA Act), in terms of Section 54(2)(h) of the NGJA Act, every by-law made under the State Gem Corporation Act, and in force on the day immediately preceding the date on which the NGJA Act came into operation and which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the NGJA Act, shall be deemed to be rules and by-laws made under the NGJA Act.

Nihal Senanayake. The NGJA, probably being unaware of A1a had issued a

gemming license in respect of the said land, valid until 11th July 2012, to the

said Nihal Senanayke.

In September 2011, the Petitioner had informed the NGJA that he was

objecting to the issuing of the said license to Nihal Senanayake, on the basis

that the Petitioner is the owner of 1/3rd of the said land.6 The NGJA, having

summoned the Petitioner and the 2nd Respondent for an inquiry, had accepted

the fact that 1/3rd of the land had been transferred to the Petitioner, but

having obtained the consent of the Petitioner,7 had continued to issue the

gemming license to Nihal Senanayake. The NGJA had accordingly directed that

1/3rd of the proceeds of the gems derived by the license holder from the

gemming activity carried out on the said land be deposited with the NGJA, until

the issue of entitlement to the said 1/3rd revenue share was resolved.

Having conducted several inquiries over the years, the NGJA had held a fresh

inquiry on 15th September 2016, with the participation of the Petitioner and

the 2nd Respondent, in order to determine the entitlement to the 1/3rd share of

the revenue. The position taken up by the 2nd Respondent at this inquiry was

two-fold.

Firstly, he submitted that while Deed No. 4432 dated 24th October 1984,

annexed to the petition marked A3 conferred on him ownership to 1/3rd of

the land, he claimed that the subterranean rights, which include the right to

carry out gemming, were divided among himself and the 3rd 5th Respondents.

6 Vide letter dated 16th September 2011 marked R3. 7 Vide letter of consent marked R6.

6

In support of his position that A3 draws a distinction between the

superterranean and subterranean rights, the 2nd Respondent relied on the final

paragraph of the schedule to A3, which reads as follows:

W;=rg mqiaie,af,a l=Uqro kef.Kysrg uy we,o ol=Kg ngfodv.y,shoao

niakdysrg rlaflgsgsf.a f.dve,a,o udhsus jq jS fome,a,la muK jmirsh l=Uqfrka

f,igo fjS'

Thus, according to the 2nd Respondent, by A3 he had acquired 1/3rd of the

superterranean rights to the land, and 1/12th of the subterranean rights.

The second aspect of the 2nd Respondents position before the Inquiry Officer

was that he has only transferred to the Petitioner the superterranean rights he

has to the said land, and that he has not transferred the subterranean rights to

the Petitioner. The schedule in A1a reads as follows:

7

Therefore, it was the submission of the 2nd Respondent that the Petitioner is

not entitled to the aforementioned 1/3rd revenue share deposited with the

NGJA, as he, together with the 3rd 5th Respondents own the subterranean

rights.

The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Respondents are thereafter said to have transferred their

subterranean rights to the 6th Respondent by Deed of Transfer No. 7406 dated

18th June 2016, while the 5th Respondent, by an affidavit dated 25th November

2016 had stated that she intends to transfer to the 6th Respondent her 1/4th

share to the subterranean rights. Hence, as at present, the claim for 3/4th of

the said 1/3rd revenue share is between the Petitioner and the 6th Respondent.

After the said inquiry, the NGJA, by its letter dated 11th January 2017, annexed

to the petition marked A7 had informed the 2nd Respondent, with copy to the

Petitioner, as follows:

Aggrieved by the aforesaid decision, the Petitioner filed this application,

seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision contained in A7;8

b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent from recognizing any

claim of the 2nd 6th Respondents in respect of the said 1/3rd share, until

the determination of a Court of competent jurisdiction;9

8 Vide paragraph (b) of the prayer to the petition. 9 Vide paragraph (c) of the prayer to the petition.

9

c) A Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent to recognize the

Petitioner as the owner of the said 1/3rd share, until the determination of

a Court of competent jurisdiction;

d) A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st Respondent to release the 1/3rd of

the revenue share deposited with the 1st Respondent to the Petitioner.

It is in these circumstances that this Court must consider whether the above

decision of the NGJA is illegal, irrational or arbitrary.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has challenged A7 on the following

three grounds:

(a) Subterranean rights cannot be transferred separately;

(b) The NGJA erred when it referred to A1a as a mortgage;

(c) The NGJA has no power to determine ownership disputes.

This Court shall now consider each of the above three grounds.

The first argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that

subterranean rights cannot be transferred separately, and that the transfer of

such rights by A3 to the 3rd 5th Respondents is bad in law. He stated further

that when the 2nd Respondent transferred the 1/3rd undivided share to the

Petitioner by A1a, he transferred the entire land, including the subterranean

rights. A1a cannot be read in isolation, as the 2nd Respondent can only

transfer what he has received by A3. In support of his argument, the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner cited the maxim, cujus est solum ejus usque ad

10

caelum et infernos, which means, the rights of the surface owner extend

upwards to the heavens and downward toward the center of the earth.

The learned Counsel for the 6th Respondent has drawn the attention of this

Court to the judgment in Jayasundera vs Wijetilake and Others.10 In that case,

the respondent had instituted action seeking a declaration of title to the

corpus and an injunction restraining the appellant from gemming in the land.

The position of the appellant was that his predecessor in title, Punchi

Mahattaya had executed a deed of transfer in favour of the plaintiff, but with

the following reservation: ueksla .rd .eksSfus n,h ug b;srs lrf.k. The

learned District Judge, whilst recognizing the division of ownership rights, had

come to a finding that the rights reserved by Punchi Mahaththaya does not

devolve on his heirs and are extinguished on his death.

This Court, having considered whether a reservation such as the above clause

can be inserted by a transferor, held as follows:

It is to be seen that minerals form part of the land and in a normal

transfer of a land it conveys title to the minerals as well. Thus if the title to

the minerals were to be reserved in the transfer it must be stated so in the

instrument of transfer.

In the deed in question marked P4 the vendor has specifically excepted the

minerals in the operative part of the deed. Thus it is very clear that he has

not sold the mineral rights. In the habendum it is stated:

10 (2006) 3 Sri LR 401.

11

by; lS bvus fldgsGdih iy m<;=re .ek uska u;=j;a uf.a Wreulaldr ..... lsisu

wdrjq,la lrkak ner yegshgo, .. ysoe,af,l mqxps uy;auhd .ka wdrpsps tlafld

Tyqf.a Wreulaldr .. by; lS bvus fldgsGdih iy m<;=re ksrjq,aj nqla;s

jsoskav.

Habendum is the part of a deed that defines the extent of the interest or

rights being granted and any condition affecting the grant. So that Punchi

Mahaththaya's intention to convey only the land, fruits and trees without

minerals is evident without any ambiguity for he has excepted rights or

interest to minerals in the operative part. When the operative part of the

deed and the Habendum is read together it is very clear that the vendor on

deed marked P4 the aforesaid Punchi Mahaththaya had no intention to

sell the minerals to the vendee.

This Court had thereafter cited the following passages from Wille's Principles

of South African Law which confirms that mineral rights can be alienated

separately:

"Subject to the provisions of mining legislation, a right to prospect for and

take minerals from the land of another may be constituted for a fixed

period of time or in perpetuity and registered against the title-deeds of the

land. Such a right to minerals is alienable and passes on the death of the

holder to his successors. It should therefore be classified as a real right sui

generis rather than as a quasi-servitude".11

11 Ibid; page 257.

12

"A right to minerals becomes separated from the ownership of land when

the landowner transfers the land to another person but reserves the

mineral rights.

Although it has been held that mineral rights may be reserved and

registered for the lifetime only of a person it is trite law that mineral rights

are freely transferable and transmissible.12

Thus, the first argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is contrary to

the principle set out in Jayasundera vs Wijetilake and Others, even though the

said judgment is only an authority for the proposition that a seller can reserve

mineral rights for himself. As noted earlier, in the present application, the

seller in Deed No. 4432 marked A3 did not reserve for herself the mineral

rights. Instead, what the seller has done is to bifurcate the ownership rights,

and give the 2nd Respondent the ownership to the superterranean rights in the

land, and give the 2nd 5th Respondents the rights to the minerals, in equal

share. While it is not the function of this Court to determine the legality of

such an arrangement, it is the view of this Court that the first argument of the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner that subterranean rights cannot be

transferred separately is without merit.

The second argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

NGJA erred when it referred to A1a as a Deed of Mortgage when it was in fact

a transfer. While the reference in A7 that A1a is a Deed of Mortgage is only

an observation, the said observation is not entirely correct especially since it is

admitted that A1a was a conditional transfer at the time of its execution.

12 Ibid; page 277.

13

However, the said error is insignificant and does not affect the validity of the

decision in A7. Hence, this Court does not see any merit in the second

argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

The final argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that in

deciding whether to grant a license or when deciding on the entitlement to the

ground share, the NGJA does not have the power to make determinations on

the ownership or the title of the parties. This Court has already referred to the

By-laws that govern the issuance of gemming licenses, which require the NGJA

to be satisfied that the applicant, either by himself or together with others,

own at least 2/3 of the land. The issuing of the gemming license to such an

applicant would therefore be dependent on the NGJA being satisfied of the

ownership of the applicant and other consenting co-owners, to the land in

which the mining is to take place. Similarly, the entitlement to 1/3rd of the

ground share revenue too would be dependent on the NGJA being satisfied of

the ownership of the persons who have not consented to the issuing of the

license.

It was the position of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner (a) that the NGJA

can only determine on a prima facie basis if an applicant has satisfied the

required ownership for the issuance of a gemming license, (b) that the NGJA

has no judicial power to determine the question whether the subterranean

rights claimed by the 6th Respondent are valid in law, and (c) that such a

question can only be determined by a Court of competent jurisdiction.

The extent to which the NGJA can determinine disputed questions relating to

the ownership of an applicant for a license was considered In Weerasinghe v.

14

Podimahatmaya.13 In that case, the petitioner had made an application for a

gemming license in respect of a land to which he had acquired leasehold rights.

The 1st and 2nd respondents opposed the said application on the basis that they

have acquired prescriptive title to the said land. The question whether the

decision of the NGJA that a gemming license to a land could not be granted

until there is a determination of the ownership by a Court of competent

jurisdiction, was answered by this Court in the following manner:

It is undoubtedly correct that the burden of proving ouster among co-

owners rests on the party claiming such ouster in a duly constituted

action. But the question before the 3rd Respondent at the inquiry was to

decide on the issue of a gemming license in accordance with the

regulations. Regulation 8 made under the Act provides that the

Corporation may, if it is satisfied that the applicant for a license has

obtained the consent of the owners of more than 2/3 share of co-owned

land issue such a license. It appears that this is a discretionary power

vested in the Corporation. The question before this court, therefore, is

whether this power has been exercised within justifiable limits.

Learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the petitioner contended

that if the corporation was permitted to refuse licenses on such grounds,

the door would be open for any person who wished to obstruct the grant

of a license to merely put forward an alleged prescriptive right to an

appropriate share of the land to attain the object he sought. He further

argued that the 3rd Respondent should have, on the admission of the

respondents of the paper title in the petitioner, allowed the grant of the

13 [1994] 3 Sri LR 230.

15

permit to both lots and left the respondents to vindicate their alleged

titled if they so desired. The discretion vested in the Corporation to reject

an entirely frivolous claim and an objection based thereon may no doubt

be deemed to exist, as otherwise the grant of licenses may be seriously

impeded. But on the facts of the instant case, as the respondents were

themselves co-owners who claimed ouster of the other co-owners who

had granted their consent and also be in possession of lot 2, it cannot be

said that the 3rd respondent has exercised its discretion wrongly. The

adjudication of disputed title is not within its purview and a title could be

acquired by prescription as by any other means.

The above judgment has been followed by this Court in Ranabahuge

Chithrasiri and another v. National Gem and Jewellery Authority.14

This Court is of the view that the principle laid down in Weerasinghe would

apply to situations such as what has arisen in this application, namely where

the NGJA has to determine entitlement to the revenue share deposited with it,

as in both situations, the issue is dependent on a determination of the

ownership of the land. This Court is also of the view that the NGJA can examine

the documents presented to it in order to satisfy itself, on a prima facie basis, if

the applicant for the revenue share can claim ownership to the land in issue

and thereby an entitlement to such revenue share. However, where there are

competing claims, it is neither the function nor the task of the NGJA to

determine either the ownership of the parties, or ownership disputes among

the parties.

14 CA (Writ) 38/2016; CA Minutes of 31st May 2018.

16

This Court shall now consider whether the NGJA exceeded its jurisdiction and

made either of the above determinations. In doing so, this Court shall bear in

mind the statement of Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v.

Minister for the Civil Service15, where, having classified the three grounds

upon which administrative action is subject to judicial review, namely

'illegality', 'irrationality' and 'procedural impropriety', he proceeded to state

that by 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision

maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making

power and must give effect to it.

This Court has examined the report of the Inquiry Officer marked R22, which

forms the basis for the decision conveyed to the parties by A7. The Inquiry

Officer, having exhaustively dealt with the relevant facts, has identified the

issue before her, in the following manner:

uQ,slj jsiosh hq;= mqYakh (Crux of the matter)

wxl 12696 iy 2002.02.05 oske;s Tmamqfjka vns.mS.chr;ak hk whg W.ia lr

we;af;A fmd<j Wv fldgi muKlao hk j.

It is not in dispute that Deed No. 12696, marked A1a, has been executed by

the 2nd Respondent, and that it continues to be valid. Thus, until such time that

a decision is taken by the Debt Conciliation Board, the Petitioner has an

entitlement to at least the superterranean rights of the land. The Petitioner,

relying on the following words in A3, jS ;=kame, m,a,yla muK jmirsh we;s

l=Uqfrka iy Bg whs;s ish,q fohskq;a fkdfnoq (1/3) ;=fkka tl mx.=jo and jS

15 [1985] 1 AC 374.

17

l=Uqre mx.= iy tajdg whs;s ish,q foa;a fjS has taken up the position that A3

does not draw a distinction between superterranean and subterranean rights.

On the face of it, this position is correct, but is an issue that was disputed by

the 2nd and/or 6th Respondent. It is the view of this Court that the Inquiry

Officer could not have proceeded any further the moment the Petitioner took

up the position that he owned the subterranean rights as well, as that would

require the NGJA to make a determination on ownership.

The position of the Petitioner cannot be said to be frivolous, for two other

reasons. The first is that A3 has only one vendee i.e. the 2nd Respondent.

Although subterranean rights are said to have been conferred on the 3rd 5th

Respondents, these Respondents are not vendees, nor has any consideration

passed between the vendor and the 3rd 5th Respondents. The second is that

the position that the vendor in A3 had transferred to the 2nd Respondent only

the superterranean rights had been taken up for the first time in the inquiry

that commenced in 2016, even though several inquiries had been held since

2011. This Court has examined the letters written on behalf of the 2nd

Respondent by his Attorney-at-Law in 2013 and 2015,16 as well as the letters

written by the 2nd Respondent in 2011,17 and observes that the position that

the subterranean rights had not been transferred had not been raised in the

said letters. Thus, the issue identified by the Inquiry Officer was not capable of

being given an answer by the NGJA. By doing so, as is evident from paragraph 1

of A7, it is the view of this Court that the NGJA has exceeded its jurisdiction,

and A7 is therefore illegal, and liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

16 Vide letters marked R9 and R12. 17 Vide letters marked R7 and R8.

In the above circumstances, this Court issues the Writ of Certiorari prayed for

in paragraph (b) of the prayer, and the Writ of Prohibition prayed for in

paragraph (c) of the prayer. This Court is of the view that the prayer for the

aforementioned Writs of Mandamus are misconceived in law, as it requires a

determination to be made by this Court on the ownership rights of the

Petitioner, which is not the function of this Court. This Court directs the NGJA

to deposit the aforementioned revenue share in a special account, and to

disburse it, once a Court of competent jurisdiction determines the entitlement

of the parties to the subterranean rights. This Court makes no order with

regard to costs.
