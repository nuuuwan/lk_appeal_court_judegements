Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was mentioned on 15th July 2020, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

Respondents moved that this Court pronounce its Order on whether notice of

this application should be formally issued on the Respondents, on the written

submissions that have already been filed on their behalf.

The question that arises for determination in this application is whether the

route permits issued to the Petitioners by the 1st Respondent, the National

Transport Commission to ply super luxury buses on the Southern Expressway

and/or the Outer Circular Expressway are lifetime permits.1

The facts which are relevant to this application are briefly as follows.

The Petitioners admit that plying of buses on normal roads or otherwise

referred to as traditional routes had been carried out by obtaining route

permits from the 1st Respondent. They claim that such permits were

considered as life time permits and that they were only required to be

renewed annually after paying the relevant fees to the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioners state that while the construction of the first expressway from

Kottawa to Galle was underway, the Government had taken a decision in 2005

that permits to ply buses on the expressway would be issued to those who are

selected by following tender procedure. The Petitioners state that accordingly,

in 2011 five route permits had been issued on the basis of tender to operate

super luxury buses from Kottawa to Galle. The 1st Petitioner states that it is a

recipient of one such permit, but has not produced a copy of such permit.

The Petitioners state that in 2012, a further eight permits had been issued to

operate super luxury buses on the expressway, but without calling tenders, to

persons who had already been issued permits to operate buses on the

traditional route (i.e. from Galle to Colombo on Galle Road), by converting the

permits such persons already held. With the extension of the expressway to

Matara, the 1st Respondent had issued 13 permits on a temporary basis in

2014 to cater to the high demand during the Sinhala Tamil New Year.

Pursuant to a decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers in April 2014, a

Committee had been appointed to study the issuance of permits to operate

super luxury buses on the expressway. The recommendations of the said

Committee had thereafter been placed before the Cabinet of Ministers, who

had approved the implementation of the recommendations of the

Committee, including the following:2

The Petitioners state that 43 permits were issued after the above decision,

and that the said permits are silent with regard to its duration. Although the

Petitioners state that they considered the said permits to be life time permits,

no proof has been adduced to substantiate the said claim. The Petitioners

have however referred to an affidavit filed by the 2nd Respondent, the

Chairman of the National Transport Commission in SC (FR) Application No.

306/2016, where the 2nd Respondent, referring to the said 43 permits, had

stated that the duration of the permit has not been specified but appears to

have been considered as life time permit. The Petitioners therefore state that

the said 43 permits were for all intents and purposes accepted and regarded

by the 1st Respondent Commission and its officials as being Route Permits

issued on a life time basis to the Petitioners, which position has however been

disputed by the learned Deputy Solicitor General.

X18, X19 and X20 have been issued to the holders of the said permits

informing them that the validity of their permits are due to expire, and that

approval of the National Transport Commission had been granted to extend

the validity period for a period of 3 years, in terms of Section 30 of the Act,

subject to payment of the annual renewal fee.

Aggrieved by the decision to renew the permits issued to them, the

Petitioners invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, seeking the following relief:

3 Permit No. 13694 has been issued to the 1st Petitioner.

6

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent

contained in letters marked X18, X19 and X20;

(b) A Writ of Mandamus compelling the Respondents to treat the

Petitioners as life time Route Permit holders, and hence possessing

permits which does not require renewal.

There is no dispute between the parties that in terms of the Act, a permit is

required to operate a bus service for the carriage of passengers, and that the

1st Respondent is empowered in terms of the Act to issue such permits. This

position is confirmed by Sections 18(1) and 21 of the National Transport

Commission Act, No. 37 of 1991, as amended (the Act), which reads as

follows:

Section 18(1):4

No person shall use an omnibus for carriage of passengers for a fee or

reward or separate fare except under the authority of a passenger

service permit for the time being in force issued by the Commission or by

a person authorized in that behalf.

Section 21:

From and after the appointed date no person shall use an omnibus for

the carriage of passengers at separate fares within the specified area

except under the authority of a passenger service permit granted by the

Commission and for the time being in force.

The power to grant permits is contained in Section 24 of the Act, which reads

as follows:

Upon receipt of an application for a passenger service permit, the

Commission may having regard to the demand for omnibus services by

the public, on the route or routes applied for in the application, either

4 Section 18(1) has been repealed and replaced by the Sri Lanka Transport Board Act No. 27 of 2005.

7

grant or if it is satisfied that the grant of such permit would result in the

over allocation of omnibus capacity on the route applied for, refuse to

grant a passenger service permit.

While in terms of Section 25(1), No passenger service permit shall be granted

by the Commission to any person under section 24 except upon the payment

by such person to the Commission of such fee as may be prescribed, Section

22 goes on to provide that, A passenger service permit granted under section

24 shall entitle the holder thereof to use an ominibus of which he is the

registered owner for the carriage of passengers on such route or routes as are

specified in such permit, in accordance with the conditions attached thereto.

In terms of Section 25(2)(b) of the Act, Every passenger service permit

granted under section 24 shall, unless it is cancelled earlier, be in force for such

period not less than one year and not more than three years, as may be

specified in such permit.

The Act contains detailed provisions with regard to the renewal of a permit

issued in terms of Section 24. The starting point is Section 30 of the Act which

reads as follows:

(1) The Commission may subject to subsection (2) and having regard to

the availability of adequate omnibus services to meet the demand

for omnibus services on the route or routes covered by any

passenger service permit granted under section 24 renew such

permit, on application made to it by the holder of such permit for

such period not less than one year and not more than three years

calculated from the date of expiry of the permit.

(2) The Commission may refuse to renew any passenger service permit

granted under Section 24 if it appears to the Commission that the

holder of such permit:

(a) has not observed the provisions of this Act or any regulations

made thereunder;

8

(b) has been convicted of any offence under this Act or any

regulations made thereunder;

(c) has not paid the prescribed fee for the renewal of the permit.

In terms of Section 32, Where the Commission decides to refuse the grant or

renewal of a passenger service permit, or cancel a passenger service permit, it

shall communicate in writing to the applicant or the holder of the permit, as

the case may be, its decision together with the reasons therefor.

Section 33 of the Act provides a person whose application for renewal has

been denied by the 1st Respondent a right of appeal to the Secretary of the

Ministry under which the 1st Respondent functions.5

Thus, the issuance and renewal of a permit is conditional upon the provisions

of Section 24 and 30 of the Act being satisfied. At the point of issuance of a

permit in terms of Section 24, the validity period of a permit should not be

less than one year, and not more than three years. Similarly, a permit which is

renewed in terms of Section 30 shall carry a validity period of not less than

one year, and not more than three years.

There are two matters that need to be considered in answering the question

that has arisen for the determination of this Court. The first is whether the 1st

Respondent has the power to issue life time route permits. The second is

whether the statement of the 2nd Respondent can give rise to a legitimate

expectation that the permits that have been issued to them are life time

permits.

5 Section 33 (1)(a) and (2) reads as follows: (1) The applicant for, or the holder of a passenger service permit who is aggrieved by a decision of the Commission refusing the grant of a passenger service permit under section 24 or the renewal thereof under section 30 may appeal against the decision to the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister within fourteen days of the date on which such decision is communicated to him. (2) The Secretary may on any appeal under subsection (1): (a) allow the appeal and direct the Commission to grant or renew the passenger service permit with respect to which the appeal is made; (b) disallow the appeal: (c) direct the Commission to amend the permit or to grant the permit in accordance with his decision on such appeal.

9

The two sections which are relevant to a determination of the first matter are

Section 25(2)(b) and Section 30 of the Act. In terms of Section 25(2)(b), every

permit that is issued in terms of Section 24 must have a time period specified

therein. While the minimum period of a permit is one year, the maximum

period that a permit can be issued for is three years. Section 30 of the Act

provides for the renewal of a license issued under Section 24 for a period

which shall also not be less than one year and not more than three years

calculated from the date of expiry of the permit. Thus, there can be no doubt

that the validity of a permit is constrained by time, and that the 1st

Respondent cannot issue a route permit without specifying the time period

for which it is being issued. Hence, this Court is of the view that the 1st

Respondent does not have the power in terms of the Act to issue life time

permits and therefore is of the view that permits issued by the 1st Respondent

cannot be considered as life time permits.

The Petitioners had taken up the position in its petition that Sections 25 and

30 of the Act relating to time periods do not apply to the route permits issued

to them, and for that reason the decision in X18, X19 and X20 that the

time period of the permits issued to them has been extended is ultra vires the

powers of the 1st Respondent.6 However, in their written submissions, the

Petitioners have stated as follows:

The presumption that the route permit is a life time permit simply

means that whatever the nominal duration of the route permit i.e.

annual permit or a three year permit, will be automatically renewed as

long as there is no violation of the law and/or regulations.7

This Court is of the view that there is nothing called automatic renewal. The

fact that the Petitioners themselves concede that renewal is subject to there

not being a violation of the law and/or regulations means that the renewal is

not automatic. Furthermore, in terms of Section 30(1), when considering a

renewal, the 1st Respondent shall have regard to the availability of adequate

omnibus services to meet the demand for omnibus services on the route or

6 Vide paragraph 27 of the petition. 7 Vide paragraphs 31, 45 and 59 of the written submissions.

10

routes covered by any passenger service permit, which too means that

renewal is not automatic. Hence, this Court rejects the submission that

renewal of a permit issued by the 1st Respondent is automatic.

The second matter that needs to be considered is whether the

aforementioned statement by the 2nd Respondent can give rise to a legitimate

expectation that the permits that have been issued to them are life time

permits. There is no doubt that the 2nd Respondent cannot make any

representation which is outside the four corners of the law that regulates his

decision making power, and that such a representation is illegal. An

illegitimate representation cannot give rise to a legitimate expectation.

As stated by this Court in Ranasinghe Bandara vs The Director, District Land

Reform Commission,8 the principle that the Court will not give effect to a

legitimate expectation where to do so would involve the decision maker acting

contrary to law is fundamental.

In the case of Ginigathgala Mohandiramlage Nimalsiri v. Colonel P.P.J.

Fernando and others,9 the Supreme Court held that:

An expectation the fulfillment of which results in the decision maker

making an unlawful decision cannot be treated as a legitimate

expectation. Therefore, the expectation must be within the powers of the

decision-maker for it to be treated as a legitimate expectation case. If a

person did not expect anything, then there is nothing that the doctrine

can protect.

Hence, this Court takes the view that the Petitioners cannot rely on the said

statement of the 2nd Respondent to support their argument that the permits

issued to them are life time permits.

Having taken up the position in their petition that the provisions of Sections

25 and 30 of the Act did not apply to such route permits,10 the Petitioners

have gone onto state that the provisions relevant to the granting of the said 8 CA (Writ) Application No. 233/2017; CA Minutes of 17th June 2019. 9 SCFR 256/2010; SC Minutes of 17th September 2015. 10 Vide paragraph 27 of the petition.

11

route permits was Section 8(k) of the Act.11 However, in their written

submissions the Petitioners have stated that Sections 25 and 30 ought to be

read with Section 8(k) of the Act, and that it would be the conditions in the

relevant agreements that would govern the validity of such route periods.12

The Petitioners have not produced any agreement that it has entered into

with the 1st Respondent relating to the use of the buses on the expressway.

Section 8(k) of the Act is a function of the 1st Respondent and not a specific

power. With a view to giving effect to such functions, the 1st Respondent

has been conferred with statutory power by Sections 24, 25 and 30 of the Act

to issue passenger service permits. In all instances where the 1st Respondent

issues permits, Sections 24, 25 and 30 shall be applicable to such permits. The

provisions of the Act relating to imposition of time periods cannot therefore

be replaced by agreement of the parties. In any event, Section 18 of the Act

makes it clear that the use of an omnibus for carriage of passengers for a fee

or reward or separate fare can only be done under the authority of a

passenger service permit issued by the 1st Respondent, upon an application in

that behalf made in terms of Section 24 of the Act. Hence, this Court does not

see any merit in this submission.

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioners have

failed to establish a prima-facie case and a legal basis for this Court to issue

formal Notice of this Application on the Respondents. This application is

accordingly dismissed, without costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

11 Section 8 deals with the functions of the 1st Respondent and paragraph (k), specifies that the 1st Respondent may enter into agreements with any person for the provision of inter-provincial omnibus services and to issue passenger carriage permits in respect thereof. 12 Vide paragraph 61 of the written submissions.
