RESPONDENTS Before: Arjuna Obeyesekere, J Counsel: Mohammed Adamaly with Aeinsley Silva for the Petitioner D.H. Siriwardena for the 1st Respondent Ms. Farzana Jameel, P.C., Additional Solicitor General for the 3rd 6th Respondents Written Submissions: Tendered on behalf of the Petitioner on 21st December 2018, 24th October 2019 and 25th February 2020 Tendered on behalf of the 1st Respondent on 31st January 2019, 5th December 2019 and 25th February 2020 Tendered on behalf of the 3rd 6th Respondents on 12th July 2019 and 24th February 2020 Decided on: 2nd June 2020

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J When this matter was taken up for argument, all learned Counsel informed Court

that written submissions have already been tendered and moved that this Court

deliver judgment on the said written submissions. This Court thereafter invited

the parties to tender their response to four questions raised by this Court, which

has been duly complied with.

The Petitioner has filed this application on 5th December 2013. Even though an

amended petition had been filed on 4th March 2015, the journal entry of 27th May

2015 bears out the fact that notice of the amended petition has not been issued

and that this Court had decided to proceed to argument on the original petition.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner admits that by a letter dated 23rd April 2003, it appointed the 1st

Respondent to the post of driver with effect from 1st April 2003. It is also admitted

that the 1st Respondent had been assigned to work for the Chairman of the

Petitioner, who at the relevant time was a person whom this Court shall refer to

as Mr.SY. It is the case of the Petitioner that Mr.SY resigned on 30th June 2007,

and that as the 1st Respondent did not report for duty thereafter at its Head

Office, the Petitioner issued the 1st Respondent a letter dated 15th October 2007

informing that he has been treated as having vacated his post with effect from 1st

July 2007.

4

Prior to the aforementioned letter being issued, the 1st Respondent had

complained to the Department of Labour that his services have been unfairly

terminated by the Petitioner. In the absence of an amicable resolution of the said

complaint, the Minister of Labour, acting in terms of Section 4(1) of the Industrial

Disputes Act (the Act) had referred the following dispute for resolution by

arbitration:

Whether any injustice was caused to Mr. P.K.Prajitha due to non granting of

employment from the month of July 2007 to Mr. Prajitha who was recruited

to the post of Personal Driver with effect from 1st April 2003 by Asia Capital

Limited, and if any injustice was caused, to what relief he is entitled.

Arbitration proceedings had commenced before the 2nd Respondent Arbitrator on

12th May 2010. While the Petitioner had led the evidence of its Manager (Human

Resources) Mr. P.N.Jansen, the 1st Respondent had given evidence on his behalf.

There is no dispute with regard to the manner in which the proceedings were

conducted before the 2nd Respondent.

By an award dated 14th November 2012, annexed to the petition marked P2, the

2nd Respondent had held as follows:

Aggrieved by the aforementioned award of the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioner has

filed this application seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the said award. This

Court has considered the written submissions filed on behalf of the Petitioner and

notes that the grounds on which the award has been challenged can be divided

into three. The first argument is with regard to the finding of the Arbitrator that

the 1st Respondent has not vacated his post. Under this argument, the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted that the award is perverse, unreasonable

and arbitrary, and that the Arbitrator has failed to take into consideration the

material that was placed before him. The second argument is with regard to the

relief granted to the 1st Respondent, with the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

arguing (a) that there has been a failure to consider compensation as an

alternative to reinstatement; and (b) that there has been a manifest error in the

calculation of the sum awarded as back wages. The third argument is that the

Commissioner General of Labour did not follow the provisions of the Act when he

sought an interpretation of the award, and therefore the interpretation given by

the Arbitrator is null and void.

6

The above three arguments of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner comes

under irrationality and/or unreasonableness, and procedural impropriety, which

have been described by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister

for the Civil Service1, as follows:

By irrationality I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as

Wednesbury unreasonableness2. It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could

have arrived at it.

I have described the third head as 'procedural impropriety' rather than

failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with

procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision.

This is because susceptibility to judicial review under this head covers also

failure by an administrative tribunal to observe procedural rules that are

expressly laid down in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is

conferred, even where such failure does not involve any denial of natural

justice."

This Court shall now consider the first argument of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner that the finding that the 1st Respondent has not vacated his post is

perverse, unreasonable and arbitrary. It would be important to consider at the

outset, what constitutes a vacation of post. This issue was considered by this

1 1985 AC 374 2 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation 1948(1)KB 223

7

Court in Nelson Silva vs. Sri Lanka State Engineering Corporation3 where it was

held as follows:

The concept of vacation of post involves two aspects; one is the mental

element, that is intention to desert and abandon the employment and the

more familiar element of the concept of vacation of post, which is the failure

to report at the work place of the employee. To constitute the first element, it

must be established that the Applicant in not reporting at the work place,

was actuated by an intention to voluntarily vacate his employment.

This Court also held in Nelson Silva that the physical absence and the mental

element should co-exist for there to be a vacation of post.

The Supreme Court in Coats Thread Lanka (Pvt) Limited vs Samarasundera4 has

held as follows:

It has been held in several instances by this court, which now can be

considered as trite law that for abandonment of the contract to be proved,

proof of physical absence as well as the mental element of intent needs to be

established.

I am of the opinion that "absence" here is a reference to the lack of presence

when such presence is deemed necessary in the ordinary course of

employment. In other words, where the Respondent is required to be present

at the work place at a reasonable hour of the day and he absents himself and

3 (1996) 2 Sri LR 342 at 343. 4 2010 (2) Sri LR 1 at page 9

8

such absence continues it can be safely assumed that the first ingredient had

been met. The mental element or what is referred to as animus non

revertendi is the intention to abandon the contract permanently.

The above cases have been cited with approval by this Court in Mahaweli

Authority of Sri Lanka vs Leslie Arambawela and Others5 and have been followed

in several other cases, both by this Court and by the Supreme Court6.

This Court shall now consider whether the award of the 2nd Respondent is

irrational or unreasonable, in the light of the evidence that was presented to him.

It was the position of the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent was working for Mr.

SY as a driver since 2002, and that after Mr.SY became the Chairman of the

Petitioner, the 1st Respondent was offered employment with the Petitioner in the

post of driver. The letter of appointment specified that the 1st Respondent will

report to the Chairman as his personal driver, and attend to any other work

including office related work that the Management may see fit to assign from

time to time. It was in evidence that the 1st Respondent had been confirmed in his

employment by the Petitioner and that the salary of the 1st Respondent had been

remitted to his bank account each month by the Petitioner. The 1st Respondent

was therefore an employee of the Petitioner, who had been assigned to work for

its Chairman, as his personal driver.

5 CA (Writ) Application No. 293/2012; CA Minutes of 30th April 2014, per Sisira De Abrew, J [P/CA, as he then was] 6 See the judgment of the Supreme Court in D.M.B.Warnakulasooriya vs. Hotel Developers (Lanka) Ltd [SC Appeal No. 101/2014; SC Minutes of 26th July 2018]

9

It is not in dispute that Mr.SY resigned from his post as Chairman at the end of

June 2007. It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that in

terms of his letter of appointment, the 1st Respondent was required to report for

duty at the office of the Petitioner, after Mr.SY ceased to be its Chairman. This

Court must note that during the period Mr. SY was in the country, the 1st

Respondent reported to work at the house of Mr. SY, and not to the office of the

Petitioner. However, the 1st Respondent did admit that during the absence of Mr.

SY, he reported for duty to the office of the Petitioner, thus confirming the

position of the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent was required to report to the

Head Office, in the absence of Mr. SY.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to

the evidence of the 1st Respondent before the Arbitrator where the 1st

Respondent admits that he was required to report for duty at the office of the

Petitioner whenever the Chairman was out of the country and that in this

instance, he did not report for work in July 2007, even though the former

Chairman had not only left the country, but the company itself. There however

appears to be some confusion whether the Chairman had left the country in early

July or the latter part of July.

Be that as it may, if the 1st Respondent did not report for duty in July, and if it was

the position of the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent, by his conduct had

demonstrated an intention to abandon his employment, it was open for the

Petitioner to have served the 1st Respondent with a vacation of post notice soon

10

thereafter. This was admittedly not done, although it was the practice adopted by

the Petitioner.

During cross examination, Mr. P.N. Jansen, had stated as follows:7

Q When your organization vacates the post of an employee, what is the

procedure that you adopt?

A Firstly, we send a letter asking him to report for work. If he (does) not

respond within the time frame given to him to report for work, we send

him a letter terminating his services.

Q Have you sent any such letter to the applicant?

A We sent him a letter saying that he is deemed to have vacated his post.

Q That was the final and only letter which you sent?

A That is after 3 months.

Q During the 3 months nothing was done to communicate with the

employee concerned?

A We have no record.

7 Page 9 of the proceedings of 7th July 2010.

11

It was only by letter dated 15th October 2007 that the Petitioner informed the 1st

Respondent that, You have not reported for work on your own accord since 1st

July 2007. You are therefore deemed to have vacated your post.

Mr. Jansen also admitted that even though the Petitioner never informed the 1st

Respondent that no salary will be paid if he does not report for duty, the

Petitioner had informed the company preparing the pay-sheets of its employees

not to pay the salary due to the 1st Respondent. It is an admitted fact that the

salary of the 1st Respondent for the month of July was not remitted to the bank

account of the 1st Respondent, as was the practice.

This Court has examined the evidence led before the Arbitrator and observes

that, even if this Court accepts the position of the Petitioner that the 1st

Respondent did not report for duty on 1st July 2007, two important events took

place thereafter but prior to 15th October 2007 that negates the mental element

that is required in order to satisfy the test of vacation of post.

The first event is the fact that the 1st Respondent did report for duty at the office

of the Petitioner, at least by end July 2007, and well before the letter dated 15th

October was sent. This is borne out by the letter dated 27th November 2007

written by the 1st Respondent where he states as follows:

The fact that the 1st Respondent reported for duty on 1st July 2007 but was told by

Mr. NS to tender his resignation has in fact been suggested to the witness of the

Petitioner.8

The 1st Respondent has reiterated the above position when he was cross

examined on the next date,11 as well as during re-examination.12

The above position of the 1st Respondent that he reported to the office of the

Petitioner in early July, as well as when he did not receive his salary for the month

of July, and that he was told by Mr. NS and Mr. AS that he would no longer be

11 Page 3 of the proceedings of 9th June 2011. 12 Page 9 of the proceedings of 20th June 2011.

16

employed by the Petitioner, has not been challenged during cross examination of

the 1st Respondent.

It is the view of this Court that the above conduct of the 1st Respondent is not the

conduct of a person who had the intention to abandon his employment. Having

considered the evidence that was placed before the Arbitrator, this Court is not

in a position to arrive at the conclusion that the failure on the part of the 1st

Respondent to report at the work place, was actuated by an intention to

voluntarily vacate his employment.

The second event that negates the mental element that is required in order to

satisfy the test of vacation of post is the fact that the 1st Respondent had

complained to the Department of Labour by his letter dated 9th October 2007

about not being allowed to report for work. The 1st Respondent would not have

complained to the Department of Labour if he did not have any intention of

continuing with his employment at the Petitioner. By a letter dated 15th October

2007, the Department of Labour had informed the Petitioner to be present for an

inquiry on 31st October 2007. Thus, by the time the vacation of post letter was

served, the 1st Respondent had already lodged a complaint with the Department

of Labour. It therefore appears that the letter of 15th October 2007 was sent by

the Petitioner, possibly as a defence to the said complaint of the 1st Respondent.

It is the view of this Court that in the above factual circumstances, the said letter

of vacation of post served by the Petitioner does not serve any purpose, bears no

value, and fails to negate the mental element that is required to establish that the

1st Respondent had vacated his post.

17

In the above circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the evidence led

before the Arbitrator was sufficient to establish that the 1st Respondent did not

have any intention to vacate his post. Furthermore, the evidence establishes that

the absence of the 1st Respondent from his work place was as a result of the

action of the senior employees of the Petitioner. In the above factual

circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the conclusion of the Arbitrator

that the 1st Respondent had not vacated his post is a reasonable conclusion.

Hence, this Court cannot agree with the first submission of the Petitioner that the

Arbitrator erred in fact and in law, when he arrived at the said conclusion.

The second argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner has two aspects.

The first was that the 1st Respondent served in the capacity of a personal driver to

the Chairman of the Petitioner and in view of that fact, the Arbitrator erred when

he failed to consider compensation as an alternative to reinstatement, as

required by Section 33(3) of the Act.

Section 33(3) reads as follows:

Where any award or order of a labour tribunal contains a decision under

paragraph (b) of subsection (1) as to the reinstatement in service of any

workman in any employment, then, if the employment is in the capacity of

personal secretary, personal clerk, personal attendant or chauffeur, to the

employer, or of domestic servant, or in any other prescribed capacity of a

description similar to those hereinbefore mentioned, the award or order of a

18

labour tribunal shall also contain a decision, under paragraph (d) of that

subsection, as to the payment of compensation to the workman as an

alternative to his reinstatement.

It is an admitted fact that the 1st Respondent, having been issued a letter of

employment by the Petitioner, was an employee of the Petitioner. His assignment

was to work as a personal driver to the Chairman of the Petitioner. It is relevant

to note that the letter of appointment refers to the Chairman as opposed to Mr.

SY, the Chairman. Once Mr. SY ceased to function as Chairman, it was the case of

the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent was required to report for duty at the head

office of the Petitioner, which is an admission on the part of the Petitioner that

the 1st Respondent is the driver of the Chairman, whoever the Chairman may be.

In fact, the failure to report for work after Mr. SY ceased to be the Chairman,

formed the basis for the Petitioner treating the 1st Respondent as having vacated

his post. If this be so, the 1st Respondent cannot be categorized as a personal

driver for the purposes of Section 33(3) of the Act, and therefore, the Arbitrator

has not erred by not considering the provisions of Section 33(3).

The second aspect of the second argument of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner was that there has been a manifest error in the calculation of the sum

awarded as back wages. The arbitrator has directed that the 1st Respondent be

paid back wages for the period July 2007- October 2012 at the rate of Rs.

25,604.58 per month. The aggregate sum due should therefore be a sum of Rs.

1,638,693.12. The Arbitrator has however given the aggregate as Rs.

2,538,693.12, which is Rs. 900,000 more than what it should be. The learned

19

Counsel for the Petitioner has submitted that this is an error on the face of the

record which vitiates the validity of the award. While there is certainly an error,

this Court does not agree that it affects the validity of the award. It is the view of

this Court that there shall be sufficient compliance with the award if the

Petitioner pays back-wages for the period July 2007- October 2012 at the rate of

Rs. 25,604.58 per month.

This Court shall now discuss the final argument of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner. The award of the Arbitrator was delivered on 14th November 2012, and

was published in the Gazette on 6th December 2012. By letter dated 28th March

2013, the 1st Respondent had informed the 3rd Respondent that the Petitioner has

not complied with the award, which, as noted earlier, was to reinstate the 1st

Respondent. As the award was silent as to the date on which the reinstatement

should take place, the 3rd Respondent had sought a clarification from the

Arbitrator. It is the view of this Court that the order of reinstatement should have

been complied with, no sooner the award was conveyed to the Petitioner, and

hence the necessity to seek an interpretation, as done by the 3rd Respondent, did

not arise. The only exception to not complying with the award is found in Section

20 of the Act, in terms of which an employer may give notice of repudiation,

which notice however is prospective in nature.

Be that as it may, an interpretation can be sought in terms of Section 34(1) of the

Act, which reads as follows:

20

If any question arises as to the interpretation of any award made under this

Act by an arbitrator or by an industrial court, or of an order made under this

Act by a labour tribunal, other than an order made on an application made

under section 31B of this Act, the Commissioner or any party, trade union,

employer or workman, bound by the award or order, may refer such question

for decision to such arbitrator or the person or persons who constituted such

industrial court or to such labour tribunal, and if such reference is not

possible for any reason whatsoever, may refer the question for decision to an

industrial court; and the arbitrator to whom or the industrial court or the

labour tribunal to which the question has been referred shall decide such

question after hearing the parties, or without such hearing if the consent of

the parties has been first obtained:

Provided that no employer or workman who is a member of any trade union

shall, independently of such union, refer a question for decision under the

preceding provisions of this subsection.

It is the position of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the Arbitrator

proceeded to issue the letter dated 1st October 2013 informing that the effective

date would be 13th August 2012, but that the Arbitrator failed to hear the parties

before doing so.13 This Court is of the view that the provisions in Section 34(1)

with regard to a hearing must be complied with, and in the absence of a hearing,

the interpretation is not valid. Non compliance with the provisions of Section

34(1) however, does not affect the validity of the award P2. Therefore, this Court

13 The said letter contains the details of another award delivered by the same Arbitrator in respect of another employee of the Petitioner.

21

is of the view that the failure on the part of the Arbitrator to act in terms of

Section 34(1) has not prejudiced the Petitioner.

In the above circumstances, and subject to the decision of this Court with regard

to the calculation of back wages, this Court does not see any legal basis to grant

the relief prayed for by the Petitioner. This application is accordingly dismissed,

without costs.
