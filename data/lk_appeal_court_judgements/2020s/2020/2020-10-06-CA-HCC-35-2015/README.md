The accused appellant along with two other accused were indicted

in the High Court of Gampaha on 13 counts, under the Penal Code as

well as under the Offensive Weapon's Act.

At the conclusion of the trial the 151 accused Malnaidelage Pradeep

was acquitted, and the 2 nd and the 3rd accused were convicted of the

offences of murder of Subasinghe Arachchige Percy Subasinghe and

Kailani Kaushalya Hapugoda and causing injuries to ten others with a

hand grenade (ten counts). The 2nd and the 3rd accused appealed against

the conviction and the sentence, however when the appeals were being

taken up the 3rd accused Ellawala Arachchige Sarathchandra Allewela

who was a police officer, had withdrawn the appeal and the appeal of

only the 2nd accused has been considered and by judgment dated

19.06.2009, on the preliminary issue that the jury option was not

informed to the accused, the judgment was set aside and the accused

appellant was acquitted.

2

However, the Supreme Court on 12.2.2010 directed that the

matter be re-tried before the Gampaha High Court on the same

indictment.

After the re-trial, the impugned judgment was delivered on

23.01.2015 against the second accused, finding him guilty on Count

one and two for committing the death of Subasinghe Arachchige Percy

Subasinghe and Kailani Kaushalya Hapugoda on or about 10.05.1996

and on count 13 for attempted robbery of money that was in the

possession of Palliyaguruge Somaratne Hapugoda usmg a deadly

weapon and was sentenced to death for count no 1 and 2 respectively,

and seven years rigorous imprisonment for count no 13.

Aggrieved by the said judgment the second accused (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the appellant) has preferred this appeal.

The following grounds of appeal were urged by the counsel for the

appellant

1. The learned trial Judge erred in law by failing to consider the vital

contradictions of the prosecution's case.

2. Findings of the learned trial judge in the impugned judgement are

contrary to the evidence led at the trial.

3. The learned trial judge has failed to consider the dock statement

made by the appellant in the correct perspective.

3

4. In any event the conviction for murder is unsafe in the light of the

evidence adduced at the trial court is concerned.

The mam eye witness for the prosecution PW 1 Somaratna

Hapugoda has testified that on 19.05.1996, around 8.30 at night

when he was counting money inside the wine store that belonged to his

son Gamini Jayantha Hapugoda PW 2, two people wearing helmets and

jerkins had come on a motor cycle and stopped outside the store and

the pillion rider has come near the counter and although the witness

asked what he wanted there had been no answer .The rider had gone

near the iron door and the witness had heard the sound of something

being taken out of a bag and then part of a weapon has been noticed by

him and he has slowly without drawing suspicion, had unlocked the

latch from inside and has moved quickly opening the door and kicking

the person to the ground and fell on top of him shouting out

~C5)~.~e5:X)(oo!:1S. When grappling with the fallen person the helmet has

been dislodged and he has seen the face and the eyes that were

described as, "Q)Cil@@:)!:1S E)@G5" . These were the only distinguishing

feature described by PW 1.

The son of PW 1, Gamini (PW 2) has come out running and the

suspect on the ground had shouted "63c::lOeD 63c::lOeD" to the other suspect

who by this time had moved towards the road and he has shot at PW 2

Gamini with a pistol but missed, and then that person has fled on foot.

PW 2 had come and assisted PW 1 by taking the firearm away,

however, the suspect who fell on the ground has taken a grenade and

hurled which did not explode. Then he has escaped from PW 1 and while

4

.'

getting away has thrown the second grenade to the crowd that had

gathered in front of the shop and fled from there. The second grenade

which exploded is what caused the death of Kailani Kaushalya

Hapugoda the grandchild of PWI and the daughter of PW 2, and

Subasinghe Arachchige Percy Subasinghe a passerby. The explosion

has caused injuries to about ten people. According to the prosecution

witnesses the incident has taken about 10 to 15 minutes and the

injured have been taken to the hospital and two deaths were confirmed

to have been caused due to the explosion.

It is contended on behalf of the counsel for the appellant that the

learned trial judge has not considered the infirmities relating to the

identification of the accused. The counsel for the respondent contended

that there was positive identification and the means of identification

was also established by the prosecution.

PW 1 has very clearly stated that he saw the face of the appellant

when the helmet was dislodged when they were grappling with each

other on the ground for more than five minutes and at very close

proximity. (page 231). He has described the appellant as having eyes

like a ~t:ll@m> in page 148 of the brief which seems to be the only

special feature he remembers of the suspect.

PW 1 and PW 2 have identified the appellant at the identification

parade without any hesitation. There is no direct allegation that was

established that the suspect was shown before the ID parade to the

prosecution witnesses, however, the accused in his dock statement has

made a general statement to the effect that many people saw him and

that his photographs were taken at the police station.

From the evidence it was established that the inside of the wine

store was well lit so was the outside. Adjoining the wine store was the

grocery shop that the son of PW 1 was conducting business and their

house was beyond that grocery shop a few feet away. On the opposite

side of the liquor shop was the fish vendor and this area was also well

lit. There is no doubt about the sufficiency of the available light at that

time of the night, as the evidence discloses that it was a well illuminated

place.

PW 15 Upa/i Weerathunga the owner of Honda Civic Motor Cycle

No 138-136 CD has given evidence that on 10.05.96 around 3.00 pm

his motor cycle was borrowed with the documents of the motor bike by

Lionel Jayasingha, (the appellant) to go to Veyangoda, who has promised

to return the motor bike in the night or the following morning. As it

was not returned as promised he has gone looking for the motor cycle

to the appellant' s house and found the house closed without anyone

there. After discovering that the appellant has gone on the cycle with a

person called Pradeep (the 1st accused), he has visited Pradeep and has

ultimately traced the vehicle at the Gampaha police station. After

several visits to the appellants house, the documents of the Motor Cycle

has been collected from the mother of the appellant and subsequently

he has collected the motor cycle from the Magistrate's Court of

6

Gampaha. The appellant has admitted borrowing the motor cycle from

PW 15 in his Dock Statement.

PW 2 Gamini has testified corroborating the evidence of his father

PW 1. After hearing his father calling @eDJ6t:i5,@l:s:lJ@6t:i5 he has come

running to see the father on the ground with the appellant. He has taken

the T 56 away from the father and has hit the suspect from the butt of

the rifle and later he has witnessed the suspect biting the hand of Police

Constable Sunil who has come to their aid and then the appellant has

taken something out of the Jerkin he was wearing and there has been

a loud explosion and he has seen his wife and daughter injured, he too

had been hurt with injuries to his ears and legs. He had taken the

injured to hospital where his child was pronounced dead.

It transpired that the identification parade was held a few months

after the incident. However, PW 1 and PW2 both were able to identify

the appellant as the person who was with the T 56 rifle and who threw

the grenade and the special identification was the unusual size of the

eyes of the suspect.

PWI and PW 2 both have evidenced that they saw the face of the

appellant when the helmet he was wearing was dislodged and under

what circumstances it was dislodged. This evidence was

uncontradicted. There is no doubt cast with the conclusion of the trial

judge regarding the identification of the accused by the prosecution

witnesses.

7

Another ground of appeal is the failure of the trial Judge to

consider the contradictions of the prosecution case.

On a perusal of the contradictions and omissions in this case it is

obvious that they are of a trivial nature that has not affected the

credibility of the witnesses.

Some of the contradictions that were marked are as follows;

In page 178 it was the evidence of PW1 that the business for the

day was not concluded in the liquor shop when the incident occurred,

but the fact that it is recorded that the door of the store was closed and

PW 1 was counting money ,was marked as a contradiction. (V 1).

In page 186, in the non summary inquiry PW 1 is supposed to

have said that the two suspects who came to the shop sat near the

counter, when in fact it was that they were standing near the

counter.(V2) ( emphasis added)

Some of the omissions highlighted are as follows;

In cross examination in page 400 of the brief PW 2 has stated that

when he hit the appellant with the butt of the rifle, one shot landed on

his face and when the helmet got dislodged, he saw the face and

recognized the suspect. The fact that this being not recorded in his

statement to the police is highlighted as an omission.

8

In page 183 the fact that there is no mention about a motor cycle

being parked outside the shop in the police statement. In pages 390 to

392 PW 2 stating that he came through the grocery shop when he heard

PW 1 shouting @cx)@6~ not being recorded in the police statement dated

12.0S.1996.In page 410 the fact PW 2 stating that the distinct feature

for him to remember the accused being the size of his eyes being bigger

than a normal person, this fact not being recorded in the police

statement. In page 416, in the police statement it is recorded that the

grenade that was in the hand of the accused was thrown, whereas in

evidence he has stated it was taken from inside the jerkin. In page 188

the fact that it is not recorded that it was the rider of the motor cycle

who went near the iron door.

The Learned Judge has painstakingly considered the highlighted

contradictions and omissions that were marked and concluded that

they did not go to the root of the case and that it did not affect the

credibility of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.

On a perusal of the contradictions and omissions, which have

been referred to in this jUdgment, I do not see any material

contradictions that has affected the prosecution case. By these

contradictions and the omissions the credibility of the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses has not been affected. Thus, I find that the trial

judge's conclusion is a sound evaluation.

It was contended that the appellant was not identified by the

prosecution witnesses. PW 2 has corroborated the evidence of PW 1.

Their evidence has sufficiently established the identity of the appellant

9

', '

and the act of committing the offences which culminated in the deaths

of the deceased and the offence pertaining to count no 13. Some

evidence regarding the identification is as follows;

The evidence of PW 15 has also been considered by the trial judge

which established that it was the appellant who took his motor cycle

which was later found at the scene of the crime, and that the appellant

who promised to return the motor cycle was absconding following the

incident without any cogent reason.

Another ground of appeal is that the learned trial Judge has failed

to consider the dock statement in the correct perspective.

It is correct that the learned judge has not specially, in detail,

referred to the dock statement, which when perused shows that the

appellant whilst admitting borrowing the motor cycle from PW 15,

absolves himself of the incident ,stating that the motor cycle was

borrowed by the 1 51 and 3rd accused to go to the liquor store. There is

no explanation why an attempt was not made to locate the motor cycle

and hand it back to PW 15, or why the accused was out of circulation

and could not be located by the police officers after such a terrible

incident when the motor cycle which he borrowed was also found at the

scene of crime.

11

; . :

In P.P.Jinadasa V Attorney General CA 167/2009 decided on

21.11.2011 Sisira de Abrew,J set out the following guidelines when

dock statements are to be evaluated.

1. If the Court believes the dock statement it must be acted upon.

2. If the dock statement raises a reasonable doubt in the mind of

the Court about the prosecution case, defence must succeed.

3. Dock statement should not be used against another accused.

In the instant case, one cannot say that the learned trial Judge

has not considered the dock statement, as it is seen that in page 43 of

the Judgement it is clearly stated that although the accused denied the

charges against him he has failed to create a doubt in the prosecution

case, which establish that the Dock Statement was considered by the

learned trial Judge.

On a perusal of the dock statement it is apparent that it has not

made any adverse impact on the prosecution case. The learned High

Court Judge has referred to the dock statement and correctly rejected

it stating that it did not create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution

case. Thus, it has not caused any injustice to the appellant nor has it

created a doubt in the prosecution case. Therefore, as the trial judge

has considered the dock statement, the ground of appeal that the dock

statement was not considered by the learned trial judge is not tenable.

It is also noted that the delay in holding of the identification

parade was due to the delay in taking the suspect into custody. The

learned Trial Judge has stated that although there is an issue how the

12

,,' "

identification parade was taken, there is no issue regarding the

identification of the suspect by the witnesses, with which statements

this court agree.

When considering the totality of the evidence it is clear that the

trial judge has carefully evaluated and analysed the evidence and had

concluded the guilt of the accused appellant.

For the above given reasons, there is no necessity to interfere

with the judgement of the learned High Court Judge and accordingly, I

affirm the conviction and the sentence. The Appeal is dismissed.
