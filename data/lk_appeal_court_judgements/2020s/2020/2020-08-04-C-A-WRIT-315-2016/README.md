Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

This case has a chequered history.

J.D. Liyanage made a statutory declaration marked 1R1 under

section 18 of the Land Reform Law, No.1 of 1972, as amended

(LRC Law). The Land Reform Commission (LRC) made a

statutory determination dated 28.02.1974 marked 1R2 under

section 19(1)(a) of the LRC Law, specifying the portion of land

the Petitioner was permitted to retain, i.e. fifty acres of the estate

including the tea factory situated thereon. Thereafter, the

statutory determination was gazetted on 30.09.1976 in the

gazette marked 1R3(a), but notably excluding the tea factory.

Predominantly due to the exclusion of the tea factory in the land

he was permitted to retain, J.D. Liyanage filed a writ application

seeking to quash by certiorari the gazette 1R3(a) and to compel

the LRC by mandamus to deliver possession of the land

including the tea factory to him. This Court, by Judgment dated

04.09.1981 marked P8, decided that the first statutory

determination dated 28.02.1974 is the lawful statutory

determination made under section 19(1)(a) of the LRC Law, and

quashed the purported second statutory determination gazetted

in 1R3(a) but refused mandamus. Let me quote the relevant

portion of the Judgment of Justice Atukorale (with Justice

Colin-Thome agreeing) for convenience.

There remains for consideration application No.217/80.

One relief sought is for a writ of certiorari quashing the

statutory determination published in Government Gazette of

30.9.1976 P3. On a perusal of the affidavits and the

6

counter-affidavits, the documents filed and also the file

maintained by the Commission which was made available

to us at the hearing, it seems clear that the Commission has

on 28.2.1974, in terms of S.19(1)(a) of the Land Reform

Law, made a statutory determination specifying the portion

of land that the petitioner should be permitted to retain.

According to this determination he has been allowed to

retain 50 acres of the estate including the tea factory.

Subsequently at the instance of the Member of Parliament

for Baddegama at that time and the then Minister, the

Chairman of the Commission appears to have varied this

determination. This varied determination is set out in the

letter P2 and has been published in the Gazette P3. It

deprives the Petitioner of the portion that he was originally

allowed to retain by the Commission. S.19(1)(a) of the Land

Reform Law enacts that the Commission shall as soon as

practicable make a determination (called the statutory

determination) specifying the portion which the statutory

lessee (in this case, the petitioner) shall be allowed to

retain. In making this determination the Commission is

obliged to take into consideration the preferences expressed

by the declarant in his declaration. In his declaration the

petitioner stated his preference to retain the portion where

the tea factory was situated. There is no doubt that the

determination made by the Commission on 28.2.1974 was

the lawful statutory determination under S.19(1)(a). The law

contemplates only one statutory determination. This

determination cannot in my view be varied by the Chairman

of the Commission. I am therefore of the opinion that the

7

determination published in the Government Gazette P3 is

ultra vires and is of no legal force, and must be quashed.

(emphasis added)

Thereafter, the LRC, instead of gazetting the aforesaid lawful

statutory determination, which the LRC is bound in law to do

under section 19(1)(b) of the LRC Law, vested the land including

the tea factory in the 3rd Respondent, the Sri Lanka State

Plantations Corporation, by the gazette marked P3. The LRC did

so within six months of the Court of Appeal Judgment. In my

view, this is an affront, if not a challenge, to the authority of the

Court. The said actions of the LRC are unlawful. From the

abovementioned Judgment it appears political and ministerial

interference in the function of the LRC is the reason for this

outrageous conduct.

The 3rd Respondent, in turn, leased out the land together with

the tea factory to the Petitioner by the Lease Agreement marked

P4.

In my view, when this Court held that the statutory

determination dated 28.02.1974 is the lawful statutory

determination made by the LRC under section 19(1)(a) of the

LRC Law, the LRC should have published the said statutory

determination in the gazette. There is no discretion in this

regard; it is a mandatory requirement. Section 19(1) of the LRC

Law enacts:

19(1) The following provisions shall apply on the receipt by

the Commission of a statutory declaration made under

section 18:

8

(a) The Commission shall, as soon as practicable, make a

determination, in this Law referred to as a statutory

determination, specifying the portion or portions of the

agricultural land owned by the statutory lessee which

he shall be allowed to retain. In making such

determination the Commission shall take into

consideration the preference or preferences, if any,

expressed by such lessee in the declaration as to the

portion or portions of such land that he may be allowed

to retain.

(b) The Commission shall publish the statutory

determination in the Gazette and shall also send a

copy thereof to such lessee by registered letter through

the post. Such determination shall be final and

conclusive, and shall not be called in question in any

court, whether by way of writ or otherwise. (emphasis

added)

It appears, even up to now, the LRC has not gazetted the

statutory determination. In other words, there is no statutory

determination in the eyes of the law in respect of the statutory

declaration made by J.D. Liyanage many moons ago!

In more recent years however, wiser counsel has prevailed, and

the LRC has had several correspondence with the 3rd

Respondent and the Petitioner requesting them to hand over the

tea factory to the LRC in order for it to be returned to J.D.

Liyanage and his heirs, but to no avail.

9

In the meantime, J.D. Liyanage and his heirs had

unsuccessfully engaged in several lawsuits to regain possession

of the tea factory.

However, upon the death of J.D. Liyanage, in a testamentary

case filed in the District Court of Galle, a settlement was

reached between the LRC and the heirs of J.D. Liyanage to hand

over possession of the land in dispute including the tea factory

to the latter. A Plan was also prepared in the testamentary case

to identify the area in question.

It is noteworthy that the 3rd Respondent, in whom the land

including the tea factory was purportedly vested by the LRC,

does not object to the re-vesting of the land along with the tea

factory. If I may repeat, the Petitioner is the lessee of the 3rd

Respondent, not of the LRC.

It is in this context the then President of the Republic, by the

gazette dated 06.06.2014 marked P7, partly revoked the P3

gazette in order to return the portion of land inclusive of the tea

factory to the heirs of J.D. Liyanage.

The Petitioner, who is the lessee of the 3rd Respondent, has filed

this application against the LRC and the Minister of Lands

seeking to quash by certiorari the P7 gazette, more than two

years and three months after its publication, on the basis it is

null and void because the reason stated in P7 for revocation is

non-existent and incoherent. The said reason in the P7 gazette

is non-compliance with such terms and conditions relating to

consideration for the vesting in such Corporation whereas the P3

10

gazette says No terms or conditions are laid down as regards

consideration. This is a valid argument by the Petitioner.

Nevertheless, as I have already stated, prior to the P7 gazette,

the P3 gazette was published in violation of the mandatory

provisions of the LRC Law. Therefore, the P3 gazette, insofar as

it relates to the tea factory and the adjacent land thereto, is null

and void.

Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [1961] 3 ALL ER

1169 at 1172 states:

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only

bad, but incurably bad. There is no need for an order of the

court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void

without more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to

have the court declare it to be so. And every proceeding

which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You

cannot put something on nothing and expect it to stay there.

It will collapse.

This passage was referred to with approval by G.P.S. de Silva J.

(later C.J.) in Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera [1982] 1 Sri Kantha

LR 164 at 168-169, Sharvananda J. (later C.J.) in Sirisena v.

Kobbekaduwa, Minister of Agriculture and Lands (1978) 80 NLR 1

at 182, and Sripavan J. (later C.J.) in Leelawathie v.

Commissioner of National Housing [2004] 3 Sri LR 175 at 178.

Sharvananda J. in Sirisena v. Kobbekaduwa, Minister of

Agriculture and Lands (supra) at 182 quotes the following portion

of Hailsham (4th Edition) Vol. I, paragraph 27:

11

No legally recognised rights found on the assumption of its

validity should accrue to any person even before the act is

declared to be invalid or set aside in a Court of Law.

If the P3 gazette, insofar as it relates to the tea factory and the

adjacent land, is a nullity, then there is no necessity to quash

the subsequent P7 Gazette. All that flows from a nullity is

automatically null and void.

It is hackneyed that writ is a discretionary remedy. A party

cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court as of right.

Even if a party is entitled in law to the relief sought, the Court

can, taking all the circumstances into account, refuse relief.

This principle is eminently befitting to the instant case.

Wade in Administrative Law (11th Edition) at pages 249-250

states:

the act may be clearly void but the court may be unwilling

(and in some cases not empowered) to grant the necessary

legal remediesThe court may hold that the act or order is

invalid, but may refuse relief to the applicant because of his

lack of standing, because he does not deserve a

discretionary remedy, because he has waived his rights, or

for some other legal reasonSimilarly with remedies

withheld in discretion: the court may hold that an attack on

the validity of some act or order succeeds, but that no

remedy should be granted. The court then says, in effect,

that the act is void but must be accepted as valid.

12

De Smiths Judicial Review (8th Edition) at page 1006 states:

The general approach ought to be that a claimant who

succeeds in establishing the unlawfulness of administrative

action is entitled to be granted a remedial order. The court

does, however, have discretionin the sense of assessing

what is fair and just to do in the particular caseto

withhold a remedy altogether or to grant a declaration

(rather than a more coercive quashing, prohibiting or

mandatory order or injunction which may have been sought

by the claimant) or to grant relief in respect of one aspect of

the impugned decision, but not others.

In the unique facts and circumstances of this case, I refuse to

grant the relief sought by the Petitioner.

The application of the Petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
