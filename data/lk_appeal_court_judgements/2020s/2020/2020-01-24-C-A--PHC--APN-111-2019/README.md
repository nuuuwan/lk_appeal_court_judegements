HON. JUSTICE K.K. WICKREMASINGHE

We have heard the submissions of both Counsel in support of their

respective cases. The Petitioner in this case has made a preliminary

objection in the High Court in terms of the Supreme Court Rule 34. It

was on the basis that the Respondent in the High Court case has not filed

their written submissions although several dates were given by the

learned High Court Judge.

The Respondent has failed to show due diligence in taking necessary

steps (filing of written submissions). Learned Counsel for the Petitioner

submits that on the previous day the learned High Court Judge has

already made an order stating that the application will be dismissed if

steps are not taken to file written submissions.

However, on the following day the State Counsel was absent due to her

sickness. Considering that, the learned High Court Judge dismissed the

objection of the Petitioner.

In terms of Rule 34 the Court is vested with discretion to decide on the

matter. The words mentioned is "the Court may". Therefore, the learned

High Court Judge has acted within her discretion provided in the rule.

What the learned High Court Judge mentioned on the previous day does

not amount to an order of dismissal and it was only an anticipatory

action. Hence there is no prima facie case established by the Petitioner

to issue notice to Respondents.

HON. JUSTICE K. PRIYANTHA FERNANDO
