Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.

Counsel: Vidura Ranawaka with Menaka Warnapura

for the Petitioner.

Vikum de Abrew, S.D.S.G., for the 1st, 2nd, 4th,

5th and 10th Respondents.

Rohan Sahabandu, P.C., with Hasitha

Amarasinghe for the 6th and 8th Respondents.

Argued on: 22.07.2020

Decided on: 02.09.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The subject matter of this application is Lot 1031, as depicted in

the Plan marked 1R1. This Lot abuts Lot 1032, which was given

to the Petitioner on a long lease by the State. The Petitioner

states she had been in possession of both Lots as one unit until

she was forcibly evicted from Lot 1031 on 03.06.2015 by her

political rivals.

By P14 issued by the 3rd Respondent, it is clear a decision was

taken to alienate 20 perches of Lot 1031 to the 9th Respondent

4

and 29 perches to (the Anuradhapura branch of) the All Ceylon

Buddhist Congress (hereinafter referred to as the Buddhist

Congress) on a preferential basis. Subsequent documents such

as V7 and V8 go to show that an extent of 30.08 perches was

identified to be alienated to the Buddhist Congress.

By P18, the 1st Respondent claims to have alienated the said

portion to the Buddhist Congress, in accordance with the

established procedure for disposing of State lands.

It is an admitted fact that the 6th-8th Respondents, who are said

to be office-bearers of the Buddhist Congress, were allowed by

one or several of the 1st-5th Respondents to construct a

permanent building on Lot 1031. The construction of the

building had accordingly commenced but was stopped due to

the filing of this application.

The fact that such a decision was taken has been admitted by

inter alia the 6th and 8th Respondents in paragraph 25 of the

statement of objections.

V6 issued by the 1st Respondent goes to show that Lot 1031 had

been in the unauthorised possession of the Petitioner when the

decision was taken to set apart 30.08 perches to the Buddhist

Congress vide V7.

By V7, the 1st Respondent also informed the Municipal

Commissioner of the Anuradhapura Municipal Council that

ownership of the land lies with the Buddhist Congress.

5

The Petitioner does not seek a writ of mandamus directing the

1st-5th Respondents to take steps to alienate Lot 1031 to the

Petitioner on a long lease or otherwise.

By filing this application, the Petitioner seeks to quash by

certiorari the decisions of the 1st-5th Respondents to alienate Lot

1031 to the 9th Respondent and/or the All Ceylon Buddhist

Congress-Anuradhapura branch without following the proper

procedure, and direct the said Respondents by mandamus to

follow the procedure laid down in the Land Manual for the

disposing of State lands on preferential basis.

As a public-spirited citizen keen to see the law obeyed by all in

the interest of all, the Petitioner has locus standi to maintain

this application vide Wijesiri v. Siriwardena [1982] 1 Sri LR

171.

Section 199 of the Land Manual inter alia sets out the procedure

to be followed in such alienations. This section has been

produced marked P22. In summary, according to this section,

on the written sanction of the subject Minister, when lands are

identified to be alienated on a preferential long lease basis, such

a proposal shall be gazetted so as to notify the general public

that they may object to such a move. The Minister shall take a

final decision only after considering the objections, if any, of the

public. Possession of the land cannot be handed over until such

steps are taken.

The Respondents do not say section 199 is inapplicable in this

instance or that the said procedure was followed before delivery

of possession of the land to the 6th-9th Respondents.

6

Instead, learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General appearing for

the 1st-5th Respondents informed the Court at the argument that

the said Respondents will follow the stipulated procedure before

executing the long lease. This means the 1st-5th Respondents

have not complied with the proper procedure in handing over

possession of Lot 1031 or part of it to the 6th-9th Respondents to

construct a permanent building thereon. This is ultra vires.

State lands cannot be alienated on long lease without following

the proper procedure; failure to do so is a violation of the Public

Trust doctrine vide Sugathapala Mendis v. Chandrika

Kumaratunga [2008] 2 Sri LR 339 at 352.

I grant the reliefs to the Petitioner as prayed for in paragraphs

(b)-(f) and (i) of the prayer to the petition.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs.
