Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

In terms of Section 247B(1) of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, as amended,

(the Ordinance), a Municipal Council may impose and levy a tax on any trade

carried on within the administrative limits of that Council.1 Section 247B(2)

specifies that the said tax shall be paid annually and shall be determined

according to the annual value of the premises at which that trade is carried on.

By a notice marked P2 issued by the 2nd Respondent, the Municipal

Commissioner, Dehiwela - Mount Lavinia Municipal Council , the Petitioner had

been directed to pay a sum of Rs. 5000 per annum for the years 2011 2013 as

a tax in terms of Section 247B of the Ordinance, for carrying out a ldrahd,h at

premises No. 608, Galle Road, Ratmalana.

Aggrieved by the said notice P2, the Petitioner filed this application seeking a

Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to issue the said notice P2.

The issue that arises for the determination of this Court in this application

therefore is whether the 2nd Respondent acted ultra vires the provisions of

Section 247B of the Ordinance when he issued the notice marked P2 to the

Petitioner.

1 The Sinhala text of Section 247B(1) reads as follows: hus uy k.r iNdjl md,k iSud ;=, lrf.k hk hus lraudka;hla fjkqfjka noaola kshufldg wh lsrsu tA uy k.r iNdj jsiska l, yelsh.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner has challenged the

imposition of the said tax on the following three grounds:

a) The Petitioner is not carrying out a trade at the said premises and

therefore Section 247B has no application to the said premises;

b) The Sinhala text of Section 247B uses the word, lraudka;, which the

Petitioner argues means industry as opposed to trade, and that the

Petitioner is not carrying out an industry at the said premises;

c) The notification by the 1st Respondent marked P1 declaring the various

lraudka; which would be liable to pay the said tax is ultra vires the

provisions of Section 247B.

As the issue to be determined relates to the imposition of a tax, it would be

useful to set out at the outset the law that would be applicable when

considering a taxing statute.

Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes2 states that:

Statutes which impose pecuniary burdens are subject to the same rule of

strict construction. It is a well-settled rule of law that all charges upon the

subject must be imposed by clear and unambiguous language, because in

some degree they operate as penalties: the subject is not to be taxed

unless the language of the statute clearly imposes the obligation3, and

language must not be strained in order to tax a transaction which, had the

legislature thought of it, would have been covered by appropriate words.

2 P. St. J. Langan, Maxwell on The Interpretation of Statutes (12th Edition), page 256. 3 Russell v. Scott [1948] A.C. 422, per Lord Simonds.

In a taxing Act, said Rowlatt J., one has to look merely at what is clearly

said. There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax.

There is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to

be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used.4

The above quotation as contained in Maxwell on The Interpretation of

Statutes5 was cited with approval by the Supreme Court in The Manager, Bank

of Ceylon, Hatton v. The Secretary, Hatton Dickoya Urban Council.6

The following paragraph from N.S. Bindras Interpretation of Statues7 explains

the approach that should be adopted when interpreting a taxing statute:

It is well-settled that words in a taxing statute should be construed in the

same way in which they are understood in ordinary parlance in the area in

which the law is in force. It is no doubt true that in construing fiscal

statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax, one must have

regard to the strict letter of the law.8

In construing tax statutes, if there is any ambiguity of language, the

benefit of that ambiguity must be given to the assessee. Statutes which

impose pecuniary burden or penalties have to be construed strictly and if

on a certain point such a statute is silent or its language is ambiguous, the

doubt is to be resolved by adopting the construction which is beneficial to

the tax-payer and which avoids inconsistency and repugnance among its

various provisions or to any constitutional provision.9A construction which

would have the effect of making a person liable to pay the same tax twice

in respect of the same subject-matter would not be adopted unless the

words were very clear and precise to the effect.10The principle is that in a

taxing statute, wherever there is ambiguity of language, the ambiguity

must be resolved in favour of the person to be taxed rather than the

taxing authority.11

In Sohli Eduljee Captain (Secco Brushes Corporation) v. Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue,12 the Supreme Court, having cited several local

and foreign judgments, held as follows:

Express and unambiguous language is absolutely indispensable in

Statutes passed for the purpose of imposing a tax for such a statute is

always strictly construed. In a Taxing Statute, therefore if two

constructions are possible, one in favour of the assessee and the other in

favour of the assessor, the Court must adopt the construction which is

favourable to the assessee.

In Perera & Silva Ltd. v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue,13 the

Supreme Court reiterated the above position when it referred to the following

paragraph from C. N. Beatie - Elements of the Law of Income and Capital Gains

Taxation at page 2;

It has frequently been said that, there is no equity in a taxing statute. This

means that tax being the creature of statute, liability cannot be implied

under any principle of equity but must be found in the express language of

9Chandra Industries v. State of Punjab [1972] 29 STC 558, p 563. 10Daulat Ram v. Municipal Committee, Lahore AIR 1941 Lah 40, p43. 11Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition (supra), page 883. 12 (1974) 77 NLR 350, page 352. 13 (1978) 79(2) NLR 164 at 167-168.

some statutory provision. The ordinary canons of construction apply in

ascertaining the meaning of a taxing statute: the only safe rule is to look

at the words of the enactments and see what is the intention expressed by

these words. If in so construing the statute the language is found to be so

ambiguous that it is in doubt whether tax is attracted or not, the doubt

must be resolved in favour of the taxpayer, because it is not possible to fall

back on any principle of common law or equity to fill a gap in a taxing

statute. The subject is not to be taxed unless the words of the taxing

statute unambiguously impose the tax upon him. However, this does not

prevent the court from construing a taxing statute against the subject,

where that appears to be the correct interpretation of a provision the

meaning of which it may be difficult to understand. Difficulty does not

absolve the court from the duty of construing a statute; it is only when

ambiguity remains after the statute has been properly construed that the

court is entitled to decide in favour of the taxpayer.

I shall now consider each of the arguments presented by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner.

The first argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is that

the Petitioner is a service oriented Statutory Corporation functioning on the

basis of zero profit, and that the Petitioner does not carry out any trade at the

said premises. The Petitioner has been established by the Ceylon Electricity

Board Act No. 17 of 1969, and has been entrusted with the duty to develop and

maintain an efficient, coordinated and economical system of electricity supply

for the whole of Sri Lanka. In terms of Section 11 of the said Act, it shall be the

duty of the Petitioner inter alia to generate or acquire supplies of electricity

and to distribute and sell electricity in bulk or otherwise. Section 12 provides

7

inter alia that the Petitioner has the power to purchase electrical energy in

bulk, and to do all other things which, in the opinion of the Board, are

necessary to facilitate the proper carrying on of its business.

In Strouds Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases,14 the following has been

set out under the word, Trade:

Trade is not only etymologically but in legal usage a term of the widest

scope. It is connected originally with the word tread and indicates a way

of life or an occupation. In ordinary usage, it may mean the occupation of

a small shopkeeper equally with that of a commercial magnate. It may

mean a skilled craft. Although it is often used in contrast with a

profession, the word trade is used in the widest application in the

appellation trade unions.

Formerly, trade was used in the sense of an art or mystery, e.g. that of

a brewer, or a tailor, but now trade has the technical meaning of buying

and selling.

But trade may have a larger meaning so as to include manufacturers.

So, the business of a telegraph company is a trade as regards house

duty.

It is not essential to a trade that the persons carrying it on should

make, or desire to make, a profit.

The scope of the word trade has been considered in Income Tax in Sri Lanka

by E. Gooneratne as follows:15

14 6th Edition, Volume 3, at page 2691. 15 E. Gooneratne, Income Tax in Sri Lanka, page 53.

8

Trade has a wide meaning. The meaning has been extended further by

definition. The statutory definition is wider and includes every trade and

manufacture and every adventure and concern in the nature of a trade.

It is true that the Petitioner is providing a service to the Public. While it may

also be true that the Petitioner is not making profits by the re-sale of the

electricity either generated or purchased by the Petitioner, the fact of the

matter is that, that alone does not entitle the Petitioner to exemptions from

taxing statutes, unless an exemption is specifically granted. It is clear from the

provisions of the Act itself that a core function of the Petitioners business is

buying and selling electricity and that the Petitioner therefore trades in

electricity. For that reason, there cannot be any doubt that the Petitioner is

engaged in a trade.

However, in my view, the general nature of the Petitioners activities alone

does not make the Petitioner liable to the tax in terms of Section 247B in

respect of the premises described in P2. I am of the view that the Petitioner

would become liable to the said tax only if there is trade being carried out at

the premises referred to in P2. Such a distinction is important especially in

view of the fact that there may be premises occupied by the Petitioner on

which only a generation plant is situated, and where there is no trade being

carried out.

I shall now consider if there is any trade being carried out at the premises

referred to in P2. The Petitioner states that the said premises number 608,

Galle Road, Ratmalana, situated within the administrative limits of the 1st

9

Respondent Council is used as the Office of the Deputy General Manager

(Western Province South 1) of the Petitioner. According to the Petitioner, the

scope of work carried out at the said office covers planning, rehabilitation,

maintenance, and protection in respect of the supply of electricity to

consumers.

In their Statement of Objections, the Respondents had disputed the fact that

only the above activity is carried out at the said premises and had submitted

marked 1R2 and 1R3, electricity bills issued by the Petitioner for which

payment had been made at the said Office, thus demonstrating that

commercial activity, i.e. acceptance of money for the services provided by the

Petitioner, takes place at the said Office. In the written submissions filed on its

behalf, the Petitioner has stated that the said Office also serves as a dedicated

place where consumers can pay their electricity bills and that one of the

particular activity carried out at the premises is collection of payments from

consumers for the electricity that one had consumed. The fact that the

Petitioner is engaged in the collection of revenue due to it, is proof that the

said premises are used for a trade. In these circumstances, it cannot be stated

that the Petitioner does not carry out a trade from the said premises. I must

however add a word of caution i.e. the above conclusion reached by me is

peculiar to the facts and circumstances of this application, and that whether a

trade is being carried on at any particular premises would depend on the facts

of each case.

Taking into consideration the totality of the material that has been placed

before this Court, I am of the view that the Petitioner is in fact carrying out a

trade at the premises in respect of which P2 has been issued.

10

The second argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is

that even though Section 247B, which was introduced by the Municipal

Councils (Amendment) Act No. 42 of 1979 uses the word trade in the English

text of the Amendment Act, the Sinhala text uses the word lraudka;h, which

the Petitioner argues, means industry, and that, as the Petitioner is not

carrying out an industry at the said premises, the Petitioner is not liable to pay

the aforementioned tax. He therefore submitted that the decision contained in

P2 is in any event ultra vires the provisions of the Act.

The Petitioner has referred to the judgment of this Court in the case of Crest

Gems Ltd v. The Colombo Municipal Council16 where a similar argument was

made in respect of taxes charged by the respondent under Section 247B of the

Municipal Councils Ordinance from the petitioner who was engaged in the

business of buying and exporting gems, and other export related activities in

the premises in question. It was held in that case that there was an

inconsistency between the English and Sinhala provisions of Section 247B of

the Municipal Councils Ordinance, and that where there is such an

inconsistency between the two languages, the Sinhala language text prevails.

This Court held further that the activity of buying and exporting gems is:

a trade or fj,|du in Sinhala and does not fall within the meaning of the

word lraudka;h since the petitioner does not manufacture in the said

place.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondents submitted that even

though the Sinhala text of the Amendment Act has used the word lraudka;h,

the said word has not been used in the context of an industry, but in the

16[2003] 1 Sri LR 370.

11

context of a trade, and therefore submitted that there is no inconsistency

between the Sinhala and English texts of the said Section. This position is

supported by the following definition of the word, trade in the Malalasekera

English Sinhala Dictionary:

fj<odu" fj<fy<odu" jHdmdrh" ^w;alus& Ys,amh" lsishus jHdmdrhl fhoqk wh

^iuia;hla jYfhka& (ts) fj<| iq<x" lraudka;h fj<odfuys fhfo" fj<odus l"

.=gs neg wekqus neKqus yqjudre lrk t in f.jsul fldgila jYfhka yqjudrej

Thus, lraudka;h can be described as a trade in the ordinary sense, a fact which

has not been considered by this Court in Crest Gems Ltd v. The Colombo

Municipal Council.17 Therefore, I am unable to agree with the restrictive

position taken by this Court in Crest Gems Ltd v. The Colombo Municipal

Council18, that taxes under Section 247B of the Municipal Councils Ordinance

cannot be imposed on a trade where no manufacturing is being carried out in

the premises in question.

In a subsequent case involving the same parties, Crest Gems Ltd v. The

Colombo Municipal Council and others,19two judges of this Court held as

follows:

It is asserted by the Appellant that the Respondent can impose a tax

only In respect of a 'Karmanthaya' as stated In the Sinhala text. It is

pertinent to note that the Municipal Council Ordinance does not give an

interpretation to the word 'Karmanthaya'. Therefore the Respondent

adverted to the dictionary meaning of the said word 'Karmanthaya'.

17 Ibid. 18Ibid. 19 CA (PHC)16/2000; CA Minutes of 14th January 2016.

12

It is contended by the Respondent that in the case cited by the Appellant

to vit. Crest Gems Ltd v. The Colombo Municipal Council, Her Ladyship

has not considered the dictionary meaning of Karmanthaya, and hence

this Court is not bound to follow the same.

Therefore the Respondent has adverted Court to the dictionary meaning

of Industry. Industry means Velandama, viyaparaya, Karmanthaya.

Hence it is crystal clear the word TRADE means KARMANTHAYA, which

also means velandama (business) or sale.

Whilst one must not strain the language in a statute to impose a tax liability,

one must equally be mindful not to strain in favour of the taxpayer when the

wording is clear. In view of the material referred to above, I am satisfied that

the word lraudka;h is one of the words to which the word trade can be

translated into, and that the said word lraudka;h in Section 247B does not,

and should not be restricted to an industry. In the said circumstances, I am of

the view that there is no inconsistency or contradiction between the Sinhala

and English texts of the said Section, and that the liability of the Petitioner

remains unaffected.

I shall now consider the final argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for

the Petitioner, which is that the notification issued by the 1st Respondent

marked P1 declaring the various lraudka; which would be liable to pay the

said tax is ultra vires the provisions of Section 247B, as the Petitioner is not

engaged in an industry at the said premises and to classify its office as an

industry is illegal.

13

The Petitioner has produced with his petition marked P1, a notice issued by

the 1st Respondent and published in Government Gazette No. 1542 dated 19th

March 2008, by which the particular lraudka; that are liable to pay tax in

terms of Section 247B have been specified. In essence, the purpose of P1 is to

set out in detail the trades that in the view of the Respondents are liable for

the tax in terms of Section 247B. In paragraph 6 of its petition, the Petitioner

has admitted that the 1st Respondent is empowered to impose and levy a tax

on any lraudka; carried on within its administrative limits in terms of Section

247B of the said Ordinance.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondents drew the attention of this

Court to item 2 of P1 (page 859) which sets out the various activities that are

considered to be lraudka; or trade, for the purposes of Section 247B. The

learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondents submitted that the activity

carried out by the Petitioner at the said premises would come under items 2,

68 and 205 of the activity set out in P1, which are re-produced below:

(ii) lraudka; jsIfhys noq whlsrSu - 247wd j.ka;sh lraudka; jsIfhys noq whlrkq ,nk ia:dk my; oelafjS' 02' ldrahd, nvqndysrdosh .nvd lsrSu iy$fyda jslsKSfus ia:dkhla mj;ajdf.k

.dia;= fyda fj<o jHdmdr jsIhfhys noq fkdf.jk by;ska i|yka fkdjq

jdKsP jHdmdrhla mj;ajdf.k hdu

It was the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondents

that the Petitioner is carrying on a commercial office at the aforementioned

14

premises by virtue of accepting payment of electricity bills, a fact which has

now been accepted by the Petitioner. He submitted that the carrying out of a

commercial operation at the said Office would attract the tax in terms of

Section 247B(1) and therefore that the contention of the Petitioner is

misconceived.

Having examined P1 and the documents produced by the Respondents

marked 1R4 1R6, I am satisfied that, even though the Petitioner had

initially claimed that the said office is being used only as the Office of the

Deputy General Manager, commercial activity is in fact being carried out at the

said premises, and that by virtue of item 68 of P1, the Respondents are

entitled to impose on the Petitioner, the tax in terms of Section 247B.

It is in the above background that the Petitioner has submitted in its written

submissions that P1 is ultra vires the provisions of Section 247B of the

Ordinance, for the reason that the Petitioner is not engaged in an industry at

the said premises as none of the said activities referred to in P1can be

classified as a lraudka;. Quite apart from this not being the case that the

Petitioner presented to this Court in its petition, I have already taken the view

that a trade can be classified as a lraudka;h, and therefore elaborating in P1

the different types of trade that are liable for the said tax, in my view, is not

ultra vires the power vested in the Respondents by Section 247B of the

Ordinance.

Taking into consideration all of the above matters, I am of the view that the

Petitioner is liable for the payment of the tax in terms of Section 247B, and

15

that the issuance of P2 is not ultra vires the provisions of the Ordinance

and/or the powers of the 2nd Respondent.

There is one final matter that I wish to advert to. The learned Presidents

Counsel for both parties moved that this Court proceed to consider this matter

and deliver judgment even though the Supreme Court has granted leave to

appeal to the Petitioner in respect of a judgment of the Provincial High Court

arising from an issue, said to be identical to the issue that is before this Court.

It must however be noted that this Court has not been apprised of the nature

of the activity carried out at the premises which is the subject matter of the

said appeal. Furthermore, this Court has not been apprised of the questions of

law on which leave to appeal has been granted, nor has a copy of the petition

of appeal been filed of record. In any event, the conclusion I have reached is

specifically with regard to the activity carried out at the particular premises in

respect of which P2 had been issued.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to grant the

relief prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
