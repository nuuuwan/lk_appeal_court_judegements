Argued on: 03.07.2020

Decided on: 25.08.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The father of the 4th and 5th Respondents was the owner of the

land known as Bowhill Estate in Nawalapitiya when the said

land was deemed to vest in the 3rd Respondent, the Land Reform

Commission, in terms of section 3(2) of the Land Reform Law,

No.1 of 1972, as amended.

The Land Reform Commission then vested the said land of

approximately 247 acres in extent in the Petitioner, Janatha

Estates Development Board, by the Gazette marked X2 dated

31.05.1982.

Thereafter, the 1st Respondent, the Minister of Lands, by the

Gazette marked B dated 11.08.2006, revoked the earlier Gazette

marked X2 in respect of 100 acres of the land, and alienated the

said 100 acres to the 4th and 5th Respondents by the Deed

marked C dated 14.12.2006.

4

The 4th and 5th Respondents filed case No.21371/L in the

District Court of Colombo against the Petitioner and its

Chairman in 2007, seeking declaration of title to the land,

ejectment of the Petitioner and its Chairman therefrom, and

damages.

The Petitioner in paragraph 18 of the petition states The

Petitioner and its Chairman filed answer dated 5th December

2007 in which they have wrongfully and/or mistakenly admitted

that after the purported Gazette No.1457/22 marked B the Land

Reform Commission became the owner of the said extent of 100

acres.

After the trial, the District Court entered Judgment in favour of

the 4th and 5th Respondents.

The appeal filed against the said Judgment was dismissed by

the High Court of Civil Appeal on 27.09.2013, due to want of

appearance by the Appellant who is the Petitioner in this

application.

The Petitioner did not file a relisting application in the High

Court of Civil Appeal against the said dismissal, as the Petitioner

was entitled in law to do, in order to have the appeal relisted. As

seen from paragraph 21 of the petition, this was intentional.

In paragraph 21 of the petition, the Petitioner states pending

the said appeal, an application was made by the 4th and 5th

Respondents for the execution of the decree entered in the said

District Court of Colombo No.21371/L and the Petitioner has

agreed on 7th of September 2011 to handover the said extent of

5

100 acres to the 4th and 5th Respondents and the application for

the execution of the money decree to be considered thereafter.

The 4th and 5th Respondents have taken steps for the execution

of the money decree entered in the said District Court case. In

this process, the 4th and 5th Respondents sought to seize

premises No.175, Vauxhall Street, Colombo 2, which the

Petitioner says is a State-owned property.

The application of the 2nd Respondent, the Attorney General, to

release the property from seizure was dismissed by the District

Court, and, on appeal, the High Court of Civil Appeal affirmed

the said Order.

The appeal filed before the Supreme Court in 2015 against the

said Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal is now pending

before the Supreme Court.

It is significant to note that the said appeal to the Supreme

Court is in respect of the execution proceedings and not against

the District Court Judgment or the Judgment of the High Court

of Civil Appeal dismissing the appeal for want of appearance.

It may be recalled that revocation of the Gazette marked A in

respect of 100 acres by the Gazette marked B was done on

11.08.2006. The Petitioner has come before this Court more

than 11 years after the said revocation, invoking the writ

jurisdiction of this Court to (a) quash the Gazette marked B by

way of a writ of certiorari, and (b) prohibit by way of a writ of

prohibition the 4th and 5th Respondents from taking over

possession of the said 100 acres and taking any steps to dispose

6

of the property in Colombo 2 seized in the execution of the

decree of the Colombo District Court case No.21374/L.

The pivotal argument of learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner before this Court is the said revocation of the vesting

Order in respect of 100 acres of the land by the Minister is a

nullity, because the basis of the said revocation is unsustainable

in law, in that, although the Minister has done so in terms of

section 27A(4) of the Land Reform Law, the Minister could not

have invoked the said provision, as the vesting of the land in the

Petitioner by the Gazette marked A was not subject to any terms

or conditions relating to consideration.

If this is the position of the Petitioner, why did the Petitioner

admit in the District Court case No.21371/L that after the said

revocation of the 100 acres by the Gazette marked B, the Land

Reform Commission became the owner of the said extent of

land? The Petitioner could have simply taken up this position at

that time. How can the present Chairman of the Petitioner now

say in his supporting affidavit to this Court that the former

Chairman mistakenly admitted this fact? The Petitioner did

not take up this position not only in the said District Court case

but even in subsequent litigations, until it was taken up 11

years later for the first time in this application.

As I said earlier, the Petitioner in the petition itself admits that

after the District Court Judgment, when execution proceedings

were set in motion, the Petitioner agreed to hand over the said

extent of 100 acres to the 4th and 5th Respondents. The present

Chairman of the Petitioner does not say this is also a mistake.

7

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner also submits that

the Judgment of the High Court of Civil Appeal dismissing the

appeal filed against the District Court Judgment on the ground

of want of appearance is null and void, as it is contrary to

section 769(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, citing Suweyal v.

Podinona [2017] BLR 100 in support.

In the first place, the Petitioner does not seek such a relief in the

prayer to the petition. However, this shall not be taken to mean

that had such relief been sought in the prayer, this Court could

have considered it in this writ application.

A Judgment entered by a competent Court cannot be attacked

collaterally. There is a procedure laid down by law to have a

Judgment set aside. If this submission of the Petitioner is

entertained, the losing party need not prefer an appeal against

the Judgment within the prescribed time but can challenge it at

the execution of the decree or in another proceedings. This is

not possible.

In Suweyal v. Podinona (supra), the appeal was dismissed by the

High Court of Civil Appeal for want of appearance of the

Appellant, as in the instant case. Thereafter, the Appellant in

that case rightly filed a relisting application before the same

Court, which was also dismissed. Then, the Appellant filed an

appeal before the Supreme Court against the said dismissal.

The Supreme Court set aside the Order of dismissal and directed

the High Court of Civil Appeal to relist the appeal, as the High

Court of Civil Appeal had failed to comply with section 769(2) of

the Civil Procedure Code in dismissing the appeal.

8

The facts and circumstances of Suweyals case and this case are

totally different. In Suweyals case, due procedure was followed

by the Appellant in order to have the dismissal of the appeal set

aside. In the instant case, evidently, no such procedure has

been followed.

I reject this submission made on behalf of the Petitioner.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner only makes a

collateral attack against the Order of dismissal made by the

Appellate Court. Going one step further, learned Senior State

Counsel appearing for the 1st and 2nd Respondents submits that

a collateral attack on the District Court Judgment is possible, as

the District Court could not have gone into the matter presented

by the Petitioner in this application. The question is not

whether the District Court could have decided the matter but

whether the Petitioner took up the matter before the District

Court, and why the Petitioner did not challenge the impugned

Order made by the Minister by way of a writ application at that

time? At the argument, learned Senior State Counsel supported

the application of the Petitioner. However, contrary to this

position, in the statement of objections of the 1st Respondent

Minister dated 08.08.2018, the Ministers action is fully

defended and dismissal of the Petitioners application is sought.

The 2nd Respondent, the Attorney General, has not filed a

separate statement of objections. I reject the submission of

learned Senior State Counsel.

It is clear a lot of water has passed under the bridge since the

revesting of the said 100 acres and the filing of this application.

The Petitioner is manifestly guilty of laches.

Writ is a discretionary remedy. The party who invokes the writ

jurisdiction of this Court shall act with promptitude. The

Petitioner cannot wait 11 long years to come before this Court to

challenge a decision.

This is not a case of the Petitioner not knowing of the alleged

unauthorised act committed by the Minister at the time it was

committed. The Petitioner knew of it from the very outset and

acknowledged and acquiesced to it. This, the Petitioner did, not

before its subordinates or friends, but before the District Court

through its lawyers. The District Court, after the trial,

recognised the 4th and 5th Respondents entitlement to the land

in suit, which was affirmed on appeal, and the Petitioner

accepted this or at least did not challenge it at that time.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submits that

delay shall not be an absolute bar when the impugned decision

is a nullity, and draws the attention of the Court particularly to

the Judgment in Bogawanthalawa Plantation Ltd. v. Minister of

Public Administration, Home Affairs and Plantation Industries

[2004] 2 Sri LR 329, where an identical Order was successfully

challenged before this Court in a writ application despite delay.

If the writ jurisdiction of this Court is invoked after an

inordinate delay, the Petitioner shall explain the delay in his

petition. That is a threshold requirement. The Petitioner in the

10

instant matter has not done so. Nor does it do so even at this

stage of the case.

In the abovementioned Bogawanthalawa Plantation Ltd. case,

the delay was only 9 months whereas in the present case the

delay is 11 years. Still the Petitioner in the said case explained

the delay. The impugned revesting Order in that case was

gazetted on 19.11.1999 and the Petitioner convinced the Court

that it became aware of the Order for the first time by letter

dated 13.06.2000, by which the Petitioner was requested to

hand over the property. The explanation was accepted by the

Court to hold that the Petitioner was not guilty of laches. It is

on this basis the objection to delay was overruled vide page

334 of the said Judgment.

There are two intervenient Respondents in this case.

The 6th (intervenient) Respondent in its plaint filed in the District

Court of Nawalapitiya case No.387/2013/L stated the land it

occupies is different to the land which is the subject matter of

the District Court of Colombo case No.31371/L.

The Lease Agreement between the Petitioner and the 7th

(intervenient) Respondent was entered into after the revesting

Order had been made.

There are a number of pending cases among the parties before

different Courts stemming from this dispute. The parties shall

resolve their outstanding issues in those Courts.

In the unique facts and circumstances of this case, the

Petitioner cannot succeed in this application.

I dismiss the Petitioners application with costs.
