The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari

to quash the arbitral award made by the 1st Respondent in terms of the

Industrial Disputes Act.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The 2nd Respondent was an employee of the Petitioner, the Sri Lanka

Transport Board, and was attached to the Gampola Depot of the Petitioner in

the capacity of a driver. On 27th July 2008, the 2nd Respondent had been

involved in a fatal road accident, for which proceedings had been instituted

against the 2nd Respondent in the Magistrates Court. The Petitioner had

issued the 2nd Respondent a charge sheet in respect of the said accident and

having conducted a disciplinary inquiry, terminated the services of the 2nd

Respondent with effect from 21st November 2008. The appeal filed by the 2nd

Respondent had been rejected by the Appeal Board of the Petitioner.

3

Pursuant to a complaint made by the 2nd Respondent to the Department of

Labour, the Minister of Labour, acting in terms of Section 4(1) of the Industrial

Disputes Act, had referred the following dispute for resolution by arbitration:

Whether the penalties imposed on Mr. M.G.P.Jayalath in terms of the

Disciplinary Order dated 21st November 2008 issued by the Senior

Disciplinary Officer and the Appeal Order dated 21st October 2009 issued

by the Appeal Board Chairman of the Nuwara Eliya Regional Office of the

Sri Lanka Transport Board regarding a road accident that had taken

place while he was in service as a driver in the Gampola Depot of the said

Board are justified and, if not justified to what relief he is entitled.

It appears that the only penalty imposed on the 2nd Respondent had been his

dismissal from service. Even though the above reference required the 1st

Respondent Arbitrator to examine whether the termination of services of the

2nd Respondent was justified, it is clear from the proceedings held before the

1st Respondent on 2nd August 2013 that the 2nd Respondent was content if the

Petitioner was agreeable to pay the statutory payments due to the 2nd

Respondent, together with suitable compensation.

By his award dated 5th June 2017, marked P3, the 1st Respondent had held as

follows:

2014.03.31 osk fnSreuslrK l%shdj,sh wdrusN l< wjia:dfjsos b,a,quslre ;udg ,ensh hq;= jkaoshla fyda lreKd iy.; osukdjla fyda iu. wfkl=;a ish jHjia:dms; osukd ,nd.eksug;a" hf:dla; ishu oSukd b,a,quslre fj; ,ndoSug;a Y%s ,xld .ukd.uk uKav,fha ks;s{jre tl.;djh m< lsrSfuka wk;=rej fuu fnsreuslrKfha lghq;= ksudjg m;a lsrSu i|yd fomdraYjfha tl.;djh u; ;SrKh lf<us'

Dissatisfied by the said award relating to the payment of compensation, the

Petitioner filed this application, seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

award P3.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner presented three arguments.

4

The first argument was that the reference to arbitration is bad in law in view

of the provisions of Sections 44B(1)(c) and 44B(2) of the Industrial Disputes

Act, which reads as follows:

Section 44B(1)(c)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other written law, a

suit for the recovery of any sum due under this Act from any employer to

any workman shall be maintainable if it is instituted within two years

after that sum has become due.

Section 44B(2)

For the purposes of this section, sum of money includes, where any

benefit is due under this Act from an employer and where such benefit is

capable of being computed in terms of money, such amount as may be

determined by the court in which the action for the recovery of the value

of such benefit is brought.

The argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

arbitration proceedings had been initiated for the recovery of money, and

that as the reference to arbitration had been made after a lapse of two years

from the date of the Appeal Board decision, the reference to arbitration is not

in compliance with the provisions of Sections 44B(1)(c) and 44B(2). Quite

apart from the initiation of arbitration proceedings not being a suit, as

contemplated by the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, the dispute that

was referred for arbitration did not relate to the recovery of money, but to

the question of whether the termination of the services of the 2nd Respondent

was justified. Hence, this Court does not see any merit in the first argument

advanced on behalf of the Petitioner.

The second argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

Legal Officer of the Petitioner had not agreed to the payment of

compensation, as recorded by the 1st Respondent, and that the findings of the

1st Respondent to that effect is erroneous.

5

According to the proceedings of 31st March 2014, marked P2c, the 2nd

Respondent had indicated that he is not in a position to proceed with the

arbitration due to his personal difficulties, and agreed to the following:

th jsiokq fjkqjg Tyqg ,ensh hq;= jHjia:dms; oSukd blaukska ,nd .eksug tl.;ajh m< lr isgS' tu osukd ,nd .eksug wjYH mshjrka i|yd j.W;a;rldr mdraYjh fjkqfjka fmkS isgsk kS;s{ uy;aush jsiska ks;Hdkql+, lghq;= lsrSug tl.;ajh m< lr isgS' ta wkqj f.dkqfjs l%shdldrs;ajh k;r lr isgS' The agreement of the Legal Officer was therefore to expedite the payment of

all statutory payments, and not to the payment of compensation.

Arbitration proceedings had not been held thereafter for almost three years.

The inquiry had recommenced on 15th February 2017 -vide P2e where the

following had been recorded:

Thus, it is clear that the Petitioner had not agreed to the payment of any

compensation to the 2nd Respondent.

In the written submissions filed on behalf of the 2nd Respondent, it has been

stated that on 31st March 2014 as well as on 15th February 2017, the

Petitioner agreed to pay all statutory payments due to the 2nd Respondent,

6

and that the 1st Respondent agreed to make the award on that basis. The 2nd

Respondent has not taken up the position that the Petitioner, through its

Legal Officer agreed to pay compensation, in addition to the statutory

payments due to the 2nd Respondent. In these circumstances, there is no

doubt that the Petitioner has not agreed to pay any compensation to the 2nd

Respondent, and that the award of the arbitrator is factually incorrect.

This Court is mindful that in this application, it is exercising its writ jurisdiction

as opposed to its appellate jurisdiction, and to the fact that this Court is not

concerned with the rights and wrongs of the decision, but only whether such

decision is legal or not. However, it is an accepted fact that a Court can

intervene when there is no evidence to support the finding of the

administrative body. This issue has been discussed in Administrative Law by

Wade and Forsyth1 in the following manner:

No evidence does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It extends

to any case where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not reasonably

capable of supporting the finding; or where, in other words, no tribunal

could reasonably reach that conclusion on that evidence. This no

evidence principle clearly has something in common with the principle

that perverse or unreasonable action is unauthorised and ultra vires. It

also has some affinity with the substantial evidence rule of American law,

which requires that findings be supported by substantial evidence on the

record as a whole.

In Samarakoon Jayasundera Mudiyanselage Kiri Banda vs. A.H. Irangani

Samaraweera and Others2, this Court held as follows:

Generally, courts exercising judicial review do not review errors of fact

made by administrative bodies/officials, unless those errors of fact are

linked to the assumption of the administrative body's jurisdiction i.e.

jurisdictional errors of facts.3 [R v. Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington

1 11th Edition; page 227. 2CA (PHC) 98/2007; CA Minutes of 19th October 2018. 3 See Barnett H, Constitutional and Administrative Law, 3rd Edition, Routelege 2014 at page 763 where it is stated that a court will be reluctant to review a non-jurisdictional error of fact because it is

7

Rent Tribunal (1951) 2 K. B. 1 at 6; Walter Leo v Land Commissioner 57

NLR 178]. One exception to this general principle is the no evidence

rule'.

Having referred to the above passage from Administrative Law by Wade and

Forsyth, this Court went on to state as follows:

The observations made by the text writers about this ground of judicial

review have been adopted and endorsed by the Supreme Court in

Kiriwanthe v Navaratne [(1990) 2 Sri LR 393 at 409] and in Nalini Ellegala

v Poddalagoda [(1999) 1 Sri LR 46 at 52].

In Hasseen v Gunasekara and others [CA Application No. 128/86 C.A.M.

02.10.1995] this court considered an order of the Rent Board of Review,

affirming an order of the Rent Board which had been "arrived at without

an adequate evaluation of the evidence and by failing to take into

consideration relevant items of evidence which could have influenced the

finding" and held the Rent Board as well as the Board of Review had

"erred in law by failing to take into account relevant items of evidence in

arriving at the finding" and therefore quashed the orders of the Rent

Board as well as of the Board of Review.

Therefore, when a factual finding by an administrative body is not

supported by the evidence on record, or has been made ignoring relevant

and established evidence on record, the court has the ability to exercise

judicial review.

Having carefully considered the proceedings before the 1st Respondent, this

Court is of the view that the 1st Respondent has clearly erred when he arrived

at the finding that the Petitioner had agreed to the payment of compensation

to the 2nd Respondent. In the said circumstances, this Court is in agreement

with the second argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, and is of

the view that, that part of the award P3 dealing with the payment of

compensation, is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

presumed that administrative decision makers have all the factual information on hand and are best equipped to make factual determinations.

8

The final argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that in any

event, the award is uncertain, in that the amount of compensation has not

been specified and therefore, the award is not capable of being given effect

to, or enforced. This Court is of the view that an award must be specific and

must be capable of being given effect to, which unfortunately is not the case

in this application. The learned Counsel for the 2nd Respondent has accepted this position and

submitted that whether compensation should be paid, and if so, the quantum

of such compensation has been left to the discretion of the Petitioner. This

Court is of the view that an Arbitrator cannot leave the payment of

compensation at the discretion of the employer. Where an arbitrator is of the

view that compensation must be paid, quite apart from supporting such a

conclusion with the evidence led before him, the Arbitrator must state the

quantum of such compensation, and the basis for the calculation of such

compensation. The 1st Respondent has done neither.

In Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe4 it was held by Chief Justice

H.N.G.Fernando as follows:

I hold that when the Industrial Disputes Act confers on an Arbitrator the

discretion to make an award which is 'just and equitable', the Legislature

did not intend to confer on an Arbitrator the freedom of a wild horse. An

award must be 'just and equitable' as between the parties to a dispute;

and the fact that one party might have encountered 'hard times' because

of personal circumstances for which the other party is in no way

responsible is not a ground on which justice or equity requires the other

party to make undue concessions. In addition, it is time that this Court

should correct what seems to be a prevalent misconception. The

mandate which the Arbitrator in an industrial dispute holds under the

law requires him to make an award which is just and equitable, and not

necessarily an award which favours an employee. An Arbitrator holds no

licence from the Legislature to make any such award as he may please,

for nothing is just and equitable which is decided by whim or caprice or

by the toss of a double-headed coin.

The Supreme Court, in Singer Industries (Ceylon) Limited vs The Ceylon

Mercantile Industrial and General Workers Union and Others5 agreeing with

the above observations in Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe6 held as

follows:

It is a cardinal principle of law that in making an award by an arbitrator

there must be a judicial and objective approach and more importantly

the perspectives both of employer as well as the employee should be

considered in a balanced manner and undoubtedly just and equity must

apply to both these parties.

In Heath and Company (Ceylon) Limited vs Kariyawasam,7 the Supreme Court

held that in the assessment of evidence, an arbitrator appointed under the

Industrial Disputes Act must act judicially. Where his finding is completely

contrary to the weight of the evidence led before him, such a finding can only

be described as being perverse and his award is liable to be quashed by way of

Certiorari.

In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union vs Nestle Lanka

Limited,8 this Court held as follows:

The arbitrator to whom a reference has been made in terms of section 4

(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act as amended is expected to act judicially.

He is required in arriving at his determinations to decide legal questions

affecting the rights of the subject and hence he is under a duty to act

judicially. Although such arbitrator does not exercise judicial power in the

strict sense, it is his duty to act judicially.

It has been stressed that such an arbitrator's function is judicial in the

sense that he has to hear parties, decide facts, apply rules with judicial

5 [2010] 1 Sri LR 66. 6 Supra. 7 71 NLR 382 8 [1999] 1 Sri LR 343 at page 348.

10

impartiality and his decision is objective as that of any court of law,

though ultimately he makes such award as may appear to him to be just

and equitable. Vide the decision in Nadaraja Limited and 3 others. v.

Krishnadasan and 3 others9.

Thus, there is no evidence or material which has been adduced which

could support the aforesaid inference and findings reached by the fourth

respondent. Findings and decisions unsupported by evidence are

capricious, unreasonable or arbitrary.

Regretfully, the 1st Respondent has lost sight of his role as an Arbitrator, and

made an award which is vague, uncertain, and is not enforceable. In these

circumstances, this Court is in agreement with the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner that the award is liable to be quashed for not being certain.

Before concluding, this Court must note that there has been an inordinate

delay on the part of the Petitioner in the payment of gratuity to the 2nd

Respondent, which probably resulted in the reference to arbitration, and this

application. Although the services of the 2nd Respondent had been terminated

on 21st November 2008, and the Petitioner had undertaken before the 1st

Respondent to pay the gratuity that was due to the 2nd Respondent as far back

as 2014, the payment had been made only on 19th December 2018.10 Given

the dire circumstances faced by persons such as the 2nd Respondent who lose

their employment, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner must act

responsibly and comply at all times with the provisions of the Payment of

Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983.

In the above circumstances, this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari quashing that

part of the award P3 that deals with the payment of compensation and ex-

gratia payment to the 2nd Respondent. This Court makes no order with regard

to costs.
