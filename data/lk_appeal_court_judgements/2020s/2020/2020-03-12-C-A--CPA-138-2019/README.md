ACHALA WENGAPPULI,J.

In this application, the accused-petitioner invokes the revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court, seeking to set aside the order of the High Court

of Colombo dated 24.10.2019 pronounced in case No. HC 165/19 by which

the Court had refused enlarging him on bail. The accused-petitioner was

indicted before that Court for the alleged possession and trafficking in of

10.41 grams of Heroin. After service of the indictment on the accused-

petitioner, his trial was fixed on 9th and 10th of December 2019.

The accused-petitioner, in support of his application for bail, had

submitted to the High Court that Section 8 of the Convention Against Illicit

Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act No.1 of 2008

had made the provisions of the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997 are applicable to

2

applications for bail and Section 16 of the Bail Act made it mandatory to

enlarge a person who was kept in detention for over a period of one year.

Since the accused-petitioner is in remand for well over two and half years,

he should be enlarged on bail because he need not satisfy the Court of

existence of any exceptional circumstances, a legal requirement no longer

applicable, in view of the statutory provisions of Section 8 of the Act No.1

of 2008.

The High Court had rejected the accused-petitioner's interpretation

of law on the basis that Section 2 of the Act No. 1 of 2008 had clearly

excluded its applicability over the offences that are stated in part III of the

Third Schedule of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended by Act No.13 of 1984.

In seeking to revise the said order of the High Court, the accused-

petitioner submitted to this Court that he supports his young family, had

been incarcerated for over two years pending trial and the Hon. Attorney

General had failed to issue a practice direction identifying the exceptional

circumstances and thereby prevented a prospective applicant for bail in

placing reliance upon such circumstances. The accused-petitioner

therefore urges that this Court could treat the non-availability of a

definition to the term "exceptional circumstance" as an exceptional

circumstance in itself.

3

The accused-petitioner had invoked revisionary jurisdiction of this

Court to revise the impugned order of the High Court. Therefore, this

Court should consider whether the said impugned order is tainted either

with any illegality or any irregularity.

It is undisputed that the accused -petitioner is indicted before the

High Court for the alleged commission of offences that are described in

Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended and read with Column II of Part III of the Third Schedule to the

said Ordinance.

Section 2 of the Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs

and Psychotropic Substances Act No.1 of 2008 had described the several

offences it had created. The proviso to Section 2 however, had excluded

certain offences from the scope of the said Act as it is stated that;

"Provided further, that the above provisions shall not be

applicable to offences to which Part III of the Third Schedule

to the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance

(Chapter 218) applies."

The accused-petitioner's contention that Section 8 of the said Act

made the provisions of the Bail Act are applicable to a suspect or an

accused who is indicted under Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

4

Ordinance is therefore directly in conflict with the express statutory

provision contained in the proviso to Section 2 of Convention Against

Illicit Traffic in Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.

The accused-petitioner's contention that Section 8 of the said Act

made the provisions of Bail Act are applicable to him too is clearly is an

instance where he had misled himself since it only categorises the offences

that are described in Section 2 of Convention Against Illicit Traffic in

Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act as cognizable and non-

bailable offences.

In delivering the order denying bail to the accused-petitioner, the

High Court had correctly applied the relevant statutory provisions. The

impugned order is therefore a legally correct valid order and there was

no irregularity alleged.

It is in Thamodarampillai v Attorney General (2004) 3 Sri L.R. 180,

the then Supreme Court emphasised the presence of exceptional

circumstances in considering bail pending appeal. Understandably their

Lordships did not venture to define what is meant by exceptional

circumstances are, conferring a wide discretion on the Courts of first

instance for consideration of bail in respect of each application on its own

and peculiar circumstances.

5

The judgment of The Queen v Corne lis Silva 74 NLR 113, stated that

the grounds that are "common to many accused persons" will not qualify to

be considered as exceptional and therefore the personal circumstances as

urged by the accused-petitioner, though highlighted for the first time

before this Court, fail to satisfy the requirement imposed on him by

Section 83(1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended.

In the circumstances, the application of the accused-petitioner to

revise the impugned order of the High Court is refused. His application is

accordingly dismissed.

No order for costs.
