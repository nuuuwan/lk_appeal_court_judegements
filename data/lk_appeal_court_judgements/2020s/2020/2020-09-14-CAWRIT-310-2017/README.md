The Petitioner has filed this application seeking inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash

the arbitral award marked P5 made in terms of the Industrial Disputes Act by the 1st

Respondent.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner states that by an internal memorandum dated 3rd November 2008

addressed to its Chairman, the Chief Internal Auditor of the Petitioner had sought

approval to deploy two Office Assistants to assist the Investigation Teams that detect

the illegal tapping of electricity. According to the said memorandum, their services

were required for the purpose of carrying ladders etc.1 The 4th Respondent, whose

father was employed in the house of the then Chairman of the Petitioner, and who

by then had submitted his curriculum vitae with a covering letter titled application

for a suitable post, had been considered for the said post by the Petitioner.2 After an

interview, the 4th Respondent had been recruited to the post of Office Assistant

(ldrahd, ldrah iydhl) in the Petitioner Company, and had been issued with a letter of

appointment dated 21st November 2008, to the post of Office Assistant. The 4th

Respondent had continued to hold the said post until his complaint to the

Department of Labour in 2012.

It is not in dispute that the Petitioner had served as a Maintenance Assistant in his

previous employment, and that he was knowledgeable in the repair and

maintenance of domestic electrical appliances. It is also not in dispute that the 4th

Respondent had been assigned to the Investigation Teams of the Petitioner that was

engaged in the detection of illegal tapping of electricity.

In his complaint made to the Department of Labour in 2012, the 4th Respondent,

while admitting that he was recruited as an Office Assistant, had stated that from day

one, he worked as an Electrician (jsoq,s ldrauslfhl=) in the Investigation Team. He had

stated further that he was transferred from the Investigation Team in November

2011, but that on an appeal filed by him, the said transfer had been cancelled. The

4th Respondent goes onto state that he had been transferred again on 1st February

2012 to the Moratuwa Branch where he assumed duties but that the work assigned

to him was that of an Office Assistant. The grievance of the 4th Respondent was that

having worked as an Electrician, his new assignment as an Office Assistant amounted

to a demotion.3 The said complaint had thereafter been inquired into by the

Department of Labour, but in the absence of a resolution of the said dispute, the

Minister of Labour, acting in terms of the powers vested in him in terms of Section

4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act, had referred the following dispute for resolution

by arbitration:

This would be a convenient place to consider the role of an Arbitrator appointed

under the Industrial Disputes Act. Section 17(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act reads

as follows:

When an industrial dispute has been referred under section 3(1)(d) or section

4(1) to an arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, he shall make all such

inquiries into the dispute as he may consider necessary, hear such evidence as

may be tendered by the parties to the dispute, and thereafter make such award

as may appear to him just and equitable.

The wide powers and duties conferred on an arbitrator were considered by the

Supreme Court in Brown & Company v. Minister of Labour,5 where it was held as

follows:

Arbitration under the Industrial Disputes Act is intended to be even more

liberal, informal and flexible than commercial arbitration, primarily because the

Arbitrator is empowered to make an award which is "just and equitable". When

an industrial dispute has been referred under Section 3 (1)(d) or Section 4(1) of

the Industrial Disputes Act to an Arbitrator for settlement by arbitration, Section

17(1) of the said Act requires such Arbitrator to "make all such inquiries into the

dispute as he may consider necessary, hear such evidence as may be tendered

by the parties to the dispute, and thereafter make such award as may appear to

him just and equitable". In my view, the word "make" as used in the said

provision, has the effect of throwing the ball into the Arbitrator's court, so to

speak, and requires him to initiate what inquiries he considers are necessary.

The Arbitrator is not simply called upon "to hold an inquiry", where the ball

would be in the court of the parties to the dispute and, it would be left to them

to tender what evidence they consider necessary requiring the arbitrator to be

just a judge presiding over the inquiry, the control and progress of which will be

in the hands of the parties themselves or their Counsel. What the Industrial

Disputes Act has done appears to me to be to substitute in place of the rigid

procedures of the law envisaged by the "adversarial system", a new and more

flexible procedure, which is in keeping with the fashion in which equity in English

law gave relief to the litigants from the rigidity of the common law. The function

5(2011) 1 Sri LR 305; Marsoof, J.

5

of the arbitral power in relation to industrial disputes is to ascertain and declare

what in the opinion of the Arbitrator ought to be the respective rights and

liabilities of the parties as they exist at the moment the proceedings are

instituted. His role is more inquisitorial, and he has a duty to go in search for the

evidence, and he is not strictly required to follow the provisions of the Evidence

Ordinance in doing so. Just as much as the procedure before the arbitrator is not

governed by the rigid provisions of the Evidence Ordinance, the procedure

followed by him need not be fettered by the rigidity of the law.

Chief Justice H.N.G.Fernando in Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe6 stated

as follows:

I hold that when the Industrial Disputes Act confers on an Arbitrator the

discretion to make an award which is 'just and equitable', the Legislature did

not intend to confer on an Arbitrator the freedom of a wild horse. An award

must be 'just and equitable' as between the parties to a dispute; and the fact

that one party might have encountered 'hard times' because of personal

circumstances for which the other party is in no way responsible is not a ground

on which justice or equity requires the other party to make undue concessions.

In addition, it is time that this Court should correct what seems to be a prevalent

misconception. The mandate which the Arbitrator in an industrial dispute

holds under the law requires him to make an award which is just and

equitable, and not necessarily an award which favours an employee. An

Arbitrator holds no licence from the Legislature to make any such award as he

may please, for nothing is just and equitable which is decided by whim or

caprice or by the toss of a double-headed coin.

This position was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Ceylon Tea Plantations

Company Limited vs Ceylon Estate Staff Union,7 where it was held that:

A just and equitable order must be fair by all parties. It never means the

safeguarding of the interest of the workman alone.

In Singer Industries (Ceylon) Limited vs The Ceylon Mercantile Industrial and

General Workers Union and others,8 the Supreme Court agreed with the

observations in Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe9 and held as follows:

It is a cardinal principle of law that in making an award by an arbitrator there

must be a judicial and objective approach and more importantly the

perspectives both of employer as well as the employee should be considered in a

balanced manner and undoubtedly just and equity must apply to both these

parties.

Thus, it is clear that the Arbitrator must take control of the proceedings, elicit the

material that is required for a determination of the question referred to him,

consider the material that is before him and arrive at a just and equitable order,

without favouring one party over another.

Proceedings had commenced before the 1st Respondent Arbitrator on 19th July 2014.

While the 4th Respondent had given evidence, the Petitioner too had led the

evidence of its Investigation Officer and an Executive from the Human Resources

Division. The parties had also been afforded an opportunity of filing written

submissions. The Petitioner has no complaint with regard to the manner in which the

proceedings were conducted by the 1st Respondent and the hearing afforded to the

Petitioner.

By his Award marked P5 dated 17th January 2017, the 1st Respondent had directed

the Petitioner as follows:10

Aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioner had repudiated the said Award by a

Notice of Repudiation dated 24th July 2017 in terms of Section 20 of the Industrial

quash the arbitral award P5, and the notice of award marked P7 published in the

Gazette. 12

Considering the fact that the role of an arbitrator is to deliver an order which is just

and equitable by both parties, it would be useful to understand the manner in which

an Arbitrator must evaluate the evidence placed before him.

In Heath and Company (Ceylon) Limited vs Kariyawasam,13 the Supreme Court held

that in the assessment of evidence, an arbitrator appointed under the Industrial

Disputes Act must act judicially. It was held further that where his finding is

completely contrary to the weight of evidence, such a finding can only be described

as being perverse and his award is liable to be quashed by way of Certiorari.

In All Ceylon Commercial and Industrial Workers Union vs Nestle Lanka Limited14

this Court held as follows:

The arbitrator to whom a reference has been made in terms of section 4 (1) of

the Industrial Disputes Act as amended is expected to act judicially. He is

required in arriving at his determinations to decide legal questions affecting the

rights of the subject and hence he is under a duty to act judicially. Although such

arbitrator does not exercise judicial power in the strict sense, it is his duty to act

judicially.

It has been stressed that such an arbitrator's function is judicial in the sense that

he has to hear parties, decide facts, apply rules with judicial impartiality and his

decision is objective as that of any court of law, though ultimately he makes

such award as may appear to him to be just and equitable. Vide the decision

in Nadaraja Limited and 3 others. v. Krishnadasan and 3 others.15

In Brown & Company v. Minister of Labour and Others16 the Supreme Court, having

referred to the following description of irrationality given by Lord Diplock in Council

of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service:17

By irrationality I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury

unreasonableness18. It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its

defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who

had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.

held that in my opinion, these words are applicable with equal force to the

discretionary powers exercised by an arbitrator . in an industrial arbitration under

Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

Thus, in arriving at a decision which is both just and equitable, it is clear that the

Arbitrator must act judicially and that his decision must be reasonable and rational.

The principal argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that

the Arbitrator has failed to consider the material placed before him by the Petitioner,

and that the award is not supported by the evidence that was led before the 1st

Respondent, thereby rendering the award arbitrary and irrational. Whether a Court

can intervene when there is no evidence to support the finding of the

administrative body has been discussed in Administrative Law by Wade and

Forsyth19 in the following manner:

No evidence does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It extends to

any case where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable of

supporting the finding; or where, in other words, no tribunal could reasonably

reach that conclusion on that evidence. This no evidence principle clearly has

something in common with the principle that perverse or unreasonable action

is unauthorised and ultra vires. It also has some affinity with the substantial

evidence rule of American law, which requires that findings be supported by

substantial evidence on the record as a whole.

In support of his argument, the learned Presidents Counsel adverted to several

documents that were placed before the 1st Respondent, which he submitted

established the position (a) that the 4th Respondent was employed in the capacity of

an Office Assistant; (b) that he continued to hold the said post at all times; and (c)

that the Petitioner was never entrusted with the duties of an Electrician.

I shall now consider the said material.

It is clear from the internal memorandum that was referred to earlier that the

requirement of the Petitioner was for the services of two Office Assistants. It is also

clear that the 4th Respondent was able to secure an interview with the Petitioner due

to his father being employed at the residence of the then Chairman of the Petitioner.

The 4th Respondent had submitted his application seeking employment in a post

commensurate with his qualifications, and after facing an interview for the post of

Office Assistant,20 the 4th Respondent had been requested to report for duty as an

Office Assistant.21 The Petitioner, by reporting to work on receipt of the said letter,

had accepted the offer of the Petitioner of an appointment as an Office Assistant.

The letter of appointment issued to the 4th Respondent to the post of Office Assistant

had been signed and accepted by the 4th Respondent without any reservation. Thus, I

am of the view that there cannot be any doubt that the appointment of the 4th

Respondent was as an Office Assistant.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that recruitment to the

post of Electrician (Grade III) is carried out after the publication of a notice in the

newspaper, and having afforded all those who respond to the said advertisement an

equal opportunity of being selected. Thus, recruitment to the post of Electrician is

not carried out in an ad-hoc manner similar to the manner in which the 4th

Respondent was selected, as referred to above, once again confirming that the

recruitment of the 4th Respondent could not have been to the post of Electrician.

What is more important is that an applicant for the post of Electrician must possess a

simple pass in Mathematics at the GCE Ordinary Level Examination, and should have

successfully completed a 3 year full time course either at the National Apprentice

20 Vide internal memorandum dated 18th November 2011, marked R33, at page 466 of X. 21 Vide letter dated 24th November 2008 marked R6 at page 421 of X.

10

and Industrial Training Authority or the Apprentice Institute, Katubedda or a similar

programme.22 It is admitted that the 4th Respondent did not possess any of the above

qualifications, and therefore, I am of the view that the 4th Respondent was not

eligible to be employed as an Electrician at the Petitioner.

The Petitioner has also produced the Job Description for the post of Electrician

(Grade III). I have examined the said document, and observe that the post is of a

highly technical nature, and include the following duties:

w;ajevshd lr h:d ;;ajhg m;alsrSug iyh jSu'

The duties that go with the post of Electrician is ample proof as to why the Petitioner

was seeking persons with the qualifications referred to earlier for the post of

Electrician. I have no doubt that the post of Electrician would have required a sound

technical knowledge of the subject, and that the 4th Respondent, who did not have

the educational qualifications required for the said post, could not have functioned

in the post of Electrician, even if he possessed the practical experience. One must

remember that the Petitioner is one of the two entities that have been entrusted

with the task of transmission of electricity in the Country, and that the Petitioner

simply cannot afford to allow unqualified personnel to perform tasks which need to

be performed by duly qualified personnel.

The following documents too establish that the post held by the 4th Respondent was

that of an Office Assistant:

22 Vide paper advertisement published in August 2009 marked R19, August 2010 marked R20 and January 2012, marked R4, at pages 444, 445 and 419, respectively, of X.

11

a) The identity card issued to the 4th Respondent in January 2009, and in January

2014 refer to the post of the Petitioner as an Office Assistant;23

b) Membership Certificate issued to the 4th Respondent by the Sri Lanka Nidhahas

Sevaka Sangamaya refers to the post of the Petitioner as an Office Assistant;24

c) In the Personal Loan Protection Application signed by the 4th Respondent in

January 2010, the post held by the 4th Respondent is specified as Office

Assistant ;25

d) The application of the 4th Respondent for a distress loan submitted in

December 2009 too refers to the post held by the 4th Respondent as Office

Assistant;26

e) The letters by which the Petitioner was informed of his salary increments prior

to the complaint in 2012 refer to the 4th Respondent as an Office Assistant.27

The position taken by the 4th Respondent before the Arbitrator was twofold. The first

is that at the time he assumed duties with the Petitioner in November 2008, the then

Chairman of the Petitioner had held out to him:

(a) That he is being recruited to the post of Office Assistant due to the absence of

vacancies in the post of Electrician;

(b) That he would however be entrusted with the duties of an Electrician;

(c) That he would be appointed to the post of Electrician once vacancies arose in

the said post.

Even if the above position is true, I am the view that the then Chairman of the

Petitioner did not have the legal authority to make the said representation,

23 Vide R21 and R9 at pages 446 and 424, respectively, of X. 24 Vide document marked R16, at page 440 of X. 25 Vide application dated 4th January 2010, marked R17, at page 441 of X. 26 Vide application dated 23rd December 2009, marked R18, at page 442 of X. 27 Vide letters dated 4th March 2010 marked R22, 22nd January 2011 marked R23, 6th December 2011 marked R24at pages 447, 449, 450 of X.

12

especially in the absence of the 4th Respondent possessing the qualifications required

for the post of Electrician. In any event, vacancies did arise in the post of Electrician

in August 2009, and August 2010, as borne out by the newspaper advertisements

published at that time,28 and if the version of the 4th Respondent was right, he should

have been appointed to the said post, either in August 2009 when the same person

was the Chairman, or August 2010. Thus, I am not inclined to accept the position of

the 4th Respondent.

The second aspect of the 4th Respondents position was that he was carrying out the

functions of an Electrician, and for that reason he should be appointed to the said

post. In support of this, the 4th Respondent had produced before the Arbitrator,

several plaints filed in the Magistrates Court against persons who had illegally

tapped electricity, where the 4th Respondent had been referred to as an Electrician.

While the circumstances under which this was done is not clear, even if the 4th

Respondents argument is accepted, I am of the view that the fact that he performed

the duties of an Electrician does not entitle the 4th Respondent to be appointed as an

Electrician. I certainly cannot subscribe to the view that a person who does not have

the entry qualifications to a post should be appointed to the said post, merely

because he carried out the functions of that post.

It is in the above factual circumstances that the 1st Respondent decided the

aforementioned question that was referred to him by the Minister in favour of the

4th Respondent, with the Petitioner complaining to this Court that the said decision is

not supported by the evidence that was led before the 1st Respondent, and therefore

the award is arbitrary and irrational.

This Court will now proceed to consider whether the award made by the Arbitrator is

just and equitable by both parties. I have examined the award of the 1st Respondent

P5 in the light of the above material that was referred to by the learned Presidents

Counsel, and observe that the Arbitrator has not considered the aforementioned

material that was available to him. He has arrived at his decision, primarily for two

reasons. The first is that the 4th Respondent was a clever young man who had carried

out the duties entrusted to him in an exemplary manner. This is borne out by the

following paragraph: 28 Vide R19 and R20, at pages 444 and 445, respectively, of X.

The second reason for the said decision is that the Investigation Team did not have

an electrician, and that this task was performed by the 4th Respondent.

The 1st Respondent has lost sight of the fact that every employee must, at the very

least, carry out the duties entrusted to him by his or her employer to the best of his

ability, and in a satisfactory manner. Doing so does not entitle him to benefits that he

is otherwise not entitled to. Furthermore, taking the position of the 4th Respondent

at its best, the mere fact that the 4th Respondent carried out the duties of an

Electrician does not make the 4th Respondent eligible to be appointed to the said

post, especially in view of the educational qualifications that are required for the said

post.

In these circumstances, this Court is in agreement with the submission of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner that the conclusion reached by the Arbitrator

that the 4th Respondent should be appointed to the post of Electrician is not

supported by the evidence placed before him. I must state that the 1st Respondent

has clearly taken into consideration matters which were irrelevant to the issue

before him. I am of the view that the decision of the Arbitrator is so unreasonable

and irrational that it is not a decision that a sensible person who had applied his

mind to the evidence available to him could have arrived at. The said decision is

therefore liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari.

There is one matter that I wish to advert to, even though the Petitioner has not

challenged the reference to arbitration. In terms of Section 4(1), the Minister must

form the opinion that there exists an industrial dispute, prior to making any

reference of such dispute for resolution by arbitration. The Minister would be guided

in this regard by the Commissioner General of Labour who therefore has the duty to

carefully consider if an industrial dispute has been made out by the complainant.

14

The complaint of the 4th Respondent to the Department of Labour was supported

only by the fact that he had been referred to as an Electrician in the plaints filed

before the Magistrates Courts. That being the position of the 4th Respondent, and in

the light of the material placed by the Petitioner, it does not appear that the Minister

had applied a judicial mind or even an objective mind, or with all due deference a

sensible mind to the issue before him, prior to making the reference. An inquiry by

an arbitrator can take several days, is a costly exercise and a strain on the limited

resources of the State, and therefore, is all the more reason why both the

Commissioner General of Labour and the Minister of Labour must examine matters

carefully prior to arriving at a decision whether a reference should be made. In my

view, this is a classic case where the Petitioner could have challenged the reference

of the Minister on the basis of it being irrational and unreasonable.

At this stage, I would like to refer to the judgment of this Court in Standard

Chartered Bank vs The Minister of Labour Relations and Manpower and Others,29

where this Court held as follows:

This Court is of the view that in terms of Section 4(1) of the Industrial Disputes

Act, the Minister is not obliged to refer for arbitration, each and every dispute

that he or she is presented with. The Minister must look at each request

objectively and exercise his discretion judiciously. The fact that the Minister has

a discretion is clearly established when one considers that the Minister may

refer for arbitration only if, he is of the opinion that an industrial dispute is a

minor dispute. How does he form an opinion that there exists an industrial

dispute and that such dispute is a minor dispute? Is it only by considering the

argument advanced by the employee or should the Minister also consider the

position of the employer, as well as any other matters that the Minister may

consider relevant? This Court, whilst not subscribing to the view that it is

mandatory for the Minister to obtain the views of all parties prior to making a

reference under Section 4(1), takes the view that in this application, given the

background circumstances such as the inquiry under the TEW Act, and the

litigation challenging the findings of the Inquiry Officer, the Minister was under

a duty to consider the documents X10, X11 and X12 prior to forming an

opinion that there exists an industrial dispute. Unfortunately, the Minister has

29 CA (Writ) Application No. 231/09; CA Minutes of 17th July 2019.

15

not done so, and therefore it is the view of this Court that the Minister has failed

to take into consideration relevant matters, prior to arriving at a decision.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st and 2nd Respondents had

submitted that in terms of Section 4(1), the consent of the parties is not required

for a reference and that this is an indication that the Minister does not have to

consult the other party, prior to making the reference to arbitration. Whilst

agreeing that the consent of the parties is not required, this Court is of the view

that this is not an indication that the Minister is not required to address his

mind in a judicial manner. If this Court may borrow the language used by the

Supreme Court in Municipal Council Colombo vs Munasinghe30 with reference

to the power of an arbitrator appointed under the Industrial Disputes Act, the

Minister or for that matter, no public official has the freedom of the wild horse

to do whatever he or she wants to. All exercise of statutory duties and functions

must be within the four corners of the statute that confers such duties and

functions, and any transgression will be dealt with in terms of the law.

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that the decision of the Arbitrator is

irrational, unreasonable and arbitrary. I therefore issue Writs of Certiorari in terms of

paragraphs (b) and (c) of the prayer to the petition quashing the award marked P5,

and the decision to publish the award in the Gazette, as reflected by P7. I make no

order with regard to costs.
