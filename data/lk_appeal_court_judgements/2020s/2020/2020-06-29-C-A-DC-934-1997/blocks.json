The share of said Nonchihamy had devolved on the 14 (a) Defendant. Therefore, the Original Plaintiff states that the Learned Trial Judge in his judgment dated 1997.10.22 had completely gone wrong, in fact and in law, and had decided that one Davith had 7 children. The Plaintiff states that it appears that the Learned Trial Judge had mi ~takenly considered Manis as Davith, and had arrived at an erroneous finding. But I strongly believe that Learned Trail Judge has decided it correctly. Shares of Davith and his son Manis were calculated by the trail Judge and given properly to their children.",
