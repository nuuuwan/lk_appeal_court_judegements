The Substituted-Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "Plaintiff")

instituted the above styled partition action to partition the land called as "Kongahawatta"

alias "Meegahawatta".

The present Plaintiff initially, was the original first Defendant when the case was filed in June 1981. However, since the original Plaintiff was unable to proceed with the action the present Plaintiff, who was the first Defendant earlier, by an amended Plaint dated 25.09.1992 moved Court to proceed with the action. Thereafter, rest of the Defendants also filed their respective amended statement of claims and the matter proceeded to trial on 2 admissions and 40 issues

The judgment was delivered by the Learned Trial Judge on 22.10.1997, where by making an order to partition the land in suit as per the schedule of shares contained therein for the reasons stated in the said judgment. The 29th Defendant-Appellant and the Plaintiff Appellant, have preferred two appeal to the Court of Appeal on 12th and 19th December 1997 respectively. against the said judgment as they were aggrieved by the same and arguing that, they were not been allotted correct shares in the said schedule of shares.

According to the Journal Entry dated 20.01.2012, it was informed to this Court that the Plaintiff Appellant is dead. After the substitution was done on the request of the 29th

Defendant- Appellant, it was indicated in all the documents and even in the Amended Caption, that the Plaintiff- Appellant, as the "Substituted- Plaintiff- Respondent". There was no application to confirm that the Substituted- Plaintiff has decided to withdraw or abundant the Appeal. The said Amended Caption could be considered as a typographical error. On the 21.06.2019 all parties agreed before us, to dispo~e this matter by way of Written Submissions. On that request Court allowed them to tender Written Submissions and conclude the arguments.

It is important to note that the substituted 29th Defendant-Appellant relates only to correctness of the calculation of the shares in the said judgment and challenging the findings

Page 3 of 8

in relation to the miscalculation of shares by the Learned Trial Judge. Therefore, the Substituted 29th Defendant - Appellant through this action aims to examine the said judgment in respect of the misdirection on the part of the Learned Trial Judge in arriving at his conclusions as to the shares of the parties. This Appellant does not challenge the other findings or conclusions of the Learned Trial Judge.

According to the amended Plaint, that the land in suit had been owned and possessed by three original owners. They were, Karonchi Appu, Bastian Appu allias Babappu and Seeman Appu in equal shares (1/3,d each). The Substituted 29th Defendant Appellant says, that only the rights of Seeman Appu have consequently resulted in the miscalculation of the shares. The said Seeman Appu had died leaving his widow and 6 children as his intestate heirs. The said Seeman Appu had a child named Salan Appu. The widow of Seeman Appu, namely Punchihamy had transferred her Yo share to 4 children of Salan Appu by virtue of Deed bearing No.2565 in the year 1886.

The said children of Salan Appu were entitled to a share of 1/3 x Yo x Yo each, (1/24) in addition to the said rights the said 4 children of Salan Appu had derived a further share of 1/144 each on the demise of their father Salon Appu. One of the children of Salan Appu had died unmarried and issueless and his rights also had devolved on his 2 sisters and out of the said 2 sisters, one sister called Karlina, in the year 1919 and on Deed No.28980 had transferred all rights, shares and interests to the other sister. The two children of Salan Appu aforesaid have derived a share of 1/24 + 1/72 = 4/72 = 1/18 each from and out of the land in suit.

The said rights of those 2 children of Salan Appu had devolved on to the present 1st Defendant

on a clear chain of deeds and thus the 1st Defendant (Original Plaintiff) was entitled to a share of 2/18 = 1/9 from and out of the corpus. The claim of the 29th Defendant-Appellant is that the 1st Defendant, Premaratne had transferred all his rights to her. The Appellant had adduced the deeds in relation to the said devolution of title unto her.

It was argued that the 29th Defendant Appellant has lost a substantial portion of the land due to the said misdirection and misinterpretation of the relevant evidence by the Learned Trial Judge

It is evident that one of the children of Salan ADDU had died unmarried and issueless and his rights also had devolved on his 2 sisters and out of the said 2 sisters, one sister called Karlina in the year 1919 and on Deed No.28980 marked as 29 V 5, had transferred all rights shares and interests to one Samaranayaka. Thus, on the said pleadings, it will be observed that the

two children of Salan ADDU aforesaid have derived a share of 1/24+1/72=4/72=1/18 each from and out of the land in suit.

The complaint of the 29th Defendant Appellant therefore does not amount to, not assigning the rights of Punchihamy which she had transferred to the children of Salan Appu but the Learned Trial Judge wrongly, by assigning to the 7 children of Seeman Appu. The Plaintiff in giving evidence had adverted to the aforesaid Deed bearing No.2565 dated 03.05.1886 and marked and produced the said deed at the trial as, 'P25'. However, after the conclusion of the trial, although the said deed was marked in evidence, the same had not been tendered to Court by the Plaintiff for reasons better known to him.

Hence, the said marked document was not before the Learned Trial Judge at the time of entering the judgment. It looks like the initial mistake on the part of the Learned Trial Judge.

Page 4 of 8

The reason was that he had failed to call for the said deed prior to entering the judgment as it was a marked document and a part of the case record.

It was held in Podiralahamy v. Ranbanda 1993 (2) SLR 26, that "there is a duty cast on Court to take the document tendered and marked at the trial to its custody and keep them filed of record. Documents marked in evidence become part of the record".

It was held in Chandraratna Vs Piyasena 1999(3) SLR 201, that; According to section 114 (2) of Civil Procedure Code, every document so proved/admitted shall be endorsed with a number/letter, the Judge shall then make an entry on the record to the effect that such document is proved/admitted, the document should then be filed as part of the record; there

is a duty cast on Court to take the documents tendered and marked to' its custody and keep them filed of record as the documents marked are, become part of the record.

114(3). It is the duty of a Trial Judge to direct all parties after the trial to tender all documents

to Court with a list attached before writing the judgment; he had failed to do so in this

instance.

It is important to mention that according to the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and the long line of judicial precedents it has now become well settled law that once a document

is marked and produced at a trial, the same forms a part of the case record and if the same

had not been tendered to Court, a Trial Judge should call for the same from the party who

had produced the same at the trial.

It is clear that the Learned Trial Judge had failed in his duty to call for the said document, P25 prior to the entering of judgment and since the non-consideration of the contents of the said document by the Learned Trial Judge is erroneous in law. Furthermore, the Learned Judge had arrived at an erroneous conclusion that the deed marked 'P25' was a deed executed in the year 1986. Whereas the said deed was not a deed executed in the year 1986 but a deed executed in the year 1886. He had further misdirected himself in arriving at the erroneous conclusions that since the present action had been instituted in the year 1981, Deed 'P25' had been executed pending this action and as the same had been not produced for his perusal, aforesaid rights of Punchihamy should devolve unto all her children. This conclusion is completely wrong.

Hence, the entire share of said Punchihamy which ought to have devolved on the 1" Defendant through whom the 29th Defendant Appellant derives her title, had been assigned to other parties on the said erroneous conclusion ofthe Learned Trial Judge. He had accepted all the other deeds adduced by the 29th Defendant - Appellant and then had arrived at the conclusion that all the rights of the 1" Defendant (Original Plaintiff) had devolved on to the

29th Defendant but due to the aforesaid misdirection on the part of the Learned Trial Judge the 29th Defendant Appellant had lost a 1/6th share from and out of the land which is a substantial amount of land.

At the time of lodging the instant appeal, the 29th Defendant- Appellant has filed on the 15.12.1997, a copy of the said deed bearing No. 2565 dated 03.05.1886. On perusal of the

said deed, it can be clearly observed that the averments contained in the amended Plaint in relation to the rights of Punchihamy and the predecessors in title of the Appellant are correct and a great injustice had occurred to the 29th Defendant Appellant, due to the said

Page 5 of 8

misdirection on the part of the Learned Trial Judge. The appeal of the 29th Defendant-Appellant relates only to correctness of the calculation of the shares in the said judgment and

challenging only the findings in relation to the miscalculation of shares by the Learned Trial Judge.

Thus, the 29th Defendant Appellant's share, has to be re calculated and should be adjusted accordingly.

Now I wish to consider the arguments of the Substituted-Plaintiff-Respondent (it should be the Plaintiff Appellant) who states that there was no corpus dispute as the corpus to be partitioned was admitted by all parties. It was also admitted that the original owners of the corpus were Athawudage Karonchi Appu, Athawudage Bastian alias Babappu and Athawudage Simon Appu.

The Original Plaintiff contented that one Manis, a grandchild of one of the original owners

Karonchi, gifted his share of the land to his six (06) children, namely, Jinoris alias Jayaneris, Babun Nona, Jane, Mary, John and Abilian, by deed of gift No. 2274 dated 1992.12.22. The

said Manis had 6 children only.

The contention of the 14 (a) Defendant was that, Manis was having a total of 6 brothers and sisters bring the total of 7 children to Manis's father, namely Davith. Names of the Davith's 7 children are; Kirineris, Singnoappu, Pinhamy, Singnohamy, Kechchohamy alias Manchohamy, and Manis. Then he had another child by the name of Nonchihamy. The share of said Nonchihamy had devolved on the 14 (a) Defendant. Therefore, the Original Plaintiff states that the Learned Trial Judge in his judgment dated 1997.10.22 had completely gone wrong, in fact and in law, and had decided that one Davith had 7 children. The Plaintiff states that it appears that the Learned Trial Judge had mi ~takenly considered Manis as Davith, and had arrived at an erroneous finding. But I strongly believe that Learned Trail Judge has decided it correctly. Shares of Davith and his son Manis were calculated by the trail Judge and given properly to their children.

The Learned District Judge, however, has overlooked the fact that the partition action

proceeded on oral as well as on documentary evidence, and had erred in fact by not

considering that the original first Defendant later got in to the shoes of the Plaintiff and

proceeded with the partition Action.

The Learned Trial Judge had mistakenly considered that the present first Defendant namely

Kumbukage Premarathne as the original first DE!fendant. It is worth mentioning that, as at the date of the preliminary plan, the matter had not proceeded to trial and the first Defendant as at the date of the preliminary plan was Don Peter Jayakody (Present Plaintiff.) Therefore, the foundation marked D should go to the present Plaintiff namely, Don Peter Jayakody.

In this connection it is worth re capturing the issue No. 2 raised on behalf of the Plaintiff (Don Peter Jayakody);

"(2) ~8"" B1l~ "10"" 292 "',&8""~ <l25'J B1l6 i;):>l25'J "1Ue>dJ0D 1 u,:>l B""!5l",,~

In his judgment dated 1997.10.23 tho;( Learn.;-d Trial Judge had erroneously observed as follows.

"'to25) 1 <;6~ "'25),()",e:I i)elJJvCl 1 "'V"1 t)d25125)o( e:)W 14 ",v,s'l t)d25125)Ot 'tS 251v,S25) 0,

Z5)tZ)) 1I

It is evident that the Learned Trial Judge had failed to consider the words "~(S25) 80 @,s'l", 'tue:lc),,,,D 1 v", t)d2512&lo( in its proper pen;pective and had erroneously awarded the cultivation of lot 1 and 2 to the present first Defendant (Kumbukage Premarathne), when in fact it is the Plaintiff (Don Peter Jayakody) who had claimed for the said cultivation of lot 1 and 2 as appears at the commission report of the Preliminary Plan dated 11.10.1981.Thus, the erroneous finding cannot stand and this Court has to correct the mistake committed by the Learned Trial Judge and award the cultivation of lot 1 and 2 for its rightful claimant, the

Plaintiff, namely, Don Peter Jayakody who has claimed for it and also had raised an issue in respect of the cultivation.

It was further argued that the Learned Trial Judge had completely gone wrong by depriving the present plaintiff of his rightful entitlement to the foundation marked D in the Preliminary

Plan, for which he has claimed before the surveyor on 11.10.1981. The foundation referred to as "D" in the preliminary plan and referred to as "D" in the preliminary report was claimed by the original first Defendant (Don Peter Jayakody). He had claimed for the foundation which is 25 years old, as at the date of the Preliminary Plan. It is worth considering that the original first Defendant, namely Don Peter Jayakody later got in to shoes of the Plaintiff since the Original Plaintiff (Kumbukage Premarathne) illdicated to Court, his unwillingness to proceed with the action.

The Learned Trial Judge had completely gone wrong by depriving the present Plaintiff of his

rightful entitlement to the foundation for which . he has .claimed for. The present first Defendant (Kumbukage Premarathna) had transferred his rights to the 29th Defendant namely, Athukoralage Kusumawathie Athukorala. However, the original first Defendant (present Plaintiff) had not alienated any of his ri~htful entitlement to the 29th Defendant. Thus, the finding of the Learned Trial Judge, to the effect that, the foundation marked as "D"

be devolved on the 29th Defendant, is erroneous and cannot be stand. It should be corrected and the present Plaintiff is entitled for it and the Plaintiff should be given the said foundation marked D in the Preliminary Plan. The Learned Trial Judge had completely gone wrong by depriving the present Plaintiff of his rightful entitlement to the foundation for which he has

claimed for.

The 13a, 17b and 26a Defendant-Respondents state that the Learned District Judge has carefully analyzed the title that has been accrued to them by evaluating the evidence led before him and Deeds produced in evidence and ordered to partition the said corpus. The 19th B and 12th Defendant Respondemts also accepted the Judgment given in the present District Court case No. 1620/P and have no objection regarding the same.

The findings of the Learned District Judge are.pllrely based on reasons which are emanating from evidence and the Learned Trial Judge has arrived at his findings after a careful evaluation of all evidence placed before him and through investigation of title. It is my opinion that the Learned District Judge has considered all the deeds that have been produced in evidence and

Page 7 of 8

oral evidence led before him. Further he has carefully analyzed all the evidence placed before

him. Therefore, the said Judgment of the Learned District Judge clearly reveals that he has

carefully investigated the title of the subject matter.

However, there has been a " slip or omission" In allotting the shares of the 29'h Defendant

Appellant. Clearly, there has been a mistake of the Trial Judge. Obviously, that slip or omission

was not deliberate. It may be accidental mistake.

I therefore believe that co"siderlng the aforesaid, the distribution of shares should be

amended and be allotted as follows;

1. Plaintiff ( Don Peter Jayakody ) -32623 / 126,000 2. 9'h Defendant 133 / 126,000 3. 12'h Defendant 2833 / 126,000 4. 13'h Defendant ( 30'h Defen.) 23927/126,000 5. 14'h A Defendant 6719 /126,000 6. 17'h A Defendant 1750 / 126,000 7. 18'h Defendant 16587/ 126,000 8. 19'h Defendant 10300/ 126,000 9. 20'h Defendant 10275/126,000 10. 26'h Defendant 6327 / 126,000 11. 29'h Defendant Appellant 12146 / 126,000 12. Unallotted 2380/ 126,000

Subject to the above-mentioned am'Ondments the Judgment of the Learned District

Judge dilted 22.10.1997, is affirnled.

Considering the circumstances, No Order for Cost.

Interlocutory decree may enter, accordingly.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to forward the original case record of P 1620 to

the Registrar of the District Court - Horana, along with a copy of this Judgment, forthwith .
