Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner is an Attorney-at-Law and a Notary Public. The

1st Respondent, the Commissioner of Revenue of the Western

Province, found systematic stamp duty forgeries on a large

number of Deeds executed by the Petitioner. The modus

operandi had been affixing forged stamp duty payment receipts

on the Deeds, thereby defrauding the Commissioner of Lands,

the Commissioner of Revenue and Government revenue.

The Petitioners position is these forgeries were committed

unknown to her by her clerk who pleaded guilty to forgery when

proceedings were instituted against him in the Magistrates

Court. The Petitioner further says this clerk also deceived two

other Attorneys-at-Law who had obtained the services of the

clerk in the course of their notarial practice.

The 1st Respondent by letter marked P5(a) dated 18.11.2015,

informed the Petitioner that the stamp duty payable on Deed No.

1989 executed by the Petitioner had not been credited to the

Commissioners account, and requested the Petitioner to pay the

stamp duty in a sum of Rs. 2,399,000 with a 300% penalty

thereon in a sum of Rs. 7,197,000, amounting to a total sum of

Rs. 9,596,000. The payment was requested within seven days.

The Petitioner immediately paid the stamp duty but did not pay

the penalty.

The Petitioner also received the letter marked P6(a) dated

24.11.2015 from the 1st Respondent, informing her that the

4

stamp duty payable on Deed No. 1953 executed by the Petitioner

had not been credited to the Commissioners account.

Accordingly, the Petitioner was requested to pay the stamp duty

of Rs. 1,319,000 with a 300% penalty thereon in a sum of Rs.

3,957,000, amounting to a sum of Rs. 5,276,000, within seven

days.

The Petitioner again paid only the stamp duty, not the penalty.

The Petitioner then received 11 letters from the 1st Respondent

marked P7(a)-P17(a) all dated 27.11.2015. By these letters the

Petitioner was informed that for Deed Nos. 1992, 1995, 1954,

1958, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1978, 1980 and 1982 executed

by her, stamp duties had not been credited to the account of the

Commissioner of Revenue of the Western Province (although

forged bank payment receipts had been pasted on the duplicate

Deeds). She was requested to pay the said stamp duties with a

300% penalty thereon within seven days. The Petitioner

immediately paid the stamp duties, but not the penalties.

The 1st Respondent sent another six similar letters all dated

02.12.2015 to the Petitioner. They are marked P18(a)-P23(a).

These letters relate to Deed Nos. 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1932

and 1921 executed by the Petitioner.

As she did before, the Petitioner paid the default stamp duties

relevant to the said Deeds but did not pay the penalties thereon.

The 1st Respondent then sent 19 notices in respect of the 19

Deeds mentioned earlier, under section 57(1)(b) of the Financial

Statute of the Western Province, No. 6 of 1990, requiring the

5

Petitioner to pay the stamp duties in default and the penalties

thereon immediately. The said notices have been marked P24-

P42. P24 and P25 are dated 08.12.2015. P26-P42 are dated

31.12.2015.

The Petitioner filed appeals against these section 57(1)(b)

notices, as she is entitled to do under section 79(1) of the

Financial Statute of the Western Province. The appeals are

marked P43(a)-P43(s).

The P43(p) and P43(b) appeals dated 07.01.2016 were filed

against the notices marked P24 and P25 dated 08.12.2015,

respectively.

Against the notices marked P26-P42 all dated 31.12.2015, the

appeals P43(r), P43(q), P43(i), P43(h), P43(a), P43(k), P43(l),

P43(m), P43(n), P43(o), P43(s), P43(d), P43(e), P43(f), P43(g),

P43(j) and P43(c) all dated 04.02.2016 were filed, respectively.

As there was no response from the 1st Respondent to these

appeals, the Petitioner filed another composite appeal dated

14.07.2016 marked P44. In P44, the Petitioner referred to the

previous appeals marked P43(a)-P43(s).

The 1st Respondent did not reply P44 either. Hence the

Petitioner handed over P45 on 22.02.2017, reminding the 1st

Respondent of the appeals filed and also requesting that an

inquiry be held to prove her innocence.

No inquiry was held on these appeals. Instead the 1st

Respondent filed cases in the Magistrates Court to recover the

penalties as fines.

6

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash P5(a)-

P23(a) letters and P24-P42 section 57(1)(b) notices by a writ of

certiorari; to prevent the Respondents from taking any legal

action to recover the said penalties by a writ of prohibition; and

to direct the 1st Respondent to consider P43(a)-P43(s) and P44 as

proper appeals and to hold an inquiry into the matters reflected

in P3(a), P6, P7(a), P8, P9, P11, P13 by mandamus.

The gravamen of the submission of learned Presidents Counsel

for the Petitioner is that in violation of the rules of natural

justice, the Petitioner was not heard on her appeals marked

P43(a)-P43(s) and P44 prior to the 1st Respondent taking steps to

recover the penalties imposed by instituting actions in the

Magistrates Court.

Let me now consider this submission.

Section 57(1)(b) of the Financial Statute of the Western Province

states:

if he [the Commissioner] is of opinion that such instrument

is chargeable with stamp duty and is not duly stamped, he

shall, by notice in writing, require the person liable to pay

the stamp duty to pay the proper duty or the amount

required to make up the same, together with a penalty not

exceeding three times the amount of the proper duty.

This section allows the Commissioner to impose a penalty equal

to three times the stamp duty payable, in addition to the stamp

duty in default.

7

Hence, I hold the P24-P42 notices sent under section 57(1)(b) of

the Financial Statute contain lawful decisions. These notices

cannot be quashed by certiorari.

Section 79(1) of the Financial Statute states any person

aggrieved by the decision made under section 57(1)(b) may

appeal against it to the 1st Respondent Commissioner within

thirty days after the service of notice.

By the appeals marked P43(p) and P43(b) dated 07.01.2016, the

Petitioner appealed against the P24 and P25 notices dated

08.12.2015, issued under section 57(1)(b) of the Financial

Statute.

In the appeal P43(p), the Petitioner, whilst attaching a photocopy

of the envelope which contained the notice, specifically stated it

had been posted on 10.12.2015.

In the appeal P43(b), the Petitioner, whilst attaching a photocopy

of the envelope which contained the notice, specifically stated it

had been posted on 12.12.2015.

This has not been denied by the 1st Respondent immediately

thereafter or in the statement of objections filed before this

Court.

I consider both appeals as having been filed within time and

therefore P43(p) and P43(b) constitute valid appeals.

The other appeals marked P43(a), P43(c)-(o), P43(q)-(s) all dated

04.02.2016 were filed against the notices marked P26-P42 dated

8

31.12.2015, issued under section 57(1)(b) of the Financial

Statute.

Although it appears these appeals have been filed out of time,

the Petitioner in the said appeals, whilst attaching a photocopy

of the envelope containing the notices, clearly stated the said

notices had been posted on 07.01.2016, thereby intimating she

had received the notices on a date subsequent to the date of

posting.

This position has not been denied by the 1st Respondent either

immediately thereafter or in the statement of objections filed

before this Court.

The said appeals are dated 04.02.2016 and have therefore been

filed within the appealable period.

According to section 79(1), appeals shall be filed within thirty

days not from the date of notice but after the service of notice.

I consider the appeals marked P43(a)-P43(s) to be valid appeals.

The Petitioner wishes P44 also to be regarded as a valid appeal.

However, P44 cannot be regarded as a valid appeal as it has

been filed out of time. But this does not make any difference.

P44 is redundant, as the Petitioner had already tendered valid

appeals by P43(a)-P43(s).

According to section 79(6) of the Financial Statute, unless there

is an adjustment, the Commissioner shall fix a time and place

for the hearing of the appeal made against a notice under

section 57(1)(b), and a proper inquiry shall be held. A detailed

9

procedure is laid down in section 79 running into

subparagraphs (1)-(13) regarding the conduct of such an appeal.

An aggrieved party can appeal against the decision of the

Commissioner to the Board of Review and then to the Court of

Appeal. The procedure is exhaustively set out in chapters XXV

and XXVI of the Financial Statute.

There cannot be any dispute that no inquiry contemplated by

section 79 was held by the 1st Respondent in respect of the

appeals marked P43(a)-P43(s).

Without a hearing and decision on these appeals, the 1st

Respondent could not have instituted proceedings in the

Magistrates Court to recover the penalties.

For the aforesaid reasons I quash all the Magistrates Court

proceedings initiated by the 1st Respondent to recover the

penalties as reflected in the notices marked P24-P42 by

certiorari, and direct the 1st Respondent by mandamus to hold

an inquiry in respect of the appeals filed by the Petitioner in

P43(a)-P43(s) and make an appropriate Order in terms of the

law.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed. Let the parties bear

their own costs.
