Chathurangani Mahawaduge, SC for the Attorney- General.

20th of February, 2020

HON. JUSTICE ACHALA WENGAPPULI

In this application the 5th Suspect- Petitioner was produced before the Magistrate's

Court of Anamaduwa under case No. BR 568/ 2010/ A / NS and was enlarged on Bail.

One of the bail conditions that were imposed by the High Court in enlarging him on bail,

because allegation was one of murder, that he reports to Nochchiyagama Police Station

between 9.00 am to 12.00 noon on every Sunday .

He had furnished the bail conditions but after sometime it was reported that he had

violated the said condition by not reporting to police as per the bail conditions for well

over 06 months period. He was charged for violating bail conditions before the

Nochchiyagama Magistrate's Court under case No. 62476 and having pleaded guilty, he

was fined.

2

In addition to that, the High Court of Puttalam, in its bail application No.24/ 2016, an

order was made to remand him for violation of bail conditions and a subsequent

application by the 5th Suspect- Petitioner to vary and to enlarge him on bail was denied.

learned State Counsel having filed objections resisting the application by the

5th Suspect- Petitioner before this Court to revise the said Order of the High Court

indicated to Court that although the Honorable Attorney General supports the order of

the learned High Court Judge in refusing bail, if the 5th Suspect- Petitioner gives an

undertaking that he would abide by the said condition of reporting to Nochchiyagama

Police Station on every Sunday between 9.00am to 12.00 noon, he would not resist the

application.

learned Counsel for the Petitioner informs Court that the 5th Suspect- Petitioner

undertakes to comply with the said bail conditions hereafter.

This Court therefore varies the order of the High Court dated 01.10.2019. It is varied

enabling the 5th Suspect- Petitioner to be enlarged on Bailon the conditions already

imposed by the High Court, in addition to the one mentioned above.

learned State Counsel also undertakes to expedite the pending non summary inquiry

stili not reached its finality although 10 years had gone by.

Subject to the above variation of the bail order, the Petition of the 5th Suspect-

Petitioner is dismissed.

3

Certified copy of today's Order be made available to the learned counsel for the

Petitioner upon payment of usual charges.

Registrar of this Court is directed to issue certified copies of the order of the Court to

the relevant High Court, Magistrate's Court and Officer-in- Charge of Nochchiyagama

Police Station.

learned Counsel for the Petitioner requests that the Order of the Court is

communicated to the relevant parties by fax and he would bear the applicable costs in

this special procedure.

HON. JUSTICE DEVIKA ABEYRATNE

I agree.
