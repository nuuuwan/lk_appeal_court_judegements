01. lSI, 2nd, 3rd Accused Appellants (Appellants) with 4th Accused were indicted in the High

Court of Badulla with one count of murder punishable under section 296 to be read with

section 32 of the Penal Code. After trial the learned High Court Judge convicted the

Appellants as charged and sentenced them to death. 4th Accused was convicted for a lesser

offence punishable under section 314 of the Penal Code. Being aggrieved by the said

conviction, the Appellants preferred the instant appeal. Grounds of appeal urged by the

Appellants in their written submissions and settled at the argument stage are;

1 SI Appellant

1. Prosecution has failed to prove the charge against the 1 st Appellant beyond

reasonable doubt.

I. There appears a conflict of evidence between PW3 namely Rasika and

PWS namely Chandima with regard to the onset of the 2nd incident.

2. Evidence led at the trial necessarily negates common murderous intention

on the part of A2 and A3.

3. Imputation of vicarious liability on A2 and A3 IS legally and factually

flawed.

4. Evidence led at the trial warrants a conviction against A2 and A3 on

individual liability and not on common murderous intention.

S. Learned Trial Judge failed to address his judicial mind to the items of

evidence favourable to A2 and A3 which would have played a pivotal role

in deciding culpability.

02. Facts in brief are as follows. The deceased was a police officer. His wife was a school

teacher and the deceased and the wife were living in the teacher's quarters inside the

school premises. Two incidents had taken place on the day of the alleged incident.

According to the testimony of the eye witness PW3, she was a student of the school where

the wife of the deceased was a teacher. Although it was during school vacation, she had

gone for band practices in the morning. According to her, 2nd and 3'd Appellants had gone

to the quarters that the deceased was living and had tapped on the door. Deceased had

opened the door. Then she had seen them fighting, and the deceased had gone inside the

house. Then the 2nd and the 3'd Appellants had gone towards the road. That was the I"

incident.

03. Thereafter, the deceased had come out of the house, dressed in his police uniform and had

gone towards the road. Then the 2nd and 3'd Appellants and the 4th Accused carrying poles

(C!tc'~S~J ~) had come towards the deceased and had assaulted the deceased. She said

that the albesia poles were taken from the fence. Deceased had fallen on the ground.

Children who had come for band practices including Chandima had been there. One of the

Appellants had trampled the deceased's legs and another had trampled the hands. Witness

and the other children had shouted not to assault, not to kill. Then one of the assailants had

shouted, '(;([)() ~df5) ~(JJ @fiJ/@fiJGJt:i! (f)(jJf5)D./ (page 86). Then due to the fear, they had

not gone closer. When they were leaving the place, Chandima (PWS) had been standing

close to the incident. Chandima had told her that the I st Appellant stabbed the deceased.

04. PWS Chandima has testified corroborating the version of PW2 on the 2nd incident took

place near the road. She had seen the 2nd and the 3rd Appellants assaulting the deceased

with albesia poles. Deceased had been in uniform unarmed. When the deceased fell down,

the I st Appellant had come with a knife and had stabbed the deceased. PWS had been

about 7 feet away from the incident. 2nd and the 3rd Appellants had been holding the

deceased from his legs and the hands when the deceased was stabbed by the I st Appellant.

PWS had given clear and consistent evidence about the incident.

os. Learned President's Counsel for the 1 st Appellant submitted that the evidence of PWS

Chandima on stabbing the deceased was contradictory to what she had said in her

statement to the police. Counsel referred to the contradiction marked as VI. Learned

President's Counsel further submitted that the 1 st Appellant is now disabled and to

consider lesser culpability in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code, in the circumstances.

06. In her evidence at the trial, PWS said that she saw the I st Appellant stabbing the deceased.

However, she had not told the police that she saw the Accused stabbing (contradiction

marked as V 1 at page 2S9 of the brief).

07. At this stage, it is also important to note that the 1 st Appellant in his allocution in terms of

section 280 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, admitted stabbing the deceased.

Appellate Court is entitled to take into consideration what the Appellant said in his

allocution. An admission made by an Accused person in answer to the allocution in terms

of the Criminal Procedure Code is part of the evidence in the case, and the Court of

Criminal Appeal cannot ignore the effect of such admission (Periambalam v. The Qlleell

74 NLR 515).

08. In his allocution the 1 sl Appellant said that he had a scuffle with the deceased. When the

deceased tried to stab him, when he tried to prevent, the deceased got stabbed, he said.

Further, he said that acted in self-defence.

09. At the trial this position was never taken by the defence. It was not even suggested to the

witnesses. The learned Trial Judge has considered all the evidence adduced at the trial,

analyzed the same and rightly decided that the 1 sl Appellant stabbed the deceased that

caused his death. There was no evidence of the 1 sl Appellant using his right of self-

defence, at the trial. Hence, the sole ground of appeal urged by the 1 st Appellant has no

merit.

10. First ground of appeal urged by the 2nd and the 3 rd Appellants is that the evidence of PW3

and PW5 with regard to the onset of the 2nd incident appears to be conflicting. The

evidence of both witnesses was adequately considered and analyzed by the learned Trial

Judge.

11. In case of State of Uttar Pradesh V. M .K. AnthollY (AIR [1985[ SC 48, [1985/ Cri. L. J.

493 it was held;

'While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of

truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the

Court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the

deficiencies, draw-backs and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole

and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the

evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the

evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief Minor discrepancies or

trivial mailers not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by

taking sentences torn pot of context here or there from the evidence, aI/aching

importance to some technical error committed by the investigating officer not

going to the root of the mailer would not ordinarily permit rejection of the

evidence as a whole. '

12. It is also important to note that a witness cannot be expected to narrate a story as if

replaying a video recording. It is humanly impossible to remember every minute detail of

an incident.

13. There is no conflict between the evidence of the PW3 and PW5 that would affect their

credibility. They are independent witnesses who saw the incident when they were in

school. Ground of appeal No.1 preferred by the 2nd and 3rd Appellants should necessarily

fail.

14. Grounds of appeal 2 to 5 of the 2nd and 3rd Appellants will be discussed together. Learned

counsel for the 2nd Appellant submitted that according to the evidence of the two eye

witnesses, 2nd, 3rd Appellants and the 41h Accused had assaulted the deceased with albesia

sticks. The 1st Appellant had come from nowhere and had stabbed the deceased. 2nd and 3rd

Appellants therefore never shared a murderous intention with the 151 Appellant. Counsel

further submitted that although there was no sudden fight, there was no murderous

intention with the 2nd and 3rd Appellants. Hence, the evidence against the 2nd and 3rd

Appellants was for lesser culpability of an offence under section 297 of the Penal Code on

the basis of knowledge, counsel submitted.

15. Learned counsel for the 3rd Appellant associated with the submissions made by the counsel

for the 2nd Appellant, other than to add that the 2nd and 3rd Appellants were unarmed when

they came at the 2nd incident. Therefore, no murderous intention can be attributed to them.

16. It was the contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent that it

was a premeditated murder committed by all three Appellants. Assault and the stabbing

that occurred during the 2nd incident calIDot be separated. Evidence of the eye witnesses

was consistent and they testified without any contradiction per se or inter se other than V I,

counsel submitted.

17. In case of Saratll Kllmara V. Attorney General (CA 20712008) on 04.04 2014 Court said;

' ... Once a participatory presence in furtherance of a common

intention is established at the commencement of an incident, there is no

6

requirement that both perpetrators should be physically present at the

culmination of the event unless it could be shown by some overt act that one

perpetrator deliberately withdrew from the situation to disengage and detach

himselffrom vicarious liability .... '

18. In case of Qlleen V. Mahathllll 61 NLR 540, Court of Criminal appeal held;

To establish the existence of a common intention it is not essential to

prove that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to a pre-arranged

plan. A common intention can come into existence wit haUl pre-arrangement. [t

can beformed on the 5pur of the moment. '

19. In the instant case it was clearly evident that 2nd and 3'd Appellants came to the house of

the deceased and started a fight. That was the 151 incident. Thereafter, when the deceased

went on to the road in his police unifonn, the 2nd, 3'd Appellants and 4th Accused had come

and assaulted the deceased. Evidence of PW3 was that 2nd and 3'd Appellants assaulted the

deceased with albesia poles. 4th Accused had given the poles to the 2nd and 3'd Appellants

(page 268 and 269 of the brief). Then the 151 Appellant had come and stabbed the deceased

who was fallen. Accused persons also had threatened her not to give evidence. She could

not remember which Accused threatened her. It is clear from the evidence that the

deceased fell when the 2nd and 3'd Appellants assaulted him. 2nd and 3'd Appellants neither

withdrew from the scene, nor prevented the 151 Appellant from stabbing the deceased. The

evidence therefore clearly shows that the Appellants shared the common murderous

intention at the time the deceased was assaulted and stabbed. Although there was only one

stab injury, it was to the chest piercing the lung and the heart causing death. Therefore, the

intention is clear that it was to kill the deceased when that injury was caused. There were

10 more injuries observed by the Medical Officer who conducted the autopsy on the body

of the deceased. There were abrasions and contusions, may have caused by the assault as

evident.

20. As contended by the learned DSG for the Respondent, on the clear evidence adduced, the

2nd incident of the assault on the deceased by the 2nd and 3'd Appellants cannot be

separated from the stabbing by the 151 Appellant. The evidence suggests that the 4th

Accused also shared the same common intention. However, the learned High Court Judge

7

found him guilty for a lesser offence, not murder, and State has not preferred an appeal

against the said decision of the learned High Court Judge.

21. No evidence of lesser culpability can be derived from the evidence adduced, on the basis

of knowledge or sudden fight as suggested by the counsel for the Appellants.

22. Learned High Court Judge has carefully analyzed all the evidence adduced at the trial and

has come to the correct conclusion that the prosecution has proved the charge of murder

against the I", 2nd and 3'd Appellants beyond reasonable doubt. In the above premise, I

find that all grounds of appeal should fail and the conviction of the Appellants by the

learned High Court Judge should be affirmed.

Appeal is dismissed.

K.K. WICKREMASINGHE, J
