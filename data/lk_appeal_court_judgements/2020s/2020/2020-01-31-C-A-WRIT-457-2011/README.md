Before: Janak De Silva J.

N. Bandula Karunarathna J.

Counsel:

S.A. Parthalingam P.c. with Shammil Perera P.c., Sandun Nagahawatte and Sanasi

Dissanayake for the Petitioner

Sobhitha Rajakaruna SDSG for 1't to 3rd and 6th Respondents

Harith De Mel with Piyumi Kumari for 4th Respondent

Argued on: 07.05.2019

Written Submissions tendered on:

Petitioner on 21,06.2019

4th Respondents on 25.06.2019

Decided on: 31.01.2020

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the directive/order of the 1st

Respondent dated 20.10.2010 (P18). It is a final notice before legal action is taken

to recover a sum of Rs. 9680869.79 from the Petitioner as Employees Provident

Fund (EPF) dues.

The Petitioner denies that any such sum is due and claims that it did not employ

the persons whose EPF dues are sought to be recovered by P18.

Parties have tendered extensive written submissions on the question of whether

the Petitioner was the employer of the persons whose EPF amounts are due.

However, this matter can be disposed on two fundamental matters namely

whether the application is futile and whether all necessary parties have been made

Respondents to this application.

Firstly, the learned counsel for the 4th Respondent submitted that the application is

futile in that P18 is only a final notice before legal action is instituted to recover the

outstanding EPF dues whereas the real decision is PiS against which the Petitioner

has not sought any relief.

I have no hesitation in upholding this position. It is by PiS dated 16.06.2010 that

the Petitioner was informed of the decision that a sum of Rs. 9680869.79 is

outstanding as EPF dues for 94 persons whose names and details are set out in a

list annexed to PiS of which the 4th and 5th Respondents are all but two persons.

Therefore, a writ of certiorari will not be issued to quash P18 as firstly, it is not a

decision which determined whether the EPF dues are payable by the Petitioner and

secondly even if a writ of certiorari is issued as prayed for in the petition, it is a

futile exercise since PiS will continue to exist.

It is an established principle that administrative law remedies will be refused if it is

futile [Peiris v. Gunasekera (66 NLR 498); Shamsudeen v. The Minister of Defence

and External Affairs (63 NLR 430)]. In Air Vice Marshall Elmo Perera vs. Liyanage

and others [(2003) 1 Sri.L.R. 331] it was held that writ would not lie if the final relief

sought is a futile remedy. Similarly, in Flying Officer Ratnayake vs. Commander of

the Air Force and Others [(2008) 2 Sri.L.R. 162] this Court refused to issue a writ of

mandamus directing the holding of a court martial as H.E. the President had already

approved the withdrawal of the commission. Accordingly, the relief claimed by the

Petitioner in the form of a writ of certiorari to quash P18 is futile.

In this context it is noted that the Petitioner has not sought to quash the decision

marked PiS. In Weerasooriya v. The Chairman, National Housing Development

Authority and Others [CA. Application No. 866/98, CAM. 08.03.2004] Sripavan J.

(as he was then) held that the court will not set aside a document unless it is

specifically-pleaded and identified in express language in the prayer to the petition.

The learned counsel for the 4th Respondent further submitted that in any event a

writ of certiorari will not lie as the Petitioner has failed to make all necessary parties

Respondents to this application.

The rule is that all those who would be affected by the outcome of the writ

application should be made respondents to the application [Amaratunga J. in

Wijeratne (Commissioner of Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Paragoda Wimalawansa

Thera and 4 others [(2011) 2 SrLL.R. 258 at 267).

While this is the general rule a particular application of this rule in relation to school

admission is found in Gregory Fernando and Others v. Stanley Perera, Acting

Principal, Christ The King National School and Others [(2004) 1 SrLL.R. 346) where

this Court dismissed in limine an application which sought a writ of certiorari to

quash the temporary list of successful candidates without making the successful

children parties to the application.

The application of the Petitioner for a mandate in the nature of writ of certiorari to

quash P18 must be dismissed in limine for the failure to add as Respondents all the

beneficiaries of the order marked PiS.

The learned counsel for the 4th Respondent finally submitted that heavy costs

should be ordered against the Petitioner.

Notice in this application was issued on 13.07.2011 on which day this Court held :

"On perusal of the documents marked P18, Court observes that the

Petitioner was informed by an initial notice marked PiS dated 16.06.2010 to

pay the respective dues and after the Petitioner was given a hearing the

Commissioner of Labour has informed the Petitioner to pay the sum stated

in the said document marked P18 dated 20.10.2010. The Petitioner has not

challenged the said order in any forum and the Petitioner has filed this

application only after the Commissioner of Labour has instituted action in the

Magistrate's Court of Warakapola under case No. 63254."

The futility of this application was apparent even at the time of its institution and it

has resulted in delaying action being proceeded with to recover the EPF dues.

Hence, I am of the view that an order for high costs is appropriate in the

circumstances of the case.

For all the foregoing reasons, this application is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.

1,00,000/=.

N. Bandula Karunarathna J.

I agree.
