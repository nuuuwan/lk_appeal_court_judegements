Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The issue that arises for the determination of this Court is whether the 2nd

Respondent acted reasonably and in terms of the law when he formed his

opinion that the land which is the subject matter of the quit notice served on

the Petitioners in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7

of 1979, is State land.

Material facts

The Petitioners state that the 1st Petitioner is the owner of an allotment of land

bearing assessment No. 107, Nuwara Eliya Road, Welimada, situated in the

Welimada Town. The Petitioners state that the said land formed part of a

larger land called Uda Demodara, in extent of 1A 1R which had been owned

by K. Don Peter Perera. The said K. Don Peter Perera had transferred the said

land to K. Don Wilmot Perera by Deed of Gift bearing No. 51447 dated 8th

September 1965. Although a copy of the said Deed has not been produced, an

extract of the Register maintained by the Land Registrar has been annexed to

the petition marked P4A.

3

This Court has examined P4A and observes the following:

(a) The property gifted by the said Deed is inclusive of the land leased for a

Petrol Shed;

(b) The extent of the land has been given as 5 pelas paddy, being the

equivalent of 1A 1R;

(c) The land has been referred to as Udu Demodara, Kambikanuwa Kumbura,

and Reraawa Kumbura;

(d) Even though the Northern, Eastern and the Western boundaries have

been specified, there is no reference to the survey plan depicting the said

land.

The Petitioners state that K. Don Wilmot Perera had transferred an extent of

3.63P of the above land to Karunasiri Serasinghe by Deed of Transfer No. 3666

dated 21st October 1979, annexed to the petition marked P1. The Petitioners

state further that Karunasiri Serasinghe had undisturbed and uninterrupted

possession of another portion of land out of the aforementioned larger land

Uda Demodara, in extent of 1.47P, which he had transferred to Dayawathie

Serasinghe by Deed of Transfer No. 40504 dated 4th May 2005, annexed to the

petition marked P3.

Soon after the execution of P3, Karunasiri and Dayawathie Serasinghe have

transferred the aforementioned lands in extent of 3.63P and 1.47P, to the 1st

Petitioner, by Deed of Transfer No. 3476 dated 19th June 2005, annexed to the

petition marked P4. The Petitioners state that having obtained approval of

4

the local authority, they constructed a five storey building on the said land.

This Court must observe that even though P3 refers to Plan No. 346 dated 4th

March 1982, and the Non-vesting certificate P5D refers to Plan No. 3476

dated 14th September 2005, copies of such Plans have not been produced to

this Court.

The Petitioners admit that a fuel service station owned by the 1st Respondent,

and operated by the Welimada Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society is situated

on the Northern boundary of their land. The Petitioners have stated further

that the said service station has been in existence for a long period of time and

that there is a boundary wall constructed in 1980 demarcating the boundary

between the 1st Petitioners land and the service station, and that the said

boundary wall was in existence at the time the 1st Petitioner purchased the

said land in 2005. The Petitioners have produced marked CA2, and CA3

respectively, the affidavits of Gunapala De Silva and Nimal Gamini Perera to

confirm the existence of an embankment (.,a neusu) running alongside the

boundary up to the main road. This Court must observe that Gunapala De Silva

owns a property which is situated on the Eastern boundary of the Service

Station and the Petitioners land, with, the 1st Respondent alleging that

Gunapala De Silva has encroached 6.37P of the land owned by the 1st

Respondent.1

The Petitioners state that the 2nd Petitioner received a letter dated 15th August

2014, annexed to the petition marked P7 from the Chief Legal Officer of the

1st Respondent, informing that he has encroached on an extent of 3.6P of land

belonging to the 1st Respondent, and therefore to vacate the said premises in

1 Vide Plan No. 4592 marked P8A.

5

30 days. The 2nd Petitioner states that pursuant to representations made to the

Chief Legal Officer, the 1st Respondent did not pursue the said matter

thereafter.

In August 2018, the 2nd Respondent, an Assistant Manager at the 1st

Respondent, had issued the 1st Petitioner a notice in terms of Section 3(1)(b) of

the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, as amended, (the

Act) directing the Petitioners to deliver vacant possession of the said land on or

before 2nd October 2018.

Aggrieved by the issuance of the said notice, annexed to the petition marked

P8, the Petitioners filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to issue the said quit notice;

b) A Writ of Prohibition restraining the Respondents from taking steps under

the Act.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners submitted two principle

arguments. The first argument was that the land occupied by the Petitioners is

private land and not State land, and for that reason, the issuance of the Notice

P8 is ultra vires the powers of the Respondents. The second argument was

that the land claimed by the Respondents is different to the land claimed by

the Petitioners, in that the name of the land claimed by the Petitioners is

different to the land claimed by the 1st Respondent, and that in any event, the

1st Respondent continues to have the extent of land that it is supposed to own.

6

Procedure to evict a person in unauthorised occupation of State Land

The objective of the Act is the expeditious recovery of State land from persons

who are in unauthorised possession or occupation of such State land.2 Section

3(1) of the Act requires the Competent Authority to form an opinion that the

land in respect of which he is going to put in motion the procedure laid down

in the Act, is State land or in other words, land to which the State is lawfully

entitled3 and that the possession or occupation of the person against whom

the process is to be set in motion, is unauthorised. This is the starting point of

the entire process that is initiated under the Act to evict a person who is in

unauthorized occupation of State land.

The jurisdiction of this Court to consider whether the above opinion formed by

the Competent Authority is ultra vires, illegal, unreasonable or irrational has

not been circumscribed by the provisions of the Act, unlike the limited

remedies available under Section 9 to a person against whom action has been

instituted in the Magistrates Court for ejectment.4

In arriving at his opinion that the impugned land is State land, the Competent

Authority is not required in terms of the Act to carry out an inquiry of the title

of the person who is in unauthorized possession of such land. This position has

2 Section 18 of the Act has defined State land to mean land to which the State is lawfully entitled or which may be disposed of by the State together with any building standing thereon, and with all rights, interests and privileges attached or appertaining thereto, and includes land vested in or owned by or under the control of the 1st Respondent. 3 Vide Section 3(1)(a). 4 Section 9 of the Act reads as follows: (1) At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has been served shall not be entitled to contest any matters stated in the application under section 5 except that such person may establish that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid.; (2) It shall not be competent to the Magistrates Court to call for any evidence from the competent authority in support of the application under section 5.

been clearly laid down in Farook v. Gunewardena, Government Agent,

Ampara5 where it was held as follows:

Where the structure of the entire Act is to preclude investigations and

inquiries and where it is expressly provided (a) the only defence that can

be put forward at any stage of the proceedings under this Act can be

based only upon a valid permit or written authority of the State and (b)

special provisions have been made for aggrieved parties to obtain relief, I

am of the opinion that the Act expressly precludes the need for an inquiry

by the competent authority before he forms the opinion that any land is

State land.

The fact that the Competent Authority is not required to carry out an

investigation of the title of the person in unauthorised possession of such land

is fortified by the provisions of Section 12 of the Act, which provides a

mechanism for a person against whom an order for ejectment has been made

to vindicate his title.6 In fact, in addition to vindicating title and thereby

regaining possession of the land, in terms of Section 13 of the Act, a person

could also obtain compensation for any damages sustained by being compelled

to deliver up possession.

However, it is the view of this Court that the legislature could not have

intended for the Competent Authoritys opinion, which can have far reaching

5 [1980] 2 Sri L.R. 243. 6 Section 12 reads as follows: Nothing in this Act contained shall preclude any person who has been ejected from a land under the provisions of this Act or any person claiming to be the owner thereof from instituting an action against the State for the vindication of his title thereto within six months from the date of the order of ejectment. See Jayawardana Mudiyanselage Sumanawathie vs. Hon. Attorney General and Others [CA 994/2000(F); CA Minutes of 5th September 2019] for an analysis of the remedies available to a person against whom an order for ejectment has been issued.

8

consequences on ones proprietary rights, to be baseless. The Competent

Authoritys opinion must therefore be formed on a rational basis. What

constitutes a rational basis would depend on the facts and circumstances of

each case.

Therefore, when considering the legality and /or the reasonableness of the

opinion of the Competent Authority in the course of an application filed under

Article 140 of the Constitution, this Court will require the Competent Authority

to present the material on which he formed the opinion that the State is

lawfully entitled to the said land, so that this Court can consider whether the

Competent Authority has acted legally and/or reasonably. This Court must

state that in doing so, it is not the function of this Court to consider the title of

the State, or for that matter the title of the person sought to be ejected, to the

said land. That is the function of the District Court under Section 12 of the Act

or in an Actio Res Vindicatio. This Court wishes to state however that merely

because a person who is to be ejected or against whom an order for ejectment

has been made, has a remedy by way of Section 12, does not absolve the

Competent Authority from his obligation to act reasonably and legally, when

forming the all important opinion in terms of Section 3.

The principle then is that while no investigation or inquiry is needed to form

the opinion that the State is lawfully entitled to the land, such opinion must

satisfy the Wednesbury test of reasonableness. What then is the reasonable

basis on which the 2nd Respondent formed the opinion that the 1st Respondent

is lawfully entitled to the land referred to in the notice marked P8?

9

Material on which the opinion of the 2nd Respondent has been formed

The Petitioners have produced marked P9, Town Survey Plan No. 38 prepared

in April 1937. According to the Tenement List attached thereto marked P9A,

Lot Nos. 104 108 which are contiguous lots, are claimed by K. Don Peter

Perera. P9A goes on to mention that Lot No. 106 in extent of 3.71P and Lot

No. 107 in extent of 8.43P have been leased to the Shell Company Ceylon

Limited (Shell Company) and that the Welimada Petrol Depot is situated on Lot

No. 107. Thus, the total extent of land leased to Shell Company as at 1937 was

12.14P.

The Respondents state that K. Don Peter Perera executed Indenture of Lease

No. 21092/491 dated 15th December 1959 in favour of Shell Company. This

Court has examined the said Indenture marked R1A, and observes the

following:

(a) By an Indenture of Lease No. 15539/458 dated 29th July 1952, K. Don

Peter Perera had leased to Shell Company, Lots 1 3 of Plan No. 4/1952

for a period of ten years;

(b) The Third Schedule contains the following description of the land:

All that allotment of land called Ethulhirekumbura situated at Welimada

Town aforesaid and bounded on the North by Bank and ridge, South by

Path, East by Channel and ridge and West by Main Road, containing in

extent one acre one rood and nine perches (A1 R1 P9) according to the

aforesaid Plan No. 91 and which said Ethulhirekumbura and premises are

described in the Title deeds thereof as follows:

10

All that field called Uda Demodara situated at Agampodigama in

Udapalata in the Udakinda Division B Badulla District Province of Uva and

bounded on the North by the field belonging to Kahawekorallage Don

Peter Perera and barbed wire fencing separating the land belonging to the

Government Medical Department, East by the Ima niyara of the field

belonging to Kahawekorallage Don Peter Perera, on the South by Ela and

on the West by High Road containing in extent two pelas of paddy

sowing.

(c) Indenture of Lease No. 15539/458 has been cancelled prematurely by

R1A and the parties have entered into a fresh lease for a period of ten

years commencing 1st August 1959, as evidenced by R1A, in respect of

the following land:

All those three continuous allotments of land depicted as Lots 1, 2 and 3

in the Plan hereinafter referred to of the land called Ethulhirekumbura

bearing assessment No. 105 situated at Welimada within the Town

Council limits of Welimada in Uda Palata Korale in the Uda Kinda division

in the District of Badulla in the Province of Uva and bounded on the North

East and South by the remaining portion of Ethulhirekumbura claimed by

K. Don Peter Perera and on the West by Main Road leading from Nuwara

Eliya to Badulla containing in extent Thirty Two decimal eight eight

perches (A0 R0 32.88P) according to Plan No. 347 dated 25th August 1957

made by W.M.Perera, Licensed Surveyor and Leveller, which said three

allotments of land are divided and refined portions of the land in the Third

Schedule hereto fully described.

11

Thus, by December 1959, K. Don Peter Perera had leased an extent of 32.88

perches to the Shell Company of a land known as Ethulhirekumbura or Uda

Demodara.

It is not in dispute that all filling and service stations owned or leased by Shell

Company were vested in the 1st Respondent that was established by the

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act No. 28 of 1961 (the CPC Act). By an Order

dated 15th January 19647 made in terms of Section 35(1) of the CPC Act, which

has been annexed to the petition marked P10,8 the Minister of Commerce

and Industries had vested in the 1st Respondent the properties referred to in

the Schedule to such Order including the following land:

All those three contiguous allotments of land depicted as Lots 1, 2 and 3

in Plan No. 347 dated 25th August 1957 made by W.M.Perera, Licensed

Surveyor, bearing assessment No. 105, Nuwara Eliya Road, situated at

Welimada within the Town Council limits of Welimada, Badulla District,

Uva Province, bounded on the North, East and South by the remaining

portion of Ethulhirekumbura claimed by K.D.Peter Perera and West by

main road from Nuwara Eliya to Badulla and containing in extent Nil Acres

Nil Roods Thirty Two decimal eight eight perches (0 A 0 R 32.88P)

In terms of Section 35(3) of the CPC Act, A vesting Order shall have the effect

of giving the Corporation absolute title to any property specified in the Order

with effect from the date specified therein and free from all encumbrances.

7 Order has been published in Gazette No. 13923 dated 15th January 1964. 8 Section 35(1) of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation Act reads as follows: The Minister may, by Order (hereafter in this Act referred to as a "vesting Order") published in the Gazette, vest in the Corporation, with effect from such date as shall be specified in the Order, any such notified property ....

12

Part IV of the CPC Act contains provisions relating to the payment of

compensation to the owner of the land where Shell Company was not the

owner. The Respondents have claimed that compensation has in fact been

paid to K. Don Wilmot Perera in 1984, and has produced marked R1 the

award. This Court has examined the said award and observes the following:

He said that the property vested belonged to his father Kahawekorallage

Don Peter Perera who leased it for 10 years to the Shell Company by

Indenture of Lease No. 21092/491 attested by Julius and Creasy, N.P.,

dated 15th December 1959. He produced the lease bond marked C1.

The property is described in the First Schedule in the lease bond; before

the full period of the lease lapsed, the property was vested in the

Petroleum Corporation. His father died in 1975. Before his death, his

father gifted this property which formed a larger land bearing assessment

No. 30 and called and known as Uda Demodara Kumbura alias

Kambikanuwa Kumbura alias Rereawa Kumbura in extent of 1A 1R 0P. The

deed was produced marked C2. He produced the Plan No. 347 dated 25th

August 1957 made by W.P.Perera. Licensed Surveyor, which has been

referred to in Indenture of Lease No. 21092/491 above referred to marked

C3.

He further stated that this property had also been known as Ethulhire

Kumbura.

Therefore, with the Vesting Order P10, the 1st Respondent became the owner

of the aforementioned 32.88P of land that K. Don. Peter Perera had leased to

the Shell Company by R1A.

13

There can be no doubt that the origin of the lands claimed by the Petitioners

and the Respondents emanate from the same source, namely the 1A 1R

property owned by K. Don Peter Perera. The photographs that have been

produced by the 2nd Petitioner with his Counter Affidavit, marked CA1 clearly

establish that the land claimed by the Petitioners and the land on which the

Service Station is situated are adjoining lands, and that the Northern boundary

of the Petitioners land is the Service Station or in other words, the Southern

boundary of the Service Station is the land claimed by the Petitioners.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General submitted that a survey of the

land on which the Service Station is situated was carried out in 1993 by

M.A.Wadood, Licensed Surveyor. A copy of Survey Plan No. 632 prepared by

M.A.Wadood has been produced marked P11. This Court has examined P11

and observes that the extent of the total land depicted therein is 32.88

perches. The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General however claimed that

P11 is not a genuine document and has tendered to this Court marked R5, a

copy of the said Plan No. 632 prepared in 1993. While the extents and

boundaries in both P11 and R5 are the same, the significant difference is

that while P11 shows a wall separating the Petitioners property from the

land of the 1st Respondent, no such wall is depicted in R5. Instead R5 only

shows boundary stones and therefore contradicts the contents of CA2 and

CA3. Whether the boundary is demarcated by a wall or by boundary stones,

this Court must observe that there is a significant distance between the

building depicted therein and the boundary, and that this would have been the

situation on the ground as at 1993.

14

The Respondents state that in 2012, a fresh survey was obtained of the land

vested in the 1st Respondent. The plan prepared pursuant to the said survey is

Plan No. 4592, marked P8A as well as R3. The surveyor who prepared this

plan has superimposed the boundaries in Plan No. 632 (R5) and depicted the

boundaries of R5 in red.

The lot on which the filling station is presently situated is Lot No. 2 in extent of

17.20P. To the south of Lot No. 2 is Lot No. 5. The southern boundary of Lot

No. 5 on R3 is the southern boundary of the land depicted in Plan No. 632

(R5). In other words, Lot No. 5 in extent of 3.60P is the lot that the 1st

Respondent claims has been encroached by the Petitioners.

This Court must observe that if the southern boundary of Lot No. 2 in R3 is

taken to be correct, the building of the filling station is almost at the edge of

the boundary. However, if the southern boundary of the filling station is taken

as the southern boundary of Lot No. 5, to the naked eye, the distance between

the building and the boundary in Plan No. 4592 (P3) is the same or if not,

almost the same as the distance in Plan No. 632 (R5).

The Respondents have therefore clearly explained the manner in which the

land in extent of 32.88P on which the Service Station is situated was vested in

the 1st Respondent, and the manner in which encroachments of the said

property have taken place.

It is in this factual background that this Court shall now consider the two deeds

by which the immediate predecessor-in-title of the Petitioners acquired title to

the land purchased by the 1st Petitioner. This Court has examined Deed No.

15

3666 annexed to the petition marked P1 and observes that the said land is

depicted in Plan No. 607 dated 20th October 1979, marked P2.

The boundaries of the said land are as follows:

North Lanka Service Station

East Part of same land

South Central Clinic premises claimed by Dr. Eric Mendis

West Reservation for Road

This Court has examined P3, which is the Deed by which Dayawathie

Serasinghe acquired title in respect of 1.47P and observes the following:

(a) Karunasiri Serasinghe is claiming ownership to the said land by way of

long term possession since 1979;

(b) The boundaries of the said land are as follows:

North Lanka Service Station

East Part of same land

South Lot No. 1 of Plan No. 607 (i.e. P2)

West Reservation for Road

This Court therefore observes the following:

(a) The western boundary of both lots is the reservation for the road;

(b) The southern boundary of the 1.47P land is the plot of land in extent of

3.63P;

16

(c) The northern boundary of the land in Plan No. 607 and the northern

boundary of the land in P3 are one and the same, namely the Lanka

Service Station.

Thus, there has been a shifting of the northern boundary of the land owned by

Karunasiri Serasinghe by virtue of P1, when he claimed prescriptive title to

the strip of land in extent of 1.47 perches. Thus, it appears that the land in P3

is situated between the land referred to in P1 which is depicted in Plan No.

607, and the land occupied by the Lanka Service Station. Thus, going by the

Petitioners own documents, there has been a shifting of the Northern

boundary resulting in the encroachment of the land owned by the 1st

Respondent.

Issue with the names of the land claimed by the Petitioners and the Respondents

This Court shall now consider the first aspect of the second argument of the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners, which is that the names of the

two lands are different.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners submitted that the land

occupied by the Petitioners is known as Uda Demodara whereas the land

occupied by the Service station is known as Ethulhirekumbura. It is clear that K.

Don Peter Perera owned a land in extent of approximately 1A 1R, and that the

land in extent of 3.63P that was transferred to Karunasiri Serasinghe by Deed

marked P1 was part of the main land. Similarly, it is clear that the 32.88P that

was leased by K. Don Peter Perera to Shell Company and which subsequently

vested in the 1st Respondent was also part of the same land. The Petitioners

17

have in fact submitted marked P11 extracts relating to several other parts of

the said larger land owned by K. Don Peter Perera. Although P1 gives the

name of the land as Uda Demodara, the extract relating to P1, namely P4,

states that the land is also known as Kambikanuwa Kumbura alias Rerawa

Kumbura. The Tenement List marked P9A gives the name of the land as Uda

Demodara watte as well as Uda Demodara Kumbura. What is significant is

that: (a) the First Schedule of the Indenture of Lease of R1A refers to this

same land as Ethulhirekumbura; while (b) the Third Schedule of R1A refers to

this land as Ethulhirekumbura and refers further to the fact that this land is

also called Uda Demodera.

Furthermore, in the award marked R1, none other than K. Don Peter Pereras

son, who is a predecessor in title of the 1st Petitioner, refers to the fact that the

land on which the filling station is situated is known by the names of Uda

Demodara, Kambikanuwa Kumbura, Rerawa Kumbura and Ethulhirekumbura.

In these circumstances it is the view of this Court that the argument of the

learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners that the land claimed by them

and the land owned by the 1st Respondent are two different lands, has no

merit.

Issue with the extent of the land owned by the 1st Respondent

This Court shall now consider the argument of the learned Presidents Counsel

for the Petitioners that the extent of land that the 1st Respondent owns is only

12.16P, whereas according to Plan No. 4592, the extent of land occupied by

the filling station is greater i.e. 17.20P and therefore, the Respondents

18

cannot claim more than what they actually own. The learned Senior Deputy

Solicitor General submitted that although the extent of the land leased to Shell

Company in 1937 was only 12.16P, by 1959, K. Don Peter Perera had increased

the extent of the land leased to Shell Company to 32.88P, and that the

Indenture of Lease marked R1A was in force at the time the said property was

vested in the 1st Respondent. He therefore submitted that the 1st Respondent

is the owner of a land in extent of 32.88P on which the Filling Station operated

by the Welimada Multi-Purpose Cooperative Society is situated. The extent

that is owned by the 1st Respondent is confirmed further by the Survey Plan

No. 632 drawn in 1993. In these circumstances, it is clear to this Court that the

extent of land vested in the 1st Respondent is 32.88P.

Is the opinion of the Competent Authority reasonable?

This brings this Court back to the issue that arises for determination i.e. did

the Respondent act illegally or unreasonably or irrationally when he formed his

opinion that the land which is the subject matter of the said notice P8 is State

land. In considering this question, it would be useful to bear in mind the

description given by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister

for the Civil Service to the phrases illegality and irrationality:9

By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision

maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision

making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par

excellence a justiciable question to be decided in the event of dispute, by

9 1985 AC 374.

19

those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is

exercisable.

By irrationality I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as

Wednesbury unreasonableness.10 It applies to a decision which is so

outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no

sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided

could have arrived at it.

The test routinely applied when ascertaining if a decision taken by a public

authority meets the standards of reasonableness, is set out in Associated

Provincial Picture Houses Limited v. Wednesbury Corporation,11 which is

commonly referred to as Wednesbury unreasonableness. In this case, Lord

Greene defined unreasonableness as something so absurd that no sensible

person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority. The

famous example of the red-haired teacher who was dismissed due to the

colour of her hair, illustrates the high threshold for unreasonableness that

was expected to justify judicial intervention on this ground. 12

In Regina v. Hull University Visitor, Ex parte Page13 Lord Browne-Wilkinson,

after considering the aforementioned passage of Lord Diplock, observed as

follows:

10 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation (1948) 1 KB 223 11 Ibid. 12 Courts also may view a decision in light of the test contained in Secretary of State for Education and Science v.Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council [1977] AC 1014, where the circumstances warrant it, which is considered a less tortuous test than Wednesbury unreasonableness: In public law, unreasonableness as descriptive of the way in which a public authority has purported to exercise a discretion vested in it by statute has become a term of legal art. To fall within this expression it must be conduct which no sensible authority acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities would have decided to adopt. 13 [1993] AC 682 at page 701.

"Over the last 40 years, the courts have developed general principles of

judicial review. The fundamental principle [of judicial review] is that the

courts will intervene to ensure that the powers of public decision-making

bodies are exercised lawfully. In all cases, save possibly one, this

intervention by way of prohibition or certiorari is based on the proposition

that such powers have been conferred on the decision-maker on the

underlying assumption that the powers are to be exercised only within

the jurisdiction conferred, in accordance with fair procedures and, in

a Wednesbury sense reasonably. If the decision-maker exercises his

powers outside the jurisdiction conferred, in a manner which is

procedurally irregular or is Wednesbury unreasonable, he is acting ultra

vires his powers and therefore unlawfully." (emphasis added)

Conclusion

Taking into consideration the totality of the material that is available to this

Court, it is the view of this Court that:

(a) The opinion of the 2nd Respondent that the land referred to in the notice

P8 is State land is reasonable in light of the evidence placed before him

and presented to this Court, and is therefore an opinion that a sensible

person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have

arrived at;

(a) The 2nd Respondent therefore acted lawfully when he formed the opinion

that the land referred to in the notice P8 is State land to which the 1st

Respondent is lawfully entitled.

21

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any merit in the

application of the Petitioners. The application of the Petitioners is accordingly

dismissed, without costs.
