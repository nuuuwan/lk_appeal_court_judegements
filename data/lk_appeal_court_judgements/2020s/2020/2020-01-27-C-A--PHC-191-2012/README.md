The Petitioner in this case has filed this revision application

seeking to revise the order of the learned High Court Judge of Colombo,

dismissing the Petitioners application on the basis that a valid affidavit was

not filed.

Learned High Court Judge has mentioned that since the Affidavit

was not attested before Justice of Peace, the petition was rejected. But it is

apparent that this particular affidavit had been attested before a Consular

officer (Ambassador). Therefore it is apparent that in fact this is a duly

signed document. Learned State Counsel who is appearing for the Respondent

concedes the fact that the affidavit is duly signed and therefore the order

of the learned High Court Judge dated 06.08.2012 is set aside and this case

is sent back to the relevant High Court in order to decide the matter on

merits.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of this order to the

rdevant High Court of Colombo. The learned High Court Judge is directed

, to take steps to hear this matter and conclude as early as possible.
