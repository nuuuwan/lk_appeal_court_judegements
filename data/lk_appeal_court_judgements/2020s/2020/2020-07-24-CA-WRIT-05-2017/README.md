Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner had been issued annual permits from 2006 to

2012 to carry out fishing activities in Madel Padu No.6,

Thathanthanai, Mullaitivu. He has not been issued annual

permits since 2013. As seen from inter alia P6, P10, P11 and

P12, the Petitioner has been complaining of this matter to

various bodies including the subject Minister, the Human Rights

Commission and the President. All the said authorities have

instructed the Director General of Fisheries and Aquatic

Resources to issue the said permit to the Petitioner. But the

Director General, as seen from R4, has refused to issue the

same, on the ground that the Petitioner leased out the said Padu

in violation of Regulation 13(1) of the Madel (Beach Seine)

Fishing Regulations 1984, published in the Gazette marked R2.

The Petitioner has filed this writ application seeking to quash

the said decision also contained in P7 by certiorari and to

compel the Director General to uphold the recommendation of

the Human Rights Commission contained in P10.

Let me now consider the circumstances under which the

Director General issued R4 dated 01.10.2012.

By R1 and R3, it is seen that a complaint was made against the

Petitioner having leased out his Madel Padu to a third party,

namely, Lionel Livera and Liveras son. R3 reveals an inquiry

had been held into this complaint by the Officer in Charge of the

Mullaitivu police, at which Lionel Livera purportedly admitted he

(Livera) and his son were carrying out fishing activities in the

Petitioners Padu as lessees. It is on this basis the Director

4

General by R4 instructed the Assistant Director of Mullaitivu not

to issue an annual permit to the Petitioner for the said Padu.

It is relevant to note that the decision contained in R4 was not

taken upon an inquiry conducted by the Director General, nor

was it communicated to the Petitioner. Both the said acts are,

in my view, against the rules of natural justice.

Having so acted, the Director General cannot now say the

Petitioner in this writ application should have challenged the

decision in R4 not in P7. In the first place, the Petitioner should

have been informed of the decision in order to challenge R4. The

Director General did not even issue a copy of R4 to the

Petitioner.

The said conduct of the Director General has also effectively

prevented the Petitioner from appealing against the decision in

the manner set out in R2 (although the appeal process is not

clear). This is also in violation of natural justice.

The Petitioner, as a law-abiding citizen, had complained to the

Human Rights Commission about his grievance and the Human

Rights Commission held an inquiry. At the said inquiry, as seen

from the Human Rights Commission Report marked P10, inter

alia the Police Information Books relating to this dispute had

been called for and, upon perusing them, the Officer from the

Mullaitivu police admitted that Livera did not state to the police

he (Livera) was a lessee of the Petitioners Madel Padu. Vide, in

particular, the third paragraph of page 5 of P10.

5

The Report of the Human Rights Commission also makes

reference to a separate incident in 2012, where the Petitioner

had complained to the police of third parties obstructing him

from carrying out his work in his Padu. At an inquiry conducted

into the said complaint, the police obtained a statement from

Liveras son as evidence in support of the Petitioners complaint.

The said statement dated 08.10.2012 has been produced

marked P8. In this statement, Liveras son does not suggest the

Petitioner has leased out the said Padu to him and/or his father.

What he says therein is the Petitioner, who is his uncle, is the

owner of the said Padu and he (Liveras son) along with several

others work in it (for and on behalf of the Petitioner); he goes on

to say two third parties are obstructing them from carrying out

their activities. Vide also the last paragraph of page 3 of P10.

The Human Rights Commission, having rightly highlighted the

above and the fact that no proper inquiry was held prior to the

decision not to issue the permit to the Petitioner, strongly

recommends that the Director General reissue the permit to the

Petitioner.

However, the Director General by R5 has reiterated his original

position that the Petitioner had leased out the Padu, thereby

violating the Regulations marked R2. In R5 also, the Director

General refers to the police inquiry findings, which were proved

inaccurate before the Human Rights Commission.

In my view, once the Director General received the

recommendation of the Human Rights Commission, if he had

any doubts, he could have held a fresh inquiry and reconsidered

6

his decision. He did not do so. Instead, he relied on the same

initial police observations, which were found to be unreliable, to

affirm his previous decision.

It shall also be noted that even the Secretary to the President

has informed the Director General by P12 to implement the

recommendation of the Human Rights Commission, but the

Director General has not done so.

In the written submissions, the Respondents state that although

the Respondents are not under a legal obligation to give effect to

the recommendation of the Human Rights Commission, they

took steps, in good faith, to ascertain the possibility of reissuing

the permit to the Petitioner and thereafter recommended an

alternative Padu to the Petitioner, but the Petitioner was

uncooperative.

In my view, there is no reason for the Director General to give an

alternative Padu to the Petitioner. An alternative Padu could

have been given to the new person, if any, and the matter could

have been resolved.

In Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd. v. Human Rights Commission of Sri

Lanka (SC/APN/No.215/12, SC Minutes of 01.03.2017), the

Supreme Court held recommendations of the Human Rights

Commission attract writ jurisdiction. In the course of the

Judgment, Justice De Abrew declared: If a recommendation of a

Public Body affects the right of an individual, Superior Courts, in

the exercise of their writ jurisdiction, have the power to quash

such a recommendation by issuing a writ of certiorari. A fortiori,

if a recommendation of a public body protects the rights of an

7

individual, the superior Courts, in the exercise of writ

jurisdiction, have the power to compel the enforcement of such a

recommendation by issuing a writ of mandamus, if the Court is

satisfied the recommendation is made on compelling grounds.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, I take the view that

the refusal to issue the permit in respect of the disputed Padu to

the Petitioner without having held a proper inquiry is illegal, and

the refusal to carry out the recommendation of the Human

Rights Commission without a valid reason is unjustifiable.

I grant the Petitioner the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (c),

(d) and (e) of the prayer to the petition.

However, if the disputed Padu has now been given to a third

party, the permit shall be issued to the Petitioner to be operative

from 01.01.2021.

The application is allowed with costs.
