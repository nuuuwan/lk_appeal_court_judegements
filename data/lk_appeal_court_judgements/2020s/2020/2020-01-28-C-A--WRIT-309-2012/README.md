Street, Colombo 2. The Petitioner states that the 1st Respondent, who is the

Managing Director and/or Chairman of the 2nd Respondent had engaged in

widespread promotional campaigns from or around 2004 to promote the sale

of units in the said condominium property. The said property, which has been

described as a medium rise building consisting of several features set out in

the brochure annexed to the petition marked 'P3', included 32 residential

apartments/units with parking facilities. The Petitioner states that the ground

floor of the building consisted of an entrance lobby which has been

represented to the owners of the apartments as a common element of the

building, and is the subject matter of the dispute between the Petitioner and

the 1st and 2nd Respondents.

The 2nd Respondent, in its capacity as the developer of the said condominium

property, had constructed and sold apartments/units of the said property to

members of the Petitioner. Many members of the Petitioner, acting on the

representations made to them by the 1st and 2nd Respondents and relying on

the contents of 'P3', had entered into Sale and Purchase Agreements with the

2nd Respondent. A sample Sale and Purchase Agreement dated 1st September

2005, has been annexed to the petition marked 'P4'.

The Petitioner states that in the said agreement 'P4', the 2nd Respondent had

given the following specific undertaking to adhere and comply with the

approved building plan, the apartment plan and other documentation

attached thereto.

"Clause A:

The construction of the said Apartment shall be in accordance with the

said building Plan, building description and specifications set out in the

aforesaid documents marked A, B, C and signed and agreed on by the

parties hereto which shall form part and parcel of this Agreement.

The Vendor shall have the right to make alterations including structural

alterations to the building Plan marked 'X' in the event the Vendor's

Contractors/ Consultants advising the Vendor that such alterations are

essential and necessary for the perfect and safe construction of the

Condominium provided such alterations do not contravene any by-laws,

Statutory Laws or Regulations.

PROVIDED HOWEVER

The Vendor undertakes as far as possible to adhere to and comply with

the approved building plan marked 'X' and the Apartment Plan herein

before referred to as specifications mentioned hereto and which the

purchaser/s acknowledge/s as having been seen and examined before

further changes, alterations and/or deviations from the said specifications

and plans as shall be required by the local or any state authority or on

advise by the Vendor's Contractor/Architect, who is of the opinion that

such changes/deviations/ alterations are essential for the safe and perfect

construction of the building/apartment. The Purchaser/s shall not be liable

for such costs of such changes/alterations and/or deviations."

The Petitioner states that after the completion of the construction of the

building, many of its members took possession of the said residential

apartment/units from mid 2006, even though they had not obtained the title

deeds to their respective apartments from the 2nd Respondent.

The Petitioner states that in 2011, it obtained from the 6th Respondent, the

Colombo Municipal Council, a copy of the Certificate of Conformity dated 21st

July 2006, annexed to the petition marked 'P6' issued to the 2nd Respondent by

the 6th Respondent. The Petitioner states that upon a perusal of 'P6', it

transpired that the 2nd Respondent had amended the approved building plan,

which a majority of the members of the Petitioner had relied upon at the time

of entering into their respective Sale and Purchase Agreements. The Petitioner

states further that the said amended plan, annexed to the petition marked

'P7', continued to depict the main common element on the Ground Floor as an

"Entrance Lobby", which is in line with what was represented to the

purchasers in their Sale and Purchase Agreements. To that extent, the

Petitioner has no issue with 'P7'.

The Petitioner states that the 2nd Respondent had subsequently obtained

approval for yet another building Plan dated 26th August 2008 annexed to the

petition marked 'P8', which had replaced the entrance lobby, which, according

to 'P7' was the main common element on the ground floor, to a "retail shop".

The Petitioner states that the said change was done without the approval!

consent of the owners or members of the Petitioner Corporation. The

Certificate of Conformity (COC) dated 6th October 2008, issued by the 6th

Respondent to the 2nd Respondent, annexed to the petition marked 'pg',

reflects the said amendment.2

The Petitioner states that subsequently, the 3'd Respondent had issued a

Certificate for Common Amenities and Common Elements of the Building/

Buildings of Condominium Property annexed to the petition marked 'P16',

dated 30th December 2008 to the 2nd Respondent for 33 residential units, one

corporate office and one retail shop at No. 66 Park Street Colombo 02.

Aggrieved by the decision to grant approval to the amended building plan 'PS',

the Petitioner had complained to the 3'd Respondent by letter dated 14th

March 2012, marked 'P1S'. The Petitioner states that they had made three

further written complaints, dated 2th June 2012 marked 'P22', 29th June 2012

marked 'P23' and th August 2012 marked 'P24' to the 3'd Respondent relating

to a number of issues with the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The main complaint of

the Petitioner however remained the conversion of the entrance lobby to a

retail shop contrary to the representations made at the time the apartments

were sold, thereby depriving the apartment owners of an area which had been

identified as a common element.

Provision with regard to the holding of an inquiry is found in Section 9(1) of the

Condominium Management Authority Law, which reads as follows:

"The Authority, may on its own motion, or on the application of a majority

of the members of the management corporation or corporation or of not

2 'P9' contains a note at the end which states that, "This Certificate of Conformity is issued considering the letter of Indemnity dated 02.10.2008 and the letter of undertoking dated 01.10.2008 submitted by the Developer. "

less than one-third of the owners of the Condominium Parcels of the

Condominium Property or Semi Condominium Property, hold an inquiry, or

direct a person authorized in writing in that behalf, by the Authority by

order to hold an inquiry into the activities and financial stability of the

management corporation. N

In terms of Section 9(3), "Where an inquiry is held under subsection (1) the

Authority or the person authorized by the Authority to hold the inquiry shall

alter due inquiry make order as regards the management corporation and shall

communicate the order of the inquiry to all the owners of the condominium

Parcels of the Condominium property or Semi Condominium Property. N

The Petitioner states that the 3rd Respondent had appointed the 5th

Respondent to conduct an inquiry into the said complaints, and the said

inquiry had accordingly been held on 14th August 2012. The 4th Respondent,

the General Manager of the 3rd Respondent, by his letter dated 20th August

2012 annexed to the petition 'P29' had informed to the Petitioner the

outcome of the inquiry. 'P29' reads as follows:

"Your kind attention is drawn to the inquiry conducted by the

Condominium Management Authority regarding the above matter.

At the inquiry it was revealed that Expo Victoria Property Developers (Pvt)

Ltd has not encroached part of the lobby violating the approved plan No.

(Ref No: ME/PBS/BA/ll/0B dated 26th August 200if) approved by the

Colombo Municipal Council.

, Marked 'P8'.

Accordingly comploint of 14th March 2012 made by Expo Victoria Towers

Management Corporation is hereby dismissed."

The Petitioner states that it obtained from the 3rd Respondent, a copy of the

proceedings of the said inquiry conducted on 14th August 2012, which has

been annexed to the petition marked 'P32'.

The complaint of the Petitioner to this Court is two fold .

The first complaint, which is borne out by the proceedings 'P32', is that the

Inquiry Officer proceeded on the assumption that the 6th Respondent had

allocated a separate assessment number for the said retail shop, which the

Petitioner claim is erroneous. The 6th Respondent has in fact very specifically

submitted in its written submissions that a separate assessment number - i.e.

No. 68 - has not been allocated to the said retail shop. Thus, it is clear to this

Court that the Inquiry Officer has made a fundamental error when considering

the complaint of the Petitioner and has acted on material which had not been

su bstantiated.

What is significant however is the second complaint of the Petitioner, which is

that 'P29' does not contain any reasons for the decision of the 3rd Respondent.

This Court has re-produced in its entirety, the decision of the 3rd Respondent,

which, as submitted by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner, does not give

the Petitioner the reasons as to why the Inquiry Officer decided to dismiss the

complaint of the Petitioner.

In Jayantha Liyanage vs Commissioner of Elections4, the Supreme Court held

as follows:

"Any act of the repository of power, whether administrative or quasi-

judicial, is open to challenge if it is in conflict with the governing Act or the

general principles of law of the land or is arbitrary and unreasonable that

no fair minded authority could ever had made it. The recording and giving

of reasons therefore ensures that the decision of the repository of power is

reached according to law and not on the basis of caprice, whim or fancy.

A person seeking to register his party as a recognized political party is

ordinarily entitled to know the grounds on which the Commissioner of

Elections has rejected his claim. If the decision of the Commissioner of

Elections is subject to appeal or judicial review, the necessity to give

reasons is greater, for without reasons, firstly, the persons aggrieved by

the decision of the Commissioner of Elections would not be in a position to

formulate the legal basis on which he could challenge such decision by

way of appeal or judicial review. Secondly, the appellate authority would

not have any material on which it may determine whether the facts were

properly ascertained, the relevant law was correctly applied and the

decision was within the parameters of the Commissioner of Elections."

The above position was reiterated by the Supreme Court in Sumedha

Jayaweera vs Professor Oayasiri Fernando and othersS where it was held as

follows:

4 SC Appeal No. 96/2011; SC Minutes of 17'h December 2014.

5 SC (FR) 484/2011; SC Minutes of 16h January 2017; Sripavan, O.

"Giving of reasons is an essential element of administration of justice. A

right to reason is, therefore, an indispensable part of a sound system of

judicial review. Reasoned decision is not only for the purpose of showing

that the citizen is receiving justice, but also a valid discipline for the

administrative body itself. Conveying reasons is calculated to prevent

unconscious, unfairness or arbitrariness in reaching the conclusions. The

very search for reasons will put the authority on the alert and minimize

the chances of unconscious infiltration of bias or unfairness in the

conclusion. The duty to adduce reasons will be regarded as fair and

legitimate by a reasonable man and will discard irrelevant and extraneous

considerations. Therefore, conveying reasons is one of the essentials of

justice (Vide S. N. Mukherjee Vs. Union of India (1990) 4 S.Cc.c. 594; A.I.R.

1990S.C.1984)"

In the above circumstances, this Court issues a Writ of Certiorari quashing the

decision contained in 'P29' due to the failure on the part of the 4th Respondent

to adduce reasons for its decision. This Court also issues a Writ of Mandamus

directing the 3rd Respondent to conduct a fresh inquiry into the complaints of

the Petitioner, afford the Petitioner and all parties including the 1st and 2nd

Respondents an opportunity of placing all relevant material before them, and

if necessary to lead oral testimony and thereafter pronounce its decision, with

reasons for such decision. The said Inquiry shall commence as expeditiously as

possible and shall be concluded within a period of four months from today.

This Court makes no order with regard to costs.
