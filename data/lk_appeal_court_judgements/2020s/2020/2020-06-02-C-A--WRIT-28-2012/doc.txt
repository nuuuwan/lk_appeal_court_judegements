Janak De Silva J.

The 4th to 6th Respondents made a complaint to the Commissioner of Labour that although they

were employees of the Petitioner, they were not paid their Employees Provident Fund (EPF)

dues.

After inquiry the Petitioner received a letter/certificate directing it to pay a sum of Rs.

717,522.48 as EPF dues under and in terms of the Employees Provident Fund Act (EPF Act). The

Petitioner is challenging this decision.

The Petitioner contends that:

(1) The 4th to 6th Respondents is not "employees" of the Petitioner within the meaning of

the EPF Act.

Page 2 of 11

(2) The Petitioner was not given a fair hearing in that:

(i) The Petitioner raised a preliminary objection that the 4 th to 6 th Respondents

were not "employees" of the Petitioner but the inquiry was concluded without a

hearing on the merits

(ii) The Petitioner was not given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses

(ii) The 1st to 3rd Respondents failed to communicate the decision and reasons for it.

Employer-Employee relationship

The Petitioner contends that it obtained the services of a security company and the 4th to 6th

Respondents were working as security guards in the premises of the Petitioner under that

security company.

Later the 4th to 6th Respondents resigned from that security company and formed a group of

their own of which the 4 th Respondent was the head and offered to provide the Petitioner

security services on contract basis which was accepted by the Petitioner. Thereafter the

Petitioner agreed to pay a fixed amount to the 4 th Respondent monthly for the services

provided on a contract basis as in the case of the contract for security service with their earlier

company. The Petitioner denies that the 4 th to 6th Respondents were its "employees" within the

meaning of the EPF Act which is disputed by the 4 th to 6th Respondents.

In this context it is important to bear in mind the legal principle that the characterization by the

parties of the nature of the contract between them is not determinative of the true legal

relationship between them.

Lord Denning in Facchini v. Bryson [(1952) 1 Times Law Reports 1386 at 1389] held:

"The occupation has all the features of a service tenancy, and the parties cannot by the

mere words of their contract turn it into something else. Their relationship is

determined by the law and not by the label which they choose to put upon it."

(Emphasis added)

Page 3 of 11

This decision was cited with approval in Ferguson v. John Dowson and Partners (Contractors)

Ltd. [(1976) EWCA Civ 7, (1976) 1 W.L.R. 1213) where it was held:

"[A) declaration by the parties, even if it be incorporated in the contract, that the

workman is to be, or is to be deemed to be, self-employed, an independent

contractor, ought to be wholly disregarded -not merely treated as not being

conclusive - if the remainder of the contractual terms, governing the realities of the

relationship, show the relationship of employer and employee. The Roman soldier

would not have been a self-employed labour-only sub-contractor because of any verbal

exchange between him and the centurion when he enlisted. I find difficulty in accepting

that the parties, by a mere expression of intention as to what the legal relationship

should be, can in any way influence the conclusion of law as to what the relationship is."

(Emphasis added)

Sharvananda J. (as he was then) adopted this principle in Y.G. de Silva v. The Associated

Newspapers [BAUR (1983) Vol. 1 Part III p. 118], [(1978-79) Sri.L.R. 173] when he held that it is

irrelevant that the parties have declared their relationship to be something else. The rationale

is that due to the difference in bargaining power between the parties the employer can force

the employees to declare in the contract that they are not employees when as a matter of law

for the application of the relevant statutory rules they are in law employees of the employer.

The issue then is the true relationship between the parties as a matter of law. Courts have

adopted different tests to be applied in determining this issue.

The control test articulated by MacKenna J. in Ready Mixed Concrete Ltd. (South East) v.

Minister of Pensions [(1968) 1 All E.R. 433 at 439-40] is as follows:

"A contract of service exists if these three conditions are fulfilled. (i) The servant agrees

that, in consideration of a wage or other remuneration, he will provide his own work

and skill in the performance of some service for his master. (ii) He agrees, expressly or

impliedly, that in the performance of that service he will be subject to the other's

Page 4 of 11

control in sufficient degree to make that other master. (iii) The other provisions of the

contract are consistent with its being a contract of service."

The integration test adopted in Y.G. de Silva v. The Associated Newspapers (supra) have two

components. Firstly, it considers whether the work done is an integral part of the business and

Secondly, whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation.

The economic reality test which closely resembles the integration test poses the question

whether the persons were employees as a matter of economic reality which test was cited with

approval in Free Lanka Trading Co. Ltd. v. w.L.P. de Mel, Commissioner aJ Labaur [79 (II) N.L.R.

158].

Let me examine the available evidence in this matter.

One important element in a contract of services is the payment of wages or other remuneration

between the parties.

The Petitioner did not pay any wages to the 5th and 6th Respondents. The names of the 4 th to 6th

Respondents do not appear in the pay register of the Petitioner. Instead, the Petitioner paid a

monthly sum to the 4 th Respondent for the security services supplied and he paid what is due to

the 5th and 6th Respondents. All vouchers for the payment of security services was in the name

of the 4 th Respondent. This is consistent with the position of the Petitioner that the 4th

Respondent was the leader of the team that offered their services and accordingly he was paid

which he in turn distributed to the other two.

In Ceylon Mercantile Union v. Ceylan Fertilizer Carparation [(1985) 1 Sri.L.R. 401] Samarakoon

c.J. in his minority decision held that a similar arrangement did not amount to the payment of

wage agreed between the parties. However, the learned counsel for the 4th to 6th Respondents

contended that the majority concluded that the arrangement was a subterfuge to overcome

the application of labour laws. But the reasoning for that conclusion was that the contact

between the parties was most tenous and that in truth and in fact the wages were calculated

and determined by the Ceylon Fertilizer Corporation. Nonetheless, it cannot be said that the

relationship between the 4 th, 5th and 6th Respondents were tenous in nature.

Page 5 of 11

The 4th to 6th Respondents did not produce any contract of employment with the Petitioner

showing the right of suspension or dismissal. Of course that is not decisive as there can be an

implied contract of employment. Yet, there was no evidence led to show of any particular

instance where the Petitioner sought to exercise such a right during the seven year period

when the security services were supplied. In Short v. J. & W. Henderson Ltd. [(1945-1946) 62

T.A. 427, 429] the House of Lords held that the master's right of suspension or dismissal is one

of the indicia of a contract of service.

The 4th to 6th Respondents did not sign the attendance book maintained by the Petitioner in

relation to the other employees. They maintained their own book and got it signed by the

Accountant of the Petitioner.

In my view. these factors negate any conclusion that there was a contract of service between

the Petitioner and the 4th to 6th Respondents by applying the control test. As MacKenna J. held

in Ready Mixed Concrete Ltd. (South East) v. Minister oj Pensions (supra page 440-1):

"If the provisions of the contract as a whole are inconsistent with its being a contract of

service, it will be some other kind of contract, and the person doing the work will not be

a servant,"

Applying the integration test, there is no evidence to show that the work done by the 4th to 6th

Respondents were an integral part of the business of the Petitioner or that they are part and

parcel of the Petitioner.

Neither is there evidence that the 4th to 6th Respondents were employees of the Petitioner as a

matter of economic reality.

It is true that the 4th to 6th Respondents were issued identity cards by the Petitioner. But the

evidence taken as a whole negates any relationship of employer-employee between the

parties.

Page 6 of 11

Therefore, I hold that the 4th to 6th Respondents have failed to prove that they were employees

of the Petitioner within the meaning of the EPF Act. Hence the conclusion of the Respondents

that there is a contract of services between the Petitioner and the 4th to 6th Respondents is not

supported by the evidence led at the inquiry.

Generally, courts exercising judicial review do not review errors of fact made by administrative

bodies/officials, unless those errors of fact are linked to the assumption of the administrative

body's jurisdiction i.e. jurisdictional errors of facts. [R v. Fulham, Hammersmith and Kensington

Rent Tribunal (1951) 2 K. B. 1 at 6; Walter Leo v. Land Commissioner 57 N.L.R. 178].One

exception to this general principle is the 'no evidence rule'. Wade and Forsythe, Administrative

Law, 7th Edition at page 312 observes as follows:

"'no evidence' does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It extends to any case

where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable af supporting the

finding, or where, in other words, no tribunal could reasonably reach that conclusion

on that evidence""""". "It seems clear that this ground of judicial review ought now to

be regarded as established on a general basis'~ and forecasts that 'no evidence' seems

destined to take its place as yet a further branch of the principle of ultra vires, so that

Acts giving powers of determination will be taken to imply that the determination

must be based on some acceptable evidence. If it is not, it will be treated as 'arbitrary,

capricious and obviously unauthorised'," (Emphasis added)

The observations made by the text writers about this ground of judicial review have been

adopted and endorsed by the Supreme Court in Kiriwanthe v Navaratne [(1990) 2 SrLL.R. 393 at

409] and in Nalini Ellegala v Poddalagoda [(1999) 1 SrLL.R. 46 at 52].ln Nicholas v Markan

Morkar [(1985) 1 SrLL.R. 130, pp. 140 - 141] the Court of Appeal cited with approval the

following dictum about the 'no evidence rule' in the leading English case of Edwards v. Bairstow

[1956] A.C. 14:

""it may be that the facts faund are such that na persan acting judicially and praperly

instructed as to the relevant law could have come to the determination under appeal. In

those circumstances, too, the court must intervene. It has no option but to assume that

Page 7 of 11

there has been some misconception of the law, and that this has been responsible for

the determination ..... I do not think that it matters much whether this state of affairs is

described as one in which there is no evidence to support the determination, or as one

in which the evidence is inconsistent with, and contradictory of, the determinatian, or

os one in which the true and only reasonable conclusion contradicts the

determination". (Emphasis added)

In effect, the no evidence rule has opened up a very narrow path for courts to review non

jurisdictional errors of facts. In the UK, a finding by an administrative body that has been made

in ignorance of established and relevant evidence has been held to be amenable to judicial

review. [Regina v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board Ex Parte A (A.P.) [1999] 2 AC 330;

Secretary of State for Education and Science v Tameside MBC [1976] UKHL 6].

In Hasseen v Gunasekara and others rCA Application No. 128/86 C.A.M. 02.10.1995] this Court

considered an order of the Rent Board of Review, affirming an order of the Rent Board which

had been "arrived at without an adequate evaluation of the evidence and by failing to take into

consideration relevant items of evidence which could have influenced the finding" and held the

Rent Board as well as the Board of Review had "erred in law by failing to take into account

relevant items of evidence in arriving at the finding" and therefore quashed the orders of the

Rent Board as well as of the Board of Review

Accordingly, the determination made by the 1st to 3rd Respondents that the Petitioner was the

employer of the 4th to 6th Respondents is liable to be quashed on this basis.

Preliminary Objection

The contention of the Petitioner is that at the inquiry, it raised a preliminary objection and the

inquiry was concluded without giving it an opportunity of making representations on the merits

and as such it was denied a fair hearing.

Page 8 of 11

I am unable to accede to this position. The inquiry officer made a finding overruling the

preliminary objection of the Petitioner and thereafter held that there exist merits worthy of

summoning the parties for further inquiry. The parties were summoned again on 25.05.2011 for

further inquiry on which date the Petitioner was represented by counsel.

However, it appears that further evidence from the 4th to 6th Respondents have been taken in

the absence of the Petitioner. Although the Respondents contest this position, the record

shows that such evidence was taken in the absence of the Petitioner.

Where evidence is taken without the knowledge of a party and without giving it an opportunity

of responding to it, there is no fair hearing [Taylor v. National Union of Seaman (1967) 1 W.L.R.

532, Errington v. Minister of Health (1935) 1 K.B. 249].

Crass-Examination

The learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner contended that no cross-examination of the

witnesses was permitted by the Department of Labour and as such there was no fair hearing.

The proceedings marked R2 to R6 does not reflect any cross-examination having taken place.

The question then is whether this deprives the parties of a fair hearing.

In my view it is not imperative to provide for cross-examination in all instances for there to be a

fair hearing. Whether crass-examination must be allowed depends on the circumstances of

each case.

In R. v. Commissioner for Racial Equality, ex parte Cottrel and Rothon [(1980) 1 W.L.R. 1580 at

1587-1588] Lord Lane CJ held:

"It seems to me that there are degrees of judicial hearing, and those degrees run from

the borders of pure administration to the borders of the full hearing of a criminal cause

or matter in the Crown Court. It does not profit one to try to pigeon-hole the particular

set of circumstances either into the administrative pigeon-hole or into the judicial

pigeon-hole. Each case will inevitably differ, and one must ask oneself what is the basic

nature of the proceeding which was going on there. It seems to me that, basically, this

Page 9 of 11

was an investigation carried being carried out by the commission. It is true that in the

course of the investigation the commission may form a view, but it does not seem to me

that that is a proceeding which requires, in the name of fairness, any right in the firm in

this case to be able to cross-examine witnesses whom the commission have seen and

from whom they have taken statements."

A similar approach was taken by the Supreme Court in Chulasubadra De Silva v. The University

of Colombo and Others [(1986) 2 Sr.L.R. 288] where it held that a tribunal like the Examination

Committee exercising quasi-judicial functions is not a Court and therefore is not bound to

follow the procedure prescribed for actions in courts nor is it bound by strict rules of evidence.

It was further held that it can unlike a Court obtain all information material for the issues under

inquiry from all sources and through all channels without being fettered by rules of procedure

and that where its procedure is not regulated by statute, it is free to adopt a procedure of its

own, so long as it conforms to principles of natural justice.

In this case, the complaint of the Petitioner stems from steps taken by the Commissioner

General of Labour to recover EPF dues owed to the 4 th to 6th Respondents by the Petitioner.

Prior to doing so, an inquiry had been conducted by the Department of Labour as reflected by

R2 to R6.

The learned State Counsel contended that there is no legal necessity to hold a formal inquiry. It

is true that the EPF Act does not specifically provide for any formal inquiry into a complaint

made by an employee in relation to his outstanding EPF dues. Nonetheless I am unable to

accede to this position as the Commissioner General has been given wide powers in terms of

the EPF Act to regulate and monitor the several statutory provisions therein. It provides

effective different procedures by which the outstanding EPF dues can be recovered from a

defaulting employer. In order for the Commissioner General of Labour to exercise his powers

under and in terms of the EPF Act in a fair manner, the employer must be given a fair hearing to

respond to any complaint made by an employee. Although the EPF Act is a piece of social

legislation, it does not mean that employers are deprived of basic and fundamental safeguards

Page 10 of 11

in law. An inquiry where the employer is given a fair hearing is in my view an indispensable

requirement.

However, there is no requirement for such an inquiry to provide for an opportunity of cross-

examination. The Commissioner General of Labour is not exercising any judicial power in the

strict sense in such an inquiry. At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Commissioner General of

Labour can, inter alia, make an application to the Magistrates Court in terms of section 38(2) of

the EPF Act. Whilst it is true that the scope of such proceedings have been made narrow by the

EPF Act and judicial pronouncement, that in my view is insufficient to impose a requirement of

cross-examination into such an inquiry.

For all the foregoing reasons, I issue a writ of certiorari quashing the document P6. There is no

need for the quashing of P7 as it does not contain any decision, and P8 as it is only a follow up

ofthe decision embodied in P6.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed without costs.
