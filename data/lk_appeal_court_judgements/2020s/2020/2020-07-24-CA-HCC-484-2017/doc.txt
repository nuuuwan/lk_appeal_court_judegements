ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted by the Hon Attorney General, before the High Court of Kuliyapitiya,

under two counts of attempted murder for causing injuries to Ezra Dishan

Alexander and Hettiarachchilage Nandana Pradeep Kumara, by attacking them with a

manna knife on 25.03.2009 at Makandura .

Upon being elected to be tried without a jury, the trial against the

Appellant proceeded. He offered evidence under oath when the High Court

ruled that he had a case to answer at the end of the prosecution case. The

prosecution called a witness in rebuttal and at the conclusion of the trial, the

High Court found the Appellant guilty to both counts and was sentenced to

seven year term of imprisonment each on the two counts of attempted murder.

In respect of the 1st count, the Appellant was imposed a fine of Rs. 10,000.00 with

a default term of six months. He was also ordered to pay Rs. 300,000.00 to the

PW1 as compensation and in default a twelve-month imprisonment for the said

count. In respect of the 2 nd count, the Appellant was imposed a fine of Rs.

10,000.00 with a three-month default term of imprisonment. The High Court also

ordered to pay Rs. 200,000.00 as compensation to PW2 which carried a default

term of imprisonment for eight months.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellant sought

to have them set aside on the basis that the trial Court had failed to properly

analyse the infirmities of the evidence of prosecution witnesses and therefore

2

.r-------------------------------------------------------------------------------,

arrived at an erroneous conclusion that their evidence is truthful and reliable,

contrary to the accepted principles in evaluating such evidence.

Learned President's Counsel for the Appellant contended that the trial

Court had failed to give due weightage to the fact that none of the two injured

persons have implicated the Appellant, until their statements were recorded after

25 days since the incident. It also failed to consider the several inter se and per se

contradictions in the testimonies of the two injured persons. He further

contended that the trial Court had imposed an undue burden on the Appellant to

raise reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.

Proper consideration of these contentions advanced by the Appellant

require an examination of the correctness of the reasoning of the trial Court in

arriving at its conclusion; that the evidence of the two injured persons reflect a

truthful and reliable account of the circumstances under which they were

attacked, when viewed against the backdrop of the prosecution version of

events.

The prosecution case was naturally reliant on the evidence of the two

injured persons, namely Rev. Ezra Dishan Alexander and Hettiarachchilage Nandana

Pradeep Kumara. Rev. Ezra Dishan Alexander is a priest of Vineyard Community

Church, which offered religious services to its congregation in a prayer centre in

Makandura. He used to travel regularly to the said payer hall from Kandy on

Sundays to conduct religious services to the faithful, but would also visit the

3

'r--------------------------------------------------------------------------,

centre on Wednesdays occasionally. A person called Akila used to reside at the

prayer centre.

The prayer hall, which was housed in a long building, consisted of a hall

for the congregation and also of living quarters, adjacent to the hall, meant for

the visiting priest. It is in this section that the attack on the two injured had

taken place. The prayer centre was built on a land where a developer had

blocked out several plots of land which are in extent of about 25 perches each.

Majority of the residents in this scheme belonged to a different religious order.

Only about 5 or 6 families lived in and around Makandura area, belong to the said

Church, which conducted regular religious services from the said prayer centre.

On the day of the incident (25.03.2009), Rev. Alexander had arrived at the

prayer centre towards the evening. The priest was thereafter having a long

conversation with Kumara, whose wife was trained by the Church as a clerk. At

about 6.30 p.m. they heard the voice of a male shouting" I will kill all of you"

(@OS ci@CDJ O/:DOJ) just outside the door of the living quarters. Rev. Alexander

had recognised the voice of the Appellant. Immediately after the shouting, the

Appellant appeared at the door to the room, in which the two injured were. The

door was ajar and the Appellant entered through the doorway and struck with

his manna knife on the witness's head. The witness attempted to defend himself

with the next attack, during which he sustained a cut injury to his hand. He then

fell on to his bed while Kumara grappled with the Appellant. The Appellant then

struck twice on the head of Kumara who pleaded with him to go without causing

4

.~-------------------------------------------------------------------------,

any trouble. The witness also saw a part of the blade of manna knife was broken

after the attack.

The witness knew the Appellant prior to this incident over his protests for

the religious practices conducted at the prayer centre. He is the immediate

neighbour of the prayer centre and had a common boundary wall separating his

property from the prayer centre.

Witness Kumara too gave evidence on same lines as his priest. As he heard

the shouting by the Appellant, the witness saw him enter the room. He

intervened to prevent attack on the priest but was pushed aside by the Appellant

who thereafter struck twice on the head of the priest before turning to him. The

witness was also struck twice on his head. Before the Appellant went away, he

had again approached Rev Alexander and cut his mouth.

The two injured were rushed initially to Sandalankawa Hospital and then

transferred to Negombo General Hospital. They were thereafter transferred to the

National Hospital upon their request, where they were examined and treated.

Dr Hewamadduma had examined Kumara at ward No. 64 of National

Hospital and his bed-head ticket No. 736367 indicated that he was admitted on

26.03.2009 at 11.10 a.m. Kumara complained that he was attacked with a cutting

weapon in the night of 25th by a "known person". At the time of medical

examination, he has already undergone an operation in relation to the head 5

.r--------------------------------------------------------------------------,

inJury, which had resulted in the fracture of skull bone and extradural

haemorrhage. This injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause

death as opined by the medical witness.

The Medico Legal Report concerning Rev. Alexander was admitted under

Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and without

calling the medical officer who examined the said injured. In relation to the

contents of short history as admitted by the parties, the Appellant made a

specific denial in the said admission of the short history to the effect that he had

not inflicted any injury on the said injured.

It is revealed that the Police had visited the scene in the absence of both

injured and recovered a broken part of a blade of a cutting weapon.

In view of the above evidence, this Court now ventures to consider the

submissions of the Appellant in relation to the several grounds of appeal.

It was submitted that the Appellant had totally denied of any involvement

with causing injuries to any of the injured and he contends that the two injured

have falsely implicated him due to his resentment shown for the prayer services

conducted in the prayer centre, given the fact that the Appellant, being the

immediate neighbour of the prayer centre.

6

'r--------------------------------------------------------------------------,

In view of those circumstances, learned President's Counsel contended,

that the failure to name the Appellant that very night they sustained injuries,

upon being questioned by the examining medical officer at the National Hospital

and the unexplainable delay of 25 days to name the Appellant as the attacker,

militate against the core prosecution allegation against him.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in his reply contended that the identity

of the Appellant is well known to the two injured and the failure to name the

appellant to the medical officers causes no dent in the truthfulness in their

evidence and it could well be that the injury on the mouth of Rev Alexander

prevented him from making a detailed account of what transpired that evening.

He added that there was no motive for any of the injured to falsely implicate the

Appellant and the subsequent conduct of the Appellant, who had gone missing

after the incident, indicate that he was promptly accused of causing the injuries

and was wanted by the Police.

It is clear that the challenge made on the validity of the conviction entered

against the Appellant is in turn based on the correctness of the conclusion

reached by the trial Court after applying the Test of Spontaneity or the Test of

Contemporaneity on the evidence of the two injured persons. It is evident from

the submissions of the learned President's Counsel that he challenges the

testimonial trustworthiness of the injured, firstly, on their failure to name the

Appellant on the first available opportunity at the National Hospital and,

secondly, on their implication of him only after a lapse of 25 days. Hence, it is

appropriate that the said contention of the Appellant is considered by this Court

under these two aspects, although they are conceptually intertwined. The

evidence relating to them are somewhat distinguishable in relation to each of

these aspects. 7

The date of offence as specified in the indictment is 25.03.2009. The

Statements of Rev Alexander and Pradeep Kumara were recorded by PS 31575

Jayasuriya on 20.04.2009 at Pannala Police Station. The Appellant was arrested on

03.05.2009 at about 5.20 a.m. by the said witness, near Pannala bus stand.

The evidence as to the short history as recorded in the Medico Legal

Reports of the two injured are as reproduced below;

a. the two injured were admitted and treated at National Hospital in

Ward No. 64 and they occupied adjoining beds,

b. they were examined by two different medical officers. Witness Pradeep

Kumara was exmined on 26.03.2009 at 11.10 a.m. by Dr.Hewamadduma

while Rev Alexander was examined by Dr Sufine on 27.03.2009,

c. none of the two injured have implicated the Appellant in the short

history, upon being questioned by the medical officer,

d. Dr Hewamadduma was emphatic that Pradeep Kumara only said that he

was attacked by a "known person",

e. Rev Alexander claimed in evidence that, upon being questioned by the

medical officer as to how he sustained injuries, he replied" 61llS<; !5\c;,@

@tll@.roci @tllgCl", contrary to the recorded version of the history as given

by him.

The evidence in relation to the reasons for the delay in making a statement

to Police are summarise below.

In his evidence, Rev Alexander sought to explain the delay in making the

statement to Police was due to him acting on the advice to rest for some time. He

maintains that he had mentioned the Appellant's name as the attacker to 8

everyone who questioned him as to the cause of the injuries. It is not clear as to

why his statement was not recorded by the Police post of the National Hospital

since he was admitted to that hospital with a clear history of attack by a known

person. It is also not known which Police issued Medico Legal Examination form

requesting that the two injured be examined by a Judicial Medical Officer.

Similarly, witness Kumara too made a bleated statement. He was treated at

the National Hospital for two days and was discharged. He then continued with

treatment of his injuries at Makandura Hospital. He candidly admitted that he

never made a complaint since his Church had already initiated action. He also

claims the delay in making a statement to Police was due to medical advice to

rest for a while.

It is during cross-examination, witness Kumara admitted that soon after the

incident a person called Upul had rushed to the scene. The witness said that he

told Upul what transpired at the prayer centre.

In the judgment of Haramanis v Somalatha (1998) 3 Sri L.R. 365, Jayasuriya J described the applicable consideration in the Tests of Spontaneity and

Contemporaneity are as follows;

"The law in its wisdom requires thatthe statement should be made

within a reasonable time. The test is whether it was made as early as

could reasonably be expected in the circumstances and whether

there was or was not time for tu taring and concoction. It is a

9

question of fact depending on the attendant circumstances of the

case. No hard and fast rule can be laid down as to when a statement

is sufficiently contemporaneous."

It is thus apparent from the wording that longer the delay in making a

statement turn results in a greater probability of "tutoring and concoction". If a

particular witness's testimony fails to satisfy the Tests of Spontaneity and

Contemporaneity, the resultant position was considered in Jayawardena &

Others v The State (2000) 3 Sri L.R. 192, where it was held;

"It is needless to say that such a long delay without reasonable

grounds would make the evidence of the complainant, who is the

only witness to the robbery suspicious and unsatisfactory having

regard to the test of spontaneity and contemporaneity. It is common

knowledge that, when complaints are not made promptly after an

incident, there is always room for false implication motivated by ill

will or on hearsay material. Therefore, in our view there is merit in

this argument advanced by learned Counsel that it would be

dangerous to act on the evidence of the complainant in view of the

long delay which has not been satisfactorily explained."

If there is sufficient explanation to the delay in making a statement, then

the mere belatedness of a witness in making an accusation will not for that

reason alone is susceptible to be rejected as an afterthought. In Paulin de Croos v

The Queen 71 NLR 169 and Bandaranaike v Jagathsena (1984) 2 Sri L.R. 397, this

approach was recognised. The position is clearly spelt out in the judgment of

Bandara v The State (2001) 2 Sri L.R. 63, as it was held that;

10

"If there is a valid reason or explanation for the delay and if the trial

Judge is satisfied with the reasons or explanation given, no trial

Judge would apply the Test of Spontaneity and Contemporaneity

and reject the testimony of a witness in such circumstances."

A similar view was expressed in Samarakoon v The Republic (2004) 2 Sri

L.R. 20, where Jayasuriya J observed thus;

"Just because the statement of a witness is belated the Court is not

entitled to reject such testimony. In applying the Test of

Spontaneity the Test of Contemporaneity and the Test of

Promptness the Court ought to scrupulously proceed to examine

the reasons for the delay. If the reasons for the delay adduced by

the witness are justifiable and probable the trial Judge is entitled to

act on the evidence of a witness who had made a belated

statement.

In considering the failure of the two injured to make the accusation against

the Appellant in the first available opportunity and thereafter taking an

unusually long period in making their accusation for the first time, this Court

must" scrupulously proceed to examine the reasons for the delay".

In fact, Rev Alexander said in evidence that due to his injury on the mouth

it was difficult for him to make a descriptive version of events, when the medical

officer inquired as to the incident. However, this claim is not supported by the

11

medical officer, who noted only a superficial cut near his mouth, which did not

offer any difficulty to the injured in speaking. On the other hand, even if he had

such a difficulty, it was easier for him to merely mention the Appellant's name as

the offender, rather than making a long statement that a known person had

caused the injuries.

It is evident that Rev Alexander is not familiar with the area while Pradeep

Kumara was being a resident of the area, who could be expected to know the

identity of the attacker. Although Rev Alexander said in his evidence that he

recognised the Appellant's voice when the death threat was uttered, during

cross-examination he admitted that the witness had not spoken to the Appellant.

Then a question arises, how is that he made the voice identification as he claims,

which the prosecution failed to clarify.

Whilst at the National Hospital, the two injured were placed on adjoining

beds, providing an opportunity for the two to compare notes as to the details of

the attack. Rev Alexander had the advantage of a 48 hour duration, awaiting to be

examined by the medical officer, since his admission to the Hospital in the same

evening to clearly remind himself of the incident. Pradeep Kumara also had 24

hours to recollect his thoughts and to make an accurate description of the

attacker.

However, none of them did that. They waited 25 days to come to the

Police. It is not clear as to what prompted Rev Alexander to come to Pannala

12

Police after more than three weeks. He was only treated at National Hospital for

two days. They made their statement one after the other and had the opportunity

of hearing what the other had stated to Police. Having had all these

opportunities to clearly comprehend and remind themselves of the details of the

attack, why is only Rev Alexander implicated the Appellant in his statement,

while Pradeep Kumara admitted in his cross-examination that he did not. Rev.

Alexander had no answer to the question put to him that he had implicated the

Appellant for the first time only in his statement to Police.

Testimony of witness Pradeep Kumara provides a clue to this disparity.

According to this witness, he did not make a statement to Police because his

Church did initiate action. He made his statement when Rev Alexander wanted

him to make one. He further admitted that he did not mention that they were

attacked by the Appellant even in that belated statement, although they had the

opportunity to discuss the manner in which they should make their statements.

No clarification was elicited by the prosecution during its re-examination. The

relevant question and answer are as follows;

" g: ~l~ ~Cl) CD) c:J)tll Cl)() ColCl)o l~~tll c:JeD qOO)QCl

tDCl@l?

13

The witness admitted that Akila was the first person to whom he disclosed

that it was the Appellant who attacked them. According to Rev Alexander,

witness Pradeep Kumara contacted Akila by phone and got his assistance for them

to be rushed to a nearby hospital. But the prosecution did not call Akila, although

he was listed as the 3rd prosecution witness, depriving the trial Court of an

opportunity of assessing the consistency of the version given by the witnesses.

It is therefore evident that none of the injured have implicated the

Appellant in the first available opportunity, having had a reasonable opportunity

to do so. Then they waited for 25 days for no justifiable reason to make a delayed

statement to Pannala Police. It appears that Pradeep Kumara made statement to

Police only upon being persuaded by Rev. Alexander, and on his own admission,

did not implicate the Appellant, even after 25 days since the incident.

Interestingly, when Rev Alexander was suggested by the Appellant during

his cross examination that the Appellant was falsely implicated, the witness

claimed that he saw him striking. The relevant question and answer are

reproduced below;

"g: @oiO.!!lJ t:l)().!!lClJ, t:l)JO ClS t:l)()1;()OQ) t:l)@~ .!!lz, ~

14

But, when questioned by Court, the witness almost conceded to the

Appellant's suggestion referred to above, by admitting that he "thought" it was

the Appellant who did it because of his prior acts of protest. Strangely, the Court

did not ask the witness why he implicated the Appellant. The Court, merely

wanted to clarify from the witness as to why would the Appellant mount such an

attack on them without any provocative act. But the witness, quite unwittingly,

made this important revelation. The relevant question by Court and the

witnesses' answer are reproduced below for clarity.

" g: CDJCl @oI@6o!ll ~oO 6\O.!Do!ll g\ilC).!D!; 6\B @!;oci o!lll61C) @

@ g~(3)(,90) Cl6.!Do!ll q l 61 6\0(,9)."

This answer clearly indicates that as far as this particular witness is

concerned, the Appellant was implicated in the attack simply on suspicion, and

not because he was necessarily seen and identified that evening but due to

"tutoring and concoction" by a third party. Perhaps, this is the reason as to why,

witness Pradeep Kumara, although he knew the Appellant as a fellow villager, did

not mention the Appellant's name to the examining doctor on the day of the

incident and even in making his statement after 25 days.

In the impugned judgment of the trial Court, it appears that the Court had

considered the evidence of the prosecution evidence only in one paragraph. In its

11 page Judgment the 1st to 8th pages were mere narration of the evidence. The

only paragraph which dealt with the prosecution case is found on page 9. The

15

said paragraph is consisting of four sentences. The relevant paragraph is

reproduced below;

The trial Court had accepted the prosecution versIOn simply on the

premise that the Appellant was known to the injured prior to the incident in that

one sentence. There was absolutely no analysis undertaken by the trial Court at

all for evaluating the testimonial trustworthiness of the prosecution witness for

their failure to name the Appellant in the first available opportunity and to make

their statements to Police only after 25 days. In doing so the trial Court had

abdicated its judicial duty as recognised in Samarakoon v The Republic (supra).

Learned High Court Judge who delivered the impugned judgment had no

opportunity of observing the demeanour and deportment of the two injured

persons, as he had succeeded his predecessor only at the stage of defence case. It

is therefore incumbent upon the learned trial Judge to properly evaluate the

evidence, taking extra care, while keeping in mind of the fact that he did not

16

have the advantage of observing the witnesses. However, since the trial Court

had acted on the transcript of the evidence for determining the truthfulness and

reliability of the evidence, this Court too is placed in the same position in

evaluation as the trial Court by examining the transcript of the evidence, since

the trial Court had no advantage of seeing the witnesses over this Court.

Certainly there is merit in the contention advanced by the learned

President's Counsel that the Appellant was falsely implicated owing to his prior

acts of protest for the religious activities conducted in the said prayer centre.

In view of these infirmities in the evidence of the two injured persons, this

Court entertains a reasonable doubt as to the truthfulness and reliability of the

version of events as related to by the two injured persons. This ground of appeal

therefore is entitle to succeed.

The other contention of the learned President's Counsel was that the trial

Court had shifted the burden of proof on the Appellant as it is stated in the

judgment that he had failed to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case.

It appears that this too is a valid contention as the words used by the trial

Court, in its judgment did in fact indicate adoption of such an approach in

considering the evidence. The relevant segment of the judgment is worded as

follows;

17

"~(5)0l Boo tll6lfl!! oGtllJ <>ll@@~~ OI~61~(9 ClB~ ~~BotD tll6lfl!!

The words "ot::)J6fl!l oltlloci G(6) !S\Oo ~~Ol G@OJ@(5)JOtD a G(6) <>lO"

indicate that the trial Court expected the Appellant to create a reasonable doubt

in the prosecution case. This mistaken notion is once more repeated by the trial

Court in its final sentence, eliminating any doubt as to the perception of the

burden of proof as entertained by the trial Court. When it used the words "~~Ol

G@OJ@(5)JOtD a G(6) <>lO" it is obvious that the trial Court expected the Appellant

to create a doubt in the prosecution case, by casting a positive obligation, rather

than the prosecution on its own proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. If the

trial Court had used the words "ot::)J6fl!l oltlloci q) g@o lIlIOl", instead of the

words "~~Ol G@OJ@(5)JOtD a G(6) <>lO" then, it is not possible interpret as to what

the trial Court had intended was that it is up to the accused to raise a reasonable

doubt in the prosecution case.

What the trial Court should have considered at the conclusion of the trial

is, after taking the evidence presented before the Court into its consideration as a

whole, it should proceed to decide the fundamental question whether the

prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt or not.

This Court therefore inclined to accept the submissions of the learned

President's Counsel that the trial Court had in fact shifted burden of proof on to

18

the Appellant by expecting him to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution

case.

Therefore, the conviction and sentence of the Appellant in respect of the

two attempted murder counts are set aside.

The appeal of the Appellant is accordingly allowed.
