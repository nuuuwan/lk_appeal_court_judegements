HON. JUSTICE ACHALA WENGAPPULI

This is an appeal lodged by the accused-appellant, in challenging his

conviction and the imposition of a sentence of seven-year imprisonment, coupled

with a fine and compensation payable to one Mahadurage Ranatunga, as imposed

by the High Court of Ratnapura by its judgment dated 09.05.2018, in case No.

284/2013, where he was found guilty of committing the offence of grave sexual

abuse on the said Mahadurage Ranatunga, a person under 16 years of age.

When this appeal was taken up for hearing on 13.01.2020 and 22.01.2020,

learned Counsel for the accused-appellant had relied on several grounds of

appeal in its support. Of these multiple grounds of appeal that had been raised

before this Court and the submissions in support of them, it is possible to

identify and to classify them under two general areas of dispute.

One such area would be the grounds of appeal which dealt with the

procedural and other errors made by the trial Court during the trial and in

2

determining the guilt or innocence of the accused-appellant. These included that

the trial Court had failed to explain the rights of the accused- appellant after it

had determined that he had a case to answer, the trial Court had compared

evidence of the prosecution witnesses with the contents of their statements made

to Police when it evaluated them for credibility and its failure to hold that the

prosecution had failed to prove that the offence was committed on the date as

alleged in the indictment.

The other general area, under the remaining grounds of appeal could be

grouped with, is the errors made by the trial Court in determining the

testimonial trustworthiness of the prosecution witnesses and the relative

probabilities of the version of events as relied upon by the prosecution in order

to prove its allegation levelled against the accused-appellant. In relation to this

area, the accused- appellant contended that the trial Court had failed to consider

the delay of the prosecution witness No.1 in making the initial complaint, a

factor which had adverse effect on his credibility and that the prosecution

witness No.3 is an interested and therefore an unreliable witness.

In support of the complaint that the trial Court had committed a

procedural error when it failed to explain the rights of the accused-appellant

when the trial Court ruled that he had a case to answer, the learned Counsel

relied on the judgments of Lionel v Republic of Sri Lanka 79 I NLR 553 and

Attorney General v Aponso 2008 [B.L.R] 145.

In view of the submissions made by the learned Counsel for the accused-

appellant on the errors of the trial Court on procedure, namely when it failed to

inform the accused-appellant's rights in calling for the defence and the erroneous

3

comparison of evidence of the lay prosecution witnesses with the contents of the

statements made by them during investigations, learned Senior State Counsel

confined his submission to the issue whether this Court should order a retrial or

not in the circumstances. He moved this Court to order a retrial since the

prosecution had established a prima facie case before the trial Court and the

infirmities that had been relied on by the accused-appellant are due to natural

limitations of the witness's capacity to narrate their version with clarity owing to

their underprivileged status in social and educational spheres.

In his submissions, the accused-appellant relied on the reasoning of the

judgments of King v Fernando 48 NLR 249, Peter Singho v Werapitiya 55 NLR

155 and Queen v Jayasinghe 69 NLR 314, where the issue of remitting a case to be

retried was considered by the Superior Courts and have decided against it,

owing to different reasons. He also submitted that the alleged date of offence is

December 2006, and the accused-appellant is now 67 years of age.

Delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in King v

Fernando (ibid), it was decided not to order a re-trial in that particular instance,

owing to the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence of the sole witness to the

incident, whose" .. . assailability will be increased by the passage of time" and therefore

" ... the chances of a conviction in the event of a fresh trial ... is remote."

In Wijepala v Attorney General (2001) 1 Sri L.R. 46, Fernando J had re-

iterated the duty of an appellate Court, whilst adopting the reasoning of the

judgment of Jagathsena and Others v G.D.D. Perera, Inspector, Criminal

Investigations Department and Mrs Bandaranaike (1992) 1 Sri L.R. 371, in

following terms;

4

U in a trial before a judge sitting alone, while his decision

on questions of fact based on the demeanour and credibility

of witnesses carry great weight, an appellate Court has a

duty to test the evidence by a careful and close scrutiny and if it entertains a strong doubt as to the guilt of the accused,

the Court must give the benefit of that doubt to him. U

Therefore, when this Court ventures to consider the submissions of the

learned Senior State Counsel in order to determine the issue whether a retrial

should be ordered or not, it must first test the evidence presented before the trial

Court by the prosecution by a careful and close scrutiny.

One of the primary concerns relied upon by the accused-appellant in

challenging the testimonial trustworthiness of the evidence presented by the

prosecution, is the alleged belatedness in making the allegation and the alleged

failure of the trial Court to consider that vital issue adequately.

The prosecution mainly relied on the evidence of Mahadurage Harsha

Ranatunga (PWl) in order to prove the alleged incident and relied also on his

mother Jayakodi Arachchilage Anoma (PW2) and a senior teacher of the school

Wanigamuni Chandrasena (PW3), where the accused-appellant served as its

principal, in support of the version of events as narrated by the virtual

complainant.

At the time the trial was commenced, the virtual complainant Harsha

Ranatunga was a 26-year-old mature adult with children although in his evidence

he related to an incident which took place when he was in grade 8. He studied in

the school which had adjoined to his house.

5

One day, although the school was closed due to a holiday, the accused-

appellant wanted Harsha to come over to his office to clean up a cupboard that

had been attacked by termites. When he entered the office, the accused-

appellant, after having locked the door, asked him to remove his clothes. The

accused-appellant, having laid Harsha on the office floor had thereafter,

performed an act of intercrural sex with him. After the act, Harsha was allowed to

go home.

It is stated by Harsha Ranatunga that he did not complain of this incident to

his mother immediately, but told his class teacher Nimal Chandrasena only on the

following day. Thereafter a formal complaint was lodged with the Child and

Women Protection Bureau at Balangoda. On 11.09.2007, after about 2 or 3 weeks

since the incident, a police officer who visited his home had recorded a statement.

During cross examination, it was elicited through Harsha Ranatunga that

whilst in Court and awaiting to be called into the witness box, Chandrasena (PW3)

had shown him a statement enabling him to refresh his memory as to the date of

the incident. The witness admitted that the formal complaint was lodged with

Child Development Officer of the Provincial Secretariat. After questioning, the

witness admitted his involvement in an incident where said Chandrasena's son's

pair of trousers was removed. The witness was suggested by the accused-

appellant, in order to drop charges for that incident, Chandrasena and another

teacher had induced him to make this false complaint. The witness gave an

evasive answer to that suggestion stating that he had left village no sooner he

stopped schooling in 2009 and never met Chandrasena before the case.

6

An inconsistency (VI) was marked off his evidence as he had stated to

Police that he was laid on a polythene sheet with flowery design, although in

evidence he stated that he was laid on bare cement floor of the office.

Witness Nimal Wijesinghe stated in his evidence that he had a recollection

being told of an incident of some sexual activity by the accused-appellant with

Harsha Ranatunga that had taken place during school vacation but he was told of

the incident only after the school was re-opened for the new term. In cross

examination he stated that he never functioned as the virtual complainant's class

teacher at any point of time.

The witness who was termed as an interested and therefore partisan

witness by the accused-appellant was Wanigamuni Chandrasena. He was called as

the 3rd prosecution witness.

He related an earlier incident as a starting point of the instant accusation.

His own child who studied in Grade 2 of the same school had complained to him

of removing his pair of trousers by another student. Sometime later, he came to

know that a mother had complained to Grama Niladahri that her son was sexually

abused and, being a humble villager, she is powerless to initiate legal action. The

witness then had summoned two students whose names that transpired. Harsha

was one of the two. He got the children to write down what happened to them

and then advised their mothers to lodge a complaint at the Child Protection Unit.

He was summoned by the officers of the Unit at a later point of time where he

explained his limited role of sending the complainants to the appropriate

Government agency for redress.

During cross examination, the witness admitted that he was the teacher

with the longest service record of the school where the virtual complainant

7

studied. He also stated that the accused-appellant was appointed as principal of

the school owing to his close relationship with the regional Director of Education,

although he expected the authorities to consider his qualifications for that proof.

As the appointment was made for different reasons he had to retire from

service with a teachers' salary. The witness also admitted that both himself and

the accused-appellant had to face an inquiry held over a loss of some lab

equipment, but he was later exonerated. The witness was asked to tender a

statement made by him ("Xl") which he claimed to be a rough sketch of what he

narrated to the Police, as he had it with him in the witness box at the time of

giving evidence. He had prepared it after returning from the Police. He further

stated that his child had typed his statement into a computer but at that time he

was studying in Grade 2. The witness was suggested that he had fabricated this

allegation owing to his resentment with the accused-appellant over the latter's

appointment as a principal, which he denied.

Witness Anoma stated that she saw her son going to the office and upon

return he complained of harassment "tll61;6 tll@." She did not complain about

this incident to the Garama Niladhari of the area. However, she admitted that it

was the school teachers who complained about this incident to authorities. She

was thereafter summoned by the Child Protection Authority and had her

statement recorded, followed by Balangoda Police.

In cross examination, the witness admitted that she was described of the

incident in detail by " C)di~@lc5<'ll 06" and then by another lady officer at the

authority.

The accused-appellant, in his statement from the dock denied the

allegation and claimed that the allegation is a fabrication of his former colleague.

8

When the evidence is considered in the perspective of the submissions

made by the accused-appellant, it appears that the details as to the initial

revelation of the incident is somewhat hazy. The indictment indicates that the

offence was committed between 01.12.2006 and 31.12.2006. Harsha said he did not

recall the exact date. It is his evidence that he did not tell his mother of the

incident but waited patiently to complain to his class teacher Nimal on the

following day. Nimal said he learnt the incident only when he returned to work

after school vacation indicating that the alleged incident if at all may have taken

place during school vacation.

The first official who recorded a statement from Harsha was the Grama

Niladhari and that was on 21.08.2007. He did so upon instructions of Child Rights

Development Officer. The Police recorded Harsha's statement on 11.09.2007 and

produced before him the District Medical Officer on 12.09.2007. The short history

indicated that the victim was used for a sexual act by an elderly male 10 months

ago.

In his examination in chief Harsha stated that the incident took place in a

school holiday and the following day he complained about it to "Nimal Sir". He

was emphatic that the Police recorded his statement 2 to 3 weeks after the

incident and his statement was recorded on 11.09.2007.

This effectively placed the date of incident in a date within the month of

August 2007, but the indictment was not amended.

The other aspect highlighted by the accused-appellant is the partiality of

the witness Chandrasena which the trial Court had failed to take note in

considering his evidence.

9

It is interesting to note how Chandrasena became involved with the case.

Chandrasena said he got to know from a third party that Anoma had expressed her

grief before Grama Niladhari over her helplessness and sought help to pursue the

incident. But Anoma said that she never complained about it to Grama Niladhari

and got to know the details of the incident only through Chandrasena. According

to Chandrasena when he learnt about the desperate plea made by Anoma he

summoned Harsha and made him to write down the details of the incident he

complained about. Harsha did not support this claim. The Defence Witness

Pricilla Fernando said it was Chandrasena who initially handed over a letter

prepared by "a villager", in addition to handing over of the written account of

the incident claimed to have been written by Harsha. After the Police recorded a

statement from Chandrasena, he prepared a rough sketch of his statement, typed

into a computer by his Grade two child. Then at the High Court, Chandrasena

made an attempt to remind Harsha of the date of incident.

The accused-appellant's claim of Chandrasena's conduct, being partial due

to his unusual interest in the whole exercise, seemed justified in these

circumstances. The Defence Witness Pricilla Fernando also stated the complaint

about Harsha's incident was conveyed to her office by Chandrasena when he

delivered a letter seemingly prepared by a "villager", which act indicated that he

had assumed a role in excess of being a mere facilitator to a helpless village

woman, whose child had been molested by the principal of the school. The letter

that had been tendered to Fernando, in support of the "villager's" petition,

claiming to be written by Harsha, was not produced and not verified by the

Prosecution during Harsha's evidence.

This Court is mindful and concerned of the trend of general reluctance

shown by members of our society in reporting crime, unless they themselves 10

become victims, and the good samaritanism of the citizenry is fast reaching its

vanishing point. Therefore, the observations that are made in the particular

circumstances of this appeal should not be construed as an indication of

insensitivity of the Courts in recognising someone who acted in fulfilment of his

social and civic duty.

At the same time, this Court is duty bound to consider the validity of the

complaint of the accused-appellant that he was a victim of a fabricated version of

events in the hands of an interested party purely due to professional jealousy.

In this particular incident, however, when the conduct of Chandrasena is

examined against the backdrop of all the circumstances, it must be observed that

there are traits of some personal interest piercing the veneer of the claimed

fulfilment of one's social responsibility. His role had transformed itself from the

initial status of a facilitator to a one of instigator. The obvious challenge to the

bona fides of this witness emanates from his own conduct of coming out with a

version of events that are not supported by either Harsha or his mother Anoma.

They attribute a more active role on the witness than the one he made an attempt

to portray. Although, his over enthusiasm shown in bringing the incident to the

attention of authorities could be understood, but when viewed in the light of

certain inbuilt improbabilities of his version unfortunately leaves a long shadow

of doubt as to his bona fides .

Returning to the evidence of Harsha, this Court already noted that his

evidence is not in line with the time period specified in the indictment and either

due to long time that had elapsed since the alleged incident or due to his

limitations in expressing himself. It is also noted that his evidence lacked detail,

in relation to the circumstances surrounding the incident. This Court had

11

considered the judgments of Dayaratne v The Attorney General (CA 188/2015) -

decided on 22.09.2017 and Dharmadasa v The Attorney General (CA 201/2011)

where this Court had placed emphasis in establishing the date and time specified

in the indictment by the prosecution.

It could well be that Chandrasena's involvement in the complaint had

resulted in the uncertainty of the evidence of the prosecution as a whole, which is

in fact based on an actual incident. However, in applying the test, as employed by

their Lordships in King v Fernando (supra), to the evidence available in the

instant appeal, this Court is unable to answer the question affirmatively whether

it would serve any purpose to the prosecution by remitting this case to be re-

tried, in view of the infirmities that already exists in its case.

Therefore, the appeal of the accused-appellant is allowed by setting aside

the conviction and sentence imposed by the High Court of Ratnapura by its

judgment dated 09.05.2018.
