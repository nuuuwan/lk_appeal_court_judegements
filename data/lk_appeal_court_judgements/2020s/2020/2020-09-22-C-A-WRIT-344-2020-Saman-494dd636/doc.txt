Riad Ameen with PratheepaBalendran for the

Petitioner.

18.09.2020

These applications (CA Writ 344/20 and CA Writ 345/20) are made in respect of a

Director of a company called Rank Entertainment Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. It is contended

that the Petitioner is being summoned to appear before the learned Chief Magistrate of

Colombo subsequent to the issuance of summons in Magistrate's Court Case bearing

Nos. 40507/8/20 and 40509/8/20.

A cogent submission is made by the learned President's Counsel Mr. Riad Ameen that a

wrong person has been summoned before Court when in fact it is the company, Rank

Entertainment Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. which is liable to be summoned as a defaulter in

terms of Section 8 (1) of the Finance Act No. 10 of 2015. The argument is made that in

terms of this Finance Act No. 10 of 2015, it is the company called Rank Entertainment

Holdings (Pvt) Ltd. that becomes liable and not the Director who has been summoned

by way of the summons in the two cases. In a series of judgments such as MED. Silva

v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue 53 NLR page 280, Ranjith Wijemanne v.

Commissioner of Income Tax (1951) Vol. I Ceylon Tax Cases 496, Rajan Philip v.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1982) Vol. IV Reports of Sri Lanka Tax Cases 211,

Ramalin v. Commissioner Inland Revenue (1988) 2 SLR 259, Hamza v.

Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1991) Vol. IV Reports of Sri Lanka Tax Cases 301

and Dias v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (2011) 2 SLR I5.It has been

authoritatively held the person summoned should be the defaulter.

In these cases, Mr. Riad Ameen learned Counsel who appears for the Petitioner

strenuously argues that the Petitioner does not become liable for the tax in dispute.

Having listened to this argument we advert our attention to the case of Conunissioner

2

,.

General of Inland Revenue v. Kaggala Garments limited (Court of Appeal minutes

of 05.04.2017) - in Case bearing No. CA Application TaxlO1/2008, where two Judges of

this Court conclusively decided that any objection to jurisdiction must be taken before

the tribunal which is seized of the matter in the first instance. This Court cited Wade

and Forsyth Administrative Law nth Edition 2014 where it is stated as follows.

"Where a jurisdictional question is disputed before a tribunal, tile tribunal must necessarily

decide it. If it refuses to do so, it is wrongfully decliningjurisdiction and the Court will order it

to act properly."

In the circumstances, we direct that this jurisdictional bar must be first taken before

the learned Magistrate before whom this matter is due to corne up for a cause to be

shown on 21.09.2020. It is proper that the learned Magistrate should address this

question of jurisdiction in the first instance and make his order thereon. Therefore,

until the Magistrate makes his order on the jurisdiction, we would decline jurisdiction

and in view of this order, the Petitioner states that he would be vvithdrawing these

applications, but with the reservation that he would have recourse to this Court on the

jurisdictional question once the learned Magistrate has made its ruling.

All these jurisdictional questions focus on the same issue namely, Directors are not

liable for the tax in dispute of a company for which only the company is liable to show

cause as a defaulter.

I agree.
