ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

This is an appeal, by which the accused-claimant-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the" Appellant") seeks to challenge the validity of an order of the

High Court of Colombo in case No. HC 1799/04 delivered on 14.06.2011, in

relation to the refusal of his application, made under Section 425 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

The Appellant was indicted before the High Court for possession and

trafficking in of 742.3 grams of Heroin. In the indictment that had been presented

against him, the prosecution had listed bank notes to the value of Rs.

4,222,076.00, as its 5th item of production. The trial of the Appellant commenced

on 10.11.2004. The Appellant had absconded his trial half way through his case

and was since tried in absantia.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Appellant was acquitted on both counts

by the High Court by its judgment dated 28.07.2010, which was pronounced in

his absence.

On 11.03.2011, the Appellant made an application to the High Court

requesting it to release the said 5th item of production to him. The High Court

had conducted an inquiry into the application of the Appellant. The Appellant

and the prosecution made oral and written submissions and the Court had

delivered the impugned order confiscating the 5th item of production to the State. 2

In support of the Appellant's appeal against the said order of confiscation,

learned President's Counsel contended that the item of production could not be

treated as proceeds of any crime since the prosecution never alleged during its

evidence that the said amount of money that had been recovered from the

possession of the Appellant at the time of his arrest was used for the commission

of any offence. There was no one else other than the Appellant who claimed

ownership to the said item of production before the High Court. Therefore, the

Appellant claimed that the findings of the trial Court that the said amount of

money could not have been earned by the Appellant through reasonable means,

and that the Appellant did not challenge the judgment of acquittal, are clearly

erroneous conclusions reached by the High Court which made the said order an

illegal one.

It was also the contention of the learned President's Counsel that in the

absence of;

a. any conflicting claim by a third party,

b. any material to conclude that the "any offence appears to have been

committed" or, that the said item of production "has been used for the

commission of any offence";

that the High Court was wrong to have acted under Section 425 of the Code and

proceeded to confiscate the said item of production. He also made submissions

which was in support of his position that the judgments of Jayagoda & Another

v Attorney General (2006) 2 Sri L.R. 387 and Meegahapola v Officer in Charge,

3

Harbour Police, Colombo & Another (1992) 1 Sri L.R. 58 have no application to

the instant appeal since they could be distinguished.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General, in defending the impugned order of the

High Court, submitted that it was made upon the available material in the

absence of an application to have a viva voce inquiry. He contended that the

material available was more than sufficient for the High Court to conclude that

they satisfy the statutory requirement imposed by the Section 425, where it is

stated the Court "may make such order it thinks fit" if "any offence appears to have

been committed" in relation to the said amount of cash. He referred to the evidence

presented by the prosecution where it was stated by the officers of the Police

Narcotics Bureau, who raided the residence where the Appellant was residing

with several others. It is their evidence that some of the bundles of bank notes

that were recovered from the possession of the Appellant at the time of detection

of Heroin, were found scattered on the bed while they also found several more

bundles of bank notes that had been stacked inside a black bag, in which Heroin

was detected.

The High Court, in the impugned order primarily acted on the principles

that had been enunciated in the judgment of Jayagoda & Another v Attorney

General (supra) since there was no contest among the parties that the applicable

statutory provisions in relation to the Appellant's application are found in

Section 425 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. Not only the

High Court had considered the evidence of the Appellant during his trial where

he sought to offer an explanation to the trial Court over his possession of large

4

amount of bank notes, but it had also considered the judgment of the trial Court,

where the Appellant's explanation was considered and rejected.

In the said order, the High Court also acted on the reasoning contained in

the judgment of this Court in Meegahapola v Officer in Charge, Harbour Police,

Colombo & Another (supra) in rejecting the Appellant's application.

Thus, it is incumbent upon this Court to consider the validity of the

Appellant's challenge on the legality of the order of confiscation made by the

High Court in the light of the legal principles enunciated in the said judgments, if

they are applicable to the determination of the instant appeal.

The submissions of the learned President's Counsel that the statutory

provisions contained in Section 425 have no relevance to his application to the

High Court must be considered by this Court at the outset.

The said contention was made in the context that there was no allegation

of commission of an offence in relation to the amount of money and there was no

allegation that the money was used to commit an offence by the Appellant.

5

Section 425 of the Code consists of four subsections. Section 425(1) seems

to spelt out the general scope of the applicability of the Section in general. The

sub section states;

"When an inquiry or trial in any criminal Court is concluded the

Court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal of any

document or other property produced before it regarding which any

offence appears to have been committed or which has been used for

the commission of any offence."

Upon plain reading of the said subsection it is clear that with the insertion

of the said sub section, the Legislature had sought to deal with two situations.

Said subsection is meant to apply where it appears to a criminal Court that any

document or other property produced before it in any inquiry or trial "regarding

which any offence appears to have been committed or which has been used for the

commission of any offence" it must then make" such order as it thinks fit".

In the instant appeal, the bank notes that were in the possession of the

Appellant were produced as an item of productions by listing it in the

indictment. The Appellant was indicted for possession and trafficking in of more

than 700 grams of Heroin.

The definition provided by the Legislature to the offence of trafficking in of

a dangerous drug, as per the Section 54A of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance (as amended), is "to sell, give, procure, store, administer, transport,

6

send, deliver or distribute". The said definition to the offence of trafficking in of a

dangerous drug envisage situations where involvement of monetary transactions

in the commission of the offence of trafficking. In this respect, possession of a

large amount of bank notes along with a quantity of Heroin, which had a gross

weight of almost two kilograms clearly satisfies the statutory requirement

imposed by Section 425(1) where it states "regarding which any offence appears to

have been committed or which has been used for the commission of any offence". The

required degree of proof is specified as "it appears" to Court. Therefore, the

contention that the provisions of Section 425 have no application to the

production item that had been listed as such by the prosecution necessarily fails.

Moving on to consider the second aspect of the learned President's

Counsel's contention in which he contended that since there was no conflicting

claim on the production item by any party other than the Appellant and there

was no material before the High Court to conclude that the "any offence appears to

have been committed" or, that the said item of production "has been used for the

commission of any offence", this Court is of the view that the said contention

should be examined for its validity in the light of the statutory provisions

contained in Section 425(4), in addition to 425(1). This is due to the fact that the

contested item of production, not being a "document", should then be

considered as "property" as per the provisions of Section 425(1).

Section 425(4) not only provides a definition to the term "property" but

also provides an explanation as to the circumstances under which some

"property" could be included in to the scope of Section 425(1).

7

The Section 425(4) reads as follows;

"In this section the term "property" includes in the case of property

regarding which an offence appears to have been committed not

only such property as has been originally in the possession or under

the control of any party but also any property into or for which the

same may have been converted or exchanged and anything acquired

by such conversion or exchange whether immediately or otherwise."

Clearly, the said sub section has included not only the "property" that was

in the possession or control of the claimant, but also extends to "any property into

or for which the same may have been converted or exchanged and anything acquired by

such conversion or exchange whether immediately or otherwise" by bringing them

under the scope of Section 425(1).

The Appellant gave evidence before the trial Court. It was his position that

he had withdrawn about three million rupees from several bank accounts a few

days before he was arrested. The monies were to be invested in a business

venture in partnership with his brother-in-law and these funds meant to be his

share of the said business venture.

However, in his statement to the PNB, the Appellant stated that the cash

that had been recovered from his possession was derived from his Heroin sales

and at the time of detection, he was in the process of counting it when the officers

have raised his house. He did not know the exact amount of cash he had in his

8

possession at the time of his arrest. In Joseph v Attorney General 47 NLR 446, it

was stated that the opinion of Court as to the ownership of the property may be

based on a confession made by the accused since Section 24 of the Evidence

Ordinance which makes confessions 'irrelevant in criminal proceedings' does not

prevent a Court from acting on them in an application under Section 425.

Returning to the legal submissions of the Appellant, the fact in issue before

the High Court was whether "any offence appears to have been committed or

which has been used for the commission of any offence" in relation to the item of

production. The High Court had guided itself with the reasoning of the judgment

in Jayagoda & Another v Attorney General (supra) in arriving at a finding not in

favour of the Appellant.

In the said judgment, where an order of confiscation made under Section

425 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 is challenged, invoking

revisionary jurisdiction of this Court, it was held that;

"There is no rule that the property should be returned to the person

from whom it was taken when the Court finds that an offence

appears to have been committed in respect of the property. The

Court is entrusted to make such order as it thinks fit. If the Court is

bound to return the property to the person from whom it was taken

from knowing that it did not belong to him and that no evidence

had been led to prove that the claimant is entitled to it, it would not

be a fit order."

9

The Appellant sought to distinguish the judgment of Jayagoda & Another

v Attorney General (supra) from the facts of the instant appeal. This Court is of

the view that the said judgment had dealt with the identical issue that had been

presented by the Appellant in the instant appeal and therefore is of very strong

persuasive value. The only difference is this is an appeal whereas the judgment

of Jayagoda & Another v Attorney General (supra) is in relation to an application

for revision. It is evident from the said judgment as to the nature of the case

presented by the Petitioner, which is identical with the position advanced by the

Appellant before this Court. Their Lordships stated;

"There is no dispu te that the accused made admissions to the police

that the money formed part of the charge. Nowhere did the

petitioners make a claim to this money other than through this

motion in the High Court at the conclusion of the trial. The

submission of the learned counsel is that the money should be

returned to the petitioners as the police took this money from them."

Their Lordships, in delivering the judgment of Jayagoda & Another v

Attorney General (supra) have considered the scope of the Sections 425(1) and

425(4) extensively as well as the relevant authoritative judicial precedents on that

point. This Court respectfully agrees with the reasoning of their Lordships'

judgment as a judicial precedent which had laid down the legal principles that

are applicable in an application under Section 425.

This Court already noted the evidence presented by the prosecution in

relation to the circumstances under which the officers have taken charge of the

10

large amount of bank notes from the possession of the Appellant. The trial Court,

although acquitted the Appellant by its judgment, had nonetheless disbelieved

the explanation offered by him as to the presence of the large amount of bank

notes. The contention that the High Court, in its judgment had observed that the

said amount of money was not earned by the Appellant by "reasonable business

activity" (c.:))G))()fl!) CllS)O)() Cl@.05 GOO) GloSoSo) which is not the applicable criterion

as envisage by Section 425, cannot be accepted since the High Court, in its

impugned order and in rejecting his application clearly concluded that the

Appellant had earned the said amount of money through criminal activity

(O)O())Q QiO) Cl@.05). Clearly the High Court had applied the correct legal criterion

in making the impugned order.

Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that the appeal of the

Appellant is devoid of any merit.

Accordingly, this Court affirms the order of the High Court dated

14.06.2011 and dismisses his appeal.
