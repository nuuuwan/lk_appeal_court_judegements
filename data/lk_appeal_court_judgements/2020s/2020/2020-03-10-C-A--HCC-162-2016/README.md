DEVIKA ABEYRATNE. J

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of

Anuradhapura for having committed the murder of Seelaratnage Mallika

Padmini, and was convicted and sentenced to death.

Aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the accused

appellant appealed, raising several grounds of appeal that the learned

High Court judge; had not evaluated the contradictions in the evidence

of the prosecution witness; had not considered the submissions made by

the Defense; had not considered the weaknesses in the prosecution

witnesses and that the judgment is contrary to the evidence placed

before court.

However, at the appeal it was contended by the counsel for the

appellant that the learned High Court Judge has not considered the

defense of cumulative provocation despite the overwhelming evidence

that the deceased and the appellant were constantly quarrelling with

each other.

The counsel has cited the decisions in Premlal Vs Attorney

General [2002J 2 Sri LR 403, King Vs Albert Appuhamy 41 NLR 505 and

King Vs Bellona Vidanelage Eddin 41 NLR 345, to substantiate her

2

argument that even if there is failure on the part of the defense to take

up a certain line of defense, it was the responsibility of the trial judge to

consider a factual situation which would result in culpable homicide not

amounting to murder in the evidence on record.

I will consider the grounds of appeal adverted to in the petition of

appeal as well as the position taken up at the hearing of the appeal.

The cause of death of the deceased Seelaratnage Mallika Padmini

is burn injuries caused from fire. The case for the prosecution can be

summarized as follows; the deceased and the appellant were living

together as husband and wife and the deceased had been earlier

married to one Gamini Wickramasinghe, a step brother of the appellant,

from which marriage she has two daughters, PW 2 Priyanka Nilmini

Wickramasinghe and the other daughter was living abroad at the time

of the incident.

Several Prosecution witnesses have testified that the deceased

told them that Kirimahathmaya the appellant has set fire to her.

Priyanka PW 2, was living with the mother and the appellant whom she

addressed as 8appa. On the day of the incident 25.03.2005, around 8.30

and 9.00 in the morning she has gone to the Udamaluwa, with the

neighbors, Nishantha mama, his wife and child. Later in the morning,

through Nishantha she was informed that the mother has been brought

to the Anuradhapura hospital, where, around noon, she saw her mother

on a hospital trolley with burn injuries . Thereafter, she has visited her

mother in hospital only on 29.03.2005, the day her mother died, when

after the afternoon visiting hour, she was told by the mother, that when

she was going through some receipts with the help of a kerosene lamp,

the Appellant poured petrol on her and set fire to her.

She has testified that the mother and the appellant used to fight

and argue with each other often, mostly when he was under the

influence of liquor.

It was also in evidence that when he was not drunk, they still

argued about the earlier incidents. It was revealed that there was an

3

argument on the previous night of the incident over some Paddy and

that it subsided after the appellant went to sleep ( Page 97 of the Brief).

She has testified that when she left the house around 8.30 and

9.00 in the morning the mother and the appellant were in the house

and there was no fighting at that time, later saw the mother with burn

injuries. Thus, it is apparent that within about three hours after PW 2 left

the house the incident occurred and her mother was in hospital.

Under the persistent cross examination of the defence counsel the

witness has clearly evidenced in page 113 of the brief that the mother

stated that it was Kirimahaththaya the appellant who threw petrol on

her.

PW 4 Leelawathie who is a neighbor as well as a relative who lives

about 15 meters from the house of the deceased has testified that in the

morning of the incident she has heard cries of a woman and thinking

that it was from her immediate next door neighbor Indra Kumari, she

has run to the adjoining house, when Indra Kumari told her that It was

Mallika who was shouting saying she has been set fire to. PW 4 has gone

to Mal/ika's house with her husband, where she has seen Mal/ika naked

with burn injuries and was told that Kirimahathmaya ( appellant) threw

petrol and burnt her. She has stated that she did not know the motive

4

for the incident but she often heard the couple constantly fighting and

shouting. Her husband has accompanied the injured to hospital.

PW 1, Dinesh Lakshman Kumara has taken the injured Mallika to

the hospital around 11.15 11.30 on the 25th He has testified that he

was told by the injured that Kirimahathmaya set fire to her.

H. M. Senarath PW 14 , a step brother of the appellant has given

evidence to the effect that on the day of the incident around 10 and 11

in the morning the appellant came to the paddy field to give him his rice

meal and uttered the following (in page 242 of the brief)

The following morning he has been informed that Mallika has

suffered burn injuries from petrol being thrown on her.

PW 5, Thushara Nilmini who with her husband runs a boutique

where she sells petrol among other commodities ,who knows the

appellant as a person from the village as well as one of her customers,

has testified that the appellant has purchased petrol from her boutique

around 10 and 11 am on the morning of the incident and within about

half an hour to an hour, heard that petrol has been thrown on Mallika

and she has suffered burn injuries.

The mother of the deceased Somawathie PW 12 who was living in

Bulathkohupitiya with her son, after being informed about the daughter

getting injured has come on the 25th itself and has been with Mallika

5

until the 29th also has testified that Mallika told her that she was set fire

to by the appellant.

PW 7, IP Thilakaratne who visited the scene of crime has taken in

to custody a portion of a polythene bag tied to a coir and burnt items of

clothing.

From the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and the JMO's

evidence it is established that although the victim had severe burn

injuries, she had the ability to speak. On the 29th of March, the day she

died ,she had even advised PW 2 to keep the small stool under the bed

safely, stating if not she will have to stand and wait till morning, which

showed her rational thinking.

Some contradictions and omissions have been marked in the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses and the counsel for the appellant

has submitted that the learned trial judge has failed to evaluate same.

In the evidence of PW 2, the fact that PW 2 has not mentioned

that the receipts the deceased was going through were pertaining to

'C;:ows' was highlighted as an omission (page I09);The witness's failure

to state that the mother and the appellant had an argument on the eve

of the incident in her statement to the police or at the magisterial

inquiry has been highlighted as an omission; the witness's police

statement referring that she went to see her mother on the 28th when

in evidence she has stated it was the 29th has been marked as VI

contrad iction.

In PW 4 Leelawathie's evidence, contradiction VI is based on her

statement that Indra Kumari's house is situated on the other side of the

road when in evidence, she has stated that Indra Kumari lives adjoining

her house. Contradiction V2 is on the basis that in the police statement

it is recorded that she has stated that she was told by Mallika that

6

kerosene oil was used to set fire, when in evidence she has stated it was

petrol.

In re-examination she has explained why she referred to Ma/lika

being burnt with petrol and kerosene oil in the following manner.

I do not see any material contradictions in the testimony of either

PW2 or PW 4, as the witnesses have sufficiently explained the basis for

the omissions and contradictions. One omission of PW 2 is the failure to

state that the deceased and the appellant argued the previous evening.

From the evidence it appears the mother and the appellant fighting

seem to be an everyday occurrence and she has forgotten whether she

informed it or not. Contradiction V 1 is with regard to the date PW 2

visited her mother in hospital. These are omissions and contradictions

which are not material which has not affected the root of the case.

The fact that PW 2 not mentioning the receipts regarding the

vaccinations for the cows in my opinion is also not a material fact, what

is important and relevant is that the kerosene lamp was used to read

any document as that particular room was dark and it needed light for

anyone to read anything as corroborated by the police witness, PW 7

who has inspected the scene.

Where the evidence of PW 4 is concerned, her reference to

kerosene oil is in the context of the lamp that was being used by the

deceased, and the pouring of petrol was what ignited the fire that burnt

Mallika , and likewise in the statement, her describing that Indra

Kumari's house is on the other side of the road has not affected the

7

credibility of the witness as these contradictions are not material

contradictions.

With regard to the evidence of PW1, an omission was highlighted

that in his statement he has not stated that he was told by MaJ/ika that

the appellant threw petrol on her. An explanation was given that he

was only asked to make a statement that he is the one who admitted

the patient.

Contradiction VS was marked from the evidence of PW 14, that in

the statement to the police the witness has said that Kirimahathmaya

was after liquor, which in evidence he denied.

On a perusal of the judgment it is seen that the learned trial judge

has considered all the contradictions and omissions that were

highlighted and decided that they are minor contradictions that can

occur with passing of time and that they have not affected the root of

the matter, which sentiments this Court agree.

In his Dock Statement the appellant has stated that he is innocent

and that there was an argument the previous evening and as the

deceased was saying various things the following day also, and thinking

that a fight may ensue if he stays, he has left the house. Usually he goes

to the village and returns in the evening, and on this day when he was

getting ready to return in the evening, he had heard that the victim had

got burned and others have advised him not to go that he may be

accused and he sent his mother to the hospital and that as he was

threatened, he surrendered himself to the police.

The learned trial judge after considering the dock statement and

the relevant authorities on a plea of alibi, has given plausible reasons

why he is not accepting the dock statement.

On appeal, it was submitted on behalf of the accused that the

dock statement cannot be rejected in toto, as it was corroborated by

8

the evidence of the prosecution witness that the appellant and

deceased were fighting constantly and that the learned trial judge has

not given due consideration to that fact.

At the trial it was the position of the accused appellant that he

was not present at the scene of the incident. Only at the appeal stage a

new argument was brought up on the basis of cumulative provocation.

The learned State Counsel argued that cumulative provocation

cannot be considered as per the evidence of the daughter PW 2, as

there was a cooling off period after the incident the previous afternoon

and when PW 2 left the house in the morning they were not fighting.

The evidence of PW 2 in page 116 of the brief is reproduced to

get an understanding how the constant quarrelling was accepted as a

way of life by the witness, which fact may be difficult to comprehend

for some others.

The evidence of PW 14 the step brother and PW 5 Thushara

Nilmini is of importance when considering the submission of the

counsel for the appellant. According to PW 14 the appellant around 9

and 10 in the morning has made an utterance to the effect he was going

to kill her ( Mallika) , and PW 5 has testified that the appellant

purchased petrol from her boutique around 9 and 10 in the morning,

which evidence remain unchallenged. It is unclear from the dock

statement what time the appellant is alleged to have left the village.

The appellant has not offered any explanation with regard to this

evidence of the prosecution that he was seen in the morning of the

incident although in the dock statement he has stated that he left the

village with no specific time frame given.

The testimonies of the prosecution witnesses is that the deceased

informed them that it was Kirimahathmaya who set fire to her using

petrol. The way the pouring of petrol that ignited the kerosene oil lamp

that Mallika was using to read the receipts have been adequately

explained. This has been corroborated by the evidence of the JMO, who

has testified that the burns would not have been caused by a fire of a

kerosene oil lamp falling over the body ,but it was more probable that

some fuel was poured on the body whilst in a seating position and

getting ignited according to the burn injuries that are present.

The reference in the dying declarations is closely related to the

actual occurrence and it is directly related to the death of the deceased.

The appellant has not offered any explanation with regard to the strong

incriminating evidence led against him.

It is trite law that when a case depends on circumstantial

evidence, the inference of guilt can be justified only when all the

incriminating facts and circumstances are found to be incompatible with

the innocence of the accused.

10

There are no eye witnesses to the incident therefore the

prosecution relied on the circumstantial evidence to submit evidence

before court that the deceased died due to the action of the appellant.

In Don Sunny vs Attorney General [1998J 2 Sri. L R 1 it was held 'where a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence. On a consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only ......... if upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the offence then they can be found guilty"

The totality of the evidence led in this case lead to an inescapable

and irresistible inference and conclusion that it was the appellant who

has inflicted the injuries on the deceased which caused her death.

The prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt

and we see no reason to interfere with the learned trial judge's

conclusion. The conviction and the sentence of the learned High Court

Judge is affirmed.

Appeal is dismissed.
