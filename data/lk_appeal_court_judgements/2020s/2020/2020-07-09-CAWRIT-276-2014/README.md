Argued on: 17.06.2020

Decided on: 09.07.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The issue in this case is simple and straightforward. The land

relevant to this application was acquired under the Land

Acquisition Act. After the inquiry held under section 9 of the

Act, the 2nd Respondent Divisional Secretary made the decision

under section 17 of the Act to pay compensation in a sum of Rs.

13,995,500 to the Petitioner. Vide P13 dated 26.10.2010. So

far, the said compensation has not been paid. The Petitioner

filed this application seeking a writ of mandamus compelling the

1st Respondent District Secretary and/or the 2nd Respondent to

pay to the Petitioner the said compensation with interest.

What do the 1st and/or 2nd Respondents say in their defence?

They say acquisition was done on behalf of the 4th Respondent

Sri Lanka Ports Authority, and, as the said Authority has failed

to deposit the compensation money with the 1st and/or 2nd

Respondents, they are unable to pay compensation to the

Petitioner.

5

What does the 4th Respondent say in turn? Compensation was

predominantly decided on the valuation of the land by the

Government Chief Valuer. The 4th Respondents main

contentions are the valuation by the Government Chief Valuer is

excessively high, the findings/observations of the Presidential

Investigation Unit highlight the suspicious nature of the

valuations, and the Petitioners claim to ownership of the land is

dubious or uncertain. Defences of this nature are totally

irrelevant in deciding the straightforward case presented by the

Petitioner. The matters raised by the 4th Respondent shall be

sorted out by the 4th Respondent with the Chief Valuer and the

1st and/or 2nd Respondents. The Petitioner cannot and shall not

be made to suffer for disputes among other parties. The 4th

Respondents defence is absolutely devoid of merit.

Moreover, no relief has been sought against the 4th Respondent

because the land was acquired by the subject Minister and the

award under section 17 of the Act was made by the Divisional

Secretary. The Petitioner has nothing to do with the 4th

Respondent.

Once the award under section 17 is made, section 29 becomes

operative. According to section 29, the acquiring officer, in this

case the 2nd Respondent, shall pay the compensation awarded

under section 17 to the relevant claimants, subject to a final

decision by way of appeal to the Board of Review or the Court of

Appeal. There has been no such appeal in this case.

It is well settled law that mandamus lies to compel a statutory

duty, which the Petitioner in this application has a legal right to

demand.

I grant the reliefs to the Petitioner as prayed for in paragraphs

(b)-(d) of the prayer to the petition.

The application is allowed with costs.
