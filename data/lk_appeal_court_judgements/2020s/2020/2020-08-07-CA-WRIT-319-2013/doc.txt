ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Petitioner Company, Kega/le Plantations PLC, has invoked the

jurisdiction of this Court conferred under Article 140 of the Constitution,

seeking Writ of Certiorari, in quashing the decision of the 3rd Respondent

to acquire 8.050 Hectares of land from the 'Newlands Division' of

Ambadeniya Estate or "Newlandwatta" and the Notice published by the 1st

Respondent, under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, marked as PI0.

The Petitioner Company also seeks a Writ of Certiorari, in quashing the

decision made by the 3rd Respondent in terms of Section 5 of the said Act

and published in the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1794/6 dated 21.01.2013,

marked as P12.

It is stated that the Petitioner Company is the lessee of Janatha

Estates Development Board (JEDB), which owned and managed

Ambadeniya Estate, before it took over "the functions and carryon the

business" of the said Estate, under Section 3(2) of Public Companies Act

No. 23 of 1987, after an Order published in the Gazette Extraordinary No.

720/2 dated 22.06.1992. The JEDB then entered into a Memorandum of

Record and also executed irrevocable Power of Attorney No. 636 dated

16.08.1995. Thereafter the JEDB executed Indenture of Lease No. 739 dated

18.03.1998, by which it had leased out the said estate to the Petitioner

Company until 21.06.2045. The Petitioner Company therefore claims that it

is in "lawful possession" of the said Estate.

The Petitioner Company then developed the said Estate by spending

large sums of money on the rubber plantation given the commercial

4

viability of the Company would depend on the projected income from the

said Estate.

On 24.02.1999, the Petitioner Company received Notice, issued

under Section 2 of the Land Acquisition Act, in respect of a land in extent

of about 20 acres from the said Estate (P9) and on 11.06.2001, it received

Notice issued under Section 4 of the said Act, indicating a total of 8.050

another Hectares, to be acquired for a public purpose from the said Estate

(P10).

In response to the said Notice P10, the Petitioner Company objected

to the proposed acquisition, by a letter dated 27.06.2001 (P11), setting out

in detail the grounds upon which it had objected on and expected said

objections to be considered. In anticipation of an inquiry, the Petitioner

Company had in its possession of all material documents to establish the

validity of its grounds of objection. However, the Petitioner Company

claims that no inquiry into its objections was held and since "no further

steps were taken in respect of the said proposed acquisition", the

Company believed that "intended acquisition has been abandoned" and

continued to develop the said portion of land and enjoy its lease holding

rights.

In February 2013, the Petitioner Company was served with a copy of

the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1794/60f 21.01.2013 by which the 3rd

Respondent has made a decision and/ or declaration under Section 5(1) of

the Land Acquisition Act to acquire the said specified extent of land from

the said Estate, for the public purpose of "village expansion".

5

It is under these circumstances, learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner Company claims that the " ... purported decision by the 3rd

Respondent to acquire the said portion of land from the 'Newlands

Division' of the said Estate ... has been arrived at after twelve (12) years

and six (6) months after the Section 4 Notice (PI0) was issued and without

holding an inquiry and/ or affording an opportunity to the Petitioner to

substantiate its objections taken against the said Section 4 Notice" and,

therefore is "unlawful, arbitrary, mala fide and unreasonable."

The 1st to 4th Respondents, in their objections and in replying to the

claim of the Petitioner Company objecting to the proposed acquisition

stated that no objections "are available in the relevant files of the

Respondent."

At the hearing, learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General has

challenged the standing of the Petitioner Company to come before this

Court claiming relief, by contending that its rights are limited to the rights

that are specified in the said Indenture of Lease, and in their failure to

name JEDB, who actually owned the land, a necessary party, no relief is

obtainable. In addition, the Respondents also contend that the process of

holding an inquiry with regard to land acquisition is set out in Sections 7,

8, 9 and 10 of the Land Acquisition Act and the Petitioner Company did

not allege that such a process did not take place.

In support of their contention that the Petitioner Company had no

standing, learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General relied on the judgments

of this Court in CA 228/2012 Writ - decided on 14.06.2016, where it was

noted that the Petitioner in that application is a lessee of the 3rct

6

Respondent and " ... has no any statutory right to possess the land and

therefore he cannot seek judicial review." The special leave to appeal

application No. SC/SPL/LA/141/2016, challenging the said decision, was

dismissed by the Supreme Court on 28.03.2018.

This Court, in its judgment of Perera & Others v Central Freight

Burealle of Sri Lanka & another (2006) 1 Sri L.R. 83, has considered a

similar objection as to the standing of the Petitioner. The Court, cited

Premadasa v Wijewardena & Others (1991) 1 Sri L.R. 333 where Tambiah

CJ observed that "the law as to locus standi to apply for Certiorari may be stated

as follows: The Writ can be applied for by an aggrieved parhj who has a grievance

It is undisputed that the Petitioner Company came into possession

of the extent of land proposed to be acquired, with the execution of the

Indenture of Lease P8. It is correct that the rights of the Petitioner

Company are restricted to the ones that had been specified therein. When

the 3rd Respondent made the declaration under Section 5(1) of the Land

Acquisition Act to acquire the said specified extent of land from the said

Estate, for the public purpose of "village expansion" which had been said

to be developed by the Petitioner Company as part of its rubber plantation

of Newlands Estate is qualified to be treated as a grievance.

In the judgments relied upon by the Respondents, this Court had

taken a particular view in relation to the standing of a lessee who had no

statutory rights to possess the disputed portion of land, to seek relief

under judicial review.

7

It is noted that, in Edwin v Tillakaratne (2001) 3 Sri L.R. 34, this

Court has held, in respect of Section 7 of the Land Acquisition Act, that " ...

a 'person interested' may fall into anyone of the categories of persons who have

an "interest" in the land as owner, co-owner, mortgagee and includes also a

lessee. "

The Supreme Court, in its judgment of Balangoda Plantations PLe

v Janaka Bandara Tennakoon, Minister of Lands and Land Development

& Others - S.c. (Writ) 01/2014 - decided on 28.07.2016, dealt with a

similar objection taken on locus standi of the Petitioner who was placed in

almost an identical factual situation as the Petitioner Company. It was

noted by the Court that" the objection raised in this regard is based mainly on

the position that 7111 Respondent, the State Plantation Corporation, is the owner of

the land in dispute and the Petitioner is only a lessee of the 711IRespondent."

Having quoted with approval of the views expressed in Bogawantalawa

Plantations Ltd. v Minister of Home Affairs and Plantation Industries

(2004) 2 Sri L.R. 329, on the expansion of the scope of applicability

principles of standing, the apex Court ruled that the Petitioner had

sufficient locus standi to seek judicial review.

Therefore, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner Company has

sufficient interest to move this Court for judicial review and therefore has

sufficient locus standi to maintain this application.

The main thrust of the complaint by the Petitioner Company is on

the failure to consider its objection to the Notice issued under Section 4,

and also of the failure to afford an opportunity to substantiate its objection

at an inquiry.

8

In their response, the Respondents contended that there was no

denial of an inquiry under Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Land Acquisition

Act by the Petitioner Company and therefore the question of not

considering the objections does not arise. Therefore, it is time this Court

deals with this particular issue.

The Sections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Land Acquisition Act no doubt

deals with the inquiries that are associated with payment of compensation.

Sections 7 and 8 deal with the manner of any person interested in the land

to be acquired should seek compensation, while Sections 9 and 10, under

"Part II" and "INQUIRY INTO CLAIMS, REFERENCE TO COURT, AND

ACQUIRING OFFICER'S AWARD", deals with determination of the

quantum of compensation and the persons who are entitled to such

compensation.

The circumstances that had been relied upon by the Petitioner

Company do not indicate that its compliant is on the procedure adopted

by the Respondent on payment of compensation, but refers to an initial

stage, which are dealt under Section 4 of the said Act.

This Court already noted that the Petitioner Company claimed that

it had objected to the proposed acquisition, when the Notice under Section

4 was served. A copy of the objections addressed to the 2nd Respondent

was tendered annexed to the petition marked P11. The said document is

titled "Objections to Notice issued in terms of Section 4 of the Land

Acquisition Act" and contains "Original by Hand, Counterpart Original by

Registered Post". It was dated 27.06.2001.

9

The Notice under Section 4 of the said Act is dated 11.06.2001 and

the Petitioner Company had objected to the proposed acquisition after 16

days of the issuance of the said Notice. Section 4(3)(d) of the Act imposes a

duty on the relevant authority to specify a time period within which any

objections could be raised on the proposed acquisition. This statutory

requirement was fulfilled by the 1st Respondent, as it was indicated in the

said Notice (P10) that any objections should be raised before 30.06.2001

and should be addressed to the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner Company

had complied and raised its objection during the stipulated time period

and had addressed the same to the 2nd Respondent.

The document P11 indicates that the Petitioner Company had dealt

extensively with its basis of objections and had quantified the ensuing loss

that would be incurred upon the proposed acquisition, in excess of Rs. 5.5

Million. The document P11 has twenty documents attached to it marked

Xl to X20. Among these documents, the Petitioner Company has annexed

a document marked X10, by which the 2nd Respondent indicated to a trade

union that only undeveloped Estate lands would be considered to be

acquired for distribution of land among the landless, without endangering

the employment prospects of the Estate labour community.

Relevant part of Section 4(4) of the Land Acquisition Act in respect

of any objections for the proposed acquisition is reproduced below;

"Where a notice relating to the intended acquisition of a land

or of a servi tude over a land is exhibited under subsection (1)

and objections to such acquisition are made to the

appropriate Secretary by any of the persons interested in the

10

land within the time allowed therefor by the notice, the

appropriate Secretary shall consider such objections or direct

an officer to consider such objections on his behalf and to

make recommendations to him. When such objections are

considered every objector shall be given an opportunity of

being heard in support thereof"

The wording is clear that the appropriate Secretary was statutorily

bound to "consider such objections" and "every objector shall be given an

opportunity of being heard in support thereof'.

The obscure and evasive claim of the Respondents, in respect of the

objections raised by the Petitioner Company to the effect that" the objections

marked Pll are not available in the relevant files of the Respondent and

consequently deny the averments contained therein" could not be accepted.

Surely there must be minutes made by the relevant officials who were

concerned with the decision making in relation to the Pll document which

either confirm or negate the Petitioner Company's claim. The Petitioner

Company cannot be placed at a disadvantageous position owing to this

fact as it is not responsible for the proper maintenance of files of the

Respondents.

Thus, it is clear that the document Pll containing the objections to

the proposed acquisition was not considered by the 2nd Respondent and

the Petitioner Company was not afforded an opportunity to present its

position as per the statutory requirement. In these circumstances the

process of acquisition that had proceeded beyond the issuance of Section 4

Notices is tainted with illegality and ought to be nullified owing to that

reason. 11

Therefore, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner Company is

entitled to the relief prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of its prayer.

Accordingly, this Court issues Writs of Certiorari quashing the decision of

the 3rd Respondent to acquire 8.050 Hectares from the 'Newlands Division'

of the Ambadeniya Estate or 'Newlandwatta' as referred to by the 1st to 3rd

Respondents and his decision made in terms of Section 5 of the Land

Acquisition Act and published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1794/6 dated

21.01.2013.

This Court further directs the 2nd Respondent to consider the

objections of the Petitioner Company and act according to law.

The application of the Petitioner Company is accordingly allowed.

Parties will bear their costs.
