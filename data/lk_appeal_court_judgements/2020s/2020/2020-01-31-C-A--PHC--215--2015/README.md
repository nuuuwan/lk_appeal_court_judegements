This is an appeal against the order of the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge of Galle dated

03.12.2015.

The Petitioners-Respondents-Respondents (Respondents) instituted proceedings under section

66(1) (b) ofthe Primary Courts Procedure Act (Act) on 31.01.2014 and claimed that Respondent-

Respondent-Appellant (Appellant) has encroached onto part of their land. This land is said to be

P. 6.08 in extent and is depicted in plan marked PE2 [Appeal Brief page 196]. The Respondents

further claimed that the said land is 8.5 feet wide and 40 feet in length from the South-Western

part from which side the encroachment is said to have occurred.

The Appellant claimed that the land in dispute is not what the Respondents have identified and

submitted that the Respondents have failed to properly identify the land in dispute and as such

the application must be dismissed.

The learned Magistrate upheld this position and dismissed the application. The Respondents

appealed to the Civil Appellate High Court where the learned High Court Judge held that the land

in dispute was properly identified and that the Respondents had been dispossessed and granted

relief to the Respondents. Hence this appeal.

In an application of this nature it is incumbent on the Magistrate to ascertain the identity of the

corpus as section 66(1) of the Act becomes applicable only if there is a dispute between parties

affecting land. A Magistrate should evaluate the evidence if there is a dispute regarding identity

of the land. [David Apuhamy v. Yassassi Thera (1987) 1 SrLL.R. 253].

The learned Magistrate concluded that parties had submitted different lands as being the corpus

of the dispute and that the Respondents had failed to properly establish which of them was the

corpus forming the subject matter of the dispute.

The learned High Court Judge considered the two site inspection reports dated 21.11.2013 and

04.12.2013 prepared by the Police and concluded that the land in dispute is part of the land called

"Digapotha" which abuts the Galle-Baddegama road. In my view this is the correct approach.

Although the Appellant claims that the Police was biased this claim is difficult to accept given that

the Police did not institute proceedings even though it was the Respondents who first made a

complaint.

The Appellant further submits that the learned High Court Judge erred in granting relief not

prayed for by the Respondents. In particular the complaint is that he ordered the Respondents

to be restored to possession of the land from which they were dispossessed although there was

no specific prayer to that effect.

In Weragama v Bandara (77 N.L.R. 28) and Buddhadasa Kaluarachchi v Nilamanie Wijewickrema

and another [(1990) 1 Sri.L.R. 262] it was held that a court is not entitled to grant relief that has

not been prayed for by a party. This principle has undoubtedly received widespread judicial

recognition in the context of proceedings conducted under the Civil Procedure Code. The apex

courts have conSistently held that a District Court is not entitled to grant reliefs to a party if the

relief is not prayed for in the prayer to the plaint. [Sirinivoso Thero v Sudassi Thera (63 N.L.R. 31),

Wijesuriyo v Senaratna (1997) 2 Sri. L.R. 323, Surangi v Rodrigo (2003) 3 Sri. L.R. 35].

This principle has also recently been adopted in the context of Primary Court proceedings. In Dias

and another v. Dias and another [CA (Rev) Application No: 63/2016; C.A.M. 12.08.2016] a

divisional bench of this court observed as follows:

"We find that the Learned Magistrate has erred in ordering that the respondents be

restored to possession when there is no such prayer in the petition by the respondents. The

respondents had not prayed for restoration of possession this is a private information

under Section 66(l)(b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act in terms of Section 66(l)(b) the

petitioner has to set out the relief sought."

I will now consider whether this decision sets out the correct position of law on the question now

before Court.

Sections 68(1) and (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act (Act) reads:

"(1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof it shall

be the duty of the Judge of the Primary Court holding the inquiry to determine as

to who was in possession of the land or the part on the date of the filing of the-

information under section 66 and make order as to who is entitled to possession

of such land or part thereof.

(2) An order under subsection (1) shall declare anyone or more persons therein

specified to be entitled to the possession of the land or the part in the manner

specified in such order until such person or persons are evicted therefrom under

an order or decree of a competent court, and prohibit all disturbance of such

possession otherwise than under the authority of such an order or decree."

(emphasis added)

These provisions clearly impose a statutory duty on the Primary Court Judge to determine and

declare the persons entitled to possession of the land. They apply to applications made under

section 66(1)(a) as well as under section 66(1)(b) of the Act. There is of course no specific prayer

for relief in an application made under section 66(1)(a) ofthe Act but yet the Primary Court Judge

has a statutory duty to determine and declare the persons entitled to possession of the land. In

this context one cannot argue that the general principle is that a court is not entitled to grant

reliefthat has not been prayed for by a party.

Similarly, I am of the view that even in applications made under section 66(1)(b) of the Act there

is a statutory duty on the Primary Court Judge to determine and declare the persons entitled to

possession of the land. In this instant case this has been done by the learned Civil Appellate High

Court Judge which power he has when acting in revision against the Primary Court order. The fact

that the Respondent has failed to pray for this relief in the affidavit does not relieve the learned

Civil Appellate High Court Judge of the statutory duty imposed upon him.

For the foregoing reasons, with the greatest respect to their lordships in Dias and another v. Dios

and another (supra), I hold that in a private information filed under Section 66(1)(b) ofthe Act it

is not incumbent on the petitioner to specifically pray for restoration to possession. That is a relief

that the learned Primary Court Judge is under a statutory duty to consider and grant after due

inquiry.

In any event, the proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment, decree or

der of any court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which

has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

In the matter before Court, the alleged defect in the prayer of the Respondent's affidavit does

not at any point prejudice the substantial rights of the Appellant or occasion a failure of justice.

For all the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.

Parties in CA(PHC) APN 149/2015 agreed to abide by the judgment given in CA (PHC) 215/2015.

Hence the said revision application is also dismissed with costs.

K.K. Wickremasinghe J.
