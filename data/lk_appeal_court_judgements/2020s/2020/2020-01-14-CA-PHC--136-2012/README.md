The Officer in Charge of the Rathgama Police filed information in terms of

the provisions contained in Section 66(1 )(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act

No. 44 of 1979, (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in the Magistrates Court of

Galle against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants (hereinafter

referred to as the Appellants) and the Respondent-Respondent-Respondent,

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) over a disputed right of way. The

learned Magistrate by order dated 08/07/2008, held that the Appellants were

entitled to use the common right of way granted by a final decree in a partition

action and has no other alternate right of way as claimed. The Appellants being

aggrieved by the said order filed a revision application in the Provincial High

Court of the Southern Province holden in Galle. By order dated 11109/2012, the

learned High Court Judge of Galle, dismissed the said application. It is the said

order that the Appellants are seeking to canvass in this Court.

The information filed by the police dated 18/0112008, refers to an

application in terms of Section 66(1)(a) of the Act. The police having conducted

an investigation to the complaint made by 1 sl Appellant was satisfied that there is

an imminent breach of the peace or a likelihood, and therefore has filed

information before the learned Magistrate.

The Appellants claim that a roadway existed over a co-owned land

described as Lot 15 in survey Plan No. 528 A, marked "3 D 1", for over 1 0 years.

The 2nd Appellant submits that she resides in Lot 27 and 28 and accessed the

disputed roadway which is across Lot 15 in the said plan. The Plan marked "3DI",

tendered to the District Court in partition action bearing No. 16189, clearly shows

a roadway as Lot 31 accessible by Lot 27 and 28, which leads to the V.C. road.

The Appellants in addition to the said existing road are claiming a right of way

over the co-owned property depicted as Lot 15.

From the sketch and the observations submitted by the police officer, it is

observed that there is a roadway marked 'C' (At page 155 of the brief). The

learned Magistrate has correctly identified the said road which has access to

Paranawatta Road. The certificate issued by the Gramasevaka of the area dated

23/04/2008, certified by the Divisional Secretary Hikkaduwa, confirms that the 2nd

Appellant resides in Lot 27 and 28 and has access to the said land through Lot 31,

the common right of way. Therefore, the contention of the 2nd Appellant that there

is no other road to access Lot 27 and 28 other than the disputed roadway is

unfounded.

The Appellants rely on the sketch produced by the police officer and the

affidavits filed in support marked "2 f) 2" and "2 f) 3" to substantiate their claim

to establish a right of way by prescription. However, the documents and the

evidence before Court does not identify a 10 to 12 feet wide roadway over Lot 15,

adversely used by the Appellants.

In Tllambapillai Vs. Nagamanipillai 52 NLR 225, it was held that;

"if is a pre-requisite to the acquisition of a right of way by prescription that a

well-defined and identifiable course or track should have been adversely used by

the owner of the dominant tenement for over ten years. "

"the evidence to establish a prescriptive right o[ way must be precise and definite.

It must relate to a define track and must not consist o[ proof o[ mere straying

across open land at any point which is at the moment most convenient."

(Kandaiah Vs. Seenitamby 17 NLR 29)

The Appellants can obtain a declaration to a right of way on prescription or

on necessity by institution of an action in the District Court. It is observed that the

right of way given by Lot 31 was left in common by a partition decree. Presently,

the parties are before the District Court in partition action No. 16189, to vindicate

their rights over the disputed right of way over co-owned Lot 15. In the

circumstances, I find no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned High

Court Judge. Therefore, I affirm both the orders given by the Courts below and

dismiss this application.

Application dismissed without costs.
