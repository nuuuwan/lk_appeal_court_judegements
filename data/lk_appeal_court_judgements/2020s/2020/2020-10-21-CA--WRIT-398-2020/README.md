Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner was arrested on 14.04.2020 in connection with

the Easter Sunday terror attacks on 21.04.2019, by a team of

officers of the Criminal Investigation Department led by the 6th

Respondent. The Petitioner was detained on Detention Orders

P11(a) and P11(b) signed by the President under the Prevention

of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act. Before the second

Detention Order lapsed, the Petitioner had been released by the

Criminal Investigation Department on 29.09.2020.

The Petitioner in paragraph 32 of the petition says the release of

the Petitioner by the CID as aforesaid clearly contemplates the

fact that the CID has concluded investigations in this regard and

there was no evidence/proof to proceed with the investigations

and/or prosecution against the Petitioner.

However, the Petitioner himself admits in paragraph 34 of the

petition that from the time of his release, fervent attempts were

5

made to re-arrest him. After he was released on 29.09.2020, the

Petitioner says officers of the Criminal Investigation Department

came in search of him the very next day. The Petitioner in the

said paragraph says On 30.09.2020, a group of officers of the

Criminal Investigation Department led by the 5th Respondent

(Officer in Charge of Unit III) has visited Petitioners residence at

No. 29/01/01, Sarraj Tower, Fredrica Road, Colombo 06 and has

inquired about the Petitioner. When Petitioners wife informed

them that the Petitioner had gone out, they have left. In the

same paragraph, the Petitioner also describes the manner in

which the Criminal Investigation Department came in search of

him on 08.10.2020 and 11.10.2020.

It is noteworthy that the Petitioner has been evading the

Criminal Investigation Department from the moment of his

release. Why? The conduct of the Criminal Investigation

Department and that of the Petitioner is, to say the least,

unusual. On the one hand, after the Petitioner was detained for

169 days, there was no reason for the Criminal Investigation

Department to go in search of him immediately after his release,

unless there was something sinister or devious about the

release. On the other hand, as the Petitioner claims in

paragraph 20(d) of the petition that he was released in

accordance with the regular practice of the CID after completion

of the full investigation, there was absolutely no reason for him

to avoid the Criminal Investigation Department after his release

and go into hiding.

The release of a suspect by the police during the course of an

investigation does not amount to the acquittal of an accused by

a Court of law.

Article 12 of the Constitution recognises equality before the law

and the equal protection of the law as a fundamental right.

Article 13 states no person shall be arrested except according to

procedure established by law. However, there is no blanket

prohibition in law preventing a suspect from being re-arrested,

albeit on solid grounds in terms of the law.

In paragraph 34(b) of the petition, the Petitioner says officers of

the Criminal Investigation Department visited the residence of

his wifes parents on 08.10.2020 stating that they wanted to

record a statement from him. Is this illegal? Absolutely not.

The Petitioner in paragraph 33(b) of the petition says the 2nd

Respondent, the Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of

the Criminal Investigation Department at that time, has since

been transferred and the 7th Respondent has been appointed as

the new Deputy Inspector General of Police of the Criminal

Investigation Department. This transfer seems to have been

given effect on 04.10.2020, i.e. within four days of the

Petitioners release. Learned Senior Additional Solicitor General

for the Respondents informs Court the said transfer was on

disciplinary grounds.

According to paragraph 33(a) of the petition, there was a protest

on 04.10.2020 by relatives of victims of the Easter Sunday

attacks over the release of the Petitioner.

7

The said paragraph 33 also reveals that 100 members of

Parliament handed over a letter P15(c) to the President

requesting an inquiry against the CID for releasing the

Petitioner.

All these matters revealed by the Petitioner himself demonstrate

that his release is thought to be under dubious circumstances.

Learned Senior Additional Solicitor General says that in this

complex investigation, the Attorney-General was consulted by

the Criminal Investigation Department for the first time on

12.10.2020, i.e. 13 days after the said release. This, in my view,

is unsatisfactory. I am unable to agree with learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner when he says the Attorney-General

could not have summoned officers of the Criminal Investigation

Department to revisit the matter because it had already been

concluded.

Although this is not the occasion to discuss this at length, let

me quote two sub-paragraphs of section 393 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act to emphasise the powers given to the

Attorney-General in the investigation of an offence, particularly

an offence of a complex nature such as the instant one.

393(2) The Attorney-General shall give advice, whether on

application or on his own initiative to State Departments,

public officers, officers of the police and officers in

corporations in any criminal matter of importance or

difficulty.

8

(3) The Attorney-General shall be entitled to summon any

officer of the State or of a corporation or of the police to

attend his office with any books or documents and there

interview him for the purpose of

(a) initiating or prosecuting any criminal proceeding or

(b) giving advice in any criminal matter of importance

or difficulty:

The officer concerned shall comply with such summons and

attend at the office of the Attorney-General with such books

and documents as he may have been summoned to bring.

Learned Senior Additional Solicitor General says that not only

matters directly connected to the terror attacks but also matters

related thereto, such as money laundering, are under

investigation vis--vis the Petitioner and members of his family,

and therefore, in any event, it cannot be said the Attorney-

Generals intervention at this stage is unwarranted. I fully

agree.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner, drawing the

attention of Court to page 579 of the Hansard dated 06.10.2020,

says the conduct of the Criminal Investigation Department after

the release of the Petitioner is an affront to the President, as the

Petitioner had been released with the knowledge of the

President. However, at page 580 of the same Hansard, at the

end of the first and second paragraphs, the same Minister states

investigations are being continued into this matter under the

direction of a new Deputy Inspector General of Police of the

9

Criminal Investigation Department and there is no barrier to re-

arrest the Petitioner if new evidence is found.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner does not dispute

the right of the Criminal Investigation Department to re-arrest

the Petitioner if new evidence comes to light, but states that an

arrest cannot be made in the hope of collecting new evidence.

Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously submits that the

authorities shall not yield to the demands or requests of the

general public or members of Parliament to re-arrest the

Petitioner after his release following a full investigation.

I agree with learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner that

suspects cannot be arrested/released/re-arrested/hauled-up to

appease or please the public or Parliament. Nonetheless, in the

facts and circumstances of this case, it appears to me, if there is

going to be a re-arrest, it would be on the basis that the release

of the Petitioner was not after completion of the investigation.

That may be the reason the Deputy Inspector General of Police

of the Criminal Investigation Department was transferred and

the investigation is said to be ongoing under a new Deputy

Inspector General of Police, and officers of the Criminal

Investigation Department went in search of the Petitioner soon

after his release. The Petitioner going into hiding immediately

after his release adds credence to this perspective.

Against this backdrop, the submission made on behalf of the

Petitioner that there cannot be a reasonable suspicion that the

Petitioner was connected to or concerned with any unlawful

10

activity relating to any offence under the Prevention of Terrorism

Act or any other law cannot be readily accepted.

Although learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner took

pains to demonstrate that there is no evidence to connect the

Petitioner to the Easter Sunday terror attacks, this Court cannot

scrutinise the said evidence and express views on the same. In

any event, that contention is confined to the evidence unearthed

up to the point of the Petitioners release. The investigation is

continuing.

The relief sought by the Petitioner in the prayer to the petition is

so broad that even if compelling cogent evidence is found, it

would be impossible for the Criminal Investigation Department

to re-arrest the Petitioner on new grounds. The said relief reads

as follows:

Grant and issue an Order in the nature of a writ of

prohibition prohibiting/restraining one or more or all of the

Respondents and any person acting under their direction

and control from arresting and/or taking any steps to arrest

the Petitioner in relation to the investigations pertaining to

or connected with the Easter Sunday Terror Attack that

took place on 21.04.2019 and/or in relation to the matters

regarding which the Petitioner had been detained in

pursuance of the Detention Orders marked P11A and P11B

and subsequently released and/or on the allegation that

the Petitioner has committed and/or is concerned in the

commission or connected with any offence arising out of or

11

in relation to the Easter Sunday Terror attack of

21.04.2019.

The writ Court cannot monitor criminal investigations as a

Magistrate, or perhaps even the Attorney-General, does. Nor

can this Court require the Criminal Investigation Department to

file further reports appraising the Court of progress of the

investigation, to consider whether re-arrest is justifiable. Such

matters may be pursued in a different forum. I can understand

the concerns of learned Senior Additional Solicitor General when

he says he is unable to publicly disclose all the material

evidence as the investigation is still underway.

Notwithstanding that learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner has drawn the attention of Court to several cases

where Orders have been made by the writ Court prohibiting

arrest, I do not think this is a fit and proper matter to issue

formal notice on the Respondents.

The application of the Petitioner is dismissed without costs.
