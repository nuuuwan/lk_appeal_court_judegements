Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner company has filed this application against the 1st

Respondent Commissioner General of Labour and the 3rd

Respondent employee, seeking to quash P14 and P15 whereby

the Petitioner was directed to pay a sum of Rs. 597,590 to the

3rd Respondent, as arrears of salary for the months of June and

July 2009.

The salary slip for the month of January 2009 marked 1R4(c)

shows that the 3rd Respondents last drawn monthly salary was

Rs. 298,795. As seen from 3R2, the 3rd Respondent resigned

from the Petitioner company on 06.08.2009.

According to the Petitioner, the 3rd Respondent had not been an

employee of the Petitioner company at any time whatsoever and

was only a non-executive director of the Board of the Petitioner

3

company. Conversely, the position of the 3rd Respondent is that

he was the Finance Director of the Petitioner company at the

material time.

Let me now narrate the sequence of events, in the manner the

Petitioner states in the petition, regarding the inquiry held by

the 1st Respondent into the complaint of the 3rd Respondent

marked P2 on arrears of salary.

According to the Petitioner, the Petitioner received the letter P7

from the 1st Respondent on 02.04.2013, requiring the Petitioner

to attend the inquiry on 04.04.2013. The Petitioner moved for a

postponement, which was allowed, and the inquiry was put off

for 10.04.2013. On 10.04.2013 also the Petitioner sought a

postponement, which was again allowed. Then, on or around

17.04.2013, the Petitioner received a notice requesting that it

attend the inquiry on 08.05.2013. Again, the Petitioner moved

to postpone the inquiry, seeking further time to furnish the

information sought; this was also allowed. Thereafter the

Petitioner received a telegram on 29.05.2013, requesting that it

attend the inquiry at 1.30 p.m. on the same day. The Petitioner

says it informed the 1st Respondent (presumably over the

telephone) of its inability to attend the inquiry on such short

notice. It appears no representative of the Petitioner was sent to

the place of inquiry seeking a postponement.

On all the days scheduled for the inquiry, the 3rd Respondent, it

appears, was present and prepared.

The 1st Respondent had gone ahead with the inquiry ex parte on

29.05.2013 and made the impugned Order against the

Petitioner.

It is the position of the 1st Respondent, as presented in his

statement of objections, that the Petitioner adopted the above

modus operandi of delaying the inquiry in order to have the 3rd

Respondents claim prescribed in toto.

The 3rd Respondent by P2 complained to the 1st Respondent

about non-payment of salary for five months, i.e. March-August

2009, and non-payment of gratuity for 1988-2009.

However, by the time the impugned Order was made by the 1st

Respondent, the claim for arrears of salary for the first three of

the five months was prescribed in terms of section 50B(c) of the

Shop and Office Employees (Regulation of Employment and

Remuneration) Act, No.19 of 1954, as amended.

It is against this backdrop, according to the 1st Respondent, the

last inquiry date was informed to the Petitioner on short notice

and the inquiry was held without further delay.

The contention of the Petitioner is that it had a legitimate

expectation the inquiry on 29.05.2013 would be postponed. I

am unable to agree. The Petitioner may have had such an

expectation, but it can by no means be considered a legitimate

expectation in the eyes of the law.

At the ex parte inquiry, the 3rd Respondent had produced

documentary evidence to substantiate his claim. Among these

were his Employees Provident Fund Certificate of Membership

5

with the B-card and Central Bank Statement of Accounts

marked 1R1, 1R3(a), 1R3(b); his Employees Trust Fund

Statement of Accounts marked 1R2(a) and 1R2(b); and salary

slips marked 1R4(a), 1R4(b) and 1R4(c). Based on this evidence,

the 1st Respondent made the impugned Order dated 12.06.2013,

directing the Petitioner to pay arrears of two months salary to

the 3rd Respondent.

It is thereafter that the Petitioner, with great vigour, rushed to

this Court on 09.07.2013 to have the said Order set aside.

Together with the petition, the Petitioner tenders a spate of

documents which should have been tendered to the 1st

Respondent at the inquiry. This Court, in the exercise of writ

jurisdiction, cannot hold an inquiry into the payment of arrears

of salary de novo. This has already been done, albeit ex parte.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, as narrated by the

Petitioner itself, I do not think the decision of the 1st Respondent

to have the inquiry ex parte is unreasonable.

The Petitioner has tendered several documents to this Court,

such as P7-P23, P26, P28-P32 P26, P49, P51, to say the 3rd

Respondent was not the Finance Director of the Petitioner

company and the position was held by another person by the

name of Sampath Witharana. Conversely, the 3rd Respondent

has tendered several documents, such as 3R3-3R22, to say it is

he who was the Finance Director of the Petitioner company.

Drawing the attention of the Court to the document marked 3R3

wherein he is identified as the Finance Director, the 3rd

6

Respondent says the said document has been signed by none

other than the present Chairman of the Petitioner company.

The 3rd Respondent, with reference to the documents marked

3R14, 3R15, 3R16, submits that deduction and payment of

Employees Provident Fund, Employees Trust Fund and Income

Tax Deductions (PAYE Tax) are clear proof the 3rd Respondent

was an employee of the Petitioner company. I am in agreement

with this contention.

In response, the Petitioner, producing inter alia P5, says the 3rd

Respondent coerced other officers of the Petitioner company into

remitting contributions in the 3rd Respondents name to the

Employees Provident Fund and Employees Trust Fund.

Investigation into these matters is clearly outside the purview of

the writ Court and perhaps even the Commissioner General of

Labour.

Hence, even on merits, I cannot say the decision of the 1st

Respondent that the 3rd Respondent was an employee of the

Petitioner company and he is entitled to his salary for the

months of June and July 2009 is outrageous or perverse.

Therefore, the Petitioner cannot succeed in this application.

Before I part with this Judgment let me also add the following.

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd v. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd,1

the Supreme Court, citing Loku Menika v. Selenduhamy,2 Habibu

Lebbe v. Punchi Etana,3 Caldera v. Santiagopulle,4 Weeratne v.

Secretary, D.C. Badulla,5 Dingirihamy v. Don Bastian,6 Bank of

Ceylon v. Liverpool Marine & General Insurance Co Ltd,7 and

Nagappan v. Lankabarana Estates Ltd,8 held: A party seeking to

canvass an order entered ex-parte against him must apply in the

first instance to the court which made it. This is a rule of practice

which has become deeply ingrained in our legal system.

A party cannot, without having purged default in the original

Court by which the ex parte Order was made, straightaway come

before the Court of Appeal against such Order on merits. (Jana

Shakthi Insurance v. Dasanayake,9 Penchi v. Sirisena.10)

However, in an exceptional situation, the Court of Appeal can

exercise revisionary jurisdiction to set aside an ex parte

Judgment or Order made by a lower Court, if it is palpably

wrong, perverse and results in a manifest failure of justice. (Mrs.

Sirimavo Bandaranayake v. Times of Ceylon Limited.11)

In my view, this principle of law shall not be confined to judicial

proceedings but shall be extended to inquiries by any tribunal

exercising quasi-judicial or administrative powers that affect the

rights of citizens.

Accordingly, in the instant matter, the Petitioner cannot

straightaway come before this Court against the ex parte Order

4 (1920) 22 NLR 155 at 158. 5 (1920) 2 CLR 180. 6 (1962) 65 NLR 549. 7 (1962) 66 NLR 472. 8 (1971) 75 NLR 488. 9 [2005] 1 Sri LR 299 at 303. 10 [2012] 1 Sri LR 402 at 408. 11 [1995] 1 Sri LR 22 at 40.

made by the 1st Respondent, more so as the impugned Order is

not, as I have already stated, palpably erroneous.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with costs.
