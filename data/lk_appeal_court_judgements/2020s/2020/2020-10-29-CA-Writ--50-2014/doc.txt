When this matter was taken up for argument on 15th May 2019, all learned Counsel

moved that judgment in this matter be delivered on the written submissions that

have already been tendered by the parties. This Court thereafter directed the parties

to submit their responses to certain matters on which clarifications were required,

which was duly complied with by all parties.

The issues that arise in this application have a history of almost half a century, dating

back to the enactment of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law No. 1 of 1973 (the

CHP Law), which is the Act of Parliament that this Court is called upon to consider in

determining the said issues.

The CHP Law was enacted inter alia, to regulate the ownership of houses, as stated in

the long title to the Law, and came into operation on 13th January 1973.1 Section 2

specifies the maximum number of houses which may be owned by an individual with

a distinction being drawn between an individual who is a member of a family and an

individual who is not a member of a family. In terms of Section 2(5), An individual

shall for the purposes of this Law be deemed to be a member of a family if such

individual has a spouse or a dependent child or is a dependent child of any

individual.

Section 2(1) provides as follows:

The maximum number of houses which may be owned by an individual who is

a member of a family shall be such number of houses which together with the

number of houses owned by the other members of that family is equivalent to

the number of dependent children, if any, in that family, increased by two.

Therefore, in terms of the CHP Law, an individual and his spouse, who have no

children, can own a maximum of two houses. Section 2 further sets out the manner

in determining the maximum number of houses that could be owned by a body of

persons. The maximum number of houses as determined by Section 2 is referred to

as the permitted number of houses that a person may own after the introduction of

the CHP Law.

The house that is the subject matter of this application is situated at premises No. 11,

16th Lane, Kollupitiya. On the date that the CHP Law came into effect, the said house

1 See the judgment of Sarath Silva, J (as he then was) in Kathiresan vs Sirimevan Bibile, Chairman, Board of Review and Others [(1992) 1 Sri LR 275 at 279] where he stated that: An examination of the provision of this Part (I) shows that there are two principal methods of such regulation. They are: (i) the imposition of a ceiling on the number of houses that may be owned by individuals or other bodies. This ceiling is provided for in Section 2; (ii) by giving a right to any tenant to make an application to the Commissioner for the purchase of a house rented to him.

was owned by Agnes Fonseka. It is not in dispute that Agnes Fonseka and her

husband, R.C. Fonseka owned more houses than the permitted number of houses,

and that as they did not have children, the permitted number of houses that they

could own was two.

Section 8 of the CHP Law requires a person who owns houses in excess of the

permitted number of houses to submit a declaration to the 1st Respondent, the

Commissioner of National Housing. While Section 8(1) relates to a declaration that

an individual who is not a member of a family and who owns houses in excess of the

permitted number of houses on the date of commencement of the CHP Law shall

make, Section 8(2), which is the Section that is applicable to this application, reads as

follows:

Where houses in excess of the permitted number of houses are owned on the

date of commencement of this Law by the members of a family, the male

spouse, or where such male spouse is not living or is not capable in law so to do,

the female spouse, shall within twelve weeks of such date, send by registered

post to the Commissioner2 a declaration:

(a) specifying the number of houses owned by each member of such family

including houses owned in undivided shares;

(b) specifying the houses the ownership of which the members of such family

proposes to retain: and

(c) giving such particulars relating to the houses referred to in paragraph (a)

as are set out in the Schedule hereto.

Such spouse shall simultaneously intimate in writing to the tenant, if any, of

each house owned by each member of such family the ownership of which is

not proposed to be retained that the ownership of such house is not proposed

to be retained.

2 The reference to Commissioner in the Act is to the Commissioner of National Housing.

5

Section 8(5) provides further that, Any house the ownership of which is not

proposed to be retained in terms of any declaration made under this section, ....., is

hereinafter referred to as a surplus house

Section 8(4) of the CHP Law provides that:

Any person who has, without reasonable cause, failed to send the declaration

within the period referred to in subsection (1) or subsection (2), as the case may

be, or has made any incorrect declaration in regard to the number of houses

owned by him or by his family, as the case may be, shall be guilty of an offence

under this Law, and any such house owned by such person or by any member of

the family of such person as may be specified by the Commissioner by

Notification published in the Gazette shall vest in the Commissioner with effect

from such date as may be specified therein.

As Agnes Fonseka together with her husband owned houses over and above the

permitted number of houses, she was required to submit a declaration in terms of

Section 8(2), on or before 7th April 1973. By letter dated 28th May 1974, marked R3,

the 1st Respondent, Commissioner of National Housing had informed Agnes Fonseka

that she had not submitted her declaration in terms of Section 8(2), and to submit

same, within fourteen days3 together with the list of houses that she has alienated

during the period 13th January 1973 12th January 1974.

By letter dated 19th September 1976,4 the husband of Agnes Fonseka had informed

the 1st Respondent that by letter dated 9th July 1973 I had forwarded to you under

registered cover by post, the fullest details about my properties, and my wifes

properties. He had thereafter proceeded to reiterate in the said letter that he

owned the following houses, as is said to have been intimated by his letter of 9th July

1973:

3 Agnes Fonseka has claimed that she submitted a declaration on 25th June 1973 and 9th July 1973 (page 533 of P2). Even if she did, the said declarations are outside the time period set out in Section 8. 4 Vide letter dated 19th September 1974 at page 477 of P2.

Assessment Number Status as at 19th September 1976 1 173, W.A.Silva Mawatha Firewood Shed 2 546, Galle Road, Kollupitiya Used as an Office 3 374, Galle Road, Kollupitiya Used as an Office 4 370, Galle Road, Kollupitiya Gifted on 7th January 1974 to S. Salgado 5 364, Galle Road, Kollupitiya Will be retained by Agnes Fonseka5 6 1, 10th Lane, Kollupitiya Gifted on 12th January 1974 7 15, 10th Lane, Kollupitiya Gifted on 7th January 1974 8 9/7, 16th Lane, Kollupitiya Used as an Office 9 11, 16th Lane, Kollupitiya Gifted on 11th January 1974 10 9/5, 16th Lane, Kollupitiya Sold to a 3rd party as tenant had informed he does not wish to purchase 11 90, Lauries Road, Milagiriya6 Will be retained by the declarent7

Thus, in terms of Section 8(2), with Agnes Fonseka and her husband declaring that

the houses situated at No. 364, Galle Road, Kollupitiya and No. 90, Lauries Road,

Milagiriya are the two houses that they wish to keep, the rest of the houses referred

to above were houses in excess of the permitted number of houses. Therefore, the

house that is the subject matter of this application is a house which was in excess of

the permitted number of houses that Agnes Fonseka could have owned with her

husband, and was therefore a surplus house within the meaning of Section 8(5).

There are five important features in Section 8(2), namely:

1) Any individual who together with his spouse have houses in excess of the

permitted number of houses must submit a declaration;

2) The said declaration must be submitted within 12 weeks of 13th January 1973;

3) The said declaration must set out the number of houses owned by such person;

4) The said declaration must set out the houses that such person proposes to

retain;

5 Vide letter dated 13th February 1974 at page 521 of P2. 6 This house was owned by R.C. Fonseka. 7 Vide letter dated 13th February 1974 sent by R.C.Fonseka at page 525 of P2.

7

5) Such individual shall simultaneously intimate in writing to the tenant, if any, of

each house the ownership of which such individual or body does not propose to

retain, that the ownership of such house is not proposed to be retained.

I must note at this stage that even though Section 8(2) required Agnes Fonseka or

her husband to simultaneously intimate in writing to the tenant of each house the

ownership of which they did not propose to retain, of such fact, there is nothing to

indicate that such notice was in fact given to the tenant of No.11, 16th Lane,

Kollupitiya.

The purpose of giving notice to the tenant that the owner does not wish to retain the

house of which he/she is the tenant is to enable the tenant of such house to act in

terms of Section 9 of the CHP Law, which reads as follows:

The tenant of a surplus house or any person who may succeed under section 36

of the Rent Act to the tenancy of such house may, within four months from the

date of commencement of this Law, apply to the Commissioner for the purchase

of such house.

It is admitted that Agnes Fonseka had rented out one of the houses situated on the

said premises to T. Wijeyesingham, while the other house comprising of three rooms

had been rented to Somapala Samarakkara.8 Although this Court has not been

apprised of the reasons, it is admitted that the application of T. Wijeyesingham to

purchase the house had been refused by the 1st Respondent, and that he had

vacated the house after the appeal to the Board of Review was rejected in 1978. The

other tenant, Somapala Samarakkara had also made an application to the 1st

Respondent in terms of Section 9 of the Act seeking to purchase the said house. It is

the application of Samarakkara that has given rise to this application.

Section 10 of the CHP Law sets out the steps that a person may take in respect of the

houses which are in excess of the permitted number of houses, and is re-produced

below:

8 See proceedings of 12th February 2004 at page 365 of P2 and proceedings of 9th December 2003 at page 373 of P2, for a description of the house occupied by Samarakkara.

8

Where, on the date of commencement of this Law, any person owns any house

in excess of the permitted number of houses, such person may, if such person is

an individual, within a period of twelve months from such date .... dispose of

such house with notice to the Commissioner, unless the tenant of such house or

any person who may under section 36 of the Rent Act No. 7 of 1972, succeed to

the tenancy of such house, has made application with simultaneous notice to

the owner for the purchase of such house.

Thus, Section 10 permits a person who owns more houses than the permitted

number, to sell the excess house/s, subject to the following conditions:

1) The sale must be done within twelve months of 13th January 1973;

2) Notice of such sale must be given to the Commissioner;

3) An excess house can be sold only if the tenant has not applied to the

Commissioner to purchase such house.

It must be noted that the tenant is required to provide the owner with a copy of the

notice that he gives to the 1st Respondent under Section 9.

Section 8(6) of the Act provides as follows:

Where the ownership of any surplus house has been transferred by way of

sale, gift, lease or other alienation, without the owner thereof having

intimated in writing to the tenant thereof, as required by subsection (1) or

subsection (2), that the ownership of such house is not proposed to be retained

by him, and such tenant makes an application to the Commissioner to purchase

such house the Commissioner may, with the approval in writing of the Minister,

by Order published in the Gazette vest such house in the Commissioner with

effect from such date as may be specified in such Order.

Section 11(1) provides that, Any house owned by any person in excess of the

permitted number of houses which has not been disposed of within the period within

9

which such person may dispose of such house in accordance with the provisions of

section 10 shall on the termination of such period vest in the Commissioner.

In terms of Section 12(2), when the Commissioner of National Housing proposes to

sell any such house vested in him, he shall in the first instance offer to sell such

house to the tenant, if any, of such house.

The above provisions of the CHP Law therefore contains the mechanism to extract

the excess number of houses that a person may own at the time the CHP Law came

into force and to sell such house to the tenant occupying such house, thereby

achieving the object of the CHP Law which was the regulation of the ownership of

houses.

The house that relates to this application was a house that Agnes Fonseka did not

wish to retain, and therefore was a house she was entitled to sell. Accordingly, Agnes

Fonseka did exercise her right in terms of Section 10 by executing a Deed of Gift in

favour of Aleric Wickremasinghe. However, her right to sell was subject to the three

conditions I have already referred to.

Let me now consider if each of the said conditions have been satisfied.

The first condition is that the sale must be done within twelve months of 13th January

1973. On the face of it, this has been complied with as the Deed of Gift No. 237 in

favour of Aleric Wickremasinghe has been executed on 11th January 1974.9 The

second condition is that notice of such sale must be given to the Commissioner. It

appears that this too has been complied with.10

The third condition, namely that a house which is in excess of the permitted number

of houses cannot be sold where the tenant has applied to the Commissioner to

purchase such house, is the condition in Section 10 that has given rise to this

application, with the tenant Samarakkara claiming that:

9 I say on the face of it for the reason that Samarakkara has alleged that the said Deed was a forgery on the basis that Aleric Wickremasinghe was known by a different name in 1974, and changed his name to Aleric Wickremasinghe only thereafter. 10 Vide letter dated 11th January 1974 marked R2; also at page 531 of P2.

10

(a) an application had in fact been made to the 1st Respondent to purchase the

property; and

(b) the alienation of the said house by Agnes Fonseka in favour of Aleric

Wickremasinghe is therefore, bad in law.

This is the basis for the competing claims of Samarakkara and the Petitioner.

The application of Samarakkara to purchase the said house had been refused by the

1st Respondent by his letter dated 28th January 1991.11 The appeal by Samarakkara to

the Board of Review against the decision of the 1st Respondent too had been

rejected.12 Samarakkara had thereafter filed CA (Writ) Application No. 370/2001

seeking to quash the above decisions. While the said application was pending, Aleric

Wickremasinghe had passed away, and his nephew, the Petitioner in this application,

and to whom the land had been gifted by Aleric Wickremasinghe, had been

substituted in that application.13

By its judgment delivered on 18th November 2002,14 this Court had made the

following Order:

Parties agree that therefore the decision of the Board of Review dated 2nd

February 2001 is erroneous and has to be set aside. Accordingly, this Court

issues a writ in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the Order of the 3rd

5th Respondent dated 2nd February 2001 marked as P7. Upon agreement of

parties, this Court directs the Commissioner to hold an inquiry under Section 9

of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law, specially as the position taken up in this

case is that this is an excess house which had vested in the Commissioner by

operation of the said Law.

The 1st Respondent was therefore required to consider the application of

Samarakkara made under Section 9 to purchase the said house.

11 Vide page 421 of P2. 12 Vide page 417 of P2. 13 The Petitioner has passed away in 2018, and his wife and two children have been substituted. 14 The judgment is at page 102 of P1.

11

Prior to proceeding with the inquiry, the 1st Respondent had permitted the

substitution of the Petitioner in place of Aleric Wickremasinghe.

The scope of the inquiry before the 1st Respondent was to decide whether the

application of Samarakkara under Section 9 of the Act to purchase the said house

should be allowed. A decision in favour of Samarakkara required the 1st Respondent

to determine whether the said house was a house which Agnes Fonseka had decided

not to retain, and therefore was in excess of the permitted number of houses of

Agnes Fonseka.

After affording both parties a hearing, the 1st Respondent by an Order delivered on

21st December 2006 had held as follows:15

;SrKh lrKq ,efnS'

Thus the decision of the 1st Respondent was that the said house was as excess house

of Agnes Fonseka and that Samarakkara is entitled to be sold the said house,

together with the land appurtenant thereto. The only matter left to be decided was

the extent of the land that was appurtenant to the said house.

Dissatisfied with the said decision of the 1st Respondent, the Petitioner had lodged

an appeal with the Board of Review on 26th January 2007. While the matter was

pending before the Board of Review, Samarakkara had passed away. The 6th

15 Vide Order of the 1st Respondent at page 43 of P2.

12

Respondent, who was the executor of the last will of Samarakkara, and who had

been granted probate in District Court, Colombo Case No. DTS00014/09 had made an

application to be substituted. Even though the Petitioner had objected to the said

substitution, the Board of Review, by its Order made on 23rd June 2010,16 had

permitted the substitution of the 6th Respondent. It must be noted that the

Petitioner has not challenged the said Order made by the Board of Review allowing

the substitution of the 6th Respondent in place of Samarakkara, until it was

challenged in this application.

The Board of Review, having considered the appeal of the Petitioner against the

Order of the 1st Respondent, had, by its Order delivered on 21st January 2014,

dismissed the said appeal.17

Dissatisfied with the said decision of the Board of Review, the Petitioner filed this

application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Board of Review dated 21st

January 2014;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Commissioner of National

Housing dated 21st December 2006;

c) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the Board of Review dated 23rd

June 2010 permitting the substitution of the 6th Respondent in place of

Somapala Samarakkara.

In Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service,18 Lord Diplock

identified 'illegality', 'irrationality' and 'procedural impropriety' as being the grounds

upon which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. He then

went onto describe illegality and irrationality in the following manner.

By 'illegality' as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision maker

must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and

16 Order is at page 81 of P1. 17 Order of the Board of Review is at page 1 of P1. 18 [1985] AC 374

13

must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable

question to be decided in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by

whom the judicial power of the state is exercisable.

By irrationality I mean what can now be succinctly referred to as Wednesbury

unreasonableness19. It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its

defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who

had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the

aforementioned decisions of the Board of Review and the decision of the 1st

Respondent are illegal and irrational. Before I proceed to consider the several

arguments raised by the learned Presidents Counsel, I would like to summarise the

legal position applicable to this application.

a) The CHP Law was enacted in 1973, and was certified on 13th January 1973.

b) The CHP Law sought to impose a ceiling on the number of houses that could be

owned by an individual, a family and a body of persons.

c) The aforementioned three categories of persons who owned houses in excess

of the permitted number of houses were required to submit a declaration

within 12 weeks of 13th January 1973.

d) In the said declaration, the owner was required to declare the details of the

houses that the owner proposed to retain.

e) Thus, the failure to submit a declaration attracts penal consequences a well as

the vesting of such premises in the Commissioner.

f) In addition, and very importantly, simultaneous with the said declaration, the

owner was required to inform the tenant of each house that the owner did not

propose to retain, of such fact.

19 Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation 1948(1)KB 223

14

g) The Commissioner could vest such house where the owner has failed to give

such notice to the tenant.

h) Once informed by the owner, the tenant had the right to make an application in

terms of Section 9 to purchase the house he or she was living in.

i) In terms of Section 10, the tenant is required to simultaneously give notice of

his application to the owner.

j) The Law has provided the owner the right to sell any houses which are in

excess, provided such sale is done within one year i.e. on or before 13th

January 1974 and very importantly, provided there is no application by the

tenant to purchase the house.

k) Thus, the right to sell is contingent upon an application by the tenant to

purchase the house. If the tenant has made an application, then, the owner

cannot sell that house.

l) Any house which has not been disposed of within the one year period shall vest

in the Commissioner by operation of law.

m) The Commissioner is required to offer for sale to the tenant, any house vested

in him, prior to offering such house to third parties.

I shall now consider the several arguments presented to this Court on behalf of the

Petitioner.

The first argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner is that an

application in terms of Section 9 must be made within four months of the coming

into operation of the CHP Law. He states that the application by Samarakkara has

been made on 23rd May 1973, which is outside the four month period, and is

therefore not a valid application.

It is not disputed that even though there have been two inquiries before the 1st

Respondent, two inquiries before the Board of Review and one Writ application

before this Court relating to the application of Samarakkara, this position is being

15

taken up for the first time, only in this application.20 The learned Counsel for the 6th

Respondent has correctly taken up the position that this objection should have been

taken up at the first available opportunity, and that by his failure to do so, the

Petitioner has acquiesced with the application of Samarakkara.

I am of the view that whether the application is out of time is a mixed question of

fact and law which should have been raised before the 1st Respondent and the Board

of Review, thus affording the parties an opportunity of clarifying matters. No

explanation has been offered by the Petitioner as to his failure to do so.

I must state that the application of Samarakkara has not been made available to this

Court, nor was it available at the time Samarakkara gave evidence before the 1st

Respondent. Samarakkara had been cross examined in detail by the Counsel who

appeared for the Petitioner at the inquiry before the 1st Respondent relating to the

application made by him.21 However, not a single question has been asked from

Samarakkara relating to the date of his application, nor has any suggestion been

made to him that his application is outside the time period in Section 9.

How did this issue with regard to the date of the application then arise? In its Order

dated 21st December 2006, the 1st Respondent has stated that File No. CH/O/978 had

been opened on 27th June 1973.22 That does not mean that the application of

Samarakkara has been made on that date. The Board of Review, in its Order dated

21st January 2014 has stated that Samarakkara made his application on 23rd May

1973.23 This appears to be the only reference to the date of the application of

Samarakkara.

As I have observed, the application of Samarakkara was not available even at the

inquiry, it was not put in issue by the Petitioner, and therefore, I am not in a position

to ascertain the basis for this statement by the Board of Review, nor am I in a

position to conclude that the application of Samarakkara is outside the four month

period set out in Section 9.

20 This issue has not been raised, either in the petition of appeal to the Board of Review [vide page 275 of P1] nor in the written submissions tendered to the Board of Review [vide page 236 of P1]. 21 Vide proceedings of 22nd April 2004 at page 353 of P2; 22 Vide page 134 of P1 CHO/978 ,sms f.dkqj wdrusn jS we;af;a 1973.06.27 osk isg nj fmfka 23 Vide page 4 of P1.

16

Furthermore, in terms of Section 8(2), simultaneous to the filing of the declaration

with the Commissioner, Agnes Fonseka was required to inform the tenant of each

house that she did not propose to retain, of that fact, thus enabling the tenant to

make a decision whether to make an application to the 1st Respondent to purchase

the house occupied by such tenant. This view is supported by the fact that while the

declaration by Agnes Fonseka must be made within twelve weeks, Samarakkara had

a period of four months, or in other words, twenty-six days from the last date

available to the owner, to submit his application to purchase the said house. In other

words, the entitlement of Samarakkara to make an application was contingent upon

Agnes Fonseka making a declaration. I have already stated that Agnes Fonseka did

not submit her declaration as required by Section 8. Her reply that she did submit a

declaration, even if accepted, is that she did so on 9th July 1973. This is clearly outside

the 12 week period provided by Section 8.

Thus, even if Samarakkara made his application outside the four month period, it

would not be fair to penalise Samarakkara as he had no notice of the intention of

Agnes Fonseka. This gives context to the submission of the learned Senior State

Counsel for the 1st Respondent and the learned Counsel for the 6th Respondent that

the time period specified in Section 9 is not mandatory, as the CHP Law does not

specify the consequences for not adhering with the time period, unlike with the

failure on the part of the owner to give notice to the tenant. Therefore, even if there

is a failure by Samarakkara to make his application within time, that is not fatal to

the maintainability of his application. In any event, by the time the declaration of

Agnes Fonseka is said to have been made, Samarakkara had already made an

application to purchase the house.

For all of the above reasons, I do not see any merit in the first argument advanced on

behalf of the Petitioner.

Having concluded that the application by Samarakkara is within the provisions of the

CHP Law, I shall now consider whether the sale of the said premises by Agnes

Fonseka to Aleric Wickremasinghe is valid in terms of the CHP Law.

17

The Board of Review, having considered the material, had decided that (a) Agnes

Fonseka was not entitled to sell the said house as Samarakkara had already made an

application, and therefore the disposition in favour of Aleric Wickremasinghe is a

nullity ab initio; (b) the house shall therefore vest in the Commissioner.

I have already noted, and it is in fact admitted by all parties, that Agnes Fonseka had

houses in excess of the number of houses permitted by the Law. The CHP Law

required her to do two things first, submit a declaration within 12 weeks to the 1st

Respondent. Second, simultaneous to the submission of the declaration, submit a

notice to the tenant of each house that she does not propose to keep, informing the

tenant of that fact. As already observed, the purpose of doing so is to enable the

tenant to make a decision whether he wishes to purchase the house, and if so, to

enable the tenant to make an application in terms of Section 9.

The entitlement of Agnes Fonseka to sell an excess house is contingent upon an

application by the tenant, and is triggered only if an application has not been made

by the tenant. It was submitted on behalf of the Petitioner that Samarakkara did not

give notice of his application to Agnes Fonseka, and that Agnes Fonseka was

therefore entitled to sell the said house. However, there is no evidence to

substantiate the position that Samarakkara did not notify Agnes Fonseka of his

application nor has Samarakkara been cross examined on this matter at the inquiry

before the 1st Respondent. As Samarakkara had made an application to purchase the

said house, Agnes Fonseka had no entitlement to sell the said house to any person.

There is one other matter that I must advert to. That is to the fact that

Wijayasingham who was occupying another house on the same premises as a tenant

of Agnes Fonseka had made an application to purchase the house on 26th March

1973, which is within the stipulated time period.24 It is in fact Wijayasingham who

had alerted the 1st Respondent to the fact that Agnes Fonseka owned many houses

in Colombo and that she had not submitted a declaration in terms of the Law.

Although his application was rejected many years later, Agnes Fonseka could not

have executed a deed in favour of Aleric Wickremasinghe as, in any event, the

24 Vide page 503 of P2. The application of Wijayasingham had been refused by the 1st Respondent and by the Board of Review on 11th July 1978 vide written submissions of the Petitioner at page 235 of P1.

18

application of Wijayasingham made within the four month window, was pending by

then.

For all of the above reasons, the findings of the Board of Review that Deed No. 237 in

favour of Aleric Wickremasinghe executed on 12th January 1974, is contrary to the

provisions of the CHP Law, and is invalid, is not an illegal decision.

The second argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that

the space occupied by Samarakkara is not a house, and therefore the provisions of

the CHP Law would not apply.

In terms of Section 47 of the CHP Law, a house means:

an independent living unit, whether assessed or not for the purpose of levying

rates, constructed mainly or solely for residential purposes, and having a

separate access, and through which unit access cannot be had to any other

living accommodation, and includes a flat or tenement, but shall not include

(1) sub-divisions of, or extensions to, a house which was first occupied as a

single unit of residence; and

(2) a house used mainly or solely for a purpose other than a residential

purpose for an uninterrupted period of ten years prior to March 1, 1972.

Although the Petitioner sought to argue that the space occupied by Samarakkara was

only the garage of the house, that position has not been suggested to Samarakkara

during his cross examination. In fact, he was cross examined on the nature of the

house at the inquiry before the 1st Respondent, and his evidence was very clear that

what was being occupied was an independent living unit comprising of three rooms

and a toilet with separate access.25

I have referred to the fact that Samarakkara challenged the decision of the Board of

Review rejecting his application in CA (Writ) Application No. 370/2001. In its

judgment dated 18th November 2002, this Court has held as follows:

25 Vide proceedings held on 12th February 2004 at page 365 of P2, and 8th December 203 at page 373 of P2.

19

Upon agreement of parties, this Court directs the Commissioner to hold an

inquiry under Section 9 of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law, specially as the

position taken up in this case is that this is an excess house which had vested in

the Commission by operation of the said Law.

It is also to be noted that in terms of a minute made in the record that had been

called for and perused by this Court, this house had been registered since 1962

as a house. (vide minute dated 10th September 1975.)....

The above judgment has not been appealed against, and therefore there is a clear

finding by this Court that the space occupied by Samarakkara is a house. While the

Petitioner cannot canvass that issue any further, this was the basis on which the

Board of Review dismissed the said argument. I am of the view that the said decision

of the Board or Review is neither illegal nor irrational.

For the above reasons, I do not see any merit in the second argument of the

Petitioner.

The third argument of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was that the

6th Respondent cannot be substituted in place of Samarakkara, who passed away

while the appeal of the Petitioner was pending before the Board of Review, as he

does not fall within the category of persons referred to in Section 36 of the Rent Act.

It was submitted that:

(a) In terms of Section 9 of the CHP Law, it is only a person who may succeed

under section 36 of the Rent Act to the tenancy of such house who can be

substituted; and

(b) As the 6th Respondent does not fall within the category of the persons referred

to in Section 36, the 6th Respondent cannot be substituted.

Let me consider this argument by re-producing Section 9:

20

The tenant of a surplus house or any person who may succeed under section 36

of the Rent Act to the tenancy of such house may, within four months from the

date of commencement of this Law, apply to the Commissioner26 for the

purchase of such house.

Section 36 of the Rent Act contains provisions regarding the continuation of the

tenancy upon the death of the tenant. Section 36(2) of the Rent Act provides inter

alia that any person who in the case of residential premises which has been let prior

to the date of commencement of the Rent Act is the surviving spouse or child of the

deceased tenant and who was a member of the household of the deceased tenant

during the period of three months preceding the death of the tenant, shall be

deemed for the purposes of the Rent Act to be the tenant of the premises.

In my view, Section 9 of the CHP Law permits two categorises of persons to make an

application to purchase a house. The first is the tenant himself. The second is, where

the tenant dies during the period provided for in Section 9 to make an application,

any person who may succeed under section 36 of the Rent Act to the tenancy of such

house. Thus, the legislature, by specifically referring to Section 36 of the Rent Act in

Section 9 has extended the right of a tenant to purchase a house in terms of the CHP

Law to the heirs of such tenant, in the event the death of the tenant occurs during

the period specified in Section 9.

The learned Senior State Counsel has correctly pointed out that Section 9 only deals

with the question who can make an application to the Commissioner? and not with

the question, who can succeed to a deceased tenants proprietary rights.

The 6th Respondent has been substituted in place of Samarakkara not on the basis

that he is a tenant. Samarakkara had nominated the 6th Respondent as the executor

of his last will, and the 6th Respondent has been granted probate by the District

Court. Thus, the 6th Respondent has been substituted in place of Samarakkara for the

purpose of pursuing Samarakkaras application to the 1st Respondent. The learned

Counsel for the 6th Respondent has correctly submitted in his written submissions

that the beneficiaries of the Order made by the 1st Respondent would not be the 6th

26 The reference to Commissioner is to the Commissioner of National Housing, the 1st Respondent in this application.

21

Respondent, but the three persons named in the last will of Samarakkara as

beneficiaries. Thus, the decision to permit the substitution of the 6th Respondent is

within the law.

I must also state that the Board of Review allowed the substitution of the 6th

Respondent by its Order dated 23rd June 2010, only after considering the objections

of the Petitioner to the said substitution. That Order has not been challenged, until

this application was filed in 2014. The learned Senior State Counsel and the learned

Counsel for the 6th Respondent have taken up the position that the said Order cannot

be challenged at this stage due to the delay in doing so. I am in agreement with the

said submission and take the view that if the Petitioner was dissatisfied with the

Order of the Board of Review regarding substitution, he ought to have challenged

that decision soon thereafter. I am therefore in agreement with the learned Counsel

for the Respondents that the Petitioner is guilty of laches in so far as the Order of

substitution is concerned.

Taking into consideration all of the above factors, I do not see any merit in the third

argument of the Petitioner.

This brings me to the final argument on behalf of the Petitioner. It was sought to be

argued that even though he made the application in 1973, Samarakkara had paid the

rent to Aleric Wickremasinghe in 1988 and 1989, thereby recognising

Wickremasinghe as the owner.27 Samarakkara has admitted in his evidence that he

did pay the rent, but only because Wickremasinghe had demanded that the rent be

paid to him, at the funeral of Agnes Fonseka.28 Samarakkara had stated that in any

event, Wickremasinghe did not encash the money orders sent to him.

The learned Senior State Counsel has submitted that even if Samarakkara had

acquiesced with the title of Wickremasinghe, that has no bearing on the 1st

Respondent. While agreeing with the said submission, I am of the view that the fact

that Samarakkara paid the rent to Wickremasinghe has no bearing on his application

for the reason that the transfer of the house to Wickremasinghe was contrary to the

provisions of the CHP Law, and therefore Wickremasinghe had no rights as an owner.

27 Vide proceedings of 22nd April 2004 at page 359 of P2. 28 Vide proceedings of 24th June 2004 at page 339 of P2.

22

Taking into consideration all of the above circumstances, I do not see any legal basis

to grant the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner. This application is accordingly

dismissed, without costs.
