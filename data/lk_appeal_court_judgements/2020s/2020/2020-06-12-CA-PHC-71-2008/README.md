in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction under Article 154P (3) (b)

Having identified the subject matter of the dispute, the learned

Magistrate made the following findings:

(i) the 2"" and 3'" Respondents were in possession of the areas of

land on the date of the filing of the information on 14.05.2002;

Application in Revision to the Provincial High Court

191 Being aggrieved of the said order of the learned Magistrate of

Balapitiya, the 1" Respondent made an application in revision to the

P~ovincial High Court holden in Balapitiya seeking to have the said

order of the learned Magistrate dated 13.03.2003 revised and declared

null and void. After inquiry, the learned High Court Judge by his

judgment dated 22.07.2008 affirmed the order of the learned

Magistrate and dismissed the revision application ..

Appeal to the Court of Appeal

1101 Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the learned High Court

Judge of Balapitiya dated 22.07.2008; the 1" Respondent has preferred

this Appeal to this Court.

. ' Submission of the 1" Respondent on the Procedure Adopted by the

Learned Magistrate for conducting a Local Inspection

III j At the hearing of this appeal, thy learned Counsel for the I"

Respondent submitted that the procedure adopted by the learned , . Magistrate in conducting the inspection .2 months after the date of the

C.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC Balapitiya 511-2003-M.C. Balapitiya 43273

.-

first information was filed on 14.05.2002 was contrary to the provisions

of the Primary Courts Procedure Act. He further submitted that the

order made by the learned Magistrate under section 68 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act disreg-dl-ding the affidavits and the Police

Investigation notes offend the mandatory provisions of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act and therefore, the said order dated 13.03.2003

is null and void.

(a)Scope of the Inquiry under Section 68 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act

1121 In the present case, the dispute between the 1" Respondent and

tlle 2"'1 and 3

n1 Respondents relates to the possession of a land under

Part VII of the Primary Courts Procedure Act (hereinafter referred to

as the 'Act'). In an inquiry into a dispute as to the possession of any

land under section 68 (I), the main point of decision is as to who was

in possession of the land on the date of the filing of tlle information to

tlle Court under section 66 of tlle Act. Section 68 (3) becomes

applicable where tlle judge can come to a definite finding that some

other party had been dispossessed within a period of 2 months next

preceding the date on which the information was filed.

1131 The procedure of an inquiry under Part VII of the Act IS SUI

generis and the procedure to be adopted and the manner in which the

proceedings are to be conducted are clearly set out in sections 66, 71

and 72 of the Act (RamailiJgam II. Thangarajah 1982 (2) Sri LR 693, at

p. 699). Section 72 prescribes the matters on which the determination

under section 68 and 69 of the Act is to be based and such

detennination under Part VII shall be made after examination and

consideration of-

e.A. (PHC) 7 I -2008 - PHC Balapitiya 5 I 1-2003-M.e. Balapitiya 43273

(a) The information filed and the affidavits and documents

furnished;

(b) Such other evidence on any matter arising on the affidavits or

documents furnished as the court may permit to be led on that

matter; and

(c) Such oral or written submissions as may be permitted by the

Judge of the Primary Court in his discretion.

1141 A wide discretion has been given to the Primary Court judge under

section 72 to decide on the type of evidence and material on which he

should act in making his determination under section 68 (I) or 68 (3) of

the Act. The only limitation is that he must act judicially and as far as

practicable, depending on the circumstances of each case.

1151 While the rule is that the determination should be founded on the

information filed and the affidavits and documents furnished by the

parties, oral testimony is an exception to be permitted only at the

discretion of the judge and such discretion should be exercised judicially

only in a fit case and not as a matter of course (RamaiJiJgam v

Thang-drajah (supra, at p. 701). When the possession or dispossession of

any of the' parties at the relevant time is disputed, then the Court may

permit oral evidence of the parties to be led and the witnesses should be

directed to that question only, namely, for the purpose of ascertaining

the true position without however, converting the inquiry into a full scale

trial of civil issues, as in a civil case (supra).

1161 Where the information filed and the affidavits and documents

furnished under section 66 (2) are sufficient in the opinion of the Judge

to make a determination under section 68, either for the determination

qf the identity of the land in dispute or'the question of possession and

C.A, (PHC) 7\-2008 - PHC 8a\apitiya 5\\-2003-M.e. 8a\apitiya 43273

'.

.'

dispossession, any further inquiry embarked by the Judge IS not

warranted by the mandatory provisions of section 72 of the Act.

(b) The Validity of the Inspection made by the Magistrate on 03.01.2003

1171 If the identity of the land or part thereof, is disputed by one or

more of the parries, it is incumbent on the Judge of the PrimillY Court to

identify the land which is the subject matter of the dispute before

proceeding to consider the question of possession under section 68 (I)

of the Primary COUlts Procedure Act (DaVld Appuhamy v. Yassassi

Thera 1987 (I) Sri LR 253 at 260). In such case, if the Judge of the

Primary Court is of the view that a local inspection is necessalY for the

identification of the land in dispute, he is entitled in my view, to inspect

the land in question with the consent of the parries for that purpose.

1181 Let me first deal with the question whether the learned Magistrate

who was acting in her capacity as a PrimalY Court Judge under the

Primary Courts Procedure Act was justified in conducting a local

inspection of the disputed areas of land before making tlle order under

section 68 of the Act. The 1" Respondent has taken up the position in

his affidavit tllat the 2"" and 3" Respondents made the disputed

constructions within a burial ground, which is lot 19D in Plan No. 353

exclusively used by their family. The 2'" and 3"' Respondents have taken

up the position that the 3'd Respondent constructed a rubble wall about 5

years ago to prevent the soil erosion of the compound of his garden and

other constructions were made in their land called "Robolleege

Katukurudu Watta". Their position was that the disputed burial

cemetery is located abutting their land in which burials of their relations

too had taken place.

C.A. (PHC) 712008 PHC 8alapitiya 5112003 M.C. 8alapitiya 43273

1191 The First Police Officer (Police Sergeant 8746) who made notes on

11.05.2002 had observed the disputed constructions, namely, two

manholes, drain lines and a rubble wall about 3 feet in height within the

land claimed by the I" Respondent. The Second Police Officer (Sub

Inspector Silva) who made observations on the direction of the learned

Magistrate on 15.05.2002 too had observed a rubble wall about 3 feet in

height, constructed by the 2"" and 3'" Respondents in front of their

newly built structures. He had further observed that the right side of the

rubble wall had been raised by the 2"" and 3'" Respondents by another 1

foot on 15.05.2002. He had however, not made any reference to the

manholes or drain lines observed by the First Police Officer.

1201 In view of the absence of the any referenc~ to the manholes and

drain lines in the notes of the Second Police Officer and the position

taken up by the 2"" and the 3" Respondents that the I" Respondent had

made the Police Complaint without a proper identification of the land in

question, the learned Magistrate was justified in expressing her difficulty

in making the order without a local inspection. The minutes of the

learned Magistrate dated 22.01.2003 at page 426 of the brief are as

follows:

c::i'dIeD t:J8r:too @I!DJtJJ6 ~aJ @&b ~@ (ft:Jl!i)fj &Jt) @t:JIeif. r!J emJtJ c::i'dIeD t:J8r:tooW t::J.JI::x!iJtJcJeD t:JX@tjJ cdB ~ ~@. 0'0 t:JX@t5J &JeJ ce1tJ:J 8tJ. c::i'dIeD t:J~ :30/ 01

12 J I She has further stated in her order dated 12.03.2003 that the local

inspection was required for the identification of the disputed areas of

land as indicated at page 306 of the brief:

~ {fexJJ{:j (j)f) @<:}ti5 fu ~ 2003.01.30 tJc& Em (ftJt:JJ6J1xx:j tJ8eiJ ~ tfJf)~J1xx:j @CJX)() {fct:.

1221 It is absolutely clear that the learned Magistrate deemed that a local

inspection was necessary for the identification of the disputed areas of

land and hence, she was justified in deciding to have a local inspection

with the consent of the parties. Hence, the learned Magiso-ate had

properly conducted the local inspection in the presence of the parties

and their attorneys (Vide- observations of the learned Magiso'ate at page

299 of the brief).

1231 During the heaJing, the learned Counsel for the 1" Respondent

conceded that the inspection was conducted with the consent of the

parties. However, his complaint was that the inspection should have

been conducted within a period of 2 months from the date of the

information filed by the Police on 11.05.2002. He aJ'gued that the

inspection made 8 months after the date on which the information was

filed by the Police was contrary to the time-limit prescribed in section 68

(3) of the Act.

1241 Section 78 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act read with section

428 of the Civil Procedure Code confers powers on a Judge of the

Primary Court to conduct a local inspection in person for the purpose of

identification of the land or part thereof which is the sUQject matter of

the dispute.

1251 The learned Counsel for tlle 1" Respondent furtller submitted that

at tlle local inspection, the learned Magistrate had failed to make any

observations or inquiry witll rq,rard to the period and/or time of such

constructions made within the burial /,'Tound. In my view, a local

inspection by the Judge of the Primary COUlt is permitted within its own

limitations and where it is done for the purpose of identification of the

C.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC 8alapitiya 511 -2003-M.C. 8alapitiya 43273

land or part thereof, such inspection shall be limited to that purpose

only.

1261 Unless the parties have consented to be bound by any order made

by a Magistrate upon a local inspection, the learned Magistrate in my

view is only entitled to embody in her inspection notes, the facts

observed by her on the spot. The Magistrate is not, however, entitled to

embotly in her inspection notes the facts stated to her there i.e.

statements made to her by the witnesses and make use of such facts to

determine the question of possession and dispossession.

1271 If the Magistrate conducts an inspection for the purpose of

identification of tl1e subject matter in question, but oversteps or exceeds

his limitation and decides the question of possession or dispossession

under section 68 by solely relying on inspection notes, disregarding the

affidavits, documents and notes of the investigating officers, he would be

acting in violation of section 72 of the Act.

1281 It is imperative that when the inspection IS done for the

identification of the land in dispute or parts thereof, the inspection

should be directed to that question only and the Judge should not allow

the ii1spection notes to be used for the sole purpose of the

determination of the possession and dispossession under section 68.

The determination of the question of possession or dispossession under

section 68 shall always be based on the examination and consideration

of material prescribed by section 72 of the Act.

1291 Hence, the determination as to who was in possession of the land

or part of the land on the date of the filing of the information under

section 68 (1) and where section 68 (3) applicable, the determination

that some party had been forcibly disposses;;ed witl1in a period of 2

.'

months next preceding the date on which the information was filed

under section 66 (I) shall be made after the examination and

consideration of matters set out in section 72 of the Act.

(c) Long Delay of the Local Inspection

1301 I shall now proceed to consider the submission made by the

learned Counsel for the 1" Respondent that the long delay in making the

inspection after the alteration of the status quo by the 2"d and 3'd

Respondents made the inspection irrelevant for the determination of the

question of possession and dispossession under section 68 (I) and 68 (3)

of the Act.

1311 The information was filed by the Bentota Police on 14.05.2002 in

pursuant to a Complaint made by the 1" Respondent to the Bentota

Police on 11.05.2002. The first investigation notes made by Police

Sergeant 8746 dated 11.05.2002 refer to the 2 manholes, drain lines and

a rubble wall about 3 feet in height constructed by the 2nd and 3rd

Respondent within the disputed land. The second investigation notes

made by Sub Inspector Silva indicate that on 15.05.2002, the 2'" and 3'd

Respondents had raised the right side of the rubble wall by 1 foot. Sub

Inspector had however, directed the 2nd and 3rd Respondents not to

make further constructions. The parties filed original aflidavits and

counter affidavits and thereafter, written submissions were filed on

04_12.2002. As noted, the leall1ed Magistrate was of the view that a local

inspection was necessary for the identification of the disputed areas and

hence, the inspection was held on 30.01.2003.

1321 Except for raising the right side of the wall by 1 foot on 15.05.2002,

I find that no material had been placed before the learned Magistrate by

the 1" Respondent that after 15.05.2002, further constructions were

C.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC Balapitiya 511-2003-M.e. Balapitiya 43273

made by the 2"" and 3" Respondents or that they altered the smtus quo

of the land after the Police directed them not to make further changes to

the disputed land.

1331 Accordingly, I am of the view that the smtus quo that prevailed on

15.05.2002 after the Police prevented the 2'" and 3" Respondents from

making any further constructions, remained unchanged at the time of

the inspection made by the Learned Magistrate on 30.01.2002. The I"

Respondent has failed to present credible material to satisfy this Court

that the smtus quo had been materially altered by the 2"" and 3"

, Respondents after 15.05.2002 and thus, the local inspection became

irrelevant. The I" Respondent has further failed to present credible

material that any prejudice had been caused to the I" Respondent by the

inspection conducted by the learned Magistrate on 30.01.2003.

(d) Identity of the Subject Matter of the Land or Part thereof

1341 I shall now proceed to consider the question whether the learned

Magistrate had properly identified the location of the disputed areas of

land before proceeding to consider the question of possession and

dispossession under section 68 of the Act.

1351 It is not in dispute that the land called "Robollege Katukurundu

Watta and Ratrnahara Pathiya" is depicted in Plan No. 353 prepared for

the District COUIt of Galle Partition Case No. 11 226 and lot 19D in

extent of 1 rood and 32 perches depicted in the said Plan was allotted to

all 20 defendants in common (Vide- X12 and XI3). It is also not in

dispute that the burial ground in question is abuttinl:, the 2"" and 3"

Respondents' land. The existence of a burial ground is 'not in dispute in

the present case.

e.A. (PHC) 71-2008 . PHC Balapitiya 5112003 M.e. Balapitiya 43273

'.

1

1361 The 1" Respondent and the 4"' to 8"' Respondents had stated in their

affidavits that the dispute related to the encroachment of 3-4 perches of

the burial !,'Tound and the construction of drain lines with manholes and

a circular rubble wall by the 2"" and 3'" Respondents within the burial

ground on 11.05.2002. (Vide- paragraph 7 of the affidavit of the 1"

Respondent dated 28.07.2002 and paragraph 4 of the affidavit of the 4"'

to 8

ili Respondents dated 30.07.2002).

1371 The learned Magistrate who inspected the land in dispute in the

presence of the parties and their attorneys on 03.011.2003 had made the

following observations:

(a) The disputed land was abutting the land of the 2"" and 3"

Respondents and there was a fence between the two lands on the

railway side and some Kottamba Trees were standing at a distance

of 25 feet;

(b) A square type concrete slab existed between the two Kottamba

Trees and a shower had been put up by the 2"" and 3'"

Respondents on the said concrete slab and some tomb existed 2

'/2 feet away from the 2"" Kottamba Tree within the burial ground;

(c) Two concrete posts had faflen, one near the 2"" Kottamba Tree

and the other about 30 feet away from the 2'" Kottamba Tree;

(d) A circular rubble wall had been constructed on the disputed land,

of which 3 feet of the wall is located within the 2"" and 3"

Respondents' land while the remaining part of the wall is located

within the land claimed by the parties to the dispute as a

cemetery;

C.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC BaJapitiya 511-2003-M.e. Balapitiya 43273

(e) There was no clear boundary line between the two lands in the

area close to the rubble wall which is overgrown with weeds on

both sides of the land;

(f) Some tombs were visible on the land claimed to be a burial

ground by the 1" Respondent and further, a boundary line was

visible between the land claimed to be a burial ground and the

land of the 2" and 3" Respondents when the inspection was made

from the place where the Police Jeep was parked.

1381 The learned Magistrate has however, not observed the manholes

due to the overgrown weeds in the area at the time of the local

inspection (pages 300-304 of the brief). However, the learned Magistrate

has clearly examined the observation notes made by P.S. 8746 who had

noted the existence of two manholes, a drain line and a rubble wall

within the land in question.

1391 A perusal of the inspection notes made by the learned Magistrate

and her order dated 13.03.2003 clearly reveals that she had only used

inspection notes to facilitate the identification of the land in dispute and

thus, she has not overstepped her limits in conducting the local

inspection. On the other hand, the learned Magistrate has also examined

the investigation notes made by P.S. 8746 and Sub Inspector Silva, the

affidavits of the parties and the annexed documents to identify the

subject matter of the dispute.

1401 I am of the view that the procedure adopted by the learned

Magistrate in conducting the inspection with the consent of the parties

cannot be held to be prohibited by sections 66, 71 and 72 of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act. For those reasons, I hold that 'the learned , , Magistrate had examined the investigation notes made by the two Police

e.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC 8alapitiya 511-2003-M.e. 8alapitiya 43273

..

Officers, the affidavits of the parties, annexed documents and her

observation notes and properly determined that the subject matter of the

dispute relates to the areas of land in which drain lines, 2 manholes and

a half circular rubble wall were located within the burial ground (Vide-

page 626 of the brief).

The Question of Possession and Dispossession

1411 The learned Counsel for the 1" Respondent submitted that the

learned Magistrate had solely relied on the inspection notes made by

her 8 months after the date of the information was filed under section

66 of the Act and wrongfully determined the question of possession and

dispossession under section 68 of the Act. The learned Counsel lor the

1" Respondent strongly relied on the two notes made by Police Sergeant

8746 on 11.05.2002 and Sub Inspector Silva on 15.05.2002 and ar/,rued

that the rubble wall in question had been constructed on or about

11.05.2002 and thus, it was not a structure made beyond 2 months

immediately prior to the filing of the information on 14.05.2002.

1421 The learned Counsel for the 1" Respondent further submitted that

the learned Magistrate had disregarded the two notes made by the

Police Officers and erroneously held that the 1" Respondent had failed

to establish that the structures in question had been built within the

period of 2 months prior to the date on which the information was filed

by the Police.

1431 I shall now proceed to consider whether the learned Magistrate

had overstepped the limits and made use of his local inspection in such

a manner to decide the question of possession or dispossession

disregarding the affidavits and documents furnished and notes made by

the Police Officers on 11.05.2002 and 15.05.2002.

C.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC Balapitiya 511-2003-M.e. Balapitiya 43273

1441 Sections 68 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act reads as

follows:

68 (J) Vf'here the dispute relates to the possession of any land or

part dJereoi, it shall be dJe duty of the Judge of the Pnmary

COUlt holdliJg the Inquiry to determIiJe as to who was IiJ possession of the land or the part on the date of the filIng of the Inkmnation under section 66 and make order as to who is entJded to possession of such land or part thereof

1451 The main point for the determination under section 68 (1) is as to

who was in possession of the land or part thereof on the date of the

filing of the information under section 66. The learned Magistrate

having identified the subject matter of the dispute had proceeded to

determine the next question, namely, as to who was in possession of

the land on the date of the filing of the information on 14.05.2002. Her

observations in her order at page 306 of the brief are as follows:

1461 The complaint of the 1" Respondent was that the 2"" and 3"

Respondents had encroached onto the disputed burial ground, which

was exclusively used by his family members, demolished tombs,

constructed buildings, a rubble wall and drain lines with manholes on

11.05.2002. The same position had been taken by the 4ili to 8"'

Respondents in their affidavits without any supporting documents.

1471 In pursuant to the first complaint made by the 1" Respondent on

11.05.2002, the Police Sergeant 8748 had visited the place of the

t .A. (PHC) 712008 PHC Balapitiya 5112003 M.e. Balapitiya43273

.

dispute and observed that (i) the 2"" and 3'" Respondents had

constructed a two-storied new building within their land; (ii) in front of

the said building and beyond the claimed boundary line, the 2"" and 3"

Respondents had constructed a rubble wall which is about 3 !eet in

height on the land claimed by the 1" Respondent; (iii) 2 manholes with

drain lines had been constructed by the 2'" and 3"' Respondents with

concrete blocks in the disputed land to flow water of the 2"" and 3'<1

Respondents' hotel and house into the 1" Respondent's land.

1481 A perusal of both notes made by two Police Otlicers reveals that

they had not noted that the disputed constructions, including the

rubble wall (3 feet in height) and drain lines with manholes had been

constructed by the 2-' and 3" Respondents on 11.05.2002 as claimed

by the 1" Respondent and the 4'" to 8" Respondents. Sub Inspector

Silva had only noted that the right side of the rubble wall which was

about 3 feet in height at that time had been raised by the 2"' and 3"

Respondent~ by 1 foot on 15.05.2002.

1491 A perusal of the order made by the learned Magistrate reveals that

she has correctly relied on the notes made by Police Sergeant 8748 and

his sketch and decided that the two manholes marked 'D' and 'F' had

been constructed with concrete blocks by the 2"" and 3" Respondents

before the date of the filing of the information on 11.05.2002.

1501 Furthermore, Sub Inspector Silva had also observed a heap of

rubble on the ground closer to the rubble wall on the disputed land

and that they had been oveq,'ToWIl with weeds, which he had noted,

indicated that the rubble had been brought to the disputed land by tlle

2"" and 3'" Respondents sometime ago. The observations of Sub

Inspector Silva at page 267 of the brief are as follows:

151 1 On the other hand, the 1" Respondent himself has admitted in his

own first Complaint made to the Bentota Police on 11.05.2002 that (i)

the 2'" and 3" Respondents constructed an unauthorised Tourist

Restaurant on the disputed burial ground 5 years ago; (ii) thereafter,

they entered into the same land and constructed a permanent building

1 year ago; (iii) they made holes behind his father's tomb which is

located inside the burial ground and put waste of their turtle hatchery

into these holes; and (iv) they fixed a telephone post inside the burial

ground, laid a concrete slab on the ground and fixed a shower to a

concrete post by removing one of the temporarily fixed concrete posts.

1531 The position of the 1" and the 4" to 8

m Respondents that all

constructions were made by the 2'" and 3" Respondents on 11.05.2002

is clearly not credible and not supported by the investigation notes

made by the two Police Officers on 11.05.2002 and 15.05.2002. The

C.A. (PH C) 71-2008 - PHC 8alapitiya 511-2003-M.C. 8alapitiya 43273

first complaint made by the 1 st Respondent himself to the Bentota

Police on 11.05.2002 contradicts his own position taken in his affavits.

1541 In the result, the learned Magistrate has come to a correct finding

that the disputed constructions had been made by the 2,,,1 and 3"

Respondents on the disputed land long time before the date of the

filing of the information on 14.05.2002. Accordingly, the learned

Magistrate has correctly held under section 68 (1) of the Act that the

disputed areas of land, including the constructions in question had

been in the control and possession of the 2"d and 3'd Respondents on

the date of the filing of the information on 14.05.2002.

Forcible Dispossession of the 1" Respondent within a Period of 2

Months from the Date of the Information filed under Section 66 (1)

1551 Sections 68 (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act reads as

follows:

"68(2) WheIC~ at an IiJqUIiy Into a dispute relaailg to the light to the possession of any land or any part of a land theJudge of dJe PrImary

Court is saa"sfied that any person who had been IiJ possession ofdJe land or part has been forcibly dispossessed Wlduil a period of two months Immediately before the date on which the IiJformaaon was filed under secaon 6"6; he may maKe a detelmIiJaaon to dJat efJ(xt and make an order direcailg dJat dJe party dispossessed be restored to posseSSIon and pJVhibiaiJg all disturbance of such posseSSIon otherWIse dJalJ under the authon{Y of an Older or decree of a competent COUIt. "

1561 Section 68 (3) becomes applicable only if the Judge ofthe Primary

Court can come to a definite finding that some other party had been

forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately before

the date on which the information was filed under section 66 of the Act

(RamalIiJganl v. 77JalJgarajah (supra). Thus, it is the duty of the Primary

C.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC Balapitiya 511-2003-M.e. Balapitiya 43273

Court Judge to detennine whether the I" Respondent had been

forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2 months immediately before

the date on which the information was filed under section 66 of the

Act.

1571 Having determined that the 2'd and 3'" Respondents had been in

possession of the disputed areas of the land, the learned Magistrate had

proceeded to consider under section 68 (2) of the Act, whether the I"

Respondent had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of 2

months immediately before the date on which the information was

filed by the Police on 14.05.2002 (Vide- pages 622 and 623 of the

brief).

158] It was the contention of the learned Counsel for the I"

Respondent that the learned Magistrate had erred in holding that there

was no evidence to satisfy that the circular rubble wall had been

constructed within a period of 2 months from the date of the filing of

the infonnation on 14.05.2002. He relied on the notes of the two

Police Officers and submitted that the Police observation clearly

establish that the disputed constructions were made by the 2"" and 3'd

Respondents on 11.05.2002. The I" Respondent has stated in his

affidavit dated 28.07.2002 that the 2'd and 3"' Respondents entered into

the burial ground and demolished old tombs of the land, constructed a

circular type rubble wall and a drain line with manholes in an area of

about 3-4 perches. Paragraph 7 of his affidavit dated 28.07.2002 reads

28.07.2002 that the 2'" and 3" Respondents entered into the disputed

land on or about 11.05.2002 and made the unauthorised structures,

including the circular type rubble wall, manholes and drain lines on

11.05.2002. Paragraph II of the said affidavit dated 28.07.2002 is as

1601 As noted in paragraph 52 of this judgment, the I" Respondent has

clearly admitted in his Police Complaint made on 11.05.2002 that the

2'" and 3,01 Respondents first entered into the disputed burial ground 5

years ago, constructed a tourist restaurant 5 years ago and thereafter a

made a permanent building 1 year ago. He has further admitted in his

Police Complaint that the 2,.,1 and 3,,1 Respondents encroached an

extent of 6-7 purchases onto his land, dug holes behind his father's

tomb and put waste from their turtle hatchery into those holes, fixed a

telephone pole and laid a concrete slab for supporting a shower by

removing a concrete post attached to the boundary line.

1611 The admissions of the I" Respondent that the 2'" and 3"

Respondents entered into the disputed land and constructed a hotel 5

years ago and thereafter a permanent building 1 years ago clearly

neg-d.te the position taken by the 1" Respondent and the 4" to 8"

Respondents in their aflidavits that the 2'" and 3"1 Respondents first

e.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC Balapitiya 511-2003-M.e. Balapitiya 43273

entered into the disputed land and carried out all the unauthorised

constructions on 11.05.2002.

1621 The 1" Respondent stmngly relies on the notes made by the two

Police Officers to establish that the 1" Respondent had been

dispossessed by the 2'd and 3'" Respondents when they made disputed

constructions on 11.05.2002. The 1" Respondent in particular, relies

on the obseIVation made by Sub Inspector Silva that when he visited

the disputed land on 15.05.2002, the 2'd and 3'" Respondents were in

the process of raising the lllbble wall by another 1 foot.

1631 The position of the 2'" and 3'" Respondent was that the 3'd

Respondent only repaired the old lllbble wall constructed by him 5

years ago to prevent soil erosion of the 3'" Respondent's compound as

the 3" Respondent was in the possession of the disputed constructions.

1641 Police Sergeant 8746 who investigated the complaint made by the

1" Respondent on 11.05.2002 had obseIVed that when he visited the

disputed land, a lllbble wall about 3 feet in height had been

constructed in front of the newly constructed building of the 2'''' and 3'd

Respondents and further, drain lines with manholes had also been

constructed in the disputed burial ground claimed by the 1"

Respondent. If the lllbble wall, drain lines with manholes were

constructed by the 2"d and 3'" Respondents on 11.05.2002 as claimed

by the 1" Respondent, Police Sergeant 8746 would have obseIVed

recent constructions and noted them his investigation notes. He, had

not however, noted that the said lllbble wall was a recent construction

as claimed by the 1" Respondent.

1651 On the other hand, Sub Inspector Silva too had not noted on . . 15.05.2002 that the lllbble wall in question had been constructed

C.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC Balapitiya 511-2003-M.C. Balapitiya43273

recently as claimed by the 1st Respondent. He had observed that (i) the

left side of the constructed circular rubble wall was about 1 foot in

height and the right side of the rubble wall was about 3 feet in height.

The notes of Sub Inspector Silva, do not indicate whatsoever, that the

entire rubble wall in question was a recent construction as claimed by

tlle 1" Respondent. His notes only indicates that the height of the right

side of the rubble wall had been raised by 1 foot on 15.05.2002 by the

2"" and 3" Respondents (Vide- notes at page 267 of the brief).

1661 As noted, Sub Inspector Silva had observed on 15.05.2002 that a

heap of rubble brought by the 2'" and 3" Respondents was lying on the

ground closer to the rubble wall in question and the said heap of

rubble had been overgrown with weeds, this indicates that said rubble

had been brought sometime ago by the 2'" and 3" Respondent~. His

notes at page 267 of the brief are as follows:

1671 "Forcibly dispossessed" in section 68 (3) means, that dispossession

had taken place a!:,'ainst tlle will of the persons entitled to possess and

without authority of the law (Iqbal v. Mqiedudeen and odJers 119991 3

Sri L.R. 213). In tlle present case, the 1" Respondent's own first

complaint made on 11.05.2002 clearly indicates that the 2'" and 3"

Respondent had entered into the disputed burial ground 5 years ago,

encroached a portion of the said land and constructed an unauthorised

tourist restaurant 5 years ago and made a permanent building 1 year

ago prior to 11.05.2002.

1681 The investigation notes of both Police Oflicers together with the 1"

Respondent's own Compliant to the Police on 11.05.2002 clearly

e.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC 8alapitiya 511-2003-M.e. 8alapitiya 43273

indicate that the disputed constructions had been made by the 2"" and

3" Respondents in the disputed land long time ago.

1691 It fUither strengthens the findings of the learned Magistrate who

had referred to the circular rubble wall shown on the photographs

marked 2V4-2V7 and stated that the said wall was a strong wall made

up of rubble and that although the said rubble wall was not about 5

years old, it was certainly not recently built as claimed by the I"

Respondent. The findings of the learned Magistrate in her order at

page 310 of the brief are as follows:

1701 The disputed circular rubble wall had been constructed just in

front of the 2'" and 3'" Respondents' building which is situated within

the burial ground as noted by P.S 8746 and the drain lines with

manholes had been constructed beyond the area in which the rubble

wall had been constructed witllin the disputed land. The said manholes

are located in an area beyond the circular rubble wall as indicated in

the sketch prepared by P.S 8746 on 11.05.2002. The said area is

clearly located clqser to the land of the 2'" and 3" Respondents, which

also suggests that the areas in which the rubble wall and manholes are

located were in the control of the 2"" and 3" Respondents long before

the information was filed by the Police on 14.05.2002.

1711 It seems to me, therefore, that the unauthorised acts complained

of had taken place before a period of 2 months immediately prior to

C.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC Balapitiya 511-2003-M.C. Balapitiya 43273

the date on which the information was filed under section 66 of the Act

by the Bentota Police on 14.05.2002. Under such circumstances, the

learned Magistrate was justified in holding that the 1" Respondent had

failed to satisfy that he had been forcibly dispossessed within a period

of 2 months immediately before the date on which the information was

filed by the Bentota Police on 14.05.2002 under section 66 of the Act.

1721 It has been held in the case of Ramaiingam v. ThangarajaiJ (supra)

that even a trespasser can claim possession under section 68 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act. In the said case, Sharvananda, J.

observed at page 698:

"Thus, the duty of" the Judge in proceedJiJgs under section 68 i5 to ascertain which party was or deemed to have been In possession on the relevant date, namely, on the date of" the fihng of" the Inf"ormation under section 66. Under section 68, the Judge is bound to maintl1Jn the possession of" such person even If he be a rank of" trespasser as agaInst any Interference even by the JlghtIul owner. This section entJdes even a squatter to the protectJon of" the law, unless his possessIOn was acquired within two months of" the /ihiJg of dJe

Inf"ormatJon '~

1731 I hold that the learned Magistrate had not overstepped her

limitations by determining the question of possession or dispossession

solely on the inspection notes made by her on 30.01.2003 disregarding

the affidavit~ and Police notes made on 11.05.2002 and 15.05.2002 as

submitted by the learned Counsel for the 1" Respondent. The learned

Magistrate in my view has correctly determined the question of

possession and dispossession on the examination and consideration of

the affidavits, annexed documents and investigation notes of the two

Police Officers as required by section 72 of the Act.

C.A. (PHC) 71-2008 - PHC Balapitiya 511-2003-M.C. Balapitiya 43273

1741 In the present case, the 1" Respondent has failed to establish that

he was forcibly dispossessed within two months prior to the filing of the

information and thus, under section 68 (1) of the Act, the only

determination that can be made by the learned Magistrate was that the

2"d and 3'" Respondents were in possession of the disputed areas of

constructions on the date of the filing of the information on

14.05.2002.

Conclusion

175J For those reasons, I hold that the learned Magistrate has correctly

decided tllat the 2"d and 3'd Respondents were entitled to possession of

the disputed areas of constructions. Hence, I do not see any reason to

interfere with the determination of the learned Magistrate of Balapitiya

dated 13.03.2003 and the judgment of the learned High CourtJudge of

Balapitiya dated 22.07.2008.

1761 In the circumstances, the Appeal filed by the 1" Respondent is

dismissed with costs.
