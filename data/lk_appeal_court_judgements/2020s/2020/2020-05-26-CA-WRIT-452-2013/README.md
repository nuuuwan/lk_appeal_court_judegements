The 4th Respondent was employed at the Petitioner Bank from 21.04.1992 to 30.11.2008. The

subject matter of this application is the surcharge due on the delayed payment of gratuity to

the 4th Respondent by the Petitioner.

The total due as gratuity is the sum of Rs. 39,47,200/=. A sum of Rs. 1,973,600/= was paid to

the 4th Respondent on 15.05.2009, which is 50% of the total due, and the balance of Rs.

1,973,600/= was paid on 17.11.2009. The gratuity should have been paid on 30.12.2008.

The 4th Respondent made two complaints to the Commissioner-General of Labour, P4 and P9,

claiming a surcharge for the delayed payment.

The first complaint P4 is dated 17.05.2010. The proceedings of the inquiry into this complaint

are marked 1R1 to 1R3. A sum of Rs. 1,973,600/= was paid to the 4th Respondent on 15.05.2008

as the 1st installment of the gratuity which is within the 6 months after the due date. Section

5(4)(c) of the Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983 (Act) as amended specifies that the

surcharge should be 20% of the sum due when the delay is between one to six months as in this

case. Therefore, the surcharge due on the 1st installment of Rs. 1,973,600/= is Rs. 3,94,720/= as

correctly calculated.

The 2nd complaint P9 is dated 17.11.2011. The proceedings of the inquiry into this complaint are

marked 1R4 to 1R6. By P10 the Petitioner was directed to pay a sum of Rs. 493,000/= as

surcharge for the delay in paying this second installment. This amount has been computed

according to section 5(4)(d) of the Act which specifies a surcharge of 25% of the sum due when

Page 4 of 4

the delay is between six months to twelve months as in this case. Hence, the surcharge

imposed by P10 is lawful and in accordance with the Act.

The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari quashing P10. It is claimed that the Petitioner is not

subject to section 10 of the Act. However, other than the mere ipse dixit, the Petitioner has not

explained in the written submissions why the Petitioner is not caught up within section. A

careful examination of section 10 of the Act establishes that it applies to every employer.

It was further submitted that the 3rd Respondent failed to appreciate that the Petitioner had

made payment of terminal benefits to the 4th Respondent in excess of the amount legally due.

However, the Petitioner has failed to establish this position. In any event, it is irrelevant as the

issue is whether the gratuity was paid by the due date. Parties cannot by agreement exclude

the application of the provisions of the Act. Undoubtedly there has been a delay in the payment

of gratuity and the surcharge due has been properly calculated.

For all the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed. The Petitioner shall pay the 4th

Respondent a sum of Rs. 50,000/= as costs of this application.
