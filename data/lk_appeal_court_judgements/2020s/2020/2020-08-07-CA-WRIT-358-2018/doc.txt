Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioners are admittedly tenants of the business premises

No.14, 1st Cross Street, Maharagama, owned by the 12th

Respondent. The 12th Respondents attempt to eject the

Petitioners by a rei vindicatio action was unsuccessful. Both the

District Court and, on appeal, the Civil Appeal High Court held

that the Petitioners are tenants protected under the Rent Act,

No.7 of 1972, as amended, and cannot be ejected otherwise than

under the provisions of the said Act.

Less than five months after the appeal Judgment, the occupant

of the adjoining premises sent the letter marked P5 dated

24.07.2018 to the Chairman of the Public Petitions Committee of

the Western Provincial Council through a Member of the

Provincial Council, seeking to demolish the premises in suit on

the ground that the premises, which the said occupant claims is

more than ninety years old, is in a dilapidated condition

endangering his and his employees lives.

The Public Petitions Committee of the Provincial Council held an

inquiry into the matter and recommended to the 9th Respondent,

the Maharagama Urban Council, that the premises be

demolished.

By filing this application, the Petitioners seek to quash the said

recommendation by certiorari predominantly on the basis that

the Public Petitions Committee of the Provincial Council has no

power to recommend the demolition of the premises when the

premises are admittedly governed by the Rent Act.

5

The Petitioners say this is a collusive attempt between the owner

of the premises in suit and the occupant of the adjoining

premises to eject the Petitioners, which the former could not

achieve through lawful means.

Learned Counsel for the Maharagama Urban Council submits

that Rule 87 of the Rules of Procedure of the Western Province

Provincial Council empowers the Public Petitions Committee of

the Provincial Council to make recommendations, which it did

by P7(b).

I regret my inability to agree with this submission. By

recommending the demolition of the premises that two

competent Courts successively held are governed by the Rent

Act, the Public Petitions Committee effectively wipes out the

tenancy of the Petitioners.

According to Rule 87(11) of the Rules of Procedure of the

Western Province Provincial Council, the implementation of a

recommendation of the Public Petitions Committee is virtually

compulsory.

What cannot be done directly cannot be allowed to be done

indirectly.

If the premises are very old, section 18 of the Rent Act provides

for demolition, and steps can be taken under the Rent Act.

If a building is in a ruinous state, section 60 of the Urban

Councils Ordinance, No.61 of 1939, as amended, empowers the

relevant Urban Council (not the Public Petitions Committees of

6

Provincial Councils) to take appropriate steps. Section 60 of the

Urban Councils Ordinance reads as follows:

If any house, building, boundary wall or gateway adjoining

any street or thoroughfare in any town, or anything affixed

thereon, be deemed by the Urban Council of that town to be

in a ruinous state, whether dangerous or not, or to be likely

to fall, the Council shall immediately, if it appears to be

necessary, cause a proper hoarding or fence to be put up for

the protection of persons using such street or thoroughfare,

and shall cause notice in writing to be served on the owner

or occupier forthwith to take down, secure, or repair such

house, building, boundary wall, gateway or thing affixed

thereon, as the case may require.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioners does not contend the Urban

Council cannot act under section 60 of the Urban Councils

Ordinance. Counsels argument is the Urban Council cannot

demolish the premises based on P7(b), i.e. the recommendation

of the Public Petitions Committee vide paragraph (e) of the

prayer to the petition.

The word ruinous used in section 60 is not defined in the

Urban Councils Ordinance. According to the Oxford Advanced

Learners Dictionary of Current English, the word ruinous is

defined as (of a town, building, etc.) destroyed or severely

damaged. The Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary

defines ruinous as causing great harm and destruction. The

Chambers 20th Century Dictionary defines the word ruinous as

fallen to ruins: decayed: bringing ruin: as of crashing (Military).

7

The Urban Council may, if it so desires, invoke the provisions of

section 60 independently. I hasten to add this section is not

meant to subvert justice and fair play or to circumvent the rigors

of the Rent Act. According to the Plan marked 12R10, the

building in suit is at least sixty-two years old. However, the

word ruinous in section 60 is not synonymous with very old.

Moreover, demolition is not the only option under this section.

The Urban Council can direct to take down [demolish], secure,

or repair such premises. This section shall, in my view, be

invoked to avert imminent danger to life and limb due to the

ruinous state of a building. It is predominantly for the purpose

of preventing impending danger that the legislature includes the

word forthwith in this section: shall cause notice in writing to

be served on the owner or occupier forthwith to take down,

secure, or repair such house, building, boundary wall, gateway or

thing affixed thereon, as the case may require. It is also relevant

to note that notice to demolish, secure or repair the building

shall be served on the owner or occupier. The fact that even an

occupant of a building, such as a tenant or licensee, can be

asked to demolish such a building forthwith, underscores that

section 60 is most applicable to a situation of grave danger and

urgency.

When taking the decision to demolish, secure or repair a

building, the Urban Council shall hear all relevant parties and

exercise its discretion reasonably and not arbitrarily, bearing in

mind considerations such as whether the premises are governed

by the Rent Act, as in the instant case.

8

Learned Counsel for the 12th Respondent vehemently submits

that recommendations are not amenable to writ jurisdiction.

Although this may have been the traditional view, administrative

law has developed to a stage where recommendations are now

amenable to writ jurisdiction, if such recommendations affect

the rights of citizens. Hence, I take the view the recommendation

in issue is subject to judicial review.

The recommendation of the Public Petitions Committee of the

Provincial Council is ultra vires and has no force or avail in law.

The preliminary objection raised by learned Counsel for the

Urban Council that the 1st-6th Respondent Members of the

Public Petitions Committee were not served with notice and

therefore the application shall be dismissed in limine is not

entitled to succeed. Notice was served on the said Respondents

several times by registered post, notwithstanding they are no

longer holding office.

I grant the Petitioners the reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (b)-

(e) and (h) of the prayer to the petition.

The application is allowed with costs.
