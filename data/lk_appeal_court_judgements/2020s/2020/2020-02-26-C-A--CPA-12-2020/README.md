HON. JUSTICE ACHALA WENGAPPULI,

This is an application to revise an order, made by the High Court of

Galle in case No. BA 155/2019 dated 14.01.2020, in refusing to enlarge the

Suspect-Respondent Anusha Shyamali Wewala Panditha on bail. She was

produced before the Magistrate's Court of Baddegama in case No. 737/2019

as a suspect for committing offences, which are punishable under Sections

54(a), (b) and (c) of Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended, in relation of more than 28 kg of Cannabis Sativa - L.

It is alleged that the Baddegama Police received information that a

group of persons who arrived in a car bearing No. KY 5632 had dumped

three bags near "Cheena Wella" which contained the prohibited substance

on 14.09.2019. The said vehicle had exited the Southern Expressway from

its Baddegama interchange and had failed to stop when signalled by the

Police at the said interchange. The said Car was seen during the relevant

2

time period, in CCTV footage that had been recovered from a public

school, which was located near the place where the three bags were found.

The Suspect-Respondent is the registered owner of the said Car and

was arrested on 15.09.2019, after she had evaded arrest by shifting her

residence to one of her relations. In her statement she had stated that she

had given her car on rent to one" Hichchi Malli". The Suspect-Respondent

claimed that she did not know any other personal details of the said

"Hichchi Malli" except for his mobile phone number 0729534610. This

number had been issued with international roaming facility and therefore

the local service provider is unable to trace the details of ownership of the

phone or of its subscriber.

In refusing to enlarge the Suspect-Respondent, the High Court has

held that the submissions made on her behalf as to the non-availability of

evidence in relation to her exclusive possession of the prohibited substance

is not relevant since it is a matter for the trial Court. It also considered the

time period the Suspect-Respondent has spent in remand pending

investigations and found that there is no exceptional ground revealed

therefrom. The fact that she is a mother of two children too was

disregarded as a non-exceptional ground.

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted to this

Court in support of the revision application that the Suspect-Respondent

was merely arrested because she is the registered owner of the said vehicle

and no other evidence is available as to her complicity even though the

investigations are continuing. Therefore, he reiterated that there is no basis

3

that she could be prosecuted successfully and that factor is an exceptional

ground to be considered in her favour.

The 1st and 2nd Respondents have resisted the application for

revision by filing objections.

Learned State Counsel invited attention of this Court that the

Petitioner had failed to make a full and truthful disclosure of the relevant

facts and circumstances, when she failed to mention that Suspect-

Respondent has another pending case in the Magistrate's Court of

Baddagama bearing Case No. B688/2018 and was on bail when she was

arrested in connection with the instant case.

She defended the impugned order of the High Court on the basis

that none of the grounds urged by the learned President's Counsel could

be considered as exceptional, a statutory requirement that had to be

fulfilled by a Petitioner, in seeking an order of Court for enlarging a

suspect or an accused under Section 54 (a) to (b) of the said Ordinance.

It is clear from the proceedings relating to the inquiry before the

High Court that the Suspect-Respondent had another pending case. The

Petitioner had failed to state that fact and the nature of the accusation in

Case No. B688/2018. It is the same Petitioner that had filed the Petition

supported by her affidavit before the High Court. In that Petition too, it

was erroneously stated that the make of the vehicle is Susuki, whereas the

vehicle that was involved with the instant detection is of Honda.

4

There is no explanation forthcoming from the Petitioner as to her

failure to state that the Suspect-Respondent had another pending case and

therefore it appears that there was in fact a suppression of a material fact.

In the impugned order, the High Court had considered the

applicable law and the judicial precedents relied upon by the Petitioner.

The High Court had distinguished those precedents and there were

no submissions made before this Court as to the correctness of the order in

that respect. The High Court, having considered the attendant

circumstances, concluded that the Petitioner had failed to satisfy it as to

the existence of any exceptional circumstances.

This Court concurs with the conclusion reached by the High Court

that there were no exceptional circumstances revealed before that Court.

Whether there is material to conclude the Suspect-Respondent was in

exclusive possession of the prohibited substance is not directly a relevant

consideration at this stage of the proceedings. It is undisputed that the

investigations are continuing.

As correctly submitted by the Learned State Counsel, the Petitioner's

application is clearly a premature one, considering all the circumstances of

this case.

5

Since there is no illegality or irregularity in the impugned order of

the High Court and in the absence of any exceptional circumstances that

exists in favour of the Petitioner in exercising revisionary jurisdiction of

this Court, the application of the Petitioner is ought to be rejected.

In view of the foregoing, the application of the Petitioner is refused

and her petition is accordingly dismissed without costs.

HON. JUSTICE DEVIKA ABEYRATNE

I agree.
