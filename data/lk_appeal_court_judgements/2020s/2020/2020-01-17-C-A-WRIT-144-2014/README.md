Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is the eldest son of Weerasekera Mudiyanselage Banda who was the

recipient of a grant (P2-A) issued under section 19(4) read with section 19(6) of the

Land Development Ordinance (Ordinance) to the state land called

"Baduelidamana" more fully depicted as No. 907 in the Final Colony Plan (Po) 13

Supplement 1. The 4th to 14th Respondents are his brothers and sisters.

The said Weerasekera Mudiyanselage Banda died on 24.02.2007 (P3-A) and his wife

M. Luwinona predeceased him on 28.06.2004 (P3-B). The dispute between the

Petitioner and the 4th to 14th Respondents is as to who is entitled to succeed to the

land forming the subject matter of the grant (P2-A) in terms of the Ordinance.

The 4th to the 14th Respondents claims that their father Weerasekera

Mudiyanselage Banda had informed the family that the 14th Respondent had been

nominated to succeed to the rights of the grant (P2-A) subject to the life interest of

the 4th Respondent. However, no evidence of such nomination is before Court. The

1't to 3rd Respondents did not file any objections. In any event, in terms of section

58(1) of the Ordinance a document (other than a last will) whereby the nomination

of a successor is effected or cancelled is not valid unless and until it has been

registered by the Registrar of Lands of the district in which the holding or land to

which that document refers is situated.

The Petitioner seeks two writs of mandamus, firstly directing the 1't, 2nd and 3rd

Respondents to name him as the successor to Weerasekera Mudiyanselage Banda

to the land depicted as No. 907 of the Final Colony Plan (Po) 13 Supplement 1

granted by land grant P2-A and to transfer/vest the title to such land to the

Petitioner and secondly directing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents to issue a land

grant to the Petitioner under section 19(4) of the Ordinance as amended to the

land depicted as No. 907 of the Final Colony Plan (Po) 13 Supplement l.

The Petitioner claims that he is, as the eldest son of Weerasekera Mudiyanselage

Banda, entitled to be the successor in terms of the Ordinance in the absence of a

nomination. Reliance is placed on section 72 of the Ordinance read with Rule 1 of

the Third Schedule to the Ordinance which sets out a list of relatives according to

priority in terms of which the eldest son gets preference. The 4th to 14th

Respondents did not dispute this legal position but submitted several grounds on

which they invited Court to refuse the relief prayed for by the Petitioner.

A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a Writ of

Mandamus is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as

a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has discretion to

deny him relief having regard to his unmeritorious conduct, suppression or

misrepresentation of material facts, delay, administrative inconvenience, waiver

and submission to jurisdiction. I wish to add that this is not an exhaustive list and

the Courts have from time to time developed other grounds on which this

discretionary relief can be refused .

The 4th to 14th Respondents state that the Petitioner consented in writing to the 3,d

Respondent that the rights to the grant P2-A can be divided between all the sons

of the deceased Weerasekera Mudiyanselage Banda. The Petitioner, at paragraph

11 of the petition, admits signing several documents on 02.01.2013 but claims that

it was done with the aim of transferring the land in dispute to him and that later he

realised it was for a different purpose. The Petitioner thereafter submitted an

affidavit dated 09.12.2013 (P-8) wherein he states that his consent to divide the

Page 5 of 12

land in dispute between all the sons of Weerasekera Mudiyanselage Banda was

given due to ignorance and claimed that he is withdrawing the said consent.

The Petitioner in the petition, at paragraph 11, states that he signed the document

at the request of the 3rd Respondent and was under the impression that it was to

facilitate the transfer of the land to the Petitioner based on his request to the 3rd

Respondent. He further states that he signed it without perusing the document.

This averment made presumably after receiving legal advice is different to the

averments in the previous affidavit P-8 and therefore I am reluctant to give full

credence to it.

The Petitioner sought in effect to place reliance on the defence non est factum

which can be invoked by a person who does not understand a document that he

has signed. This defence operates within narrow limits since if not it will be

detrimental to third parties who may rely to their detriment on the validity of a

signature contained in a document. A person who wishes to invoke the defence

must establish the following two points:

(1) He must establish that he was permanently or temporarily unable through

no fault of his own to have without explanation any real understanding of

the document he signed.

(2) He must show that there was a real or substantial difference between the

document which he signed and the document which he believed he was

signing.

The Petitioner in the affidavit P-8 does not make out a case in relation to either of

the above two points. All what he says is that he signed the document in ignorance.

Even if any credence is given to the contents of paragraph 11 of the petition it is

noted that the Petitioner states that he signed it without perusing the document.

The plea cannot be available to anyone who was content to sign without

taking the trouble to try to find out at least the general effect of the

document [Lord Reid in Saunders (executrix of the Will of Rose Maud Gallie, dec'd)

v. Anglia Building Society (1971) AC 1004]. A person will not be able to invoke the

defence of non est factum when he has been careless in signing the document or

has simply failed to read the document properly [United Dominions Trust Ltd. v.

Western B.S. Romanau (1976) QB 513]. In such a case the party signing the

document is bound by his signature.

Accordingly, I hold that the Petitioner has consented to the land been divided

between the sons of the deceased grantee and therefore is not entitled to any relief

from this Court.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner sought to argue that since section 72 of the

Ordinance specifies the order of succession in the absence of a nomination, a

settlement/agreement in the form entered into by the Petitioner cannot stand in

law. I disagree since there is no statutory prohibition on a person who is entitled in

terms of the rules of succession in the absence of a nomination from agreeing to

divide the land in dispute between his siblings.

The learned counsel for the Petitioner further sought to argue that the Petitioner

has a legitimate expectation of being recognised as the successor since the 3rd

Respondent promised the Petitioner that he would proceed to transfer the entire

land to the Petitioner.

This representation was made after the Petitioner sought to withdraw from the

earlier consent, he had given to divide the land between the five sons of the

deceased grantee by tendering the affidavit P-8.

I have explained earlier that in law it is not possible for the Petitioner to have

withdrawn from the consent he had given on the grounds urged by him. The

principle that the court will not give effect to a legitimate expectation where to do

so would involve the decision-maker acting contrary to law is fundamental

[Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu [1983] 2 AC 629 at 638; R. v. North

and East Devon Health Authority, Ex parte Coughlan (2000) 2 WLR 622 at 647,651,

656; R v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, Ex parte Begbie (2000)

1 WLR 1115 at 1125, 1132)].

In Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) Ltd. vs. Director General of Customs [(2005) BLR

24] the Supreme Court held that the representation must be intra vires for there to

be a legitimate expectation.

Therefore, I hold that the Petitioner did not have a legitimate expectation of being

recognised as the successor to the deceased grantee.

There is also a further point which prevents the Petitioner from obtaining writs of

mandamus as prayed for in the petition against the 1st to 3rd Respondents as they

have been sued nominee officii or in other words are not legal persons.

In Haniffa v. The Chairman, Urban Council, Nowalapitiya (66 N.L.R. 48) Thambiah J.

stated that mandamus can only issue against a natural person, who holds a public

office. In Samarasinghe v. De Mel and Another [(1982) 1 SrLL.R. 123 at 128] this

Court quoted with approval Haniffa's judgment as follows:

"The petitioner's application is beset with other difficulties as well. The

petitioner has made W. L. P. de Mel, Commissioner of Labour, the

respondent to his application. It is common ground that he has now ceased

to hold this post and is presently the Secretary, Ministry of Trade. The

petitioner has not sought to substitute the present holder of the office. A

Mandamus can only issue against a natural person, who holds a public office.

If such a person fails to perform a duty after he has been ordered by Court,

he can be punished for contempt of Court. (See, Haniffa v. The Chairman, U.

C. Nawalapitiya, 66 NLR 48). Before this Court issues a Mandamus, it must

be satisfied that the respondent will in fact be able to comply with the

order and that in the event of non-compliance, the Court is in a position to

enforce obedience to its order. Mandamus will not, in general, issue to

compel a respondent to do what is impossible in law or in fact. Thus, it will

not issue ............... to require one who is functus officio to do what he was

formally obliged to do." (de Smith, 2nd Edn. 581). So, it seems to me, that

even if the petitioner's application succeeded, the issue of a Mandamus

would be futile." (emphasis added)

Haniffa's judgment was again quoted with approval by this Court in Abayadeera

and 162 Others v. Dr. Stanely Wijesundera, Vice Chancel/or, University of Colombo

and Another [(1983) 2 Sri.L.R. 267]. In Dayaratne v. Rajitha Senaratne, Minister of

Lands and Others [(2006) 1 Sri.L.R. 7] the Petitioner sought to rely on the Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 to support his argument that an

application for writ of mandamus can be maintained against a public office without

naming the holder of the office. Marsoof J. (at page 17) disagreed with this

contention and said that " ... this being an application for mandamus, relief can only

be obtained against a natural person who holds a public office as was decided by

the Supreme Court in Haniffa v. Chairman, Urban Council, Nawalapitiya"

(emphasis added).

The learned counsel for the Petitioner relied on Rule 5(2) in part IV of the Court of

Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 which states that a public officer may be

made a respondent to any application made in terms of Article 140 of the

Constitution by reference to his official designation only and not by name.

However, it is to be noted that the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules

1990 applies to all applications under Articles 140 and 141 of the Constitution and

therefore is general in nature. The rule that in an application for a writ of

mandamus the Respondent should be either a natural or a legal person is specific

in nature. The difference between the remedies of certiorari and mandamus was

adverted to in Shums v. People's Bank and others [(1985) 1 Sri.L.R. 197 at 204] by

this Court as follows:

"The other cases relied on by learned State Counsel were all cases where

writs of Mandamus had been applied for. In A. C. M. Haniffa v. Chairman,

Urban Council, Nawalapitiya (8), it was held that "A Mandamus can only issue

Page 10 of 12

against a natural person who holds a public office: Accordingly in an

application for a writ of Mandamus against the Chairman, Urban Council, the

petitioner must name the individual person against whom the writ can

issue". The judgment in that case gives a reason why a Mandamus can only

issue against a natural person, who holds a public office when it says that "If

such a person fails to perform a duty after he has been ordered by Court, he

can be punished for contempt of Court". On, the other hand in the case of a

writ of Certiorari, what this court does is to bring up a decision or

determination of a statutory Tribunal or a functionary and quash it. Once

such a decision or determination is quashed, it ceases to exist and a fresh

decision or determination would have to be made if the matter is again

proceeded with. The tribunal or functionary is not enjoined to do anything

or desist from doing anything, the question of non-compliance with such

Orders resulting in contempt of court does not arise. Therefore, it would be

seen that the remedy by way of writ of Certiorari could not be equated to

one of Mandamus as far as the effect on the parties is concerned ."

In Chandana v. Commissioner General of Examinations and Others [CA. (Writ)

Application No. 1/2008, CAM. 06.06.2014] Nalin Perera J. (as he was then) held

that a writ of mandamus will not issue against a person sued nominee officii.

The Supreme Court in Gnanasambanthan v. Rear Admiral Perera and Others

[(1998) 3 Sri.L.R. 169] was called upon to consider the necessary parties to an

application for writs of certiorari and mandamus and Amerasinghe J. held (at page

171):

Page 11 of 12

"In any event the question before us is not whether the Chairman of REPIA

could be cited nominee officii, which perhaps was possible in respect of the

application for Certiorari but not in respect of the application of

Mandamus ... " (emphasis added)

A Writ of Mandamus could only issue against a natural person, who holds public

office [Mahanayake v. Chairman, Ceylan Petroleum Corporation and Others (2005)

2 Sri.L.R. 193].

There is also the issue of delay on the part of the Petitioner. The father of the

Petitioner died in 2007 whereas this application was filed in 2014. It is true that the

Petitioner made an application on 21.06.2012 (P-4) to the 3rd Respondent seeking

a transfer of the land in dispute to him. However, this was more than five years

after the death of his father. The Petitioner has failed to explain this delay.

For all the foregoing reasons, the application is dismissed without costs.
