ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The accused-appellant was convicted for murder of Liyanapedige

Tillakaratna on 09.04.2000 at Akbowa of Bandarawatta by the High Court of Kegalle

with its judgment dated 22.05.2014 and sentenced to death. Being aggrieved by

the said conviction and sentence, the accused-appellant preferred the instant

appeal seeking intervention of this Court to have them set aside.

The case presented by the prosecution against the accused-appellant is

based on circumstantial evidence. The only lay witness who testified for the

prosecution as to the conduct of the accused-appellant, prior to the death of the

deceased, is one Dharma Kumara, who ran a tea boutique in the village. He knew

the deceased, as well as the accused-appellant, quite well. Referring to the events

that took place prior to his learning of the death of the deceased, the witness said

that the accused-appellant, when he saw the deceased walking along the road,

muttered that " (!3~ lCl c)zClo) ':;o!llC)" and attributed a reason for his

intended action by stating that the deceased had" Cl O)C) 0)" ~Clo) 9l" . At

that time the accused-appellant was having some hoppers at his boutique.

Thereafter, at about 5.30 in the same evening, the witness again saw the

deceased walking along a ridge of the nearby paddy field. He also saw the

accused- appellant following the deceased. The accused- appellant carried a katty

with a long neck, identified as one similar to "PI" at that point of time. The

witness had seen the accused thereafter only in Court.

"

During cross-examination of this witness, a contradiction was sought to be

marked off his evidence by the learned Counsel for the accused appellant, upon

the witness's evidence before the trial Court that the said utterance was made by

the accused appellant in the morning at about 7.30 or 8.00, whereas to the Police,

the witness has said that it was in the evening at about 4.00 or 4.30 only the

accused-appellant has come to his boutique to have some hoppers. The witness,

being reminded of what he said to Police, thereafter corrected himself that is the

correct time and this lapse in his testimony was due to his fading memory.

Witness Jayatillaka said in evidence that he learnt about his father's death,

at about 6.30 a.m., in the following morning, on his way to work.

Post mortem examination of the deceased was conducted by Dr.

Gangodawila, who testified that the deceased had suffered three cut injuries. The

1st injury was on the right side of his neck, which was 3 inches deep, cutting into

cervical vertebra, neck muscles, spinal cord and blood vessels, that supplied

blood to the brain. The medical expert was of the opinion that this injury could

be termed as necessarily a fatal injury. The said injury may have been caused by

a weapon similar to the katty marked as PI, by attacking with considerable force,

as it is a heavy sharp cutting weapon.

51 Tibbatumunuwa of Alawwa Police investigated and arrested the accused-

appellant at his home town Giriulla, some distance away from the scene of the

incident at IlukeWatta in Agobowa, Alawwa. After his arrest, statement of the

accused-appellant was recorded by the witness. A katty with a long neck (PI)

was recovered upon being shown by the accused-appellant, from his temporary

3

"

abode at Agobowa, Alawwa, close to the place where the deceased suffered his

fatal injury,

During cross-examination, it was elicited that the accused-appellant was

arrested upon information provided by a private informant of the witness. That

informant is identified as "Nuwan", who operates a boutique shop. The witness

did not record his statement, but only made a note in the pocket note book. He

admitted in cross examination that he was unaware as to the contents of the said

informant's statement.

During the hearing of the appeal, learned Counsel for the accused-

appellant sought to challenge the validity of the conviction on the following

grounds of appeal;

a. the prosecution presented its case on the basis of last seen theory but

the trial Court failed to consider the failure of the prosecution to

establish time of death of the deceased, and relied on hearsay material

in determining the said issue,

b. the trial Court erred in applying the legal principles in relation to

Section 27 recovery,

c. the trial Court failed to appreciate that the items of circumstantial

evidence that had been relied upon by the prosecution are not weighty

enough to sustain a conviction for murder,

d. the trial Court erred in shifting burden of proof on the accused-

appellant.

4

.'

In support of her 1st ground of appeal, learned Counsel for the accused-

appellant contended that in view of the reasoning of the judgment of The King v

Appuhamy 46 NLR 128, it was incumbent upon the prosecution to "fix the exact

time of death of the deceased" and in this instance, there was no such evidence led

before the trial Court by the prosecution. It was contended that the trial Court

had failed to consider the items of circumstantial evidence on this aspect, in the

light of the principle enunciated in the said judgment, and therefore the

conviction entered against the accused-appellant could not be sustained.

The above reproduced part of the judgment of the Court of Criminal

Appeal in The King v Appuhamy (ibid) that" the prosecution failed to fix the exact

time of the death of the deceased, and the fact that the deceased was last seen in the

company of the accused loses a considerable part of its significance" was expressed by

their Lordships because in said appeal "the presence of rice and curry in the stomach

of the deceased also indicates a strong possibility that the death took place some hours

after the deceased set out with the accused".

The underlying principle of the last seen theory referred to by the Court of

Criminal Appeal was elaborated by the Supreme Court of India in the judgment

of State a/Uttar Pradesh v Satish [2005 (3) SCC 114] as follows;

"The last seen theory comes into play where the time gap between

the point of time when the accused and the deceased were seen last

alive and when the deceased is found dead is so small that

possibility of any person other than the accused being the author of

the crime becomes impossible."

5

.'

Their Lordships have further added that;

"It would be difficult in some cases to positively establish that the

deceased was last seen with the accused when there is a long gap

and possibility of other persons coming in between exits. In the

absence of any other positive evidence to conclude that the accused

and the deceased were last seen together, it would be hazardous to

come to a conclusion of guilt on those cases."

It is in the light of the said principle; this Court must consider the merits of

this particular ground of appeal, as contended by the accused-appellant.

The evidence is, by 6.30 a.m. on the following morning, the body of the

deceased was already discovered, lying in a ditch with cut injury on his neck. The

medical evidence indicate that the deceased's stomach contained some liquid

smelling of liquor. It was the opinion of the medical officer that it would take

about 2 hours after consuming a liquid for it to empty itself from the stomach.

This confirms the fact that the deceased was killed within two hours of him

consuming that liquid, smelling of liquor.

The deceased was last seen alive at about 5.30 p.m. on 09.04.2000. His body

was discovered lying in close proximity to the place he was last seen walking.

The blood marks on the stony path and the nature of injuries indicate that he

succumbed to his injuries, where he had sustained them. In considering the

relative probabilities of these circumstances, one probability is that the deceased,

having walked passed the place where he was attacked, followed by the accused

appellant, returned to the same spot once again, after some time and only at that

6

.'

point of time his assailant had attacked him. The other probability is that the

deceased received the injuries, which caused his death, soon after he was spotted

by the witness, who saw him being closely followed by the accused appellant

who had a katty similar to the one marked as Pl. The exact time of the utterance

attributed to the accused appellant becomes very relevant in the circumstances.

The witness had corrected himself, when confronted with the fact that he told

police that it was at about 4.00 or 4.30 in the afternoon. At that time the deceased

was walking past his boutique and he continued on his journey. After about one

hour since that incident, the witness, whilst on his way to some place on his

motor cycle, casually saw the deceased walking along a ridge, followed by the

accused-appellant, who was carrying a katty.

The deep cut injury on the neck of the deceased could have been caused by

such weapon and it appears that the accused appellant had exclusive knowledge

of the place where one such weapon could be found, when considered in the light

of the fact that he was arrested far away from the place of the incident only on the

following day evening, but had knowledge of the place where the weapon was.

The stomach contents, which was still in the stomach of the deceased

indicate that he had died within two hours after consuming it. If the deceased

had consumed that liquid soon after he had gone past the witness Dharma

Kumara's boutique at 4/4.30 p.m., and was killed within a short period of time

after 5.30 p.m., then the two-hour period would not render the case for the

prosecution an improbable one. This is only in respect of the two-hour period as

estimated by the medical witness.

7

.'

But the prosecution had placed many other items of circumstantial

evidence which were referred to in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment.

HQI Nanayakkara has visited the scene. According to him the body was

lying near a canal, which runs along the boundary of the paddy field. He also

noted blood splashes along the stony path. The body was discovered close to the

place where the witness Dharma Kumara saw the deceased alive for the last time.

Witness Dharma Kumara saw the accused-appellant following the deceased

with a distance of 50 meters, along the ridge at about 5.30 p.m. carrying a katty.

Hence, although the time gap that exists between the time the deceased was last

seen in the company of the accused-appellant and the time of discovery of his

death is about 13 hours, when the other factors are considered in its totality, they

would sustain an inference that it was the accused appellant who inflicted the

injuries and no other.

Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant complained that the

"informant" referred to in the evidence of 51 Tibbatumunuwa is in fact witness

Dharma Kumara and his statement was not recorded by the Police. His claim of

seeing the accused- appellant following the deceased and the utterances

attributed to the accused appellant, becomes unreliable since he acted as an

informant.

This contention finds no support from the evidence presented before the

trial Court. When the witness was cross-examined as to the time the said

utterance was made, learned Counsel for the accused-appellant referred to the

8

.'

relevant portion from his statement to Police by recitation what he told. This

establishes there is in fact a statement made by the witness. In relation to his

credibility, witness Jayatillaka, in his evidence testified that when he went to

Police to inform the death of his father, it was witness Dharma Kumara who

accompanied him. The fact that the accused-appellant was considered as the

suspect for the murder of the deceased, soon after the 1st information is received

by Police could be inferred fron the evidence of both official witnesses HQI

Nanayakkara and SI Tibbatumunuwa. This justifies the conclusion drawn by the

trial Court that Dharma Kumara conveyed what he saw and heard to Police at the

first available opportunity.

In its judgment, the trial Court had devoted considerable space in

evaluating the evidence in the light of the principle of last seen theory as laid

down in judicial precedents.

In these circumstances, the mere failure of the prosecution to lead evidence

as to the exact time of death will not accrue to the benefit of the accused-appellant

since the direct evidence referred to above indicate that the prosecution has

established" ... that possibility of any person other than the accused being the author of

the crime becomes impossible." The evidence considered by this Court in the

preceding paragraph are undoubtedly direct evidence and not hearsay as the

accused-appellant contends. Therefore, this ground of appeal raised by the

accused-appellant necessarily fails.

The complaint of misapplication of the principles in relation to discovery of

facts under Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance by the accused-appellant has no

9

.'

valid basis since the trial Court had correctly attributed only the knowledge of

the place, where PI was found, on him.

This Court, in the judgment of Kusumadasa v Attorney General (2011) 1 Sri

L.R. 240, laid down the applicable principles where the prosecution is seeking to

prove the guilt of an accused through items of circumstantial evidence. The trial

Court, having identified the several items of circumstantial evidence, has acted

on those principles in coming to the conclusion that the prosecution has

established its case beyond reasonable doubt since these items only point to his

guilt and not his innocence.

The accused-appellant's last ground of appeal that the trial Court has

shifted burden of proof on him, should be considered at this stage. It was

contended that the trial Court erred when it misapplied the Ellenborough principle.

The impugned portion of the judgment reads " ~@~ CloSClClOl@(3) CloC;ClleioSClo

Clo co1Cil Q)Cl @o~Cl.!ll ClOltl!! Qo OlcogOl Cl.!ll ClClCl CloSClClOl Cl8~ OlG)lOtl!J

olcoi~@ CilOci @.!lllClO.!ll ClClCl CloSClClOl ClOC;ClOl Q)ClCl (!Jog Cl.!ll Q)Cl ~~ @o~

013" .

In Kusumadasa v Attorney General(ibid) it was stated that;

"To apply the dictum of Lord Ellenborough it is incumbent on the

prosecution to put forward a strong prima facie case against the

accused. When the prosecution has not put forward a strong prima

facie case the dictum of Lord Ellenborough cannot be applied.

Dictum of Lord Ellenborough cannot be used to give life to a weak

case put forward by the prosecution. I therefore hold that in the

instant case dictum of Lord Ellenborough cannot be applied."

10

.'

Thus, it is amply clear that the trial Court, having correctly concluded that

the prosecution has established a prima facie case against the accused- appellant,

commented on his failure to offer an acceptable explanation. This, the trial Court

is entitled to do, since the prosecution has established a strong case based on

circumstantial evidence against the accused-appellant by proving, his motive,

that he had the opportunity and the weapon to inflict the fatal wound, coupled

with his subsequent conduct of evading arrest by shifting residence to his

village.

This Court is of the considered view that the grounds of appeal that are

relied upon by the accused-appellant are without merit. His conviction and

sentence is accordingly affirmed.

The appeal of the accused-appellant is therefore dismissed.
