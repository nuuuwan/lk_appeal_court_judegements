This is a Revision Application for Bail filed by the Petitioner in terms of Article 138 of the

Constitution read with Section 364 and 404 of the Criminal Procedure Code Act No.IS of 1979.

The Petitioner in this case has filed this revision application to revise the order of the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo dated 06.04.2019 in Bail Application No: HC Colombo 26118

refusing to enlarge the petitioner on bail. The instant order is concerned with, whether the

Petitioner is entitled to be enlarged on Bail under exceptional circumstances.

Facts of the Case:

The petitioner was arrested with two others on or about 23.0S.20 16 within the jurisdiction of

Grandpass Police for being in possession and for trafficking of ISl.60g of Diacetyl morphine

(Pure Heroin). The petitioner along with two others were arrested while they were travelling in a

cab (car). The second suspect tried to escape nevertheless the police caught him. At the time of

arrest the driver of the cab stated that he was only the driver of cab (car) belongs to the taxi

service company named 'NAMDO'.

The government analyst report dated 23.08.2016 relating to productions of this matter revealed

that the pure quantity of Diacetyl morphine was ISI.6g. The petitioner was indicted in the High

and S4A (c) of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act no.13 of

1984.

The second suspect was released on bail by the order of the Learned Magistrate of Maligakanda

dated 18.07.2018. The Petitioner had filed a Bail application bearing No. HC Colombo 26118 and

the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo had refused to grant bail on the basis that there were

no exceptional circumstances.

Being aggrieved by the said dismissal, the petitioner preferred a revision application to this

Court.

In his Petition, the petitioner has submitted the following grounds as exceptional circumstances;

I. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration that the medical

condition coupled with long incarceration constitutes an exceptional ground for the

court to grant bail pending trial.

2. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration that no previous

convictions or pending cases regarding drug related offences.

3. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to record the grounds on which the bail

application was made.

4. The order of the Learned High Court Judge is against the presumption of innocence.

5. The difficulty of the petitioner in a prison environment post-surgery.

Section 83 (I) of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs (amendment] Act No. I3 of 1984,

reads as follows:

"'No person sU5pected or accused of an offence under section 54A or section 54B of this

Ordinance shall be released on bail, except by the High Court in exceptional

circumstances. "

In the case of Lunumoderage Nishanthi v. AG ICA (PHC) APN 48/2014], it was held that,

"'It is trite law that any accused or suspect having charged under the above act will be

admilled to bail only in terms of section 83(1) of the said Act and it is only on

Exceptional circumstances. Nevertheless it is intensely relevant to note, the term

"exceptional circumstances" has not been explained or defined in any of the Statutes.

Page 3 of 5

Judges are given a wide discretion in deciding in what creates a circumstance which is

exceptional in nature ... "

According to Section 83 of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs [amendment] Act No. 13 of

1984, the intention of the legislature can be construed as to keep the suspects under the said Act,

in remand unless exceptional circumstances are demonstrated.

It is brought to the attention of the court that the Petitioner who is presently in the remand

custody is said to have been in remand since 23.05.2016. Court notes that the petitioner has been

in remand over a period of 3 years and the petitioner has no previous convictions or pending

cases with regard to drug related offences.

The Leamed Counsel for the Petitioner contended that the Petitioner is a heart patient of a

serious condition for which he is instructed to undergo a surgery. Moreover, the Learned High

Court Judge in his orders dated 13/1/2020, 30/1/2020 and 27/2/2020 has directed the relevant

prison authorities to take steps to take the petitioner to the National Hospital of Colombo in order

to carry out his treatments in which the prison authorities have yet failed to comply with the said

order. Further it was noted that the prison authorities were unable to carry out the orders of the

Learned High Court Judge on 30/1/2020 and 27/2/2020. Medical reports of the cardiologist

revealed that 70% of mid vessel is blocked and recommended intervention.

In the case of CA (PHC) APN 64/2009 (decided on 07.08.2009) W.L.R. Silva, J held that,

" ... If an accused cannot assign exceptional circumstances he will have to be kept on

remand and when an accused had been on remand for 03 years because he had no

exceptional circumstances will that by itself constitute exceptional circumstances. If that

is treated as an exceptional circumstance, in my view it would be an anomaly because the

facts that there aren 't any exceptional circumstances finally mature into exceptional

circumstances. The fact that he had no exceptional circumstances becomes a

qualification after 03 years. If that was the intention of the legislature, the section itself

would have stated the exceptional circumstances should not be insisted after 03 years

and there is no such qualification, no such jurisdiction found in the particular provision

dealing with bail. In any case, if the period of incarceration is out of a provision and

depending on the nature of the charges the Court of course can consider on certain

Page 4 of 5

circumstances the long period of incarceration as constituting an exceptional

circumstances ... "

In light of above it is understood that even though the period of remand cannot be considered

alone as an exceptional circumstance, it constitutes an exceptional circumstance when a long

period of remand is coupled with such other medical conditions. In the instant case the Accused

Petitioner needs immediate medical attention and if not his life may be in danger.

Therefore, after considering above mentioned facts this court is of the view that the ends of

justice will be met by enlarging the suspect on bail.

The Accused Petitioner is enlarged on bail under stringent conditions as follows:

I. Cash bail of Rupees Five Hundred Thousand (Rs. 500,000/=)

2. Surety bail of Rupees Two Million (Rs. 2,000,000/=) each, with two sureties acceptable

to the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

3. The Accused Petitioner is ordered to report to the Police Narcotics Bureau Colombo 01

on every Sunday of each month between 8.30 am to 12.30 pm.

4. Not to intervene or threaten the witnesses.

5. To hand over the Passport or any other travel document to the relevant High Court

6. Not to apply for a new Passport or any travel document.

In case, if the Accused Petitioner violates any of the bail conditions mentioned above, he will be

remanded until final determination of the case.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of the bail order to the High Court Judge of Colombo,

Controller General of the Department ofImmigration and Emigration and the Prison Authorities.
