ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The 1st accused-appellant Oftalie Velaudhan Sunil Lal (hereinafter referred to

as the Appellant) was indicted by the Hon. Attorney General, along with the 2nd

accused Geethani Dhammika Dharmaratne, before the High Court of Colombo. It

was alleged in the said indictment, as its first count, that the Appellant had

imported 2257.4 grams of Heroin during the period 28.04.2004 and 30.04.2004, an

offence punishable under Section 54A(d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984. The second count was that

the Appellant and the 2nd accused have conspired to traffic in the said quantity of

Heroin, while the third count alleged that they attempt to traffic in the said

quantity of Heroin.

Trial proceeded against both accused on their entering a plea of not guilty.

At the closure of the prosecution's case and when the trial Court ruled that the

2

Appellant and the 2nd accused had a case to answer, both of them gave evidence

under oath, in addition to calling witnesses on their behalf.

The prosecution alleged that it is the Appellant who is involved in the

importation of a rice pounder machine from a Company located in India. The

Certificate of Origin ("P3") pertaining to the shipment of the said pounding

machine indicated it was to be shipped on board Merchant Vessel Orient Success

from the port of Cochin in India. It also indicates that the consignee is "Aloy Expo

(Pvt) Ltd., of 9SC, Averiwatta Road, Wattala". The Bill of Lading dated 15.04.2004

("P5") too is in the name of the said consignee and it bears confirmation that the

consignment was "Shipped On Board" on 15.04.2004. By an email ("PT), the

Indian Shipping agency had amended the name of the consignee as Geetani

Dhammika Dharmaratna of 55/7, St Anthony's Mawatha, Colombo 3, the 2nd accused

before the High Court. The Cargo Arrival Notice ("P6"), Invoice ("P9"), Delivery

Order ("P8"), Value Declaration to Sri Lanka Customs ("Pll"), were all in the

name of the 2nd accused as the consignee of the pounding machine.

When the machine had reached Colombo via sea freight, both the

Appellant and 2nd accused have submitted themselves to the Customs procedure

and paid the relevant customs duties in order to secure the release of the

machine into their possession. During further investigations carried out on the

machine, it was revealed that Heroin was concealed in four stainless pipes fitted

into it. The Appellant during his cross examination admitted that it was he who

imported the pounding machine. The Appellant during his cross examination

also admitted that heroin was detected concealed in the said machine that was

imported.

3

In delivering the impugned judgment on 14.06.2012, the High Court had

found the Appellant guilty only to the 1st and 3rd counts. The 2nd accused was

acquitted from the 2nd and 3rd counts. The Appellant too was acquitted of the 2nd

count. The Appellant was sentenced to death upon conviction on both these

counts.

Being aggrieved by his conviction and sentence, the Appellant preferred

an appeal and at the hearing, learned President's Counsel who represented him

had presented submissions on the broader and general ground of appeal that he

was deprived of a fair trial. As the learned President's Counsel proceeded along

with his submission, he had itemised several factors upon which he founded his

ground of appeal. In support of these factors, it was contended that;

a. the trial Court had failed to properly consider the relative probabilities

of the version of events as presented by the prosecution,

b. the trial Court had failed to properly consider the inconsistent and

contradictory evidence of the prosecution in determining its credibility.

Learned President's Counsel, in elaborating the grounds of appeal based

on the probability of the prosecution version of events, posed the question

whether it is more probable for the Appellant, if he knew that Heroin was

concealed in the machine, to abscond rather than to present himself voluntarily

at the Customs to complete the clearance procedure and thereupon to face the

consequences. He also contended that the trial Court had failed to consider the

said probability of the prosecution version, in the light of the Appellant's

assertion that it was not the machine he had imported from the Indian supplier.

4

,

In support of the second ground of appeal, it was submitted by the learned

President's Counsel that following inconsistencies that exist in the prosecution, if

taken cumulatively, would at least render the evidence of the prosecution

witnesses unsafe to act upon;

a. the inconsistency as to the number of days the officers have attempted

to trace the pounding machine among the other consignments received

by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority,

b. the inconsistency as to the exact date on which the Appellant had

presented himself at the Customs,

c. the inconsistency that exists as to the day on which the pounding

machine was imported and the date specified in the indictment alleging

the importation,

d. the inconsistency in the description of the machine as spoken to by the

prosecution witnesses and also as to the vessel in which it had arrived,

whether it was mounted on a palette or in a crate,

e. the inconsistencies that exists in the evidence of the detecting officers as

to the circumstances under which they detected and identified Heroin

at the Lathe Shop,

f. the inconsistencies that exists in the evidence as to the Appellant's

conduct at the point on which Heroin was detected, whether he made a

confession, or did a demonstration for the benefit of the witnesses to

easily release the Heroin concealed in the stainless tubes,

g. the inconsistency as to the reference number of investigations,

h. the inconsistency as to when the weighing of the Heroin was done.

5

In relation to the contention that the trial Court had failed to properly

consider the relative probabilities of the version of events as presented by the

prosecution, learned President's Counsel contended that if the Appellant, as the

prosecution claims, had knowingly imported the Heroin concealed in the

pounding machine, then is it probable for him to get personally involved with

the process of clearing at the Customs, in view of the dire consequences such an

engagement would undoubtedly ensue.

Learned Senior State Counsel, in his reply contended that it is a risk that

exists during entire process of importation, since any imported consignment

must pass through Customs for clearing. He further submitted that the

possibility identified by the learned President's Counsel only arises if the

Appellant had a reason to believe that his ploy to import a large quantity of

Heroin, concealed in a machine, was already known to the authorities at the time

of clearing. He contended that the Appellant had no knowledge of the discovery

of his importation of Heroin at that particular point of time.

In the judgment, the trial Court had considered the credibility of each

prosecution witness against the positions that had been advanced through cross

examination by the Appellant. The evidence of the prosecution is clear that the

information of the concealed Heroin, was known only to the officers who were

tasked to investigate that information and their superiors. Mere shifting of the

item from the warehouse of Sri Lanka Ports Authority under Sri Lanka Customs

is not known to the Appellant. This is indicative from the evidence that the

Appellant and the 2nd accused have come to Sri Lanka Customs and had secured

the services of a Wharf Clerk on their advice to help them with the generally

complicated Customs procedure in clearing goods.

6

The prosecution repeatedly clarified from its witnesses whether the

Appellant or the 2nd accused were not excited at any point of time during the

clearing. Even when the Appellant and the 2nd accused were accompanied to the

warehouse after payment of Customs duty for them to identify the item for

clearing, there was no unusual behaviour that had been attributed to the

Appellant. The prosecution, the Appellant as well as the 2nd accused admitted

that they had identified the pounding machine, which contained Heroin, whilst

at the Customs warehouse. That is the point at which the two Customs Officers

had commenced their investigation upon the information they had received. The

Officers assert that without a proper identification and making claim to the

imported items by the importer, they would not be able to proceed with that

particular inquiry. The "coercion" on the Wharf Clerk by the two Customs

Officers, apparently had not been conveyed to the Appellant, putting him on his

guard hinting that his scheme had been discovered.

In considering these factors, this Court is not inclined to accept that the

probability of the prosecution version of events is not adversely affected in any

manner due to this factor. This ground of appeal therefore had no merits.

Learned President's Counsel had placed more reliance on the other

grounds of appeal, as indicated by his repeated emphasis on them. Of these

several grounds as urged by the Counsel for the Appellant, almost all of them are

centred around the issue of credibility of the prosecution witnesses and its lapses

in presenting the case against the Appellant, except to the one concerning the

date of importation as specified in the indictment and "actual date of

importation". Therefore, it is proposed to consider the complaint by the

Appellant that the date of importation as reflected in the indictment and the

evidence presented by the prosecution on the date of importation, which 7

obviously indicate two contradictory time periods, and therefore whether the

prosecution had failed to prove its allegation of importation, at the very outset of

this judgment.

This particular ground of appeal demands that this Court determines the

issue whether the conclusion reached by the trial Court was justified or not, in

view of this particular inconsistency in the light of the prosecution evidence as to

the date and time of the importation of the pounding machine. In order to

determine that issue, this Court then must undertake an exercise by which it

determines, as far as Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance is concerned, what it meant by the word "import" and how the

effective date and time of importation should also be determined. In other

words, this Court was to provide a definition to the word "import" in Section

54A, which would include as to when the act of importation is completed, since

the Legislature did not provide one as it did with the two other offences namely

"manufacturing" and "trafficking in" of a dangerous drugs.

The indictment alleged that the Appellant had imported the specified

quantity of Heroin during the time period 28.04.2004 and 30.04.2004. It was

pointed out by the learned President's Counsel that there is evidence of the

prosecution witnesses that, in fact the pounding machine did arrive in Sri Lanka

on 17.04.2004 and the information on Heroin was conveyed on 21.04.2004 but the

Appellant presented himself to the Customs only on the 28.04.2004. It was

therefore contended by the learned President's Counsel that the machine

containing Heroin was already imported to Sri Lanka on a date very much prior

to the date of alleged importation by the Appellant.

8

Section 54A(c) of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance had

made illegal import or export of any dangerous drug as a punishable offence.

Even though the Legislature defined the words "traffic" and "manufacture" that

constitute distinct offences, it did not however provide any such definition to the

words "import or export" contained in the said Section.

In Attorney General v Kumarasinghe (1995) 2 Sri L.R. 1, this Court

considered the question whether a passenger, who possessed 40 gold pieces in

the transit lounge of the Bandaranaike International Airport, had "imported"

them in to Sri Lanka without a permit, in violation of Section 21(1) of the

Exchange Control Act. The said passenger had arrived Sri Lanka from Singapore

and was waiting in the transit lounge en route to Male. This Court, having noted

that the ordinary meaning of "import" is to "bring from abroad", however,

adopted the definition provided for "import" in Section 22 of the Imports and

Exports Control Act No. 1 of 1969, where it states that ""import" with its

grammatical variations and cognate expressions when used in relation to any good means

the importing or bringing into Sri Lanka, or causing to be bought into Sri Lanka whether

by sea or by air of such goods" to rule that the appellant had in fact "imported"

gold.

This judicial precedent on importation has no applicability to the instant

appeal since it could clearly be distinguished on two aspects. In Attorney

General v Kumarasinghe (ibid), the concern was that the appellant had

committed a Customs/Revenue offence. Hence the applicability of the definition

provided in the Exchange Control Act. In this instance, however, the offence of

importation is created by Section 54A(c) of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance. This Statute states that prohibited dangerous drugs could only

be imported " ... in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter" or upon a licence

9

issued by the Director of Health Services. Therefore, it appears that any act of

importation of a dangerous drug is governed by provisions of Poisons Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance and therefore the provisions of Customs

Ordinance or of the Exchange Control Act has no applicability in the context of

Section 54A(c) of Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

In addition, the said precedent could be distinguished on factual

considerations as well. The evidence before their Lordships was that the

appellant was physically carrying the quantity of gold when he was detected

whilst waiting in the transit lounge of the airport. Thus, with the arrival of the

carrier (the appellant) to Sri Lanka, the quantity of gold, being in his immediate

personal possession, too was simultaneously brought into Sri Lanka. In the

instant appeal, the physical possession of the pounding machine had transferred

from several entities and individuals, which were involved with its

transportation throughout its journey across the seas until it finally claimed by

the Appellant and the 2nd accused with their act of surrendering the necessary

shipping documents to the Customs on 28.04.2004 for its clearing. However, a

consignment to Sri Lanka aboard a sea vessel, was considered to be in the

possession of its consignee, when considered in the perspective of law applicable

to carriage of goods by sea, which has no direct relevance in imputing criminal

liability when a consignee is involved with an illegal importation.

Returning to the definition of importation, it had already been noted that

although the Legislature in its wisdom thought it fit to provide a definition to the

words "manufacture" and "trafficking" in Section 54A of Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, however, desisted itself from providing a

definition to the word" import". There would have been a very valid reason for

this deliberate omission by the legislative body. In the absence of a statutory

10

definition to the term "import" in the said Ordinance, it is to be taken as to its

ordinary dictionary meaning, without this Court attempting to Legislate by

providing one through judicial interpretation. It has already been noted that the

word "import" means to "bring from abroad", as per Attorney General v

Kumarasinghe (supra).

There is at least one reported authority which had dealt with the term

"importation" as found in the Opium Ordinance No.5 of 1910. A similar view, as

the one adopted in Attorney General v Kumarasinghe (supra), was expressed in

relation to Section 4(1)(a) of Opium Ordinance No. 5 of 1910, by Dalton J in the

judgment of Ashton v Craos 30 NLR 369 where it was held;

" ... The definition of time of an importation as set out in section 14

of the Customs Ordinance, 1869, is only for the purpose of

determining in the instances set out the precise time at which an

importation shall be deemed to have had effect. In Whitfield v.

Martin Singho [1 9 C. L. R. 1031 however it was common ground

between the parties that "importation " in both the Excise and

Opium Ordinances meant the actual landing of the article and that

was accepted as correct by Lyall Grant J. in upholding a conviction

on a charge of attempting to import. A person may do something in

respect of the importation of an article,. in other words begin to

import an article, before it is actually landed, but the act of

importation is in the ordinary course completed, in the absence of

any law or regulation governing special cases, when the article

comes over sea, as here, by the landing of the article in Ceylon."

11

On one hand, the judgments of De Silva and Others v L.B. Finance Ltd.,

(1993) 1 371, Toussaint v Cecilia 37 NLR 308, Appuhamy v Mahil 50 NLR 263

indicate that the superior Courts in the absence of any statutory definition have

opted to adopt the dictionary meaning of the undefined word as found in a

particular Section of a statute.

On the other hand, there also had been instances where the Courts have

consciously avoided adopting the general dictionary meaning as to its

interpretation of a particular word found in the statute, owing to its plurality in

meaning and the ensuing complexities if such an adoption by a Court would

necessarily entail. In Attorney General v Rodriguesz 19 NLR 65 it was observed

by the Court, in relation to the task before it in finding an appropriate meaning

to the word "concerned", that a " ... very little assistance can be obtained from the

dictionary meaning, or the derivation of the word "concerned"." There are also

instances where the Courts have deliberately refrained itself from providing a

definition to a particular word found in the statute, to which the parties

attempted to attribute a meaning more favourable to each of them.

The case of Fernando v Nesadurai 49 NLR 263 is one such example.

Basnayake J (as he was then) did not venture to provide a definition when there

was no statutory definition provided to the word "building" as "... it will be

unsafe to make this case the occasion for attempting to define on an expression which

even the legislature has left alone ... ".

The word "import" under different statutes has received attention of

Courts. An opportunity arose before the Supreme Court to determine "the

precise time at which an importation" of a ship was made and completed under

Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance. In delivering its judgment of Vallibel

12

Lanka(Pvt) Ltd., v Director General of Customs and three Others (2008) 1 Sri

L.R. 219 on this point, the apex Court stated thus;

"The court therefore has to examine section 16 of the Customs

Ordinance in order to ascertain the time and mode of importation of

the said vessel into the limits of the port. In terms of the said section

the precise time at which importation of any goods shall be deemed

to be the time at which the ship importing such goods had actually

come within the limits of the port." (emphasis original)

The word importation to which the Oxford dictionary attributes the

meaning "bring (goods or services) into a country from abroad" sounds a very

simple process of moving goods across borders of two or more countries. There

is no indication in the dictionary meaning that the word "import" in that context

also includes the point of time when an act of importation is completed. Needless

to say that the simple physical act of "importation" had assumed much greater

complexity in the present day globalised trading practices and thereby inviting

application of legal considerations in both domestic and international spheres.

Thus, the act of importation had transformed itself into a complicated and

drawn out process rather than a mere physical movement of goods across the

frontiers of two or more States.

The various steps that are involved with importation of goods via sea

freight was discussed by the Supreme Court in Sri Lanka Ports Authority v

Peiris (1981) 1 Sri L.R. 101, when it looked into the legality of the imposition of

certain charges by the appellant Authority on the Respondent, a consignee who

had imported some goods by sea freight.

13

Their Lordships observed that;

"... the 'port services' that are obligatory on the Corporation to

provide. These include stevedoring and landing. "Stevedoring"

means "loading or unloading of the of the cargo of a ship", and

"stevedoring" is defined in section 80 of the Act to mean "the

operations connected with the loading, discharging, shipping,

trans-shipping and storing of cargo in the holds of, or on board,

any vessel". These services involve, inter alia, the provision of cargo

barges or lighters by the Corporation for the landing and

discharging of cargo. The Corporation has to bring the cargo in the

lighter to the delivery point and thereafter the consignee has to clear

the cargo and release the lighter without undue delay. The service of

stevedoring and landing is not completed until the lighter

containing the cargo is cleared by the consignee. Default on the part

of the consignee in expeditiously clearing the cargo will result in the

detention of the plaintiff s lighter. Then the consignee will become

liable for damages for such detention. 'Demurrage' generally

signifies the agreed amount to be paid as. compensation for undue

detention beyond the stipulated time.

It is also legally presumed that the ownership or possession of any goods

in transit referred to a bill of lading always lies with the consignee even though

the entities such as shipping agents, crew of the vessel and agencies connected to

cargo storage which may have the temporary possession of that consignment

only in the capacity of agents of the consignee. However, that position is not

applicable to the instant appeal.

14

The complexity of the process of "importation" in the context of Customs

is indicative from the long description of it in providing a Legislative definition

of time of an importation as contained in Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance.

Section 16 is a deeming provision where its provisions could be applied when "it

shall become necessary to determine the precise time at which ab importation or

exportation of any goods made completed ... " and in Vallibel Lanka(Pvt.) Ltd., v

Director General of Customs and three Others (ibid) this aspect was considered

when the superior Court sought to decide the question of fact whether a

particular ship was imported on a particular day or not.

Thus, it is clear that the Legislature thought it fit to leave the word

"import", in relation to Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance, without a statutory definition although it did provide one, in relation

to Section 16 of the Customs Ordinance, which applies to importations that are

subject to its provisions and where applicable to Import (Control) Act. The

offences that are defined in Section 54A of the said Ordinance were brought in by

the amendment Act No. 13 of 1984, which had been introduced primarily to put

in place an effective legal regime to combat the ever growing menace of illegal

supply of dangerous drugs for local consumption. The intention of the

Legislature could be easily inferred with its decision to insert a totally new

Section to the Ordinance and thereby criminalising the acts of manufacture,

import and export, trafficking in and possession of dangerous drugs and

statutorily prescribing harsh penalties, which had left the Courts with limited

discretion in determining an appropriate sentence for the offenders of these

offences, as decided by the Supreme Court in Thiruchelvam v Attorney General

(1995) 2 Sri L.R. 135.

15

The dictionary meaning of the word import therefore merely provides a

very general reference as it simply means the movement of goods across

international borders. This general meaning of the word import is clearly

inadequate to determine the issue, as necessitated by the submissions of the

learned President's Counsel, raised in the instant appeal, as to the exact point of

time at which an act of importation is made complete. In these circumstances,

even if the Courts preferred to accept the general meaning of the word "Import"

as a starting point, it must retain its discretion to decide this vital issue whether

there is importation in any given set of circumstances as revealed in the evidence

presented before it. In doing so, the Courts will be mindful of some applicable

considerations in relation to interpretation of statutes.

In Dorothy Silva v Inspector of Police, City Vice Squad, Pettah 78 NLR

553, the then Supreme Court stated:-

"Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Edition, page 40

quotes the following passage from Heydon's case in regard to

legislation which seeks to suppress the mischief and advance the

remedy.

" The true reason of the remedy; and then the office of all the

Judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress

the mischief and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle

inventions and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and

pro private commodo, and to add force and life to the cure

and remedy, according to the true intent of the maker of the

Act, pro bono publico. "

16

The Supreme Court, in De Zoysa v Fernando (2005) 1 Sri L.R. 10,

emphasised this rule of interpretation as Weerasuriya J stated "The provisions of a

statute must be construed with reference to their context and with due regard to the

object to be achieved and the mischief to be prevented. Where two views are possible an

interpretation which would advance the remedy and suppress the mischief it

con templates is to be preferred. "

If, the Courts were to provide a definition to the word "import" in Section

54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, as expected in the

present instance, in the absence of a statutory interpretation, there could arise

situations where some future event may prove its inadequacy in the suppression

of the mischief the Legislature had sought with the relevant pieces of legislature.

In the circumstances, its apt to repeat here Basnayake J's statement" ... it will be

unsafe to make this case the occasion for attempting to define on an expression which

even the legislature has left alone ... n.

When the Legislature brought the amendment to Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance by way of Act No. 13 of 1984, it is presumed that it

was aware of the general interpretation given by the Courts to the word

"import" in Section 4(1)(a) of the Opium Ordinance in Ashton v Croos (supra)

and therefore would have decided against in providing one, leaving the Courts

to decide that question of fact which might have a legal aspect intertwined to it

as well, upon the evidence presented. In fact, that was the approach adopted by

the superior Court in Ashton v Croos (supra);

"On the facts it seems to me clear that both the accused were

concerned in importing the opium set out in the first count, and

were also concerned in transporting the ganja set out in the second

17

count in contravention of the provlszons of the respective

Ordinances men tioned. "

In these circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that due to the sheer

complexity of the processes, both legal and physical, that are involved with of

importation, the Legislature, being mindful and alive to those practical realities

and limitations, had desisted itself from providing a statutory definition to the

word "import" in Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance, and found a pragmatic solution by leaving a discretion and thereby

allowing the Courts to determine; whether, in a given set of circumstances, there

is an act of importation or not and if there is importation, when, that particular

importation was made.

When the submission of the learned President's Counsel is considered, it

appears that he challenges the conviction, in respect of the count of importation,

on two grounds. Firstly, he highlights the discrepancy in relation to the date of

importation as specified in the indictment and the date of importation as

revealed upon evidence presented by the witnesses for the prosecution.

Secondly, he contends that if the pounding machine was already imported as it

had arrived in Sri Lanka on 17th and landed on 18thApril 2004 , then the

Appellant could not have re-imported it once again between 28th and 30th April

2004 as alleged by the indictment. Learned President's Counsel contended that

the act of importation was already completed when the machine landed in Sri

Lanka on 18th April 2004.

A Similar argument, as the one presented in the instant appeal, was

presented by the appellant in Ashton v Croos (supra). The evidence that were

18

available before Courts in the said appeal is as follows. The two appellants

Anthony Croos and Mallis Appu were jointly charged with importation of four

pounds of Opium in H.M. Customs launch "Wasp" on 7th September 1928. The

said quantity of Opium was brought in to the launch from the ship "55 Bamora",

which had dropped anchor apparently a few days prior to the detection. The

quantity of Opium was detected in the early hours of the date specified in the

charge, near the bridge over the Lake Canal.

On behalf of the two appellants, it was submitted that " .. . the ganja and

opium had been imported so soon as the ship " Bamora " reached territorial waters or

came to rest in the harbour, and if that was so, the landing of it from ship to shore by the

launch was not" importation".

Dalton J, having noted that" ... in Whitefield v Martin Singho (19 CL.R.

103), however, it was common ground that between the parties that "importation" in

both the Excise and Opium Ordinances meant the actual landing of the article and that

was accepted by Lyall Grant J in upholding a charge of attempting to import,"

thereafter proceeded to hold that" ... on the facts it seems to me clear that both the

accused were concerned in importing the opium" and dismissed their appeal.

It appears from the above, the Court had accepted that there was

importation of Opium on the basis that the quantity of opium had actually

landed when it was found ashore in the possession of the appellants, although

the ship, in which the Opium was brought on board, had already dropped

anchor in the Port of Colombo, prior to its subsequent detection on land. This

clearly indicated that the Courts have consciously steered away from the

adaptation of a rigid definition of "import" as given in Customs Ordinance, and

in determining the issue whether there was an act of importation which had been

19

statutorily criminalised, opted to retain its discretion to determine the said issue,

upon the evidence presented before them.

After a lengthy discussion and determination of as to the law which is

applicable in determining the issue whether there was importation as alleged or

not, it is appropriate at this juncture to turn the attention of Court, to consider the

evidence presented before the trial Court by the prosecution in relation to the

said allegation of importation.

Deputy Director of Customs Lesly Gamini, who was in charge of the

Preventive Unit of Sri Lanka Customs, received information from one of his

private informants that prohibited drugs are being brought into Sri Lanka,

concealed in a pounding machine imported by Aloy Expo Pvt Ltd of 98C,

Avariwatte Road, Wattala. Said pounding machine arrived at Colombo Port in

container TXEU 4749362 on board the vessel Orient Success on 17.04.2004. This

information was duly entered in form DOPL 187 and Assistant Superintendents

of Customs Udaya Gamini and Senanayake were entrusted with the responsibility

of investigating into the veracity of said information on 21.04.2004. They have

therefore opened up a file in relation to this investigation under reference

POM/610/2004. When they enquired as to the location of the suspected

pounding machine, it was learnt that the machine had already been unloaded

and removed to "B/Q" warehouse, which belonged to Sri Lanka Ports Authority.

The Customs Officers have then issued a letter preventing the clearance of the

said machine to the keeper of the said warehouse. They did not receive any co-

operation by the officers of SLP A to locate and identify the suspected pounder

machine, but with the assistance of the store keeper, the officers have finally

located it. The machine was mounted on a wooden palette and had a label

affixed to it indicating that it had arrived through the vessel "Lanka Mahapola".

20

The machine was then taken charge by the Customs with the entry "seized by

Customs" and removed the same to "Japan" Warehouse on 27.04.2004, which

was operated under the control of the preventive unit of Sri Lanka Customs.

Since the Customs could not proceed with an inquiry without the

consignee claiming ownership to the machine, the officers had to wait until the

Appellant Ottalie Velaydhan Sunil Lal and 2nd accused Geetani Dhammika

Dharmaratn presented themselves before the Customs with the relevant

documentation in relation to the importation of the said pounding machine.

The Certificate of Origin ("P3") pertaining to the shipment of the said

pounding machine indicated it was to be shipped on board Merchant Vessel

Orient Success from the port of Cochin in India. It also indicates that the

consignee is named as "Aloy Expo (Pvt) Ltd., of98C, Averiwatta Road, Wattala". The

Bill of Lading dated 15.04.2004 ("P5") too is in the name of the said consignee

and it bears confirmation that the consignment was "Shipped On Board" on

15.04.2004. By an email ("PT), the Indian Shipping agency had amended the

name of the consignee to Geetani Dhammika Dharmaratna of 55/7, St Anthony's

Mawatha, Colombo 3, the 2nd accused. The Cargo Arrival Notice ("P6"), Invoice

("P9"), Delivery Order ("P8"), Value Declaration to Sri Lanka Customs ("P11"),

were all in the name of the 2nd accused as the consignee of the pounding

machine.

On 28.04.2004, the Appellant and the 2nd accused have presented

themselves to the Customs claiming their ownership to the pounding machine.

They tendered documentation in support of their claim in importation of the

pounding machine, which included of a faxed copy of the catalogue of the

pounding machine, a draft Bill of Lading with its two originals, Cargo Arrival

21

Notice, original of the Certificate of Country of Origin. However, the Appellant

and 2nd accused had no relevant documentation concerning payment of the

Customs Duty and importation taxes with them and were advised to obtain

services of a Wharf Clerk to complete the process of clearing, which they did on

the following day.

Witness Gamini (PWI) had thereafter released the documents back to the

Appellant, who then returned to him with the Customs Assessment Notice,

Delivery Copy of the Customs, Invoice, Delivery Order, Draft Bill of Lading,

Certificate of Country of Origin and the faxed copy of the catalogue. The witness,

having satisfied that the Appellant had already paid the required Customs Duty,

proceeded along with him and the 2nd accused to the Japan Warehouse, where

the Appellant identified the pounding machine PI as the one he imported from

India.

The witness also had noted that the signature that appeared in the Invoice

P9, appears to be of the Partner of Nass Associates, the exporter from India,

bears a remarkable resemblance to the signature of the Appellant, that appeared

in his initial statement to Customs on 28.04.2004. This observation by the witness

assumes greater relevance as to the role played by the Appellant in the

importation of the machine, when the Court considers this item of evidence in

the light of the witness Kumara Aloysius who gave evidence on behalf of the

Company Aloy Exports (Pvt.) Ltd, the initial consignee of the pounding machine.

Witness Jude Kumara Aloysius states that he had setup the Company Aloy

Exports (pvt.) Ltd and his Company is involved only with exporting of

vegetables and not with any imports. He knew the Appellant due to prior

acquaintance. The Appellant had some discussion with him concerning

22

importation of a machine. The witness declined to proceed with the said

proposal and the Appellant departed only with the witness's business card. At a

later point of time, a wharf clerk and the Customs have contacted him over an

instance of importation of a pounding machine, to which he totally denied of any

involvement or knowledge. He also states that he never opened any Letter of

Credit for importation of such a machine nor had any documentation relating to

this particular import in his possession. This evidence was not challenged by the

Appellant as he did not cross examine the witness Aloysius.

The missing parts of the sequence of events as to how the shipping

documents, initially made in the name of the said Company, and the

circumstances under which an amendment to the consignee's name is disclosed

by witness Bandula Withanage, a former wharf clerk. According to this witness,

the Appellant approached him in April 2004 and wanted the witness to clear a

pounding machine that he is about to import through a Company located in

Wattala. By then the witness's license to act as a clearing agent had lapsed.

However, when the witness had called to the "importer" of the machine, whose

contact number was provided by the Appellant, he was told that the "importer"

had nothing to do with this particular importation. The witness then conveyed

this information to the Appellant, who, upon hearing the refusal of the Company

to get involved with the clearing of the pounding machine, had directed the

witness to amend the name of the consignee by supplying a name of a woman

with an address in Kollupitiya. The required fee for the change of name was paid

by the Appellant himself.

In her evidence, the 2nd accused said that she knew the Appellant from her

childhood and had attended his wedding in Kerala, India. In April 2004, the

Appellant had called her from India and requested her help in clearing a 23

pounding machine he had shipped. The Appellant told her that the Company

which imported the machine had changed its mind and the machine might be

useful in her cake business. It was her understanding that the imported machine

is of a size of a kitchen blender which could be kept on a table and even if the

machine did not meet her expectations, then it could be sold to a third party. The

Appellant mentioned that the machine would cost her about 300 USD and she

could pay in instalments. When she saw the machine on the 30th April at the

Customs, she realised that the imported machine is an industrial grade one and

not suited for home use.

In concluding that the Appellant is guilty of the importation of the

specified quantity of Heroin, the trial Court had considered the evidence

presented before it by prosecution as well as the evidence of the Appellant and

the 2nd accused along with their witnesses. The evidence of the 2nd accused was

accepted as credible by the trial Court and acted upon it since she was acquitted

from the two counts upon which the prosecution had founded its accusation

against her. There is no challenge to that determination.

In addition to above, the trial Court had correctly decided to act upon the

admissions made by the Appellant during his cross examination by the

prosecution. The Appellant had admitted the following in cross examination;

a. he had overseen the packaging of the machine prior to its shipping by

its exporter in India,

b. that it was he who had imported the pounding machine,

c. he had prepared the documents in the name of the 2nd accused to clear

the machine, when the Company refused to get involved,

d. he had planned the importation, and

24

e. he had identified the machine as the one he had ordered from the

Indian exporter.

As it was highlighted the pounding machine was brought into Sri Lanka

on 17.04.2004 and remained unclaimed in the warehouse, awaiting the arrival of

the Appellant and the 2nd accused on 28.04.2004, along with the relevant

shipping documents with a view of completing the clearing procedure and

securing its release. The specified quantity of Heroin was concealed in the said

machine. Obviously the concealed quantity of Heroin was not declared to

Customs and had not been brought into Sri Lanka upon any valid legal

authorisation. Therefore, when the importation of the machine reached its final

stage of the process of importation, so did the quantity of Heroin concealed in it.

The fact that Heroin was found in the machine is a fact which had been admitted

during the trial by the parties under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

The word "import" is a "verb", which in turn also described as "action".

This presupposes that there should be an act and a doer of this act. Therefore, in

relation to the act of importation, an item or a consignment of goods must not

only be brought from abroad but must have its nexus to the doer, the importer.

The offence of importation could not therefore be committed by merely

bringing goods across frontiers of a country without the intervention of an

importer who initiates and complies the process of importation. This type of

situation can only happen when such things are merely found ashore in a

particular country after having drifted into its territorial waters from that of

another country, probably after shipwreck or being thrown aboard from a vessel

due to some reason. In these situations, the mere landing of an item is not

25

importation because that has happened without a conscious act of an individual.

Another situation would be a particular item may have been found being

abandoned in the transit lounge of an airport, where no individual claiming he

had imported that item, although it may have had its origins in a foreign country

and found in Sri Lanka. This type of situation itself would not satisfy the offence

of importation, unless someone decides to move it beyond the transit area and

completes the process.

In this particular instance, therefore, the point at which the importation

process had reached its culmination is when the Appellant and 2nd accused have

claimed ownership to the pounding machine and completed the clearing

procedure after making the relevant payment of the Government Taxes on the

machine. That enabled them to have total control of the imported article with its

contents. Then only the Appellant will have complete access to the Heroin

concealed within the machine. If the Appellant and the 2nd accused did not

present themselves for clearing of the machine, the Machine would have

remained in the custody of the Customs, subjected to the statutory provisions

contained in Section 83 of the Customs Ordinance. If that was the situation, the

machine may have landed in Sri Lanka, but the act of importation remains

incomplete for there cannot be a situation where some item merely happens to be

in Sri Lanka after being ferried across borders without someone consciously

initiating and completing the process of importation.

It is noted above that the Appellant and the 2nd accused, being the actual

importer and the "consignee" of the pounding machine respectively, have, by

presenting themselves and clearing the imported pounding machine containing

Heroin, completed the process of importation and thereby marked its terminal

point. Therefore, the mere fact of landing the machine in Sri Lanka containing 26

Heroin, without its formal clearing by the importer would not therefore complete

the process of importation as envisaged in Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. The terminal point of the process of

importation reached only on the 28th April 2004 when the Appellant and 2nd

accused, having identified the item, paid applicable Customs duties and cleared

the imported article. This day is well within the specified time period as per the

indictment upon which the Appellant was tried. If not for the prior information

received by Customs the pounding machine would have been released to the

Appellant and 2nd accused.

In order to prove the offence of importation of a dangerous drug, not only

the prosecution must prove the physical act of bringing it across the borders of

Sri Lanka by an importer, but also that the importer has had the requisite mental

element in the act of importation.

It is evident, even upon a cursory glance of the wording in Section 54A or

54B of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act

No. 13 of 1984, that there is no mention of the word "knowingly" in the

importation, possession, trafficking in of any prohibited substance. This

conspicuous absence of any reference to a mental element in respect of the

commission of the offences that are set out in the said Sections, had given rise to

an impression that there was no burden on the prosecution to prove a mental

element.

Legality of this particular view was examined by this Court in Van der

Hults v Attorney General (1989) 1 Sri L.R. 204, when the appellant contended

that" ... the learned trial judge had misdirected himself in law when he held that there

was no burden on the prosecution to prove that the appellant had the knowledge that he

27

..

was carrying a prohibited drug, and that therefore his conviction was invalid." This was

an instance where the appellant before their Lordships was accused of illegal

possession of and exporting a prohibited drug and thereby committed offences

described in Sections 54A and 54B of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984, which made those acts punishable

offences.

In delivering its judgment of Van der Hults v Attorney General (ibid), a

divisional bench of this Court stated;

"We are of the view that mens rea is an essential ingredient of the

offences with which the appellant was charged. The ordinance

nowhere rules out the necessity, recognized in the general law, that

the prosecution must prove this element beyond reasonable doubt."

Adoption of this VIew is a reflection of continuation of a consistent

approach of the appellate Courts.

After undertaking an exhaustive consideration and analysis of the

applicable judicial precedents, Ennis J, in delivering the judgment of Attorney

General v Rodriguesz 19 NLR 65, quoted the judgment of Sherras v De Rutzen

(1895) 1 QB 918, where Wright J stated thus:-

"There is a presumption that mens rea, an evil intention or a

knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act, is an essential ingredient

in every offence; but that presumption is liable to be displaced either

by the words of the statute creating the offence, or by the subject-

matter with which it deals, and both must be considered."

28

In Ashton v Craos 30 NLR 369, Dalton J applied the requirement of

requisite knowledge on the part of the appellants as his Lordship concluded" ...

that both accused were fully aware that Martin was conveying ganja and opium ashore

and were both playing a willing and active part in its conveyance."

A divisional bench of the then Supreme Court, in its judgement of Perera v

Munaweera 56 NLR 433 had stated that "The correctness of the principle referred to

at p. 43-that the absence of the word" knowingly" shifts the burden of proof-has been

doubted by Devlin J. in Taylor's Central Garages (Exeter) v. Roper [5 (1951) 2 T. L.

R. 284]". This has been the consistent approach adopted by the English Courts as

well. Archbold (2015) states (at p.1967) in reference to the word "knowingly" that

"... where this word is included in the definition of an offence it makes it plain that the

doctrine of mens rea applies to that offence. However, its absence is no indication that the

doctrine does not apply" as per the judgment of the House of Lords by Lord Reid in

Sweet v Parsley [1970] A.c. 132.

In Shanmugaraja v Republic of Sri Lanka (1990) 2 Sri L.R. 57, the appellant

was accused of illegal importation and possession of a dangerous drug and

following the pronouncement of Van der Hults v Attorney General (ibid), it was

recognised that in the instances where it is alleged that the offence of illegal

importation of a dangerous drug is committed, the prosecution must also prove

the mental element being existences of requisite knowledge of the accused.

The then Supreme Court had the occasion to consider the question as to

who should prove "importation" during proceedings before the District Court

for seizure of prohibited goods, in Attorney General v Lebbe Thamby 61 NLR

254. In this instance, Basnayake q has held;

29

"The Customs Ordinance is a penal enactment which imposes

severe penalties on those who violate its provisions. The Crown

must therefore establish any breach of those provisions beyond

reasonable doubt as in a criminal prosecution. The onus of proving

that the gold bars were imported being on the Crown it should have

established that fact beyond reasonable doubt. It has failed to do so.

The onus proving lawful importation does not therefore lie on the

respondents. "

It is trite law that in a criminal prosecution, the burden of proving its

allegation lies squarely on the prosecution and both the actus reus and mens rea

of the alleged offence must be proved beyond reasonable doubt, except for very

limited instances where the Legislature thought it fit to depart from this

fundamental principle.

Thus, in view of the above precedents, it is settled law that in the offences

that are described in Section 54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended consists of both physical and mental elements.

In these offences, the mental element consists of the accused's knowledge

of the criminalised act, he is accused of and engaged in. The nature of the

requisite knowledge of the offences of illegal trafficking in and possession of a

dangerous drug and the attendant circumstances a Court would take into

consideration in determining its presence had received attention in

Sumanawathie Perera v Attorney General (1998) 2 Sri L.R. 20, in the light of the

reasoning of an English judgment of Warner v. Metropolitan Police

30

Commissioner (1968) 52 Criminal Appeal Report 373, where Lord Wilberforce

stated as follows:-

"The question, to which an answer is required, and in the end a

jury must answer it, is whether in the circumstances the accused

should be held to have possession of the substance, rather than mere

control. Tn order to decide between these two, the jury should, in my

opinion, be invited to consider all the circumstances - to use again

the words of Pollock & Wright, Possession in the Common Law, p.

119 - the 'modes or events' by which the custody commences and

the legal incident in which it is held. By these I mean, relating them

to typical situations, that they must consider the manner and

circumstances in which the substance, or something which contains

it, had been received, what knowledge or means of knowledge or

guilty knowledge as to the presence of the substance, or as to the

nature of what has been received, the accused had at the time of

receipt or thereafter up to the moment when he is found with it; his

legal relation to the substance or package (including his right of

access to it). On such matters as these (not exhaustively stated)

they must make the decision whether, in addition to physical

control, he has, or ought to have imputed to him the intention to

possess, or knowledge that he does possess, what is in fact a

prohibited substance. If he has this intention or knowledge, it is not

additionally necessary that he should know the nature of the

substances"

31

In R v Hussain [1969]2 QB 567 Lord Widgery stated what the accused must

know is;

" ... the evasIOn of a prohibition against importation and he

knowingly takes part in that operation, ... even if he does not know

precisely what kind of goods are being imported. It is, of course,

essential that he should know that the goods which are being

imported are goods subject to a prohibition. It is essential he should

know that the operation with which he is concerning himself is an

operation designed to evade that prohibition and evade it

fraudulently" .

In relatively a recent judgment of Regina v Forbes [2001] UKHL 40, it is

stated that the correctness of decision in R. v Hussain (ibid) by Lord Widgery LJ

was accepted in R v Hennessey (1978) 68 Cr App R 419,R v Taaffe [1984] AC 539,

547and in R v Shivpuri [1987] AC 1.

The judgment of R v Hennessey (ibid) is where Lawton LJ added:

"It matters not for the purpose of conviction what the goods were as

long as he knew that he was bringing into the United Kingdom

goods which he should not have been bringing in."

The English Courts have also considered instances where the knowledge

could be imputed constructively. In such instances, Lord Bridge in Westminster

City Council v Croyalgrange Ltd, 83 Cr. App. Rep 155, stated U it is always

open to the tribunal of fact ... to base a finding of knowledge on evidence that the

32

defendant had deliberately shut his eyes to the obvious or refrained inquiry because he

suspected the truth but did not wish to have his suspicions confirmed."

This clearly indicates the nature of the mental element that is necessary to

to prove the commission of the offence of importation of a dangerous drug. The

requisite mental element is the knowledge entertained by the accused that he is

possessing and or importing some substance subject to a prohibition to possess

and as well as to import.

In the instant appeal, what the prosecution was required to establish in

relation to its allegation of importation of a prohibited drug was that the

Appellant had imported the Heroin and in doing so he also had the requisite

knowledge of the prohibited substance and of its importation.

The evidence presented by the prosecution clearly establish that the

appellant had taken an active role to import the said machine into Sri Lanka from

India. The admission marked by the prosecution and the Appellant at the very

outset of the trial under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.

15 of 1979, indicated the fact Heroin was detected in the said pounding machine

is admitted without any formal proof of that fact being proved through

witnesses. There was no dispute by the Appellant either to the fact that the pure

quantity of Heroin that was detected concealed in the said pounding machine is

2257.4 grams.

Thus, the trial Court only had to consider, whether it is satisfied from the

evidence presented by the prosecution to the required degree of proof; firstly,

whether it was the Appellant who imported the prohibited substance concealed

in a pounding machine (the physical element of the offence of importation) and

secondly, whether the Appellant, when he imported the said pounding machine,

33

has had the requisite knowledge of the prohibited substance concealed therein

(the mental element).

Learned Senior State Counsel, during his submissions, had highlighted the

Appellant's conduct during the Customs inquiry particularly at the time of

detection of Heroin, concealed in one of the stainless steel pipes.

After the identification of the imported pounder, by the Appellant and the

2nd accused witnesses Gamini and Senanayake have inspected it in order to verify

the information they received regarding importation of illicit drugs concealed

within. They suspected the only place there could be a concealment of drugs

would be the stainless steel pipes that are attached to the machine. According to

Gamini, these steel pipes were heavily coated with grease, an unusual precaution,

in view of the fact that they were made of stainless steel. One of the pipes were

removed from the machine, and the party consisting of the Appellant, the 2nd

accused and the witnesses, had thereafter proceeded along to a nearby lathe shop

where the stainless steel pipe was drilled into and thereupon the discovery was

made by the prosecution witnesses of the concealed Heroin contained within it.

With this discovery of Heroin, the Appellant, having claimed it is Heroin, had

thereafter made a generous offer of a cash reward, if the witnesses are prepared

to discontinue with their investigation. The witnesses also claim that the

Appellant had thereafter revealed an easy method to release the concealed

Heroin from the three remaining stainless steel pipes. It was later revealed that

each of these pipes could be separated into two parts by applying the method

described by the Appellant and thereby making a total of eight segments of

stainless steel pipe.

34

The detection of Heroin was duly reported to their seruor officer, the

Director of Customs, and the witnesses have weighed the detected Heroin which

was in eight packets separately in the presence of the Appellant and the 2nd

accused. The Police Narcotics Bureau was thereafter informed of the detection

and the productions were sealed in the presence of lP Welagedara, later who

arrived to take over the productions and the suspects from the Customs. These

productions were handed over to the PNB on 01.05.2004 at 6.30 p.m.

The analysis conducted by the Government Analyst Department revealed

that the eight parcels contained 4958.6 grams of brown powder and it contained

2257.4 grams of pure Heroin. Traces of Heroin was also identified in the eight

metal pipes sent for analysis.

This evidence indicates the existence of the both physical and mental

elements of the offence of importation of a prohibited dangerous drug. During

cross examination of these witnesses, the Appellant suggested to them that the

witnesses have failed to mention the conduct attributed to him this factor in their

statements and have come out with it only during trial. At that point of time,

learned State Counsel had pointed out to trial Court that the witness had in fact

mentioned that fact in his statement.

The Appellant during his examination in chief itself claimed that he paid

Rs. 5000.00 to Customs officers when Heroin was detected but thereafter denied

having made any cash offer without explaining as to why he parted with that

money. He denied the pointed suggestion on this aspect during cross

examination. He also denied that he never admitted Heroin but signed his

statement under compulsion. Only during his cross examination by the 2nd

accused, did the Appellant said if he knew the machine contained Heroin, he

35

would not have got involved in the clearing. However, he did not deny that he

had disclosed the officers of an easy method in taking out the concealed Heroin

inside the remaining steel pipes. The conduct attributed to the Appellant by the

prosecution remained unchallenged.

In Gunapala v Attorney General ( which states 2007) 1 Sri L.R. 273, when

the appellant had raised the issue of whether the non-production of murder

weapon during trial adversely affects the validity of the conviction, this Court, in

addition to considering several Indian authorities where similar sentiment was

expressed, placed reliance upon the following statement of HNG Fernando J (as

he was then) in the judgment of Edrick de Silva v Chandradasa de Silva 70 NLR

169, in arriving at the conclusion when an appellant had failed to challenge a

particular factual position that had been presented by the prosecution before the

trial Court, in appeal he cannot successfully challenge that fact;

" ... Where there is ample opportunity to contradict the evidence of

a witness but is not impugned or assailed in cross-examination that

is a special fact and feature in the case. It is a matter falling within

the definition of the Word "prove" in section 3 of the Evidence

Ordinance, and as trial Judge or Court must necessarily take that

factinto consideration in adjudicating the issue before It ... ",

This Court, in the unreported judgment of Phillipu Mandige Nalaka

Krishantha Kumara Thisera v Attorney-General-CA 87/2005 -CAM

17.5.2007had held that;

" ... whenever evidence given by a witness on a material point is

not challenged in cross examination, it has to be concluded that

36

such evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent

subject of course to the qualification that the witness is a reliable

witness.".

This reasoning was adopted and followed by this Court in Karunaratne V

Attorney General (2007) 1 Sri L.R. 255 as well as in Subasinghe v Attorney

General (2007) 1 Sri L.R. 224.

Thus, it is clear from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses and that of

the 2nd accused, that, it was the Appellant who actually imported the machine by

making the purchase, overseeing its shipping, preparing the necessary

documentation, using his friend's Company name as the consignee, amending

the papers to insert the 2nd accused name by luring her with the prospect of

improving her cake business with the machine, when he realised the Company

would not get involved in clearing, then getting her to clear it once it had arrived

in Sri Lanka using her as a proxy, supports a strong inference against him, that

he did know what was inside the machine when it was imported and had taken

precautions not to leave any incriminating evidence against him in its

importation.

When the role played by the Appellant in the process of importation is

considered in the light of these particular items of evidence, his ground of appeal

which was founded on the fact that the inconsistencies that exists in the evidence

as to his alleged conduct at the point on which Heroin was detected, whether he

made a confession, or did a demonstration to the benefit of the Customs officers

making those items of evidence unreliable, could not succeed. Witness Gamini

had in fact mentioned those items of evidence in his statement and therefore is

37

quite insufficient to raise any reliability issue in these circumstances. In

considering the fact that of Udaya Gamini gave evidence in a Court of law for the

first time in this particular instance is a factor that had to be considered by the

trial Court in assessing his credibility, in addition to his approach to the

detection. The subsequent conduct of the Appellant since the detection, though

relevant in criminal proceedings, may not have received the attention it should

have, by the two Customs officers who are primarily trained to detect Customs

violations.

There was credible evidence before the trial Court that the machine was in

fact shipped from India and was brought to Sri Lanka aboard a ship. There was

also evidence that it had been brought ashore and kept in a warehouse. Thus, the

machine had in fact been "brought from abroad". This satisfies the general meaning

of "import". But the offence of "import" of a dangerous drug envisages an

additional factor to complete the process of importation which occurred on 28th

April 2004. That was the day in which the Appellant and 2nd accused have

cleared the item from Customs. Therefore, the allegation of importation of

Heroin as specified in the indictment has been proved by the prosecution to the

required degree of proof.

Thus, in view of the above considerations, this Court is of the considered

view that the trial Court had correctly concluded that the offence of importation

of the specified quantity of Heroin during the time period specified in the

indictment has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, this Court

holds the view that the ground of appeal raised on this point is not entitled to

succeed.

38

Remaining grounds of appeal that had been raised by the Appellant had

one common underlying element. All of these grounds are based on the

proposition that the prosecution had failed to prove the identity of the item

imported into Sri Lanka. The concerns expressed by the learned President's

Counsel on the inconsistency as to the number of days the officers have

attempted to trace the pounding machine among the other consignments

received by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the inconsistency as to the exact date

on which the Appellant had presented himself at the Customs, the inconsistency

in the description of the machine as spoken to by the prosecution witnesses and

also as to the vessel in which it had arrived, whether it was mounted on a palette

or in a crate and the inconsistency as to the reference number of investigations

have this common denominator and had a bearing on the issue of the

identification of the imported item.

It was stressed at the hearing of the instant appeal that the shipping

documents clearly indicate the machine that had been shipped from India was

contained in a crate but when the Customs Officers have located the pounding

machine, it was mounted on a palate and not in a crate. It also had a label affixed

to it that it had arrived in Sri Lanka aboard the ship Sri Lanka Mahapola but the

shipping documents indicate that it had arrived aboard vessel Orient Success.

Learned President's Counsel also highlighted the inconsistencies that exist in

relation to the number of days the officers have taken to identify the machine,

the wrong dates and reference numbers in internal communications of the

Customs.

In stressing the stance of denial of the Appellant, learned President's

Counsel submitted that the prosecution witnesses were suggested that a wrong

39

machine was identified by the Customs and the Appellant was therefore

consistent in his position of denial.

The prosecution witness Gamini said that unless and until someone claims

ownership of the imported rice pounder, they could not proceed with inquiry in

relation to the importation of narcotics, by examining the machine upon

dismantling it. Witness Priyantha Senanayake (PW2) also had testified as to the

importance of such identification of a cargo item by its consignee. According to

him, if there is no identification by the consignee, then a different procedure

applies and the identification of the item had to be made by one of the shipping

agents concerned with the importation. The two prosecution witnesses claim that

the Appellant and the 2nd accused have identified the imported machine in their

presence at the Customs warehouse.

As submitted by the learned President's Counsel, the two prosecution

witnesses were suggested that the Appellant did not identify the machine due to

difference in its appearance. This position was denied by the witnesses who

reiterated that the Appellant had identified it. In re-examination it was clarified

from the witnesses that such a position never been put to them by the Appellant

during their investigations.

The Appellant, in his examination in chief stated that he had shipped the

machine in a crate but the machine that one mounted on a palate in the Customs

warehouse was incomplete without its bucket and few other rods and therefore

not the machine he put into sea freight. He also claims the Customs had foisted

the ownership of the machine on him. However, during his cross examination

the Appellant had shifted his position multiple times and finally conceding to the

allegation of the prosecution.

40

Initially the Appellant claimed that he had acted as an intermediary

between the Indian Company and the consignee Company. A contradiction was

marked off his denial that the exporting company is registered under his name in

India. Then the Appellant admitted that it was his scheme to import the machine

and he is the importer.

Another position taken up by the Appellant is that there was another

similar machine in the warehouse. Contrary to this assertion, the Appellant had

thereafter and repeatedly admitted that he had identified the machine at the

Customs as the one he shipped from India. The Appellant had repeated the said

admission once more during cross examination by the 2nd accused.

The trial Court, having evaluated the Appellant's evidence for its

credibility decided not to act on his denial as his was not consistent on his stance

and also on his demeanour in the witness box. It is evident upon perusal of the

judgment of the trial Court that in finding guilty of the Appellant primarily on

the count of importation was based on its conclusion that his position is that he

had no knowledge of the concealed Heroin in the machine he imported. This

approach was not challenged by the Appellant as he himself admitted having

imported the rice pounder that had been taken charge by the Customs. At the

commencement of the trial the parties have agreed under Section 420 that heroin

was detected in the said machine. Therefore, the only disputed question of fact

left to be decided by the trial Court was whether the Appellant has had the

requisite knowledge of the prohibited substance concealed in the said machine.

41

The un-contradicted evidence of the prosecution that the Appellant had

knowledge of an easy way to take out the concealed Heroin from the stainless

steel pipes without drilling into them is a factor sufficient to draw the positive

inference that he did possess the requisite knowledge as envisaged in the offence

of importation of a dangerous drug. His bare denial of any knowledge, as

admitted by the Appellant, is advanced only during the very late stage of his

evidence for the first time.

The prosecution had clearly established a prima facie case against the

Appellant on the counts of importation and attempt to traffic in of Heroin. The

Appellant too had admitted he imported the machine and Heroin was detected

concealed within it. His specific denial of not knowing is contradictory to the

unchallenged evidence on his subsequent conduct.

When the prosecution had established a prima facie case against an

accused in relation to commission of an offence under Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, the applicable legal position has already been

considered by this Court.

Perera J agreed entirely with the submission the learned Senior State

Counsel in Shanmugaraja v Republic of Sri Lanka (1990) 2 Sri L.R. 57, who

contended that;

" the burden was on the prosecution to make out a prima facie

case against the accused which involved proof of both the actus reus

42

~ ,

and the mens rea, in a clear case it would be open to the prosecution

to make out a prima facie case as to the mental element required by

invoking the tentative presumption that a person is deemed to

intend the natural and probable consequences of his act. If the

accused in such a situation did nothing, the prosecu tion may be

held to have discharged its burden in regard to proof of the mental

element necessary to establish liability for the offence. The accused

may however in such circumstances show that he did the act with

some mental element, other than that which the character and

circumstances of the act suggest. The accused may do so and secure

an acquittal, not for the reason that he has proved a defence, but

simply because the prosecution has failed to prove that he

committed the act with the mental element required. In this event

the accused must prove the mental element entertained by him at

the time of his act. "

In the instant appeal the Appellant's position of ignorance as to the

concealed Heroin in the machine was not tenable due to positive evidence

presented by the prosecution as to his knowledge which he opted not to

challenge.

Before this Court part with this judgment, it is appropriate to cite Fernando J in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ranjith Fonseka v Attorney General

(1990) 1 Sri L.R. 50. It is stated in the judgment;

43

, ,

"Learned President's Counsel finally contended that even though

the impugned evidence did not amount to a confession, and even if

it could not reasonably have been so considered by the jury, there

was nevertheless a possibility that the jury might have thought that

the Appellant had made a confessional statement, and that it was

therefore the duty of the learned High Court Judge to direct the jury

that it was not a confession."

In dealing with this contention, Fernando J stated;

"Whether or not, as a counsel of perfection, that might have been

done, there was certainly no duty to do so, and the failure to do so

did not result in any illegality or prejudice to the Appellant. Our

system of criminal justice rightly imposes on the Judiciary an

onerous duty of fairness to the accused, but this duty cannot be

exalted into a barrier which would obstruct the administration of

justice, to the detriment of the victims of crime as well as the

community at large."

In view of the above reasoning, this Court is of the view that the several

grounds of appeal as urged by the learned President's Counsel are devoid of

merit and therefore the appeal of the Appellant ought to be dismissed while

affirming his conviction on both counts of importation and attempt to traffic in of

Heroin.

Accordingly, this Court affirms the conviction of the Appellant on the two

counts of importation and attempt to traffic in of Heroin by the High Court of

Colombo in case No. HC 3448/06.

~~---------------------------------------------------,

Even though, there was no challenge on the sentence of death imposed on

the Appellant during the hearing, when considered against the aggravating

circumstances of executing a well-planned scheme to illicitly import and attempt

to traffic in a large quantity of Heroin, using the Appellant's engineering

knowledge and exposing his long standing family friend. an unsuspecting 2nd

accused, and luring her into that scheme, which cost her liberty and family,

unreservedly deserves the harsh punishment he had been imposed with. Hence,

this Court affirms the sentences of death imposed on the Appellant as the High

Court had imposed.

The appeal of the Appellant is accordingly dismissed.
