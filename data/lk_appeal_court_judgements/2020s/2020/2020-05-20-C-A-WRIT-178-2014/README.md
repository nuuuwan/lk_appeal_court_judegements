Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: A.K. Chandrakantha for the Petitioner.

Anusha Fernando, D.S.G., for the

Respondents.

Argued on: 18.02.2020

Decided on: 13.03.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner, a former petty officer of the Sri Lanka Navy,

was caught in the act of obtaining Rs. 2,500 from a fellow

Navy officer in January 2010, to provide a fraudulent

certificate of residence within the Colombo Municipal limits to

the said officer. The Petitioner claims he intended to pass on

the money so obtained to a clerk attached to the Divisional

4

Secretariat of Colombo, who was in the practice of issuing

such certificates.

Following this incident, the Petitioner was subjected to a

Board of Inquiry, which recommended disciplinary action

against him (as seen from the report dated 22.04.2010

marked P2).

This was followed by a summary trial, where the Petitioner

was tried on two counts: (1) falsifying official documents; and

(2) obtaining gratification to prepare false documents. After

trial, he was found guilty on both counts and sentenced to 90

days imprisonment and also discharged with disgrace from

the Sri Lanka Navy (as seen from the proceedings dated

23.06.2011 marked R3).

The Petitioner filed this application seeking a writ of certiorari

to quash the said punishment as reflected in P1, and a writ of

mandamus for reinstatement with back wages and other

monetary entitlements.

The Petitioner in the petition challenges the decision in P1 on

four grounds:

a) Illegality of the summary trial on the basis of denial of a

fair trial;

b) Illegality of the Board of Inquiry proceedings on the

basis of procedural irregularity;

c) Illegality of the summary trial on the basis of

procedural irregularity;

d) Lack of evidence for the finding of guilt against the

Petitioner.

I will consider each of these grounds separately.

5

The main ground on which the Petitioner seeks to challenge

the decision in P1 is that the summary trial was a sham, as

the conviction and punishment to be imposed on him had

been determined by the Commander of the Navy before the

summary trial was held, as evinced by Minute 17 dated

18.03.2011 contained in the documents compendiously

marked P2a.

This argument taken in isolation is ex facie valid and renders

the proceedings of the summary trial a nullity on breach of

basic principles of natural justice.

However, at the argument, learned Counsel for the Petitioner

candidly admitted that this directive of the Commander of the

Navy contained in the said Minute 17 did not influence the

Petitioner in pleading guilty to count (2) at the summary trial,

as the Petitioner was unaware of such a directive at that time.

This means, the procedural lapse, however serious it may

appear to be, caused no prejudice to the Petitioner in entering

his plea.

The fact thus remains that at the summary trial the Petitioner

pleaded unqualified admission of guilt, of his own accord, to

count 2 obtaining gratification to prepare false documents

(vide R3). He similarly accepted guilt on this count before the

Board of Inquiry (vide P2); and also in his letter dated

05.10.2011 to the President seeking mitigation of his

sentence (vide P4). There can be no dispute then that the

Petitioner was rightly convicted at least on the second count

on which he was charged.

In relation to the first count, during cross examination of the

first witness for the prosecution at the summary trial, the

Petitioner appears to have accepted guilt for falsification of

some but not all of the documents in question (vide R3).

6

Writ being a discretionary remedy, the Court can, in

considering the totality of the matter in issue, overlook any

error, no matter its severity, if it has not caused injustice to

the party applying for writ.

In Seneviratne v. Urban Council, Kegalle [2001] 3 Sri LR 105 at

108, J.A.N. de Silva J. (later C.J.) quoted with approval the

following passage of Judicial Review of Administrative Action

by De Smith (5th Edition, 1995), which states: If the applicant

has not been prejudiced by the matters on which he relies then

the Court may refuse relief even though he has succeeded in

establishing some defect. The literal or technical breach of an

apparently mandatory provision in a Statute may be so

insignificant as not in effect to matter. In these circumstances

the Court may in its discretion refuse relief.

Accordingly, in the unique facts of this case, I take the view

that the Petitioner cannot succeed on the first ground.

I will now consider the second ground on which the Petitioner

canvasses the sentence passed on him.

The Petitioner states in the petition that he was not given an

opportunity to be present at the proceedings of the Board of

Inquiry, nor was he allowed to cross-examine the witnesses

called against him. This, he states, is in violation of

Regulation 13 of the Navy (Board of Inquiry) Regulations

1975, which stipulates: Whenever any inquiry affects the

character or professional reputation of a person subject to

Naval Law, full opportunity shall be afforded to that person of

being present throughout the inquiry, and of making any

statement and or giving any evidence he may wish to make or

give, and of cross-examining any witness whose evidence in

his opinion affects his character or professional reputation and

7

of producing any witnesses in defence of his character or

professional reputation.

The Board of Inquiry is a fact-finding mission. It has only

recommended that disciplinary action be taken against the

Petitioner. It is at the summary trial, at which the Petitioner

actively participated, that the sentence sought to be quashed

was meted out. Hence irregularities, if any, at the Board of

Inquiry proceedings need not be given undue weightage.

The third ground relied upon by the Petitioner relates to

procedural irregularity at the summary trial. The Petitioner

states in the petition that the proceedings of the Board of

Inquiry was used as evidence at the summary trial, which

contravenes Regulation 21 of the Navy (Board of Inquiry)

Regulations 1975: The proceedings of a Board of Inquiry, or

any other confession, statement or answer to a question made

or given at a Board of Inquiry shall, subject to any other law,

not be admissible or given in evidence against any person at

any other inquiry or trial except at the trial of such person for

willfully giving false evidence before the Board.

The Petitioner alleges in the petition that at the summary trial

the first witness for the prosecution had by implication

drawn the attention of the court in respect of the evidence

adduced in the Board of Inquiry. The proceedings of the

summary trial tendered with the Respondents statement of

objections marked R3 reveal that the said witness referred to

the proceedings before the Board of Inquiry only in one of

seven questions put to him by the prosecution and that too

only to provide a sequence of events in his testimony. The

proceedings before the Board of Inquiry were never in the

forefront of the testimony of this witness at the summary trial

and hence the said passing reference can be overlooked.

8

The fourth and final contention of the Petitioner in the

petition is that he has been convicted notwithstanding

insufficient evidence pertaining to his guilt.

In the first place, it is not the task of the Writ Court to

analyse the evidence and ascertain whether or not the

conviction is right or wrong but whether the conviction is

legal or illegal. Vide Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v. Minister of

Labour & Vocational Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at 248-249;

Public Interest Law Foundation v. Central Environmental

Authority [2001] 3 Sri LR 330 at 334.

In any event, this ground cannot be accepted prima facie

given that, as already stated, the Petitioner has repeatedly

admitted guilt in respect of the second charge against him

and appears to have implied his guilt in connection to the

first charge during cross-examination of the first witness of

the prosecution at the summary trial.

At the argument, Counsel for the Petitioner raised

proportionality as a further ground to challenge the sentence

or to buttress his case. There is merit in Counsels argument

particularly given that, as per the Respondents statement of

objections, 13 officers found guilty of soliciting fraudulent

documents received no greater punishment than the issuance

of letters of displeasure. However, in the facts and

circumstances of this case, the Petitioner evidently has a

higher degree of culpability he was the linchpin of the entire

operation, which others were only too keen to use to their

advantage. He cannot expect the same punishment having

played a greater role in the commission of the offence.

The Petitioner preferred an appeal against his conviction and

sentence through the proper channels of the Sri Lanka Navy

to the President (as seen from the letter dated 05.10.2011

9

marked P4). The Respondents have tendered with their

statement of objections the letter dated 06.08.2012 marked

R4 addressed to the Commander of the Navy, by which the

sentence imposed on the Petitioner has been approved by the

President.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents in her

written submissions raises futility as a preliminary objection,

given that (a) the Petitioner has already served the term of

imprisonment imposed on him, and (b) the sentence,

including discharge from the Navy and forfeiture of pay, has

been approved by the President, who is not bound by a

decision of this Court.

There is no doubt that futility is a ground to deny relief to the

Petitioner. In short, if the end result is futile writ will not lie.

In Siddeek v. Jacolyn Seneviratne [1984] 1 Sri LR 83 at 90, the

Supreme Court observed:

The Court will have regard to the special circumstances

of the case before it before issuing a writ of certiorari.

The writ of certiorari clearly will not issue where the end

result will be futility, frustration, injustice and illegality.

Piyadassi Thero v. National Water Supply and Drainage Board

[2011] 2 BLR 470; De Silva v. University Grants Commission

[2011] 2 BLR 474; P.S. Bus Co. Ltd. v. Members and Secretary

of Ceylon Transport Board (1960) 61 NLR 491; Pushpakumara

v. Lt. Commander Wijesuriya [2010] 2 Sri LR 393.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General in her written submissions

cites the case of Brigadier Liyanage v. Chandrananda de

10

Silva, Secretary Ministry of Defence [2000] 1 Sri LR 21, where

the Supreme Court ruled in favour of implementing the

recommendation of the Army Commander to the President to

promote the Petitioner in that case to a higher rank. However,

the order of the Supreme Court was not carried out and the

Petitioner filed an application to the same Court to give effect

to the Judgement. At the second instance, the Supreme Court

made Order as follows:

We are unable to give any further directions other than

what we have already madesince the appointment has

to be made by the President who is not a party to these

proceedings, reliefs are available only against the party

to the proceedings.

Similarly, in the case of Air Vice Marshall Elmo Perera v.

Liyanage [2003] 1 Sri LR 331, the Petitioner challenged the

appointment of the 1st Respondent by the President to inquire

into whether the Petitioner was fit and proper to hold a

Commission in the Air Force. At the inquiry conducted by the

1st Respondent, the Petitioner raised a preliminary objection

that the said appointment was a nullity. This objection was

overruled and the Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to

quash the decision. The Court refused to grant the Petitioner

relief, holding, inter alia, that even if the letter informing the

Petitioner of the appointment of the 1st Respondent was set

aside, the original act of appointment by the President would

still stand. The Court held that writ would not lie if the final

relief sought is futile.

In the instant case, it is not the submission of Counsel for the

Petitioner that the Commander of the Navy did not have the

authority to discharge the Petitioner from service. Nor is it

Counsels submission that the approval of the sentence by

11

the President is faulty or can be reviewed by this Court. In

fact, Counsel admits that so long as the order of approval by

the President remains in effect, the Commander of the Navy

has no authority to reinstate the Petitioner, notwithstanding

a favourable decision by this Court. Counsels submission in

essence is that were this Court to grant this application, the

Petitioner could make a second appeal to the President to

consider the matter afresh.

In Flying Officer Ratnayake v. Commander of the Air Force

[2008] 2 Sri LR 162 this Court quashed by way of certiorari

the decision of the Commander of the Air Force

recommending the withdrawal of the Commission of the

Petitioner, upon him being convicted not by a Court Marshal

but after a Summary Trial, which is incorrect. However, the

Court was not inclined to direct the Respondents by

mandamus to hold a Court Martial afresh, as it would have

been a futile exercise in view of the fact that by that time the

President had approved the withdrawal of the Petitioners

Commission. Nevertheless, the Court further remarked:

This order does not prevent Her Excellency the President

from reconsidering the withdrawal of the Petitioners

Commission, which was based on the recommendation

of the 1st Respondent.

In H.K.U.P. Kavikeshwa v. Lt. Gen. Jagath Jayasooriya,

Commander of the Army (CA/WRIT/260/2011 decided on

03.09.2012), this Court considered the above remark made in

that case and stated: But there is no material placed before

this Court to show that after the said decision of the Court of

Appeal His Excellency has reconsidered his decision. In the

above circumstances this court is of the view that issuing

orders quashing decisions that had been superseded by

12

subsequent orders or decisions which are not challenged is

futile.

The preliminary objection on futility, raised by learned

Deputy Solicitor General, is entitled to succeed.

The application of the Petitioner is dismissed without costs.
