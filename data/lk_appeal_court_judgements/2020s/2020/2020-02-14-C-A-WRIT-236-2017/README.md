Argued on: 07.02.2020

Decided on: 14.02.2020

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Although the prayer to the petition runs into 3 pages (having sub-

paragraphs A-U), the petitioner essentially seeks to quash P12 by

certiorari (thereby invalidating the subsequent actions taken on it).

The complaint of the petitioner based on P12 is that the Commissioner

General of Excise had set up Special Operations Units to carry out

5

raids, which is (a) ultra vires the enabling statutethe Excise

Ordinance, No.8 of 1912, as amended, and (b) a usurpation of the

powers of the Minister in charge of the subject of finance.

The Minister, who is the 8th respondent, and the Commissioner

General of Excise, who is the 1st respondent, deny this.

It is the contention of the petitioner that Special Operations Units can

only be established by the Minister, and the Commissioner General of

Excise has no power to do so.

It is the position of the Commissioner General of Excise that no such

Special Operations Units with perpetual succession were established,

and P12 was only an internal administrative measure taken by the

then Commissioner General of Excise to effectively carry out raids, and

that is all.

I am inclined to accept the explanation of the respondent given the

facts and circumstances of the application.

According to paragraph 3 of the petition, the raids which triggered the

filing of this application were conducted when Mr. L.K.G.

Gunawardena (who issued P12) was functioning as the Commissioner

General of Excise. When this application was filed in September 2017,

Mr. A. Bodaragama was the (Acting) Commissioner General of Excise,

and the petitioner has no complaint against him. Following Mr.

Gunawardenas tenure, it appears several others including Mrs. K.H.A.

Meegasmulla, Mr. H.G. Sumanasinghe, and Mr. R. Semasinghe held

this position. Mr. Bodaragama has now been appointed as the

Commissioner General of Excise on a permanent basis. Based on

what was elicited during the argument, Special Operations Units have

6

ceased to be in operation after Mr. Gunawardenas tenure. This goes

to show that P12 was a temporary internal administrative

arrangement, made by the then Commissioner General of Excise Mr.

Gunawardena, which ended with his retirement or transfer.

As learned State Counsel points out, P12 issued by Mr. Gunawardena

in his capacity as Commissioner General of Excise, is addressed to

Assistant Excise Commissioners, Excise Superintendents and Excise

Officers-in-Charge. As Head of the Department, that is how he

thought successful raids could be carried out to bring the culprits to

book. His predecessors would have adopted different methods, and

his successors adopted and will adopt their own. I see no illegality in

his actions.

For instance, by the document marked CA-4 tendered by the petitioner

with his counter affidavit to fortify his case, it is seen that when Mr. R.

Semasinghe was functioning as Excise Commissioner, he instructed

the Assistant Excise Commissioners to deploy Excise Officers of one

area of authority to different areas, as temporary measures to effect

successful raids. This, in my view, is akin to what Mr. Gunawardena

did in a rigorous manner. But the petitioner has no complaint against

the directive in CA-4 issued in 2018. Learned Presidents Counsel for

the petitioner stated at the argument that the Special Units in

question are no longer in operation (i.e. after the filing of this

application in 2017).

It is further seen by the document marked CA-5 that Mr. Semasinghe

had also set targets to be achieved by Excise Officers with respect to

conducting raids. The petitioner is critical of this approach, saying it

induces Excise Officers to conduct raids with collateral or extraneous

7

considerations. I cannot agree. Targets are set to increase

productivity and efficiency. It is a standard concept adopted by the

private sector to yield results. Why should it be taboo in the

Government sector?

By the document marked 10R-3 with the Statement of the 10th

respondent (not a statement of objections), it is seen that when Mrs.

Meegasmulla functioned as Commissioner General of Excise, she

adopted different methods to achieve these same objectives.

Hence, it is clear that such methods adopted with the aim of

enhancing the efficiency of the Excise Department are provisional in

nature and need not attract the writ jurisdiction of this Court.

According to sections 2 and 7 of the Excise Ordinance, (subject to the

control of the Minister) the Excise Commissioner (later the

Commissioner General of Excise) is the Chief Administrative Officer of

the Excise Department, and the collector of excise revenue.

P4 is a central document to the petitioners case. This document

relates to a raid conducted by a team led by Mr. Tissa Gunaratne,

Officer-in-Charge of the Kandy Excise Special Operations Unit, on

08.07.2016, on a liquor shop owned by the petitioner. The alleged

offence is the sale of liquor in excess of the regulated price.

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner, drawing attention to

Excise Notification 509 published in the Government Gazette dated

22.02.1963 marked P13 (which the Minister issued under section 8 of

the Excise Ordinance), submits that there is no provision which

empowers the Commissioner General of Excise to create such Special

Operations Units or to create the post of Excise Officer-in-Charge. In

8

the hierarchy of the Excise Department, learned Presidents Counsel

submits that there are no Excise Officers-in-Charge created by the

Minister.

This argument is in contradiction with paragraph 9(A) of the counter

affidavit of the petitioner, which recognises the legitimacy of Excise

Officers-in-Charge. This paragraph reads as follows:

At provincial level an Assistant Commissioner of Excise has been

appointed to supervise and overlook the functions and activities of

each province. Under each such Assistant Commissioner, at

District level Superintendents of Excise are appointed and

thereafter, covering all areas of the country, Excise Stations are

established which are headed by an Excise Officers-in-charge,

who administer and regulate the activities in the respective areas

of authority. This is the general administrative arrangement that

has been subsisting for years in the Excise Department, until the

establishment of the purported Special Operations Bureaus;

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner laid emphasis on section

8(b) and (c) of the Excise Ordinance in support of the petitioners case.

Let me quote:

8. The Minister may by notification applicable to the whole of Sri

Lanka or to any district or local area in which this Ordinance is

in force

(b) appoint officers or persons to perform the acts and

duties mentioned in sections 33, 35, and 48(a);

(c) set out the designations, powers and duties of officers

of the Excise Department under the Ordinance;

9

This is to say that only the Minister (and not the Commissioner

General of Excise) has the authority to create designations and confer

powers and duties. I think there is no issue about the Ministers

powers.

In my view, the existing structure allows the Commissioner General of

Excise to act as he did by P12.

By item 2(4) of Excise Notification marked P13, the Minister has given

the following powers to the Officers set out therein:

Assistant Commissioners, Superintendents, Chief Inspectors and

Inspectors, subject to the control of their superior officers, to

exercise the powers referred to in sections 33, 35, 37 and 48(a) of

the Excise Ordinance throughout the Island;

P12, as I said earlier, is addressed to the Assistant Excise

Commissioners, Excise Superintendents and Excise Officers-in-

Charge. The petitioner has accepted the rightfulness of Excise

Officers-in-Charge.

Broadly speaking, section 33 of the Excise Ordinance deals with the

power to enter and inspect places of manufacture, bottling and sale.

Section 35 deals with cases where offenders may be arrested, and

contraband liquor and articles seized without warrant. Section 37

deals with the powers of excise officers to search without a warrant.

Section 48 deals with misconduct by licensees.

The offence disclosed in P4 is covered by item 2(4) of P13. P4 has been

signed by the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Central

Province. This, in my view, is in order.

10

Learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner complains that the

identity of these Special Units is unknown, and that there is no

accountability etc. I am unable to agree. By P4, identity is clearly

given. If I may repeat, the raid was conducted by a team led by Tissa

Gunaratne, Officer-in-Charge of the Excise Special Operations Unit of

Kandy. The raid was conducted under the supervision of the Assistant

Excise Commissioner, who has taken responsibility for it by issuing P4

under his hand.

This was not a Ghost Unit as suggested by the petitioner. This Unit

or Units, which are no more in existence, had carried out similar raids,

as seen from P3 and P11 (the documents tendered by the petitioner

himself) in a transparent manner. P3 and P11 go to show that when

raids had been carried out by this Unit, the Excise Officers entered a

detailed account of how the said raids were carried out in the

Information Books maintained at the licensed premises. Details of the

description/identity of the Excise Officers are all disclosed.

Learned State Counsel for the respondents stressed item 4(1) of P13 to

justify P12. I am in agreement with this justification.

By item 4(1) of P13 the Minister has delegated to the Excise

Commissioner The power to assign to officers of the Excise Department

and Excise Striking Force their respective duties insofar as they are not

specifically provided for by the Excise Ordinance or by rules made

thereunder.

By item 2(4) of P13 quoted above, the Minister conferred powers on the

Assistant Commissioners, Superintendents, Chief Inspectors and

Inspectors referred to in sections 33, 35, 37 and 48(a) of the Excise

Ordinance throughout the Island.

11

By item 4(1) of P13, the Minister has given the authority to the Excise

Commissioner to assign duties to the Officers of the Excise

Department if they have not been specifically provided for.

The Excise Officers to whom P12 was addressed had already been

given powers by the Minister to conduct raids. By P12, the

Commissioner General of Excise only allocated duties to such Officers

as a temporary measure. This is in consonance with the scheme of the

Excise Ordinance. There is no usurpation of the powers of the

Minister.

Learned Presidents Counsel drew the attention of the Court to the

references made in P13 in relation to the Excise Striking Force, to

emphasise that a similar procedure shall be followed in setting up

such Units as well as in conferring powers and duties on such Units.

However, as can be gathered from P13, the Excise Striking Force,

which is no more in existence, did not fully comprise Officers of the

Excise Department. This is clear by reading inter alia items 2(6), 2(7),

4(1) of P13. But the Special Operations Units challenged by the

petitioner comprised only Officers of the Excise Department.

The petitioner tendered a copy of the petition filed in Case No. SC (FR)

219/2016 marked P2 in support of this application, stating that the

case was settled among those petitioners, the former Commissioner

General of Excise Mr. Gunawardena, and the former Minister of

Finance. In the said case, the petitioners challenged the

establishment of a Unit headed by a retired officer of the Sri Lanka Air

Force by the Minister of Finance for the prevention of production and

distribution of illicit liquor, bypassing the Department of Excise.

Although the petitioner in the instant case states in the petition that

12

SC (FR) 219/2016 was settled, he has not tendered a copy of the

settlement. However, the respondents tendered a copy of the said

settlement with their statement of objections marked R2. In my view,

the petitioner did not tender a copy of the settlement because it runs

counter to his argument in this case. Let me only quote the 1st and

2nd conditions upon which the said case was settled.

1. The unit established for the prevention of production and

distribution of illegal liquor, forming the subject matter of this FR

application bearing No.219/2016, shall at all times, function

under the direct control and supervision of the 1st respondent, i.e.,

the Commissioner General of Excise.

2. Furthermore, the unit established for the prevention of production

and distribution of illegal liquor shall exclusively consist of Excise

Officers of the Department of Excise, including a Superintendent of

Excise or an officer holding a post superior to the post of

Superintendent of Excise and of no others.

As evinced from the above, the establishment of such Units to conduct

raids under the direct control and supervision of the Commissioner

General of Excise to curb the sale of illicit liquor has been recognised,

so long as such Units consist of Excise Officers of the Department of

Excise.

It is not the complaint of the petitioner that the Special Units

recognised by P12 consisted of persons other than Excise Officers. As

seen from P3 and P11, the Special Units recognised by P12 consisted

of Excise Officers, not outsiders.

13

After a copy of the settlement in SC (FR) 219/2016 was tendered by

the respondents, the petitioner in the counter affidavit attempted to

disassociate himself with the said case by stating he was not a party to

that case.

The petitioner has not acted with uberrima fides.

At the argument, the position taken on behalf of the petitioner was

that only the Minister has the authority to set up such Special Units

under section 32 of the Excise Ordinance.

I find myself unable to agree with this argument. It is my considered

view that section 32 has no application in this instance. Section 32

empowers the Minister to make Rules in relation to excise revenue.

Section 32(1) reads as follows:

The Minister may make rules for the purpose of carrying out the

provisions of this Ordinance or other law for the time being in

force relating to excise revenue; and all such rules shall be laid as

soon as conveniently may be before Parliament, and upon being

confirmed, with or without modification, by a resolution of

Parliament, and upon such confirmation being notified in the

Gazette, shall have the force of law from the date of such

notification, or upon such date as may be therein fixed:

Provided that in any case of urgency the Minister may by

notification declare any such rules to be in force from a date

named therein, and such rules shall thereupon come in force on

such date; but if within forty days of the date upon which such

rules are laid before Parliament a resolution be passed by

Parliament praying that all or any of such rules be modified or

14

annulled, such rules or rule shall thenceforth be modified or

annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to anything done

there under.

Excise revenue is defined in section 2:

excise revenue means revenue derived or derivable from any

duty, fee, tax, fine (other than a fine imposed by a court of law), or

confiscation imposed or ordered under the provisions of this

Ordinance or of any other law for the time being in force relating

to liquor;

The matter in issue, i.e. setting up ad hoc Special Units comprising

Excise Officers in order to carry out raids to apprehend violators of the

Excise Laws, has no direct bearing on excise revenue, although

increased revenue to the States coffers will be concomitant of

successful raids. It is not the only objective or the only result. There

may be many other objectives/results, such as protecting consumers

from unfair trade practices adopted by unscrupulous licensed liquor

sellers, controlling the consumption of illicit liquor in view of general

health, addressing socio-economic issues, and the desirability of

advancing a just society.

Matters in connection with licence fees, taxes, fines etc. easily fall into

matters of excise revenue, which, inter alia, need Parliament

confirmation followed by Gazette Notification as stipulated by section

32. It is important to remember that subsection (2) of section 32 does

not confer additional powers on the Minister. In other words, it does

not expand the scope of section 32(1), which empowers the Minister to

make Rules relating to excise revenue. Section 32(2) has been

introduced solely to preclude any argument that the subjects stipulated

15

in subsection (2) fall outside the general words conferring the rule-

making power.1 In any event, learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner did not establish that the setting up of Special Units to

conduct raids falls under any particular item of subsection (2).

However, the position taken by the petitioner in the petition is that

such Special Units can be set up by the Minister under section 8 of the

Excise Ordinance.

Paragraphs 43-46 of the amended petition run as follows:

43. The petitioner is advised to state that in terms of section 8 (b)

of the Excise Ordinance No. 08 of 1912, as amended, it is only the

Minister-in-charge of Finance, i.e., the 8th respondent, who is

vested with the power to appoint officers or persons to perform the

acts and duties mentioned in section 33, 35 and 48(a) and

furthermore, under section 8(c), to set out the designations,

powers and duties of officers of the Excise Ordinance under the

Excise Ordinance.

44. Furthermore, as stipulated in the preparatory portion of the

said section 8, when exercising all powers set out therein, the

Minister shall publish a notification, applicable for the whole or

part of Sri Lanka or to any district or local area in which the

Excise Ordinance is in force.

45. The petitioner is advised to state that section 60 of the Excise

Ordinance No 08 of 1912, as amended, provides that every

1 Rajanayagam v. Wijayaratne, Commissioner-General of Excise [1998] 3 Sri LR 129 at 136 per Mark Fernando J.

16

notification issued under the said Ordinance, be published in the

Gazette.

46. However, the petitioner most categorically states that the

purported Excise Special Operations Bureaus of Western and

Central Provinces (which had purportedly raided the petitioners

wine stores respectively on 08/07/2016 and 12/04/2017), is

very simply and clearly, not a lawful unit, appointed by the 8th

respondent, in accordance with section 8 of the Excise Ordinance

No. 08 of 1912, as amended and that it is in gross violation of the

law and indeed a blatant disregard for the law and moreover, of

the fundamental concept of the Rule of Law due process, to inter

alia, permit such an illegal and extra-judicial unit, to be

established, function and continue to function. It is patently

outside the pale of the law and of the governing statute and

clearly needs to be reigned in.

I am mindful that the petitioner in the instant case was not a party to

SC (FR) 219/2016 (P2). But the petitioner himself tendered P2 to

strengthen his case, knowing fully well that he was not a party to the

said case. Therefore, he cannot now, when he realises that it is

unfavourable to him, detach himself from his earlier position. A party

to a judicial proceeding cannot blow hot and cold, affirm and disaffirm,

approbate and reprobate the same transaction simultaneously.

With this in mind, the position taken by the petitioners in SC (FR)

219/2016 (P2) appears to be that collection of excise revenue rests

with the Commissioner General of Excise and not with the Minister.

Paragraph 28 of P2 reads thus:

17

28. The petitioners state that in terms of section 7 of the Excise

Ordinance, the collection of Excise revenue vests with the

Commissioner General of Excise and he is empowered to excise

all or any powers and perform all or any powers of the

Government Agent (District Secretary) under the Excise Ordinance,

either concurrently or independent to the Government Agent.

Accordingly, the Commissioner General has the power to inter

alia; A) issue passes for import, export or transport of excisable

articles in terms of section 14; B) establish or authorize the

establishment of distilleries and breweries for manufacture of

liquor, subject to conditions- in terms of section 16(a); C) establish

or authorize the establishment of warehouses wherein any

excisable article may be deposited- in terms of section 16(b); D)

grant exclusive privilege of manufacture and/or supply and/or

sale of any country liquor- in terms of section 19; and E) grant

exclusive privilege for sale of foreign liquor by retail, in a tavern

within any local areas in terms of section 19(d).

Further, the position of the petitioners in SC (FR) 219/2016 (P2) is

that the establishment of such Units by the Minister is a usurpation of

the powers of Excise Officers. Paragraphs 71(B), (C), (H) read as

follows:

(B) The Department of Excise is the sole and exclusive

governmental authority/functionary, established to carry out the

powers and functions of the Excise Ordinance No. 08 of 1912, as

amended and therefore, the purported establishment and

functioning of the purported unit for the prevention of the

production and distribution of illegal liquor, outside the purview of

the Excise Department is ex facie illegal and bad in law;

18

(C) Section 7(a) of the Excise Ordinance No. 08 of 1912, as

amended, vests the exclusive power to collect excise revenue, with

the 1st respondent and therefore, collection of revenue by the

purported establishment of the unit for the prevention of

production and distribution of illegal liquor, headed by the 64th

respondent, amounts to a patent violation of the said statutory

provision and moreover, an usurpation of statutory powers of the

1st respondent;

(H) The establishment and continued functioning of the said

purported Unit is manifestly illegal, in as much as inter alia it

constitutes an usurpation of the powers of the Excise officers who

have been duly appointed;

It is clear there are contradictions inter se and per se! Writ being a

discretionary remedy, the conduct of the party applying is relevant.

I see no illegality or ultra vires of the Excise Ordinance or usurpation

of powers of the Minister in setting up Special Operations Units

comprising Excise Officers, as contemplated in P12, which was

adopted by the then Commissioner General of Excise (and is now

admittedly defunct), as a temporary internal arrangement to bring

offenders to book.

The application of the petitioner is dismissed with costs.
