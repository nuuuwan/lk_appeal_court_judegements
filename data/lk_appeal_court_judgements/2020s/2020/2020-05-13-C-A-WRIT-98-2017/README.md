When this matter was taken up for argument on 4th June 2019, the learned

Counsel for the parties moved that they be permitted to file further written

submissions and for this Court to pronounce its judgment on the written

submissions tendered by the parties.

The facts of this application very briefly are as follows.

The Petitioner states that in terms of an agreement that it had with Sri Lanka

Port Management and Consultancy Services (Private) Limited, a subsidiary of

the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, the Petitioner had undertaken to provide a

service known as 'Seal checking and Container Survey Services'. The said

agreement, apparently entered into in 2004, had been extended several times

and was valid until 31't December 2017.

The Petitioner states further that by a letter dated 8th June 2015, annexed to

the petition marked 'P2', the Sri Lanka Port Management and Consultancy

Services (Private) Limited had informed the Petitioner that a decision had been

taken to stop the provision of the said services obtained through third parties

and that the provision of such services in terms of the said agreement shall be

terminated with immediate effect. The Petitioner in turn had terminated the

services of the 3rd -20th Respondents who had been employed by the

Petitioner to provide the said services under the said agreement.

The 3rd - 20th Respondents had thereafter complained to the Department of

Labour that the termination of their employment is contrary to the provisions

4

of the Termination of Employment (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971, as

amended, (the TEW Act).

It would perhaps be appropriate to consider at the outset, the provisions of

the TEW Act. Section 2(1} of the TEW Act provides that:

"No employer shall terminate the scheduled employment of any warkman

without-

(a) the prior consent in writing of the workman; or

(b) the prior written approval of the Commissioner."

Section 5 of the TEW Act, which reads as follows, sets out the consequences of

terminating the employment of a workman outside the above procedure:

"Where an employer terminates the scheduled employment of a

workman in contravention of the provisions of this Act, such termination

shall be illegal, null and void, and accordingly shall be of no effect

whatsoever."

Section 6 of the TEW Act sets out the power of the 1st Respondent where the

employment of a workman is terminated in contravention of the Act. Section 6

reads as follows:

"Where an employer terminates the scheduled employment of a

workman in contravention of the provisions of this Act, the Commissioner

may order such employer to continue to employ the workman, with effect

from a date specified in such order, in the same capacity in which the

5

workman was employed prior to such termination, and to pay the

workman his wages and all other benefits which the workman would have

otherwise received if his services had not been so terminated; and it shall

be the duty of the employer to comply with such order. The Commissioner

shall cause notice of such order to be served on both such employer and

the workman."

It is not in dispute that the Petitioner did not have the prior consent in writing

of the employees nor had the Petitioner sought approval from the

Commissioner General of Labour, and therefore, on the face of it, the

provisions of Section 2(1) of the TEW Act have been violated by the Petitioner.

It would however appear that Sections 2, 5 and 6 contain an important

limitation to the application of the TEW Act, namely that the workman must be

in a scheduled employment. The phrase, 'scheduled employment' has been

defined in Section 19 of the TEW Act and reads as follows:

"Scheduled employment means employment in -

(a) any trade, in respect of which a notification has been published in the

Gazette under subsection (2) of section 6 of the Wages Boards

Ordinance of an order made under subsection (1) of that section and

shall include the work of any worker referred to therein but excluded

from the provisions of such order;

(b) every shop and every office within the meaning of the Shop and

Office Employees (Regulation of Employment and Remuneration) Act;

or

6

(c) every factory within the meaning of the Factories Ordinance."

The Department of Labour had initiated an inquiry into the said complaint of

the 3'd -20th Respondents. At the commencement of the inquiry, the

Petitioner had raised the following two preliminary objections:

(a) The Petitioner is not the employer of the 3'd - 20th Respondents;

(b) The provisions of the TEW Act does not apply to the Petitioner, as the

employees were not in a scheduled employment.

By his decisions annexed to the petition marked 'P12' and 'P13', the Inquiry

Officer had overruled the said objections, and proceeded with the inquiry, at

which the employees and the Petitioner had been provided with an

opportunity of leading evidence. This Court must observe at this stage that the

Petitioner is not complaining of any irregularity in the manner in which the

inquiry was conducted.

After the conclusion of the inquiry, the Commissioner General of Labour had

conveyed his decision to the Petitioner by letter dated 13th December 2016,

annexed to the petition marked 'P9'. By the said decision, the Petitioner was

directed to pay a sum of Rs. 3,050,000 to the employees as compensation in

terms of Section 60 of the TEW Act. The relevant portions of the said letter are

re-produced below:

Aggrieved by the decision in 'P9', the Petitioner filed this application seeking

inter alia a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision contained in 'P9'.

The only ground urged by the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner at

the hearing before this Court was that the provisions of the TEW Act does not

apply to the Petitioner for the reason that the services provided by the said

employees do not fall under a Wages Board established under the Wages

Board Ordinance. The issue that arises for the determination of this Court

therefore is whether the 3'd -20th Respondents are in a Scheduled

Employment and if so, whether the provisions of the TEW Act would apply to

the 3'd - 20th Respondents.

The starting point in determining the above issue is the aforementioned

definition of 'scheduled employment' . There is no dispute that paragraphs (b)

and (c) of the said definition do not apply to the employees of the Petitioner. It

is the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that its

employees do not fall under paragraph (a) as well, for the reason that, even

though a Wages Board has been established in 1947 for the "Dock, Harbour

and Port Transport Trade" in terms of the Wages Board Ordinance in 1948,

there is no specific category in the said Order covering employees who carry

out 'Seal checking and Container Survey Services' and therefore, the work

carried out by the said employees do not come within the notification made

under the Wages Board for the 'Dock, Harbour and Port Transport Trade' set

up under the Wages Board Ordinance. The learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner relied on the evidence of the Assistant Commissioner of Labour, Ms.

Sanda mali Walpita who had stated that the relevant order under the Wages

9

Board Ordinance, annexed to the petition marked 'Pll' does not have a

specific category of employees by the name of seal checkers.

In support of his argument that the work carried out by the 3rd -20th

Respondents was not covered by 'Pll', the learned President's Counsel for the

Petitioner referred to the fact that 'Pll' was introduced in 1947 at a time

when containerized cargo was not even dreamt of, and all goods were loaded

on board manually, whereas today, hardly does any shipment of break bulk

cargo takes place, with almost everything being packed in containers. He

therefore submitted that the services performed by the 3rd - 20th Respondents

have not been contemplated by 'Pll', and that it is not the function of this

Court to usurp the function of the legislature in the thin guise of interpretation.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Commissioner

General of Labour drew the attention of this Court to the document annexed

to the petition marked 'Pll' which the Petitioner admits is the Gazette

Notification published when the Wages Board relating to "Dock, Harbour and

Port Transpart Trade" was established. The Order under Section 6 of the

Wages Board Ordinance declaring the "Dock, Harbour and Port Transport

Trade" as a Trade to which the Ordinance would apply had been published in

Gazette No. 9790 dated 24th October 1947. The Order under Section 8 of the

Ordinance establishing a Wages Board for the said Trade had been published in

Gazette No 9863 dated 14th May 1948.

Prior to considering the submission of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General on the applicability of 'Pll' to the 3rd - 20th Respondents, it would be

useful to understand the nature of the employment of the 3rd -20th

1 Storekeepers, Assistant Storekeepers (wharf and warehouse). Supervisors and Assistant Supervisors (exports and imports).

2 Landing Clerks, Tally Clerks, Examining Clerks, Wharf Clerks, Lighter Clerks, Cart chit Clerks, Warehouse clerks, muster Clerks, Shipping Clerks, Pass writers, delivery, dispatch, clearing, receipt and Store Clerks.

3 Landing men, delivery men, slingers, warehouse stackers, Checkers and kanganies (bag and general cargo).

Respondents. Such an exercise would also assist this Court to ascertain if the

conclusion reached by the Inquiry Officer is supported by the evidence that

was led before him. This Court has therefore examined the evidence given by

the workmen as well by the Petitioner. The answers given by some of the

witnesses with regard to the nature of the work carried out by them is re-

produced below:

The above answers makes it clear that the containers, once off loaded from

the vessel, are examined by the 3rd - 20th Respondents to verify if the seals are

intact, prior to being released by the port operator. The employees are also

required to prepare a report where they would record details of the containers

where the sea is are damaged . Thus, the task performed by the said

Respondents is to examine and/or check the containers and prepare a report.

0d November 201S.

S Vide proceedings of 20d February 2016; page 176.

12

The submission of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the 1st and

2nd Respondents was two-fold.

His first argument was that it is not necessary for each and every category of

employee who may be performing a service referred to in such Order, to be

referred to specifically by designation, and that all that is required to be

covered by 'Pll' is for the type of service performed by an employee to be

related to the loading and unloading of cargo. In support of this argument, he

referred to the following wording at Item (9) above of 'Pll' -"elllOO@Cl ~~

(5l;~ (!Jei>l elllOOa5 ~ ~tC) ~)(;))() ~ell~ ~ (!Jei>l tl)~ (!Jei>l ~~

~<3".

His second argument was that Landing Clerks, Tally Clerks, Examining Clerks,

Checkers etc are specifically covered by 'P11' - vide page 3 of 'Pll' - and that

the 3'd - 20th Respondents, by carrying out Seal checking and Container Survey

Services are in fact functioning as Examining Clerks or Checkers. He submitted

further that the 3rd - 20th Responde'nts can be categorized under 'Examining

Clerk', as well as under 'Checkers', which categories of employees are provided

in 'Pll', and therefore submitted that the 3rd -20th Respondents are well

within the categories of workers referred to in 'Pll'. Therefore he submitted

that the said employees belonged to a 'scheduled employment' and the

provisions of the TEW Act applied to the 3rd - 20th Respondents.

This Court is in agreement with the submission of the learned Senior Oeputy

Solicitor General for two reason s. The first is this Court is satisfied that the

work carried out by the 3rd - 20th Respondents is to examine and/or check the

13

containers on shore, once they are taken off the vessel. The said employees

are performing the task of an 'Examining Clerk' or a 'Checker' which is

specifically referred to in page 3 of 'Pll', and therefore the provisions of 'Pll'

would apply to the 3rd - 20th Respondents.

The second is that it is impossible to specify by designation, the categories of

workers who should come within a particular Wages Board, for the reason that

a trade may evolve over a period of time. In fact, the Assistant Commissioner

of Labour, Mrs. Walpita, while admitting that there is no specific designation

for 'seal checkers' has stated as follows:6

"o6)oJ@ell =~ @c:Se:JJ erJOOIIDal @QlJ ~cl@e!S o6)oJ@ell =l@) ell CDO ffi@Q)e!)

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the decision of the

Inquiry Officer in 'P12', and conveyed by 'P9', that the Wages Board for the

Dock, Harbour and Port Transport Trade applies to the 3rd - 20th Respondents is

supported by 'Pii'. It is the view of this Court that the said decision is

therefore not only legal, but is also reasonable rationale. It is a decision that

any sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided

could have arrived at it. 7

14

Having come to the conclusion that the aforementioned decision of the

Commissioner General of Labour that the 3rd - 20th Respondents were engaged

in a scheduled employment is legal and reasonable, this Court shall now

consider the provisions of the TEW Act in order to determine whether the

decision of the 1st Respondent to pay compensation is legal and reasonable.

In Mahaweli Reach Hotels PLC vs Wijeweera, Commissioner General of

Labour and OthersB this Court considered the question of whether the only

consequence of a termination of employment in violation of Section 2(1) of the

TEW Act is reinstatement with back wages, or whether the Commissioner

General of Labour has in fact been conferred a discretion by Section 6; and if

so, whether in exercising that discretion, the Commissioner of Labour can

order the payment of compensation as opposed to reinstatement.

Having considered the judgments of this Court that had taken a very strict view

of Section 6 of the TEW Ace - i.e. reinstatement follows a termination of

service contrary to Section 2(1) - and the judgments of this Court and the

Supreme Court that have taken a . more liberal or practical view that

reinstatement is not mandatory,lO this Court held as follows:

"Applying the rationale laid down in the judgments referred to obove, this

Court is of the view that the use of the word 'may' in Section 6 of the TEW

Act does in fact confer the Commissioner General of Labour a discretion on

whether to order reinstatement with back wages or to limit the relief to

compensation. This Court is further of the view that the termination of

employment of an employee contrary to the provisions of Section 2(1) of

the TEW Act would under normal circumstances attract reinstatement

with back wages, as provided for in Section 6. However, there con be

exceptional situations as have arisen in the judgments referred to above,

which justify the Commissioner General of Labour making an order for

compensation. This Court is therefore of the view that while reinstatement

with back wages should be the norm, awarding of compensation,

depending on the facts and circumstances of each case, should be the

exception."

The decision of the 1st Respondent to award compensation in lieu of

reinstatement has been taken in view of the fact that the Petitioner no longer

has a contract to provide the services that it had undertaken to provide in

terms of the agreement it had with Sri Lanka Port Management and

Consultancy Services Limited, and would fall under the exception referred to

above. In this background, this Court is in agreement with the decision that

reinstatement is not practical, nor feasible. Furthermore, the 1st Respondent

has taken Rs. 10,000 as the monthly salary of the said employees, which is the

minimum salary stipulated by the Wages Board for the Dock, Harbour and Port

Transport Trade, whereas the evidence at the inquiry revealed that the

employees were drawing a salary of approximately Rs. 21,000. In these

circumstances, this Court is of the view that the decision of the 1st Respondent

to award compensation in terms of Section 60, and the quantum of

compensation, is reasonable.

16

In the above circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is not

entitled to the relief sought. This application is accordingly dismissed, without

costs.
