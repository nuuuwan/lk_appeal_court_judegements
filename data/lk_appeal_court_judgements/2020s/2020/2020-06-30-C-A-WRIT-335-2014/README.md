Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief: 1

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the imposition of the Special Commodity

Levy on Potatoes and B Onions by the document annexed to the petition

marked X2; and

(b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to refund to the

Petitioner the excess sums of money that were levied in terms of X2.

1 When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner informed this Court that he will only be pursuing the said relief, which has been prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (e) of the prayer.

4

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

The Special Commodity Levy Act No. 48 of 2007 (the Act) was introduced in

2007 to simplify the tax structure on commodity items imported into Sri Lanka.

This is reflected in its preamble which states that it is an Act to provide for the

imposition of a composite levy on certain specified commodity items in lieu of

the amount chargeable on such commodity items as a tax, duty, levy, cess or

any other charge in order to overcome the complexities associated with the

application and administration of multiple taxes on such specified commodity

items ....

In terms of the Act, the Special Commodity Levy (the Levy) was to be

applicable in lieu of the taxes that are imposed on imported goods in terms of

the laws specified in the Schedule to the Act.2

The manner in which the Levy is to be imposed by the Minister is set out in

Section 2(1) of the Act, which reads as follows:

From and after the date of the coming into operation of this Act, there

shall be imposed a levy to be called the Special Commodity Levy on

certain commodity items which shall from time to time be specified by the

Minister by Order published in the Gazette.

The Petitioner states that the Minister of Finance and Planning had accordingly

made the following two Orders under Section 2(1) of the Act:

2 The laws specified in the Schedule are as follows: Finance Act No. 11 of 2002 (Part 1); Value Added Tax Act, No. 14 of 2002; Finance Act No. 5 of 2005 (Part I); Customs Ordinance (Chapter 235); Sri Lanka Export Development Act, No. 40 of 1979; Excise (Special Provisions) Act, No. 13 of 1989.

5

a) Order published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 1875/17 dated 11th August

2014, annexed to the petition marked X4A, imposing the Levy at the rate

of Rs. 5 per kg of B Onions;

b) Order published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 1875/30 dated 14th August

2014, annexed to the petition marked X4B, imposing a levy at the rate of

Rs. 15 per kg of Potatoes.

It is agreed between the parties that the Orders X4A and X4B were valid for

a period of four months, effective 12th August 2014 and 15th August 2014,

respectively.

The Petitioner states that while X4A and X4B were in force, the 4th

Respondent, the Director General of Trade Investment and Policy, Ministry of

Finance and Planning had issued the document annexed to the petition

marked X2 on 22nd August 2014, at 1740 hours, seeking to increase the Levy

that had been imposed by X4A and X4B, in the following manner:

This Court has examined X2 and observes the following endorsements that

have been made thereon:

6

a) Directive by the 4th Respondent to the 5th Respondent, the Director

General of Customs to Please implement the above rates with effect from

midnight today;

b) Directive by the Additional Director General of Customs (Revenue and

Services) to the Directors of Customs (ICT) and (PP&R), To take

immediate action to effect the above two changes from 12midnight

(22/08 23/08). This directive had been made at 1845 hrs of 22nd August

2014.

The Petitioner has produced with its petition, marked X6, Departmental

Order No. DOPL 945 issued by the Director General of Customs, informing all

Officers of Sri Lanka Customs that, General Treasury has informed the DGC

that the Special Commodity Levy rates have been revised ... effective from

23.08.2014, with the revised rates being Rs. 35 for B Onions and Rs. 40 for

Potatoes.

The Petitioner has produced with its counter affidavit a letter sent by Sri Lanka

Customs confirming that the above revision was duly published on the website

of Sri Lanka Customs on 23rd August 2014. It is agreed between the parties that

Sri Lanka Customs implemented the rates conveyed by X2 from 23rd August

2014. It is also agreed between the parties that in order to impose the above

revised rates, the Orders X4A and X4B were cancelled by the Minister and a

fresh Order under Section 2(1) of the Act was made in respect of the revised

rates.3

3 The date on which the said Order was signed by the Minister has been disputed by the Petitioner.

7

The Petitioner, who is an importer of commodities, had submitted two

Customs Declarations marked X8A and X8B on 5th September 2014 in

respect of 32000 kg and 32800 kg of Potatoes, respectively. The Levy payable

on potatoes has been declared in the said Customs Declarations at the rate

specified in X2 and X6 and the Petitioner had paid the levy calculated at the

rate of Rs. 40 per kg, and cleared the said consignments.

Having done so, the Petitioner filed this application, complaining to this Court

that the imposition of the Levy in terms of X2 is illegal and therefore seeking

inter alia the aforementioned relief.

Prior to considering the arguments advanced in this Court by the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner, it would be appropriate for this Court to set out the

submission of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General as to the reasons

that led to the increase of the Levy on 22nd August 2014.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General submitted that this Court must

consider the Act as a whole and that this Court should not seek to interpret

provisions of the Act in isolation. He submitted that while the Act has been

introduced to simplify the tax structure on commodity items, the economic

and market reality is such that the Government must be in a position to

impose the Levy when required and thereafter be in a position to amend

and/or cancel same without any restrictions, other than those specified in

Section 2(3) or Section 2(4).

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General submitted further that it is the

responsibility of the Minister of Finance to take decisions in the interests of the

8

national economy and the agricultural sector of the Country. He pointed out

that B Onions and Potatoes are two crops cultivated by local farmers and their

livelihood depends on the income they generate from farming these

commodities. He submitted that whenever the harvest in Sri Lanka is higher

than expected, there can be a glut in the market if imports are allowed.

Therefore he submitted, in order to minimise imports during the post harvest

period, the Government increases the Levy thereby protecting the local

farmer, and ensuring that their crop has a ready market.

Similarly, he submitted that there can be situations where the harvest may not

be as expected or where the harvest is affected by floods or other natural

causes, agricultural pests etc, which can result in a shortage of the commodity

in the market, thereby increasing the price. He submitted that in such a

situation, the Government steps in and lowers the Levy, thereby allowing the

importation of these two important commodities at a lower price and ensuring

the continuous supply of B Onions and Potatoes at a reasonable price. In

support of this position, the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General drew the

attention of this Court to Section 5(1) of the Act, where the Minister may,

when he is of the opinion that in view of the prevailing economic conditions it

is expedient to do so, waive the levy specified in an order made under Section

2, while an Order made under Section 2 (1) or (3) is in force. He therefore

submitted that the Act does not prohibit an Order under Section 2(1), once

made, from being cancelled prior to the expiry of its validity period, in order to

address the economic considerations that prevail at a particular time.

Referring to the facts of this application, the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General stated that the Minister of Finance, having published the Orders X4A

9

and X4B on 11th August 2014 and 14th August 2014 respectively, had to

contend with a bumper harvest in the country soon thereafter. Therefore, in

order to protect the local producer, as part of Government Policy, the Minister

of Finance was compelled to increase the Levy on Potatoes and B Onions in

order to control the import of these two commodities. Hence, the necessity to

increase the Levy on 22nd August 2014.

This Court shall now consider the two arguments of the learned Counsel

Petitioner.

The first argument is that once an Order is made in terms of Section 2(1) of the

Act, such Order cannot be amended or rescinded for a period of thirty days

therefrom. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner is relying on the provisions

of Section 2(4) of the Act in support of his argument. It was his position that

the Order marked X4B increasing the Levy in respect of Potatoes, having

come into effect on 15th August 2014, could not have been amended and/or

rescinded until 13th September 2014. He therefore submitted that the

imposition of a revised Levy as reflected in X2 prior to the expiry of the said

thirty day period, is ultra vires the powers of the Minister and is therefore

illegal.

Determination of the first argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

requires this Court to consider the provisions of Sections 2(1) 2(4) of the Act.

This Court has already noted that the Order specifying the commodity in

respect of which the Levy should apply is made by the Minister in terms of

Section 2(1) of the Act.

10

In terms of Section 2(2), The period of validity of every such Order and the rate

of the Special Commodity Levy to be imposed in respect of each such specified

item, either on ad valorem or specific basis, shall also be specified in the

Order. It is clear from the wording of Section 2(2) that while every Order

made under Section 2(1) shall have a validity period, there is no requirement

that the Order made under Section 2(1) must have a minimum validity period.

The question whether an Order made under Section 2(1) can be amended is

addressed in Section 2(3), which is re-produced below:

Every Order made under subsection (1) which is valid for a period of over

thirty days, may be amended or varied by adding thereto or removing

therefrom any item or by revising the rates specified therein.

Thus, while an Order made under Section 2(1) can be valid for a period of less

than thirty days, any Order which is valid for a period of over thirty days can be

amended, or varied, in respect of two matters, namely by adding or removing a

commodity from such Order, or by revising the rate of the Levy specified in

such Order.

Section 2(4) of the Act specifies that, No Order made under subsection (3)

may be amended or varied until the expiration of thirty days from the date of

the making thereof.

Thus, there are two Orders that can be made in terms of Section 2 of the Act.

The first is an Order under Section 2(1) imposing the Levy on a commodity

specified in such Order at the rate and for the period specified therein. The

11

second is an Order under Section 2(3), amending an Order made under Section

2(1). It is significant to note that the Order that has been referred to in Section

2(4) in respect of which the limitation set out therein would apply, is an Order

made under Section 2(3) of the Act, and not an Order made under Section 2(1).

As noted earlier, the effect of Section 2(2) is that while every Order under

Section 2(1) must have a validity period, it is not mandatory that a minimum

validity period be specified for such an Order. However, where the validity

period has been specified as being more than thirty days, as in X4A and X4B,

such an Order can be amended, but only in respect of the two matters

specified therein. An Order under Section 2(3) cannot extend the validity

period of the Order made under Section 2(1) that it is seeking to amend.

However, no such restriction would apply to a fresh Order made under Section

2(1), thereby distinguishing between an amendment and a cancellation. The

inference that may be drawn here is that the legislature has not conferred the

Minister with the power to amend an Order which is valid for a period of less

than thirty days. What is important however is that a plain reading of Section

2(3) shows that it does not specify that the amendment can be done only after

a certain number of days have lapsed after an Order under Section 2(1) has

come into force, with the resultant position being that the rate of the Levy

specified in X4A and X4B can be amended any time after 12th August 2014

and 15th August 2014, respectively.

Although the Act provides for the amendment of an Order made under Section

2(1), the Act does not provide for the cancellation of an Order. The power to

cancel an order is clearly provided for in Section 18 of the Interpretation

Ordinance, which reads as follows:

12

Where any enactment, whether passed before or after the

commencement of this Ordinance, confers power on any authority to issue

any proclamation, or make any order or notification, any proclamation,

order, or notification so issued or made may be at any time amended,

varied, rescinded, or revoked by the same authority and in the same

manner, and subject to the like consent and conditions, if any, by or in

which or subject to which such proclamation, order, or notification may be

issued or made.

Therefore, an Order made under Section 2(1) can be cancelled at any time and

a fresh Order made in lieu thereof, in the absence of any restriction or

prohibition in the Act relating to cancellation.

It is therefore the view of this Court that:

(a) The argument that the Orders marked X4A and X4B cannot be

amended or cancelled for a period of thirty days from the date of such

Order becoming operational, is not correct.

(b) The restriction on amending or varying an order contained in Section 2(4)

applies only with regard to an Order made under Section 2(3) of the Act.

As the Order that has been made by the Minister on 22nd August 2014 is

not an Order under Section 2(3) but is an Order made under Section 2(1),

the restriction contained in Section 2(4) of the Act will not apply to such

Order.

13

There is one matter that this Court wishes to advert to, which is the judgment

of this Court in Deepak Kumar Krishnakumar Vasanji vs Hon. Ravi

Karunanayke, Minister of Finance and Others.4 In that case, an Order in terms

of Section 2(1) of the Act had been published in Extraordinary Gazette No.

1931/7 dated 7th September 2015, whereby the Levy in terms of the Act was

imposed on B Onions for a period of 6 months from 8th September 2015.

While the said Order was in force, the Minister of Finance had published an

Order under Section 10A of the Customs Ordinance, in Extraordinary Gazette

No. 1933/15 dated 22nd September 2015, imposing a surcharge, in addition to

the Levy. The complaint of the petitioner was that in terms of Section 2(5) of

the Act,5 no other tax can be imposed on any good under the Customs

Ordinance while an Order made under Section 2(1) of the SCL Act subsists.

As in this application, the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General who

appeared for the respondents in that application submitted that the necessity

to revise the Special Commodity Levy either upwards or downwards may arise

at any time, and that the Government must be able to react in order to protect

the national economy. The submission of the respondents that the mechanism

that is available in order to address an excess harvest is to act under Section

10A of the Customs Ordinance and to impose a surcharge was accepted by this

Court. Although this Court did not consider the provisions of Sections 2(1)

2(4) in that application, upon a close analysis of those provisions, it is clear that

the Government may address an increase necessitated by economic

4 CA (Writ) Application No. 69/2016; CA Minutes of 7th November 2019. 5 Section 2(5) reads as follows: The Special Commodity Levy so imposed shall be a composite levy and during the period any Order published in terms of subsection (1) is in force, no other tax, duty, levy or cess or any other charge imposed in terms of any of the laws specified in the Schedule to this Act, shall be applicable in respect of the commodity items specified in any such Order.

14

considerations, by the procedure adopted by the Respondents in this

application, as well.

This Court shall now consider the second argument of the learned Counsel for

the Petitioner, which is twofold. The first is that the revision of the Levy as set

out in X2 has been made by the Director General, Department of Trade and

Investment Policy and not by the Minister of Finance, as required by Section

2(1) of the Act. The second is that the Order made by the Minister has not

been published in the Gazette, prior to the implementation of the Levy, and

therefore the imposition of the Levy at the rate of Rs. 40 is illegal.

Common to both aspects of the second argument are the provisions of Section

7 of the Act, which reads as follows:

Every Order made by the Minister in terms of Section 2 and Section 5,

shall

(i) be in operation immediately upon the Minister affixing his signature

thereto;

(ii) be published in the Gazette as soon as convenient;

(iii) be approved by Resolution of Parliament as soon as convenient

thereafter; and

(iv) if not approved by Parliament, be deemed to be rescinded with effect

from the date of such resolution, without prejudice to anything

previously done thereunder.

15

It is clear that in terms of Section 2(1) of the Act, the power to make an Order

in terms thereof is vested with the Minister. The learned Counsel for the

Petitioner drew the attention of this Court to X2 and stated that X2 does not

contain anything thereon to indicate that the decision to impose a levy at a

new rate has been taken by the Minister. This Court has examined X2 and is

in agreement with the position of the Petitioner.

In support of his position that the decision to impose an increased levy has not

been taken by the Minister, the Petitioner has annexed to its counter affidavit,

marked X19, a letter dated 22nd March 2017 issued by the Department of

Immigration and Emigration confirming that the then Minister of Finance had

left Sri Lanka on 22nd August 2014. The time of departure however has not

been stated in X19.

It is in this factual background that the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that the Order X2 has not been issued by the Minister of Finance

but has in fact been issued by the 4th Respondent, without any Order to that

effect having been made by the Minister. If the position of the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner is correct, the collection of the Levy at the rate specified in

the two Customs Declarations (X8A) is illegal.

As noted earlier, the Petitioner has produced marked X4A, the Gazette

notification containing the Order made by the Minister on 11th August 2014

imposing a Levy of Rs. 25 on B Onions. Annexed to X4A is the Order signed by

the Minister. Similarly, annexed to the Gazette notification marked X4B is the

Order signed by the Minister imposing a sum of Rs. 15 per kg of potatoes.

16

The Petitioner has produced with his counter affidavit, marked X15, the

actual Order signed by the Minister of Finance on 22nd August 2014, declaring

that the two previous Orders made in respect of B Onions and Potatoes (i.e.

X4A and X4B) are cancelled and that effective 23rd August 2014, the Special

Commodity Levy on Potatoes shall be Rs. 40. This Court has examined X15

and observes that it contains the signature of the Minister, the commodities in

respect of the which the Levy is to be collected, the rate at which the Levy is to

be collected, the period for which the Order shall be valid, and is dated 22nd

August 2014. Thus, on the Petitioners own pleadings, there is an Order signed

by the Minister on 22nd August 2014. No material has been placed before this

Court to show that the Order X15 was not available to the 4th Respondent at

the time he issued X2. Furthermore, as is evident by the Petitioners pleadings

referred to earlier, the practice appears to be for the Minister to sign the Order

and thereafter for the Ministry of Finance to implement the Order.

An Order for the imposition of the Levy comes into operation immediately

upon the Minister signing such Order. Implementation of the said Order is in

the hands of the Ministry of Finance and Sri Lanka Customs. The contents of

X2 make it clear that X2 has been issued by the 4th Respondent to the 5th

Respondent to enable the rates specified in the Order X15 to be

implemented. On receipt of X2, Sri Lanka Customs is entitled to impose the

levy at the rate specified therein from the date specified therein. In these

circumstances, the only conclusion that this Court can arrive at is that X2 has

been issued pursuant to the Order X15 having been issued under the hand of

the Minister of Finance.

17

The second aspect of the argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is

that the imposition of the Levy cannot be done until the Order is published in

the Gazette. The attention of this Court was drawn to the fact that even

though X2 had been issued on 22nd August 2014, and the number of the

Gazette in which the said Order was to be published has been stated on X2 as

being No. 1876/42 dated 22nd August 2014, even as at the date on which this

application was filed, the said Order had not been published in the Gazette. In

support of his position, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner has produced

marked X3, a list of Gazettes printed by the Government Printer for the

month of August 2014.

This Court has examined X3 and observes that even though No. 1876/42

appears on it, X3 does not contain details of what has been published, and

only states that the particular gazette number has been reserved for the

Department of Trade and Policy. The Department of Government Printing has

in fact confirmed to the Petitioners Attorney-at-Law by a letter dated 20th

December 2016 marked X16 that the manuscript for the said Gazette No.

1876/42 was received only on 1st October 2014 and the Gazette was published

on the web site only on 11th October 2014. Having considered the above

material, it is clear to this Court that even though X2 had been issued on 22nd

August 2014, and the Order had in fact been published in Gazette No. 1876/42

bearing the date 22nd August 2014, the Order has been sent for publication

only on 1st October 2014.6 While such a practice is irregular, what is important

is that in terms of Section 7, publication of the Order in the Gazette is not a

pre-condition for the Order to become operational. In fact, the requirement is

that the Order shall be published in the Gazette as soon as convenient. 6 The Gazette Notification pertaining to X15 has been annexed to the amended petition filed by the Petitioner.

18

Therefore, this Court takes the view that the failure to publish the Order in the

Gazette, on 23rd August 2014 does not affect the legal validity of the Order.

This Court is therefore of the view that the imposition of the Levy at the rate of

Rs. 40 per kg of Potatoes has been done in terms of the Order marked X15

issued by the Minister of Finance, and hence, this Court does not see any merit

in the second argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

The necessity for this Court to consider the prayer for the Writ of Mandamus

therefore does not arise.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any merit in the

application of the Petitioner. The application of the Petitioner is accordingly

dismissed, without costs.
