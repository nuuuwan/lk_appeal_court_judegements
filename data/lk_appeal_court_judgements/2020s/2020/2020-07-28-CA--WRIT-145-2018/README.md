Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner has filed this application mainly against the 3rd

Respondent, the Director of Bank Supervision of the Central

Bank, seeking to quash by certiorari the decisions or

determinations contained in P10 dated 11.12.2017 and P12

dated 19.02.2018, insofar as they relate to the Petitioners

entitlement to accumulated distribution rights, i.e., cash

dividends and scrip dividends, in respect of the unregistered

shares held by the Petitioner in the 4th Respondent licensed

commercial bank, Hatton National Bank PLC.

There is no dispute that, in order to ensure the soundness of the

banking system, the 1st Respondent, the Monetary Board of the

Central Bank, in terms of section 46(1) of the Banking Act, No.

30 of 1988, as amended, issued Directions No.1 of 2007

(hereinafter referred to as the Directions) marked P3 dated

19.01.2007 to licensed commercial banks regarding ownership

of issued capital carrying voting rights.

Accordingly, under clause 3 of the Directions marked P3, which

is in line with section 12(1C)(a) of the Banking Act, an

individual, partnership or corporate body shall not directly or

indirectly or through a nominee or acting in concert with any

other individual, partnership or corporate body, acquire a

material interest in a licensed commercial bank without the

prior written approval of the 1st Respondent given with the

concurrence of the subject Minister.

A material interest is defined, both in P3 and in the Banking

Amendment Act, No.2 of 2005, as the holding of over 10% of the

5

issued capital of a licensed commercial bank carrying voting

rights.

The term acting in concert is defined in section 12(1C)(a) of the

said amending Act, No.2 of 2005, as follows:

acting in concert means acting pursuant to an

understanding (whether formal or informal) to actively co-

operate in acquiring a material interest in a licensed

commercial bank so as to obtain or consolidate, control of

that bank.

In terms of clause 4 of P3, subject to conditions, the 1st

Respondent can grant permission to some categories of

shareholders to acquire a material interest up to 15%.

Clause 6 of P3 contains the following:

6(1) Any material interest previously acquired by any of the

categories of shareholders referred to in sections 12(1C)

and 46(1)(d) in excess of 15 per cent of the issued capital

carrying voting rights in a licensed commercial bank and

held at the date of these Directions, shall be disposed of

and/or otherwise reduced by such shareholders to a level

not exceeding 15 per cent of the issued capital carrying

voting rights in the licensed commercial bank.

(2) Such disposal and/or reduction shall be carried out

within the period as may be specified by the Monetary

Board on a case by case basis, provided that such period

shall not exceed five years from the date of stipulation.

6

(3) In the event, any of the categories of shareholders

referred to in section 12(1C) and 46(1)(d) fails to comply

with the directives of the Monetary Board within the

stipulated period of time, the voting rights in excess of 10

per cent attributable to the ownership of shares held by the

categories of shareholders subject to this Direction shall be

deemed invalid with effect from the last date of the period

specified by the Monetary Board to reduce the material

interest.

The Petitioner draws a distinction between clause 3 and 6 to say

the former is applicable to new shareholdings acquired after the

amending Act, No.2 of 2005, and the latter to existing

shareholdings at the time of P3 coming into effect; and further

says the Petitioner falls into the latter category, as it held 6.45%

of the issued share capital carrying voting rights of the 4th

Respondent at the time. However, there is no necessity to dwell

on this point, as the said distinction is not relevant or material

to the facts of the instant case, as I will explain in the course of

this Judgment.

Pursuant to P3, the 1st Respondent informed licensed

commercial banks to disclose all categories of shareholders who

have a material interest greater than 15% of the issued share

capital carrying voting rights of each bank.

In response, the 4th Respondent, by 3R2, disclosed inter alia the

Stassen Group as a shareholder holding 24.39% of the issued

share capital carrying voting rights of the 4th Respondent.

7

The 4th Respondent did not disclose that the Petitioner and a

company by the name of CBD Exports Limited are part of the

Stassen Group.

However, upon an investigation carried out by the Bank

Supervision Department of the Central Bank, it was established

that the Petitioner and the said CBD Exports Limited are part of

the Stassen Group, and they each held 6.45% and 8.11% of the

issued share capital carrying voting rights of the 4th Respondent,

in violation of the Directions marked P3.1 This finding of the 3rd

Respondent is not directly challenged by the Petitioner.

As a result, the 3rd Respondent, by P4 dated 26.08.2010,

informed the 4th Respondent to implement the (following)

Direction of the Monetary Board.

(a) HNB (the 4th Respondent) to aggregate the shareholding

of 14.56% of CBD and PAL (the Petitioner) in HNB with

that of the Stassen Group with immediate effect for the

purpose of the Direction No.1 of 2007 dated 19.01.2007

issued by the Monetary Board (P3).

(b) CBD and PAL to dispose of the shareholding of 14.56%

in HNB within six months from 19.08.2010.

(c) HNB to remove the names of CBD and PAL from the

register of members of the bank with immediate effect as

required in terms of section 12(1C)(c) of the Banking Act.

1 Vide P5, 3R17, 3R19(a), P4/3R5, Paragraph 23 (viii) of the statement of objections of the 1st-3rd Respondents and paragraph 25(viii) of the corresponding affidavit of the 3rd Respondent.

8

The above was conveyed to the Petitioner by the 4th Respondent

by P4 dated 26.08.2010.

As seen from 3R8, the 4th Respondent immediately complied

with (a) and (c) above, i.e., the 4th Respondent aggregated the

shareholding of the Petitioner with that of the Stassen Group

and removed the name of the Petitioner from the Register of

Shareholders of the 4th Respondent bank.

3R9 dated 15.02.2011 reveals that the Petitioner requested an

extension of time from the 2nd Respondent to sell its (the

Petitioners) shares in the 4th Respondent for a better price.

By 3R10 dated 16.03.2011, the Petitioner again requested

additional time to sell its shares. This request was turned down

by the 3rd Respondent, who informed the Petitioner the direction

of the Monetary Board has to be complied with immediately and

such request is not warranted. The Petitioner was further

informed HNB has already removed the name of PAL (the

Petitioner) from its members register.

By 3R11 dated 21.04.2011, the 4th Respondent informed the

Petitioner to take immediate measures to divest its

shareholding in the 4th Respondent, as non-compliance with the

Directions of the Monetary Board is an offence under section 79

of the Banking Act.

This was repeated by the 3rd Respondent inter alia by 3R13

dated 13.06.2011, whereby the Petitioner was directed to take

steps to dispose of the shares of HNB held by PHL with

immediate effect.

9

Despite repeated demands, the Petitioner kept on postponing the

divestiture of its shares in the 4th Respondent, finally disposing

of the same only in or around March 2018 whereas the shares

should have been disposed of on or before 19.02.2011.

During the period of its shares being unregistered, the dividends

due to the Petitioner were not paid by the 4th Respondent, and

the Petitioner repeatedly demanded the payment. One such

demand is P8(a) dated 19.05.2017, which was answered by the

4th Respondent by P8(b) dated 25.05.2017 wherein the 4th

Respondent inter alia informs the Petitioner:

Please note that since Panchalingam Associates (Pvt) Ltd

(PAL) is not registered in the Banks Shareholders Register,

we are not in a position to accede to your request.

According to our records, by its letter dated 13th June 2011,

Central Bank of Sri Lanka has given a direction requiring

PAL to take steps to dispose of the shares of HNB held by

PAL with immediate effect and up to date PAL has not

complied with this direction. Therefore, you are in

continuous violation of a direction given by the Central

Bank of Sri Lanka and in terms of section 79 of the Banking

Act this is a punishable offence.

Thereafter, the Petitioner wrote several letters to the 3rd

Respondent, complaining against the actions of the 4th

Respondent in this regard2 and requesting the 3rd Respondent to

intervene in order to direct Hatton National Bank PLC to

2 Vide P9(a) dated 06.10.2017, P9(b) dated 20.10.2017, P9(c) dated 16.11.2017.

10

immediately cease its unreasonable, arbitrary and unfair conduct

and to direct them to pay our company its lawful dividend

entitlement from the date of the purported un-registration of our

shares along with other distribution rights enjoyed by the

shareholders of Hatton National Bank during the subject period.3

The 3rd Respondent replied these letters by P10 dated

11.12.2017, wherein the 3rd Respondent inter alia informed the

Petitioner HNB has removed the name of PAL (the Petitioner)

from the register of members of the bank to comply with the above

direction. Since unregistered shares do not have rights to

dividends, HNB has not paid any dividends to PAL since that

date. P12 dated 19.02.2018 is a reiteration of the same.

The substantive relief sought by the Petitioner in this application

is to quash by certiorari the decisions or determinations in the

aforementioned P10 and P12 relating to the entitlement of the

Petitioner to accumulated distribution rights. What the Petitioner

essentially seeks thereby is recognition of its entitlement to the

dividends (cash and scrip) that accumulated during the period

its shares in the 4th Respondent Bank were unregistered.

Is this permissible? Or, is the abovementioned position taken up

by the 4th Respondent and confirmed by the 3rd Respondent

legally correct? Let me now consider this.

It is undisputed that the name of the Petitioner was removed

from the Share Register of the 4th Respondent around August

3 Vide P9(a).

11

2010.4 What flows from such a removal? The Companies Act,

No.7 of 2007, provides the answer.

Section 130 of the Companies Act enacts:

130(1) The entry of the name of a person in the share

register as holder of a share shall be prima facie evidence

that title to the share is vested in that person.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of

section 86, a company may treat the registered holder of a

share as the only person entitled to

(a) exercise the right to vote attaching to the share;

(b) receive notices;

(c) receive a distribution in respect of the share; and

(d) exercise any other rights and powers attaching to

the share. (emphasis added)

Section 86 of the Companies Act reads:

(1) In this Act, the term shareholder means

(a) a person whose name is entered in the share

register as the holder for the time being of one or

more shares in the company;

(b) until a persons name is entered in the share

register, a person named as a shareholder in an

4 Vide 3R8.

12

application for incorporation of a company at the

time of registration of the company;

(c) until a persons name is entered in the share

register, a person who is entitled to have that

persons name entered in the share register under

a registered amalgamation proposal as a

shareholder in an amalgamated company;

(d) until a persons name is entered in the share

register, a person to whom a share has been

transferred and whose name ought to be but has

not been entered in the register.

(2) Where a notice of any trust has been entered in the

share register in respect of any shares in a company under

subsection (2) of section 129, the person for whose benefit

those shares are held in trust

(a) shall be deemed to be a shareholder in the

company; and

(b) shall in respect of those shares, enjoy all such

rights and privileges and be subject to all such

duties and obligations under this Act, as if his

name had been entered in the share register as

the holder of those shares.

(3) Where a company has wrongfully failed to enter in the

share register the name of a person to whom shares have

been transferred, that person

13

(a) shall be deemed to be a shareholder in the

company; and

(b) shall in respect of those shares, enjoy all such

rights and privileges and be subject to all such

duties and obligations under this Act, as if his

name had been entered in the share register as

the holder of those shares. (emphasis added)

Let me also quote section 129 of the Companies Act (referred to

in section 86(2) above) for completeness.

129(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2), no notice

of any trust, expressed, implied or constructive, shall be

entered on the share register or be receivable by the

Registrar in the case of companies registered in Sri Lanka.

(2) A company shall enter in its register and the Registrar

shall receive notice of any trust, the trustee of which is a

company and-

(a) the principal business of which is to act as a

central depository to a stock exchange licensed

under the Securities and Exchange Commission of

Sri Lanka Act, No. 36 of 1987; and

(b) which has been approved by the Minister in

consultation with the Securities and Exchange

Commission of Sri Lanka, established by that Act.

The following is deducible from the above:

14

(a) The Petitioner, whose name was removed from the

Share Register, cannot, in a strict technical sense, be

regarded as a shareholder. (subsection (1) of section

86)

(b) The Petitioner does not fall into the two specific

exceptions contained in sections 86(2) and (3) to be

treated as a shareholder whose name is not included in

the Share Register.

(c) The Petitioner is therefore not entitled to dividends as

of right. (sub section (2) of section 130)

Accordingly, the refusal to pay dividends for the unregistered

shares of the Petitioner by the 4th Respondent and the

confirmation of the same by the 3rd Respondent are flawless.

Having said so, let me also add the following.

The shares of the Petitioner in the 4th Respondent were

unregistered by the 4th Respondent not of its own volition, but

pursuant to a ruling by the Monetary Board upon the violation

of the Directions marked P3. The Monetary Board took the view

the 4th Respondent HNB has failed and/or willfully defaulted in

providing the CBSL with accurate details pertaining to the

relationship between and among CBD, PAL and Stassen Group

upon the request of the Director of Bank Supervision5 and

therefore approved Reprimanding the Chief Executive

Officer/Managing Director and the Company Secretary of HNB for

violation of the Direction No.1 of 2007 by providing incorrect

5 Vide 3R19(a). Vide also 3R5, 3R15, 3R17.

15

information.6 It is thereafter the 4th Respondent surrendered

and complied with the Directions in this regard, which included

unregistering the Petitioners shares forthwith.

For the aforesaid reasons, the Petitioners application is bound

to fail.

However, the Petitioner does not stop here. The Petitioner

indirectly seeks to attack the decision of the 1st Respondent

Monetary Board contained in 3R19(b) dated 19.08.2010,

whereby the Petitioner was directed to dispose of its

shareholding in the 4th Respondent within six months of the

date of the Directions, which was communicated, as I have

already explained, both to the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent

by the 3rd Respondent.

The Petitioner, having accepted the said decision of the 1st

Respondent Monetary Board at that time, cannot, in my view,

after a lapse of eight years, challenge the same by way of a writ

application.

The Petitioner says it is trite law that estoppel does not and

cannot be invoked in the face of a statute, for against a statute no

estoppel can prevail. I agree. But there is no violation of a

statute on the part of the 1st or 3rd Respondents for this

principle to be applied in favour of the Petitioner.

I must also emphasise, in the same breath, writ being a

discretionary remedy, the Court is not bound by the rigidity of

the law as in the case of an appeal, which the appellant is

6 Vide 3R19(b).

16

entitled to invoke as of right whereas the applicant in a writ

application has no such legal right in that notwithstanding he

may be entitled in law to the relief he seeks, the Court can still

refuse the relief on various considerations.

The Petitioner submits The 1st to 3rd Respondents have inter alia

acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in directing the Petitioner to

dispose of its shares whilst allowing other parties to reduce their

shareholding by way of P4 which amounts to unequal treatment

before the law. Even assuming the Petitioner is correct, the

Petitioner knew about P4 and about the alleged unequal

treatment in or around August 2010. Unequal treatment before

the law is a violation of the fundamental right guaranteed by

Article 12 of the Constitution. Without having filed a

fundamental rights application at that time, the Petitioner

cannot, eight years later, agitate the same matter by way of a

writ application.

Although the Petitioner filed this application seeking to quash by

certiorari the decisions or determinations of the 3rd Respondent

contained in P10 and P12 regarding payment of dividends, this

relief, in my view, is misconceived in law.

If I may explain, there is no decision or determination in P10

and P12 made by the 3rd Respondent in respect of dividends.

The decision to remove the Petitioner from the Share Register of

the 4th Respondent and to direct the Petitioner to dispose of its

shares within six months of the Directions marked P3 was taken

by the 1st Respondent Monetary Board, not by the 3rd

Respondent. Upon the said decision of the Monetary Board, the

17

3rd Respondent expressed the opinion unregistered shares do

not have rights to dividends, HNB has not paid any dividends to

PAL since that date. This is not a decision amenable to writ

jurisdiction. The decision of the Monetary Board is not

challenged in this application. Without challenging the main

decision, the Petitioner cannot challenge the consequences of

the decision although vice versa is possible, in that, once the

main decision is declared a nullity all that flows from it becomes

a nullity it does not happen in the reverse, as the Petitioner

attempted to suggest at the argument.

Although there is no necessity to go further, let me now briefly

consider the basis on which the Petitioner says the Monetary

Board could not have compelled the unregistering of the

Petitioners shares in the 4th Respondent bank.

The Petitioner, whilst stating it held over 6% of shares in the 4th

Respondent well before the Directions marked P3 was issued,

further submits:

In terms of section 6 of Direction No.1 of 2007 of the

Monetary Board (P3), which is clearly applicable to existing

shares, if at all only the voting rights of the shares of the

Petitioner could have been limited/curtailed and not

otherwise. There is no right or power given under the said

section 6 to unregister shares or to deny distribution rights

in respect of shares which were already held by persons at

the time of coming into operation of Direction No.1 of 2007.

18

Although there is no power to unregister shares under clause 6

of P3, such power is given to the Monetary Board by clause 8,

which reads as follows:

In terms of section 12(1C)(c) (of the Banking Act) and subject

to Directions 6 and 7 above, a licensed commercial bank

shall not enter in its register of members the name of any

shareholder referred to in sections 12(1C) and 46(1)(d) as

the holder of shares of the bank, who or which has

contravened the provisions of section 12(1C) and/or these

Directions. (emphasis added)

I cannot agree with the argument of the Petitioner that the said

provisions apply only prospectively and do not and could not have

affected the shareholders and shareholdings that existed at the

time of the amending enactment in 2005.

At this juncture, I must also make reference to the Wrongdoer

Principle, which seems to be the further development of the

Roman-Dutch Law principle spoliatus ante debet omnia

restituendus est.7 The Wrongdoer Principle demands A

wrongdoer shall not be allowed to benefit out of his own

wrongdoing. Vide Seelawathie Mallawa v. Millie Keerthiratne,8

Subramanium v. Shabdeen,9 and Kariyawasam v. Sujatha

Janaki.10 Ex turpi causa non oritur actio is another legal doctrine

worth mentioning at this stage, according to which a party

7 This means the party dispossessed ought first of all to be restored. Vide Enso Nona v. Somawathie [1998] 3 Sri LR 239 at 244. 8 [1982] 1 Sri LR 384. 9 [1984] 1 Sri LR 48 at 56. 10 [2013] BLR 77.

19

cannot be permitted to pursue a legal remedy if it springs from his

own illegal act.

In the instant matter, what did the Petitioner do? The Petitioner

did not dispose of its shares in the 4th Respondent bank for

seven long years, despite its name being removed from the Share

Register and despite the 3rd Respondent as well as the 4th

Respondent repeatedly insisting that the unregistered shares be

disposed of immediately. Instead, the Petitioner kept on violating

the Monetary Board Directions marked P3, thereby perpetrating

a punishable offence under section 79 of the Banking Act. CBD

Exports Limited, which was also identified as a violator along

with the Petitioner, complied with the Directions immediately

and sold its shares.11 The Monetary Board could not strike off or

cancel the shares of the Petitioner. All it could do was direct the

4th Respondent to remove the Petitioner from the Share Register

of the 4th Respondent until the unregistered shares of the

Petitioner were disposed of, which the Petitioner was required to

do as soon as possible. The result of the unregistering was to

prevent the Petitioner from benefiting from the said shares in

any manner other than by sale of the shares. The Petitioner is

now asking this Court to allow it to benefit from its wrongdoing,

stating that from August 2010 until the unregistered shares

were sold in March 2018, the shares formed part of the total

capital of the 4th Respondent, thereby accruing dividends, and

the Petitioner as the owner of the shares is solely entitled to the

said dividends. The writ Court exercising discretionary and

equitable jurisdiction will not be a party to such a transaction.

11 Vide 3R9.

20

The Petitioners repeated assertions before this Court that in

December 2017 (by P10) the 3rd Respondent approved and

permitted the sale of the purported unregistered shares held by

the Petitioner in the 4th Respondent bank and consequent to the

decision/permission/approval of the 3rd Respondent dated 11th

December 2017 (P10) the Petitioner disposed of its subject shares

held in the 4th Respondent company are manifestly misleading.

From August 2010, the 3rd Respondent insisted that the

Petitioner sell its shares forthwith. In P10, the 3rd Respondent

made it abundantly clear there is no requirement to seek CBSL

approval to dispose of the said shares which have been long

overdue. It appears the Petitioner purportedly sought

approval to sell its shares from the 3rd Respondent in

November 2017 by P9(c) in order to lay the foundation for this

application.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with costs.
