Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner was at all times material to this application the Chairman of the Dimbulagala

Pradeshiya Sabha. By letter dated 21.02.2014 (P10) the Chief Minister of the North Central

Province called for explanations from the Petitioner on two specific charges. Thereafter by

letter dated 26.05.2014 (P12) the Chief Minister appointed the 2nd Respondent as the inquiring

officer in terms of section 185(2) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987 (Pradeshiya Sabha

Act) to inquire and report on the said charges.

It appears that after inquiry the 2nd Respondent submitted his report P17 to the 1st Respondent

who was by then the Chief Minister. The 1st Respondent thereafter issued a notification in

terms of section 185 of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act removing the Petitioner from the post of

Chairman of the Dimbulagala Pradeshiya Sabha (P16).

The Petitioner is seeking a writ of certiorari quashing the said order dated 18.02.2015 (P16) made

by the 1st Respondent.

A preliminary objection was raised by the 1st, 3rd and the 5th to 6th Respondents that necessary

parties have not been made Respondents. It is claimed that the members of the Dimbulagala

Pradeshiya Sabha should have been made Respondents as the charges against the Petitioner

stems from the failure on the part of the Petitioner to tender an amended budget to the

Pradeshiya Sabha.

However, as pointed out by the Petitioner th is objection was raised before a different bench on

12.02.2019 and was overruled.

The main contention of the Petitioner is that the 2nd Respondent conducted the inquiry in breach

of the rules of natural justice and considered irrelevant matters and not the two charges set out

in the show cause letter (P10).

The rules of natural justice are not engraved in stone. The exact scope of the requirements of

fairness depends on the circumstances of each case such as the character of the decision-making

body, the types of decisions to be made and the statutory framework which guides the decision-

making body.

As Tucker U expounded in Russell v. Duke of Norfolk [(1949) 1 All E.R. 109 at 117J:

"There are, in my view, no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry

and kind of domestic tribunal. The requirements of natural justice must depend on the

circumstances of the cose, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is

acting, the subject-matter that is being dealt with, and so forth. Accordingly, I do not

derive much assistance from the definitions of natural justice which have been fram time

to time used, but, whatever standard is adopted, one essential is that the person

concerned should have a reasonable opportunity to present his case."

The 2nd Respondent was appointed in terms of section 185 (2) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act which

requires the Minister to appoint a retired judicial officer to inquire into and report to him on

whether any of the matters referred to in section 185(1) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act has been

committed by any member of a Pradeshiya Sabha.

Such an inquiry has the potential to affect the membership of a person in a Pradeshiya Sabha and

as such must provide him with a fair hearing. A fair hearing in this instance necessarily requires

inter alia the person being given an opportunity to know the charges against him, an opportunity

of summoning any witnesses to meet the case against him as well the opportunity to cross-

examine the witnesses testifying against him. It must be borne in mind that such a person is

elected by the people and his removal must be according to the rule of law.

The Petitioner was not given an opportunity of cross-examining the persons who testified against

him nor was he given an opportunity of being present during their testimony.

There is a more fundamental error of law in the conduct of the inquiry by the 2nd Respondent.

He was appointed to inquire into and report on the charges made against the Petitioner by the

Chief Minister as set out in letter dated 21.02.2014 (PlO). However, he has gone on a voyage of

discovery and allowed fresh complaints and not considered the two charges and has thereby

acted ultra vires. It has also resulted in the Petitioner being deprived of knowing the charges

against him.

In the order dated 18.02.2015 (P1G), the 1" Respondent states that he has considered the report

of the 2nd Respondent P17 in making the said order. Thereby he has fallen into error by breaching

the rules of natural justice and acting illegally.

The 1" , 3rd and the 5th to Gth Respondents have raised an objection that the application is futile

since the Petitioner has not sought a quashing of the report of the 2nd Respondent P17. The

decision affecting the rights of the Petitioner were made by order dated 18.02.2015 (P1G). It is

sufficient for the Petitioner to have sought only a quashing of order dated 18.02.2015 (P16).

For all the foregoing reasons, I issue a writ of certiorari quashing the order dated 18,02,2015

(P16) made by the 1st Respondent,

The Petitioner is entitled to the costs of this application from the 1st Respondent,
