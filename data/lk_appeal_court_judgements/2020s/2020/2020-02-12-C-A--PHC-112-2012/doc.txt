This is an appeal against the order of the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the Western

Province holden in Kaluthara dated 26.07.2012.

The question before Court is whether the Magistrate's Court has jurisdiction in terms of the

Maintenance Act No. 37 of 1999 (Act) to enforce an order for alimony made by the District Court.

The Respondent-Respondent-Appellant (Appellant) and the Applicant-Petitioner-Respondent

(Respondent) got married on 24.10.1996 and have one son. The Respondent instituted action

against the Appellant in the District Court of Mathugama in case no. 2881 seeking a divorce on

the ground of malicious desertion and on 02.11.2006 judgment was entered in favour of the

Respondent who was also granted Rs. 300,000/= as permanent alimony.

The Appellant failed to pay the permanent alimony and the Respondent instituted action in M.e.

Mathugama in terms of the Act to recover the sum of Rs. 300,000/= which was disallowed. The

Respondent moved in revision to the Provincial High Court Judge of the Western Province holden

in Kaluthara which allowed the application. Hence this appeal.

The learned High Court Judge held that the Magistrate's Court has jurisdiction to recover any

alimony ordered by the District Court in terms of section 624A of the Civil Procedure Code which

reads:

"An order for alimony or maintenance made under this chapter may be enforced either

in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance or in the manner provided in the

Maintenance Ordinance."

The parties are not at variance on whether an order for alimony or maintenance made under

chapter XLII of the Civil Procedure Code can be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the

Civil Procedure Code. The issue is whether such an order can be enforced by the Magistrate's

Court in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

The Maintenance Ordinance was repealed by section 19 of the Act. Where in any written law or

document reference is made to any written law which is subsequently repealed, such reference

shall be deemed to be made to the written law by which the repeal is effected or to the

corresponding portion thereof [Section 16(1) of the Interpretation Ordinance). This section

applies to written laws and documents made before as well as after the commencement of the

Interpretation Ordinance [Section 16(2) of the Interpretation Ordinance).

Therefore, section 624A of the Civil Procedure Code can be read to include a reference to the Act.

Yet the question is whether the Act vests the Magistrate's Court with jurisdiction to enforce an

order for alimony made by the District Court.

Part I of the Act deals with who can make an application for maintenance and the grounds on

which it can be allowed. Part II deals with the enforcement of orders for maintenance. Section

5(1) refers to enforcement of orders but is limited to any person against whom an order is made

under section 2 or the proviso to section 11 (1) of the Act. It does not include the enforcement of

an order for alimony or maintenance made under chapter XLII of the Civil Procedure Code.

Accordingly, I hold that the Magistrate's Court does not have jurisdiction to enforce an order for

alimony or maintenance made under chapter XLII of the Civil Procedure Code.

For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the order of the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the

Western Province holden in Kaluthara dated 26.07.2012. The parties shall bear their costs.
