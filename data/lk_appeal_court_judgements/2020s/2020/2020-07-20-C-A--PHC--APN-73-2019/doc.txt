*************

ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

The Accused-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner)

invokes the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court in seeking to set aside an

order made by the High Court of Gampaha on 16.01.2018 by which he was

remanded by cancelling the existing bail order in case No. HC 109/14. The

other order sought to be impugned by the Petitioner is the order of the

said High Court dated 08.05.2019, by which it had refused his subsequent

application for bail.

In stating the circumstances under which the said impugned orders

were made, the Petitioner states that he was arrested in connection with a

murder and after about two years was bailed out on 13.05.2010 upon the

order made by the High Court of Gampaha in application No. HCBA

2

266/2009. He was indicted for that offence in case No. 29/2016 before the

same Court.

On 09.04.2013 he was arrested by officers attached to Police

Narcotics Bureau and was produced before the Magistrate's Court of

Attanagalla in case No. B 693/13, by introducing Heroin. He was enlarged

on bail by the High Court in application No. HCBA 219/13 by its order

dated 05.05.2014. He was indicted for possession of Heroin in case No.

110/14 before the same Court.

The Petitioner was arrested by the PNB officers in May 2016, as he

claims, again after introducing Heroin. He was enlarged on bail by the

High Court in application No. HCBA 137/16 by order dated 24.10.2016,

"even before the receipt of Government Analyst report".

Thereafter, the Petitioner was arrested by the PNB officers for the

third time with three others on 14.10.2017 and produced before the

Magistrate's Court of Attanagalla in case No. 2598/17. The Petitioner was

enlarged on bail by the High Court of Gampaha in application No. HCBA

67/2019 on 01.04.2019.

In paragraph 8 of his petition addressed to this Court, the Petitioner

states that;

he could not appear before High Court of Gampaha on

16.11.2017 as he was in remand custody under B 2598/17 and was

not produced to Court by the Prison officers on that day, and he

was produced to High Court for HC 109/14 on 16.01.2018 by the

Prison officers on that day the learned High Court Judge cancelled

his bail, without hearing him personally or his lawyer, citing the

3

reason that he might involve in other crimes if he was released on

bail. "

He then identifies several" exceptional" grounds in paragraph 12 of

his petition, inviting this Court to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction in

consideration of them. These grounds include the failure of the High Court

to note that there was no condition to re-offend, no evidence of him posing

a flight risk, he has right to bail and no previous convictions, the Court had

acted in violation of its own previous order, results in indefinite

incarceration, is violative of presumption of innocence and of his rights

under ICCPR Act No. 56 of 2007 and set up a wrong judicial precedent.

At the hearing of this application, learned Counsel for the Petitioner

submitted that the High Court made order cancelling his existing bail order

without giving him a hearing. Therefore, learned Counsel contends that the

said Court had come to the conclusion without any evidence or

information that there is a greater possibility that he might evade

appearing before Court. He relied on the judgment of this Court in CA

(PHC) Application No. 58/2013 - decided on 03.09.2013 where it was

reiterated that" ... the Court is entitled to cancel a bail bond (after hearing the

accused) for violating the bail conditions ... " and in this instance there was no

opportunity afforded to the Petitioner to offer his explanation. He also

referred to the original order by which the Petitioner was enlarged on bail,

which had no condition imposed on the Petitioner not to re-offend. Thus, it

was contended that the impugned order of cancellation of bail was made

contrary to law and the subsequent order of the said Court in refusing bail,

too is dependent on the legality of the order of cancellation.

4

Learned State Counsel, in her objections listed out following, as

pending cases against the Petitioner;

a. HC 140/19 of High Court Gampaha for possession and trafficking

of 20 grams of Heroin on 27.05.2016,

b. HC 183/190f High Court Gampaha for possession and trafficking

of 6 grams of Heroin on 16.10.2017,

c. HC 110/140f High Court Gampaha for possession of an automatic

weapon and live cartridges on 09.04.2013,

d. HC 109/140f High Court Gampaha for possession and trafficking

of 11.25 grams of Heroin on 09.04.2013.

In resisting the Petitioner's application for revision, learned State

Counsel submitted that there are no exceptional circumstances upon which

this Court could grant him relief.

The indictment against the Petitioner in High Court Gampaha case

No. 109/14 alleged that he possessed and trafficked 11.25 grams of Heroin,

offences under Section 54A(b) and (c) of the Poisons Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended. The applicable provision on bail

is found at Section 83(1) where it is stated that accused should be enlarged

on bail only in exceptional circumstances.

It is evident from the certified proceedings of the said case; the

Petitioner was enlarged on bail by the High Court on 07.10. 2014 after

serving indictment, upon the same conditions that were imposed by that

Court on 05.05.2014.

The 1st impugned order dated 16.01.2018 was made when the

Petitioner was represented by his Counsel on a trial date and the High

5

Court, having noted that the trial could not proceed since the Petitioner

was rearrested and remanded on an allegation of committing a similar

offence, cancelled his bail on the footing that the Petitioner would reoffend

and poses high degree of flight risk. The Petitioner claims that there was no

evidence before the High Court of him posing a flight risk. But the

proceedings of HC 29/16 on 11.01.2018 indicate that he was arrested on a

warrant issued by that Court due to his unexplained absence in Court and

his sureties have withdrawn from their suretyships. Learned High Court

Judge who presided over on 11.01.2018 is the same Judge who made the 1st

impugned order on 16.01.2018 after a lapse of mere 5 days since his

previous order. Clearly the Petitioner's claim there was no evidence as to

the flight risk, put at its lowest, is an obvious misstatement. The question

of a flight risk, a legitimate concern to the High Court should be taken into

account in considering bail.

The 2nd impugned order dated 08.05.2019 is an order by which the

High Court had refused the Petitioner's application to enlarge him on bail

applying similar considerations as it did on 16.01.2018. This particular

order is a common order made in relation to bail applications made to the

High Court in Case Nos. 29/2016, 109/2014 and 110/2014. The Court

considered that case No. 29/2016, the Petitioner was accused of committing

murder, while case Nos. 109 and 110/14 were in relation to possession of

Heroin and also of an automatic weapon with live ammunition

respectively.

The alleged murder was committed in 2008 whereas the detection in

relation to possession of Heroin and firearm was made in 2013, whilst he

was on bail. When the Court made the said 2nd order, the Petitioner was

6

accused of yet another instance of possessing Heroin, where he was

indicted in Case No. HC 67/19.

It was urged on behalf of the Petitioner that he was remanded for a

long period of time and was enlarged on bail in relation to one of his

already pending cases.

The main thrust of the Petitioner's contention on the order dated

16.01.2018 was the High Court failed to show cause him as to why his bail

bond should not be cancelled.

Upon perusal of the said impugned order, it is evident that the

Petitioner was not present on a trial date and his Counsel informed Court

that he was remanded in relation to a subsequent allegation. It would have

been clearer if the High Court, in cancelling the existing bail order, referred

at least to the gist of the submissions of the Counsel for the Petitioner,

before making the said order. However, the short Court order contains

material that were placed before it by the Petitioner and it's reasons for

cancelling the existing bail order.

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner invited to pronounce that this

Court emphasises that the High Courts, in such circumstances, be guided

by the provisions of Section 14 of the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997, where it was

made mandatory for the Court to have an application to cancel existing bail

order by a "Police officer" and to hear the accused through his pleader,

before it proceeded to cancel an existing bail order. He admits, however,

that the provisions of the Bail Act have no application to the instant matter.

When the High Court made the 1st impugned order on 16.01.2016, in

Case No. 109/14 against the Petitioner was fixed for trial and it could not

7

be taken up for trial as scheduled due to absence of the Petitioner, who was

remanded by a different Court.

In this situation, the applicable provisions are contained in Section

263(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 as amended by

Act No. 14 of 2005. Applicable parts of the said sub section are to the effect

that whenever it becomes necessary or advisable to postpone the

commencement of trial, the Court may remand the accused if in custody or

may commit him to custody or take bail in his own recognizance.

In this instance, the Petitioner's alleged conduct resulted in the

postponement of the commencement of his trial before the High Court and

he was accused committing a similar offence on 27.05.2016, whilst being on

bail for several cases that are pending before the same Court. It is his

contention that Heroin was introduced on him by overzealous officers of

the PNB due to their personal animosity towards him. However, this Court

nor the High Court cannot decide the Petitioner's claim for it is the trial

Court that had been empowered to decide such disputed questions of fact,

upon hearing evidence.

When the Counsel for the Petitioner informed Court that he was

accused of similar offence, it is reasonable for that Court to infer that the

Petitioner poses a greater flight risk with another case is pending, in

addition to the one he already has, both of which carried sentence of death

or life imprisonment, if found guilty.

It appears that the Petitioner was content with merely informing

Court that he was framed by the PNB officers through his Counsel when

making application for bail. There is no material even to suggest that he

8

had complained the atrocious conduct of the PNB officers in foisting these

very serious allegations on him due to their personal animosity to any

authority, which is the reasonable conduct expected of such a person.

The Petitioner also stated in his petition that" ... learned High Court

Judge failed to observe that the Petitioner appeared in Court in all the dates

in this Case except when he was remanded ... "and described the said

ground as an exceptional ground.

In stating this particular ground as exceptional, the Petitioner

qualifies himself to his declaration to "this case". There is a valid reason for

this selective assertion. This is due to the fact that in Case No. HC 29/16,

the Petitioner did not appear before the High Court on a trial date and was

produced before that Court on 11.01.2018, being arrested upon execution of

a warrant of arrest. On that day, his sureties sought to withdraw from their

suretyships and the Court made order remanding the Petitioner. This is a

clear attempt to mislead this Court by the Petitioner and in the light of the

misstatement referred to above, this Court is convinced that the Petitioner

did not come to this Court with clean hands. The relief he seeks being a

discretionary remedy, his conduct is very material in determining this

application.

In relation to the 2nd impugned order, the Petitioner has clearly failed

to establish before the High Court that there were exceptional

circumstances. When three of his applications for bail is taken up, it is not

clear whether the Petitioner had addressed the Court on two different legal

regimes that are applicable to these applications. In relation to the

allegation of murder, it is the provisions of Bail Act that are applicable

9

while in relation to other two allegations of possession of Heroin it is the

provisions of Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance are

applicable.

In view of the above considerations, this Court finds no illegality or

irregularity in the impugned orders made by the High Court. Since the

Petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court that the grounds that were

described by him are exceptional in order to exercise its revisionary

powers. Considered in the light of his contumacious conduct, he is not

entitled to any relief. His application is accordingly refused.

In these circumstances, his petition is dismissed without costs.
