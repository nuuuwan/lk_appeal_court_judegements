Decided on 25.0S.2020

A.H.M.D. Nawaz, J. (P/CA) I

n a conspectus, the issue that arises in this application for judicial review is whether a

Magistrate has the power to issue a warrant of arrest even in cases where the Police

can make an arrest without a warrant.

All the Petitioners in the Writ Applications (CA/Writ/216/2020, CA/Writ/217/2020,

CA/Writ/21S/2020, CA/Writ/221/2020 and CAIWrit/222/2020) seek in the main a writ

of certiorari that would quash the orders made by the learned Magistrate, Kurunegala in

the Case bearing No. B/2427/2020 issuing and reissuing a warrant of arrest against them

on 07.0S.2020 and 10.0S.2020. An interim order until the final determination of the

application staying the action of the aforesaid order is also sought in the applications.

When these applications came up for support on 12.0S.2020, consensually only the

application CA/Writ/21S/2020 was taken up as this was one of the cases that had the

complete set of papers relating to the proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Kurunegala

in the aforesaid Case B/2427/2020. Mr. Riad Ameen, the learned Counsel who appeared

for the Petitioner in CAIWrit/21S/2020, tendered to both this Court and Mr. Sarath

Jayamanne, PC, Senior Additional Solicitor General (SASG) certified copies of

proceedings obtained from the Magistrate's Court and thereafter proceeded to support

this application, in the course of which both Mr. Riad Ameen and Mr. Sarath Jayamanne

made extensive submissions for and against the grant of Notice and Interim Orders. The

respective counsel in the other applications, Mr. Rienzi Arsecularatne, PC in CA Writ

221/2020, Mr. Kalinga Indatissa, PC in CA Writ 217/2020 and Mr. Shavindra Fernando,

PC in CA Writ 216/2020 all in unison associated themselves with the submissions made

by Mr. Riad Ameen.

As gleaned from the B-reports filed upon a complaint made by the Department of

Archeology on 06.07.2020 and 15.07.2020, it is common ground that consequent to

allegations that a structure of Buwaneka Hotel described as an antiquity or protected

11

monument has been demolished, investigations commenced during which statements of

several persons have been recorded.

As has been briefed to this Court, B-reports dated 20.07.2020, 23.07.2020 and 28.07.2020

indicate the progress of the case and it is the proceedings dated 07.08.2020 that

constitute the subject-matter of these applications.

As the Journal Entry dated 07.08.2020 makes it clear, the learned SASG Mr. Sarath

Jayamanne PC and the learned President's Counsel Mr. Kalinga Indatissa made

submissions on the question whether an arrest warrant should be issued against the

following persons who have been made suspects;

1. Thushara Sanjeewa Witharana (the Petitioner in CA Writ 217/2020)

2. Nuwarapakshage Pradeep Nishantha Tilakaratna (the Petitioner in CA Writ

221/2020)

3. Adikari Mudiyanselage Chaminda Bandara Adhikari (the Petitioner in CA Writ

216/2020)

4. Nilaludeen Zulfikar (the Petitioner in CA Writ 218/2020).

5. Warnasuriya Patabedige Lakshman Priyantha (the Petitioner III CA Writ

222/2020).

The order of the learned Magistrate of Kurunegala dated 07.08.2020 issuing a warrant of

arrest has been made subsequent to the adduction of evidence of a Police Officer called

Kulathunga. It is this order on 07.08.2020 and the subsequent order On 10.08.2020 to

reissue the warrant that are being impugned in these proceedings as ultra vires and as

having been made without jurisdiction.

Before I proceed to decide on the question of arguability that attend the issue before this

Court, 1 must first dispose of a preliminary objection that the learned SASG raised,

namely the Petitioners must have sought revision instead of an order in the nature of a

writ of certiorari from this Court. That raises the question whether revision, as provided

for in Article 138 and 154P (3) (b) of the Constitution, is the only exclusive remedy that

12

should be sought by the Petitioners. There is a slew of cases that have laid down

threshold requirements around this constitutional remedy of revision such as

exceptional circumstances- See CaderamanpuDe v. Ceylon Papersacks (2001) (1) 3 Sri

LR. 172; Rustom v. Hapangama (1978-79) 2 Sri LR. 225; Atukorale v. Samynathan 41

N.LR 165; Dharmarathna v. Palm Paradise Cabanas (2003) (3) Sri LR. 24; Vanik

Incorporation v.Jayasekara (1997) (2) Sri LR. 365; AG v. Gunawardena (1996) (2) Sri

LR.149.

Moreover, the constitutional language of Article 138 and Article 154P (3) (b) does not

make the remedy of revision exclusive if one were to begin with the language of the

empowermg enactment to ascertain the exclusivity or otherwise of the remedy of

reVISIon.

Both Article 138 along with Article 154P (3) (b) and Article 140 that provide for revision

and writs respectively allude to Courts of First Instance specifically and the remedies

thus are not mutually exclusive.

Article 140 is quite expliCit on the persons and institutions against whom judicial review

lies - "subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the Court of Appeal shall have full

power and authority to inspect and examine the records of any court of First Instance or

tribunal or other institution and grant and issue, according to law, orders in the nature of

writs of certiorari, prohibition, procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against the judge of

any court of first instance or tribunal or other institution or any other person."

As such the Petitioners are not confined to seek only revision and provided that the

Peritioners make out grounds on which certiorari issues, an order of a court of first

instance becomes susceptible to review by a discretionary remedy such as a writ. I need

not labor this point beyond what I would state thus: "once the statutory language makes

it clear that there exist overlapping remedies, the question is whether a statutory remedy

such as revision in the provincial high court, which is also provided for inn Article 154P

(3) (b) is exclusive or is concurrent. If concurrent the question arises whether the

statutory remedy prOvides a sufficient satisfactory alternative to the discretionary

13

remedy such as a writ. There are instances where an alternative remedy may be available

only upon the existence of other factors which are hard to find and difficult to establish

which then does not render that remedy satisfactory. Except for the bare assertion that

revision lies against an order of a Magistrate's Court it was not argued that revision is

more efficacious than this application for judicial review and I therefore would hold

that the Petitioners have properly sought judicial review by virtue of Article 140 of the

Constitution.

Issuance of Notice-Arguability Principles

It has to be borne in mind that in an application for judicial review the stage of notice

demands that a court seized of an application for notice should consider whether the

case is suitable for full investigation at a hearing at which all parties have been given

notice- see R v. Secretary of State for Home Department exp Begum (1990) COD 107.

As a consequence then, one fact that it will take into account is whether the application

for permission or notice relates to a matter that ought to be resolved after full argument.

In other words, at the notice stage, the court considers whether the matter brought

before it is arguable. That entails the conclusion that notice should not be granted if the

application for judicial review i.s unarguable- see R v. Legal Aid Board ex p Hughes

(1993) 3 Admin LR 623 at 62SD in which Lord Donaldson MR held that Notice/

Permission should be granted if an application is prima facie arguable. The permission

judge needs to be satisfied that there is a proper basis for claiming judicial review, and it

is wrong to grant notice without identifying an appropriate issue on which the case can

properly proceed-see R v Social Security Commissioner ex p. Pattni (1993) 5 Admin

LR 219 at 223G. However voluminous the papers, or complex the putative issues, the

task remains the same-R v Local Government Commission ex p . North Yorks County

Council (unreported) 11 March 1994, per Laws J. For a compendious account of

principles that should guide an administrative law court in issuing notice see the

illuminating article entitled "Arguability Principles" by Michael Fordham QC in (2007)

JudiCial Review 12:4, 219-220.

14

Procedure and No evidence rule-the two prongs of impugnation of the warrant

Then, what are the quintessential issues that were contended to be arguable and

unarguable by both counsel who addressed this Court? Mr. Riad Ameen learned Counsel

for the Petitioner in CA Writ Application 218/2020 assailed the order of the learned

Magistrate on two grounds - namely; the procedure adopted by the Magistrate that

finally culminated in the issuance of notice and what I would call the no evidence rule

by which the learned Counsel sought to attack the warrant of arrest issued by the

learned judge. Mr. Sarath Jayamanne PC demurred with an argument that took us

through a raft of documents in order to show that offences have indeed been committed

by the Petitioners. These documents were led before the learned Magistrate of Kurunegala

at the inquiry he conducted on 07.08.2020 and it is afterwards that the learned

Magistrate concluded that cognizable offences had been committed by the Petitioners.

let me make first focus on the first argument of Mr.Riad Ameen that the learned

Magistrate did not have any power to issue the warrant at a B-report stage as such a

power is not expressly conferred on him in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of

1979 (the Code). Does this raise an arguable issue? Methinks it is an issue that has been

gone into.

Though the frontiers of the province of judiCial review have since been expanded, the

traditional boundaries of judicial review as re-echoed and articulated by lord Fraser in

the following tenor remain seminally established.

"Judicial review is concerned not with the merits of a decision but with the manner in which the

decision was made .... J udicial review is entirely different from an ordinary appeal. It is made

effective by the court quashing an administrative decision without substituting its own decision,

and is to be contrasted with an appeal where the administrative tribunal substitutes its own

decision on the merits for that of the administrative officer."-see Re Amin (1983) 2 AC

818,829.

I would thus characterize the first argument of Mr.Riad Ameen as impacting upon the

manner in which the decision to issue the impugned warrant of arrest came to be made.

15

The learned Counsel contended that since what is set out in the B-reports filed by the

Police are made out to be cognizable offences, the recourse to the Magistrate, Kurunegala

to seek authorization for the arrest of the Petitioners is unwarranted and unauthorized.

When the learned Magistrate embarked upon an inquiry and proceeded to issue a

warrant of arrest at the end of it on 07.08.2020, the learned Magistrate usurped a

jurisdiction which he did not have. This constituted the nub of the submissions of the

learned Counsel. The learned SASG countered this argument by traversing that 124 of

the Code empowers a Magistrate to issue processes and therefore the learned Magistrate

did not act ultra vires his powers. In other words, this argument raises the issue of

legality or jurisdictional propriety of the issuance of process and we take the view that

the relative merits of these rival arguments have to be tested at a full hearing. ImpliCit in

the argument of the learned SASG is that a Magistrate can utilize section 124 of the Code

to issue processes even in cases where the police can arrest without a warrant. After all,

what is the prejudice caused to these Petitioners? Whether they are arrested by police

without a warrant or upon a warrant, for a cognizable offence, would entail the same

consequences -so argued the learned SASG. But therein lies the rub. In a case involving a

magistrate's warrant, the legality of the decision making process by the Magistrate

would be influenced by the consideration whether the Magistrate is empowered by law

to decide the matter. But the officers trying to enforce the warrants would be performing

an executive or ministerial function.

Is it an executive or ministerial function of just executing a warrant that is imposed

on police officers in terms of the Code when it comes to cognizable offences? Is not

it a case where they are enjOined by the Code to assess the evidence collected and

make the decision for themselves that the material in their possession discloses a

cognizable offence? Should they seek the interposition of a judge to make that

decision? Should discretionary powers vested in the police be abandoned and abdicated

to a judicial body who causes them to arrest? These are questions that these applications

raise before us in the context of administrative justice and it is these issues that engage a

court in writ applications.

16

It is trite that illegality was articulated by Lord Diplock in the case of Council of Civil

Service Unions v. Minister of the Civil Service (1985) AC 374 at 410; (1984) 2 WLR

174a: (1984) All ER 935 (the GCH~ case) and reasserted in HM Treasury v Ahmed

(2010) UKSC 2, where it was emphasized that the decision maker must understand

correctly the law that regulates his decision making power and must give effect to it.

Therefore the question arises - Did the learned Magistrate correctly understand the

scope of his power when he assumed a power to adopt a procedure as he did before he

arrived at the decision to issue the impugned warrant of arrest? Does Section 124 of the

Code permit him to hear the testimony of a police officer and form an opinion as to a

cognizable offence at a B-report stage? This question becomes markedly pronounced in

the face of Section 32 (1) (b) of the Code which manifests that a reasonable suspicion of

any such cognizable offence has to be formed by a police officer. These are questions

that loom large in these applications. Though the learned SASG cited to Mahanama

Tilakaratne v Bandula Wickremasinghe (1999) 1 SrLLR 372, the authority is of little

assistance to resolve the issue that this Court is confronted with.

Undoubtedly after institution of proceedings in the Magistrates Court by virtue of s.136

of the Code, a Magistrate enjoys the express power of issuing process on evidence by

virtue of s.139 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. It would appear that adduction

of such evidence is not speCified in the provisions dealing with investigation of offences

from Section 109 onwards and at the B-report stage. Whether in the absence of specific

provisions in the Code section 124 of the Code could be invoked in order to confer

jurisdiction on a Magistrate to have evidence led and empower him to form an opinion

as to the existence of a cognizable offence raises arguable issues that demand

consideration at a full hearing.

The learned SASG also sought to justify the adduction of evidence of the police officer at

the B-report stage on a casus omissus provision namely section 7 of the Code which states

the follOwing; "As regards matters of criminal procedure for which special provisions may not have

17

been made by this code or by any other law for the time being in force such procedure as the justice of the

case may require and as is not inconsistent with this code may be followed."

Definitely this is a provision that confers inherent powers on a criminal court and it

affords a criminal court sufficient authority to adopt a procedure which is not in conflict

or inconsistent with the provisions of the Code. However, whether Section 7 of the Code

could afford such protection to the procedure adopted by the learned Magistrate has not

been judiCially commented upon; nor has that procedure been advanced before this court

as has been a permissible practice in criminal courts for a considerable period of time. I

hold the view that whether Section 7 of the Code would validate the procedure adopted

has to be gone into at a full hearing.

It has to be borne in mind that it is through this process adopted by the learned

Magistrate of Kurunegala that he arrived at the conclusion that he was satisfied that a

reasonable suspicion arose as to the commission of offences under the Antiquities

Ordinance No. 09 of 1940 as amended, Public Property Act No.l2 of 1982 and s.408 of the

Penal Code. - see page 09 of the order made by the learned Magistrate, Kurunegala on

07.08.2020. It would appear that he indulged in his own analysis of the material put

forward by the witness and arrived at the conclusion that cognizable offences have been

committed.

This observation made by the learned Magistrate leads one irresistibly to the inference

that it is the learned Magistrate who formed the reasonable suspicion of a cognizable

offence at the B-report stage. The offences that the learned Magistrate refers to in his

order appear to be cognizable - see column 3 of the 1st schedule to the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

It would appear such a finding for cognizable offences has to be reached by the police

officer in terms of section 32 (1) (b) of the Code of Criminal procedure Act No. IS of 1979.

In fact section 32 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. IS of 1979 is quite

expliCit on the formation of this reasonable suspicion to be formed by the police officer

for s. 32 reads as follows:

18

(1) Any peace officer may without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant

arrest any person-

(a)

(b) Who has been concerned in any cognizable offence or against whom a

reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received

or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned;

(c)

(d)

It is crystal clear that there is no corresponding provision for such a formation of a

reasonable suspicion in the mind of the learned Magistrate at the stage when the police

moved him, with the assistance of the officials of the Attorney General's Department, for

the formation of such an opinion at the stage of the B-reports. In terms of section 32 (1)

(b) a police officer can arrest anyone who has committed a COgnizable offence. He need

not get a warrant from a Magistrate. Section 118 (1) of the Code makes it clear that it is

only for non-cognizable offences that police need the prior authorization of a Magistrate.

- see Wljesiri vAG (1980) 2 SRI LR 317 at 340-341. Kulatunga J in T.NFernando v

Nelum Gamage (1994) 3 SrLLR 192 stated that a mere suspicion is not enough. A

reasonable suspicion or credible information is required. If at all the Magistrate were to

rely on section 7 of the Code, the procedure he adopts cannot be inconsistent with the

Code but in this instance, it is legitimate to pose the question that when the formation of

a reasonable suspicion as to a cognizable offence by the Police and the consequent arrest

without an order from a magistrate and without a warrant are speCifically provided

for in section 32 1 (a) of the Code, has the police abandoned their discretionary power

and simply delegated it to the learned Magistrate to form that opinion? Now that the

Magistrate has formed a firm opinion at an anterior stage, the further question arises-

Could he make further orders if any other section in the subsequent stages of the

investigation calls for an independent mind to be brought to bear on these subsequent

orders more particularly if the subsequent orders are going to impinge upon the liberty of

the individual?

19

These are questions that loom as large as life and 1 take the view that all these issues raise

a prima facie case for issuance of notice.

Thus, the assumption of jurisdiction by the learned Magistrate to form the opinion as he

did raises the question whether he assumed a jurisdiction which he did not have. In our

view, this matter has to be fully gone into as questions of law and we are satisfied that

the Petitioners passes the test of arguability criteria.

On the question of sufficiency of evidence which Mr. Riad Ameen raised and the SASG's

answer to this question, I would state that no doubt they too raise arguable issues and

no evidence rule has taken a firm root in administrative law as De Smith's Principles of

JudiCial Review (2nd Edition, 2020 edited by Harry Woolf, Jeffrey Jowell, Catherine

Donnelly and Ivan Hare) runs this illustrative passage of Carnwath lJ in E v Secretary of

State for the Home Department (2004) EWCA Civ 49:

Mistake of fact "giving rise to unfairness" is indeed a ground on which to quash a decision on

judicial review, proVided that ,first, there was a mistake as to an eXistingfact (including as to

the availability of evidence on the matter) ...... the mistake must have played a material (although

not necessarily a decisive) part in the decision-maker's reasoning.

Rival arguments were made as to whether the building in question came within the four

corners of the Antiquities Ordinance and if there is a material error in the decision

making process it is competent to this Court to assay such reasoning on no evidence

rule-see the discussion of E v Secretary of State for the Home Department (supra) by

Paul Craig in (2004) Public law 788 under the title 'JudiCial Review, Appeal and Factual

Error".

In the final analysis we are of the opinion that the Petitioners have met the threshold for

issuance of notice and that there are several matters that require serious consideration by

this Court at a final hearing after notice. In the circumstances, we direct the issuance of

notice on the Respondents.

We are also mindful of the submissions of the learned SASG that any order made by this

Court at this stage should not impede or obstruct any investigation conducted by the

20

Police. We also take the VIew that any arrest of the Petitioners pending the

determination of these applications would render these applications nugatory since the

very foundation of the warrant of arrest is under challenge before this Court. We

therefore make the following interim Orders;

a) Staying the execution of the warrant of arrest ordered by the learned Magistrate

on ("'h August 2020 and the subsequent order until final determination of these

applications and;

b) This order will not impede or obstruct any investigations to be conducted by the

Police nor shall this order impede or obstruct the learned Magistrate to make any

such order to assist investigation in terms of the law upon a request being made by

the Police for such assistance, save and except that the Police shall not arrest the

Petitioners during such investigations and the y h Respondent shall not make any

order remanding the Petitioners until the final determination of these applications.

This Court orders that the Petitioners should appear in Court through their

Attorneys-at-Law, within the course of the day or tomorrow and the learned Magistrate

shall acknowledge their presence until the propriety of the issuance of the warrant of

arrest is finally gone into at a hearing.
