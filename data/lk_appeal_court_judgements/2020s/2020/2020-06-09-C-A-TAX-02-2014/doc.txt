The Appellant is a public quoted company engaged in the cultivation, manufacture and sale of

tea, rubber, coconut, cardamom and other agricultural products. The land covered by the

plantation of the Appellant is owned by the State and given to the Appellant on a long-term

lease.

The issue involved in this matter is whether the income received from the sale of old rubber

trees removed from the existing rubber plantation of the Appellant under the rubber re-

plantation program of the Appellant is liable for Value Added tax (VAT), in terms of the Value

Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 as amended (VAT Act).

The Tax Appeals Commission (TAe) has forwarded the following questions of law as part of the

Case Stated:

1. Are any of the assessments from the subject matter of this appeal invalid and bad in law

by reasons of the Inland Revenue Department failing to comply with the provisions of

section 29 of the VAT Act?

Page 2 of 12

2. Has the Tax Appeals Commission erred in concluding that the agreements entered into

by the Appellant with contractors titled "Agreements for uprooting Old Rubber Trees

and Clearing the Land" were in fact contracts for the supply of timber logs?

3. Has there been a "taxable supply of goods" by the Appellant in relation to rubber trees

under the aforesaid agreements, in terms of the VAT Act?

4. Would the supply of Rubber trees in terms of the aforesaid agreements be an exempt

supply in terms of the VAT Act by reasons of it being:

a. "Unprocessed agricultural products produ ced in Sri Lanka" within the meaning of

item (b) (xxiii) of Part II of the First Schedule of the VAT Act;

or

b. "Agricultural plants" in terms of item (a)(xi) of Part II of the First Schedule of the

VAT Act?

5. Would the supply of rubber trees in terms of the aforesaid agreements:

a. be exempt from VAT by reason of it being in the nature of capital goods used in

making exempt supplies within the meaning item (a) (i) of Part II of the First

Schedule ofthe VAT Act; or

b. be outside the scope of the VAT Act by reason of it being in the nature of capital

goods?

At the outset we observe that this is a Case Stated submitted for the opinion of this Court by

the TAC under section 36 of the VAT Act. IIlthough neither party raised th is issue, we note that

the VAT Act was amended by the Tax Appea ls Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 as amended (TAC

Act) by the repeal of section 36 therein. Hence the TAC has made a reference to this Court

under a repealed provision.

However, it is well-settled that an exercise of power will be referable to a jurisdiction which

confers validity upon it and not to a jurisdiction under which it will be nugatory. This principle

has been applied even to cases where a Statute which confers no power has been quoted as

authority for a particular act, and there was in force another Statute which conferred that

power. [Pieris v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (65 N.L.R. 457), Kumaratunga v.

Samarasinghe, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence and Others (1983) 2 SrLL.R. 63J.

Page 3 of 12

Section llA of the TAC Act enables the TIIC to refer for the opinion of this Court a Case Stated.

Accordingly, we are of the opinion there is a valid reference and make our determination

accordingly.

Although five questions of law were referred to Court by the TAC, the learned counsel for the

Appellant acting in the best traditions of the Bar as always, informed that the Appellant limits

its arguments to the questions of law nos. 2 and 4(a) and 4(b).

Nature af the Contracts

The Appellant has entered into several contracts with contractors for the uprooting and

removal of rubber trees. A sample of one such contract has been marked as R2 in the brief. In

terms of the contract R2, the Contractor has to pay the Appellant a sum of Rs. 1,600/= per tree.

The entire responsibility of uprooting ,md the remova l of the tree is the responsibility of the

Contractor. It goes on to specify that the Contractor must remove everything from the ground

which include even the roots which are the size of pencils.

The contention of the learned counsel for the Appellant is that the contracts are in effect

contracts for the sale of rubber trees in situ (i.e. live rubber trees in the natural form) and the

successful bidder has paid the full sale consideration when the trees are in live form and live

trees are "unprocessed agricultural product", which is an exempt supply within item (b)(xxiii) of

Part II of the First Schedule to the VAT Act. In the alternative the Appellant contends that it sold

agricultural plants which is an exempt supply within item (a)(xi) of Part II of the First Schedule

to the VAT Act.

The analysis must begin with the interpretation of the contracts the Appellant entered into with

Contractors. In this exercise, it must be borne in mind that "interpretation is the ascertainment

of the meaning which the document would convey to a reasonable person having all the

background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the

situation in which they were at the time nf contract" and that "the meaning which a document

... would convey to a reasonable man is nat the same thing as the meaning of its wards. The

meaning of wards is a matter of dictiaw)ries and grommars; the meaning of the document is

what the parties using those wards ar;r:lllst the relevant background would reasonably have

Page 4 of 12

been understood to meon." [per Lord Hoff mann in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd., v. West

Bramwich Building Saciety (1998) 1 All. E. R. 98 at 114-115J. In fact, this approach appears to

have been adopted by Sampayao J. much earlier in Gunatilleke v. Simon Appu [(1918) 2 c.L. Rec.

11J when he held that "a court of justice in construing a document should have less regard to its

letter that to its general sense and intention."

In this context it is important to determine the true nature of the contracts entered into by the

Appellant. The substance test has been used by courts to determine whether a contract is a

contract for the sale of goods or contract for the supply of services [per Greer U . in Robinson v.

Graves [(1935) 1 KB 579 at 587; Atiyah, Adams and Macqueen, The Sale of Goods (11th Ed.; page

27)]. We are of the view that the same test is appropriate in determining the true nature of the

contract in issue.

The true nature of the contracts entered into by the Appellant can be discerned only after

scrutinizing its terms and conditions. The I\ppellant called for public tenders for " Uprooting Old

Rubber Trees". The agreement R2 states that it is for the "uprooting and removal of trees". It

lays down several conditions which regulate the manner in wh ich the contractors must perform

their part of the bargain. It requires the contractor to uproot and clear old rubber trees. The

contractor has to pay the Appell ant a sum of Rs. 1600/= per tree. Furthermore, the contractor

is required to deposit a sum of Rs. 50/= per tree as a security deposit to ensure the due

uprooting and removal of the t ree. Wh ere the contractor fails to duly clean the land, the

security deposit is forfeited.

The learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that in t erms of section 2(1)(a) of the VAT Act,

VAT is chargeable at the time of supply and that in terms of section 4(1) of the VAT Act the t ime

of supply is deemed to be the earlier of p" yment or delivery.

The learned counsel for the Appellant the" referred to several clauses in the agreement R2 and

contended that they evidence that (i) "t the time of signing the agreement the contractor is

required to make a deposit of Rs. 50/= per tree which is to prevent him from defaulting on the

agreement; and t he contractor is required to pay the full sum payable in respect of the number

of trees he intends to remove, and he would only be entitled to remove the trees after he has

Page 5 of 12

paid for the full value of the trees. Accordingly, he contended that the supply for the purpose

of the VAT Act in the instant case was com plete whilst the tree was in situ and therefore the

contract must be construed as being on e for the supply of live trees in their natural form which

is an exempt supply.

We are of the view that this proposition is not tenable in law. The Appellant called for tenders

to uproot and remove non-harvesting ru bber trees. Hence, the trees sold have ceased to be

productive in their natural form. Furthermore, section 4(1) of the VAT Act reads:

"The supply of goods shall be deemed to have taken place at the time of occurrence of

any of the following whichever, occurs earlier; (a) the issue of an invoice by the supplier

in respect of the goods; or (b) a payment for the goods including any advance payment

received by the supplier; or (c) a payment for the goods is due to the supplier in respect

of such supply; or (d) the delivery of the goods have been effected."

The meaning of the word "deemed" w ~s considered and explained by Ranasinghe, J. (as he

then was) in Jinawathie v. EmalinPerera[( l 9R6) 2 Sri.l.R. 121 at 130,131J in the following words:

"In statutes, the expression deemed is commonly used for the purpose of creating a

statutory function so that a meaninr, of a term is extended to a subject-matter which it

properly does not designate . .. Thu s. where a person is deemed to be something it only

means that whereas he is not in I ~d l ity that somethi ng, the Act of Parliament requires

him to be treated as if he were".

Section 4(1) of the VAT Act is a deeming provision to determine the time of supply for the

purposes of section 2(1) of the VAT Act. VI T is charged at the time of supply and as such it is

important to clearly identify the time at v.. 'lich the taxable supply of goods or services takes

place. Section 4(1) of the VAT Act seeks to l cilitate the idcntification of this point of time. The

deeming effect is in our view restricted to ascertaining the time of supply for the purpose of

charging VAT.

Page 6 of 12

It cannot be used to establish that the supply of goods did in fact t ake place at that point of

time. In terms of section 83 of the VAT I\ct "supply of goods" means the passing of exclusive

ownership of goods to another as the owner of such goods. Hence for there to be a "supply of

goods" there must be a passing of "exclusive ownership of goods". That in our view must be

ascertained upon a consideration of the provisions in the Sale of Goods Ordinance dealing with

the passing of property.

The learned counsel for the Appellant concedes this point in submitting that the Sale of Goods

Ordinance applies to the relevant contracts in relation to when the property or title to the

underlying goods passes. However, he contends that the floods forming the subject matter of

the contracts are specific or ascertained goods and that in te rms of section 18 of the Sale of

Goods Ordinance, the property is transferred to the buyer at such time the parties to the

contract intend it to be transferred.

We are of the view that the goods form lP' the subject matter of the contracts between the

Appellant and his contractors are not specific or ascertain ed goods but unascertained goods.

The contracts do not identify the particular trees to be cut. It refers only to the number of trees.

The contracts require the contractor to t~k e over the t rees that are identified by the field

officer. Hence the goods remain unascertained as at th e date of payment and passing of

"exclusive ownership of goods" did not for the purposes of the Sale of Goods Ordinance take

place at the date of payment as submittr y the learned counsel for the Appellant .

Section 19 of the Sale of Goods Ordinan ce sets out different rules for ascertaining the intention

of the parties as to the time at which tl." property in th e' goods pass to the buyer unless a

different intention appears from the terms of the contr ~c t, conduct of the parties and the

circumstances of the case. Ru le 5 specifics that where there is a contract for the sale of

unascertained or future goods by descrir" n, and goods of that description and in a deliverable

state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of

the buyer or by the buyer with the assr'nt of the seller, t he property in the goods thereupon

passes to the buyer. In Kursell v. Timbe" , aerators & Coni a ctors Ltd. [(1927) 1 K.B. 298] the

plaintiff sold to the defendants all the ' 0 S in a Latvian forest which conformed to certain

Page 7 of 12

measurements on a particular date, the huyer to have 15 years in which to cut and remove the

timber. The English Court of Appea l hr ld that the property in the trees did not pass to the

defendants as the goods were not sufficien tly identified.

In the instant case, exclusive ownership ",f the trees did not pass when the payment was made

by the contractor as the goods remai n unascertained. The property in the trees can be passed if

at all only after the trees are ascertained by the field officer i1S stated above.

As long as the trees are in situ on 10' I owned by the ~ t ate property in them cannot be

transferred to the contractor. The prol'crt Y in them can be transferred only after uprooting

them. In these circumstances, the true na ture of the contracts in substance is that they are for

the uprooting and removal of trees for the supply of rubbC'r logs. The consideration for these

contracts was the timber value of the trees uprooted, removed and taken into the possession

of the contractor.

Accordingly, we reject the argument miloe by the learned counsel for the Appellant that the

contracts are in effect contracts for the sllo of rubber trees in situ.

We further conclude that the re has bee I a "taxable supply of goods" by the IIppeliant in terms

of the VAT Act in relation to rubber trees under the aforesaid agreements.

Unprocessed Agricultural Product/Agricultura l Plant

The learned counsel for the Appellant SL ' mitted that even if the Respondents argument was to

be accepted namely that the supply co' Id only take place " fter the trees were uprooted and

cut, whether the mere uprooting and W'lin!; of the tree fo ' removal from lhe estate could be

considered to be "processing" wh ich wou ld (I;sentitle the Appellant to the exemptions referred

to in section 7 of the VAT Act which arc available for an "unprocessed agricultural product" or

"agricultural plant" needs to be considerl'd.

Page 8 of 12

In addressing this contention Court is called upon to interpret the provisions of the VAT Act to

ascertain whether the activity of the Ap pellant under consideration is subject to VAT. In Perera

& Silva Ltd., v. Commissioner General oj Inland Revenue [79(11) N.L.R. 164 at 167J Thamotheram

J. quoted with approval the following statement in C. N. Beatie- Elements of the Law of Income

and Capital Gains Taxation at page 2;

"It has frequently been said that, there is no equity in a taxing statute. This means that

tax being thr. creat ure of statute, liability cannot be implied under any principle of

equity but must be found in t h ~ express language of some statutory provision. The

ordinary canons of construction " pply in ascertaining the meaning of a taxing statute:

"the only safe rule is to look at the words of the enactments and see what is the

intention expressed by these words." If in so construing the statute the language is

found to be so ambiguous that it is in doubt whether tax is attracted or not, the doubt

must be resolved in favour of t/J(' taxpayer, because it is not possible to fall back on any

principle of common law or equit / to Jill a gap in a taxing statute. "The subject is not to

be taxed unless the words of the :.lxing statute unambiguously impose the tax upon him

". However, this does not prevent the court from construing a taxing statute against the

subject, where that appears to be t he correct interpretation of a provision the meaning

of which it may be difficult to understand. Difficulty does not absolve the court fram the

duty of construing a statute; it is only when ambiguity remains after the statute has

been properly construed that thl court is entitled to decide in favour of the taxpayer".

(Emphasis added)

The Appellant contends that the mere act of cutting or felling trees would not amount to

"processing". The learned counsel for the /\ppellant contended that the term "processed"

connotes the performance of a series (I f mrchanical or che mical operations on an object in

order to change or preserve its origin,,1 form and the mere act of cutting the tree would not

change or modify the essential character of the tree and therefore cannot be construed as

"processing".

Page 9 of 12

Reliance was placed on the term "unprocessed agricultural product" and the opposing term

"processed agricultural product" used in Title 7 of the U.S. Code, European Union Regulation

No. 510/2014 and United Kingdom Consumer Protection Act of 1978 and it was submitted that

in all such contexts t he envisaged processing would not cover the mere act of cutting down or

felling an agricultural product such as a live tree.

We note that even these legislative in<lrumen ts do not support the proposition advanced by

the Appellant and does not have a common meaning attributed to the word "unprocessed

agricultural products". While in Title 7 of the U.S. Code "processing" appears to imply doing an

act which makes t he product retail ready, the European Union Regulation No. 510/2014

appears to require steps such as adding chemicals or breaking down or otherwise changing the

character of the agricultural product.

Hence the legal meaning of a word ch mp,es from jurisdiction to jurisdiction depending on its

context and the intf'n tion of the legisliltu re. We are of the view that it is unsafe to define a

word used in the domestic legislation merely by reference to the same word and its meaning in

different foreign legislative instruments.

The learned counsel for the I\ppellant referred to the Guide to the Value Added Tax in Sri Lanka

and submitted that the direcl ions issued by tl", Respondent defines "unprocessed agricultural

produce" to include live t rees, and oth! r pl ants, roots, branches, leaves, flowers, tubes, seeds,

fruits and nuts of trees and other plants i'1 natural form not otherwise processed. He contended

that manifestly live trees are caught up with in the definition of unprocessed agricultural

produce and that the Respondent is estop ped from taking up a contrary position.

In terms of Article 23(1) of the Constitu!ion, il ll laws are enacted and published in the Sinhala

and Tamil, together with a I ,nslation herf'of in English. Any interpretation of the VAT Act

must be therefore be don e bv referenc, 10 the Sinhala Act as section 84 therein states that the

Sinhala text shall pre" ail whe ~ there is ny inconsistency between the Sinhala and Tamil texts

and as the English texi is only a tra nslal in'1.

Page 10 of 12

The term used in the Sinh;,ll text for "unprocessed" is "e5lt5l9 @25)lt5l@". We are of the view

that the term "e5lt5l8 CJ co,, -" is not a lerm of art as used in the VAT Act and must be given a

literal meaning. In.~~ d", I 8010C C ')~@""k,c:l compiled by Harischandra Wijetunge (2005,

1st Ed.) the word ''e:Jr:08('' is defined il5 25)l9 e:Jtsle:l25)0l c:l""@25)&3 tol 25)lS/?,@c:lC B5, l@roe

The subject matter of the cnnt racts between the Appellant and his contractors are not in our

view live trees. The tr'le nil ' I '" of the c( ntracts in substance is that they are for the uprooting

and removal of trees for th,' ur ply of I Ibber logs. The consideration for these contracts was

the timber value of the t " es uprool 'd, removed and taken into the possession of the

contractor. The exemption from VAT riven to "unprocessed agricultural product" does not

cover the instant case w here non-harvesting rubber trees are uprooted and removed. That

involves a process wh irh rh l;'~ S the su l,'ect f-om a rubber tree to firewood, logs and chips.

Accordingly, the subject m r of the c ntrarl s between the Appellant and its contractors are

not live trees within the me Ing of the ,uide to the Value Added Tax in Sri Lanka. It is also not
