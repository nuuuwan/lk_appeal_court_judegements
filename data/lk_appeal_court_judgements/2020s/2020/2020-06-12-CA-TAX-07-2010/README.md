Janak De Silva J.

The Appellant submitted its return for the year of assessment 1991/1992 on 30.11.1992

claiming tax exemption under and in terms of section 17(c) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of

1979 as amended (IR Act) in respect of its profits.

The Assessor by letter dated 30.03.1995 rejected the claim for tax exemption. Aggrieved by this

assessment the Appellant appealed under and in terms of section 117 of the IR Act to the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue by letter dated 18.05.1995.

The Respondent by determination dated 30.06.1998 dismissed the appeal. The Appellant

appealed to the Board of Review by letter dated 17.08.1998 which was dismissed on

23.03.2010.

Aggrieved by the determination of the Board of Review, the Appellant by letter dated

20.04.2010 requested the Board of Review to have a Case Stated referred to this Court which

was allowed.

Page 2 of 15

The questions of law referred to Court are as follows:

(1) Has the Board of Review erred in law by coming to the conclusion that the

determination of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is not time barred?

(2) Has the Board of Review erred in law by coming to the conclusion that the

determination of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is not contrary to the

principles of natural justice?

(3) Has the Board of Review erred in law by coming to the conclusion that despite the long

delay experienced in hearing this appeal the Board of Review was not devoid of

jurisdiction to continue to hear th is appeal?

(4) Has the Board of Review erred in law in interpreting section 17(c) of the Inland Revenue

Act No. 28 of 1979 (as amended)?

(5) In view of the facts and circumstances of the case has the Board of Review erred in law

by coming to the conclusion that it did?

Time Bar

The Appellant has sought to raise two issues under this question of law.

Firstly it is contended that the Respondent failed to determine the appeal within three years in

terms of section 117(12) of the IR Act.

The Appellant appealed against the notice of assessment by letter dated 18.05.1995. The

determination of the Respondent is dated 30.06.1998, which according to the learned counsel

for the Appellant is three years after the date of appeal.

Yet in terms of section 117(12) of the IR Act, the three year time period is to be calculated from

the date on which the petition of appeal is received by the Respondent. The section specifies

that every appeal shall be acknowledged and the date of the letter of acknowledgement shall

for the purposes of the section be deemed to be the date of receipt of such appeal.

Page 3 of 15

Although the brief does not contain a copy of the letter of acknowledgement that date is

referred to in a report prepared by an Assessor as 11.07.1995. Hence the Respondent had time

until 10.07.1998 to make the determination. The determination of the Respondent is dated

30.06.1998. Accordingly, the determination is not time barred.

Secondly, the Appellant contends that although the determination of the Respondent is dated

30.06.1998, the reasons for the determination are dated 20.07.1998. Hence it is submitted that

the reasons did not exist at the date of the determination.

In my view, this issue does not arise on question no. 1 set out in the Stated Case. Yet, I have

previously held that this Court has the power to hear and determine any question of law arising

on the Stated Case provided that the answers to the new questions of law may result in the

confirmation, reduction, increasing or annulling the assessment determined by the

Commission, or requires the remitting of the case to the TAC with the opinion of the Court [The

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue v. Dr. S.S.L. Perera rCA (Tax) 03/2017, CAM.

11.01.2019J.

Section 119 of the IR Act allows any person who is dissatisfied with the determination of the

Respondent to commun icate it in writing within one week of the determination and the

Respondent is then required to transmit his reasons in writing within one month of the date of

determination.

The word "transmit" is defined by Black's Law Dictionary [St Paul, Minnesota: West Group, 7th

Edn., 1999, Bryan A Garner (ed)]. at p. 1505, as follows:

transmit, vb. 1. To send or transfer (a thing) fram one person or place to another. 2. To

communicate

The learned counsel for the Appellant having referred to this definition contends that the

obligation of transmitting within one month is statutorily limited to communicating the reasons

for the determination (which the Commissioner General is required to possess at the time of

the determination) whereas in the present matter the determination and the reasons for the

determination has two days.

Page 4 of 15

However, it appears that this is based on an assumption made by the Appellant [paragraph 16

of the written submissions dated 21.08.2009 before the Board of Review, paragraph 24 of the

written submissions filed in this Court dated 14.02.2017, paragraph 23 of the written

submissions filed in this Court dated 26.08.2019J.

The Respondent has explained that the date which appears on the document containing the

reasons for the determination is the date on which the reasons were signed and dated for the

purposes of transmitting it to the Appellant [written submissions filed by the Respondent

before the Board of Review, page 121 of the Board of Review BriefJ.

As the learned DSG correctly points out other than the bare assertion there is nothing on record

which supports the position put forward by the Appellant. I am inclined to apply the

presumption embodied in section 114(d) of the Evidence Ordinance that official acts have been

regularly performed in the absence of any material to the contrary.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer question no. 1 in the negative.

Rules of Notural Justice

The facts forming the background to question no. 2 are as follows:

The Assessor who rejected the claim for tax exemption by letter dated 30.03.1995 is Mr. P.G.K.

Samarathunge. However, the notice of assessment dated 31.03.1995 was sent to the Appellant

bearing a frank of Mr. E.M.M. Medagoda. The determination together with the reasons for the

determination dated 30.06.1998 was given by the same Mr. E.M.M.Medagoda.

Accordingly the Appellant contended that the determination of the Respondent was contrary to

the rules of natural justice.

Let me restate some fundamental principles that guide this issue.

The principle that a person is disqualified from participating in a decision if there is a real

danger that he or she will be influenced by a pecuniary or personal interest in the outcome is of

general application in public law and is not limited to judicial or quasi-judicial bodies or

Page 5 of 15

proceedings [per Sedley J. in R. v. Secretary of State for the Environment, ex parte Kirkstall

Valley Campaign Ltd. (1996) 3 All E.R. 304 at 325].

Breach of the common law principles of natural justice can be dealt with by the appellate

system in the tax field [R. v. Brentford General Commissioners Ex. p. Chan (1986) S.T.C. 65; R. v.

Commissioner for the Special Purposes of the Income Tax Acts Ex. p. Napier (1988) 3 All E.R. 166;

Bonin v. Mackinlay (Inspector of Taxes) (1985) 1 All E.R. 842].

It is of fundamental importance that justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and

undoubtedly be seen to be done [per Lord Hewart C.J. in R. v. Sussex Justices, ex. parte

McCarthy (1924) 1 K.B. 256].

As the learned counsel for the Appellant submitted, the assessment under appeal has been

issued under the authority of the Assessor who signed the notice of assessment. In the instant

case the delegate of the Respondent and the Assessor who sent the notice of assessment is one

and the same.

There is no allegation that Mr. E.M.M. Medagoda personally benefitted from the determination

he made. Neither is there any allegation of any personal interest. In fact, in his preliminary

ruling dated 23.04.1998 he states, inter alia, as follows:

"Having considered the matter I am of the view that the fact that the assessment in

question has been issued under my stamp should not prevent me from hearing the

appeal. Since I have no connection whatsoever with the assessment, there is no room

whatsoever for occasioning any injustice to the Appellant."

However, that is not the test in determining whether the rules of natural justice have been

breached. In setting out the proper test, I wish to refer to the following excerpt of Lord Hope of

Craighead in Porter v. Magill [(2001) UKHL 67; (2002) A.C. 357] as it succinctly captures the test

in a modern setting:

"100. The "reasonable likelihood" and "real danger" tests which Lord Goff described in R

v Gough have been criticised by the High Court of Australia on the ground that they tend

to emphasize the court's view of the facts and to place inadequate emphasis on the

Page 6 of 15

public perception of the irregular incident: Webb v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 41, 50 per

Mason CJ and McHugh J. There is an uneasy tension between these tests and that which

was adopted in Scotland by the High Court of Justiciary in Bradford v McLeod, 1986 SLT

244. Following Eve J's reference in Low v Chartered Institute of Patent Agents [1919] 2

Ch 276 (which was not referred to in R v Gough), the High Court of Justiciary adopted a

test which looked at the question whether there was suspicion of bias through the eyes

of the reasonable man who was aware of the circumstances: see also Millar v Dickson

2001 SLT 988, 1002L-1003B. This approach, which has been described as "the

reasonable apprehension of bias" test, is in line with that adopted in most common law

jurisdictions. It is also in line with that which the Strasbourg court has adopted, which

looks at the question whether there was a risk of bias objectively in the light of the

circumstances which the court has identified: Piersack v Belgium (1982) 5 EHRR 169,

179-180, paras 30-31; De Cubber v Belgium (1984) 7 EHRR 236, 246, para 30; Pullar v

United Kingdom (1996) 22 EHRR 391, 402-403, para 30. In Hauschildt v Denmark (1989)

12 EHRR 266, 279, para 48 the court also observed that, in considering whether there

was a legitimate reason to fear that a judge lacks impartiality, the standpoint of the

accused is important but not decisive:

"What is decisive is whether this fear can be held objectively justified."

101. The English courts have been reluctant, for obvious reasons, to depart from the

test which Lord Goff of Chieveley so carefully formulated in R v Gough. In R v Bow Street

Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, Ex p Pinochet Ugarte (No 2) [2000] 1 AC 119,

136A-C Lord Browne-Wilkinson said that it was unnecessary in that case to determine

whether it needed to be reviewed in the light of subsequent decisions in Canada, New

Zealand and Australia. I said, at p 142F-G, that, although the tests in Scotland and

England were described differently, their application was likely in practice to lead to

results that were so similar as to be indistinguishable. The Court of Appeal, having

examined the question whether the "real danger" test might lead to a different result

from that which the informed observer would reach on the same facts, concluded in

Page 7 of 15

Locoboil (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd [2000J QB 451, 477 that in the overwhelming

majority of cases the application of the two tests would lead to the same outcome.

102. In my opinion however it is now possible to set this debate to rest. The Court of

Appeal took the opportunity in In re Medicaments and Related Classes of Goods (No 2)

[2001J 1 WLR 700 to reconsider the whole question. Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers

MR, giving the judgment of the court, observed, at p 711 A-B, that the precise test to be

applied when determining whether a decision should be set aside on account of bias

had given rise to difficulty, reflected in judicial decisions that had appeared in conflict,

and that the attempt to resolve that conflict in R v Gough had not commanded universal

approval. At p 711B-C he said that, as the alternative test had been thought to be more

closely in line with Strasbourg jurisprudence which since 2 October 2000 the English

courts were required to take into account, the occasion should now be taken to review

R v Gough to see whether the test it lays down is, indeed, in conflict with Strasbourg

jurisprudence. Having conducted that review he summarised the court's conclusions, at

pp 726H-727C:

"85 When the Strasbourg jurisprudence is taken into account, we believe that a

modest adjustment of the test in R v Gough is called for, which makes it plain

that it is, in effect, no different from the test applied in most of the

Commonwealth and in Scotland. The court must first ascertain all the

circumstances which have a bearing on the suggestion that the judge was biased.

It must then ask whether those circumstances would lead a fair-minded and

informed observer to conclude that there was a real possibility, or a real danger,

the two being the same, that the tribunal was biased.""

In the circumstances of this matter, it cannot be said that there is no "real possibility", or a "real

danger" of bias. It matters not that Mr. E.M.M. Medagoda was convinced he was not biased.

Nor does it matter that he claims to have had no connection whatsoever with the assessment.

The delegate was sitting as adjudicator in a case where the assessment under appeal has been

Page 8 of lS

issued under his authority. A fair-minded and informed observer would conclude that there was

a real possibility, or a real danger, that he was biased.

Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law, [Oxford Oxford University Press, 11th Ed., 2014] at page

401 states:

"Any indication that an adjudicator has prejudged the case, or any indication that he

might do so, will normally disqualify him - as it did where a magistrate prepared a

statement of the sentence halfway through the trial."

For the foregoing reasons, I answer question no. 2 in the affirmative.

Lack of Jurisdiction

The learned counsel for the Appellant contended that the long delay experienced in hearing

this appeal has resulted in the Board of Review being devoid of jurisdiction to continue to hear

the appeal.

It was pointed out that the Appellant appealed to the Board of Review by petition of appeal

dated 17.08.1998 which was received by the Respondent on 19.08.1998. The oral hearing of

the appeal took place on 30.06.2009.

The learned counsel for the Appellant has made detailed submissions on whether the time limit

is directory or mandatory. However, before considering that position, I would like to set out the

applicable time period for determining the appeal.

The IR Act as promulgated did not have a specific time period within which the Board of Review

should hear and determine the appeal. The position was the same when the Inland Revenue

Act No. 38 of 2000 was enacted.

A time limit was first introduced by Act No. 37 of 2003 to the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of

2000. Section 140(10) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000 was amended by introducing

two provisos.

Page 9 of lS

The first proviso states that the Board of Review shall make its determination or express its

opinion as the case may be, within two years fram the date of commencement of the hearing of

such an appeal.

The second proviso states that where the hearing of any appeal has commenced at the date of

commencement of this Act, the appeal shall be determined or an opinion shall be expressed

within two years from the commencement of this Act.

Hence the applicable provision depends on when the hearing of any appeal has commenced.

Firstly, the learned counsel for the Appellant submitted that "hearing" used in section 140{1O)

of the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000 does not refer to an oral hearing alone and that it

must be in the given context have the same meaning as "to hear and determine" and referred

Court to the statement of Selbourne C. in Re. Green [51 UQB 44] where he held that" "hearing"

includes not only its necessary antecedents but also its necessary or proper consequences". It

was further pointed that a hearing does not necessarily mean an oral hearing [Lord Woolf,

Jeffrey Jowell, Andrew Le Sueur et al in De Smith's Judicial Review {London; Sweet & Maxwell,

7th edn., 2013] at p. 428]. It was submitted that the "hearing" must be construed to mean the

date on which the Appellant submitted to the jurisdiction of the Board of Review. Although this

has not been fully explained it appears to mean the date on which the Appellant sent the

petition of appeal to the Board of Review.

Nonetheless in A.M. Mohideen v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [BAU 2015 Vol. XXI

page 171 at 175] Gooneratne J. held that the hearing contemplated is nothing but an oral

hearing. I am in respectful agreement with that part of his conclusion. It reflects a practical

approach and mirrors the approach taken by Courts to civil proceedings [Storer v. American

Express Company (V Sriskantha Law Reports 77)].

The oral hearing in this matter commenced before the Board of Review on 30.06.2009 and the

determination is dated 23.03.2010. Hence the determination was made within the time frame.

Page 10 of 15

Alternatively, the learned counsel for the Appellant contended that the words "commencement

of this Act" in Act No. 37 of 2003 is not a reference to the amending Act No. 37 of 2003 but to

the principal enactment, Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000. Even in this context, hearing

commenced on 30.06.2009 and it makes no difference to the analysis.

Nonetheless, I have no hesitation in rejecting that submission. Adopting such an interpretation

leads to absurdity. The main Act was enacted in 2000 and the amendment in 2003 resulting in

the lapse of 3 years in between. Yet the Appellant contends that a hearing commenced under

the main Act after 2000 is time barred within two years from the commencement of the main

Act even before the amending Act was enacted.

For the foregoing reasons, I answer question no. 3 in the negative.

Section 17(c) 0/ the Inland Revenue Act No. 28 0/1979 (as amended)

The relevant statutory provision reads:

"17C. (1) The profits and income within the meaning of paragraph (a) of section 3 (other

than any profits and income from the sale of capital assets), of any company referred to

in subsection (2), shall be exempt from income tax for a period of five years from the

commencement of the year of assessment in which such company commenced to carry

on business.

(2) The provisions of subsection (1) shall apply to any company which -

(a) commenced to carryon business on or after January 1, 1990;

(b) is, on the recommendation of the Minister in charge of the subject of

Industries, approved by the Minister by notice published in the Gazette on or

before April 1, 1992 as a company to which this section applies; and

(c) is engaged only in carrying on -

(i) an industrial undertaking of pioneering nature in regard to industrial

products or industrial processes; or

Page 11 of 15

(ii) an undertaking for the provision of training in manufacturing

processes, or computer software and computer related development, or

industrial design:

Provided that such undertaking is not an undertaking formed by the splitting up,

re-construction, or acquisition of any business which was previously in

existence."

The conclusion of the Board of Review on this issue is not entirely clear as it reads:

"We hold that the Appellant was formed by the splitting up, re-construction or

acquisition of a business hitherto carried on by "Forbes" which was previously in

existence. The Appellant was not an undertaking formed by the splitting up, re-

construction, or acquisition of any business which was previously in existence as

contemplated under section 17(c) of the Act."

The learned counsel for the Appellant contended that once the Minister makes a notice in

terms of section 17(C)(2)(b) of the IR Act that a company is one to which section 17C applies, it

means that it is a company to which the whole of section 17C applies including the proviso. In

other words, the contention is that it is not up to the Respondent to decide whether the

Appellant qualifies for the exemption in terms of section 17C as that question is determined by

the Minister when the notice is made.

It is observed that section 17C (2) of the IR Act contains several requirements of which one is

the notice made by the Minister. Other requirements are that it commenced to carryon

business on or after January 1, 1990, is engaged only in carrying on an industrial undertaking of

pioneering nature in regard to industrial products or industrial processes; or an undertaking for

the provision of training in manufacturing processes, or computer software and computer

related development, or industrial design.

I am inclined to accept the submission of the learned DSG that if the contention of the

Appellant is correct, there would have been no purpose in including the other conditions

contained in section 17(C) (a) and (c) of the IR Act as well as the prohibition in the proviso. It

Page 12 of 15

would have sufficed for the legislature to have plainly stated that the Respondent would be

required to grant the exemption simply upon the notice made by the Minister.

This is further buttressed by the fact that section 17(C)(2)(b) reads" is, on the recommendation

of the Minister in charge of the subject of Industries, approved by the Minister by notice

published in the Gazette on or before April 1, 1992 as a company to which this section applies;

and". (Emphasis added)

In S.B. Perera v. Standard Chartered Bank and Others [(1995) 1 Sri.L.R. 73] Amerasinghe J. in

holding that section 19 of the Industrial Disputes Act has two parts took into consideration the

fact that they were separated by a semicolon.

Then the issue is whether the Appellant has fulfilled the required criteria to obtain the

exemption. In this regard the application of the proviso to the present case needs to be

examined to ascertain whether the Appellant is an undertaking formed by the splitting up, re-

construction, or acquisition of any business which was previously in existence.

In Shanmuganayagam and Another v. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue [Sri Lanka Tax

Cases Vol. IV page 308] the Supreme Court held that whether an undertaking is a new venture

or an old one will depend on several factors. Transfer of assets from the old business to the so-

called new venture is an indication of "continuation" as opposed to "creation" of a new

venture. Furthermore, the carrying on of the former activities without abandoning them would

indicate and it is not a new distinct or separate business from the old business. Even if the form

of the business be altered resulting in a complete reconstruction by the old venture, it may

nevertheless be a continuation of the old business.

The following evidence supports the fact that the Appellant was formed by the

reconstruction/splitting of Forbes Ceylon Ltd. and as such is not entitled to the tax exemption:

(i) The admission in letter dated 09.01.1996 written by the Appellant to the Respondent

that Forbes Ceylon Limited had pursuant to a tax incentive announced during

1989/1990 commenced production of soy products but that later a new company was

formed as it was a requirement to obtain the tax exemption.

Page 13 of 15

(2) The annual report of Forbes Ceylon Ltd. for the year 1989/1990 where it is stated that

Forbes Ceylon Ltd. had set up a manufacturing division to produce textured soya.

(3) The incorporation ofthe Appellant on 01.04.1991 as a subsidiary of the Forbes & Walker

Group.

(4) The principal activity of the Appellant being the manufacture of textured soya protein.

(5) The acquisition of the following assets by the Appellant from Forbes Ceylon Ltd. for the

purpose of carrying on its principal activity:

(a) land, building, plant and machinery

(b) motor vehicles

(c) office space, accounting personnel, administration, shipping and data processing

facilities.

(d) necessary facilities for marketing the products of the Appellant.

(6) Four Directors of the Appellant are also Directors of Forbes Ceylon Ltd.

For the foregoing reasons, the Appellant is an undertaking formed by the splitting up, re-

construction, or acquisition of any business which was previously in existence.

Hence, I answer question no. 4 in the negative.

Question no. 5 is an all-encompassing question bringing within it question nos. 1 to 4. As

explained above, the answer to question no. 2 is in the affirmative and as such the assessment

confirmed by the Board of Review is annulled.

Accordingly, Court answers the questions of law in the Stated Case as follows:

(1) Has the Board of Review erred in law by coming to the conclusion that the

determination of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is not time barred? No.

Page 14 of 15

(2) Has the Board of Review erred in law by coming to the conclusion that the

determination of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is not contrary to the

principles of natural justice? Yes.

(3) Has the Board of Review erred in law by coming to the conclusion that despite the long

delay experienced in hearing this appeal the Board of Review was not devoid of

jurisdiction to continue to hear this appeal? No.

(4) Has the Board of Review erred in law in interpreting section 17(c) of the Inland Revenue

Act No. 28 of 1979 (as amended)? No.

(5) In view of the facts and circumstances of the case has the Board of Review erred in law

by coming to the conclusion that it did? Yes in view of the answer to Question No.2.

The assessment confirmed by the Board of Review is annulled.

The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment to the Tax Appeals

Commission.
