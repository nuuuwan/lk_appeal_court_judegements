Counsel appearing for the Accused -Appellant informs that she

has gone through the appeal brief very carefully and there is no merit in

this case to proceed the appeal to challenge the conviction. Therefore she

wishes to withdraw the appeal against the conviction and further, she

makes submissions to back date the sentence from the date of conviction

and sentence.

Learned Senior State Counsel concedes the application made by the

counsel for the accused -appellant. Therefore, the conviction is affirmed

and the sentence of 16 years Rigorous Imprisonment imposed by the

learned High Court Judge, to be implemented from the date of conviction

namely, 06.07.2017. The balance sentence is to remain unchanged.

Registrar is directed to send a copy of this order to the Learned High

Court Judge of Matara and the Prison Authorities.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.

Hon. Justice K. Priyantha Fernando.

I agree.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.
