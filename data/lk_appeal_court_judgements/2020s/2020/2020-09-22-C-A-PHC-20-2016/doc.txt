ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

This is an appeal by the 1st Accused-Petitioner-Appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) seeking to set aside the order of

the Provincial High Court of the Central Province in case No. HCRA

109/2014, by which the said Court had dismissed his application to revise

the sentence imposed on him by the Magistrate's Court of Gampola in case

No. 86036/14.

It is evident from the record that the Appellant was attached to the

Gampola Magistrate's Court as an assistant to the Productions Clerk. The

Appellant was charged before that Court along with one Sakiriya Abdul

Rahuman for committing theft and retention of stolen property, offences

2

.. ,

that are punishable under Sections 370 and 394 of the Penal Code

respectively. It was alleged that these offences were committed in respect

of gold jewellery that were kept in Court custody as productions. The

Appellant had pleaded guilty to the two counts on 23.04.2014 and was

sentenced to a ll-month term of imprisonment in respect of the 1st count,

in addition to a fine of Rs.1500.00 with 2-month default term. In respect of

the 2nd count, the Appellant was punished with a 6-month term of

imprisonment suspended for 10 years coupled with a fine of Rs.1500.00

and 2-month default term.

In seeking to revise the ll-month term of imprisonment imposed by

the Magistrate's Court, the Appellant stated that the said sentence is

contrary to the provisions contained in Section 303 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the principles of sentencing. It was

submitted by the Appellant in his written submissions to the Provincial

High Court that the sentence imposed by the Magistrate's Court is

contrary to the principles of sentencing as set out in the judgment of

Kumara v Attorney General (2003) 1 Sri L.R. 139.

The Provincial High Court, in its order of dismissal stated that the

sentence imposed by the Magistrate's Court is not an illegal sentence as

nowhere in the relevant statutory provisions it is stated that a suspended

sentence must be imposed in relation to an offence committed under

Section 370 of the Penal Code and the Appellant failed to satisfy that Court

of the existence of exceptional circumstances.

In the appeal lodged by the Appellant against the order of the

Provincial High Court, it is stated that the Provincial High Court failed to

3

J

take cognizance of the fact that provisions in the Code of Criminal

Procedure (Amendment) Act No. 47 of 1997 has made provision for

imposing suspended sentences.

Section 303(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

as amended had conferred a discretion on the sentencing Court as it states

that" ... a court may make an order suspending the whole or part of the sentence

if it is satisfied, for reasons to be stated in writing, that it is appropriate to do so in

the circumstances."

It is clear that there is no automatic suspension of a prison term

imposed on an accused as there is a duty imposed for the sentencing Court

to satisfy itself" that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances". If such a

Court is inclined to suspend the sentence and in doing so, it must state

reasons in writing. In determining whether to suspend a term of

imprisonment or not, sub paragraphs (a) to (1) of Section 303(1) lays down

some of the applicable considerations.

The Magistrate's Court, in imposing the ll-month sentence on the

Appellant, obviously have intended to emphasise "the need to manifest the

denunciation by the court of the type of conduct in which the offender was engaged

in" since he was an employee of the Court who was dealing with the

production items of the cases that are pending before that Court and had

committed theft on some of the gold jewellery items in that capacity. This

act of the Appellant demands a strong condemnation by the sentencing

Court as the incident would undoubtedly have dented the public

confidence of the Courts system.

\

This Court is of the view that the sentencing Court should have

considered a more severe punishment on the Appellant. However, the

Magistrate's Court must have decided to grant a generous concession

when the Appellant pleaded guilty in the first available opportunity and

had no previous record of any wrong doing, as per the provisions of

Section 303(1)(k) of the said Code.

In view of the above reasoning, this Court holds that the appeal of

the Appellant is devoid of any merit and is accordingly dismissed.
