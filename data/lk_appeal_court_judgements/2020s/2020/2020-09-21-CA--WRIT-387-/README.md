Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner, Sri Lanka Telecom PLC, filed this application

against the Respondents, including the Director General of

Customs, seeking predominantly to quash the Order marked

X13 whereby a forfeiture was imposed on the Petitioner under

the Customs Ordinance in a sum of Rs.5,461,506,186, which

was later mitigated to a sum of Rs.1,820,502,062, on the

premise that the Petitioner imported free of duties and sold

CDMA telephone sets contrary to the Agreement entered into by

the Petitioner with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka.

The Petitioner challenges this decision on several grounds. The

main ground goes to the jurisdiction of the tribunal that made

the said decision.

The Petitioner is an enterprise registered with the Board of

Investment of Sri Lanka.

Section 17 of The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law, No.4 of

1978, as amended, reads as follows:

4

17(1) The Board shall have the power to enter into

agreements with any enterprise in or outside the area of

authority and to grant exemptions from any law referred to

in Schedule B hereto, or to modify or vary the application of

any such laws, to such enterprises in accordance with such

regulations as may be made by the Minister.

(2) Every such agreement shall be reduced to writing and

shall upon registration with the Board, constitute a valid

and binding contract between the Board and the enterprise.

The Customs Ordinance is one such law referred to in Schedule

B to The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law.

The Agreement entered into by the Board of Investment of Sri

Lanka Law with the Petitioner is marked X2.

In paragraph 6 of the statement of objections, the Respondents

correctly say the crucial question to be decided (in this case) is

whether the CDMA Units were sold to the customers in breach of

the Petitioner companys agreement with the Board of

Investment.

In paragraph 34 of the statement of objections, the Respondents

state that R4 lays down the conditions for the duty exemptions

provided for in the Agreement X2 and conclude that the

Petitioner breached the conditions upon which such exemptions

were granted.

Paragraph 34 of the statement of objections reads as follows:

The Respondents submit further that the Board of

Investment wrote to the Managing Director of the Petitioner

Company on 18th August 2014. The said letter laid down

5

the conditions for the duty exemptions provided for in the

Agreement between the Petitioner and the Board of

Investment.

This letter has emphasized that the company is not

permitted to sell the equipment imported under any

circumstances.

The Petitioner is also required to record all such equipment

as assets of the company.

The letter also requires the Petitioner Company to submit a

list of their registered customers within three months of the

date of the agreement.

The Respondents submit that the Petitioner has failed to

comply with all these requirements and have thereby

breached the conditions upon which the exemption was

granted.

A copy of the said letter is marked as R4 and pleaded as

part and parcel hereof.

If I may repeat, the 2nd Respondent imposed the above

staggering forfeiture on the basis that the Petitioner violated the

Agreement X2 read with R4 entered into with the Board of

Investment.

Does the 1st Respondent Director General of Customs or the 2nd

Respondent inquiring officer have the jurisdiction to come to

such a conclusion and impose such a forfeiture? The answer to

this question shall be in the negative.

Clause 7(iii)(a) of the Agreement X2 states:

6

All imports/local purchases of project related capital items

as approved by the Board to be used for and by the

Enterprise (the Petitioner) for the purpose of the business,

shall be free from custom duty during the project

implementation period and free of import restrictions under

the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, No.1 of 1969.

Clause 7(vi) states:

The provisions of the laws set out in Schedule B of the said

Law No.4 of 1978 which are inconsistent with the benefits

and/or exemptions and/or privileges set out in sub-clauses

(i) to (iv) above shall not be applicable to the Enterprise in

relation to the business. The Enterprise shall be subject to

all other laws, not referred to in Schedule B of the Law No.4

of 1978 save and except any exemptions and/or benefits

and/or privileges specifically granted to it by such other

laws and/or orders and/or regulations framed thereunder.

Clause 8 of the Agreement is intensely relevant:

8(i) Any default and/or failure of the Enterprise in

performing or complying with any duty or obligation

imposed on the Enterprise by this Agreement and/or any

failure to comply with any representations, undertakings or

commitments referred to in Clause (1) of this Agreement, the

Board may by notice in writing, immediately withdraw

and/or cancel all rights, privileges and benefits conferred in

terms of this Agreement in toto or in part, effective from the

date as may be specified by the Board.

8(ii) In the event of the Board withdrawing and/or

cancelling in toto or in part the rights, privileges and

7

benefits as aforesaid the approval granted to the Enterprise

shall deemed to have been cancelled, and all rights and

privileges conferred upon the Enterprise for and in

connection with conducting and/or operating the said

business shall thereupon cease, without prejudice to any

claim by the Board against the Enterprise arising out of the

breach of any covenant or term of this Agreement. The

Enterprise if so determined by the Board, shall be liable to

pay the customs duty and other levies as determined by Sri

Lanka Customs on the terms imported on duty free basis by

the Enterprise for the purpose of the said business. The

Enterprise shall have the right, if approved by the Board in

writing to sell/transfer the items referred to above to any

other Enterprise eligible for duty free facility in respect of

same or to re-export same free of customs duty or

restrictions provided the Board reserves to itself the right to

cause or permit to be caused the examination of such items

goods for the purpose of this Agreement.

In terms of clause 8, the violation of the Agreement shall be

decided by the Board of Investment, not by any other party,

including Sri Lanka Customs, and once it is so decided by the

Board of Investment, the Petitioner shall be liable to pay the

customs duty and other levies as determined by Sri Lanka

Customs on the items imported on duty free basis by the

Enterprise [the Petitioner] for the purpose of the said business.

The Respondents have no authority to decide that the Petitioner

breached the Agreement entered into between the Petitioner and

the Board of Investment and order payment of customs duty on

the imported CDMA telephone sets. The Board of Investment

8

does not allege violation of the Agreement, nor has it cancelled

the approval granted to the Petitioner. Clearly the Respondents

have acted ultra vires in holding an inquiry without any

participation of the Board of Investment and imposing forfeiture

in a sum of Rs.5,461,506,186, which was later mitigated to

Rs.1,820,502,062.

There is no necessity to consider the other grounds of challenge.

I quash the said decision by certiorari. I also direct the 1st

Respondent by mandamus to refund the cash deposit and

return the Bank Guarantee to the Petitioner.

The reliefs as prayed for in paragraphs (b), (d), (e) and (g) of the

prayer to the petition are granted.

The application of the Petitioner is allowed with costs.
