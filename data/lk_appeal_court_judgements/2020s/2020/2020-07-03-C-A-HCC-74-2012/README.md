ACHALA WENGAPPULI, T.

The 1st and 2nd accused-appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1 st and 2nd

Appellants) were indicted before the High Court of Tangalle for committing

robbery of Rs. 125,000.00 and a mobile phone worth Rs.10,000.00 from Vidane

Arachchige Gunadasa on or about 08.09.2007 at Walasmulla.

Upon entering a plea of not guilty, the trial against the Appellants

proceeded with the evidence of the virtual complainant Gunadasa, his son Pushpa

Kumara and Ariyapala as the three lay witnesses who testified for the prosecution.

It is the prosecution version of events that on the day of the robbery, the

two Appellants, who arrived in a motor cycle, entered the trading store of

Gunadasa and threatened him with a gun and robbed his cash and phone. It was

the 2nd Appellant who robbed Gunadasa at gun point while the 1st Appellant

held his son Kumara and Ariyapala in the store room, facilitating the act of his

colleague. Having robbed Gunadasa the two Appellants have sped off in the

motor cycle.

A complaint of robbery was lodged in Walasmulla Police on the same day

by the virtual complainant and his son claiming that they could identify the two

robbers if seen again. Ariyapala too made a statement.

2

After about 6 weeks since the robbery, Deniyaya police had alerted

Waiasmulla Police of the arrest of two Appellants, on 21.10.2007. An officer from

Waiasmulla Police recorded statements of the two Appellants on 22.10.2007.

The two Appellants were identified by the three witnesses at an

identification parade held in the Magistrate's Court of Waiasmulla on 29.10.2007.

During the trial, it was admitted among the prosecution and the Appellants that

the said identification parade was held properly except to the reservation that

there were multiple parades held, under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

It was elicited through the Registrar that the identification parade notes

indicate that Gunadasa identified both the Appellants while Kumara and Ariyapala

only identified the 2nd Appellant.

When the trial Court called for the defence, at the close of prosecution the

Appellants made statements from the dock. The 1st Appellant stated that he was

arrested by Urubokka Police on 14.10.2007 and handed over to Deniyaya Police,

having assaulted him. He was kept in Deniyaya Police for five days and this

allegation was foisted on him. The 2nd Appellant too made a statement on the

same lines and claimed that he was arrested on 16.10.2007.

3

The trial Court found the two Appellants guilty to Robbery and sentenced

each of them to serve a term of 12 years imprisonment, in addition to the

imposition of a fine of Rs. 10,000.00 with a two-year default term.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the Appellants have

preferred the instant appeal. At the hearing of their appeal the Appellants have

primarily challenged the evidence of the prosecution in relation to proving of

their identity.

Learned Counsel for the 1st Appellant contended that the claim of

identification by the prosecution witnesses were made under "traumatic and

difficult circumstances" and when considered against the fact that the robbers

were wearing "full face helmets" at the time of committing robbery, the

purported claim of identity is rendered highly unreliable. She referred to the

evidence where Pushpa Kumara, although claimed that the robber had held him

at gun point, failed to identify that person at the identification parade and only

pointed out the 2nd Appellant, who allegedly robbed his father. Learned Counsel

also referred to the evidence of the "independent witness" where he described

the 2nd Appellant to the Police as a "lean person about six feet tall" but pointed

out a person who had a overlapping or impacted tooth "o!!lG ':;Cl"at the

identification parade because only the 2nd Appellant had such a tooth, among the

persons who were paraded in front of the witness.

4

Learned Counsel for the 2nd AppeIlant invited attention of Court to the

evidence of Pushpa Kumara who said that he remembered the 2nd AppeIlant since

he was "weIl built" person with curly hair and looked like an "OIC". He also

referred to the witnesses claim that the 2nd AppeIlant had a "roe ~tll". This

evidence, according to learned Counsel, is in conflict with the description of the

2nd Appellant, as provided by witness Ariyapa/a, who claims it was a "tall lean

" man .

In her reply, learned Senior State Counsel referred to the admission of the

AppeIlants that the identification parades were held properly and none of them

made any adverse remark to the said parade or to the manner in which they

were identified. She also submitted none of the complaints to the identification,

made by the Appellants in this Court, were mentioned by them before the trial

Court, in marking the said admission. She further submitted though the

witnesses admitted the Appellant wore helmets, there was no material before the

trial Court to conclude that they were fitted with visors which made it difficult to

observe the facial features of its wearers and therefore the Appellants were

properly identified by the witnesses at the identification parade and thereafter

during the trial.

When the evidence of the lay prosecution witnesses is examined, it is

revealed that all of them have admitted that the Appellants were wearing

helmets.

5

The evidence indicate that the two Appellants have arrived at the scene

riding motor cycles. It is therefore natural for one to wear a helmet especially it is

an offence not to wear one, when riding on a motor cycle. However, the

prosecution did not clarify as to, when they entered the trading store of Gunadasa

whether they continued to wear them.

Witness Gunadasa was emphatic that when they entered his store only one

of them had a helmet on. His son Pushpa Kumara supports this claim. His

evidence is only the 2nd Appellant had his helmet on. The witness admits the

helmet had a dark coloured visor but he could see the face of its wearer. Witness

Ariyapa/a in his cross- examination admitted that both of them wore helmets and

did not remove them. He identified the 2nd Appellant on his height and "roe

It is significant to note that, though the three witnesses attributed different

roles to each of the Appellants during the act of robbery, there was no single

contradiction marked off their evidence in relation to that aspect. They were

consistent with the accusation from the identification parade to the trial before

the High Court. The conduct of the witnesses during the identification parade, as

recorded by the Magistrate, indicates that they identified the Appellant without

making a misidentification by pointing to a participant instead of an Appellant.

The Appellant's collective challenge on the claim of the prosecution that

they were identified by the prosecution witnesses during the identification

parade, was mounted on two planks. The Appellants challenge that the claim of

identification of persons, seen with helmets, is unreliable. They also challenge the

6

identification on the basis that they were shown to the prosecution witnesses by

the Police, after their arrest.

In relation to the first of these two contentions, this Court notes that

despite the submission by the learned Counsel for the Appellants that the

identification is improbable because the robbers wore "full face helmets" that

fact is not supported by evidence. All three prosecution witnesses agree that the

two Appellants had their helmets on. Only Ariyapa/a said in evidence that both

of them had their helmets on during the time they were in the stores of Gunadasa.

Even then, the witness claimed that he identified the 2nd Appellant, owing to a

facial feature and also by his stature, which had etched in the mind of the

witness. Of the three witnesses, Gunadasa could be considered as a disinterested

witness, as indicative by his conduct when the news reached that the two robbers

were arrested. He had shown no interest to know who they were and had merely

participated in the identification parade. The notes of the identification parade

indicate that Ariyapa/a had shown no hesitation in identifying the 2nd Appellant

as he had pointed out the latter no sooner he inspected the parade. Having

indicated there was another, at the time of robbery he did not venture to identify

the 1st Appellant, nor did he pointed out to a wrong person in the belief he

identified the 1st Appellant.

This witness was emphatic that he saw the 2nd Appellant only at the

identification parade since the robbery and there is no material before the trial

Court to reach an inference contrary to that claim.

7

In addition to Ariyapala, PushpaKumara also identified the 2nd Appellant at

the identification parade, while Gunadasa identified both the Appellants. These

two witnesses also assert that they saw the faces of the two robbers at the time of

commission of the offence and had identified them at the identification parade

held after their arrest.

In view of the consistent position of the three witnesses have noted facial

features of the two robbers at the time of the commission of the offence and

which claim had been subsequently confirmed by their positive identification of

the two Appellants without making a mistake during the identification parade,

this Court concurs with the conclusion reached by the trial Court that the

witnesses have properly identified the Appellants at the identification parade.

With the view expressed in the preceding paragraph, in relation to the 1st

challenge this Court now proceeds to consider the other complaint of the

Appellants that they were shown to the prosecution witnesses by the Police after

their arrest.

This contention is founded on the evidence of the witness Pushpakumara

who stated that he was asked to come to Police as they have arrested two

suspects. Apparently only his father had complied with the directive. Ariyapala

too had received a similar direction from the Police which he preferred to ignore.

He also knew that Gunadasa and Pushpakumara too were also called by Walasmulla

Police, but the witness was confident none of them went to Police in compliance

8

with the said directive. Gunadasa never said he was called by the Police nor he

was suggested on those lines by the Appellants.

Learned Counsel for the Appellants, therefore contends that the

subsequent identification is tainted since there was evidence that the suspects

were shown to the witnesses.

The evidence does not extend to infer that there was a real opportunity for

the witnesses to observe the features of the Appellants, when they were being

held as suspects in Police custody.

IP Ariyawansha of Walasmulla Police gave evidence before the trial Court.

His evidence was to the effect that the 1st information about this robbery was

received by his station at about 7.30 a.m. by telephone, on 07.09.2007. Deniyaya

Police arrested the Appellants after about 1 1/2 months from the robbery. Their

statements were recorded on 22.10.2007 by PC 26479 Mahanama of Walasmulla

Police, who testified that he recorded the Appellants' statements just before they

were being produced before Court in Deniyaya. The identification parade was

held at the Magistrate's Court of Walasmulla on 29.10.2007.

During cross-examination of the Police witnesses, the Appellants did not

suggest that they were kept in detention for days and were shown to the

prosecution witnesses. During the identification parade, where the Appellants

were represented by their Counsel, they have taken up the position that they

were shown to the prosecution witnesses. A specific allegation was made by the

2nd Appellant to the Magistrate to the effect that they were photographed by the

9

prosecution witness No. 1, using a mobile phone. Strangely, none of the

Appellants cross -examined any of the three prosecution witnesses on the basis

that they have seen them whilst in detention in the police cell, prior to the

identification parade. There was no suggestion to Gunadasa that he had taken

photograph of the Appellants using a mobile phone, either. Although both

Appellants accused Deniyaya Police for keeping them in detention for several

days in the Police, in their statements from the dock, they did not assert that they

were shown to the prosecution witnesses and were photographed. When the

notes of the identification parade were admitted under Section 420, the

Appellant did not add any qualification that the said admission was subject to

the disqualification of being shown to the prosecution witnesses during police

detention. Prosecution witnesses Gunadasa and Pushpakumara testified that they

did not go to Police, although they were sent for, after the arrest of the

Appellants. The Appellants chose not to challenge that position.

The only instance where this position was put across by the Appellants

appear during cross-examination of Ariyapa/a (at p.l08 of the brief) where the

witness merely said "yes", when he was suggested with three different positions

interwoven in one suggestion. Learned Counsel for the Appellant asked the

question;

Q: Ol.!lS@m 3\0l <;.!lSrnC) qzolOlCl G@.!lS @)I:llol<; Cio(9J. ~I:ll hlo)

(3)0I0l). ~I:ll @.!lS<; g@.!lS?

10

This particular witness admitted that it was his maiden experience as a

witness testifying in Court, and obviously was in an state of stress. He would not

have known the importance of answering into the three different suggestions put

to him by the Counsel, separately. The above suggestions referred to the fact that

the witness is lying. Then it refers to two positions in one sentence that the

Appellant was shown at the Police and it was due to his ".!!)G c:;a> " only the

witness did identify the 2nd Appellant.

Probably the witness could only comprehend the question whether he did

identify the 2nd Appellant due to ".!!)G c:;a>", among the three contentions

advanced by the learned Counsel, since that had been his consistent position

throughout, in examination in chief as well as in cross-examination.

In view of these considerations, there was no material before the trial

Court to conclude that the prosecution witnesses had any opportunity of seeing

the Appellants prior to the identification parade, which gave them an

opportunity to closely observe the facial features of the two robbers, unhindered

by the obstacle in the form of helmets.

Having anxiously considered the evidence of the prosecution witnesses vis

a vis the position of the Appellants, this Court is of the considered view that no

reasonable doubt arises on the prosecution claim of identity upon the

proposition that the witnesses have had an opportunity of seeing the Appellants,

whilst in police custody, before they were identified at the identification parade

held at the Magistrate's Court of Walamulla.

11

In the circumstances, this Court finds that there is no merit in the appeals

of the 1st and 2nd Appellants. The conviction of the Appellants and the sentence

imposed on them is therefore affirmed by this Court.

Accordingly, the appeals of the 1st and 2nd Appellants stand dismissed.
