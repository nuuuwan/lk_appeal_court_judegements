Manohara Jayasinghe SSC for the Respondents

Decided on: 05.02.2020

Janak De Silva J.

This order pertains to two applications. Firstly, it addresses the application made

by the Respondents to accept document marked RX as part of the record . Secondly,

it addresses the application of the Petitioner to amend the prayer by including a

new prayer d) which reads:

"d) to grant interim relief, to call for the cash reward lists CIB/RL/Os/2012

and ClB/RL/06/2012 related to this matter"

Both these applications are regulated by Rules 3(8) of the Court of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 (Rules) which reads:

"A party may, with the prior permission of the Court, amend his pleadings,

or file additional pleadings affidavits or other documents, within two weeks

of the grant of such permission, unless the Court otherwise directs. After

notice has been issued, such permission shall not be granted ex parte."

By this rule court is given discretion on whether to allow amendment of pleadings,

or file additional pleadings affidavits or other documents. However, the Rules are

silent on the matters that must be considered by court in exercising this discretion.

In my view Court must approach this task with the interest of justice uppermost in

mind. At the same time this Rule should not be used by parties who by negligence

omitted to produce documents.

I will first address the application of the Respondent to accept document marked

RX as part of the record. RX is the proceedings dated 17.08.2009 of customs inquiry

case no. POM/822/2009. The said inquiry pertains to the importation of a used

BMW car which was brought to Sri Lanka under what is called as a "carnet

certificate" by a person which was not re-exported within the validity period and

kept in the custody of that person without paying the due levies to the customs.

These inquiry notes, according to the Respondents pertain to document marked R4

with their objections and is intended to establish that document marked R4 relates

to a carnet transaction as this was denied by the Petitioner This issue becomes

relevant to this application as the contention of the Petitioner is that he is the

person who supplied information to the Customs on the abuse of the camet scheme

which led to its detection. The Petitioner contends that accordingly he is entitled to

the reward.

The document RX shows that the customs inquiry took place on 17.08.2009

whereas the date on which the Petitioner is said to have supplied the information

is much later. Hence the document RX is material to this application in that it is vital

in the ascertainment of the truth of the statement of the Petitioner. I therefore

make order accepting the document RX as part of the record.

The next issue to be determined is whether the application of the Petitioner to

amend the prayer should be allowed. The Petitioner claims that he had to amend

the prayer due to the 4th Respondent making a false statement that there are no

appeals or court cases pending in respect of this case.

In this application the Petitioner is seeking a writ of mandamus directing tat he be

paid his legitimate share of cash rewards in all cases of carnet abuses inquired into.

Therefore, the amendment sought is directly relevant to the main issue in this

application and therefore I allow the amendment sought to be made by the

Petitioner.

Parties shall bear the costs of this application.
