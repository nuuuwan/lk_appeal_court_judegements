Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

When this matter was taken up for argument on 6th August 2020, the learned

Counsel for all parties moved that this Court pronounce its judgment on the written

submissions that have already been filed by the parties.

The Petitioner is a limited liability Company incorporated under the provisions of the

Companies Act No. 7 of 2007. The Petitioner states that it is the owner of a

condominium property situated in Milagiriya, Colombo 4. The said property

comprises of eight residential units, together with common elements, and is

depicted in Condominium Plan No. 1563 dated 18th December 1973, marked P3

which Plan the Petitioner states has been registered in the Register of the 1st

Respondent maintained at the Land Registry, Colombo.1

The above residential units bear assessment Nos. 9, 11, 15, 9 1/1, 9 1/2, 9 1/3, 9 1/4

and 9 1/5, Ransivi Lane, Colombo 4. The dispute that has given rise to this application

relates to Unit No. 2 bearing assessment No. 11. The Petitioner states it purchased

Unit No. 2 of the said Condominium property in 2009 from Ram Naraindas

Mirchandani.2 The 5th Respondent had been the tenant of the said Unit, until she

passed away in October 2016. The 5A and 5B Respondents, who are her sons, have

been substituted in place of the 5th Respondent. Any reference to the 5th

Respondent, where relevant, shall include a reference to the 5A and 5B Respondents,

as well.

The Petitioner states that it came to know in September 2011 that the 5th

Respondent and the tenant in premises bearing assessment No. 9, Mrs. T.

Kanapathipillai, had constructed a shed in the common area at the front of the

building, causing obstruction of the common parking area and thereby blocking

access to the building. The Petitioner had accordingly submitted a complaint dated

25th October 2011, marked P5 to the 1st Respondent, the Condominium

Management Authority, by which the Petitioner informed the 1st Respondent inter

alia as follows:

1 See Declaration made under Section 5(1) of the Apartment Ownership Law No. 11 of 1973, annexed to the Counter Affidavit of the Petitioner marked X. 2 Vide Deed of Transfer No. 9680, marked P4.

4

All the apartments were given on rent, and the tenants were not vacating.

After we transferred the building to the name of our company Happy Homes

Ltd, we managed to clear six apartments of its tenants by negotiations.

The last two tenants who are not vacating and living in apartments number 9

and 11 have built (a) shed in the common area at the front of the building

making it an inconvenience for us to access the rest of the building. Also, it is

blocking the common parking.

Acting on the said complaint P5, the 4th Respondent had conducted a field

inspection of the said Condominium property. By his report dated 15th November

2011 marked P6, the 4th Respondent had informed the 2nd Respondent, the General

Manager of the 1st Respondent of the following:

Section 27 of the Condominium Management Authority Law No. 10 of 1973, as

amended3 (the Act) defines an unauthorised construction as follows:

3 See Section 3 of the Common Amenities (Amendment) Act No. 24 of 2003, by which the name of the principal enactment, the Common Amenities Law was amended to read as the Condominium Management Authority Law.

5

unauthorized construction means any improvement or alteration to the

condominium parcel or ancillary parcel appurtenant to such condominium

parcel, any improvement or alteration to the common elements, any parceling

or subdivision of the land parcel where the condominium property or semi

condominium property is constructed, the erection or re-erection of sub-

structures and the construction of works on the land parcel, or any change in

the use for which land parcel or any building or any structure thereof is used,

without a valid permit from the authority who have been empowered by law to

approve the building plan, or contrary to any term or condition set out in the

permit issued in respect of the building plan approved for the relevant

Condominium Property or Semi Condominium Property.

Thus, it is clear that the 5th Respondent has engaged in an unauthorised construction

by placing obstructions in the common elements and thereby has changed the use of

the common elements and altered the common elements of the said Condominium

Property. For convenience, I shall refer to such obstructions as an unauthorised

construction.

Section 9A of the Act sets out the procedure that should be followed with regard to a

complaint such as P5. Section 9A(1) reads as follows:

Where the Authority receives a complaint or receives information that an

unauthorized construction has been erected or is being erected in any registered

or unregistered Condominium Property or Semi Condominium Property, the

Authority shall cause a notice in writing to be served on the owner of the

condominium parcel and a copy of such notice to be served on each occupier of

such condominium parcel and the management corporation if any, who is

erecting or has erected such unauthorized construction in the condominium

parcel, or the common element and direct such owner, occupier or management

corporation, as the case may be, to be present at an inquiry on a date, time and

place, to be specified in the notice and to show cause

(a) why the Authority should not prohibit such person from proceeding with

the construction ;

6

(b) why the unauthorized construction should not be demolished and the

Condominium Parcel restored to its original condition.

In terms of Section 9A(2), The persons present at the inquiry in pursuant to the

receipt of a notice issued under subsection (1), shall be given an opportunity of being

heard ....

Thus, the person who has engaged in an unauthorised construction must be afforded

an opportunity of explaining his/her position, in the manner set out in Section 9A of

the Act.

By a notice dated 23rd November 2011 marked P7, the 2nd Respondent had

forwarded a copy of the complaint to the 5th Respondent, and requested her to show

cause by 7th December 2011 as to why the complainants application should not be

considered. As the 5th Respondent had not responded, the Assistant General

Manager (Legal) of the 1st Respondent, by a letter dated 19th December 2011 marked

P8 had requested the 5th Respondent to be present for a discussion on 11th January

2012. The 5th Respondent had also been informed that this discussion will be

conducted by the Inquiring officer who is appointed by the Condominium

Management Authority to inquire into this matter. If you fail to be present for this

discussion, steps will be taken to proceed with the ex-parte inquiry and order will be

issued on the available facts.

Although the Inquiry had been held on 11th January 2012, the 5th Respondent had

not been present. The minutes of the inquiry marked P8x maintained by the 1st

Respondent, discloses the following:

The Inquiry Officer had thereafter directed that fresh notices be served on the 5th

Respondent, and re-fixed the inquiry for 30th January 2012.

The 2nd Respondent had thereafter sent the following letter dated 20th January 2012

marked P9 to the 5th Respondent:

The 5th Respondent had not been present at the inquiry scheduled for 30th January

2012, in spite of P9 having been sent to her. As a result, the inquiry had been

postponed once again to 28th February 2012. Even though the 5th Respondent had

not been present on 28th February 2012 as well, the inquiry had finally been taken up

on that date, as borne out by the minutes of the inquiry marked P10.

Section 9A(2) sets out the steps that the 1st Respondent can take at the end of the

Inquiry that is conducted in terms of Section 9A. The relevant parts of Section 9A(2)

are re-produced below:

....where the Authority is of the opinion that such construction is an

unauthorized construction, it may direct, such owner or occupier or

management corporation or other person, as the case may be:

(a) not to proceed with such unauthorized construction; or

(b) to restore the condominium parcel or an accessory parcel appurtenant to

the condominium parcel or common element to its original condition; or

(c) to take such other measures for the purpose of compliance with the

conditions set out in the permit subject to which the Condominium

Property or Semi Condominium Properly has been constructed. By letter dated 5th June 2012 marked P11, the 2nd Respondent had informed the 5th

Respondent as follows:

It was revealed at the inquiry that you being the tenant of No. 11, Ransivi Lane,

Colombo 4 have placed pots, bird cages, and fish tanks in the Common area

(front) which has resulted in blocking of Common area and access to the other

apartments of the Condominium building.

Therefore you are hereby directed to remove the said obstructions within 14

days of receipt of this letter.

10

If you do not do so the Management Corporation is entitled to remove the said

obstructions of the Common elements and recover all expenses incurred by the

Management Corporation.

The Petitioner has produced marked P12 a letter dated 17th June 2012 written by

the 5th Respondent and Ms. T. Kanapathipillai. The title of the said letter is a

reference to P11, thus confirming that the 5th Respondent received the Order of the

1st Respondent. Other than for stating that, we are not blocking any common area

and access to any other property, the 5th Respondent has not taken any steps to

challenge the findings of the 1st Respondent.

I must state that the 1st Respondent has scrupulously followed the procedure laid

down in the Act and afforded the 5th Respondent several opportunities of explaining

her position. Furthermore, the 4th Respondent as well as the Inquiry Officer have

examined the Site and seen for themselves the factual circumstances relating to the

complaint of the Petitioner, and thereby satisfied themselves of the authenticity of

the complaint.

By letter dated 18th November 2014 marked P13, the Secretary, Management

Corporation had informed the 1st Respondent that the 5th Respondent has not taken

any steps to comply with the said Order communicated to her by P12, and moved

that the 1st Respondent take action as a period of 2 years have lapsed since P11

was issued. Upon the failure by the 1st Respondent to take any further steps, the

Petitioner filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to take steps in terms of

Section 9A of the Act;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to remove and/or demolish

the unauthorised construction carried out by the 5th Respondent.

I shall consider at the outset the matters that must be satisfied by a party seeking a

Writ of Mandamus. The Supreme Court in Ratnayake and Others vs C.D.Perera and

others4 held that:

4 [1982] 2 Sri LR 451.

11

The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public

authority to do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command

issued by the superior Court for the performance of public legal duty. Where

officials have a public duty to perform and have refused to perform, Mandamus

will lie to secure the performance of the public duty, in the performance of

which the applicant has sufficient legal interest. It is only granted to compel the

performance of duties of a public nature, and not merely of private character

that is to say for the enforcement of a mere private right, stemming from a

contract of the parties.

The above position has been reiterated in Jayawardena vs. Peoples Bank5 where it

was held that:

Courts will always be ready and willing to apply the constitutional remedy of

mandamus in the appropriate case. The appropriate case must necessarily be a

situation where there is a public duty. In the absence of a public duty an

intrusion by this Court by way of mandamus into an area where remedial

measures are available in private law would be to redefine the availability of a

prerogative writ.

In Rajeswari Nadaraja v. M. Najeeb Abdul Majeed, Minister of Industries and

Commerce and Others6 Aluwihare, J held that, In an application for a writ of

mandamus, the first matter to be settled is whether or not the officer or authority in

question has in law and in fact the power which he or she refused to exercise. As a

question of law, it is one of interpreting the empowering statutory provisions. As a

question of fact, it must be shown that the factual situation envisaged by the

empowering statute in reality exists.

Thus, while the public authority must be under a legal or public duty to carry out the

act which a petitioner demands, the petitioner must have a legal right to the

performance of such public duty. In Kaluarachchi vs Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

and Others,7 Fernando J, referring to the judgment in Credit Information Bureau of

5 [2002] 3 Sri LR 17. 6 SC Appeal No. 177/15; SC Minutes of 31st August 2018. 7 SC Appeal No. 43/2013; SC Minutes of 19th June 2019.

12

Sri Lanka vs M/s Jafferjee and Jafferjee (Pvt) Limited8 reiterated that, the

foundation of mandamus is the existence of a legal right. A court should not grant a

Writ of Mandamus to enforce a right which is not legal and not based upon a public

duty.

The principle relief that is sought by the Petitioner is for the 1st Respondent to

remove the obstructions of the Common elements that the 1st Respondent has

satisfied itself, exists vide the Inspection Report marked P6, and the report of the

Inquiry Officer vide 2AR1.

I shall first consider whether the 1st Respondent has the power to demolish

unauthorised constructions. In terms of Section 5 of the Act, the objects of the 1st

Respondent shall inter alia be to:

(a) Control, manage, maintain and administer the condominium parcels, the

common elements and the common amenities of the Condominium Property or

Semi Condominium Property;

(d) Remove all such unauthorized constructions erected or carried out by the

respective owners or occupiers of such condominium parcels or by any person,

contrary to the registered condominium plan of the Condominium Property or

the registered Semi Condominium Plan of the Semi Condominium Property.

Section 6 of the Act sets out the powers of the 1st Respondent. In terms of Section

6(j):

For the proper carrying out of its objects the Authority shall exercise any one or

more of the following powers:

(j) enter, either by itself or by its duly-authorized agents, at all reasonable

times, any condominium parcel ...... for the purpose of removing or

demolishing unauthorized constructions of the Condominium Property or

Semi Condominium Property ....

8 [2005] 1 Sri LR 89.

13

Thus, it is clear that the removal of unauthorised constructions is an object of the 1st

Respondent, and that the legislature has empowered the 1st Respondent to achieve

such object by conferring the 1st Respondent with the power to do so, by way of

Section 6(j). This position is fortified by the provisions of Section 9A(3), which reads

as follows:

(3) Where such owner or occupier or management corporation or other person,

as the case may be:

(a) fails to be present at the inquiry; or

(b) after being present at such inquiry refuses to comply with any direction

issued under subsection (2) within seven days from the date of issue of

such direction,

the Authority shall-

(i) take appropriate measures to demolish such unauthorised

construction;

(ii) direct the discontinuance of the use of the land parcel or building;

(iii) do all such other acts as the owner or occupier or other person was

required to do by such directive under subsection (2).

Thus, it is clear to me that:

(a) The 1st Respondent has a public duty to demolish unauthorised constructions if

the person to whom the direction has been given does not comply with such

direction;

(b) All that the Petitioner is seeking is for the 1st Respondent to exercise its

statutory powers and its public duty, and implement the Order P11 that it has

made.

14

Does the Petitioner have a legal right to the performance of the said legal duty? It is

not in dispute that Condominium Properties have common elements, which are

available for use by all residents of the said Condominium Property, without any

obstruction.9 That is a legal right that every owner and occupier of a condominium

property has been bestowed with. Thus, whenever any owner or occupier of a unit in

such Condominium Property, or for that matter, even the Management Corporation

of such Condominium Property obstructs the common elements, the other owners

as well as the Management Corporation, as the case may be, have a legal right to

have those obstructions to the common elements removed. The detailed procedure

in the Act which I have already discussed has been provided by the legislature to

address this legal right.

It is in the above background that I must consider the position of the 5th Respondent

with regard to the unauthorised constructions that she is said to have carried out. In

paragraph 8 of his first affidavit, the 5A Respondent has stated that, there is no such

construction done by me causing any kind of obstruction to any other occupants of

the condominium property mentioned in the petition. If that be so, the 5th

Respondent ought to have responded to the several notices sent by the 1st

Respondent and satisfied the Inquiry Officer that the complaint of the Petitioner is

baseless.

I have already referred to the several steps that were taken by the 1st Respondent to

ensure the presence of the 5th Respondent, and to the fact that she did not respond

to any of the letters sent to her. Paragraphs 14 22B and 26 of the petition contains

the steps that were taken by the 1st Respondent pursuant to the complaint of the

Petitioner. The response of the 5A Respondent to the said paragraphs is a complete

denial vide paragraph 9 of the affidavit of the 5A Respondent supporting the

averments in his Statement of Objections. In other words, the 5A Respondent has

denied that the 5th Respondent received the correspondence that the 1st Respondent

sent, including the receipt of P11, perhaps forgetting the fact that the 5th

Respondent had replied P11 by letter marked P12.

9 The definition of common element in Section 26 of the Apartment Ownership Law would apply under the Condominium Management Authority Act vide Section 27 of the latter Act.

15

However, by a further affidavit filed thereafter, the 5A Respondent has tendered

letters dated 11th November 2011, 25th November 2011, 2nd December 2011, 8th

January 2012 and 27th January 2012 marked R5e R5i, respectively. The dates of

these letters coincide with some of the letters that were sent by the 1st Respondent

to the 5th Respondent, although the contents are more or less the same. Thus, after

denying the receipt of the said letters in his first affidavit, the 5A Respondent has

changed his position, and admitted that the 5th Respondent received the letters sent

by the 1st Respondent.

However, given the fact that the Inquiry Officer has recorded that the 5th Respondent

has not responded to the letters sent by the 1st Respondent vide P8, P8X, P9

and P10 - I find it difficult to accept the position of the 5A Respondent that the 5th

Respondent sent the letters marked R5e R5i. The result is that the 5th

Respondent as well as the 5A Respondent have lost credibility in the eyes of this

Court. Be that as it may, even if the position in the further affidavit is accepted, it is

clear that the 5th Respondent had avoided participating at the inquiry, and thereby

deprived herself of the opportunity afforded to her by the 1st Respondent of placing

her side of the story.

Even then, the 5A Respondent could have filed at least with his Statement of

Objections, any material including photographs to demonstrate that the 5th

Respondent has not erected any unauthorised structures, nor obstructed the

common elements and that the Inspection Report and the observations of the

Inquiry Officer in 2AR1, are not factually correct. None of this has been done. In my

view, this is critical as the 1st Respondents decision to proceed with an inquiry was

based on the Site Inspection that was carried out by its Assistant General Manager.

Thus, I have no reason to doubt the findings of fact arrived at by the 1st Respondent. I

am therefore satisfied that the factual situation envisaged by the empowering

statute exists in reality and that the Petitioner is entitled to a Writ of Mandamus

directing the 1st Respondent to demolish all unauthorised structures obstructing the

common elements of the said Condominium Property.

I shall now consider the several explanations offered by the 1st Respondent as to why

it did not act at the request of the Petitioner and implement its order, in order to

decide if I should proceed to issue the Writ of Mandamus prayed for.

16

The first is that the Order P11 has been made in June 2012, and that since a

significant period had lapsed by the time the request was made by the Petitioner in

November 2014, it was felt that it would not be prudent to implement its Order. In

other words, the 1st Respondent is claiming that there has been a delay in filing this

application, and for that reason, the writ should be refused. In paragraph 28 of its

petition, the Petitioner has stated that it did make representations to the 1st

Respondent to implement its Order, a position which has been denied by the 1st

Respondent.

In my mind, the fact that the Petitioner did not seek the implementation of the Order

earlier than November 2014 is immaterial, for the reason that the violation is

continuing. What is important is that the 1st Respondent has held that the common

elements have been obstructed by the 5th Respondent in a manner that is contrary to

the Condominium Plan relating to the said premises. If the said obstructions still

exist, which can be ascertained by a site inspection, then, I am of the view that the 1st

Respondent must take steps to implement the provisions of the Act. As already

observed, demolition of unauthorised constructions is one of the objects of the 1st

Respondent, and the legislature has empowered the 1st Respondent to remove any

obstructions to the common elements.

The second ground adduced by the 1st Respondent not to implement its Order is the

underlying tenancy dispute between the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent. Although

the 5A Respondent had not uttered a single word in his affidavit about this dispute,

he has done so in his subsequent affidavit.

In his first complaint to the 1st Respondent marked P5, the Petitioner referred to

the fact that the 5th Respondent is a tenant, and that the 5th Respondent is not

vacating the said premises. P5 was sent by the 1st Respondent to the 5th

Respondent by letter P7, but the 5th Respondent did not respond. In July 2014, the

Petitioner had filed Case No. 15/14 DRE in the District Court, Colombo against the 5th

Respondent, seeking to eject the 5th Respondent from the premises that are the

subject matter of this application.10 I have examined the plaint which has been

produced with the second affidavit of the 5A Respondent marked R5a, and observe 10 The 5th Respondent has been substituted by the 5A and 5B Respondents in the District Court.

17

that the unit in question has been rented out to the 5th Respondent by the

Petitioners predecessor in title, and that the 5th Respondent has not attorned to the

Petitioner, which has resulted in action being filed in the District Court to eject the

5th Respondent from the said unit. What is important to note is that the premises

that have been given on rent to the 5th Respondent is Unit No. 2. An owner cannot

give on rent or lease common elements of a Condominium Property. The complaint

of the Petitioner to the 1st Respondent was with regard to an obstruction by the 5th

Respondent of a common element, which fact has subsequently been confirmed by

the Inspection Report of the 1st Respondent, and the site inspection of the Inquiry

Officer. Thus, it is clear that the Petitioner is not seeking to interfere with the

tenancy rights of the 5th Respondent by complaining to the 1st Respondent. Thus, I

am of the view that the underlying dispute between the Petitioner and the 5th

Respondent is not an impediment to the 1st Respondent implementing its Order.

It would perhaps be appropriate to refer at this stage to the position taken up by the

5th Respondent in R5e R5i that she is unaware of the ownership rights of the

Petitioner to the said Unit, and the reluctance on the part of the 1st Respondent to

implement its Order due to this reason.11 Section 9A(1) does not require the

complaint to be originated by the owner, and makes it clear that the 1st Respondent

can act on a complaint or information received by it of an unauthorized construction.

Thus, the fact that the Petitioner became the owner of the said unit while the 5th

Respondent was the tenant and the fact that the 5th Respondent does not recognise

the Petitioner as the owner is in my view immaterial to the 1st Respondent carrying

out its statutory duty.

Prior to concluding, there are two other matters that I wish to advert to.

In its written submissions, the 1st Respondent has pointed out that the Management

Corporation of the said Condominium Property has the power in terms of Section

20C(2)(f) of the Apartment Ownership Law No. 11 of 1973, as amended, to demolish

unauthorised structures, and that the 1st Respondent can do so, as set out in P11.12

11 Vide paragraph 12(b) and (c) of the Statement of Objections of the 1st Respondent. 12 Section 20C(2)(f) reads as follows: The powers of the management corporation shall include the following (f) to take every steps to prevent and to remove all unauthorized constructions effected to the Condominium Property or Semi Condominium Property in contrary to the approved building plan and to request or assist the

18

In other words, the 1st Respondent is stating that its assistance is not required to

demolish the unauthorised structure. While there is no dispute that the

Management Corporation has the power to do so, that does not take away the public

duty that the 1st Respondent owes the Petitioner to take steps in terms of the Act. In

fact, Section 20C(2)(f) specifically provides that the Management Corporation may

seek the assistance of the 1st Respondent to remove the unauthorised constructions.

Furthermore, I must state that the factual circumstances of this application do not

warrant the Management Corporation taking such steps. I say so for two reasons.

The first is that the entire building is owned by the Petitioner. The second is that the

Management Corporation is controlled by the Directors of the Petitioner. In the

backdrop of the District Court case filed by the Petitioner to eject the 5th

Respondent, I am of the view that this is not a fit situation where the Management

Corporation must demolish the unauthorised structures in terms of Section 20C(2)(f)

of the Apartment Ownership Law.

The second matter that I wish to advert to is the submission of the learned

Presidents Counsel for the 5th, 5A and 5B Respondents that the Condominium Plan

P3 has not been registered. He has referred to the Statement of Objections of the

1st Respondent to support his position. However, what the 1st Respondent has stated

in paragraph 6 of its Statement of Objections is that P3 has not been approved by it

as the 1st Respondent was not in existence in 1973. In fact, the registration of the

Condominium Plan is a matter that has been considered by the Inquiry Officer, as

borne out by the final paragraph in P10,13 and paragraph Nos. 5(10) and (11) of

2AR1.14

Condominium Management Authority or the Urban Development Authority or any local authority to remove such unauthorized constructions. 13 Vide P10 - by; bosrsm;a lrk ,o lreKq wkqj iydOsm;H l<ukdlrk wOsldrsfha ksfhda.h ksl=;a lsrsug lghq;= lrk w;r Bg fmr by; ioyka iydOsm;H m%ldYkfha iy;sl msgm;la fuu wOsldrsh fj; bosrsm;a lrk f,i meusKs,slreg okajhs' 14 Vide 2AR1 fuu mrslaIKfhaos my; ioyka ,sms f,aLk ud jsiska mrslaId lrk ,oS 10' m%isoaO fkd;drsia tus' fkaioqfra jsiska iy;sl l, 1973-12-30 oske;s wxl 109 orK iydOsm;H m%ldYkh 11' by; iydOsm;H msUqr fld<U bXus frPsigd%rA ldrAhd,fha ,shdmosxpS l, njg ,nd.;a A/1/27 orK m;a brefjs iy;sl msgm;la'

19

Thus, the issue of the registration of the Condominium Plan has been considered by

the 1st Respondent, and:

(a) In the absence of any retraction of that position by the 1st Respondent;

(b) The failure by the 5th, 5A and 5B Respondents to support its position with any

material,

I do not see any merit in the said submission of the 5th, 5A and 5B Respondents.

In the above circumstances, I issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent

to act in terms of Section 9A(3), and remove the obstructions placed in the common

elements as referred to in P6, 2AR1 and P11. I make no order with regard to

costs.
