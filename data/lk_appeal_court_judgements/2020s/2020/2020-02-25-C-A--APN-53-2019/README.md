Facts of the Case

The 4'h Accused-Appellant-Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) was

indicted with three other accused under Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code before the High Court of Panadura. The Petitioner and other accused pleaded not guilty to the charge, and thereafter the trial had commenced. At the conclusion of the trial, after considering submissions of all parties made before the Court, the Learned High Court Judge ofPanadura had delivered the Judgment on 14.02.2019, convicting the Petitioner and other three accused under Section 316 of the Penal Code, read with Section 32 of the same. Accordingly, the following sentence had been imposed on the Petitioner and each accused;

I. A term of 05 years rigorous imprisonment,

II. A fine of Rs. 10,000/= with a default sentence of 03 months simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Petitioner had filed an appeal in this Court on 01.03 .2019. Thereafter, the Petitioner had filed a Bail Pending Appeal on 08.03.2019 under Section 20(2) of the Bail Act NO.30 of 1997. The Learned High Court Judge of Panadura had refused the said Bail Pending Appeal Application by order dated 14.03.2019 on the ground of previous convictions and jump bail.

On failing to succeed with the 1st Bail Pending Appeal Application, the Petitioner made the 2nd

Bail Pending Appeal application in the High Court on 29.03.2019. The Learned High Court Judge of Panadura had refused the said 2nd Bail Pending Appeal Application by order dated 29.03.20 19 and thereby the Petitioner has fi led the instant case in this Court.

Grounds of the Revision Application by Petitioner

The Petitioner, in his Petition dated 07.06.2019, has averred that the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Panadura refusing to enlarge the Petitioner on Bail Pending Appeal has erred in law on several grounds, as stated by paragraph 9 of the said Petition as follows;

I. Failed to consider the law relating to Bail Pending Appeal

"

II. Failed to consider the exceptional circumstances averred by the Petitioner

Ill. Failed to consider the substantial miscarriage of justice to the Petitioner

Page 4 of 8

IV. Failed to consider the actual peri09 of imprisonment to be served by the Petitioner in light of the Prison Regulations made under Section 94(1) of the Prison Ordinance

Legal Analysis

I. Failed to consider the law relating to Bail Pending Appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner in his submission before the High Court of Panadura, on 29.03.2019, has submitted the case of Dachchini Vs. Attorney General (2005) 2 SLR 152, in support of his Bail Pending Appeal Application.

In Dachchini V s. Attorney General, it was held that,

" By the enactment oJthe Bail Act the policy in granting bail has undergone a major change. The rule is the grant oj bail. The rule upholds the values endorsed in humanJreedom. The exception is the reJusal oJbail and reasons should be given when reJusing the bail ...

Per SRISKANDARAJAH, J: By the enactment oj the Bail Act there is a major change in the legislative policy and the Courts are bound to give effect to this policy. The High Court Judge in the impugned Order has erred in not taking into consideration the policy changes that has been brought in by the enactment and mechanically applied the principle that the accused have Jailed to show exceptional circumstances when this requirement is no more a principle governing bail pending appeal ... "

However, the contention that was held in the Court of Appeal by Dachchini Vs. Attorney General was overruled by the Supreme Court judgment of Attorney General Vs. Letchchemi & Another (SC Appeal 13/2006) (2006 BLR 16), where it was held that,

" The presumption oj innocence that ensures in Javour oj those suspected or accused or connected with the commission oj an offence, cease to operate after conviction by a court oj competent jurisdiction."

[t was further held that,

"Bail after conviction in the High Court reJerred to in Section 333(3) oJ the Code oj Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 oJ1979 has been incorporated in verbatim in Section 20(2) oj the Bail Act

Page 5 of 8

No. 30 of 1997. The sellied law on this is that wfzere a section has been incorporated in verbatim, governing principles applicable are those contained in the principle enactment. The interpretation of the principle enactment has always held that there must be exceptional circumstances.

As section 20 of the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997 is identical to that contained in the Code of Crimina I Procedure, in its implementation the earlier restricted view of the convicted person having to disclose exceptional circumstances for grant of bail must prevail ... "

Thus, it is a proven fact that exceptional circumstances must prevail to grant bail for a convicted person. Therefore the Petitioner should prove exceptional circumstances.

ii. Failed to consider the exceptional circumstances averred bv the Petitioner.

As it was stated in Javanthi Silva and Two Others Vs. Attorney General (1997) 3 SLR 11 7, by D.P.S.Gunasekera J.,

"Over the years a principle has evolved through judicial decisions that bail pending appeal from convictions by the Supreme Court would only be granted in exceptional circumstances."

This fact has been held in many other judicial presidents such as Attorney General Vs. Ediriweera (SC Appeal No. 100/2005) (2006 BLR 12), where it was held that,

"The norm is that bail ajier conviclion is not a mailer of right but would be granted only under exceptional circumstances."

Further, in the case ofMuthuretty Vs. The Oueen (54 NLR 493), it was held that,

"That in bail pending appeal, Court will not grant bail as a rule, bail granted only in exceptional circumstances .. . "

.. As exceptional circumstances the Learned Counsel has submitted that the Petitioner is a married man with children and the Petitioner is unable to support the family.

The grounds submitted by the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner to the fact that his wife and children would be destitute if the Petitioner is not at the matrimonial house, does not amount to an "exceptional circumstance". This aspect was considered by L.T.B.Dehideniya J. Ranil Charuka Kulathunga Vs. Attorney General (CA [PHC] APN 134/2015).

Page 6 of 8

"The Petitioner submits several grounds as exceptionpl grounds to consider bail. The Petitioner states that he is a married person with two school going children. A person gelling married and having children is not an exceptional ground. It is the normal day to day life of the people. "

III. Failed to consider the substantial miscarriage of justice to the Petitioner.

Though it is submitted that there is a miscarriage of justice the counsel is unable to support his versIon.

[n the case of .Iayanthi Silva and Two Others Vs. Attorney General (1997) 3 SLR 1[ 7,

"The appellate court would interfere where a Judge has given weight to considerations which are irrelevant or taken into account extraneous considerations in exerCising his discretion which would amount to an abuse of the discretion vested to act judicially. "

Therefore it is evident that the law relating to bail pending appeal had been correctly applied by the Learned High Court Judge and it is only at the absence of any exceptional circumstances as it has been est:lblished by legal principles over years, that the Learned High Court Judge had refused the Application on bail pending appeal.

[n the instant case, the Judge has acted judicially.

Having made a Revision Application to this Court, the Petitioner has to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court, which is to be exercised only under exceptional circumstances.

In Attorney General Vs. Gunawardena (1996) 2 SLR 149 it was held that,

"Revision like an appeal is directed towards the correction of errors but it is supervisory in

nature and its object is the due administration of justice and not primarily or solely the relieving of grievances of a party ... "

Further in the case of Bank of Ceylon Vs. Kaleel and Others (2004) ISLR 284, as it was held by

Wimalachandra, J.

"In any event to exercise revisionary jurisdiction the order challenged must have occasioned a failure of justice and be manifesily erroneous which go beyond an error or defect or irregularity

that an ordinary person would instanily react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked the conscience of court."

Page 7 of 8

iv. Failed to consider the actual period of imprisonment to be served by the Petitioner in light of the Prison Regulations made under Section 94(1) of the Prison Ordinance.

The Learned High Court Judge has considered the previous conduct and the behavior of the

Petitioner himself, where according to his counsel in the High Court submitted (at page 41 of the High Court Brief) that the Petitioner had forgotten to appear in Courts in few occasions.

Though the sentence is not above 5 years, there is a likelihood of the Petitioner to jump bail if granted and therefore there is no failure of justice in the order of the Learned High Court Judge.

[ am of the view that the Petitioner had failed to demonstrate exceptional circumstances to the satisfaction of this Court in order to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction. Considering above, [ see no reason to revise the Order of the Learned High Court Judge of Panadura.

Therefore this revision application is dismissed without costs.

K. Priyantha Fernando, J.

I agree.
