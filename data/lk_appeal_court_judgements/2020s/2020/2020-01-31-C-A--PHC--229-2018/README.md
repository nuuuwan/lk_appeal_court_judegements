The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) is before

this Court seeking to set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge of the

Western Province holden in Colombo dated 28/09/2018.

The Appellant was the manager of the I st Respondent Co-operative Society

at all times material to this action. On 03/03/2011 , the 1st Respondent sent a letter

demand to the Appellant to recover a sum of Rs. 12,337,222.92 (Vide page 402 of

the brief) alleged to have been misappropriated. The Appellant admitted liability,

to re-pay a part of the said amount. Since the amount to be recovered was not

settled in full, the 1 st Respondent referred the dispute to the 2nd Respondent in

terms of Section 58(1) of the Co-operative Societies Law NO.5 of 1972, and upon

receipt was referred to the 3rd Respondent, Arbitrator. On 2611212011, the

Arbitrator made award that the Appellant is liable to pay a sum of Rs.

10,185,842.83. The Appellant thereafter sought to quash the arbitral award and the

initial order made by the 1 st Respondent by invoking the writ jurisdiction of the

High Court of the Western Province. It is against that order that the Appellant has

filed the instant application.

Section 58 of the Co-operative Societies Law reads as follows: -

(1) (e) ----

A claim by a registered society for any debt. demand or damages due to it from a

member. officer or employee. whether past or present, or any nominee. heir or

legal representative of a deceased member, officer or employee. whether such

debt, demand or damages be admitted or not. shall be deemed to be a dispute

touching the business of the society within the meaning of this subsection.

(2) The Registrar may, on receipt of a reference under subsection (1)-

(a) decide the dispute himself, or

(b) refer it for disposal to an arbitrator or arbitrators.

(3) Any party aggrieved by the award of the arbitrator or arbitrators may appeal

therefrom to the Registrar within such period and in such manner as may be

prescribed by rules.

(4) No party to any appeal made to the Registrar under subsection (3) shall be

entitled, either by himself or by any representative, to appear before and be

heard by the Registrar on such appeal.

(5) A decision of the Registrar under subsection (2) or in appeal under

subsection (3) shall be final and shall not be called in question in any civil

court.

The Appellant in this application has challenged the order of the learned

High Court Judge primarily on the following grounds.

1. The arbitrator is not properly appointed.

2. No charge sheet or charges issued against the Petitioner.

3. The order dated 26112/2011 , made by the arbitrator marked 'P4', is per se

erroneous and it violates the rules of natural justice.

It is observed that prior to the commencement of the arbitration inquiry

proceedings as reflected in document marked 'P2', (Vide page 122 of the brief)

the Appellant on various instances prior to the commencement and at the time the

arbitral proceedings were ongoing has accepted liability to pay the total amount

misappropriated. One such instance was by letter dated 08/0912010, addressed to

the I st Respondent where the Appellant stated;

Similar assurances were given by the Appellant to the I st Respondent by

documents marked 'lVT, 'lV8', 'lV9' and 'IV21'.

When this matter was taken up for argument, the Counsel for the Appellant

contended that the facts led in evidence at the inquiry are not disputed. However,

the Appellant has challenged the mandate given to the arbitrator marked '2VI', on

the basis that there is no reference to a number or the date of the gazette

notification pertaining to the appointment of Arbitrator. The Appellant has also

challenged document marked' 2V2', on the basis that the said document does not

state any charge leveled against the Appellant nor has it directed the Appellant to

be present at the arbitral proceedings.

It is very clear by document marked '2V 1', (Vide page 453 of the brief) the

3rd Respondent commenced arbitration proceedings on 06/07/20 II, through a valid

Page 5 of 9

mandate (Vide page 112 of the brief). Prior to the commencement of the

proceedings the arbitrator has clearly set out the legislative provisions and the

rules and procedure applicable to the arbitration. It is also observed that, on the

date of commencement of proceedings the legal representative for the 1st

Respondent, in the presence of the Appellant and with the approval of the

arbitrator, suggested and carried out amendments to certain documents and

statement of accounts tendered by the 1 st Respondent. It is also observed that prior

to the commencement of the inquiry on 03/09/2011, the Appellant was made fully

aware of the charges against her (Vide page 119 of the brief). I also observe that

the impugned award comprehensively deals with evidence and the documents

submitted before the inquiry. Therefore, the objections raised by the Appellant is

devoid of any merit.

In Nagalingam Vs. Luxman de Mel 78 NLR 231 at page 238, Justice

Sharvananda, (as he then was) cited with approval, "where nothing more is

involved than a mere irregularity of procedure, or (e.g.) non-compliance with

statutory conditions precedent to the validity of a step in the litigation of such a

character that if one of the parties be allowed to waive the defect, or by conduct or

inaction to be estopped from setting it up, no new jurisdiction is thereby impliedly

created and no existing jurisdiction impliedly extended beyond its existing

boundaries, the estoppel will be maintained and the affirmative answer of

illegality will fail ". (Spencer Bower- Estoppel by Representation (2nd Ed.),

Section 142 at page 136).

It is noted that, at no time 0 f the proceedings had the Appellant raised

objection to the appointment of the arbitrator or to the alleged failure to present a

charge sheet. To the contrary, the appellant conceded to all the charges brought

against her and consented to pay in full the amount due. It is also noted that on

06/07/20 II , the Appellant consented to the commencement of the arbitration

inquiry before the arbitrator. No objection was raised regarding the mandate given

to the arbitrator or to any irregularity in the service of summons on the Appellant

during the said proceedings. Therefore, I do not see any illegality in the decision

made by the Arbitrator. It is settled law that a Court exercising judicial review

does not concern itself with the correctness of the decision but only with its

lawfulness (Nicholas Vs. Macan Markar Limited (1985) 1 SLR 130). In the

circumstances, I reject the argument of the learned Counsel on issues No. I and 2.

In Nagalingam Vs. Luxman de Mel 78NLR 231, (supra) an application

was made for a writ of certiorari to quash the order of the Commissioner of

Labour inter-alia, on the basis that the 1 SI Respondent had admittedly made the

said order after the expiry of 3 months from the date of the receipt of the

application and that the order was in breach of the provisions of the Act, hence its

ultra vires the powers of the Commissioner of Labour and therefore, null and void.

Justice Sharvananda, remarked thus;

"Further the Petitioner, having participated in the proceeding without any

objection and having taken the chance of the final outcome of the proceedings, is

precluded from raising any objection to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of

labour to make a valid order after the zero hour. The jurisdictional defect, if any,

has been cured by the petitioner's consent and acquiescence. "

His Lordship also cited the case of Alagappa Chitty Vs. Arumugam Chitty

(2 c.L. Rep.202), where it was held that;

"Where jurisdiction over the subject matter exists requiring only to be invoked in

the right way, the party who has invited or allowed the court to exercise it in a

wrong way cannot after wards turn round to challenge the legality of proceedings

due to his own invitation or negligence"

Therefore, in any event the Appellant is now precluded from raising any of

the above objections since "the right to impugn the proceedings has been lost by

his acquiescence ".

The learned Counsel for the Appellant supports issue No.3 on the basis that

the learned High Court Judge has in his order failed to "distinguish the nature of

an appeal and a writ application ". It is trite law that the merits of the findings will

not be subject to review by way of certiorari. Instead the interest would be

whether the decision is lawful or not. On the said premise, the learned Counsel for

the Appellant submits that "judicial review is concerned not with the decision but

the decision-making process ". The Appellant's contention on the procedural

irregularity, illegality and! or irrationality attributable to issues No.1 and 2, above,

was dealt with and rejected. In any event, I do not encounter any illegality,

impropriety and! or irrationality in the purported order given by the learned High

Court Judge.

For all the reasons stated above, I see no reason to interfere with the

decision of the learned High Court Judge and accordingly, the application of the

Appellant is dismissed.

Parties in CA(PHC)APN-15/2019 have agreed to abide by the order

delivered in this case.

Application dismissed.
