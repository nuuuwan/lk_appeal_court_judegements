Respondent.

21.09.2020.

a motion dated 14.09.2020 the learned Additional

Solicitor General brings to the notice of this Court that the Petitioner has

been informed, through an advertisement by the 1 st Respondent published

in the Dinamina newspaper dated 12. 08. 2020, of an election for the post

of Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Maha Katharagama Devalaya to be

held on 22. 09. 2020.

The Petitioner has also attached to his motion a letter marked as X4

dated 25.06.2020, where the office of Basnayake Nilames has been

extended for further period of one year. The motion dated 14. 09. 2020

states that in the same may as the post of Basnayake Nilame of other

devalaya has been extended, the Petitioner too should be extended in his

office.

This motion was supported before this Court and the learned Additional

Solicitor General assisted this Court in the consideration of this matter.

The arguments of the both counsel were heard in this matter.

We take the view that the Petitioner could not be extended in the office of

Basnayake Nilame as X4 does not give extension to Basnayake Nilames

whose services were suspended during a periJd of 5 years. In the

circumstances, we hold that X4 does not apply to the Petitioner in this

case.

The second matter that was agitated before us is the imminent

election to the Ruhunu Maha Katharagama Devalaya to be held on

22.09.2020. In the course of the argument today before this Court the

eligibility of the Petitioner to contest the election came up for review as he

sought a stay of the election fIxed for 22.09.2020.

The learned Additional Solicitor General brings to the notice of this

Court Section 12 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance No: 19 of

1931 as amended. We have given our earnest consideration to the

Provisions of Section 12 to ascertain whether the Petitioner suffers from

any disqualifIcation to contest the election fIxed for 22.09.2020. This issue

arose because of the plea for a stay order to stay the elections. It is in

those circumstances that this Court examined the Provisions of Section

12 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance. It is an admitted fact that

the Petitioner was appointed as the Busnayake Nilame of the Devalaya on

28.04.2015. His suspension took place on 09.04.2018. This Petitioner

challenged this suspension by way of writ application bearing No:

171/2018 as pleaded as P20 and this Court as far back as 18.05.2018

refused to issue notice in the matter.

The learned Additional Solicitor General brings to the notice of this

Court all the relevant documentation with reference to this application. If

not for this suspension which took place on 09.04.2018 this Petitioner

would have held office for a period of 5 years till 27.04.2020.

We have examined the provisions of Section 12 of the Buddhist

Temporalities Ordinance No: 19 of 1931 and we are of the considered

view the suspension would have operated only till 27.04.2020 as both the

Sinhala and English versions of the legislation makes it patently clear that

the suspension could be operative only during the period of an office of

the Busnayake Nilame. We take the view this suspension would have

lapsed by 27.04.2020 and there is no extension of this suspension by any

Court. Only if this suspension continues beyond 27.04.2020 we take the

view that section 12 would operate to disqualify this petitioner from

standing for election to the office of Basnayake Nimale. However we do

note that this petitioner faces a charge sheet which remains stayed by

this Court. There is no disqualification for a person who is charged with or

whose charge has been stayed, to stand for election to contest the office of

Basnayake Nimale of the Devalaya. We engage in this interpretation of

Section 12 because arguments were addressed to this Court by both

President's Counsel on the interpretation of Section 12. In the best

traditions of the Attorney-General's office the learned Additional Solicitor

General states that if this Court comes to the view that the Petitioner is not

disqualified from standing for elections he could do so and proceed to

5

contest the elections. We are of the unanimous view that the Petitioner

suffers no impediment to contest this election which is fIxed for

22.09.2020.

The Legal officer Ms. Priyanthi Weerasinghe to the office of the

Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs is present in Court and taken

note of this order.

A Copy of this order is made available to the Petitioner and the

counsel for the State.
