The Petitioner owns one half of a land in extent of 2.2SP situated in

Mahabuthgamuwa within the Kotikawatte -Mulleriyawa Pradeshiya Sabha

area. The Petitioner states that he is carrying on a business of manufacturing

rubber bushes, beadings and packing under the name of 'Sarath Rubber

Industries' at the said premises. 1

The Petitioner states further that proceedings in terms of the Land Acquisition

Act, as amended (the Act) to acquire the said land for the purpose of road

expansion and development work, commenced in 2012 and that the Minister

has made an Order under proviso (a) to Section 38 of the Act to take over

immediate possession of the said land.2 It does not appear that the Petitioner

had any objection to the said acquisition, even though he had to relocate his

business premises. The Petitioner had accordingly submitted a claim for

compensation, and had participated at the inquiry held in terms of Section 9(1)

of the Act to determine the said claim.

Part VI of the Act and in particular Sections 45 and 46, contain provisions

relating to the assessment of compensation.

The relevant parts of Section 46 (1) are re-produced below:

"The amount of compensation to be paid under this Act to any person

interested in a land shall-

(a) where the compensation is for the acquisition of that land, be based

on the market value of that land, or ....

and shall be proportionate to his interest in that land. No additional

compensation shall be allowed to him in consideration of the compulsory

nature of the acquisition, but, where it is the land which is to be acquired,

he shall be entitled to:

(iii) compensation for any such loss of earnings from any business carried

on the land on the aforesaid date as may be caused by the

acquisition of the land

Provided that

(b) the amount of the compensation under paragraph (iii) of this

subsection shall not exceed three times the average annual net

profits from the business, as shown by the books of accounts, for the

three calendar years immediately preceding the date on which the

notice under section 7 in respect of the land is published in the

Gazette; and ... "

The relevant parts of Section 45 (1) are re-produced below:

"For the purpases of this Act the market value of a land in respect of which

a notice under section 7 has been published shall, subject as hereinafter

provided, be the amount which the land might be expected to have

realised if sold by a willing seller in the open market as a separate entity

on the date of publication of that notice in the Gazette, .... "

The Petitioner states that the Acquiring Officer published his award under

Section 17(1) of the Act on 24th November 2015. In terms of the said award,

annexed to the petition marked 'PS', the Petitioner had been awarded a sum

of Rs. 560,000 as compensation for his one half share of 2.25P. The Petitioner

states that the Acquiring Officer failed to take into consideration inter alia his

loss of earnings from his business, and therefore he filed an appeal with the

Board of Review, as provided for in Section 21 of the Act. This is the remedy

provided by the legislature to any person dissatisfied by an award made under

Section 17(1). In the said appeal annexed to the petition marked 'P6', the

Petitioner had brought to the attention of the Board of Review, inter alia that

he has taken loans from banks in a sum of Rs. 3 million, and that the value of

his machinery exceeds Rs. 10 million, and claimed an enhancement of

compensation in a sum of Rs. 40 million. The appeal filed by the Petitioner is

pending before the Board of Review. This Court must observe that the

legislature has provided a person dissatisfied with the decision of the Board of

4

Review with a further right of appeal to this Court in terms of Section 28, on a

question of law.

In order to afford relief expeditiously to persons whose lands have been

acquired and thereby expedite the acquisition process, the Government has

established a Land Acquisition Review Committee, commonly referred to as

the 'LARC' and an appellate body known as the 'Super LARC'. By a letter dated

2Sth June 2018 annexed to the petition marked 'P7', the Petitioner had been

informed by the 2

nd Respondent that the claim of the Petitioner had been

considered by the 'LARC' and the 'Super LARC', and that the compensation

payable to the Petitioner had been enhanced by a sum of Rs. 496,703.

Together with interest, the Petitioner was entitled to receive a sum of Rs.

1,226,047 as compensation for the acquisition of his one half share of 2.2SP.

As the Petitioner continued to be dissatisfied with the quantum of

compensation awarded to him, he had made further representations to the 1st

Respondent, which resulted in the 2nd Respondent, the Acquiring Officer for

the Colombo District, making a request to the Chief Valuer to consider if the

compensation due to the Petitioner on account of loss of business can be

enhanced.3 The learned State Counsel has produced the reply sent by the Chief

Valuer, wherein he has stated that:

The Petitioner has not handed over the premises in spite of several notices

being served on him5, as a result of which the Respondents have filed action in

the Magistrate's Court of Colombo in terms of Section 42(2) of the Act6, and

obtained a Writ of execution to eject the Petitioner from the said land 7

Being dissatisfied with the aforementioned Order of the learned Magistrate,

the Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

(a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision reflected in the letters marked

'P12', 'P12a' and 'P12b' to take over possession of the land belonging to

the Petitioner;

(b) A Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st and 2nd Respondents from taking

possession until a proper valuation is done.

The learned State Counsel appearing for the Respondents submitted that the

land of the Petitioner, together with several other lands, is required for the

Ambathale Road widening Project, which is funded by the Organisation of

Petrol Exporting Countries (OPEC). She submitted that the acquisition process

commenced way back in 2013, and that while the 1st Respondent has taken

possession of all other lands required for the Project, the Petitioner's land is

the only land that remains to be taken over by the 1st Respondent. She

s The following notices have been served on the Petitioner:

(a) Letter dated 7'" February 2014 marked 'P12b'; (b) Letter dated 13'" July 2018 marked 'P12'; (c) Letter dated 23'd May 2019 marked 'P12a'.

6 Section 42(2) reads as follows: "Where any officer directed by an Order under section 38 to take possession of any land is unable or apprehends that he will be unable to take possession of that land because of any obstruction or resistance which has been or is likely to be offered, such officer shall, on his making an application in that behalf to the Magistrate's Court having jurisdiction over the place where that land is situated, be entitled to an order of that court directing the Fiscal to deliver possession of that land to him for and on behalf of the State "

7 The nature of an application under Section 42(2) has been discussed in Mohammed Lebbe vs Madana [66 NLR 239).

submitted further that the Project is due for completion by end December

2019 and that possession of the land currently occupied by the Petitioner is

required on an urgent basis, as it is preventing the successful completion of the

Project. The Petitioner has not disputed any of these facts.

The principal submission of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

Petitioner has not refused to hand over possession of the land but that he must

be paid reasonable compensation, if he is to vacate the said land. This Court

observes that the conduct of the Petitioner however amounts to a refusal to

handover the property in issue to the State. The question that this Court must

therefore consider is whether payment of compensation that is acceptable to

the Petitioner is a condition precedent to the handing over of possession of the

land owned and possessed by the Petitioner.

Part V of the Act contains provisions dealing with taking over possession of a

land. Section 38 of the Act reads as follows:

"At any time after an award is made under Secti,on 17, the Minister may

by Order published in the Gazette -

(a) Where the award relates to the acquisition of any land, direct the

acquiring officer ... to take possession of that land for and on behalf

of the State ... "

Thus, in terms of Section 38(a), possession can be taken over any time after an

award is made under Section 17. There is no requirement that the State must

await the outcome of the appeal that a party may' make against the said

award. This Court is therefore of the view that the Minister is entitled to make

7

Website Copy Website Copy

an order that possession be taken over, soon after an award is made under

Section 17(1), pending the outcome of an appeal to the Board of Review.

The Act has provided the State with an accelerated procedure for the taking

over of possession of any land that is the subject of an acquisition under the

Act. In terms of proviso (a) of Section 38 of the Act, the Minister may make an

Order to take possession of the land that is the subject matter of an

acquisition, where it becomes necessary to take immediate possession of any

land on the ground of any urgency, after a notice under either Section 2 or 4

has been exhibited. Where an Order is so made, the Acquiring Officer need not

await an award under Section 17(1) to take over possession of the land.

The Order made by the Minister under proviso (a) of Section 38 in respect of

the Petitioner's land has been annexed to the petition marked 'P3'. The

material that has been placed before this Court by the Respondents amply

demonstrates the urgent need to take over immediate possession of the land

belonging to the Petitioner. In fact, the Petitioner is not alleging that there is

no urgency in taking over possession. The only argument of the Petitioner is

that the compensation is inadequate.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the Respondent is entitled

to take possession of the Petitioner's land, any time after an Order is made in

terms of proviso (a) of Section 38. The fact that an award under Section 17(1)

has not been made or where an award has been made the fact that the

Petitioner has filed an appeal against such award or that compensation has not

been paid is irrelevant in terms of the Act, when it comes to taking over of

possession of the land. The payment of compensation and/or a final

determination by the Board of Review or by this Court with regard to the

8

Website Copy Website Copy

entitlement and/or the quantum of compensation are not conditions

precedent to the taking over of possession. In these circumstances, this Court

does not see any merit in the submission of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner that the Petitioner is not required to hand over possession until a

final determination is made with regard to compensation or until he is paid

reasonable compensation.

There is one other matter that this Court wishes to advert to. This Court

observes that the initial quantum of compensation offered to the Petitioner

was a sum of Rs. 560,000. According to the minutes of the meeting that the

'Super LARC' had with the Petitioner, annexed to the counter affidavit of the

Petitioner marked 'PI0(viiil', the Petitioner had agreed to the following course

of action:

"2005, 2006, 2007 ~ eJ@D ffld~ ffi~ eJJdOlJ @(gOOt e&l ~~

The Petitioner had annexed to the petition the Statements of Account for the

years 2005-06 and 2006-07 submitted by him to the 'Super LARC', marked

'PI0(jx)' and 'PI0(x)'. This Court has examined same and observes that while

the total revenue of the Petitioner for the said years was Rs. 1,736,113/- and

1,786,703/-, his annual profit for each of the said years had only been Rs.

353,785/- and 360,172/-. This Court is at a loss to understand the reason to call

for the accounts of 2006 and 2007 when the acquisition had commenced in

2012. Be that as it may, the Petitioner has not complained of this fact nor has

9

Website Copy Website Copy

the Petitioner placed before this Court the statements of account for the

subsequent years to demonstrate that his revenue and/or profit was higher

than what the 'Super LARC' considered. The fact that the 'Super LARC' has

increased the quantum of compensation by Rs. 496,703 demonstrates that the

reasons urged by the Petitioner for an enhancement of the compensation has

been given due consideration. The said enhancement is in fact in excess of the

quantum provided by Regulation 4(2)(g) of the Land Acquisition (Payment of

Compensation) Regulations, 20138 and is within the quantum of compensation

provided for in Section 46 of the Act, for loss of earnings.

The Petitioner has annexed to the petition marked 'P9(b)' -'P9(e)'

photographs depicting his business establishment. This Court has examined

the said photographs and observes that the machinery and equipment of the

Petitioner can be re-Iocated without any difficulty. The Petitioner has also

annexed to the petition marked 'Pl0(j)' - 'Pl0livl', several letters issued by

banks to support his position that he has taken loans for his business. This

Court has examined the said documents and observes that each of the loans

referred to in the said letters have been obtained by the Petitioner after the

acquisition process commenced. In the said circumstances, it appears to this

Court that the Respondents have acted reasonably in determining the

compensation payable to the Petitioner. This finding shall not prevent the

Board of Review from considering the matters urged before it by the

Petitioner, including any documents to substantiate his revenue and profits for

the relevant period, and arriving at a decision in terms of the law.

In the above circumstances:

(a) This Court does not see any legal basis to issue formal notice of this

application on the Respondents:

(b) This Court directs the Respondents to pay the Petitioner the

compensation awarded by 'Super LARC' within a period of eight weeks

from the taking over of possession of the said land.

Subject to the above direction, this application is dismissed, without costs.
