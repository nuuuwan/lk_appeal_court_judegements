Janak De Silva J.

The 4th Respondent was the General Manager/Director of the Petitioner. He was employed by

the Petitioner from 06th May 2006 to 31st July 2015. The 4th Respondent by letter P3

complained to the 2nd Respondent that the Petitioner had failed to pay Employees Provident

Fund (EPF) and Employees Trust Fund (ETF) dues to the 4th Respondent for the period of

employment of 9 years and 2 months. The 3rd Respondent by letter dated 19.08.2015 (P2)

informed the Petitioner that an inquiry will be held into the said complaint. Both the Petitioner

and 4thRespondent took part in the said inquiry.

By letter dated 27.08.2016 (R1/P8), the 2nd Respondent informed the Petitioner that after

considering the material submitted by Petitioner at the said inquiry, it is established that there

was an employer-employee relationship between the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent and as

such the Petitioner is liable to pay the EPF in terms of the Employees Provident Fund Act No. 15

of 1958 as amended (Act).

The 2nd Respondent by notice dated 28.12.2016 (P9) informed the Petitioner of the

computation. The 1st Respondent issued a final notice dated 02.02.2017 (P11) informing the

Petitioner that legal action will be taken if payment of the overdue EPF is not made. Therefore,

proceedings were instituted in the Magistrates Court of Panadura Case No. 45213 to recover

the moneys in default.

The Petitioner has sought the following relief

a) A writ of certiorari quashing the purported determination of the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd

Respondents that the 4th Respondent was an employee of the Petitioner and/or that

the Petitioner is liable to pay EPF and surcharge in respect of the 4th Respondent;

Page 3 of 6

b) A writ of certiorari quashing the purported notices marked P8, P9 and P11 with the

petition;

c) A writ of prohibition prohibiting the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rd and/or 4th Respondent

from taking any steps towards prosecuting the Petitioner and/or otherwise in

furtherance of the notices marked P8 and/or P9 and/or P11 with the petition.

The principal submission of the Petitioner is that the 1st to 3rd Respondents have misdirected

themselves by addressing the questions of whether there was an employee-employer relation

between parties when that was an admitted fact and the only issue to be decided was whether

the amount paid to the 4th Respondent were paid in respect of his employment or whether it

was paid as a Directors Fee in respect of his role as a Director of the Petitioner.

In spite of this stated position, at paragraph 25 of the petition, the Petitioner has sought a writ

of certiorari to quash the determination that the 4th Respondent was an employee of the

Petitioner. Accordingly, I will first consider whether there is any error in this conclusion.

There can be no doubt that a person can be both a director and an employee of a company at

the same time.

In Lee v. Lees Air Farming Ltd [(1960) 3 All ER 420 at 425}, Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest held:

It is well established that the mere fact that someone is a director of a company is no

impediment to his entering into a contract to serve the company Nor in their

Lordships view were any contractual obligation invalidated by the circumstances that

the deceased was sole governing director in whom was vested the full government and

control of the respondent company.

This approach was applied in Collettes Ltd v. Commissioner of Labour and Others [(1986) 2

Sri.L.R. 6] where it was held that a Managing Director has a dual capacity of being an employee

of the company and also at the same time takes part in the management of the company. It was

further held that the fact that as Managing Director or as Group Managing Director, he takes

part in the management of the affairs of the company does not deprive him of his other

capacity as an employee of the said company. In that case, it was held that the 4th Respondent

falls within the definition of a workman in the Act.

The Petitioner in this case concedes that the 4th Respondent functioned in a dual capacity as an

employee and Director but contends that he was paid only for his role as a Director. According

to the Petitioner, it is this issue that has not been addressed by P8/R1.

Page 4 of 6

In letter dated 27.08.2016 (P8/R1), the 2nd Respondent states that the available material

establishes that there was an employer-employee relationship between the Petitioner and 4th

Respondent within the meaning of the Act. In terms of section 47 of the Act, employee

includes any apprentice or learner who is paid a remuneration. Accordingly, the payment of a

remuneration is an essential condition to the existence of an employer-employee relation

within the meaning of the Act. When the 2nd Respondent held that there was an employer-

employee relationship between the Petitioner and the 4th Respondent within the meaning of

the Act, it necessarily means that consideration was given to the issue of whether the 4th

Respondent was paid in respect of his employment and an affirmative finding made.

This conclusion is supported by evidence led at the inquiry. In terms of section 47 of the Act,

earnings means inter alia wages, salary or fees. The contribution that must be made under

the Act as EPF according to the section 10 of the Act is based on earnings.

The pay slips of the Petitioner marked X14 and X15 and annexed to the written submissions of

the 4th Respondent made before the Labour Department shows that the 4th Respondent was

paid a salary. The salary slip X15 also shows that no EPF was paid by the Petitioner with regard

to the 4th Respondents salary. Documents annexed to the Petitioners written submissions (P6)

marked X16(a) to X16(e) made before the Labour Department show that the 4th Respondent

was paid a salary by the Petitioner.

The true grievance of the Petitioner appears to be that there was an agreement between the 4th

Respondent and the Petitioner that the 4th Respondent would not be paid EPF (X10 & P5).

However, the Supreme Court in Blanka Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd v. Van Els [(2004) 3 Sri.L.R. 314] held

that there can be no waiver of contribution by agreement between employer and employee as

section 16(1) of the Act provides that the employer of every employee to whom this Act

applies shall, inrespect of each month during which such employee is employed by such

employer, be liable to pay in respect of such employee, to the fund, on or before the last day of

the succeeding month, a contribution of an amount equal to 3 per centum of the total earnings

of such employee from his employment under such employer during that month.

The principle was followed by this Court in Ceylon Agro Industries Limited v. Employees Trust

Fund [C.A. (PHC) 40/2003; C.A.M. 26.02.2016]. Therefore, I have no hesitation in rejecting the

submissions of the Petitioner that the 4th Respondent is bound by the terms of the said

agreement.

Page 5 of 6

As an extension of this submission, the Petitioner contends that the 4th Respondent is seeking

to Quod approbo non reprobo (approbate and reprobate) which should not be allowed. In

support of this position, the Petitioner has cited the decision in Ceylon Plywoods Corporation v.

Samastha Lanka G.N.S.M.& Rajya Sanstha Sevaka Sangamaya [(1992) 1 Sri.L.R. 157] where S. N.

Silva, J. (as he was then) held that the doctrine of approbate and reprobate (quod approbo non

reprobo) is based on the principle that no person can accept and reject the same instrument.

However, in this case, Court is confronted with an agreement between parties dealing with

waiver of EPF benefit which is not valid according to the law. Hence, the principle of approbate

and reprobate has no application to the instant case.

The Petitioner further submits that the claim of the 4thRespondent amounts to unjust

enrichment in view of the contractual agreement between parties. In my view, this submission

is erroneous in law as the 4th Respondent is claiming his statutory entitlements and in such the

question of unjust enrichment is irrelevant.

The Petitioner further submits that the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 3rdRespondents have failed to

provide reasons for the decision in P8. Reliance was placed on Unique Gem Stones Ltd v. W.

Karunadasa and Others [(1996) 2 Sri.L.R. 357], Kegalle Plantations Ltd v. Silva and Others

[(1996) 2 Sri.L.R. 180], Karunadasa v. Unique Gem Stones Ltd and Others [(1997) 1 Sri.L.R. 256]

and Kusumawathie and Others v. Aitken Spence & Co. Ltd. and Another [(1996) 2 Sri.L.R. 18].

However, the Respondents point out these authorities did not lay down that there was a

general principle that there is a right to reasons. While reserving my position on the need to

give reasons, it is observed that the 1st 3rd Respondents have in their objections given reasons

for the decision contained in P8.

Finally, there is also the question of delay. P8 is dated 27.08.2016 while this application was

filed on 20.06.2017 nearly 10 months after the decision.

In Biso Menike v. Cyril De Alwis and Others [(1982) 1 Sri.L.R. 368 at 379] it was held that an

application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within a reasonable time from the date of the

Order which the applicant seeks to have quashed. What is reasonable time and what will

constitute undue delay will depend upon the facts of each particular case. However, the time

lag that can be explained does not spell laches or delay. If the delay can be reasonably

explained, the Court will not decline to interfere. The delay which a Court can excuse is one

which is caused by the applicant pursuing a legal remedy and not a remedy which is extra-legal.

One satisfactory way to explain the delay is for the petitioner to show that he has been seeking

relief elsewhere in a manner provided by the Law.

In this case, the Petitioner did not resort to any legal remedies prior to the institution of this

application. The first communication after the receipt of P8 is letter dated 05.01.2017 [P12(a)]

by which a request was made for certified copies of the inquiry proceedings. The minute

thereon marked P12(a) indicates that the Personal Manager Noel Fernando was informed that

the request can be granted only upon a court order. This was conveyed to the Petitioners

lawyer. It is only after the Petitioner received summons to be present in the Magistrates Court

on 27.07.2019 was this application filed. I hold that there has been an undue delay in the

circumstance of the case.

For all the foregoing reasons, this application is dismissed without costs.
