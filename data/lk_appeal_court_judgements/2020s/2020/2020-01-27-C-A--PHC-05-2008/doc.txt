A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

In this application, the Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) seeks to set aside the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of the

Eastern Province holden in Trincomalee, rejecting the issue of an order in the

nature of writ of certiorari to quash a determination given by the 1 st Respondent

affirming the Arbitration award (T.D/99/43), and also to quash the said Arbitration

award made in terms of Section 58(1) of the Co-operative Societies Law No.5 of

1972 (as amended). The dispute arising as a result of a short fall in stored paddy

stocks in the wholesale storage facility from 25/0211998 to 2110111999 referred to

Arbitration by the 2nd Respondent was attributed to the Appellant who was the

manager of the facility. At the conclusion of inquiry, the Arbitrator by award dated

27/0112001, held that the Appellant was liable to pay a sum of Rupees 484, 617/44

for the loss of paddy stocks.

The Appellant has preferred this application on the basis that;

the arbitrator has failed to give due consideration to the weight loss of

stored paddy due to dryness.

the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the 'No Evidence Rule'

when evaluating the facts of the case.

It is important to note that the Appellant by this application is challenging

the correctness of the determination as opposed to the lawfulness of the arbitral

award by way of writ jurisdiction.

Section 58 of the Co-operative Societies Law reads as follows: -

(J) (e) ----

A claim by a registered society for any debt, demand or damages due to it from a

member, officer or employee, whether past or present, or any nominee, heir or

legal representative of a deceased member, officer or employee, whether such

debt, demand or damages be admitted or not, shall be deemed to be a dispute

touching the business of the society within the meaning of this subsection.

(2) The Registrar may, on receipt of a reference under subsection (l)-

(a) decide the dispute himself, or

Page 3 of 8

(b) refer itfor disposal to an arbitrator or arbitrators.

(3) Any party aggrieved by the award of the arbitrator or arbitrators may appeal

therefrom to the Registrar within such period and in such manner as may be

prescribed by rules.

(4) No party to any appeal made to the Registrar under subsection (3) shall be

entitled, either by himself or by any representative, to appear before and be

heard by the Registrar on such appeal.

(5) A decision of the Registrar under subsection (2) or in appeal under

subsection (3) shall be final and shall not be called in question in any civil

court.

The contention of the Appellant is that the short fall in stored paddy was

due to dry weather conditions which prevailed in the area during the relevant

period. The Appellant also contends that the Arbitrator completely disregarded the

evidence given by the General Manager of the 2nd Respondent society that on

previous instances store keepers were given a 3.42% waiver on the short fall of

stored paddy due to dryness and also in other instances, the shortfall had been

completely set off against loss of weight. It is also argued that the arbitrator has

failed to consider that the sealed test bags placed inside the storage facility

recorded a weight loss of 5.47% due to dry weather conditions. The sealed 9 test

bags were kept for the purpose of verifying the process of dryness and were stored

on 03/03/1998 and on 07/03/1998. On 28/12/1998, after a period of9 months, the

said bags were opened and weighed.

It is observed that the Arbitrator had given due consideration to the

moisture content of the paddy stored and also to the paddy purchased by other

storage facilities which is alleged to have contributed to the loss of weight in the 9

sealed bags. Other related factors attributed to loss of weight were also considered

such as the weather report submitted by the Meteorological Department before

deciding on the 3% waiver on the said shortfall. Having considered all the above

factors led in evidence, the Arbitrator made award reducing the liability of the

Appellant from Rs. 983,809/47 to Rs. 484,616/44.

The Appellant admits that there is a short fall in stock, however, attributes

it to dry weather conditions. In the circumstances, it is my view that the Arbitrator

has given due consideration to all factors resulting in the loss of weight before

arriving at the 3% waiver due to the short fall as a result of dryness of the stored

paddy.

This brings me to the second issue urged by the Appellant regarding the 'no

evidence rule'.

The Appellant at page 5 of the written submissions filed of record admits

that there was a shortage of paddy, however, in the same page he contends that the

Arbitrator "had no evidence to indicate that there was a shortage of paddy" and

therefore, Appling the 'no evidence rule', the conclusions arrived on a shortage of

Page 5 of8

stored paddy is ultra vires the powers of the arbitrator and therefore, the impugned

award should be set aside. It is observed that the Appellant has failed to adduce

any material to support the exception of 'no evidence' to allege that the findings of

the arbitral award was made in ignorance of the said rule.

Wade and Forsythe, Administrative Law, 7th Edition at p. 312, states;

"no evidence does not mean only a total dearth of evidence. It extends to any case

where the evidence, taken as a whole, is not reasonably capable of supporting the

finding or where, in other words, no tribunal could reasonably reach that

conclusion on that evidence ".

It goes on to state at page 316;

"It seems clear that this ground of judicial review ought now to be regarded as

established on a general basis ", and forecasts that, no evidence "seems destined

to take its place as yet a further branch of the principle of ultra vires, so that Acts

giving powers of determination will be taken to imply that the determination must

be based on some acceptable evidence. If it is not, it will be treated as arbitrary,

capricious and obviously unauthorized".

In Rajapakse Vs. Gunasekera (1984) 2 SLR I at page 6, Sharvananda, J

(as he then was) cited with approval the following dictum by Lord Radcliffe in

Edwards Vs. Bairstow (1955) All ER 48,57 elucidating the criteria for identifying

errors of law.

"1 think that the true position of the Court in all these cases can be shortly stated. if a'party to a hearing before commissioners expresses dissatisfaction with their

determination as being erroneous in point to law, it is for them to state a Case,

and in the body of it to set out the facts that they have found as well as their

determination. 1 do not think that inference drawn from other facts are incapable

of being themselves findings of fact, although there is value in the distinction

between primary facts and inferences drawn from them. When the Case comes

before the Court, it is its duty to examine the determination having regard to its

knowledge of the relevant law. If the Case contains anything ex facie which is bad

in law and which bears on the determination, it is, obviously, erroneous in point of

law. But, without any such misconception appearing ex facie, it may be that the

facts found are such that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to

the relevant law could have come to the determination under appeal. In those

circumstances, too, the Court must intervene. It has no option but to assume that

there has been some misconception of the law, and that this has been responsible

for the determination. So there, too, there has been an error in point of law. "

As pointed out earlier, the Arbitrator had reached his conclusions on facts

supported by acceptable evidence. It is only an inference based on a complete

absence of evidence that could give rise to a misdirection in law. Therefore, I do

not see any reason to apply the 'no evidence rule' as a basis of review in the

instant application.
