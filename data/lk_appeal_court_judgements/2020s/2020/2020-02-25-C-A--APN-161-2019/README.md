************

Hon. Justice K.K. Wickremasinghe

Counsel informs Court that they are before this bench against the order of the learned

Magistrate.

The learned High Court Judge has not made any order with regard to the Magistrate's

Court case and there is no order to canvass before this Court. Now the learned counsel

concedes the fact, that there is no order made by the learned High Court Judge.

Therefore, counsel for the Appellant is withdrawing the Application.

Accordingly, Application is hereby dismissed without costs.

Hon. Justice K.Priyantha Fernando I agree.
