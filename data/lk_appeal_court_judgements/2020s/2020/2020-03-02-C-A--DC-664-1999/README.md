This is an appeal against the judgment of the learned District Judge of Avissawella dated

10.09.1999.

The plaintiff instituted the above styled action in the District Court of Avissawella seeking inter

alia to partition th e allotment of land marked Lot 1 depicted in plan no. 1604 dated 26.12.1962

made by S. R. Yapa, Licensed Surveyor situated in Eheliyagoda containing in extent A.l-R.2-P.27

morefully described in the schedule 'lfl' to the plaint dated 27.03.1989 [page 43 of the Appeal

Page 2 of 7

Brief]. The plaintiff averred that the land sought to be partitioned is a divided and a defined

portion of a land called 'Kendagawapurana' alias 'Bandarapurana' alias 'Koratuwewatta' alias

'Kadewatte' morefully described in the schedule' If' to the said plaint.

It was further averred in the plaint that there is an existing action to partition Lot 3 in the said

plan no. 1604 and Lot 2 in the said plan no. 1604 is seized and possessed by the villagers thus the

land to be partitioned is limited to Lot 1 in the said plan no. 1604.

A commission was issued to survey the land to be partitioned. Accordingly, plan no. 3849 dated

09.04.1990 made by S. Ramakrishnan, Licensed Surveyor [page 372 of the Appeal Brief] and the

surveyor's report dated 30.04.1990 [page 373 of the Appeal Brief] were produced. The land

sought to be partitioned is depicted as Lots 1 and 2 in the said plan no. 3849.

The 1st - 3rd defendants filed their amended statement of claim on 12.07.1993 [page 50 of the

Appeal Brief] averring that the plaintiff has fraudulently excluded Lots 2, 3 and 4 in the said plan

no. 1604 from the land to be partitioned. They sought a dismissal of the action of the plaintiff.

The 4th and 5th defendants filed their statement of claim on 22.02.1991 [page 47 of the Appeal

Brief] providing an alternative pedigree and claimed the buildings and cultivations in Lot 2 in the

said plan no. 1604.

After a short trial, the learned District Judge dismissed the plaint holding that that the co-

ownership rights of the parties to the action are not limited to Lot 1 in the said plan no. 1604 and

hence the plaintiff cannot maintain the action without surveying the larger land. Being aggrieved,

the plaintiff appealed.

There is no dispute that the land sought to be partitioned (i.e. Lot 1 in plan no. 1604 dated

26.12.1962 made by S. R. Yapa, Licensed Surveyor) is depicted as Lots 1 and 2 in plan no. 3849

dated 09.04.1990 made by S. Ramakrishnan, Licensed Surveyor. The contention ofthe defendants

is that the land sought to be partitioned by the plaintiff cannot be partitioned alone as it forms

part of a larger land. However, the defendants did not seek to have the larger land partitioned.

They sought a dismissal of the action ofthe plaintiff.

The only question before this court is whether the land sought to be partitioned by the plaintiff

(i.e. Lot 1 in plan no. 1604 dated 26.12.1962 made by S. R. Yapa, Licensed Surveyor or Lots 1 and

2 in plan no. 3849 dated 09.04.1990 made by S. Ramakrishnan, Licensed Surveyor) can be

partitioned among the parties to the instant action without surveying and/or partitioning the

larger land.

The evidence led, both oral and documentary, reveal that there had been a rei vindicatio action

in 1964 in respect of the larger land in the District Court of Avissawella (case bearing no. 9865/L).

Page 3 of7

The said rei vindicatio action was instituted by the plaintiff and the father of the 1st -3rd

defendants of the instant action. The settlement entered by the learned District Judge in the said

case no. 9865/L is marked as 'e,14' [page 306 of the Appeal Brief].

A careful perusal of 'e,14' shows that the subject matter of the said case no. 9865/L is depicted

in plan no. 1604 dated 26.12.1962 made by S. R. Yapa, Licensed Surveyor as Lots 1-4. Under and

by virtue of the said settlement, the plaintiffs of the said action (i.e. the plaintiff and the father of

the 1st - 3rd defendants of the instant action) collectively became entitled to an undivided 22/24

share of Lots 1, 2 and 4 in the said plan no. 1604. They also became entitled to an undivided 1/3

share of Lot 3 in the said plan no. 1604.

Our law recognizes several ways of terminating co-ownership of a property. One such way is to

institute an action under the provisions of Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 as amended. If not, all the

co-owners can together dispose the co-owned property to a single person. An amicable partition

is also recognized by law as a division that puts an end to co-ownership of a property [5. 1. Mas

and Others v. 5. R. Dias (61 N.loR. 116), Appuhamy v. Premalal and Eight Others (1984) 1 Sri.loR.

299].

'e,13' [page 300 of the Appeal Brief] is the plaint filed in the said case no. 9865/lo It is apparent

by the contents of 'e,13' that the plaintiffs of the said action (i.e. the plaintiff and the father of

the 1st - 3rd defendants of the instant action) relied on the same deeds that were marked during

the trial of the instant action in establishing their co-ownership to the larger land in order to

obtain a declaration of title in their favour in the said case no. 9865/lo

However, a plan was prepared for the said case no. 9865/L dividing the larger land (which was

the subject matter of the said case no. 9865/L) into four (04) allotments of land. A settlement was

entered and it was read over and explained to the parties of the said case no. 9865/lo The parties

have even signified their consent by signing the shorthand script of the decree [page 306 of the

Appeal Brief].

Possession of divided portions by different co-owners is in no way inconsistent with common

possession [Wickremaratne and Another v. Alpenis Perera (1986) 1 Sri.loR. 190J. However, where

co-owners executed deeds for divided shares and possessed different lots that will be indicative

ofthe division of the entire land [Girigoris Appuhamy v. Maria Nona (60 N.loR. 330)J.

Page 4 of 7

In view of the above, I hold that the plan prepared for the said case no. 9865/L dividing the larger

land into four (04) allotments as well as the settlement entered in the same and the parties

signing the shorthand script of the decree agreeing to the division are very clear evidence of the

amicable termination of the co-ownership of the parties to the larger land.

Therefore, I hold that the co-ownership to the larger land came to an end when the settlement

in the said case no. 9865/L was entered and it also created new co-ownership rights to the defined

and divided allotments ofthe larger land. This is evidenced by deed no. 23052 dated 17.09.1969

(el122) wherein Albert Eheliyagoda (the predecessor of the 1st to 3,d defendant-respondents)

expressly states that he was transferring the rights acquired by the judgment in D. C. Avissawella

case no. 9865 (ell14).

In view of the above, if the plaintiff so wishes, he is entitled to partition Lots 1, 2 and 4 in the said

plan no. 1604 as he and the father of the 1st - 3,d defendants collectively became entitled to an

undivided 22/24 share of the said lots. However, it does not prevent the plaintiff from instituting

separate actions to partition the same. Hence the plaintiff is entitled to maintain an action to

partition Lot 1 in the said plan no. 1604.

The above conclusion is based on the finding that the land sought to be partitioned is not part of

a larger land. I wish to consider the position in the event that that the land sought to be

partitioned is part of a larger land as submitted by the lA, lB, 2nd, 3,d, 4th and 5A Defendants-

Respondents.

As I observed earlier, even though the defendants claimed that the land sought to be partitioned

by the plaintiff cannot be partitioned alone as it forms part of a larger land, they did not seek to

have the larger land partitioned. They sought a dismissal of the action of the plaintiff on the basis

that he is seeking to partition only a portion of a larger land co-owned by the parties to the instant

action.

Sections 19(2)(a) ofthe Partition Law reads-

"Where a defendant seeks to have a larger land than that sought to be partitioned by the

plaintiff made the subject-matter af the action in order to obtain a decree for the partition

or, sale of such larger land under the provisions of this Law, his statement of claim shall

include a statement of the particulars required by section 4 in respect of such larger land;

and he shall comply with the requirements of section 5, as if his statement of claim were

a plaint under this Law in respect of such larger land. "[Emphasis added]

Page 5 of 7

The earlier legal position was that where a defendant to a partition action claims that the land

sought to be partitioned is part of a larger land, he could make an application in terms of section

19(2) of the Partition Law to partition the larger land or he could move for a dismissal of the

action on the basis that the plaintiff was seeking to partition only a portion of the land

[Dharmaratana Thera v. Siyadaris and Others (1985) 2 SrLL.R. 245].

However, later in Soysa v. Silva and Others [(2000) 2 SrLL.R. 235] it was held that on a reading of

section 19(2)(a) of the Partition Law, it is imperative on the part of the defendant who seeks to

have a larger land than that sought to be partitioned by the plaintiff to follow the procedure laid

down under sections 4, 5 and 6 of the Partition Law, which means that such defendant should act

as a plaintiff in a partition action. However, Dharmaratana Thero v. Siyadoris and Others (supra)

was not considered.

The word "shall" in its ordinary signification is mandatory though there may be considerations

which influence the court in holding that the intention of the legislature was to give a discretion.

But this word is not necessarily mandatory, nor always mandatory. Whether the matter is

mandatory or directory only depends upon the real intention of the legislature which is

ascertained by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute to be construed

[Mahindasoma v. Maithripala Senanayake and Another (1996) 1 SrLL.R. 180].

In the case of Nestle Lanka Limited v. Consumer Affairs Authority and Another [(2005) 2 SrLL.R.

138], Sripavan J. (as he was then) observed-

"The responsibility of the court is to construe and enforce the laws of the land as they are

and nat ta legislate an the basis af persanal inclinations. Thus, the function of a judge is ta

give effect to the expressed intention of Parliament as stated in the enactment. If the

wards of an Act are plain and clear, a court must follaw them and leave it ta Parliament

to set it right rather than to alter those wards to give a different interpretation."

It is evident upon a plain reading of the preamble of the Partition Law that the intention of the

legislature was to provide for the partition and sale of land held in common. Those who come

before court in a partition action are those who cannot share and use the co-owned land

peacefully. Therefore, when a co-owner is seeking to partition a land held in common, a duty is

cast on court to accommodate such party to end the common ownership within the available

legal framework. If the word "shall" is read as meaning "may", the whole of the provision in

section 19(2) of the Partition Law becomes meaningless and superfluous as it will allow one co-

owner to continue the common ownership of a land against the wishes of another co-owner who

seeks to partition the same forthe reason that it has become difficult to hold the land in common.

Page 6 of7

In view of the above, I hold that the word "shall" used in section 19(2) of the Partition Law should

be read as mandatory and that it is imperative on the part of a defendant who claims that the

plaintiff is seeking to partition only a portion of a larger land to follow the procedure laid down

in section 19(2) of the Partition Law and move for the larger land to be partitioned. He cannot ask

for dismissal of the action. Such a course of action is fair by all parties as it does not deprive the

defendant of getting the larger land partitioned.

The 1st - 3rd defendants filed their amended statement of claim on 12.07.1993 and stated that

the land to be partitioned should contain Lots 1- 4 in plan no. 1604 aforesaid. Although the 1st -

3rd defendants sought to have a larger land than that sought to be partitioned by the plaintiff,

they have not acted according to the provisions of section 19(2) of the Partition Law.

For all the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge of Avissawella

dated 10.09.1999. I make further order directing the learned District Judge of Avissawella to enter

fresh judgment on the merits of the case after considering the evidence already led and take

further action according to law. I am moved to follow this course as the learned District Judge

answered only a few of the issues relevant to the claim that only a small portion of a larger land

is sought to be partitioned without answering all the other issues. If this court answers all the

issues, it will be depriving parties the right of appeal they have against the judgment of the District

Court after answering all issues.

The appeal is allowed with costs.
