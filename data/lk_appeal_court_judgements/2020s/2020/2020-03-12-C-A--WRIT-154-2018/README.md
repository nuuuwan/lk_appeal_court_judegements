Argued and

Decided on 03/03/2020.

Hon. Justice Janak de Silva

The Petitioner was given a permit in terms of Section 19 (2) of the

Land Development Ordinance for an extent of 2 Roods. The permit is

marked "Au with the petition and identifies the extent of land by metes and

bounds as 2 roods in extent. The Complaint of the Petitioner is that

thereafter the Colony Officer of the area came and obtained the said permit

marked "Au claiming that it was required for an official purpose and

accordingly the Petitioner allowed the 1st Respondent to take away the

permit. On or about 11/9/2015 which is about a week after the permit was

collected by the 1st Respondent, it was returned to the Petitioner. The

Petitioner then found that the permit had been altered to reduce the extent

of land from 02 Roods to 01 Rood. The amended permit has been marked

The above facts are not disputed by the Respondents except that

they claim that the 1st Respondent informed the Petitioner that the

Petitioner was entitled only for 01 Rood in terms of a decision taken at the

Land Kachcheri and the amendment of the permit was done on that ground.

3

The Petitioner disputes of being informed of the reasons for the change in

extent.

Even upon a perusal of the documents marked "R - 7" and "R - 8" it

is clear that even the official records ofthe Divisional Secretariat had initially

identified the land as 02 Roods in extent.

Where the State or any of it officers makes a representation to a

person that he will be entitled to enjoy a particular right that person will

have a legitimate expectation of doing so unless the holding out is contrary

to law. Where a legitimate expectation has been so created in a person, this

Court will intervene in two ways in order to protect such legitimate

expectation. Firstly, where the legitimate expectation has been frustrated

or denied without giving that person a hearing, Court will ensure that the

party, entertaining a legitimate expectation will be afforded an opportunity

of being heard prior to any change of the legitimate expectation. Secondly,

even where the State is entitled to change a representation after giving

hearing to a party this Court may protect the legitimate expectation as a

substantive right after balancing the interest of party against the public

interest.

In this case there is no affidavit of the Colony Officer indicating that

the Petitioner was given a hearing before the extent of land was changed

4

from 02 Roods to 01 Rood. In those circumstances, Court is of the view that

the legitimate expectation the Petitioner entertained as a result of permit

marked "A" has been frustrated by issuing a permit marked "B" without

giving the Petitioner a hearing.

For the aforesaid reasons, Court grants a Writ of Certiorari quashing

the decision shown in the permit marked "B" reducing the extent of land

given to the Petitioner from 02 Roods to 01 Rood.

This order will not prevent the State from giving a hearing to the

Petitioner on whether the Petitioner is entitled to retain the 02 Roods.

Application is allowed to the extent setout above. No costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Hon.Justice Bandula Karunarathna.

I agree.
