allowing the prosecution to lead evidence by overruling the preliminary objection taken up by the Counsel for the I st Accused - Petitioner.

Facts of the case:

2. The Accused-Petitioner (hereinafter referred as the Petitioner) and three others have been

indicted before the High Court of Colombo in the case bearing no HC 8377116 for offences under Public Property Act No.12 of 1982. The said indictment was served on the Petitioner on the 2nd of November 2016 along with the list of witnesses and the documents.

3. The Prosecution has tendered the notice of computer generated evidence that the prosecution intended to lead evidence on material under and in terms of Evidence (Special Provisions Act) No 14 of 1995 to all the accused on 02.11.2016.

4. On the 10.11. 2016 the Petitioner while complying Section 7(1) (b) of the Evidence (Special Provisions Act) No 14 of 1995 sought permission to access and inspect.

5. The prosecution has been unable to respond the said request made by the Petitioner, within

the stipulated time period of IS days in terms of section 7 (I) (c ) of the Evidence (Special Provisions Act) No 14 of 1995. The prosecution has made an application only after IS days permitting access to and to inspect the computer evidence. At that point of time the learned Counsel appearing for the I st Accused - Petitioner has taken up a preliminary objection for the inspection, on the basis that the prosecution has failed to comply with section 7(1) (c) of the said Act by providing access and inspection within a reasonable time (within IS days). Therefore the Counsel for the Petitioner argued that since the application was not made within the permitted time as stipulated in section 7 (1)( c) of the Act, the prosecution is prohibited from tendering the evidence.

6. For the purpose of determining whether the High Court judge has erred in law and this

application should be allowed, the attention should be drawn to the applicable statutory

provIsions.

Section 7 of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act (No. 14 of 1995) states as follows.

(I)(b) any party to whom a notice has been given under the preceding provision may, within Fifteen days of the receipt or such notice apply to the party giving such notice, to be permitted access to, and to illspect:

3

Website Copy Website Copy

(i) the evidence ought to be produced;

(ii) the machine, device or computer, as the case may be, used to produce the evidence;

(iii) any records relating to the production of the evidence or the system used in such production;

(c) upon receipt of the application to be permilled access to, and to inspect such evidence,

machine, device, computer, records or system, the party proposing 10 tender such

evidence shall, within reasonable time, but not later thanfifieen days after the receipt

of the application, comply with the request and provide a reasonable opportunity to

the party applying or his agents or nominees, to have access to, and inspect, such

evidence, machine, device, computer, records or systems, as is mentioned in the

application

(d) ...

(2) Save as provided for in sections 8 and 9 where any party proposing to tender any

evidence under the provisions of this Act, fails to give notice as aforesaid, or upon

application being made for access and inspection, fails to provide a reasonable

opportunity therefore, or fails to comply with any order or direction given, by court

under paragraph (a), such party shall not be permitted to tender such evidence in

respect of which the failure was occasioned. "

7. The matter to have been determined by the learned High Court Judge was that whether he

should have permitted the prosecution to allow to lead computer evidence, even though the prosecution has failed to comply with Section 7(1) (c) of the Act.

8. It is pertinent to note that even though the prosecution was unable to respond the said request in terms of section 7(1) (c) within the time period of 15 days as stipulated in the

Evidence (Special Provisions ) Act, the prosecution had expressed its willingness to provide the opportunity for the inspection of the computer network by letter dated 03.01.2017 and the Petitioner has admitted that he had received the said letter on 05.01.2017.

4

9. Hence, it should be noted that whether there was in fact a failure of the prosecution in complying with section 7( 1 ) (c).

10. The Petitioner has submitted an array of cases namely Silinona v Dayalal Silva (1992 I SLR 195), Fernando v Sybil Fernando (1997 3SLR 1), Perera v.Perera (1981 2SLR 41) Silva v. Sankaram (2002 2 SLR 209), Wickramasinghe v de Silva (1978/79 2SLR 65) lliangaratne v. Kandy Municipal Council (1995 BALl Vol 6), Edirisuriya v. Nawaratnam (1985 1 SLR 100) etc. 1 am of the view that none of these cases cited by petitioner have dealt with a matter in relation to the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act (No. 14 of 1995), which is the applicable law in this case. The cases referred by the Petitioner are in fact related to the rules of the Court of Appeal and sections under other statutes but not the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act (No. 14 of 1995)

II. The Learned High Court Judge in the judgement dated 21.02.2018 has pointed out the inapplicability of the Supreme Court Judgement 65/2003 mentioned by the learned PC on behalfofthe petitioner and has observed as follows:

"@@I If?ll8 62ffi @f9<ic.:l,BZSlO~ 25lQ@/) ~25l @d 7 @8l 8 (SllsJ'lSlc.:li') lf ~'C 8 ;5lo~c.:l ZSlO <n15l

12. The Petitioner has cited to the case of Silva v. Sankaram (2002 2 SLR 209) where it was contended that, the appeal is out of time and it has been held that:

"(/) A strict compliance is imperative and non-compliance isfatalto the appeal.

(2) The words 'within 60 days ' in section 755 (3) restrict the right of the appellant to file the petition of appeal beyond the time frame of 60 days"

13. The above matter is in relation to the computation of 60 days with regard to the Civil Procedure Code and the decision of the above case does not have any bearing to this case. Similarly the cases referred by the petitioner, where adhering to the time limits have been mandatory do not have any bearing to this case.

14. For the purpose of determining whether the prosecution is debarred from leading computer evidence should be considered after scrutinizing section 7 (I ) (d) stipulated as follows:-

5

Website Copy Website Copy

(d) where Ihe party proposing 10 tender such evidence is unable to comply, or does nol

comply with, the application/or access and impection, or where Ihe parties are unable to agree on any mailer relating to the notice or the application/or access and impection or the manner and extent o/the inspection, the court may Oil applicatioll made by either party, make such order or give such directioll, as the illterests of justice may require.

15. The phrase "the court may Oil applicatioll made by either party, make such order or give such directioll, as the illterests of justice may require" emphasises on the fact that section

itself states that when there is a noncompliance or disagreement by the parties relating to the notice of the application for inspection, the court may make an order or give directions in the interest of justice. This section has been analyzed by the Learned High Court Judge for the purpose of establishing the fact that merely noncompliance by the prosecution with section 7(1)(c) by providing access and inspection within a reasonable time, but not later than fifteen days, should not result in the prosecution being prohibited from tendering the evidence in respect of which the failure was occasioned.

16. Hence it is evident that the intention of legislature is to provide the judge with a discretionary power in the interest of justice by adopting a more liberal view to accomplish the objectives of the said act though the learned President's Counsel submitted otherwise. However the state counsel would have acted in a diligent manner. It is clear that Section 7(1) (d) of the Act provides the Judge to direct the party to inspect the computer evidence upon an application being made for access and inspection to dispense justice. Therefore the legislature is very clear that when there is a delay in making an application to Court in order to inspect or to have access to computer evidence, the Judge has a discretion to permit the applicant to lead such evidence as the interests of justice may require. In this present case it is very clear that it was a mistake.

17. Therefore I am of the view that no prejudice has been caused to the Petitioner by allowing such application, especially when there is a statutory provision provided as mentioned above, the learned High Court Judge need not go on a voyage of discovery in searching for more provisions or reasons for allowing the admissible on such evidence.

18. Moreover it is pertinent to note that with the development of the law during the course of time, the courts have adopted a more liberal view on limitations of time periods. None of the jurisdictions (Australia, India and United Kingdom) where the legislative provisions are very much advance with regard to the procedure in combating cybercrime have laid down any time frame to lead computer evidence. That itself proves that laying down many time frames, create resistance to dispense justice.

19. Furthermore, it is of my view, where the party proposing to tender such evidence is unable

to comply or does not comply with, the petitioner could have made an application for access and inspection in terms of section 7(1) (d) of the act. Thereby, I agree the observation of the Learned High Court Judge as follows:

" ~2l"l 152Sl 2SlJC 8 0 J1) 2SJ C ~ o,<l!l& c'C I)B2S'i o(1)2l"l l)15l'tl2Sl6,u 9 0!) 0l~ C6b 02l"lJ ~ 2S'i0 2S'i

20. In the case of Bank of Ceylon v. Kaleel and Others (C.A No. 500/2000) it has been

stated that

"In any event to exercise revisionary Jurisdiction the order challenged must have occasioned afailure of Justice and be manifestly erroneous which go beyond an error or defect or irregularity that an ordinary person would instantly react to it - the order complained of is of such a nature which would have shocked the conscience of COl/rt. "

2 I. In conclusion, I observe that in the present case there had been no miscarriage of justice,

irregularity or injustice in the order of the Learned High Court Judge and therefore the revisionary powers of this Court shall not be exercised.

22. In the light of the abovementioned factual and legal background I find that the order of

the learned High Court Judge is in accordance with the law and thereby affirm the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 21 .02.201 8.

23. The revision application is hereby dismissed without costs.

K. PRIY ANTHA FERNANDO, J.

I. I had the privilege of reading the Judgment in draft of Her Ladyship Justice K.K.

Wickremasinghe, and in principle I am in agreement with the conclusion reached by Her

Ladyship, however, I wish to state my own reasons for so doing.

2. The sole question that must be decided in this case is, whether the 15 days (Not later than

15 days) referred to in Section 7(1)(c) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of

1995 (herein after also referred to as the Act) is mandatory.

3. It is an admitted fact that the Respondent has given the required 45 days' notice on the

evidence they proposed to tender, in terms of Section 7( I )(a) of the Act. It is also not

disputed that the Petitioner has applied to have permission to access and to inspect the

device within the 15 days' time period stipulated in Section 7( I )(b). It is also not in dispute

that the Respondent failed to provide a reasonable opportunity to the Petitioner to have

access within time period stipulated in section 7(1)(c), which is 15 days. However, the

Respondent expressed the willingness to provide an opportunity for inspection by letter

dated 03.01.2017. It was nearly 55 days after the 'application for permission to access'

was made.

4. Petitioner opted not to avail itself of the given opportunity to access the device, and on

22.01.2018 the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner raised a preliminary

objection on the basis that in terms of section 7(2) of the Act, the Respondent should not

be permitted to tender such evidence as the Respondent has failed to provide a reasonable

opportunity to access as stipulated in terms of the provisions of the Act. Simply, the

Petitioner objected to have the proposed evidence admitted as the Respondent had failed

to comply with the statutory provisions of the Act which are required to be adhered to,

before such evidence is admitted.

5. Learned High Court Judge after hearing both parties made order on 21.02.2018 overruling

the Petitioner's objection.

6. Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner argued that the language of the statute

makes it clear that the 15 days' time limit provided in section 7(1 )(c) is mandatory.

7. For the Court to arrive at a right conclusion it is pertinent to be mindful of the objectives

of the Act. The intention of the legislature, when enacting the law must be taken into

consideration when interpreting the provisions of the act.

8. The Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 14 of 1995 was enacted to provide for the

admissibility of audio-visual recordings, information contained in statements produced by

computers and to provide for matters connected therewith. With the development of the

field of information technology, as there was no provision to admit the above evidence,

this law was enacted to make such evidence admissible. Hence, Court is duty bound to

give effect to the legislative intent.

9. In terms of section 7(1 )(c) of the Act, reasonable opportunity of access must be given to

the party who applies for such access within a reasonable time, but not later than 15 days

of receiving such application for permission to access. If the party proposing to tender the

evidence fails to provide a reasonable opportunity to access to inspection upon an

application being made in that regard, or fails to comply with any order or direction by

Court under sub paragraph (d), by virtue of Section 7(2) of the Act, such party shall not

be permitted to tender such evidence.

10. It is the contention of the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner that section 7

(I)(d) has no application to this case.

9

II. Paragraph (d) of Subsection (I) of Section 7 of the Act, however, provides for some

flexibility as to the time stipulations. It is clear from the wording of paragraph (d) that the

legislature envisaged practical difficulties that might ensue in the compliance of these

provisions and has empowered the court to "make such order or give such direction, as

the interest of justice may require." Therefore, the prohibition under section 7(2) operates

subject to any order or direction made by Court in terms of section 7(1)(d).

12. Although it does not appear to be relevant to determine the issue in thjs case, as reference

is made to section 3 of the Act in the written submissions of the Respondent, for the sake

of completeness I consider section 3 as well. Section 3 of the Act provides for the

determination of any matter not provided for in the Act, in the interest of justice. However,

in the instant issue there is specific provision in the Act under section 7. Section 7 provides

not only for notice to have access to inspect the devises, but also the consequences of non-

compliance. Section 7(d) provides for applications by either party where parties are unable

to agree on any mailer relating to access and inspection. Therefore, as the Act provides

for the instant issue, I am of the considered view that section 3 has no application to this

case.

13. In the instant case, Respondent has failed to take the procedural step of giving reasonable

access within the 15 days' time period. When the law provides for the consequence of

failure to take a procedural step, it is not for the Court to use its discretion contrary to the

law. In case of Seal V. Chief Constable of South Wales Police /2005/ 1 WLR 3183, it

was said that there is no doubt that in the present day the Courts will strive anxiously to

interpret the procedural provisions flexibly where that furthers the interests of justice, but

that where parliament has made it absolutely clear what the consequences are of a failure

to take a particular step, it is not for the Courts to import a discretion or flexibility that are

not there. (Archbold Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice 2019 at page 109)

14. However, on applying of the Courts' intellect on deciding whether a provIsIon IS

mandatory or directory, F.A.R. Bennion in "Statutory Interpretation: A Code" Third

Edition at page 31 reads;

"Where a requirement arises under a statute, the Court, charged with the task of enforcing

the statute, needs to decide what consequence Parliament intended should follow from

failure to implement the requirement. This is an area where legislative drafting has been

markedly deficient. Drafters find it ea.sy to use the language of command. They say that a

thing 'Shall' be done. Too often they fail to consider the consequence when it is not done.

What is not thought of by the drafter is not expressed in the statute. Yet the Courts are

forced to reach a decision. It would be draconian to hold that in every case failure to

comply with the relevant requirement invalidates the thing done. So, the Courts' answer

has been to devise a distinction between mandatory and directory dUlies. "

15. Lord Campbell in Liverpool Borough Balik V. Turner [1861/30 LJ CII, 319 at 380, said

on the question, 'What is the effect of non-compliance with procedural requirements even

if the terms 'directory' or 'mandatory' is not used?', is "to try to get the real intention oj

the legislature by carefully aI/ending to the whole scope of the statute to be construed. "

16. As a matter of general principle, Court should consider what the legislator has intended to

be the consequence of non-compliance of a procedural requirement. In this instance the

consequence of non-compliance is prohibition under section 7(2). Therefore, it seems the

time limit is mandatory. However, it is subject to any order or directive made by Court

and non-compliance of that directive in terms of S. 7( 1)( d). Therefore, the requirement of

the time limit appears to be directory because, although it lays down a time limit, the Court

is also vested with an express power under Section 7(1)(d) to vary the time limits for

compliance, the manner and extent of the inspection upon an application by either party.

In deciding on the directive to be made in terms of section 7( 1)( d) Court must give effect

to the intention of the legislature, objectives of the Act, that includes providing for the

admissibility of information contained in statements produced by computers in civil and

11

Website Copy Website Copy

criminal proceedings. Therefore, Court should not shut out available admissible evidence

unreasonably unless it can be shown that the non-compliance has prejudiced the

substantial rights of the Petitioner or it has occasioned a failure of justice.

17. It is pertinent to note that although the willingness to give access and to inspect was

conveyed to the Petitioner after the stipulated time period, the preliminary objection was

not raised immediately after the lapse of the time limit, but on 09.01.2018. Petitioner has

not even made use of section 7(1)(d) to get a directive from Court although it is not

incumbent upon him to do so. It was the Petitioner who made the application for access

in terms of section 7 (I )(b), although he opted not to have access thereafter with the

intention of making use of section 7(2) to shut the evidence the prosecution intends to

adduce out.

18. Petitioner would have expected to have access to the computers within the stipulated time

period. Obviously, the prosecution had not been vigilant or had been negligent to take

necessary steps to give access within the prescribed period, or at least to make an

application in terms of section 7(l)(d). It is possible that the resultant situation might have

caused some inconvenience to the Petitioner, for which the prosecution is responsible and

there is a need for the prosecution to respect these provisions and ensure compliance.

When the prosecution indicated that they intend presenting evidence which would attract

the provisions of the Act, the prosecution also must be alive to the fact that there is a

possibility of an application for access being made by the Petitioner and be ready to meet

such application if so made. The prosecution cannot go into a slumber and deprive an

opportunity afforded to an accused under the statute. However, upon considering the

sequence of events and the facts and circumstances relating to the matter before us, I see

no substantial prejudice caused to the Petitioner by the delay of 40 days in having access

to the devices in terms of section 7( 1)( c) of the Act. It is incumbent upon the Court to act

in the interest of Justice and to give effect to the intention of the legislature. I see no

12

miscarriage of justice occasioned by the order of the learned High Court Judge. Hence, I

see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court Judge.
