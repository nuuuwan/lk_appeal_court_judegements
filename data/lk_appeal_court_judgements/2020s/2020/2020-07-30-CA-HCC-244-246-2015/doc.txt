The Accused Appellants filed this appeal seeking to set aside the judgment of the Learned High

Court Judge of Nuwara Eliya dated 08.12.201S in case No. HCINE1l42/2010.

Facts of the Case

The 1" Accused Appellant was the Chairman and the 2nd and 3rd Accused Appellants were the

Directors of the Regional Rural Development Bank (RRDB) Nuwara .Eliya, at all times

pertaining to the transaction which had been the subject matter of this case.

The Regional Rural Development Banks are governed under the Central Bank of Sri Lanka by a

Chairman and Board of Directors appointed by the Monetary Board where the initial capital for

the Regional Rural Development Banks is provided by the Central Bank. The Board of Directors

duly appointed are to administer any Regional Rural Development Bank as per the express

guidelines given in the handbook which specifies the procedure to be followed by a Regional

Rural Development Bank especially with regard to calling of tenders and authorizing

investments.

When awarding a tender or authorizing an investment, the Board of Directors of a Regional

Rural Development Bank is authorized to approve up to a value of Rs.SOO,OOOI= without the

approval of the Central Bank. Any amount exceeding Rs.SOO,OOOI= is subjected to be approved

by the Central Bank or the Cabinet of Ministers prior to calling for tenders or authorizing an

investment in any project by the Board of a Regional Rural Development Bank.

The Accused Appellants in the instant case have granted Rs.21.04 million as an investment

project to import seed potatoes without the due approval of the Central Bank or the Cabinet of

Ministers where there is a direct violation of the stipulations of the Central Bank guidelines.

The three Accused Appellants with two others were indicted before the High Court of Nuwara

Eliya punishable under Section 389 of the Penal Code read with Section 32 of the Penal Code

and Section S(\) of the Offences against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982.

At the Conclusion of the Trial, the Learned High Court Judge of Nuwara Eliya convicted the I",

2nd and 3rd Accused Appellants and acquitted the 4th Accused. The Sth Accused had passed away

before the conclusion of the Trial. Each of the Accused Appellant was imposed with a

Page 3 of 19

punishment of 4 years simple imprisonment and Rs.J9 million fine with a default sentence of 2

years.

Grounds of Appeal

As agreed by the parties of the case, the three peti tions of appeal shall be considered together and

there will be only one Judgement. The grounds of appeal of each Accused Appellant shall be

Million.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to approach the fact that the accused had acted

in bona fide.

4. The decision of the Learned High Court Judge is erroneous.

2. Proof of Mens Rea

3. Proof of Common Intention

Legal Analysis

I. The argument that was brought on behalf of the 2nd and 3rd Accused - Appellants

was that the Learned Trial Judge had totally misapprehended the ingredients of the

offence of Criminal Breach of Trust as set out it out in the Penal Code, and thereby

failed to decide the stage at which the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust had been

committed. Further, the Counsel for the 1" Accused-Appellant also illustrated the

fact that the prosecution had not established the ingredients necessary in proof of

the charge under Section 388.

The definition of the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust as embodied in section 388 of the

Penal Code requires proof of its indispensible elements as follows:

"Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any dominion over

property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property, or

dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law

prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract,

express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or

willfully suffers any other person so to do, commits "criminal breach of trust".

The ingredients necessary to prove an allegation under this Section are:

a. Entrustment with property or dominion over property, and

b. either

I. Dishonest misappropriation or conversion to his own use,

Or

11. Dishonest user or disposal, or

111. Willfully suffering any other to do b (i) or b (ii).

1t should be noted that the core element that distinguishes criminal misappropriation from

criminal breach of trust is Entrustment of Property. In Basnayake v Inspector of Police (1961)

66 N.L.R. 379, it was held that;

"In the absence of entrustment there can be no criminal breach of trust committed in

respect of a sum of money received as security by an employer from an employee."

Page 6 of 19

,

Therefore, before moving in to the proof of other co~stituent elements of the offence, proof of

entrustment is a fundamental. The proof of entrustment can be derived from the capacity and the

power vested upon the each Accused Appellants in virtue of them being the Chairman and the

Directors of the Director Board of Regional Rural Development Bank (RRDB) of Nuwara Eliya.

When analyzing the capacity and the power it is important to look in to the objectives of

establishment of the said bank. The Regional Rural Development Banks are established under

the Regional Rural Development Banks Act, No. 15 of 1985. The preamble to the said Act itself

demonstrates the objectives of setting up a regional rural development bank.

"An act to enable the monetary board of the central bank to establish regional rural

development banks with a view to developing the rural economy by providing, for

the development of agriculture, cottage and small scale industry, fishing industry,

commerce and other development activities in rural areas ; and for matters

connected therewith or incidental thereto".

The Chairman and the Board of Directors had granted Rs. 21.04 Million to an importation

project of seed potatoes in virture of the agreement (PI) dated 1st October 1995. It was alleged

that the Accused Appellants granted the said amount to the above mentioned project without the

due approval of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka or the Cabinet of Ministers which lead to direct

violation of the banking guidelines.

The testimony of Prosecution Witness 0 I (PWO 1), in his examination in chief revealed the

capacity vested to the board of directors of the Regional Rural Development Bank (RRDB)

Nuwara Eliya when calling for tenders as follows;

Therefore, my view is that the Chairperson and the Board of Directors are vested with significant

executive power and authority to take business decisions subjected to certain limitations

The case in hand refers to a sum of Rs. 21.04 Million invested in a seed potato project which is

the property within the given meaning of the section 388. Section 388 of the penal code does not

restrict the property as movables or immoveable. In my view 'property' will depend on the

circumstances of each case. The vital fact is that whether that particular kind of property can be

subject to the acts covered by the section which is Rs. 21.04 Million in the instant case.

The simplest meaning of entrustment is handing over something into someone's care or

protection. At the trial, entrustment was elicited by the written submissions before the High

Court ofNuwara Eliya as follows;

""'lOOolSl lOJ.d qeZ)25l' qw:n25l'.2S) ",,&d2S)82riCl e::l~eZ)~ 060,cZ)e~ Bc:lo",2S) 2S)Cl~'l! "'~100

Nevertheless, I am of the view that Bank directors are the guardians of financial stability, most

importantly in the instant case they were trustees of public money. It is true that risk is an

inseparable element attached to entrustment and a criminal prosecution

should be limited to extreme cases where reasonable financial risk is exceeded. Thus, in this

regard I conclude my stance that a director of a financial institution is entrusted with the property

by the very fact of being a director himself. In the instant case, the Accused Appellants, being the

Chairman and the Directors of the Director Board, had been entrusted with the funds of the bank.

At the juncture I wish to draw my attention to a decision by the Supreme Court of India which.

As argued in the case of Jaswantrai Manilal Akhaney vs The State of Bombay, (1956) AIR

575, 1956 SCR 483;

Page 8 of 19

, ,

"Although the offence of criminal breach of. trust presupposes an entrustment, such

entrustment need not conform to all the technicalities of the law of trust, and,

consequently, in a case such as the present where the accused had the necessary

power and exercised dominion over the securities and caused wrongful loss to the

pledger and wrongful gain to the pledgee by dealing with the securities, he was guilty

of the offence".

The same view was taken up in the Case of Walgamage V. The Attorney General, (2000) 3 SLR

I, Per Fernando, J., it has been held that;

"Entrustment" does not contemplate the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of

the law of trust: it includes the delivery of property to another to be dealt with In

accordance with an arrangement made either then or previously."

In Shivnarayan v State of Maharashtra, AIR 1980 SC 439 the courts accepted a similar view;

"Thus, this Court fully approved the law laid down by the cases mentioned above that a

director was clearly in the position of a trustee and being a trustee of the assets which

has come into his hand he had dominion and control over the same."

When considering the ingredients of the above mentioned charge, the second word proceeding

entrustment is "Dominion o'ver Property". For an offence to fall under this section the requisites

of entrustment of property to the accused or dominion over it must be proved. In other words,

the accused must be in such a position where he could exercise his control over the property. The

evidence of prosecution witness 05 (PW05) distinguished the dominion that the directors had

over the property as follows;

page 468 of the brief)

The above testimony draws a distinction between the two concepts of; Management of Money

and Entrustment of Money. I would emphasize repeatedly, as discussed previously as well,

entrustment is it is sine qua non for the offence of criminal breach of trust. There is no criminal

breach of trust where there is no entrustment. Thus this Court shall be miscarrying justice, if the

words of Section 388 are construed by giving it a literal interpretation. The language of the

section is very wide. The words used are "in any manner" entrusted with property. So it extends

to entrustments of all kinds. Therefore Management of money amounts to entrustment when the

words are given a meaning beyond textual interpretation. The board of directors who claim

themselves as only managers of money cannot exonerate from their culpability by trying to draw

a misleading and ambiguous distinction between the two concepts. In view of the evidence and

circumstances, I will conclude that this court is satisfied that element of entrustment and

dominion over the property is proved against all the three Accused Appellants.

Page 10 of 19

Under Section 388 of the Penal Code, once the qualipcation of entrustment is proved, the actus

reus of the offence has to be established by proving one of the following four ways:

1. Misappropriation or conversion of the property to his own use by the

accused

2. Use or disposal of the property in violation of any direction of law

prescribing the mode in which the trust is to be discharged

3. Use or disposal of property in violation of any legal contract, express or

implied

4. Suffering any other person to do any of these acts

By referring myself to the above analysis, I would held that the Accused Appellants had

committed "Dishonest user or disposal" of such property in violation of the directions prescribed

by the law. To constitute the act of "Dishonest user or Disposal", there must be:

a. A direction of law or a legal contract (express or implied) governing the

discharge of the trust,

b. The accused must use or dispose of property in violation of the direction of

law or the legal contract, as the case may be, and

c. Such use or disposal must be dishonest.

In the instant case, the "direction of law or a legal contract (express or implied) governing the

discharge of the trust" can be referred to as the handbook which specifies the procedure to be

followed by Regional Rural Development Banks and the Accused Appellants had disposed the

property which was entrusted on them in violation of the said direction of law. And the said

"disposal" is dishonest as the Accused Appellants had failed to or ignored to comply with the

procedure provided by the hand book, i.e. to obtain the approval of the Central Bank or the

Cabinet of Ministers prior to calling for tenders or authorizing an investment in any project by

the Board of the Regional Rural Development Bank. Therefore it is proven that the Accused

Appellants had violated a direction of law which is governing the discharge of the trust.

Page 11 of 19

.

II. The question whether the Accused Appellants ~as acting under good faith was raised on

behalf of the 1st Accused Appellant.

The Offences stipulated under the Penal Code, considered including a mental element only

where a reference is made to a state of mind in the definition of the offence. As read in Section

388 of the Penal Code, criminal breach of trust includes the term "dishonestly" which requires

the proof of mens rea on the part of the accused in order to convict an accused for the said

offence.

The testimony of the first witness for the prosecution (PW I) Hewa Atapattu Dharmabandu, a

retired senior central bank officer provided ample of evidence on the regulation criteria for the

Regional Rural Development Banks under the written guidelines of the hand book given by the

Central Bank and how the Regional Rural Development Bank of Nuwara Eliya had breached

them generating a dishonest intention

The said evidence provides as to how the Chairperson and the Director Board of Regional Rural

Development Bank of N uwara Eliya had been purposely avoided the due process that is ought to

have fo llowed by them and their dishonest motive is evident from their very act of not recording

the accounts of the transaction in the prescribed manner.

In light of the above evidence, I would like to draw my attention to the submission dated

2010 1/20 14 made by the Learned Counsel for the I st Accused Appellant.

His submission clearly admits that the Accused Appellants had entered in to the contract for

importation of seed potatoes without following the due process. In my view it is clear violation

of the procedure by the said Accused Appellants. Also, in the same submission cited above the

Learned Counsel submitted that the main ingredient of 'dishonesty' against the accused had not

been proved by the prosecution which is the intention to use the money for the own benefit or

use, thereupon a conviction under Section 388 of the penal code cannot be entertained even if he

may be guilty of professional negligence.

I do agree to the fact that the dishonest intention is a basic thread and the gist running across this

provision which is proved by the former analysis as well. However even if there is no lot of

evidence in order to prove that the said appellants have used or converted the money for their

personal usage, they have caused a wrongful loss to another would suffice to sustain a

conviction. The case in hand is a serious loss to the government which includes public money

wrongfully gi ven to one party thereby caused a wrongful loss to the Republic.

Also, I would again prefer to quote how the Supreme Court of India held in the case of Krisnan

Kumar v Union of India 1959 AIR 1390.1960 SCR (1) 452;

"It was not necessary in every case to prove in what precise manner the accused person

had dealt with or appropriated the goods. The question is one of intention and not

direct proof of misappropriation. It was held that the prosecution has established that

the accused received the goods and removed it from the railway depot. That was

sufficient enough to sustain a conviction under this section."

Moreover, the fact that the I 51 Accused Appellant was not acting in good faith, but was acting

with the willful knowledge that the seed potato project had not received the required approval by

the Central Bank or the Cabinet of Ministers is amply demonstrated from the evidence given by

U.Geethananda, who was the then Secretary to the Director Board of Regional Rural

Development Bank, Nuwara Eliya. Proceedings dated 31.1 0.20 13 is reproduced hereby;

[n an Indian Judgement named Jaikrishnadas Manohardasdesai v The State Of Bombay, 1960

A1R 833, 1960 SCR (3) 329, it was held that ;

"to establish a charge of criminal breach of trust, the prosecution was not bound to

prove the precise mode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by the

accused of the property entrusted to him or over which he had dominion . The

principal ingredient of the offence of criminal breach of trust being dishonest

misappropriation the mere failure of the accused to account for the property entrusted

to him might not be the foundation of his conviction in all cases but where he was

unable to account and rendered an explanation for his failure which was untrue,

an inference of misappropriation with dishonest intent might readily be made".

Therefore, [ conclude that a conviction under section 388 of the Penal Code cannot be set aside

even if it is a mere failure to follow the proper procedure or mere failure to account for the

property which is entrusted. Even if it is a mere failure the judiciary must not construe in way so

Page 15 of 19

that perpetrators can get away effortlessly from the, criminal justice system. However in the

instant case I do not observe that the transaction as a mere failure, thus I phrase it as an overt act

where accused were unable to account and render an explanation for his failure. It shall

unavoidably be an inference of misappropriation with dishonest intent.

Ill. The question whether the Accused Appellants can be indicted under Section 32

of the Penal Code as to establish joint liability on the basis of common intention

was argued on behalf of the Accused-Appellants.

Section 32 of the Penal Code provides that;

"When a criminal act is done by several persons in furtherance of the common

intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it

were done by him alone".

The said section expresses the meaning of common intention as participation of each person in

furtherance of the shared intent.ion. The landmark case of The Queen v Mahatun, (1959) 61

N.L.R. 540 held that;

"Under section 32 of the Penal Code, when a criminal act is committed by one of

several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of them is liable

for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. If each of several

persons commits a different criminal act each Act being in furtherance of the common

intention of all, each of them is liable for each such act as if it were done by him alone.

To establish the existence of a common intention it is not essential to prove that the

criminal act was done in concert pursuant to a pre-arranged plan. A common intention

can come into existence without pre - arrangement".

The dicta in the case of Regina v Somapala, (1959)57 N.L.R. 350 emphasized that section 32

does not require imputation of the intention of knowledge of one socius criminis to another. In

Page 16 of 19

"

other words it may be observed that as long as th7re is evidence of an overt act which is

committed by an accused in furtherance of a common intention entertained by him with the other

participants of the offence is criminally liable,

The 2nd and 3'd Accused-Appellants in the instant case were holding two honorary director posts

in the Regional Rural Development Bank of Nuwara Eliya when this alleged offence was

committed. 2nd Accused-Appellant in his testimony denied that fact that he participated in the

alleged offence and his signature to the document marked PIS was taken without due consent.

This undoubtedly demonstrates that the 2nd and the 3rd Accused Appellants were present at the

board meeting dated 1995.10.31 and they had clear knowledge about the contents of the

agreement. As decided in the case of The King v Asappu, (1948) SO N.L.R. 324, the 3 ways to

test shared/common intention is;

I. Prearrangement

2. Sharing of intention.

3. Declaration of the common intention

Thus as cited earlier in the case of The Queen v Mahatun (Supra), it is not essential to prove

that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to a pre-arranged plan. Therefore the 2nd

and the 3rd Accused Appellants by virtue of the fact that they participated the meeting even

without a prearranged plan had shared the guilty intention by signing an unedited illegal

document on 1995. 10.31. Even if one argues that such act is mere presence which is not

sufficient to prove the common intention, signing to the said illegal document knowing that it

was illegal in that moment and not taking any steps to reverse such decision amounts to a

participatory presence by criminal act or illegal omission and declaration of the common '

intention

Considering above, I am of the view that the Leaqted High Court Judge came to the correct

conclusion after a careful consideration of all the evidence that was placed before him.

Therefore, I do not wish to interfere with the conviction and the sentence imposed on the

appellant, by the Learned High Court Judge and I affirm the same.

This appeal is hereby dismissed.

K. Priyantha Fernando, J.
