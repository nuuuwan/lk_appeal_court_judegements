The issue that arises for the determination of this Court at this stage is whether

the Petitioner has made out a prima facie case that the decision of the 1st

Respondent, the Municipal Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal Council,

and the 1A Respondent, the Colombo Municipal Council, to reject the bid

submitted by the Petitioner as being unresponsive, is illegal and/or

unreasonable.

3

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

By an advertisement published in the Daily News newspaper of 31st July 2017,

marked P4, the 1st Respondent, had invited bids for the supply, installation

and commissioning of a LED smart street lighting system for the City of

Colombo. The said invitation specified inter alia that:

(a) The closing date for the submission of bids shall be 25th August 2017;

(b) All bids shall be valid until 20th February 2018; and

(c) All bidders are required to submit a Bid Security, which shall be valid until

22nd March 2018.

In terms of Section 1 of the tender document, marked P8 (Instructions to

Bidders) the Project was to be carried out as a Public Private Partnership

between the Colombo Municipal Council and the successful bidder.

Accordingly, the successful bidder was required to invest the total cost of the

Project, and thereafter recover its investment through advertisements, or any

other scheme proposed by the bidder.

While Clause 8.2 of P8 specified that bids shall be valid until 20th February

2018, Clause 8.3(c) of P8 specified that the bid security shall be valid until 22nd

March 2018. It is common ground that evaluation of bids and obtaining the

necessary approvals would take time, and therefore, the need to keep the bids

alive and valid for a specified period. Furthermore, once a decision is taken,

and such decision is conveyed to the successful bidder, it takes time to execute

4

a formal contract etc, and therefore, the need to keep the bid security valid for

a period after the expiry of the validity date of the bid.

The Petitioner, who states that it is a leading engineering and construction

company and has completed several projects of high value, had collected the

tender documents on 31st July 2017.1 The pre-bid meeting had been held on 9th

August 2017, with the participation of the Petitioner, as well as others who had

collected tender documents and the Officials of the Colombo Municipal

Council.

This Court must observe that in terms of Clause 8.8(b) of P8, The employer

may, in exceptional circumstances and at its discretion, extend the deadline for

submission of Bids by issuing an addendum, in which case all rights and

obligations of the Employer and the Bidders previously subject to the original

deadline will thereafter be subject to the deadline as extended.

Together with a letter dated 18th August 2017 marked X6, the 1st Respondent

had issued to all those who had participated at the pre-bid meeting, including

the Petitioner, the minutes of the said meeting, and an amendment to the

bidding document in the form of Addendum No.1. According to the said

Addendum, marked X5a, the aforementioned dates specified in P8 had been

amended as follows:

a) The closing date of the bids had been extended until 4th September 2017;

b) The bid validity period had been extended until 2nd March 2018;

1 Vide letter dated 31st July 2012 issued by the Petitioner, marked X2.

5

c) The bid security was to be valid until 1st April 2018.

In addition to X6, the Petitioner had been informed by a letter dated 15th

August 2017, marked P5 of the above change in dates, and specifically that,

with these changes, bidding documents shall also be changed to match with

these days. A notice informing the Public about the extension of the date for

the submission of bids, the bid validity period, and the bid security, had been

published in the daily newspapers of 17th August 2017.2

Together with a covering letter dated 4th September 2017, marked P3, the

Petitioner had submitted its bid to the 1st Respondent, with paragraph two of

P3 reading as follows:

Our bid is valid till 20th February 2018 and bid security is valid until 22nd

March 2018. The bid security issued from Sampath Bank ... is attached.

Thus, as at the closing date of the bids, the Petitioner had not complied with

the extension of the bid validity period and the extended bid security date,

introduced by the Addendum X5a, and conveyed to it by P5, and X6.

The Petitioner by a letter dated 25th September 2017, marked P7a, informed

the 1st Respondent as follows: With reference to the above subject tender, we

Sierra Construction Limited herewith enclose the bid security extension letter

..... Annexed to P7a was a letter issued by the Bank extending the validity

period of the bid security until 1st April 2018.

2 Vide newspaper advertisements marked X10.

6

This Court must observe at this stage that what the Petitioner has extended by

P7a is only the validity date of the bid security and not the bid validity period.

Thus, it appears that even though the Petitioner sent the letter P7a, its bid

continued to be non-responsive for the reason that the validity period of the

bid did not meet the date stipulated by the Colombo Municipal Council.

The bids had been evaluated by a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC)

comprising of Officers of the Colombo Municipal Council. Paragraph 1 of the

report of the TEC under the heading, Responsiveness reads as follows:

Sierra Construction Limited

(a) The Bidder has been unable to submit a valid bid bond as the validity

period of bid security is upto 2018-03-22 which is shorter than the

required bid validity period (upto 2018-04-01) and the name of the

Bid security is Sierra Construction Pvt Limited which is not the present

name of bidder. Since it is a major deviation, the bid is considered as

non-responsive

The 1st Respondent had thereafter issued the 2nd Respondent a letter of

acceptance dated 11th January 2018.3

Dissatisfied with the decision of the 1st Respondent to reject its tender as well

as award the tender to the 2nd Respondent, the Petitioner filed this application,

seeking inter alia the following relief:

3 Vide X17.

7

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision to award the letter of

acceptance to the 2nd Respondent;

b) A Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to pre-qualify the

Petitioner for the said Project;

c) A Writ of Mandamus granting the Project to the Petitioner.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner challenged the above

decision to reject its tender on three principle grounds.

The first submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was

that the bid validity period can only be extended where exceptional

circumstances arise, and that, as no such circumstances had arisen, the

decision to extend the date of validity of the bid security is ultra vires and that

no consequence would flow from such decision. He relied on the provisions of

Clause 8.2(b) of P8 in support of his submission.

Clause 8.2(b) of P8 reads as follows:

In exceptional circumstances, prior to expiry of the original bid validity

period, the Employer may request from the Bidders to extend the period of

validity for a specified additional period. The request and the responses

thereto shall be made in writing or by facsimile. A bidder may refuse the

request without forfeiting its bid security. A bidder agreeing to the request

will not be required or permitted to modify its bid, but will be required to

extend the validity of its bid security for the period of the extension, and in

compliance with Clause 15 in all respects.

8

This Court does not agree with the said submission, for the following three

reasons.

The first reason is that the Petitioner has acquiesced in the said extension and

therefore, cannot complain that exceptional circumstances have not arisen,

justifying an extension.

As noted earlier, the Petitioner participated at the pre-bid meeting held on 9th

August 2017. In terms of Item 10 of the minutes of such meeting, marked

X5b, some bidder(s) have requested time extension to the closing date of the

bid, it was informed to submit it in writing and the decision will be informed to

all bidders. It is not the position of the Petitioner that it objected to such an

extension being considered and/or being granted by the 1st Respondent.

The Petitioner was thereafter served with the letter dated 15th August 2018,

marked P5, and the Addendum, marked X5a, together with the letter dated

18th August 2017, marked X6 informing inter alia that the closing date of the

bids had been extended until 4th September 2017, with corresponding changes

being made to the validity periods of the bid and the bid security. A notice

informing the Public about the extension of the relevant dates had been

published in the daily newspapers of 17th August 2017.4 Once again, there is no

material before this Court that the Petitioner objected to extensions being

granted or to the said course of action.

Not only did the Petitioner not object, the fact that the Petitioner accepted the

said extension and acted upon it is clear by the fact that the Petitioner

4 Vide newspaper advertisements marked X10.

9

submitted its bid only on 4th September 2017, which is the extended date for

the submission of bids.

The second reason why this Court cannot agree with the first submission of the

Petitioner, is that the party inviting proposals, in this case the 1st Respondent,

has the right to set out the terms and conditions governing the said invitation,

and therefore it is within the power of the 1st Respondent to determine the

closing date of tenders. This power would extend to granting of extensions of

time for prospective tenderers to prepare their bids. In coming to this

conclusion, this Court has only applied the basic principles of the Law of

Contract relating to an invitation to treat.

The 1st Respondent states that he received several requests, compendiously

marked X7, from prospective bidders, seeking an extension of the closing

date for bids. This Court has examined the said letters and observes that the

said requests have been made primarily on the ground that the Project was of

a complex nature and further time is required to prepare the bid proposal. It is

in the interests of the Colombo Municipal Council to receive as many bids as

possible, in order to maintain the competitive nature of the bidding process,

and obtain for itself, financially the most advantageous offer. It is the view of

this Court that the circumstances in which the extension was granted can be

considered as being an exceptional circumstance. Granting an extension of

time to submit bids in such circumstances cannot be considered as being

unreasonable.

This Court must observe that Clause 8.8(b) of P8 enables the 1st Respondent

to extend the deadline for the submission of bids, and requires the bidders to

10

comply with the extended deadlines. This Court is of the view that even if

provision for extensions of time has not been stipulated in the tender

document, the party inviting bids has the power to extend the time periods.

Therefore, it is the view of this Court that granting an extension would not be

illegal, and that all bidders must comply with the extended dates.

The third reason why this Court does not agree with the first submission of the

Petitioner, is that Clause 8.2(b) appears to apply to a situation which arises

after bids have been accepted. This is clear by the statement in clause 8.2(b)

that a bidder can refuse to extend the bid validity period without forfeiting the

bid security.

The second submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner

was that it was unreasonable to reject the Petitioners bid, for two reasons

The first is that in terms of Clause 8.3(b) of P8, the bid can be rejected only if

there is no bid security at all and not where there is a discrepancy with its

validity date. The second is that by the time the TEC evaluated the Bids, the

Petitioner had rectified the error.

There is no dispute that the bid was not valid until 2nd March 2018, and the bid

security was not valid until 1st April 2018. The bid submitted by the Petitioner

was therefore not in conformity with the Bidding document, as at the closing

date for submissions of bids. Whether the bid of the Petitioner can be rejected

for this deviation depends on whether the requirement that the bid security be

valid until 1st April 2018 was mandatory.

11

Clause 8.3 of P8 provides as follows:

a) The Bidder shall furnish, as part of his Bid, a Bid security of not less

than Rs. 1,500,000.

b) The bid security shall be an unconditional on demand guarantee

obtained from a reputed bank or insurance company in Sri Lanka.

c) Bid security shall be valid till 22.03.2018.

d) Any Bid not accompanying (sic) bid security mentioned in (b) above

shall be rejected by the Employer as non-responsive.

It is the view of this Court that Clause 8.3(d) would apply to all requirements of

the bid security, and accordingly, the submission of a bid security issued by a

commercial bank for a sum not less than Rs. 1.5 million, and valid for a period

of one month after the expiry of the validity period of bids had been made

mandatory by P8.

As already observed, the three dates, namely (a) the date of submission of the

bids, (b) the date until which the bid was required to be valid, and (c) the

expiry date of the bid security had been set out in the Invitation to Bid P4, the

bidding document P8, the Addendum X5a, the letter sent to the Petitioner

P5, and the paper notification that followed, namely X10, thereby

highlighting the mandatory nature of complying with such dates. The

provisions of Clauses 8.2(a), 8.3 and 8.8(b) makes it clear to this Court that

each bidder was required to comply with the dates stipulated by the 1st

Respondent, and that it was mandatory that the bid was accompanied by a Bid

Security valid until 1st April 2018. The fact that the consequence of non-

12

compliance has been stipulated in P8 itself shows that the said requirement is

mandatory. Any deviation from this requirement can be categorised as a major

deviation, and the bid of the Petitioner shall be rejected for such deviation,

without any further evaluation.

Even though the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that

the Government Procurement Guidelines do not apply to this tender, useful

guidance in this regard can be found in Sections 7.8.2 7.8.4 of the said

Guidelines. In terms of Sections 7.8.2 and 7.8.3, a deviation which is deemed

acceptable would be categorized as a minor deviation, and is one which has no

effect on the validity or legality of the Bid, or has no effect on the functionality,

quality or delivery of the Goods or Services offered, or is a slight deviation

which can be ignored. A major deviation, on the other hand is a deviation

which is unacceptable and would include non-submission of bid security,

insufficient bid security or failure to provide sufficient validity period of the

bid.5

Referring to minor and major deviations, the Supreme Court in Sunway

International (Pvt) Ltd. and Another vs Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka)

Limited and Others6 held as follows:

This classification of deviations from Bidding Documents as major or

minor, is widely accepted and was made reference to by the Andhra

Pradesh High Court in Baxalta Bioscience India Pvt. Ltd vs. The State of

Telangana, Health, Medical and Family Welfare Department and Others

(Writ Petition No. 40315 of 2016 on 13.03.2017), where it was stated that

5 Vide Sections 7.8.2 and 7.8.4. 6 SC (FR) Application No. 147/2017; SC Minutes of 2nd December 2019.

13

The requirements in a tender notice can be classified into two categories

- those which lay down the essential conditions of eligibility and the others

which are merely ancillary or subsidiary with the main object to be

achieved by the condition. In the first case, the authority issuing the tender

may be required to enforce them rigidly. In the other cases, it must be

open to the authority to deviate from and not to insist upon the strict

literal compliance of the condition in appropriate cases.

The identical issue i.e. the fact that a bid security must be valid as required

by the employer - arose in Pamkayu (M) Snd Bhd (Appearing By Its Attorney,

Hemachandra) and Another Vs. Liyanaarachchi, Secretary, Ministry of

Transport and Highways and Another.7 In that case, the Secretary, Ministry of

Transport and Highways, on behalf of the Cabinet Appointed Tender Board had

called for sealed tenders from suppliers or their accredited agents for the

supply of 100,000 Nos. Heavy Hardwood Sleepers. The Technical Evaluation

Committee had rejected 13 of the 17 offers received as being 'non-responsive,

and of the three 'substantially responsive' offers, after evaluation and for

stated reasons, had recommended that the order for the supply of Sleepers

should be awarded to the 1st petitioner which had 'complied with the technical

and commercial requirements of the tender'. The Cabinet Appointed Tender

Board while rejecting the recommendations of the Technical Evaluation

Committee, had recommended the acceptance of the tender of the 5th

respondent, which had been rejected by the Technical Evaluation Committee

as not being a responsive offer for four reasons, including the reason that the

validity of the Bid Bond submitted was valid only for 120 days instead of 150

7 [2001] 1 Sri LR 118 at pages 123 - 125.

14

days as required in the tender. Upon the petitioner challenging the decision of

the Cabinet Appointed Tender Board, the Supreme Court stated as follows:

I turn now to the matter of the bid security. It was the fourth matter

considered by the Cabinet Appointed Tender Board in deciding upon the

correctness of the decision of the Technical Evaluation Committee. Clause

13 of the 'Instructions to Bidders' states, inter alia, as follows:

". . . Bid security shall remain valid for a period of 150 days. However the

bidder should agree to extend this period of validity if requested by the

purchaser. Any bid not accompanied by an acceptable bid security shall be

rejected by the purchaser as non-responsive. . . ."

It is not in dispute that the bid bond submitted by the fifth Respondent

was valid only for a period of 120 days, whereas clause 13 of the

'Instructions to Bidders' plainly requires that "Bid security shall be valid for

a period of 150 days". In terms of clause 13, the Technical Evaluation

Committee therefore rejected the bid as being non-responsive. The

Cabinet Appointed Tender Board, however, regarded the failure of the

bidder to be a 'minor deviation.' The reason given for that view was that

the bid security was still in force and that the 'tenderer had time to extend

the validity.' There was no doubt that there had been a 'deviation' from

what was 'an acceptable bid security' as described in clause 13. There was

in fact, no 'acceptable bid security', for the period in the first instance was

expressly fixed at 150 days. Extensions of that period were provided for.

However, there was no provision enabling the extension of a period that

fell short of the stipulated 150 days. In terms of section 113 of Guidelines

15

on Government Tender Procedure a deviation might have been considered

'minor', inter alia, if it had not been specified in the bid documents as a

ground for rejection of the bid. In the matter before us, the failure to

submit an 'acceptable bid security' was specified as a ground for

mandatory rejection of a bid. Therefore, it was not open to the Cabinet

Appointed Tender Board to regard the failure of General & Railway

Supplies (Pvt.) Ltd. to comply with the provisions of clause 13 as 'minor.'

Bidders were required to furnish bid security. Such security had to be

furnished in accordance with the directions given on matters of

importance. The non-compliance related to a matter of substance and not

of mere form. The failure to comply with the directions on so important a

matter as the period required to be covered, in my view, made it an

unacceptable bid security. A bidder who submits an unacceptable bid

security is in no better position than a person who fails to furnish bid

security. Section 112.6 of the Guidelines on Government Tender Procedure

states that where bid security is required the failure to furnish a bid

security with a bid should be considered 'a major deviation' and be a

ground for the rejection of the bid.

This Court shall now consider the submission of the learned Presidents

Counsel for the Petitioner that the Petitioner had rectified the error by the

time the TEC evaluated the bid and that, the Petitioner was therefore in

compliance of the bidding document. In order to maintain a level playing field

and fairness among all bidders, it has been repeatedly held by the Supreme

Court that the rights and obligations of all bidders must be determined as at

the closing date of the bids, and that compliance with a requirement of the bid

after the closing date violates this basic requirement.

16

SmithKline Beecham Biologicals S.A. and Another Vs. State Pharmaceutical

Corporation of Sri Lanka and Others8 was a case where the selected bidder

had not been registered under the Public Contracts Act as at the closing date

of bids. The petitioner, who was one of the bidders complained to the

Supreme Court that the bid of the selected bidder could not have been

considered as it has not complied with the tender conditions relating to

registration under the said Act. The Supreme Court held as follows:

In the matter before us, on the relevant date, namely, the 3rd of July 1996

the date when the Tenders were closed, the only tenderer who was

qualified was SmithKIine Beecham Biologicals S.A. since only its Rubella

Viral Vaccine was registered as required by the Tender document (P1). The

only responsive bid was therefore that of SmithKIine Beecham Biologicals

S.A. although it was not the lowest bid. The only tenderer who was able to

comply with the requirement in Clause 19 that a copy of the certificate of

registration should be annexed to the Tender was SmithKIine Biologicals

Beecham S.A. Therefore the only complete tender was that of SmithKIine

Beecham Biologicals and therefore it was the only tender that qualified for

evaluation. The Tender Board misdirected itself by believing that it was

obliged to recommend the acceptance of the tender of Biocine S.p.A

because its price was the lowest responsive offer. It may have been the

lowest offer, but at the relevant date, namely the 3rd of July 1996 it was

not a responsive offer at all, for Biocine S.p.A. had failed to comply with

the condition of registration.9

8 [1997] 3 Sri LR 20. 9 Ibid, page 55.

17

Therefore, the Guidelines too make it clear that a Tender Board may only

consider bids which are responsive and qualified by substantially

conforming with the tender documents. The State and its agencies are

bound by and must rigorously and scrupulously observe the procedures

laid down by them on pain of invalidation of an act in violation of them.10

In Pamkayu (M) Snd Bhd (Appearing By Its Attorney, Hemachandra) and

Another Vs. Liyanaarachchi, Secretary, Ministry of Transport and Highways

and Another, the Supreme Court went onto hold as follows:11

The sixth Respondent was registered under and in terms of the Public

Contracts Act, and obtained an extension of the bank guarantee on the

10th of July 2000, whereas the tenders were closed on 16th March 2000.

The award of a tender must be based on compliance with the terms and

conditions of the tender, documents on the date and at the time

specified for the closing of the tender. An offer that does not comply with

the terms, conditions and specifications at that date and time must be

rejected in the same way as a late offer.

The above two judgments were cited with approval by the Supreme Court in

Sunway International (Pvt) Ltd. and Another vs Airport & Aviation Services

(Sri Lanka) Limited and Others.12 In this case, the petitioners claimed that

although it was not the highest bidder, it was the highest responsive bidder

by virtue of having fulfilled all of the eligibility requirements specified in the

tender documents. The bids of those who had submitted a bid higher than the

10 Ibid, page 44. 11 Supra, page 125. 12 Supra.

18

petitioner had been rejected by the Technical Evaluation Committee, including

the bid of the 11th respondent for not having the required financial capability

as required by Clause 6d of the Instructions to Bidders. The Ministerial

Procurement Committee had however decided to waive the requirement

relating to financial capacity in order to award the tender to the highest

bidder, and on the basis that it would yield a higher income to the 1st

respondent.

The Supreme Court, having taken into consideration, the aforementioned

judgments and the factual circumstances that had arisen in this application

held as follows:

The MPC had through this decision, in a context of national competitive

bidding, changed the goal post after the closure of bids on 30th December

2015 and after the TEC evaluation. If there was a genuine need to waive a

certain eligibility requirement to serve the interests of the 1st Respondent,

the process provided by Clause 11.1 of the Instructions to Bidders (P5)

could have been resorted to, and an Addendum amending the Bidding

Documents could have been issued by the Tender Board, prior to the

deadline given for submission of bids and communicated to, and

acknowledged by the Bidders.

The actions of the MPC members, namely, the waiving off of the essential

requirement of financial capability at the bid evaluation stage, and

introducing a different threshold of financial capability for the 11th

Respondent by way of an additional sum equivalent to one-month rental

applicable to the final year of contract, in lieu of the stricter requirement

stipulated in Clause 6d, are in themselves discriminatory and arbitrary.

19

Such conduct has clearly changed the goal post and hindered the

providing of an equal opportunity, by precluding other bidders who could

have otherwise submitted a higher bid than the 11th Respondent,

unencumbered by the financial capability requirement, from participating

in the bidding process. Had the waiver been notified at the point of calling

for bids, more entities would have been eligible to submit bids. It is also

discriminatory towards all the other bidders in the present case, who were

evaluated by the TEC, including the Petitioners, based on all the prescribed

qualification requirements, including that of financial capability, while the

11th Respondents compliance to it was dispensed with.

However the waiving off of certain requirements and introducing lower

thresholds, after the closure of bids, solely for increased revenue is a

compromise on the quality as well as a stark violation of the transparency

and certainty of government procurement process.

In the present application, the 1st Respondent had clearly demarcated the

goal post, and it was up to the Petitioner to comply with the same. The

acceptance of an amended bid security after 4th September 2017 would have

amounted to a shifting of goal posts. Therefore, it is the view of this Court

that the submission of a bid security after the closing date does not negate the

deviation.

The third submission of the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner was

that the Procurement Guidelines, 2006 do not apply to the tender in issue, as

contended by the learned Counsel for the 1st Respondent, and that, given the

nature of the Project that was to be carried out, what is applicable would be

20

the 1998 Guidelines for BOO/BOT projects. However, it is noted that the 1998

Guidelines too, would be applicable only to the Government. It is the view of

this Court that the necessity to consider which Guidelines would apply does

not arise as the provisions of the tender document P8 have clearly set out the

requirement of the Colombo Municipal Council, and the consequences of the

failure to submit a bid security as stipulated in P8.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the bid of

the 2nd Respondent does not meet the financial conditions of the tender

document P8, and that its bid is financially more advantageous to the CMC

than the bid of the 2nd Respondent. The learned Counsel for the 1st and 1A

Respondents and the learned Presidents Counsel for the 2nd Respondent,

while denying the above, submitted that the financial proposal of the

Petitioner is incomplete and inadequate and that the Petitioner has grossly

overestimated its bid. Quite apart from this issue being a disputed fact, this

Court does not have the expertise to consider matters relating to the

evaluation of the financial responsiveness of the bidders.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue

formal notice of this application on the Respondents. This application is

accordingly dismissed, without costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
