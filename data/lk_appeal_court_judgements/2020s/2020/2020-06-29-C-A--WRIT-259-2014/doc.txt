Petitioner on 15.08.2019, 30.09.2019 and 18.10.2019

Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner is a public officer who was entitled to import a motor vehicle with a specific

concessionary rate under the Trade, Tariff and Investment Policy circular no. 01/2010 and its

subsequent amendments including circular no. 01/2013. According to this scheme the

maximum value limit of any vehicle which can be imported was US$ 35,000.

Page 4 of 11

The Petitioner imported a brand-new Toyota Prado KDJ150 Diesel 7-seater car through the 11th

Respondent of which the CIF value was US$ 35,000 according to the Petitioner. The Petitioner is

challenging the actions of the customs in valuing the vehicle according to Gazette bearing no.

1857/3 dated 07.04.2014 (X17).

The Petitioner is further assailing the action of the customs in failing to implement excise duty

exemptions which he claims to be entitled in terms of the law.

Cabinet Approval

Article 10 of Schedule E of the Customs Ordinance reads:

"Notwithstanding the provisions of this Schedule, the Minister may, with the approval of

the Cabinet of Ministers, in the interest of national economy or for any other reason, by

Order published in the Gazette fix, for such period as may be specified in that Order,

minimum values for any goods, and the duties on those goods shall be charged on the

basis of such minimum values."

Gazette bearing no. 1857/3 dated 07.04.2014 (X17) is an Order made under this Article. There

is no dispute between parties that when this Order was published on 07.04.2014, the Minister

had not sought and obtained the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers. Cabinet approval was

given on 04.09.2014 (X26).

The learned counsel for the Petitioner contends that obtaining the approval of the Cabinet of

Ministers is a condition precedent to the power of the Minister to make an order in the nature

of X17. The learned State Counsel rejected this position and submitted that in any event the

approval of the Cabinet of Ministers has now been obtained.

The words in the interest of national economy or for any other reason in my view indicate that

what is contemplated in this article is matter of policy. It is in this context that the legislature

has required the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers.

Page 5 of 11

In Thirimavithana v. Urban Development Authority and Others [(2010) 2 Sri.L.R. 262] this Court

took the view that where section 18 of the Urban Development Authority Act allows the Urban

Development Authority to alienate any land or interest in land with the approval of the

Minister, any alienation without such approval is of no avail in law even where the approval of

the Minister has been subsequently obtained.

Nonetheless, the Court did not give any consideration on the effect of subsequent ratification

by the Minister. However, in Ratnasiri and Others v. Ellawala and Others [(2004) 2 Sri.L.R. 180]

Marsoof J. PICA held that the Public Service Commission as well as a Committee of the

Commission or a public officer exercising delegated authority may in appropriate circumstances

ratify an order made or action taken by a public officer without authority and that there is

nothing in the Constitution or any law to prevent the Respondent Secretary, from making a

decision in regard to a matter where some person or body of persons has previously made

some decision without any authority to do so. Court did refer to established administrative

practice of taking urgent action whenever exigencies of the service so demanded and obtaining

necessary covering approval thereafter, a practice which is often resorted to and is sanctioned

by administrative procedures and judicial decisions [Rajapakse v. Tissa Devendra, Chairman,

Public Service Commission and Others (1999) 2 Sri.L.R. 331].

I see no reason why this rationale should not apply in the application of Article 10 of Schedule E

of the Customs Ordinance. The interest of national economy may need urgent action to be

taken there under by the Minister subject to ratification by the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore,

I hold that the subsequent approval of the Cabinet of Ministers on 04.09.2014 (X26) of the

Gazette bearing no. 1857/3 dated 07.04.2014 (X17) gives it validity.

Rights of the Parties

Nonetheless, it is trite law that rights of the parties must be determined as at the date of

institution of proceedings or action. [Ponnammah v. Arumogam (8 N.L.R. 223 at 226), Silva v.

Nona Hamine (10 N.L.R. 44), Ponnamma v. Weerasuriya (11 N.L.R. 217), Silva v. Fernando et al

(15 N.L.R.499), Jamal Mohideen &Co. v. Meera Saibo et al (22 N.L.R. 268 at 272), Shariff et al v.

Overseas Bank (1998) 3 Sri. L. R. 197, Jayaratna v. Jayaratne and another (2002) 3 Sri. L. R. 331,

Sithy Makeena and others v. Kuraisha and others (2006) 2 Sri. L. R. 341J.

I have previously applied this principle to applications for judicial review [Tissa Abeywickrema

and Two Others v. Mayor, Badulla Municipal Council and Others (C.A. (PHC) 111/2011, C.A.M.

22.02.2019].

Although the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers was given on 04.09.2014 (X26), this

application was instituted on 04.08.2014. Hence there was no ratification of Gazette bearing

no. 1857/3 dated 07.04.2014 (X17) by the time the Petitioner invoked the jurisdiction of this

Court.

Yet, on the Petitioners own admission he had cleared the imported vehicle after paying the

duty imposed based on the minimum value of the vehicle in terms of Gazette bearing no.

1857/3 dated 07.04.2014 (X17) [page 4 of written submissions dated 15.08.2019J. Nonetheless,

the Petitioner has not sought a quashing of the decision made in relation to him based on X17.

Nullity

The learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that X17 is a nullity and as such is

automatically null and void without much ado, although it is sometimes convenient to have the

court to declare it to be so.

In Ashokan v. Commissioner of Notional Housing [(2003) 3 Sri.L.R. 179 at 183J and Leelowathie

and Another v. Commissioner of National Housing[(2004) 3 Sri.L.R. 175 at 179] where Sripavan

J. (as he was then) quotes with approval Lord Denning in Mcfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd. [(1961)

3 All E.R. 1169 at 1172J where he said "You cannot put something on nothing and expect it to

stay there, it will collapse" .

Page 7 of 11

However, in Ashokan v. Commissioner of National Housing (supra) the Petitioner specifically

sought a quashing of A9 which was the decision that was held to be a nullity. In Leelawathie

and Another v. Commissioner of National Housing (supra) Sripavan J. (as he was then) was not

confronted with a situation of futility arising from the absence of any relief sought against a

decision that was a nUllity.

It is apposite to briefly set out at this point the meaning of nullity in Administrative Law. Clive

Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th ed., South Asia Edition (2017) in discussing the

meaning of null and void in Administrative Law states (page 185):

"The primary concern here is the meaning of nullity or voidness solely in the context of

the remedies granted by courts. The concept of nullity has been used to solve other

problem arising in administrative law. For remedial purposes, the orthodox view is that

an ultra vires act is regarded as void and a nullity. An act by a public authority which

lacks legal authority is regarded as incapable of producing legal effects. Once its

illegality is established, and if the courts are prepared to grant a remedy, the act will

be regarded as void from its inception and retrospectively nullified in the sense that it

will be regarded as ever incapable of ever producing legal effects." (emphasis added)

Thus, even where an act of a public authority is ultra vires and a nullity, for remedial purposes

the illegality must be established before a court. As stated by Wade and Forsyth, Administrative

Law, 9th Ed., Indian Edition, 281:

"".the court will treat an administrative act or order invalid only if the right remedy is

sought by the right person in the right proceedings"

Prior to Mcfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd.(supra), this approach was reflected in the statement of

Lord Radcliffe in Smith v. East Elloe Rural District Council [(1956) A.C. 736, 769-770] where he

held:

"An order, even if not made in good faith is still an act capable of legal consequences. It

bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead . Unless the necessary proceedings are

taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity and to get it quashed or otherwise

Page 8 of 11

--I

upset, it will remain as effective for its ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of

orders."

In fact, Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law (supra page 305), states that the statement of

Lord Denning in Mcfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd.(supra) relied on by the Petitioner is not the

correct position in law.

Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law (supra) page 304, after restating the above statement of

Lord Radcliffe sets out the correct position as follows:

"This must be equally true even where the 'brand of invalidity' is plainly visible for there

also the order can effectively be resisted in law only by obtaining the decision of the

court. The necessity of recourse to the court has been pointed out repeatedly in the

House of Lords and Privy Council, without distinction between patent and latent

defects. Lord Diplock spoke still more clearly [Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. v. Secretary of

State for Trade & Industry (1975) A.C. 295 at 366], saying that

It leads to confusion to use such terms as 'voidable', 'voidable ab initio', 'void' or 'a

nullity' as descriptive of the status of subordinate legislation alleged to be ultra vires for

patent or for latent defects, before its validity has been pronounced on by a court of

competent jurisdiction." (Emphasis added)

This approach is consistent with the 'presumption of validity' according to which administrative

action is presumed to be valid unless or until it is set aside by a court [Hoffmann-La Roche and

Co. v. Secretary of State for Trade & Industry (1975) A.C. 295]. However, this 'presumption of

validity' exists pending a final decision by the court [Lord Hoffmann in R v. Wicks (1998) A.C. 92

at 115, Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 A.C. 143 at

156 and 161, and 173-4].

Page 9 of 11

This presumption applies to subordinate legislation as well. It is in this context that Lord Irvine

LC in Boddington v. British Transport Police [(1999) 2 A.C. 143 at 158] held:

"The Anisminic decision established, contrary to previous thinking that there might be

error of law within jurisdiction, that there was a single category of errors of law, all of

which rendered decision ultra vires. No distinction is to be drawn between a patent (or

substantive) error of law or a latent (procedural) error of law. An ultra vires act or

subordinate legislation is unlawful Simpliciter and, if the presumption in favour of its

legality is overcome by a litigant before a court of competent jurisdiction, is of no legal

effect whatsoever."

Accordingly, I reject the proposition of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that as X17 is a

nullity, there is no need for it to be set aside. Even if X17 is a nullity as alleged by the Petitioner,

the 'presumption of validity' applies and it is to be considered as valid until and unless its

legality is successfully challenged in appropriate proceedings.

Futility

Indeed, the Petitioner has sought a writ of certiorari to quash X17. Nonetheless, the Petitioner

has failed to pray for a writ of certiorari to quash the decision by which a higher duty was

charged from him in allowing him to clear the imported vehicle. Such a decision will be

reflected on the Customs Declaration presented by the Petitioner. In Weerasooriya v. The

Chairman, Natianal Hausing Development Autharity and Others [C.A. Application No. 866/98,

C.A.M. 08.03.2004] Sripavan J. (as he was then) held that the court will not set aside a

document unless it is specifically pleaded and identified in express language in the prayer to the

petition.

In these circumstances, even if Court issues a writ of certiorari to quash X17, the decision to

charge a higher sum as customs duties from the Petitioner will remain and as such it will be

futile to issue a writ of certiorari to quash X17.

Page 10 of 11

It is the same in relation to the charging of excise duty. The Petitioner admits that the alleged

excess excise duty has been collected from the Petitioner. Yet, he has not sought a writ of

certiorari quashing that decision. Instead, he has sought writs of mandamus and prohibition

which relate to enforcing a statutory or public duty and prohibiting a public functionary acting

ultra vires. But the alleged ultra vires act has been already committed by the customs by

recovering what is alleged to be excess excise duty. That decision must be quashed before

directing the customs to act according to law.

For all the foregoing reasons, I dismiss the application of the Petitioner without costs.
