Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner filed this application as public interest litigation

seeking to quash by certiorari the approval given by the 1st

Respondent Central Environmental Authority (P10B) to a mini

hydro power project proposed by the 7th Respondent in the

Koskulana river at Kalawana. In addition, the Petitioner seeks

mandamus (a) directing the 1st-6th Respondents to take

appropriate measures for restoration and/or reparation of the

location and its surrounding environment; and (b) directing the

5th and 6th Respondents not to renew the annual Permit of

occupation issued to the 7th Respondent.

In the first place, I must make the following general

observations.

This Court in the exercise of writ jurisdiction cannot decide on

administrative decisions where the facts involved are in dispute.

Simply stated, when major facts are in dispute writ will not lie.

4

It was held in Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board [1981] 2 Sri LR

471:

Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of

the facts is subject to controversy and it is necessary that

the questions should be canvassed in a suit where parties

would have ample opportunity of examining the witnesses

so that the Court would be better able to judge which

version is correct, a writ will not issue.

This was referred to with approval in the Supreme Court case of

Dr. Puvanendran v. Premasiri [2009] 2 Sri LR 107.

It is not the task of this Court in exercising writ jurisdiction to

consider whether the decision is right or wrong but whether the

decision is legal or illegal. Vide Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v.

Minister of Labour & Vocational Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at

248-249, Public Interest Law Foundation v. Central Environmental

Authority [2001] 3 Sri LR 330 at 334.

The writ Court is ill equipped to handle delicate specialised

subjects. Granting approval to a power project by the Central

Environmental Authority is one such specialised area.

In Public Interest Law Foundation v. Central Environmental

Authority [2001] 3 Sri LR 330, the Petitioner (who is the same

Petitioner in the instant application) sought to quash by

certiorari the decision of the Central Environmental Authority

approving the construction of the Southern Expressway on the

basis of failure to analyse or consider reasonable and

environmentally friendly alternatives, and that the

5

Environmental Impact Assessment Report did not provide proper

intelligible and adequate reasons for the rejection of alternatives

to the project. By refusing the application, this Court at 333

stated:

The Court is ill equipped, in any event, to form an opinion

on environmental matters-they being best left to people who

have specialised knowledge and skills in such spheres.

Even if a matter may seem to be preeminently one of public

law, the Courts may decline to exercise review because it is

felt that the matter is not justiciable, i.e. not suitable to

judicial determination. The reason for non-justiciability is

that Judges are not expert enough deal with the matter.

With this in the background, let me consider the Petitioners

application. The Petitioners case is predicated on the basis that

this mini hydro power project is in the Sinharaja forest reserve.

The Petitioner has dedicated 4 pages of the petition to

emphasise the importance of Sinharaja as a UNESCO World

Heritage site. All the Respondents including the Conservator

General of Forests and Director General of Sustainable Energy

Authority say otherwisethat the project is not in the Sinharaja

forest. There is no proper Plan tendered by the Petitioner to say

that the project is within the Sinharaja forest reserve except a

Map marked P5 allegedly depicting the Sinharaja World Heritage

site, on which learned counsel for the Petitioner, at the

argument, pointed with his pen to show, according to his guess,

where the project is located. To say the least, such an

irresponsible approach on the part of the Petitioner to challenge

the project approval marked P10B is outrageous against the

6

number of Plans and Maps tendered by the Respondents,

especially the 7th Respondent who is the project proponent. Vide

the Plans marked 7R16B, 7R16D, 7R17A, 7R17B, 7R17C, 7R19,

7R20 tendered with the statement of objections of the 7th

Respondent in addition to the Plans tendered with the limited

statement of objections. If I may highlight one, the Plan marked

7R16B is a Plan prepared by the Surveyor General, which proves

that the project is not in the Sinharaja forest reserve. The Plan

marked 7R20 also strongly supports the Respondents position.

The Conservator General of Forests and the Director General of

the Sustainable Energy Authority are very firm in their

positions. The Conservator General of Forests by tendering 4R1

says that P5, which is relied upon by the Petitioner and available

on the UNESCO World Heritage website, depicts both the forest

reserve and the proposed forest reserve of Sinharaja, and the

proposed forest reserve cannot be named as the Sinharaja forest

reserve. The Petitioner has not tendered any Plan countering

this position. This Court cannot decide whether the Petitioner

or the Respondents are correct on this issue. That is outside the

purview of this Court. When this main ground upon which the

Petitioners whole case is based is in dispute, can this case be

maintained? I think not. Nevertheless, I will consider the rest.

The main relief sought by the Petitioner concerns the Initial

Environmental Examination (IEE) Report marked P10A

submitted by the project proponent to the Central

Environmental Authority for the purpose of approval of the

project. Approval has been given by the Central Environmental

Authority by P10B.

7

The Petitioner has several concerns on P10A.

One concern is that the Central Environmental Authority should

have asked not for the IEE Report but for an Environmental

Impact Assessment (EIA) Report, which is more comprehensive.

There is no issue that it is the Project Approving Agency, the

Central Environmental Authority, which has the authority and

expertise to decide, in the given facts and circumstances of each

individual case, whether to call for an IEE Report or EIA Report.

This Court has no specialised knowledge to consider the

correctness or otherwise of that decision. The necessity of calling

for an EIA Report in this instance is set out by the Petitioner in

paragraph 28(e) of the petition in this manner:

Therefore an examination of irreversible and irretrievable

commitment of resources such as the irreversible adverse

impacts on Sinharaja representing as it were on of the

fragile and least resilient eco system in the world is best

carried out through an EIA process and not IEE.

Explaining further, the Petitioner in paragraph 28(g) states:

Taking all these concerns into consideration, projects that

have significant impacts such as the present project

impacting on the Sinharaja World Heritage Site as well as

the Koskulana River, ought to go through an EIA report

where all significant impacts can be scrutinized properly

and completely and where the public including external

experts get an opportunity to provide their feedback in

relation to the said report should they wish to do so.

8

Thus it is clear, according to the Petitioner, that an EIA Report is

essential because the project is in the Sinharaja forest.

However, as I have explained before, it has not been established

that the project is in the Sinharaja forest or Sinharaja World

Heritage site. Then there is no validity to the claim that an EIA

Report is essential for this mini hydro power project.

The Petitioner has mentioned Koskulana River in the said

paragraph to give weight to its cause. That is to say, a power

plant based on Koskulana River needs special attention. There

is no dispute this power project is centered on Koskulana River.

However, according to Gazette No. 1858/2 dated 17.04.2014

marked 8R2, Koskulana River has been declared an Energy

Development Area under section 12 of the Sri Lanka Sustainable

Energy Authority Act, No.35 of 2007. Vide also 7R15A and

7R15B tendered with the statement of objections of the 7th

Respondent. The 9th Respondent Sustainable Energy Authority

has approved the project and stated that the project is situated

within the energy development area gazetted in terms of the

Sustainable Energy Authority Act. Vide 7R15C and 7R15D.

As the long title of the Act states, the Sri Lanka Sustainable

Energy Authority Act was enacted inter alia to develop renewable

energy resources, to declare energy development areas, to

implement energy efficiency measures and conservation

programmes, to promote energy security, reliability and cost

effectiveness in energy delivery and information management.

The Petitioner does not challenge the decision in 8R2. Then can

the Petitioner maintain this action practically? I think not.

9

I reject the argument of the Petitioner that an EIA Report instead

of an IEE Report should have been called for by the Central

Environmental Authority in this instance.

Another concern of the Petitioner in relation to the IEE Report is

that it was not submitted within one and a half years from the

date of issue of the Terms of Reference (TOR).

The Petitioner has clung onto a printed part of the TOR annexed

to the IEE Report as Annex I which says This TOR is valid only

for one and half years from the date of issue. The IEE report

should be submitted within the validity period. The date of issue

of the TOR is not mentioned in Annex I but the Petitioner in

reference to some other documents says that it was not

submitted within time.

The Regulations made by the subject Minister under section

23CC read with section 32 of the National Environmental Act,

No. 47 of 1980, as amended, have been published in Gazette

No.772/22 dated 24.06.1993 marked 3R4. These Regulations do

not impose a time limit to submit the IEE Report.

The Petitioner has tendered an extract from the Central

Environmental Authority website marked P12 regarding another

issue, which I will advert to later.

Although the Petitioner did not refer to P12 on this issue, there

is a reference in P12 to the time limit within which the IEE/EIA

Report shall be tendered after the issuance of the TOR.

P12 says Time allowed for the PAA (Project Approving Agencies)

for Scoping (Determining the scope of the EIA/IEE study and

10

issuing of Terms of Reference) is 14 days for IEE and 30 days

for EIA. Then regarding time allowed for Preparation of the

EIA/IEE report, it says No time limit has been given since the

project proponent is responsible for this.

This means, there is no time limit to submit the IEE Report after

issuing the TOR.

The Petitioner cannot highlight one document and suppress

another on the same matter, especially when both documents

were tendered by it. The Petitioner shall act with uberrima fides

when seeking discretionary relief such as writ. Suppression or

misrepresentation of material facts warrants denial of a

discretionary remedy.

According to the Petitioner (as seen from paragraph 29(c) of the

petition), submission of the Report within the stipulated time is

important because with fragile eco system such as Sinharaja the

conditions and concerns keep changing and the validity period for

submission of an environmental assessment is not indefinite.

There again, the Petitioners argument is based on the

assumption that the project is in Sinharaja, which was

disproved by the Respondents with overwhelming documentary

evidence.

The Petitioner states that the IEE Report had been submitted

almost four years after the TOR. This goes to show that the IEE

Report was not prepared overnight but is a considered Report. If

it were produced within a short period of time, I am certain that

the Petitioner would have argued otherwise.

11

In any event, the time limit stated in Annex I to P10A cannot be

treated as mandatory, and failure to adhere to the time limit

shall not vitiate the Report.

It seems to me that the Petitioner is engaging in a fishing

expedition.

The main objection of the Petitioner to the IEE Report is found in

paragraph 29(d) of the petition. It reads as follows:

Further the said approval letter P10B indicates that the

said report had been submitted for evaluation on 5th

February 2013, and it had been approved the very next

day, i.e. 6th February 2013. The Petitioner states that the

CEA website itself indicates that 21 days are required for

the Technical Review of an IEE Report and 30 days for an

EIA Report. A copy of the relevant pages from the website

of the 1st Respondent is annexed hereto marked P12 and is

pleaded as part and partial of this Petition. In the event of

sensitive projects with complicated impacts the time for

consideration could be considerably more. However the

said present project had been submitted to the CEA on 5th

February 2013 and approved the very next day. In the

circumstances the Petitioner states that clearly a full

evaluation of the impacts could not have taken place.

In short, what the Petitioner states is that the Central

Environmental Authority approved the IEE Report the very next

day after its submission, which is procedurally and

substantively wrong. The Petitioner states that a full evaluation

of the impact could not have taken place in one day, and

12

suggests that the Central Environmental Authority should have

taken 21 days for approval. This is the main argument of the

Petitioner against the Central Environmental Authority approval

marked P10B, which is sought to be quashed in these

proceedings. That is the main relief sought.

In my view, the argument of the Petitioner in the petition that

21 days are required for the Technical Review of an IEE Report

is a misleading statement. It presupposes that the Authority

must take 21 days to assess the IEE Report. This is not so.

The Petitioner has referred to P12 to convince his assertion.

P12an extract from the Central Environmental Authority

websitesays The time allowed for the PAA (Project Approving

Agencies) for Technical review is 21 days for IEE and 30 days

for EIA. This does not say nor can it be taken to mean that

technical review of the IEE Report shall mandatorily take 21

days. P12 gives the maximum time limit to complete the task.

It can be in one day or any day within 21 days.

Here again, in my view, the time stipulated is not mandatory but

given for the benefit of the project proponent in order for him to

plan out his project. If the technical review were to take more

than 21 days, that would not invalidate the whole process which

culminates in granting or refusing approval by the Central

Environmental Authority.

What is stated in the website is a simplified version of the

Regulations made by the Minister under the National

Environmental Act marked 3R4. Learned counsel for the

Petitioner drew the attention of the Court to Regulation No.9.

13

This Regulation in its original form clearly fortifies my view. It

says the Project Approving Agency shall within a period of [21

days] either grant or refuse to grant approval. The operative

word is within.

The 1st-3rd Respondents in paragraph 11 of their statement of

objections and the 7th Respondent in paragraph 6 of its

statement of objections have given their account of events. The

Director General of the Central Environmental Authority in his

corresponding affidavit states: P10A is the final version of the

IEE and not the first; upon being informed to tender a draft IEE

Report by letter dated 17.03.2009 marked 3R1, the 7th

Respondent had submitted the first draft on 28.09.2008 (3E2);

after evaluation, the 7th Respondent tendered the second draft

IEE Report on 14.11.2012 (3R3); thereafter the final IEE Report

(P10A) was tendered on 05.02.2013. There is no reason to

disbelieve what the Director General of the Central

Environmental Authority says in this regard.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner during the course of the

argument stated that no independent assessment can take

place within one day. Let me pose this question: Can an IEE

Report be independently assessed within 21 days? Given the

intricacies involved in that process, it cannot. It is not like

writing a report at the office. It is a practical environmental

assessment as opposed to a theoretical one. To my mind, the

21-day ceiling is predominantly, but not necessarily, for formal

final approval because by that time several interim reports

tendered by the project proponent would have been considered

by the Authority. The fact that it is a formality is clear by page

14

49 of P10A, where it is seen that the Report was submitted to

the Authority not by the experts who prepared it but by the

project proponent who has no expertise to prepare the Report.

At the argument, it was submitted on behalf of the Petitioner

that the letter of the Ceylon Electricity Board dated 21.11.2012

attached to the IEE Report P10A belies the 7th Respondents

assertion in paragraph 6 of the statement of objections that the

final IEE Report was tendered on 14.11.2012, and the Managing

Director of the 7th Respondent signed P10A on 05.02.2013 as a

formality, as required by the Central Environmental Authority.

Whatever the 7th Respondent has stated in paragraph 6, the fact

remains that the final IEE Report was signed on 05.02.2013.

The said letter of the Ceylon Electricity Board is dated prior to

that date. I see nothing suspicious or mischievous there.

The Petitioner is clutching at straws.

For the aforesaid reasons it is abundantly clear that this Court

cannot quash by certiorari the approval given by the Central

Environmental Authority marked P10B.

In addition, the Petitioner has sought to direct the 5th and 6th

Respondents by mandamus not to renew the annual Permit

issued in the name of the 7th Respondent marked 5R3 and

7R16A.

These annual Permits refer to a Surveyor Generals Plan No.

R/KLW/2013/574. This Plan has been marked 7R16B. By this

Plan it is clear that the land in respect of which the annual

Permit has been issued is not a forest reserve but a land

15

inhabited by villages. I see no compelling reason to issue

mandamus preventing issuance of annual Permits subject to

conditions, for otherwise the 7th Respondent will not be able to

proceed with the project.

The Petitioner also seeks to direct the 1st-6th Respondents by

mandamus to take appropriate measures for restoration and/or

reparation of the location and its surrounding environment.

This need does not arise in view of the aforesaid findings.

The Petitioner finally seeks an order compelling the 1st-3rd

Respondents to develop process guidelines for the identification

of projects that require approval in terms of the IEE and EIA

procedure. This Court has no mandate to do that.

Public interest litigation is a hallowed concept. Nevertheless,

public interest litigation shall not be converted to public

vexatious litigation. Frivolous and vexatious applications cost

the judiciary and Government agencies dearly. Such

applications inter alia impede the efficacy of the Courts by

detracting from the limited time and resources available to

devote to cases which legitimately deserve attention. Public

interest litigation shall be a boon not a bane.

The Petitioner cannot succeed in this application. In my view,

the Petitioners application is vexatious.

I dismiss the application of the Petitioner with costs.
