The Petitioner states that in 2003, the 5th Respondent had complained to the

1st Respondent that the Petitioner had obstructed the Indivinna Ahasdiyawela

Ela in the following manner:

The 3rd Respondent, who was the Agrarian Development Officer for Welpalla,

had inquired into the said complaint, and arrived at a finding in favour of the

5th Respondent. The Petitioner had thereafter challenged the said decision in

the Provincial High Court of Kurunegala, but his application had been rejected

for failure to comply with the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules,

1990. The Petitioner had thereafter filed a revision application before this

Court CA/PHC/Rev No. 109/2006. This Court had set aside the judgment of

1 Vide letter dated 4th March 2009, marked X1b.

3

the Provincial High Court, as well as that of the 3rd Respondent, on the basis

that the provisions of the Agrarian Development Act No. 46 of 2000, as

amended (the Act) required the inquiry to be conducted by an Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Development, whereas the 3rd Respondent was only

an Agrarian Development Officer.

By letters dated 4th March 2009 and 28th October 2009, marked X1a and X1b

respectively, the 5th Respondent had requested the 1st Respondent to re-

inquire into the complaint made by him in 2003 regarding the obstruction of

the said Ela by the Petitioner.

The power to inquire into complaints relating to obstruction of irrigation

channels, water courses etc is contained in Section 83(1) of the Act, which

reads as follows:

The Commissioner-General may, if it appears to him that any person has:

(a) blocked up, obstructed or encroached upon or caused to be blocked

up, obstructed or encroached upon, damaged or caused to be

damaged, any irrigation channel, water course, bund, bank,

reservation tank, dam, tank-reach or irrigation reserve: or

(b) wilfully or maliciously caused the waste of water conserved in any

irrigation work: or

(c) without the prior written approval of the Commissioner-General

carried out any cultivation in, or removed earth from or caused earth

to be removed from, a tank, canal within the catchment area or from

a minor irrigation channel, water course, bund, bank, reservation

tank, dam, tank-reach or irrigation reserve,

4

make an order requiring such person to take such remedial measures as

are specified in the order.

The 2nd Respondent, an Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Development had

accordingly conducted an inquiry with the participation of the Petitioner and

the 5th Respondent. Having afforded all parties an opportunity of presenting

evidence, and filing written submissions, the 2nd Respondent, by an Order

dated 31st May 2013, marked X6 had held that the Petitioner had obstructed

the Ela. The said decision had been communicated by the 2nd Respondent to

the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent, by letter dated 31st May 2013 marked

X7. The Petitioner had also been directed by X7 to remove the obstruction

caused to the said Ela.

Dissatisfied by X6, the Petitioner had filed this application, seeking a Writ of

Certiorari to quash:

(a) the Order made by the 2nd Respondent, marked X6;

(b) the proceedings of the Inquiry conducted by the 2nd Respondent,

pursuant to which the above decision was arrived at.

Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service2

has identified three grounds upon which administrative action is subject to

control by judicial review, namely 'illegality', 'irrationality' and 'procedural

impropriety'. The Petitioner is not complaining that the Order X6 is illegal, nor

is the Petitioner complaining that the 2nd Respondent has not followed the

proper procedure. The complaint of the Petitioner is that the 2nd Respondent

2 1985 AC 374.

5

has acted on extraneous considerations and that the findings of the 2nd

Respondent are not supported by the evidence led before the 2nd Respondent.

However, neither the petition nor the written submissions of the Petitioner

contain any elaboration of the above complaints.

This Court is mindful that in an application for judicial review, this Court is

exercising its Writ jurisdiction as opposed to its Appellate jurisdiction. This

distinction has been referred to in Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth3

in the following manner:

"The system of judicial review is radically different from the system of

appeals. When hearing an appeal the court is concerned with the merits of

a decision: is it correct? When subjecting some administrative act or order

to judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality: is it within the

limits of the powers granted? On an appeal the question is right or

wrong?' On review the question is lawful or unlawful?

As Lord Brightman stated in the House of Lords in Chief Constable of North

Wales Police v Evans4, applications for judicial review are often misconceived:

Judicial review is concerned, not with the decision, but with the decision

making process. Unless that restriction on the power of the court is

observed, the court will in my view, under the guise of preventing the

abuse of power, be itself guilty of usurping power..... Judicial review, as

the words imply, is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the

manner in which the decision was made.

3 H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, Administrative Law (11th Edition), Oxford University at page 26. 4 [1982] 1 WLR 1155 at 1174.

The only issue that this Court is required to consider is whether the decision of

the 2nd Respondent that the Petitioner has obstructed the said Ela is supported

by the material that was placed before the 2nd Respondent. This Court, having

examined the evidence that was led before the 2nd Respondent, notes the

following facts:

a) The 5th Respondent had purchased a property situated in Welpalla,

Indivinna in extent of 4A 0R 2P.

b) The said property is depicted as Lot Nos. 4, 5 and 6 of Plan No. 201/1983

dated 27th October 1983.

c) While Lot Nos. 4 and 5 are contiguous lots of land, Lot No. 5 is a paddy

field.

d) Situated on the northern boundary of Lot Nos. 4 and 5 is Lot Nos. 2 and 3.

e) Situated between Lot No. 4 and Lot No. 2 is the disputed Ela. Thus, the

said Ela separated the Lot No. 4 owned by the 5th Respondent from Lot

No. 2.

f) It was the position of the 5th Respondent that he uses water from the said

Ela to cultivate his paddy land Lot No. 5.

g) The complaint of the 5th Respondent was that in 2002, the Petitioner,

whose land is situated to the north of Lot No.4, had filled the Ela with

earth and obstructed the Ela that runs between Lot Nos. 2 and 4 and

brings water to Lot No. 5, and thereafter fenced his land, and erected a

wall.

7

h) The Petitioner had in fact complained that during the rainy season, the

said Ela overflows on to his land, and pollutes his well, which is situated

adjacent to the Ela.

i) The 5th Respondent is alleging that in erecting a fence, the Petitioner had

encroached onto his land.

j) The 5th Respondent had thereafter instituted Case No. 13903/L in the

District Court of Kuliyapitiya, seeking inter alia a declaration that the 5th

Respondent is the owner of the land that he is alleging the Petitioner has

encroached.

k) Plan No. 3913 had been prepared in August 2004 pursuant to a

commission issued in the said case depicting the said Lot Nos. 4, 5 and 6

in Plan No. 201/1983, as Lot Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.

l) Lot No. 4 in Plan No. 3913 is part of Lot No. 4 in Plan No. 201/1983.

m) However, the disputed Ela which is depicted to the North of Lot No. 4 in

Plan No. 201/1983 is not depicted in Plan No. 3913, as an Ela did not exist

by 2004, due to the filling of the Ela.

It is on the above material that the 2nd Respondent had concluded that there

existed an Ela between Lot Nos. 2 and 4 of Plan No. 201/1983, and that by the

absence of the Ela in Plan No. 3913 prepared in 2004, it was clear that the said

Ela had been filled with earth by the Petitioner, as alleged by the 5th

Respondent. This Court is therefore satisfied that the decision of the 2nd

Respondent marked X6 is supported by the material that was placed before

8

the 2nd Respondent. It is not a decision which is so absurd that no sensible

person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority,5

There is one other matter that this Court wishes to advert to. The Petitioner

had annexed to his written submissions a copy of the judgment delivered by

the learned District Judge of Kuliyapitiya in the aforementioned case, where he

too, had arrived at a finding similar to X6 with regard to the obstruction of

the Ela.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to grant the

relief prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
