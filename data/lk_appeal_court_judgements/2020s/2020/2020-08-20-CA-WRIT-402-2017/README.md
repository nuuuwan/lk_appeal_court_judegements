Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

This application arises from the Order marked P13 made by the 1st

Respondent, the Condominium Management Authority directing the Petitioner

inter alia to carry out certain constructions at premises bearing assessment No.

9/2, Ebert Place, Colombo 5 in order to comply with the Condominium Plan

marked P3 relating to the said premises.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows.

It is agreed between the parties that the building situated on the said premises

consists of three floors, and that the said building, which was constructed by

the Petitioners father as a single house, was subsequently converted to a

condominium property. It is also agreed by all parties that the said building

now consists of the following residential units:

Assessment No. Floor Unit No. Owned by

9/2 Ground 1 Petitioners wife 9/2 1/1 First 2 Petitioner 9/2 1/2 First 3 Sister of the 5th Respondent 9/2 2/1 Second 4 Petitioner 9/2 2/2 Second 5 5th Respondent, subject to the life interest of the 6th and 7th Respondents The Petitioner states that by letter dated 1st November 2011 marked P5, he

made a complaint to the then General Manager of the 1st Respondent alleging

inter alia that the 5th 7th Respondents have erected unauthorized

constructions in the said Condominium property contrary to the Approved

Building Plan and the Condominium Plan. While a copy of the Approved

4

Building Plan has been marked P2,1 a copy of the Condominium Plan has been

marked P3. Acting on the said complaint, a Technical Inspector of the 1st

Respondent had inspected the said premises on 16th February 2012.

Pursuant to a similar complaint made by the Petitioner to the 8th Respondent -

the Colombo Municipal Council - the officers of the Planning Division of the 8th

Respondent had also inspected the said premises on 2nd April 2012. By a letter

dated 14th May 2012 marked X8 annexed to P9,2 the 8th Respondent, while

directing the 5th 7th Respondents to remove certain unauthorised

constructions, had directed the Petitioner to:

(a) Restore the window marked W4 in the bedroom of Unit No. 4 situated

on the wall adjoining the area marked as open terrace, as depicted in

P2; and

(b) Demolish the wall that had been erected across the open terrace area

between the said bedroom and the end of the building.

The Petitioner states that he duly complied with the latter part of the said

directive by removing the said wall, only to be informed by the 8th Respondent,

by its letter dated 31st May 2012 marked X9 annexed to P9, not to act on

X8, and to await the decision of the 1st Respondent.

The 1st Respondent had conducted an inquiry in respect of the aforementioned

complaint of the Petitioner marked P5, with the participation of the

Petitioner and the 5th Respondent. The 4th Respondent, who was the Inquiry

1 P2 is in fact an amendment to the original building plan approved by the Colombo Municipal Council. 2 P9 has been filed with the further affidavit of the Petitioner dated 12th February 2018.

5

Officer3 had afforded the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent an opportunity of

placing evidence with regard to the illegal constructions that are said to have

taken place, as well as an opportunity of filing written submissions. The

Petitioner has no complaint with regard to the procedure that was followed by

the Inquiry Officer, nor is there any complaint with regard to the hearing

afforded to the Petitioner.

The Inquiry Officer had thereafter submitted his report dated 28th September

2017 marked P18 to the 1st Respondent, and by letter dated 28th November

2017, marked P13, the 3rd Respondent who was the General Manager of the

1st Respondent at that time, had informed the Petitioner, inter alia as follows:

a) The Petitioner should re-construct at his cost, the wall that existed

between the open areas marked CE8 and CE9 on page 5 of the

Condominium Plan P3 vide P13a;

b) Open spaces shall be created at the top of the said wall to serve as

ventilation openings vide P13b;

c) The Petitioner shall reconstruct the opening of the wall that was

demolished by the Petitioner to fix the window marked W4 vide P13c.

It is observed that P13 contains several other directions relating to the said

premises including directions given to the 5th Respondent to demolish certain

other unauthorised constructions at the said premises.

Dissatisfied by the said decision, the Petitioner filed this application, seeking

Writs of Certiorari to quash each of the said directives marked P13a, P13b

and P13c. 3 The inquiry had commenced before a different Inquiry Officer. The parties had however agreed to the appointment of the 4th Respondent and to proceed with the Inquiry having adopted the evidence led before the previous Inquiry Officer.

6

The Roman Dutch Law principle, expressed by the maxim superfices solo cedit

essentially provides that an owner of the land is the owner of any buildings

situated on it. Thus, when a land is transferred, any building standing on the

land would automatically be transferred with the land. With the introduction

of the Condominium Property Act No. 12 of 1970, it was possible to acquire an

interest over a condominium unit, which formed a part of a multi storey

building. This act was repealed and replaced by the Apartment Ownership Law

No. 11 of 1973, which has subsequently been amended by the Apartment

Ownership (Amendment) Act No. 45 of 1982, the Apartment Ownership

(Special Provisions) Act No. 4 of 1999, and the Apartment Ownership

(Amendment) Act No. 39 of 2003 (the Act).

Before considering the two arguments placed before this Court by the learned

Counsel for the Petitioner, it would be useful to record the background to the

dispute between the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent that culminated in the

complaint by the Petitioner and the aforementioned order of the 1st

Respondent. The starting point of this discussion is the admission by the

Petitioner that the said premises was owned by the Petitioners father, and

that the property was initially a residential house.4 While this Court has not

been apprised as to when the construction took place, and a copy of the

approved building plan for the house has not been filed of record, it appears

from the caption of the Plan marked P2 i.e. Proposed Amendment to

Approved Plan No. ME/PBK/899/80 - that the Building Plan for the house that

was built by the Petitioners father had been approved in 1980.

This Court has examined P2 and observes the following:

4 Paragraph 8 of the affidavit filed by the Petitioner in CA (Writ) Application No. 187/2010 vide page 76 of the documents annexed to the further affidavit of the Petitioner dated 12th February 2018.

7

a) The second floor plan, shown on the extreme right of P2 sets out the

two units that are relevant to this application;

b) Between the said units is an area described as an open terrace;

c) The southern wall of the bedroom in Unit No. 4 that is relevant to this

application is adjacent to the open terrace;

d) The said bedroom has a window marked W4 which opens into the said

open terrace;

e) The kitchen of Unit No. 4 and the dining hall of Unit No. 5 opens into the

said open terrace, and face each other;

f) P2 has been approved by the 8th Respondent on 10th August 1987.

The Petitioner then goes onto state that the said residential house was later

converted into a condominium property. At the time of conversion, numerous

windows and doors were closed in order to ensure privacy of each of the units.5

While this Court has not been apprised of the windows that were closed, or

when the window in question was removed and the space created by the

removal covered with brick and mortar, what is important is the reason for the

closure of certain selected windows i.e. to ensure the privacy of each of the

units, especially since any person looking through the window of the

aforementioned bedroom in Unit No. 4 has a direct and unobstructed view

into the dining room of Unit No. 5, and vice versa.

The Petitioner has produced marked P3 Condominium Plan No. 3280A dated

11th March 1989 prepared by A.F.Sameer, Licensed Surveyor, which sets out 5 Ibid.

8

the amendments that were effected at the time of conversion to a

condominium property. This Court has examined P3 and observes the

following:

a) Unit Nos. 4 and 5, which are the two units that are the subject matter of

this application, have been set out in page 5;

b) The open terrace area in P2 has been divided into two separate areas,

which have been referred to as CE8, and CE9;

c) The endorsement, CE8 and CE9 for exclusive use of Units 4 and 5

respectively appears on P3;

d) While the doors and windows of the two Units have not been set out in

P3, the boundaries of each Unit and the internal areas of each Unit has

been shown by a straight line;

e) A straight line (which is the continuation of the boundary of the bedroom

which is relevant to this application) has been drawn separating CE8

from CE9;

f) P3 has been approved by the 8th Respondent on 12th June 1989.

It would thus be seen that the amended Approved Building Plan marked P2 is

different to the Condominium Plan marked P3 in respect of at least two

matters - the first is that the window in the bedroom bordering the open

terrace area shown in P2 is not there in P3. The second is that the open

terrace shown in P2 has been divided into two areas in P3, and depicted as

CE8, and CE9.

9

This Court must note two important matters at this point. The first is that the

Condominium Plan P3 has been approved by the Colombo Municipal Council,

which also approved P2. The second is that the said changes effected to P2,

as reflected in P3 compliments the admission that alterations were effected

to enable the conversion of the single house to a condominium property by the

Petitioners father.

There is no dispute that the Condominium Deed of Declaration dated 11th

February 1991 marked P4 has been prepared based on P3. This position is in

fact borne out by the following paragraph in P4:

(3) AND WHEREAS in terms of the provisions of the said Apartment

Ownership Law No. 11 of 1973 as amended by Apartment Ownership

(Amendment) Act No. 45 of 1982 the buildings standing on the said

allotment of land and premises marked Lot 1F on the said Plan No. C/28

dated 9th May 1950 made by R. Piyasena Perera Licensed Surveyor in the

said Schedule hereto firstly fully described formed a Condominium

Property and the Declarants caused the said Condominium Property to be

depicted as Units 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 with common elements in Condominium

Plan No. 3280A dated 4th March 1989 made by A.F. Sameer Licensed

Surveyor in the said Schedule hereto fully described.

This Court must note that all subsequent Deeds relating to one or more of the

Units of P3 vide X4, X5, X6 of P9 have been executed by reference to

P3, and in terms of the details of the units provided in P3. Although the

Deeds of Transfer by which the 5th Respondent purchased Unit No. 5 has not

been produced, it is not in dispute that the 5th Respondent purchased Unit No.

5 from the Petitioners father/ Petitioner after P3 was approved by the 8th

Respondent in 1989, and presumably on the strength of P3.

10

It is in the above background that the Petitioner submitted his complaint P5

to the 1st Respondent alleging that the 5th 7th Respondents have erected

unauthorized constructions in the said Condominium property contrary to the

Approved Building Plan and the Condominium Plan. These unauthorised

constructions related to the closure of the window W4, the erection of a wall

which served as a physical separation of the open terrace into CE8 and CE9,

and several other constructions, which are not relevant to this application. The

position taken up by the 5th Respondent was that whatever the modifications

that had been carried out in the said premises had been done prior to her

purchasing the said premises, and that she has not carried out any

modifications.

Having examined the report of the Inquiry Officer marked P18, this Court

observes that the reasons for the aforementioned recommendations of the

Inquiry Officer is as follows:

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner presented two arguments before this

Court. The basis for the first argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner

is that the plan that prevails is the Approved Building Plan marked P2, and not

the Condominium Plan marked P3, and therefore, the directions given by the

1st Respondent by P13 which was to comply with the plan as depicted in P3

are contrary to the law, and therefore illegal.6 The response of the learned

Solicitor General appearing for the 1st 4th Respondents, and the learned

Counsel for the 5th 7th Respondents was that the Plan that prevails is the

Condominium Plan P3, and that the directives marked P13a P13c are in

accordance with the provisions of the Condominium Plan marked P3, and are

within the law.

Having identified illegality as one of the grounds on which a decision of an

administrative body could be subjected to judicial review, Lord Diplock in

Council of Civil Service Unions vs Minister for the Civil Service7 described

illegality as follows:

By illegality as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-

maker must understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-

6 As P2 and P3 have been approved prior to the amendments made to the Act in 1999 and 2003, this Court would have to consider the first argument in the context of the law that existed at the time P2 and P3 were approved. 7 1985 AC 374.

13

making power and must give effect to it. Whether he has or not is par

excellence a justiciable question to be decided, in the event of dispute, by

those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the state is

exercisable.

As stated in De Smiths Judicial Review8:

The task for the courts in evaluating whether a decision is illegal is

essentially one of construing the content and scope of the instrument

conferring the duty or power upon the decision-maker. The courts when

exercising this power or construction are enforcing the rule of law, by

requiring administrative bodies to act within the four corners of their

powers or duties.

The issue that this Court must therefore consider is which of the two plans was

the 1st Respondent required to enforce, with the answer deciding whether the

1st Respondent acted illegally.

In terms of Section 3(1) of the Act, Any person claiming to be an owner of any

Condominium Property may make application to the Registrar for the

registration of a Plan of the Condominium Property (hereinafter referred to as

"Condominium Plan"). The reference to Registrar is to the Registrar of

Lands appointed under the Registration of Documents Ordinance and having

jurisdiction over the registration district in which the Condominium Property is

situated.9

8Harry Woolf, Jeffery Jowell, Catherine Donnelly, Ivan Hare, De Smiths Judicial Review (8th Edition, 2018), Sweet and Maxwell, p245-246. 9 Vide Section 26 of the Apartment Ownership Law.

14

Section 5(1) of the Act provides as follows:

The Condominium Plan shall comprise-

(i) a survey plan or plans which shall be prepared and drawn by a licensed

surveyor or by or under the authority of the Surveyor-General and shall

(a) delineate the external surface boundaries and boundary marks of

the proposed Condominium Property and the position of each

subdivided building thereon fixed in relation to the surface

boundaries;

(c) include a vertical section of each subdivided building showing-

(i) the floors and ceilings of each storey; and (ii) the height of each storey;

(d) include a description, as well as the vertical section and

dimensions, of each building or parts thereof proposed to be

erected within the Condominium Property as a separate tenement

or an extension of any completed subdivided building, in

accordance with building plans and subdivision plans approved

by the authority for the time being responsible for the approval

of such plans;

(e) delineate, subject to the provisions of subsections (IA) and (IB),

each proposed unit and define the boundaries thereof by reference

to floors and walls showing the horizontal dimensions, without it

being necessary to show any bearing;

15

(i) delineate the external boundaries and show the horizontal

dimensions without it being necessary to show any bearing of

each building or parts thereof proposed to be erected within the

Condominium Property as a separate element or an extension of

any completed subdivided building or buildings in accordance with

building plans (if any) and subdivided plans approved by the

authority for the time being responsible for the approval of such

plans;

(j) define the common elements of the Condominium Property; and

(l) have attached to it a certificate of a qualified architect or a

qualified civil or structural engineer to the effect that the units

shown therein are the same as those existing on the

Condominium Property;10

In terms of Section 5(2) of the Act, A Condominium Plan tendered for

registration shall be accompanied by a certificate from the local authority to

the effect that the division of the building into units as illustrated in the Plan is

in accord with its by-laws and regulations.

Section 5(4) of the Act provides as follows:

No plan lodged as a Condominium Plan shall be registered unless

(a) the plan has been endorsed with a certificate of a licensed surveyor

that all buildings and all units shown in the Condominium Plan in

relation to the external surface boundaries of the Condominium

Property are within the Condominium Property and are in compliance

10 Sub-paragraphs (b), (f), (g), (h) and (k) of Section 5(1)(i) are not relevant and have not been re-produced.

16

with building plans (if any) and subdivision plans issued by the

authority for the time being responsible for the approval of such

plans;

(b) the plan is accompanied by a copy of the relevant Condominium

subdivision plan approved by the authority for the time being

responsible for the approval of such plan;

(c) ....

While in terms of Section 7A(1) of the Act, The Condominium Plan shall be

deemed to be registered under the provisions of this Law when the

Condominium Plan has been signed and sealed by the Registrar and has been

marked with the serial number of the Condominium Plan register, Section 9(3)

provides that, Upon registration of a Condominium Plan, each unit depicted

therein together with the common elements appurtenant thereto shall be

deemed to be absolutely owned by the person or persons described in the Plan

as the owner or owners of the Condominium Property .....

Taking into consideration the above provisions of the Act, it is the view of this

Court that the Condominium Plan is based on the Building Plan approved by

the local authority, and that there cannot be any inconsistency or contradiction

between the Condominium Plan and the Approved Building Plan. The fact of

the matter however is that there are differences between P2 and P3, which

differences could probably be attributed to the fact that approval was initially

granted to a house, and the necessity for a Condominium Plan arose only

because of the application of the Petitioner father to convert the said

premises to a Condominium Property.

17

What is significant however is fact that:

(a) The building that should be situated on the said premises should be the

building that is depicted in P3;

(b) P3 is later in time, and has superseded P2;

(c) P3 too has been approved by the 8th Respondent, the Colombo

Municipal Council.

Even where the decision of the 1st Respondent is within the purported four

corners of the Act, Courts can still intervene where the decision is irrational or

where it was reached in an improper manner. Although Courts are now moving

towards using a less tortuous test for irrationality11, this Court is of the view

that the facts and circumstances of this case and the manner in which the 1st

Respondent had arrived at the decisions contained in P13(a) (c), cannot be

considered as conduct which no sensible authority acting with due

appreciation of its responsibilities would have decided to adopt.12

In these circumstances, it is the view of this Court that:

(a) The Condominium Plan P3 shall prevail over P2;

(b) The 1st Respondent acted within the four corners of the law when it

decided to act in terms of P3, and therefore the aforementioned

decision of the 1st Respondent marked P13a P13c is neither illegal nor

irrational;

11See Colonel U.R Abeyratne v. Lt. Gen. N.U.M.M.W. Senanayake and Others - CA (Writ) Application No. 239/17; CA Minutes of 7th February 2020. 12Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Metropolitan Borough Council of Tameside [1977] AC 1014.

18

(c) The first argument advanced on behalf of the Petitioner is misconceived,

both in fact and in law.

The second argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

powers vested in the 1st Respondent by the Condominium Management

Authority Act No. 10 of 1973, as amended (the CMA Act) is limited to securing

compliance with the Development Permit issued by the Urban Development

Authority and the Approved Building Plan, and that the 1st Respondent does

not have the power to make directions which are contrary to the Approved

Building Plan.

Section 9A(1) of the CMA Act reads as follows:

Where the Authority receives a complaint or receives information that an

unauthorized construction has been erected or is being erected in any

registered or unregistered Condominium Properly or Semi Condominium

Property, the Authority shall cause a notice in writing to be served on the

owner of the condominium parcel and a copy of such notice to be served

on each occupier of such condominium parcel and the management

corporation if any, who is erecting or has erected such unauthorized

construction in the condominium parcel, or the common element and

direct such owner, occupier or management corporation, as the case may

be, to be present at an inquiry on a date, time and place, to be specified in

the notice and to show cause

(a) why the Authority should not prohibit such person from proceeding

with the construction;

(b) why the unauthorized construction should not be demolished and

the Condominium Parcel restored to its original condition.

19

Section 9A(2) of the CMA Act sets out that after an inquiry, the 1st Respondent

may direct an owner or occupier:

(a) not to proceed with such unauthorized construction; or

b) to restore the condominium parcel or an accessory parcel

appurtenant to the condominium parcel or common element to its

original condition ; or

(c) to take such other measures for the purpose of compliance with the

conditions set out in the permit subject to which the Condominium

Property or Semi Condominium Properly has been constructed.

"Unauthorized construction" has been defined in Section 27 of the CMA Act to

mean, any improvement or alteration to the condominium parcel or ancillary

parcel appurtenant to such condominium parcel, any improvement or

alteration to the common elements, any parceling or subdivision of the land

parcel where the Condominium Property or Semi condominium Property is

constructed, the erection or re-erection of sub structures and the construction

of works on the land parcel where the Condominium Property or Semi

Condominium Property is constructed, carrying out of building, engineering and

other operations on over or under such land parcel, or any change in the use for

which the land parcel or any building or any structure thereof is used, without

a valid permit from the authority who have been empowered by law to

approve the building plan, or contrary to any term or condition set out in the

permit issued in respect of the building plan approved for the relevant

Condominium Property or semi Condominium Property.

20

The argument of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner was that given the

above definition, a construction amounts to an unauthorised construction only

if it is done without a valid permit from the authority that has been

empowered by law to approve the building plan.13 He submitted further that

as the aforementioned window W4 has been shown in P2, and as there is no

wall separating CE8 from CE9 in the Approved Building Plan P2, the 1st

Respondent cannot direct the Petitioner to act contrary to the said Approved

Building Plan.

This Court, while reiterating the reasons given earlier as to why P3, which has

been approved by the Colombo Municipal Council must prevail, is of the view

that the Petitioner must comply with P3. If the Petitioner wishes to act

outside P3, he must obtain a valid permit to do so from the Colombo

Municipal Council, and the approval of the 1st Respondent. Any construction

outside of P3 is illegal and would come within the above definition of

unauthorised construction. Hence, this Court does not see any merit in the

second argument of the Petitioner.

Before concluding, there is one matter that this Court must advert to. The

Petitioner was fully aware that the said window had been removed at the time

the house was converted to a condominium property, and that the open area

between Unit Nos. 4 and 5 had been separated into two lots referred to as

CE8 and CE9 and allocated for the exclusive use of Unit Nos. 4 and 5,

respectively. The Petitioner was fully aware (a) that the Condominium Plan P3

reflecting these changes was prepared at the request of the Petitioners father;

(b) that P3 was approved by the Colombo Municipal Council; and (c) that

carrying out the said changes was a precondition to seeking approval for the

Condominium Plan P3. Furthermore, the Petitioner could not have been

unaware that Unit Nos. 3 and 5 were based on P3 at the time the said

premises were sold. Yet, the Petitioner chose to come before this Court and

argue that P2 prevails over P3. This is not the conduct that this Court would

expect from a litigant seeking a discretionary remedy.

In Fernando, Conservator General of Forests and two others vs. Timberlake

International Pvt. Ltd. and another14, the Supreme Court, having held that the

conduct of an applicant seeking Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus is of great

relevance because such Writs, being prerogative remedies, are not issued as of

right, and are dependent on the discretion of Court, stated that, It is trite law

that any person invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal

for obtaining prerogative relief, has a duty to show uberrimae fides or ultimate

good faith,....

As observed by the Supreme Court in Namunukula Plantations Limited vs

Minister of Lands and Others,15 If any party invoking the discretionary

jurisdiction of a court of law is found wanting in the discharge of its duty to

disclose all material facts, or is shown to have attempted to pollute the pure

stream of justice, the Court not only has the right but a duty to deny relief to

such person.

For the aforementioned reasons, this Court is of the view that the duty of good

faith commences prior to the institution of action, and that the Petitioner has

not come before this Court with clean hands. This application is liable to be

dismissed on this ground alone.

Taking into consideration all of the above facts, this Court is of the view that

the Petitioner is not entitled to the relief prayed for. This application is

accordingly dismissed.
