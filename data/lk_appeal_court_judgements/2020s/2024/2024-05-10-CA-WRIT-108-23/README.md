Facts relevant to this case

According to the Petitioner following facts are revealed in the Petition.

Petitioner is attached to the Sri Lankan Volunteer Force of the Sri Lankan Army, who

was attached as a Volunteer Cadet on 06.07.2007 and promoted to 2nd Lieutenant on

10.04.2012.

After completing 3 years in the rank of Lieutenant and after completing the exam in 2012

he was promoted to the rank of Temporary Captain with effect from 20.12.2014. On

31.10.2015 the villages has complained to the police that, he has come out from the camp

under the influence of liquor and had a quarrel with the civilians. Court of Inquiry was

held on 01.11.2015 and a charge sheet was served on him containing 3 charges. After he

pleaded guilty on 20.09.2016, he was awarded severe reprimand as the punishment for

all the charges.

By the document marked P7, the 1st Respondent has taken a decision that it is not

necessary to take further action against the Petitioner in respect of the same incident.

According to the Petitioner, he has completed the Captain to Major Exam in 2016. Due to

the punishment he was not promoted in 2017. According to the Petitioner he has to wait

for 1 year to get the promotion. From the year 2017 to 2019 though he has received

confirmation for the promotion he was not promoted. In the year of 2020 he was

recommended for promotion but his promotion was denied. In 01.08.2020 the Petitioner

Page 6 of 11

was informed by the letter P17 that the 1st Respondent declined the Petitioners request

on the basis that, the Petitioner has committed an offence that amounts to more on moral

turpitude. According to him, this was the first time he was informed by the Authority

concerned.

Against that Order, he has made several appeals to the 1st Respondent by way of redress

of grievance. In the meantime, in 2021 and 2022 his Commanding Officer recommended

for his promotion. Thereafter, he has requested the right of the audience with the 4th

Respondent and no action has been taken. By the document marked P33 he was informed

by the 1st Respondent that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have considered the gravity of the

offence committed by the Petitioner on 31.10.2015 and have declined his promotion.

According to the Petitioner, he has satisfied all the criteria for the confirmation in the

rank of captain with effect from 20.12.2014. But the Respondent has taken the position

that the petitioner is not eligible under circular No. AO/11/2019 which was tendered by

the 1st Respondent in their objection. The Respondent in their Objection has taken the

position that, according to the army order No. AO/11/2019 dated 27.06.2019 it sets out the

promotion and career progression criteria of the Sri Lankan Army Lieutenant Colonel and

below which was marked as R1. According to the paragraph 53 of the said order, it

stipulates that The Officers who have punished for civil-military offences, which amount

to Moral Turpitude are not to be considered.

The question before us is whether the Respondents decision not to promote the Petitioner

considering the circular AO/11/2019?

According to the Petition, is to be promoted to the rank of temporary major and to promote

to the rank of major, as he has completed the major exam in 2016 in terms of regulation

15/01 of the regulation which was marked as P9. Also, the officers who have sat for the

exam with the Petitioner they have been placed in temporary major effect from

30.12.2018.

In the objections the Respondent has taken the position that due to the Army Order which

was marked by the Respondent as R1, where the Officer who has been punished for civil

offences which amounted to moral turpitude to be considered for the promotion. But when

we peruse the charge sheet which was marked as P6 where the offence was committed on

31.10.2015, the offence was never indicated in the said charge sheet. When the

Respondents framed the charges against him, the particular offence was not there at the

Page 7 of 11

time the incident took place. They have described 3 charges in the particular charge sheet

and described the offences as follows;

1. Neglect to obey garrison or other orders

2. Prejudicial to military discipline

3. Conduct prejudicial to military discipline

Those three charges are based on, whilst the Petitioner was performing duties as an

officer commanding of A coy of 5th volunteer battalion of Sri Lanka Light infantry,

consumed liquor in the living room and left the camp through the security fence without

obtaining the permission from the superior and entered into a civil house. By doing that,

he committed an offence punishable under sections 102(1) and 129 (1) of the Army Act No

17 of 1949 which was in force at that time. But the Respondent has deprived his promotion

by stating that the petitioner who has been punish for civil/ military offences which

amount to moral turpitude, which disqualifies his promotion. The Petitioner right to be

promoted as a Major, was deprived by imposing a condition that was circulated by

AO/11/2019 that was not an offence at that time. Whether the particular offence will have

the retrospective effect when the incident occurred. We hold that P17 and P33 where

Respondents consider the incident comes under Moral turpitude which was not an offence

at that time of the offence committed is irrational. There is no evidence to show that, the

Respondent has the power to make regulations under and in terms of the Army Act with

retrospective effect where decision contained in P33 is based on the said circular.

This concept was discussed in Dr. K.M.L.Rathnakumara and 13 Others v. The

Postgraduate Institute of Medicine and Others , SC Appeal NO: 16/2014, decided on

30.03.2016, (2016 BLR Vol.XXII page 92 at page 98; Priyantha Jayawardhena, PC.,J.,

held;

Section 17 of the Interpretation Ordinance stipulates the General provisions with respect

to power given to any authority to make rules, regulations, and by-laws.

Thorntons Legislative Drafting at page 424 says Delegated legislation may have

retrospective effect only if the primary legislation containing the delegation either has

that effect or authorities the delegated legislation to have that effect. no statute or

order is to be construed as having a retrospective operation unless such a construction

appears very clearly or by necessary and distinct implication in the Act. This principle

Page 8 of 11

was adapted by Sharvananda J. in the case of the Attorney General of Ceylon and W.M.

Fernando, Honorary Secretary, Galle Gymkhana Club 79 (1) NLR 39.

Constitutional and Administrative Law of Sri Lanka by joseph A.L. Cooray at page 329

says The doctrine that subordinate legislation is invalid if it is ultra vires is based on

the principle that subordinate agency has no power to legislate other than such as may

have expressly been conferred by the supreme Legislature. Subordinate legislation is

fundamentally of a derivative nature and must be exercised within the periphery of the

power conferred by the enabling Act. For example, subordinate legislation having

retrospective effect is ultra vires unless the enabling Act expressly or by necessary

implication authorizes the making of retrospective subordinate legislation.

At page 323 of the said book states Unless Parliament has in the enabling or parent Act

expressly or impliedly authorized the sub-delegation, the maxim delegatus non potest

delegare applies to make the sub delegation unlawful.

There is no provision available in the said act to delegate power to the 1st Respondent to

make regulations with retrospective effect. When there is no power to the 1st Respondent

to make regulation with retrospective effect, the decisions containing in P17 and P33 are

ultra vires.

Be that as it may, the Petitioner was continuously applying for the rank of major from

2016. We are mindful that in 2018, 2020, 2021 and 2022 after satisfying all the necessary

and requisite criteria for the rank of captain and also in 2016 after completing the captain

to major exam where the Petitioners batch was confirmed in the rank of captain on or

about 09.02.2017 in the view of the disciplinary circular he was lawfully eligible for the

promotion on 20.09.2017. According to the Petitioner, as per the annual confidential

report marked as P 11-C he was duly recommended to be promoted. Some Officers of the

Petitioners batch confirmed the substantive rank of captain. According to the P 13A, P

13B he was duly recommended by the commanding officer. He has made an appeal for not

being promoted.

Under the terms of the said regulation of the Sri Lankan Army ( Volunteer Force and

Volunteer Reserve) Regulation 1985, he was expecting that, he will be eligible to be

promoted to the rank of temporary major by 20.12.2018 and by 20.12.2022 he will be able

to be promoted to the rank of major by 20.12.2022. Whereas the Officers from his intake

Page 9 of 11

who have sat for the said exam have now confirmed the rank of captain and placed in the

rank of temporary major in 2018.

Failure to promote him and failure to consider his appeal violates his rights and due

entitlement. The only defence taken by the Respondent was that according to P17 and

P33 that the Petitioner has committed an offence of moral turpitude. Where we have

already held that the particular offence was not indicated in the charge sheet. If the 1st

Respondent considered his promotion in the due process he would have been appointed as

temporary major in 2018. He had a legitimate expectation that he would be promoted

after completing 3 years as a captain.

Halsvurys Laws of England, 5th Edition, Volume 61, Page 694.

Legitimate expectations.

A person may have a legitimate expectation of being treated in a certain way by an

administrative authority even though there is no other legal basis upon which he could

claim such treatment. The expectation may arise either from a representation or promise

made by the authority, including an implied representation, or from consistent past

practice. In all instances the expectation arises by reason of the conduct of the decision-

makers, and is protected by the courts on the basis that principles of fairness,

predictability and certainty should not be disregarded.

The existence of a legitimate expectation may have a number of different consequences;

it may give standing to seek permission to apply for judicial review, it may mean that the

authority ought not to act so as to defeat the consequence of the expectation without some

overriding reason of public policy to justify its doing so, or it may mean that, if the

authority proposes to act contrary to the legitimate expectation, it must afford the person

either an opportunity to make representations on the matter, or the benefit of some other

requirement of procedural fairness. A legitimate expectation may cease to exist either

because its significance has come to a natural end or because of action on the part of the

decision-maker.

In appropriate circumstances the existence of a legitimate expectation may require a

public body to confer a substantive, as opposed to a procedural, benefit. In such cases the

courts will not permit the public body to resile from the representation if to do so would

amount to an abuse of power.

I like to refer the observation made in Perera v. National Police Commission and 24

Others, SC (FR) Application No. 290/2006, Decided on 03.07.2007, 2007 BLR 14 at page

17 Shirani A. Bandaranayake,J held as she was then:

Examining the decisions in Schmidt (supra) and Attorney- General for New South Wales

v. Quin [(1990) 170 C.L.R 1], P. P. Craig (Legitimate Expectations, A Conceptual Analysis,

L.Q.R. [(1992) 108 pg. 79] had observed the applicability of the concept of legitimate

expectation in administrative decisions and had stated that,

"The foundation of the applicant's procedural rights is not simply that he has some

legitimate expectation of natural justice or fairness. The basis of the applicant's claim to

protection is that he has a legitimate expectation of an ultimate benefit which is in all the

circumstances felt to warrant the protection of that procedure, in his instance his

continued presence in the country."

Thus it is apparent that, as observed by David Foules (supra), a promise or a regular

procedure could give rise to a legitimate expectation that could be enforced by court. This

position is clearly illustrated by the decisions in Attorney General of Hong Kong vs. Ng

Tuen Shiu [(1983) 2 AU.E.R. 346] and Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the

Civil Service [(1984) 3 All E.R. 935}.

According to the Petitioner, he was eligible for promotion after 20.09.2017. He was duly

recommended to be promoted as Captain. But the decision of the 1st Respondent stating

that he is not eligible to be promoted for the position of captain as he has committed an

offence namely moral turpitude which was ultra vires.

Considering the above facts we hold that the decision taken by the 1st Respondent in P17

and P33 are ultra vires. Therefore we quash both the decisions according to the prayer

(c) and (e) of the petition. Although in his prayer he has asked for a writ of mandamus

directing the 1st respondent to confirm the Petitioner in the rank of captain with effect

from 20.12.2014. But in his petition, he admits in paragraphs 17 and 18 that due to the

punishment, he lost the opportunity of being considered for promotion for one year from

effect till 20.09.2017. Therefore there is confusion with regards to his promotion date.

Therefore we direct the 1st Respondent to consider his promotion to the rank of Captain

with effect from 20.12.2017. Thereafter if he is eligible for the rank of Temporary Major

under the said circular recommend him to that post.
