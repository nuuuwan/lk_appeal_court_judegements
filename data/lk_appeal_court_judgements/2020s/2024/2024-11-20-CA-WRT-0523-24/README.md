The Attorney General served the indictment marked P1 to Nadun Chinthaka

Wickramaratne alias Harakkata who is the Petitioner of the instant Application and two

others. The Petitioner is being kept in the custody of the authorities of the Counter Terrorism

and Investigation Division (CTID) at the old prison in Tangalle in terms of an order under

section 15A (1) of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No.48 of 1979

(PTA), marked P2, issued by the 2nd Respondent - Secretary to the Ministry of Defence.

The Petitioner primarily seeks a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari quashing the

said indictment P1 and the said detention order marked P2.

The Petitioner primarily argues that the Attorney General has issued an indictment

prematurely, based on incomplete investigations, and therefore, no valid indictment exists

before the relevant High Court. The Petitioner points out that when the indictment was filed,

12 suspects were involved in the Magistrates Court Case No. B/27181/23, but only three,

including the Petitioner, were named in the impugned indictment. Citing the 'B Report dated

28.02.2024, the Petitioner highlights that investigations into several telephone numbers were

still ongoing at the time. Additionally, the Attorney General, through a letter dated

22.03.2024, discharged the 2nd, 6th, 8th, 9th, 11th and 12th suspects from the Magistrates Court

Case. The Petitioner expresses concerns about the lack of reference to the remaining four

suspects from the Magistrates Court Case, arguing that the status of investigations concerning

these suspects is crucial to the validity of the impugned indictment. The Petitioner contends

that the failure to include these suspects undermines and invalidates the indictment and the

related proceedings.

The Petitioner further highlights that during proceedings before the High Court, the State

Counsel informed the Court that all investigations have been concluded. However, on

03.07.2024, the High Court Judge noted difficulties in getting the main docket of the

Magistrates Court Case forwarded due to the purported ongoing investigations. The

Petitioner contends that once an indictment is filed in the High Court, the Magistrates Court

Page 4 of 15

no longer has jurisdiction to investigate the same matter. Furthermore, the Petitioner asserts

that a High Court case can only be initiated through an indictment after the prosecution has

fully completed its investigations. The Petitioner points to paragraph 18 of the 1st

Respondents Limited Statement of Objections which state that two additional suspects may

be included based on further investigations. The Petitioner contends that it is the Prosecution's

responsibility to identify the accused, clear any relevant suspects, and prepare a complete list

of witnesses before filing an indictment.

In response, the Respondents, citing Sections 173 and 180 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act No. 15 of 1979 (CCPA), argue that the Attorney General has the discretion to either try

the accused jointly or conduct separate trials for each accused. They assert that the three

accused currently facing trial under the impugned indictment will be prosecuted based solely

on the investigative material available at the time the indictment was filed. Furthermore, the

Respondents maintain that such material was deemed sufficient and admissible to

substantiate the charges against those three accused.

The Respondents argue that the impugned indictment is founded on the premise that the three

accused named therein acted in collusion as part of a conspiracy on the date of the incident,

justifying their joint inclusion in the indictment. They assert that any new evidence that has

since emerged does not impact the Attorney Generals decision to indict the three accused

under the existing charges. Furthermore, the Respondents contend that the involvement of

another individual aiding or abetting the offenses committed by the current accused does not

invalidate the impugned indictment.

Contemporaneously, the Petitioner argues that the charges outlined in the indictment fall

under Section 315 of the Penal Code and do not meet the criteria for applying the provisions

of the PTA, which require a minimum punishment of no less than 7 years imprisonment. The

Petitioner reiterates that they have not committed any act falling under the PTA's preamble,

rendering its application against them a violation of the law. In response, the Respondents

maintain that this claim should be examined during the trial in the High Court. The

Respondents further allege that the Petitioner attempted to murder an STF guard by attacking

him, which they argue qualifies as an act of violence falling within the scope of the PTA.

Page 5 of 15

Contrary to the Petitioners submissions regarding the applicability of the PTA to the charges

of hurt (), the Respondents argue that the term has been used in the

impugned indictment in compliance with Section 164 of the CCPA. Under Section 164(2) of

the CCPA, if the law defining an offense assigns it a specific name, the offense may be referred

to by that name alone in the charge.

Prosecutorial Discretion

On an overall conspectus of the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner, it appears that

the arguments of the Petitioner seem to center on challenging the prosecutorial discretion

exercised by the Attorney General in filing the impugned indictment against him. The learned

Counsel for the Petitioner, relying heavily on the guidelines formulated in the judgment of

this Court in Sandresh Ravindra Karunanayake v. Hon. Attorney General and Others

CA/WRIT/441/2021 decided on 28.02.2023, submitted that the Attorney General has failed

to exercise his prosecutorial discretion lawfully. It is important to note that the learned Deputy

Solicitor General who appears for the Respondents also relied on the aforesaid judgement.

When arriving at the final determination in the said Sandresh Ravindra Karunanayake case, I

have examined, among several other cases, the judgements in the cases of B. Sirisena Cooray

v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and Two others 1999 1 Sri. L.R. 1, Land Reform Commission v.

Grand Central Limited (1981) 1 Sri. L.R. 250, The Attorney General v. Sivapragasam et al, 60

NLR 468, Victor Ivon v. Sarath N. Silva, Attorney General and others (1998) 1 Sri. L.R. 340;

Victor Ivan and others v. Hon. Sarath N. Silva and others (2001) 1 Sri. L.R. 309, Centre for Policy

Alternatives v. B. N. Jayarathne and others, SC/FR Application/23/2013, SC minutes

24.03.2014, Kaluhath Ananda Sarath De Abrew v. Chanaka Iddamalgoda and others, SC/FR No.

424/2015, SC minutes of 11.01.2015, Janaka Bandara Tennakoon v. Attorney General,

CA/Writ/335/2016 decided on 20.11.2020 (CA), and Dassanayake Mudiyanselage Deepal

Pushpa Kumara v. Hon. Attorney General and others, CA/WRIT/291/2022 dated 27.01.2023.

Moreover, I have followed the principles enunciated in the above judgments in subsequent

decisions of this Court, such as in Saroja Govindasamy Naganathan alias Maharachchige

Sarojani Perera and others v. Hon. Attorney General and Wasantha Kumara Jayadewa

Karannagoda, CA/WRIT/424/21 decided on 10.11.2021; and Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon v.

Page 6 of 15

Hon. Attorney General, Inspector General of Police, Ajith Nivard Cabral and others, CA

/WRIT/417/2021 decided on 03.11.2021.

Even the learned Deputy Solicitor General placing reliance on the judgment of the said

Sandresh Ravindra Karunanayake case submitted that none of the grounds of the Petitioner

that challenge the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General would fall within the

guidelines enunciated in the said Sandresh Ravindra Karunanayake case. Thus, I take the view

that the issues in the instant Application on the said indictment can be effectively addressed

by applying the guidelines established by the Court of Appeal in the referenced case to assess

whether the Attorney General exercised prosecutorial discretion lawfully and without malice.

A party could challenge the decision of the Attorney General to forward an indictment if such

decision falls within any of the limbs of the criteria enunciated therein.

Therefore, the following guidelines formulated in the said Sandresh Ravindra Karunanayake

case, in my view, are fit and proper to be applied in assessing such prosecutorial discretion of

the Attorney General in the instant Application;

1. Whether mere objective of leading evidence for the prosecution in the trial court is

not for the purpose of establishing the ingredients of the charge against the accused

2. Whether leading evidence for the prosecution in the trial court;

i. cannot establish the ingredients of the charge due to any restrictions of a

written law,

ii. will not be sufficient for the Trial Judge to efficaciously and adequately

determine any primary issue with mixed facts and law or an issue of law.

3. Applicability of the No Evidence Rule in exceptional circumstances.

4. If the Attorney General has taken a decision assuming a jurisdiction which he

doesnt have or exceeding his jurisdiction.

5. If the Attorney General has taken a decision exercising his prosecutorial discretion

in bad faith/ mala fide or with ulterior motive or with political motivation.

Page 7 of 15

6. The decision would amount to an abuse of process.

7. Procedural irregularity or existence of any illegality during the decision-making

process.

8. If there is a clear miscarriage of justice.

The above first guideline deals with the purpose of prosecution evidence and accordingly, the

evidence presented in court by the Attorney General should aim to establish the elements of

the charge against the accused. There is no allegation by the Petitioner against evidence led

by the prosecution. It is observed that the trial in the High Court is still at its pre-trial

stage. Secondly, the guidelines assess whether any limitations of prosecution evidence exist.

Evidence may fail to establish the charge if a.) such evidence is restricted by written law and

b.) insufficient for the trial judge to determine key legal or factual issues effectively. However,

the Petitioner has not raised any such objection against the evidence to render this Court to

consider the applicability of the second guideline.

The above third guideline deals with the No Evidence Rule which needs to be applied only

under specific, exceptional circumstances. No submissions either orally or in writing have

been made on behalf of the Petitioner upon the non-availability of evidence on the aforesaid

Rule, vitiating the institution of proceedings in the High Court against the Petitioner.

The decisions of the Attorney General may be challenged if he exceeds his jurisdiction or

lacks authority according to the fourth guideline set out above. I am convinced with the stand

taken by the Respondents that the Attorney General's discretion under Sections 173 and 180

of the CCPA to determine the structure of the trial, whether jointly or separately, is based on

the evidence available at the time of the indictment. I am inclined to accept the submissions

of the Respondents that the charges against the three accused are substantiated by admissible

investigative material that supports the allegations of acting in collusion as part of a

conspiracy on the date of the incident. I am of the view that the subsequent emergence of new

evidence or the involvement of additional accused does not undermine the validity of the

impugned indictment or its basis. This position reinforces the submissions made on behalf of

Page 8 of 15

the Respondents and eventually, the Petitioners argument on a premature indictment cannot

be sustained.

The mentioned fifth guideline concerns the decisions influenced by bad faith/mala fide,

ulterior motives, or political bias. It is well observed that the Petitioner has submitted to Court

only a mere plea of mala fide against the Attorney General without a clear legal basis. I have

decided in S. H. S. Padmini v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Others CA/WRIT/478/2021

decided on 09.11.2022 that the plea of mala fides should be substantiated with adequate proof

to the satisfaction of Court and merely raising a doubt would not be sufficient. The assertions

on mala fide should be specific, direct and precise in order to sustain the plea of mala fides.

In this regard, Sripavan J. in Bandaranayake vs. Judicial Service Commission (2003) 3 Sri. L.R.

101 has followed the following contents in Principles of Administrative Law by Jain & Jain,

4th Edition 1988 (at p. 564);

"The plea of mala fides is raised often but it is only rarely it can be substantiated to the satisfaction

of Court. Merely raising doubt is not enough. There should be something specific, direct and

precise to sustain the plea of mala fides. The burden of proving mala fides is on the individual

making allegation as the order is regular on its face and there is a presumption in favour of the

administration that it exercises its power in good faith and for the public benefit."

If the Attorney Generals decision amounts to an abuse of due process of court, then such a

decision is unacceptable according to the above sixth guideline. Maintaining fairness,

equality, and impartiality in legal proceedings is vital to preserving the integrity of the legal

system and safeguarding individual rights. The misuse of judicial processes has far-reaching

consequences extending beyond legal contexts to undermine societal trust and the

foundations of justice. Additionally, it exacerbates inequalities by privileging those with

power or resources while marginalizing vulnerable groups, deepening societal disparities and

undermining the principles of Natural Justice. Anyhow, the Petitioner has not addressed any

of the main elements of the said concept of the abuse of the process of the court to benefit

from such a notion.

The seventh and the eighth guidelines focus on the procedural or legal flaws and the

miscarriage of justice. The decisions made by the Attorney General with procedural

Page 9 of 15

irregularities or illegality can be contested whilst any decision resulting in a clear injustice

warrants intervention. It is noted that the Petitioner has not substantiated his assertions on

the miscarriage of justice to the satisfaction of this Court. I am reluctant to accept the

submissions of the Petitioner on the charges outlined in the indictment, that such charges do

not meet the threshold for invoking the PTA, emphasizing that the alleged actions of the

accused fall under Section 315 of the Penal Code and do not align with the PTA's

requirements or its preamble. When assaying the totality of the submissions of the

Respondents, I am inclined to accept the position that the Petitioner's claims regarding the

PTA's applicability should be addressed during the High Court trial. The Respondents have

justified that the use of the term in the indictment, complies with Section 164 of the

CCPA, which permits offenses to be referred to by their specifically assigned legal names. The

issues relating to the applicability of the PTA need to be subjected to judicial scrutiny during

the trial in the High Court as this Review Court, based on the circumstances of this case,

should not act as a trial judge. This is due to the reason that I am unable to find any ground

which is eminently unreasonable or is guilty of an illegality in challenging the related decisions

of the Attorney General.

I take the view that applying these guidelines established in the instant case will facilitate a

fair and just assessment of the impugned indictment. For the reasons set forth above, I take

the view that the Petitioner has failed to convince this Court with sufficient material that the

decisions or actions of the Attorney General have not aligned with the Rule of Law; not

remained within the bounds of his jurisdiction; and are not free from mala fide, ulterior

motives or political influence. No substantive evidence was tendered to Court by the

Petitioner to demonstrate that the decision of the Attorney General to serve the impugned

indictment amounts to procedural irregularities, abuse of process and any miscarriage of

justice. In conclusion, I have no reason to disregard the submissions made by the learned

Deputy Solicitor General made contrary to the submissions of the Petitioner.

Detention Order

In addition to challenging the indictment, the Petitioner seeks an order in the nature of a writ

of Certiorari quashing the detention order marked P2. The said relief sought by the Petitioner

Page 10 of 15

is only supported by a mere assertion that the detention orders under section 15A of PTA are

permitted only when there is a valid indictment. The contention of the Petitioner is that no

valid detention order can be issued under the said section if the respective indictment is void

ab initio. Thus, based on the reasons given above to disregard the arguments of the Petitioners

challenging the indictment, no further examination is required to consider whether the

impugned detention order is invalid.

Anyhow, the submissions of the Petitioner in this regard suffer from several flaws. This Court

has constantly decided that judicial review should only be sought where there is a clear and

blatant error in the discretion of the impugned decision including the decision-making process

or when the authorities have acted beyond their jurisdiction. The term blatant should be

interpreted according to Rules of the Court and other written laws. Such interpretation cannot

be confined to a meaning given in a linguistics Dictionary. Hence, the Petitioner has not

satisfied this Court that there exists a blatant error in law in respect of the impugned detention

order.

Res Judicata/ Estoppel

The Respondents urge that the instant Application of the Petitioner be dismissed in limine

because a previous application bearing No. CA/WRIT/225/2024 seeking the same reliefs

was withdrawn. The said writ Application No. CA/WRIT/225/2024 has been filed by the

father of the Petitioner of the instant Application. The Respondents contend that the conduct

of the Petitioner amounts to an abuse of process as he had his father file the earlier Application

and subsequently withdraw it.

Now I must examine the reliefs sought in the instant Application as well as in the said

Application No. CA/WRIT/225/2024. It is observed that the primary reliefs in the said case

CA/WRIT/225/2024 set out in paragraph (c), (d), (e), in its prayer are as follows;

c.) For a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the indictment "P1" and/or the

decisions contained therein and/or the proceedings commenced thereupon in HC/4834/24;

d.) For a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the Order "P2" and/or the

decisions contained therein;

Page 11 of 15

e.) For a mandate in the nature of a writ of mandamus directing the 3rd and/or 4th Respondent

to cause to produce the Petitioner's son Nadun Chinthaka Wickramaratne in a competent court

of law for further steps to be taken according to law and to enable a judicial order to be made

according to law concerning his custody;

The Petitioner in the instant Application in paragraph (g),(h),(i),(j) in the prayer of the

Petition seeks the following primary reliefs;

g) Grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Indictment marked P1

dated 06-03-2024 filled by the 1st Respondent for offenses purportedly committed under the

Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 (as amended) and/or the

decisions contained therein and/or the proceedings commenced thereupon in the Case bearing

No. HC/4834/24 in the High Court of Colombo;

h) Grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Detention Order marked

"P2" dated 11-03-2024 issued by the 2nd Respondent and/or the decisions contained therein;

i) Grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st and/or 3rd and/or

4th Respondents from bringing charges under and in terms of the provisions of the Prevention of

Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, No. 48 of 1979 (as amended) against the Petitioner;

j) Grant a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 3rd and/or 4th and/or 5th

Respondents to cause to produce the Petitioner in a competent court of law for further steps to be

taken according to law and to enable a judicial order to be made according to law concerning his

custody;

The documents mentioned in paragraphs (c) and (d) of the prayer in

CA/WRIT/225/2024, marked as P1 and P2, are the same as those referenced in

paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of the prayer in the current Application. These documents,

namely the indictment and the detention order, are the contested items attached to both

Applications. It is undisputed that CA/WRIT/225/2024 was filed by the father of the current

Petitioner on his behalf, as explicitly stated in paragraph 4 of the earlier Petition. Similarly,

in paragraph 44 of the current Petition, the Petitioner acknowledges that his father previously

invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court on the same matter. Both Applications were filed

Page 12 of 15

during the period of detention under the detention order marked P2 and after the filing of

the contested indictment marked P1. The earlier Application, CA/WRIT/225/2024, was

unconditionally withdrawn by the respective Petitioner on 25.07.2024, citing a change in

circumstances as the reason for withdrawal.

On a careful perusal of the contents of the two Petitions stated above, I have no doubt that

the main reliefs prayed for in both the Applications are identical. Therefore, I need to examine

whether the doctrine of Res Judicata should be applied in the instant Application.

Applicability of the said doctrine, even to Review Applications, has been warranted by

Review Judges in many previous judgements. The Respondents argue that the withdrawal of

the previous Application was entirely free of any condition and as such the conduct of the

Petitioner amounts to an abuse of process of court upon which the instant Application should

be dismissed.

The Respondents relied on the judgement in Jayawardena and Five Others v. Dehiattakandiya

Multi Purpose Co-Operative Society Ltd. and Fifty Others [1995] 2 Sri L.R 276 which was a writ

application dismissed by the Court of Appeal, considering the withdrawal of a previous

application filed by one of the Petitioners. Sarath N. Silva J. (P/CA) (as he was then) has held

in the said case that the contents of Rule 47 of the Supreme Court Rules 1978 and Rule 3(2)

of Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 appear to be based on the doctrine of

Res Judicata. He further held that Rule 3(2), which requires a petition to include an assertion

that the jurisdiction of this Court has not previously been invoked regarding the same matter,

clearly implies that a party may not institute fresh proceedings on the same matter once a

prior application has been concluded. However, Silva J. has examined whether the

withdrawal of the first application was done based on an arrangement or an agreement that

was intimated to Court at the time of withdrawal. Finally, the Court has dismissed the said

Application of the 1st Petitioner assuming that the withdrawal was unconditional as the court

was not apprised of any arrangement or agreement based on which the previous application

was withdrawn.

In Nigamuni Piyuji Rasanja Mendis Supipi v. The University of Kelaniya CA/WRIT/90/2021

decided on 02.08.2023, I have observed that;

Page 13 of 15

Res judicata takes two distinct forms: issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel. In

brief terms, issue estoppel prevents a litigant from raising an issue that has already been

decided in a previous proceeding.1 Cause of action estoppel prevents a litigant from

pursuing a matter that was or should have been the subject of a previous proceeding.2

If the technical requirements of issue estoppel or cause of action estoppel are not met,

it may be possible to invoke the doctrine of abuse of process to prevent relitigation of

matters3 (Vide- 'What is Settled is Settled: the Doctrine of Res Judicata' by Maurice

Mirosolin, Pacific Law Group, <https://pacificlaw.ca/cased-closed-doctrine-of-res-

judicata/> (accessed 31 July 2023))

I wish to borrow the information illustrated by the author in the said Law Blog by the

Pacific Law Group in arriving at a conclusion in the instant Application. The said

author discussed further the aspects on abuse of process of court stating that; Judges

have an inherent and residual discretion to prevent an abuse of the courts process.

The concept of abuse of the process of court including Res Judicata, Estoppel, Rule

Against Collateral Attack and Waiver can be identified as vital elements of the umbrella

concept known as Functus Officio. In dealing with the concept of Functus Officio it should

be noted that it aims to achieve finality whilst ensuring the conclusion of judicial proceedings.

Although I am inclined to adopt, in the instant case, the dicta advanced by Sarath N. Silva J.

(P/CA) (as he was then) in the above case of Jayawardena and Five Others, I strongly believe

that the modernized version of the doctrine of Functus Officio should be followed to address,

particularly, the gross injustices caused to a party in a case when it is necessary. This is because

of the enduring tension in the legal system: the need for finality vs. the imperative of fairness.

As such, this commitment to fairness continues to shape the evolution of Functus Officio in

modern legal frameworks. The review Courts should adopt the doctrine of Functus Officio

based on the circumstances of each case, bearing in mind the importance of fostering a legal

system that responds to the changing demands of justice, avoiding strict adherence to

1 Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79 23 SCC 63. 2 Erschbamer v. Wallster, 2013 BCCA 76. See also Henderson v. Henderson (1843), 3 Hare 100, 67 E.R. 313 at 319. 3 R. v. Power, 1994 CanLII 126 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601, at p. 616), and as oppressive treatment: R. v. Conway, 1989 CanLII 66 (SCC), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659, at p. 1667.

Page 14 of 15

procedural formalities that could lead to unfair outcomes. As Lord Atkin4 aptly stated,

"finality is a good thing, but justice is better." Therefore, the pursuit of finality may sometimes

need to give way to the higher goal of achieving justice.

Nevertheless, I take the view that, filling a fresh writ application by the Petitioner soon after

withdrawing the earlier application on the same issues or the cause of action is a clear instance

of issue estoppel or cause of action estoppel. Likewise, the Petitioner's conduct in twice

invoking the inherent jurisdiction of this Court cannot be justified as the Court is fully aware

of the specific circumstances surrounding the withdrawal of the previous application and the

submission of the new application to this same Court. In my view, such conduct of the

Petitioner amounts to abuse of process. In light of the reasons given above and based on the

circumstances of this case, I am unable to ascertain any gross injustice caused to the Petitioner

for this Court to uphold the imperative of fairness while disregarding the need for finality.

Conclusion

For the reasons adduced above, this case does not bear the ideal magnitude to overlook the

doctrine of Functus Officio as the Petitioner has failed to establish that a gross injustice will

be caused to him if the second writ application is not allowed. Implementing measures to

prevent practices like forum shopping and bench hunting is essential for maintaining the rule

of law and sustaining public confidence in the judiciary. Furthermore, exploiting the judicial

system for ulterior motives threatens the integrity of justice and democracy, weakening public

trust and jeopardizing the judiciary's role as a cornerstone of society. The instant Application

could have been refused solely by adopting the umbrella concept of Functus Officio.

However, this Court has taken an additional burden for completeness to consider the element

of prosecutorial discretion.

The judicial process concerning judicial review must be approached with responsibility and

should not be misused by filing Review Applications without merit. Judicial review,

especially in respect to challenging the prosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General,

should only be sought where there is a clear and blatant error in the discretion of the decision-

4 In Ras Behari Lal v King Emperor, [1933] ALL ER Rep 723 at 726, 50 TLR 1.

Page 15 of 15

making process or when the Attorney General has acted beyond his jurisdiction. This should

be assayed and evaluated while giving due consideration to the guidelines discussed above.

In the circumstances, I am unable to hold that the Attorney General in exercising his

discretion acted in bad faith or with an ulterior motive or in excess of his powers. Thus, I take

the view that there is no reason to interfere with the prosecutorial discretion exercised by the

Attorney General in relation to the impugned indictment or the detention order issued by the

2nd Respondent. I strongly believe that all the purported allegations raised against the Attorney

General by the Petitioner can be easily dealt with during the proceedings in the High Court,

if the Petitioner so wishes, as no intervention of a Review Court is required at this stage to

review any such contentions of the Petitioner.

This Court has consistently dealt with arguability principles in applications for judicial review

and held that the vitiating ground must be arguably material to the impugned decision and

such decision must be arguably amenable to judicial review. Thus, I hold that there is no

arguable case or a prima facie case which warrants this Court to issue formal notice of the

instant Application on the Respondents. Therefore, I refuse the instant Application.

Application is refused.
