S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner in this Writ Application is the recipient of the Permit dated 08.08.1998

marked as P1 in respect of the subject land in the extent of 0.087 Hectares, issued under

Section 19(2) of the Land Development Ordinance, No. 19 of 1935 (as amended) (the

Ordinance). The Petitioner, her husband, her parents and siblings were in occupation of

two houses that were constructed in the said land and later on, one house was rented

out by the younger sister of the Petitioner, the 2nd Respondent. On or about 2018, the

Petitioner got to know that the house was leased by the 2nd Respondent by executing a

notarial lease (P2) without the consent of the Petitioner. She made several complaints

3

to the Police (P3(a) to P3(c)) and the Divisional Secretary, Wattala, the 3rd Respondent

(letter dated 24.04.2018 marked as P4) in that regard. The Petitioner received a letter

dated 14.08.2018 marked as P7 issued by the 3rd Respondent informing her to come for

an inquiry to be held on 27.08.2018. Pursuant to the Inquiry, the 3rd Respondent, by the

letter dated 17.09.2018 marked as P9 requested the Petitioner to produce the income

statement of her husband who is a driver in the Colombo Municipal Council.

Consequently, the Petitioner produced her husbands income statement (marked as

P10(c)) at the time of the issuance of the Permit marked as P1. After the inquiry was

concluded the Petitioner was informed by the 3rd Respondent that, steps would be taken

to cancel the Permit marked as P1 as it has been obtained by submitting false

information.

Thereafter, the Petitioner received a copy of a letter dated 14.02.2019 marked as P11

written by the Land Commissioner General addressed to the 3rd Respondent where it

has been stated that when considering the facts that the Petitioners husband is a public

servant and her mother is Widows and Orphans Pensioner it is proper to cancel the

Permit marked as P1 and to reselect a person who will be entitled to a permit for the

subject matter according to the current income status. By the letter dated 11.03.2019

marked as P12, the Petitioner was informed by the 3rd Respondent to hand over the

Permit marked as P1, since the 3rd Respondent has been instructed by the Land

Commissioner General to cancel the Permit. Thereafter, the 3rd Respondent, by the

letter dated 27.05.2019 marked as P20, informed the Petitioner that she had obtained

4

the Permit marked as P1 furnishing false information at the land Kachcheri and an

inquiry will be held facilitating the Petitioner to show cause as to why the Permit should

not be cancelled. The 3rd Respondent issued a letter dated 19.07.2019 marked as P22

requiring the Petitioner to participate in an inquiry, but the Petitioner did not cooperate

to hold the inquiry.

By the letter dated 04.10.2019 marked as P26 the 3rd Respondent informed the

Petitioner that at the time of issuance of the Permit, the Petitioner had suppressed the

fact that her husband is a public servant and obtained the Permit under the low-income

category, which the Petitioner does not belong and therefore it has been decided to

cancel the Permit and give it on a long-term lease to the Petitioner and her mother (1st

Respondent) in terms of the provisions of the Ordinance. By P11 the Land

Commissioner General has recommended to the 3rd Respondent to cancel P1 for the

reasons that the husband of the Petitioner is a public servant and the mother of the

Petitioner is a recipient of a Widows and Orphans Pension.

The Petitioner argues that the letters marked as P11 and P12 have been issued without

any power or authority in law to do so and she was not married at the time she applied

for the Permit and therefore she was not in a position at that time to furnish any

information regarding the person to whom she is going to get married. The position of

the Petitioner is that in terms of Section 106 of the Ordinance, a Government Agent

could only issue notice of cancellation of an existing permit if he/she has failed to

5

observe conditions of the said permit already granted but in the instant matter the

Petitioner has not violated any of the conditions of the Permit marked as P1.

Therefore, the Petitioner seeks the following substantive reliefs, inter alia,

(b) The letter dated 14/02/2019 sent by the 5th Respondent marked as P-11 be quashed

by an Order in the nature of Writ of Certiorari.

(c) The letter dated 11/03/2019 sent by the 3rd Respondent marked as "P - 12" be

quashed by an Order in the nature of Writ of Certiorari.

(d) Restraining the 3rd Respondent from holding any inquiry on the basis of the

aforesaid letters marked as "P-11" and/or "P-12".

The position of the learned DSG appearing for the 3rd to 5th Respondents is that the 2nd

Respondent requested the 3rd Respondent to issue a separate permit to a portion of the

subject land by the letter dated 23.04.2018 marked as R2 and by the letter marked as

P4, the Petitioner made a complaint to the 3rd Respondent that the 2nd Respondent has

violated her rights as a permit holder by executing a notarial lease. Thereafter, an office

inquiry was held on 21.05.2018 (R4). However, as no settlement was entered between

the parties, the 3rd Respondent by the letter dated 09.06.2018 marked as R5 reported

this matter to the Provincial Land Commissioner (Western Province). By the letter

dated 23.07.2018 marked as R6, the Provincial Land Commissioner (Western Province)

informed the 3rd Respondent to hold an inquiry into that matter. Thereafter, the 3rd

Respondent issued the letter marked P7 calling the Petitioner, the 1st and the 2nd

6

Respondents for an inquiry to be held on 27.08.2018. At the inquiry, it transpired that

the Permit marked as P1 had been issued to the Petitioner as an individual falling into

the low-income category despite the Petitioners husband being a salaried public

servant. Then the letter marked as P9 was issued requesting the Petitioner to provide

salary details of her husband as of the date the Permit marked as P1 was issued. The

learned DSG appearing for the 3rd to 5th Respondents argues that the Petitioner had

married on 17.02.1994 (R8) and according to the documents submitted by the Petitioner

marked as P10(a) and P10(c), the Petitioners husband received a basic monthly salary

of Rs. 4430/- as at 08.08.1998, the date on which the Permit marked as P1 was issued

and this is contrary to the position taken up by the Petitioner, as in fact she was married

at the time P1 was issued. Moreover, it transpired from the documents produced by the

1st Respondent marked as R9(a) and R9(b) that the Petitioners father was holding a

pensionable post in a local authority. These facts were reported to the 5th Respondent

by the 3rd Respondent in the letter dated 09.10.2018 marked as R10(a) and by the letter

dated 06.12.2018 marked as R10(b) the 3rd Respondent sought advice from the 5th

Respondent in respect of further steps to be taken on that matter. Then by the letter

marked as P11 the 5th Respondent informed that it was appropriate to cancel the Permit

and informed the Petitioner by the letter marked as P12 to hand over the Permit to

facilitate the cancellation.

The position of the learned DSG appearing for the 3rd to 5th Respondents is that the

Permit marked as P1 has been issued to the Petitioner on the premise that she fell into

7

the low-income earning category in terms of the Order 3(c)(ii) of the Land

Development Ordinance Regulations (1981) (P18(a)) and Land Manual Order 102.

Therefore, the Petitioner was not required to pay the purchase amount under Section

19(2) of the Ordinance and in terms of Section 19(5) of the Ordinance she was

exempted from paying the said purchase amount on the basis that the Petitioner

belongs to the peasant class (the low-income earning category) and this is evident on

the face of the Permit marked as P1 as it does not contain an endorsement by the 3rd

Respondent about the date on which the payment of annual instalments under the Permit

must commence and the amount of each such instalment. In terms of the Petitioners

marriage certificate marked as R8, the Petitioner in fact had been married for over four

years before the Permit marked as P1 was issued and she ought to have supplied such

information to the 3rd Respondent when applying for the permit. Therefore, the learned

DSG appearing for the 3rd to 5th Respondents argues that this instant Application should

be dismissed in limine as the Petitioner is guilty of suppression and misrepresentation

of material facts.

It is trite law that the Court will not intervene by way of judicial review where there is

suppression and/or misrepresentation of material facts in exercising the Writ

jurisdiction of this Court. In the case of Alphonso Appuhamy Vs. Hettiarachchi1

Pathirana J. had observed that;

1 77 NLR 131.

8

The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed

before the court when an application for a writ or injunction is made and the

process of the court is invoked is laid down in the case of The King v. The General

Commissioners for the purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the District of

Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmond de Poignac - (1917) Kings Bench Division

486. Although this case deals with a writ of Prohibition the principles enunciated

are applicable to all cases of writs or 13 injunctions. In this case a Divisional

Court without dealing with the merits of the case discharged the rule on the

ground that the applicant had suppressed or misrepresented the facts material to

her application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court

that there had been a suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit

and therefore it was justified in refusing a writ of Prohibition without going into

the merits of the case. In other words, so rigorous is the necessity for a full and

truthful disclosure of all material facts that the court would not go into the merits

of the application, but will dismiss it without further examination.

In the case of Sarath Hulangamuwa Vs. Siriwardena, Principal, Vishaka Vidyalaya and

others2. Siva Selliah, J. held that,

2 (1986) 1 SLR 275 at 282.

9

Petitioner who seeks relief by writ which is an extraordinary remedy must in

fairness to this court, bare every material fact so that the discretion of this court

is not wrongly invoked or exercised.

Saleem Marsoof, J. in Namunukula Plantations Ltd. Vs. Minister of Lands and Others3

held that,

If any party invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of a court of law is found

wanting in the discharge of its duty to disclose all material facts or is shown to

have attempted to pollute the pure stream of justice, the court not only has the

right but a duty to deny relief to such person.

Vide; Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd v Wilfred Van Else & Others,4 Jayasinghe Vs. The

National Institute of Fisheries and Nautical Engineering and Others,5 Dahanayake

and Others Vs. Sri Lankan Insurance Corporation Ltd. and Others6, Fonseka Vs. Lt.

General Jagath Jayasuriya and Five Others7.

The Petitioner in this instant Application has admitted in averment 7 of the Petition the

fact that she got married in the year 1994, four years prior to the issuance of the Permit

marked as P1 in the year 1998. However, it is observed that the Petitioner has not

produced her marriage certificate before this Court. The fact that whether the Petitioner

6 (2005) 1 SLR 67.

7 (2011) 2 Sri LR 372.

10

was married at the time of applying for the Permit marked as P1 is a material fact which

has an important bearing on the question of the genuineness of the Petitioner in

obtaining the Permit marked as P1. Even though the Petitioner argues that she was not

married at the time she furnished the relevant information in applying for the Permit,

the Petitioner neither disclosed the time in which she made the application to obtain the

Permit nor has produced any material before this Court to prove the fact that she married

after applying for the Permit. Therefore, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is

guilty of suppression or misrepresentation of material facts. Furthermore, this Court

could observe a lack of uberrima fides on the part of the Petitioner as the Petitioner was

married at the time of issuance of the Permit marked as P1 and she has not come before

this Court with clean hands.

In the case of Namunukula Plantations Ltd. Vs. Minister of Lands and Others (supra)

Saleem Marsoof, J. further held that,

It is settled law that a person who approaches the Court for grant of

discretionary relief, to which category an application for certiorari would

undoubtedly belong, has to come with clean hands, and should candidly disclose

all the material facts which have any bearing on, the adjudication of the issues

raised in the case. In other words, he owes a duty of utmost good faith (uberrima

fides) to the court to make a full and complete disclosure of all material facts and

refrain from concealing or suppressing any material fact within his knowledge or

11

which he could have known by exercising diligence expected of a person of

ordinary prudence.

In Fonseka Vs. Lt. General Jagath Jayasuriya8 Abdus Salam, J. observed that,

A maxim known almost during the whole of last century and having its origin in

equity courts is that one must approach the court with clean hands. The maxim

has been so indoctrinated in the legal system that almost all our courts, loath to

entertain claims that are tainted with non-disclosure of material facts. It is

particularly so when the benefit of the maxim is invoked by the respondent or

raised by court exmero motu.

It is evident from the letter marked as P26 that the Petitioner has suppressed the fact

that her husband was a salaried public servant at the time of issuance of the Permit and

had obtained the Permit marked as P1 under the low-income category. P26 states

thus,

, .

.

8 (2011) 2 Sri LR 372.

12

Under the above-stated circumstances, it is apparent that the Petitioner has not come

before this Court with clean hands and suppressed material facts.

Therefore, the Petitioner is not entitled to the reliefs sought in prayer (b) to (d) of the

Petition. Hence, I dismiss the Writ Application. No costs ordered.

Application dismissed.
