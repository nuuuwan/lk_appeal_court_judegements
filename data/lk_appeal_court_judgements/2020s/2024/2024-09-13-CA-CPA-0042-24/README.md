Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an application in revision preferred by the respondent-petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction granted to this Court in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution.

He is the respondent named in the High Court of Gampaha Case Number

SPL/1/2024. The petitioner is seeking to set aside or revise the order dated 25-

04-2024 made by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha in the above-

mentioned case.

When this matter was supported for notice and a stay order, after having

considered the relevant facts, circumstances and the law, this Court decided to

grant notice to the petitioner-respondents named in the application and also

issue interim orders required for the effective consideration of the application

before the Court.

At the hearing of this application, we heard the submissions of the learned

Counsel for the petitioner and the submissions of the learned Senior Deputy

Solicitor General (SDSG) who opposed the application and argued that the order

made by the learned High Court Judge should remain, as it was an order made

after considering the relevant provisions of the law.

This is a matter where the Senior Superintendent of Police of Gampaha Division

I has made an application under High Court of Gampaha Case Number

Page 4 of 20

SPL/1/2024, apparently on the basis of section 7 of the Prevention of Money

Laundering Act No. 5 of 2006 as amended by the Amendment Act No. 40 of 2011

(hereinafter referred to as the Act).

In his application, which has been supported by the prosecuting State Counsel

of Gampaha High Court, the said applicant has informed the Court that he

conducted an investigation against the petitioner in terms of the Act, and as a

result, he issued a freezing order relating to two passenger transport buses,

numbered NG-4666 and NG-3666, and had moved to extend the freezing order

for a further period of 3 months enabling him to proceed with his investigations

under the Act. He has also submitted the relevant freezing order issued by him

dated 05-01-2024 to the petitioner in that regard, marking the said freezing order

as P-02.

In the same application, he has produced another freezing order, which has been

marked as P-03, relating to a motorbike numbered WP-BII-8938 belonging to the

wife of the petitioner and has moved to extend the freezing order in relation to

that as well, on the same basis.

When this application was made and supported on 11-01-2024, the learned High

Court Judge, after having considered the application made ex parte, has

pronounced the following order.

. .2, .3

.

.

.

Thereafter, on 29-01-2024, the petitioner, through his Counsel has made an

application to the High Court informing the Court that the police took into their

custody, not only the mentioned buses and the motorcycle, but also several other

items from his house including some other vehicles, some title deeds and

household items, and had reported to the learned Magistrate of Gampaha of that

Page 5 of 20

fact under the Magistrates Court of Gampaha Case Number B4371-23, contrary

to the provisions of the Act.

However, making submissions before the High Court, the learned Counsel for

the petitioner has made an application in terms of section 10 of the Act to allow

the petitioner to use the two buses mentioned in the alleged freezing order so

that it can be used for carrying out legitimate business. It has been submitted

that he has been using these buses for passenger transport in terms of the

relevant permits issued by the relevant authorities, and also to transport workers

of a garment factory where he earns legitimate income. It has also been pointed

out that the petitioner has been in possession of these buses since 2013 and had

obtained them under financial facilities obtained through a leasing company.

The learned Counsel has justified reasons for his application by making

submissions in that regard.

At that point, the prosecuting State Counsel has objected to the application on

the basis that the petitioner has no locus standi to make such an application in

terms of section 10 of the Act.

Apparently, this has resulted in the learned High Court Judge making a Directive

for the applicant of the application filed before the High Court, namely the Senior

Superintendent of Police, to be personally present in Court. The proceedings of

the days that followed the said order shows that lengthy submissions have been

made by the prosecuting State Counsel opposing this application by the

petitioner. It has also been proposed to appoint a receiver () to make

use and maintain the two buses.

The petitioner has also made submissions in that regard, and the learned High

Court Judge has finally made the impugned order on 25-04-2024. In his order,

the learned High Court Judge has considered the provisions of section 10 and

11 of the Act as the relevant provisions in relation to the application, and has

considered the reasons urged by the petitioner for the release of the buses to his

possession.

Page 6 of 20

In this process, the learned High Court Judge has reached determinations,

which I believe should be reproduced in verbatim for better understanding of the

order. (At pages 66 and 67 of the case brief)

When this matter was argued before this Court, it was the contention of the

learned Counsel for the petitioner that the actions taken by the police and the

procedure followed, apparently in terms of the Act were illegal and nothing

known to the law. It was his position that the police cannot take the law into

Page 7 of 20

their own hands under the provisions of the Act in the guise of a freezing order

and to act in the manner they have acted.

It was also submitted that the police have misled the High Court to show that

the freezing order that the police wanted the Court to approve was issued in

accordance with the law and has failed to inform the Court that the police took

custody of the two vehicles, among other things contrary to the provisions of the

Act.

It was his view that anything that flows from misrepresentation of facts and the

law to the Court can have no legal validity.

However, it was submitted by the learned Counsel that if the police wants to

conduct an investigation in terms of the Act, they can do so, and also they can

keep the other properties taken into their custody for the purposes of the

purported investigations. It was his position that despite the illegality of the

actions of the police, the petitioner made this application before the High Court

of Gampaha in terms of section 10 of the Act, as he is entitled, only in relation

to the two buses mentioned in the purported freezing order marked P-02.

He also pointed out the justifications he had in relation to the application when

the application was made to the High Court. It was the position of the learned

Counsel for the petitioner that the learned High Court Judge was wrong in

deciding to appoint a receiver () in this regard, as appointing a

receiver would not arise in a situation like this, where the petitioner is the

registered owner of the two buses mentioned from whose custody the police have

already taken the buses. Under the circumstances, he prayed for the reliefs as

prayed for in his petition.

Making submissions opposing the application of the petitioner, it was the

position of the learned SDSG that, out of the 7 reliefs sought by the petitioner in

his petition filed before this Court, the 1st three reliefs, namely the issuing of

notice to the respondents, and the two interim orders sought by him, have

already been granted by the Court.

Page 8 of 20

Referring to the other 4 reliefs that has been sought by the petitioner, namely,

setting aside of the impugned order dated 25-04-2024, allowing of the

petitioners application made to the High Court in terms of section 10 of the Act,

seeking a Directive to the learned High Court Judge to order the release of the 2

buses, and any other reliefs the Court may think fit, it was the submission of the

learned SDSG that since the petitioner has failed to challenge the original

freezing order made by the Senior Superintendent of Police, or the extension of

it by the learned High Court Judge, this Court has no basis to grant any of the

reliefs sought by the petitioner.

He was also of the view that this Court cannot grant reliefs, which had not been

asked for or prayed for by the petitioner.

On the above basis, the learned SDSG submitted that he is not going to make

submissions in reply to the allegations made in relation to the procedures

adopted by the police, as they are not relevant to the matter.

However, it was the submission of the learned SDSG that the orders made by

the learned High Court Judge in relation to the extension of the freezing order,

and appointing a receiver, were within the relevant provisions of the law that

should not be interfered by this Court.

In this process, the learned SDSG also admitted the seizure of the property by

the police, which was an act done before the issuing of the purported freezing

orders marked P-02 and P-03.

The learned SDSG moved for the dismissal of the revision application on the

basis that no exceptional circumstances had arisen for the petitioner to challenge

the order made by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha.

It is well-settled law that the remedy of revision, being an extraordinary

discretionary remedy, can only be granted under exceptional circumstances.

Page 9 of 20

Under paragraph 24 of the petition, the petitioner has listed several grounds,

which he has termed as exceptional grounds that exist for him to file this

application before the Court.

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Tharmaratnam (Sri Skantha Law Report Vol-IV

47), it was observed;

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the consciences of the

Court.

It was held in the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Mercantile Hotels

Management Ltd. 1987 1 SLR 5 that;

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

The matter under consideration revolves around an application made to the High

Court and actions done purportedly in terms of the Prevention of Money

Laundering Act.

It needs to be emphasized the ever-increasing necessity to clamp down money

laundering activities happening in our society and the crimes of similar nature.

However, it is the view of this Court that the law enforcement authorities should

be aware that conducting investigations and bringing the culprits before the

Court should be done by acting within the relevant parameters of the law as

permitted in the relevant statutes available in that regard. No one should be

permitted to act beyond the law, using methods that are not in accordance with

the law, and to justify such activities subsequently through the process of the

Court. The Court shall not allow any attempt to obtain the sanction of the Court

by misrepresenting facts, to justify illegal procedures followed.

It is also the view of this Court that the law enforcement authorities as well as

the law officers of the State have a responsibility to act and assist the Court

Page 10 of 20

whenever such irregular procedures and other illegal actions are brought to the

notice of the Court with the view of correcting the same, so that such

unwarranted actions can be prevented in future.

In that context, I am in no position to agree with the submissions of the learned

SDSG, which was done on a highly technical basis, rather than going into the

core issue of the application before the Court as to the applicability of the

provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

As I have previously stated in this judgment, the Senior Superintendent of Police

of Gampaha Division has made the initial application before the High Court of

Gampaha on the basis that he issued a freezing order in terms of section 7 of the

Act, and now he is in need of getting the said freezing order extended and follow

the necessary other legal requirements in that regard. It is on that basis, the

learned High Court Judge of Gampaha has considered this application and had

made his order dated 11-01-2024.

However, the documents submitted to this Court, as well as to the High Court

when the petitioner made an application in terms of section 10 of the Act shows

that the submissions made before the High Court when the initial application by

the Senior Superintendent of Police was made, was not only incorrect, but in

fact, misleading.

The document marked X-1 (at page 86 of the brief), which is a true copy of the

B-reports filed before the Magistrates Court of Gampaha in Case Number

B4371/23 reveals that the Officer-in-Charge (OIC) of Bemmulla police station

has filed an initial B-report on 21-12-2023 before the learned Magistrate of

Gampaha, informing that he is conducting an investigation against the petitioner

in terms of the Act. He has sought several orders from the learned Magistrate for

the purposes of his investigation.

On 28-12-2023, the OIC of Gampaha Divisional Crime Investigation Unit has

filed a further report before the Magistrates Court informing the learned

Magistrate that, as a result of the investigations conducted in terms of the Act,

Page 11 of 20

28 items of property were seized by the police from the premises of the petitioner

and taken into police custody. The said items had been entered in the production

record book of the police station. This includes the two buses and the motor bike

mentioned in the application filed before the High Court by the Senior

Superintendent of Police. The OIC has informed that these items are properties

allegedly obtained by money laundering, and therefore, constitutes an offence

punishable in terms of section 3 of the Act.

This clearly shows that the police have taken into custody the relevant two buses

and several other properties from the house of the petitioner well before the

purported freezing order submitted to the High Court of Gampaha by the Senior

Superintendent of Police was issued. The said freezing order has been issued on

05-01-2024 after the goods were seized by the police on a date prior to 28-12-

2023, whereas, the police had no right to do so under the provisions of the Act.

What they should have done was to issue a Freezing Order as per the provisions

of the Act, and not to seize the property as they have done.

The relevant section 7 under which the Senior Superintendent of Police has

issued this purported belated freezing order reads as follows.

07. A Police Officer not below the rank of an Assistant Superintendent

of Police of police may, where there are reasonable grounds to believe

that any such person is involved in any activity relating to the offence

of money laundering and it is necessary for preventing further acts

being committed in relation to such offence, issue an order

(hereinafter referred to as a Freezing Order) prohibiting any

transaction relating to any account, property or investment which

may have been used or which may be intended to be used in

connection with such offence.

The provisions of section 7 clearly shows that it is a freezing order that should

be issued, to the person who is believed to be involved in such activity referred

Page 12 of 20

to in section 7(1) of the Act or any other person or institution who or which may

be required to give effect to such an order.

Section 7(3) stipulates that such an order shall be in force for a period of 7 days.

It is the duty of the police officer who issues the freezing order to act in terms of

section 8 of the Act within the effective period of his initial freezing order.

The relevant section 8(1) of the Act reads as follows.

8(1). The Police Officer issuing the Freezing Order under the

provisions of section 7 shall, within the seven days during which such

Order shall be in force, make an ex parte application to the High Court

seeking confirmation of such Freezing Order and also if the

circumstances so necessitate, request an extension of the original

period of seven days.

The section also stipulates that the learned High Court Judge before whom the

relevant application is made, if satisfied that there are sufficient reasons for

making such a freezing order, can confirm the freezing order, and also grant the

extension of the freezing order which shall not exceed 3 months at a time, and

in any event, the aggregate extension shall not exceed a period of 2 years from

the date of issuing of the freezing order by such police officer.

The proviso to section 8 also provides that if an indictment is filed for an offence

under section 3 of the Act in relation to the subject of the freezing order, such a

freezing order shall remain in force until the conclusion of the trial in respect of

such an offence or in case of an appeal, until the determination of the appeal.

It needs to be emphasized that the relevant provisions of the Act do not give any

power to the police to seize property from a persons possession. In other words,

to take away property from the person under investigation and take them under

police custody or to produce such property before the Magistrates Court or the

High Court for that matter.

Page 13 of 20

The power vested in the police is to freeze the property under the possession of

the person who has the custody of such property in terms of section 7 of the Act,

which amounts to prohibiting any transaction in relation to the property, while

allowing the custody of the property with the person who had it, and to continue

with the investigations under the Act. Thereafter, the police should seek for

relevant Directives from the relevant High Court as stipulated in the Act.

I find nothing wrong in the police reporting facts to the Magistrates Court to

inform that an investigation is being conducted and applying for necessary

orders to facilitate effective investigations as provided in the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, other than matters relating to a freezing order, where the relevant

High Court has been conferred with jurisdiction in that regard.

However, police have no power in the guise of conducting investigations, to seize

property and take any property under their custody. In my view, this is what had

exactly happened in this matter, which was an act done contrary to the

provisions of the Act, which amounts to an illegal act.

Besides the illegality of the seizure of property, it appears that since the Senior

Superintendent of Police has made an application before the High Court of

Gampaha and has obtained the extension of the alleged order, the petitioner has

made an application as he is legally entitled to make, in terms of section 10 of

the Act.

The relevant section 10 of the Act as amended by the Amendment Act No. 40 of

2011 reads as follows.

10. In confirming a Freezing Order made under section 7, the High

Court may on an application made in that behalf, if it is of opinion

that such an Order could damage legitimate business or other

interests of any person affected thereby, and that essential

transactions relating to such account, property or investment as may

have been prohibited by such Freezing Order may be legitimately

carried out, make order sanctioning the carrying on of such

Page 14 of 20

transactions subject to supervision by and under the direction of a

person appointed in that behalf by Court or of a receiver appointed in

that behalf under section 11.

Although the prosecuting State Counsel before the High Court of Gampaha has

objected the learned Counsel for the petitioner making an application in terms

of section 10 of the Act, I find that he was misguided as to the relevant provisions

of section 10 when he raised an objection in that manner.

Section 10 of the Act permits the petitioner, being the registered owner of the

two vehicles, or any other person mentioned under the provisions of section 10,

to make an application for him to carry out transactions relating to the subject

matter of the freezing order that can be legitimately carried out under

supervision and the direction of a person appointed on that behalf by the Court

or of a receiver () appointed on that behalf under section 11.

It appears that when this application was made before the High Court, the

learned High Court Judge has been misdirected in interpreting the provisions of

section 10 of the Act in relation to section 11, where provisions have been made

for the appointment of a receiver ().

The relevant section 11 of the Act reads as follows.

11. Upon an application made in that behalf by a police officer not

below the rank of an Assistant Superintendent of Police, the High

Court may appoint a Receiver to take possession of and otherwise

deal with the account, property or investment which has been

subjected to the Freezing Order, in accordance with such directions

as may be given by Court in that behalf.

The provisions of section 11 are clear that the purpose of appointing a receiver

is to take possession of or and otherwise deal with the accounts, property or

investments which has been subjected to a freezing order.

Page 15 of 20

The application made to the Court by the petitioner had been to seek sanction

to carry out legitimate transactions relating to the two buses he had obtained on

lease through a leasing company. The application has been on the basis that if

he is prevented from using the buses for the purposes of transporting

passengers, for which he has already obtained necessary permits from the

relevant authorities and for the use of the same for transporting garment factory

workers as he has been doing until the buses were seized, would prevent him

from paying the leasing rentals, and the two buses will become useless to anyone

if kept parked without being used over a prolonged period of time.

It appears from the proceedings before the High Court that when this application

was made, a counter-proposal has been made by the police to appoint a receiver

in terms of section 11 of the Act. It has been proposed that, the Manager of the

Gampaha Depot of Ceylon Transport Board should be appointed as the receiver

and he should be allowed to make use of the buses under the conditions

proposed by the applicant. It appears that this has been the basis for the learned

High Court Judge to order that the buses seized by the police should be handed

over to the said Depot Manager under the conditions stipulated.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the petitioner that if such an

order is carried out, the buses belonging to the petitioner would be handed over

to an institution which bears no responsibility for proper maintenance and

payment of the leasing rentals to the leasing company, which would result in the

destruction of the buses and nothing else.

It is my considered view that although the learned High Court Judge has

apparently acted in terms of section 11 of the Act, this is a situation where

appointing of a receiver had not arisen. In my view, section 11 should become

applicable, especially, in situations where there is no one to claim ownership or

possession of a property which is a subject matter of an inquiry in terms of the

Act. However, in the instant matter, there is no dispute that the petitioner is the

registered owner of the two buses as well as the person who had possession of

Page 16 of 20

the buses, as well as other properties taken over by the police contrary to the

provisions of the Act.

I am strongly of the view that no Court should allow the police or anyone else to

abuse the process of the Court and obtain orders to cover up things done without

following the due process.

I am of the view that the police had acted illegally when they took charge of the

things mentioned in the B-report filed before the Magistrates Court. It has

misled the High Court by pretending that it was under a freezing order issued by

the Senior Superintendent of Police in relation to the two buses and the

motorbike referred to in the application filed before the High Court that they

come before the Court. No mention had been made of the fact that the vehicles

are already under police custody after the police seized them.

I am of the view that this is a matter, which shocks the conscience of the Court,

and a matter, which needs to be corrected by invoking the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Court.

Although the police may have knowingly or unknowingly, misinterpreted the

word Freezing Order mentioned in section 7 of the Act, and also has

misrepresented facts to the learned High Court Judge as I have considered

before, it appears from the documents submitted to this Court by the parties

that the Senior Superintendent of Police who made this application before the

High Court has reported facts to the Hon. Attorney General with the relevant

documents and had sought the Hon. Attorney Generals intervention in order to

obtain the relevant orders from the High Court.

There would have been no difficulty for the relevant officers of the Hon. Attorney

General to understand that the police have followed illegal procedures from the

very outset of this matter. Rather than issuing a freezing order, it is apparent

from the documents submitted to the Hon. Attorney General that the police have

illegally seized the goods mentioned under the pretext of acting under the Act.

Page 17 of 20

The documents tendered clearly shows that the purported freezing order has

been issued subsequent to the seizure of the property, which should not be the

case.

It is my considered view, if the facts reported to the Hon. Attorney General were

considered in its correct perspective, rather than attempting to justify illegal

actions of the police, this action would have not come this far. I firmly believe

that it was the duty of the Hon. Attorney General to bring these matters to the

attention of the learned High Court Judge and also to give directions to the police

in order to rectify the actions taken by them, and to proceed with the relevant

inquiry in accordance with the law.

Another matter that needs serious attention of the Court is the procedure that

appears to have been adopted by the police after the seizure of the property

mentioned in the B-report filed before the Magistrates Court of Gampaha.

As I have stated before, there is no provision in the Act to seize property from

anybodys custody other than issuing a freezing order in terms of section 7 of the

Act and to proceed therefrom. If the police seize any property on the basis that

the said property relates or is suspected to be used in the commission of any

offence, the police should have acted in terms of section 431 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

The relevant section 431(1) reads as follows.

431. (1) The seizure by any police officer of property taken under

section 29 or alleged or suspected to have been stolen or found under

circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of any

offence shall be immediately reported to a Magistrate who shall

forthwith make such order as he thinks fit respecting of the delivery

of such property to the person entitled to the possession thereof or if

such person cannot be ascertained respecting the custody and

production of such property.

Page 18 of 20

This is not a situation where the police have recovered any dangerous drug in

terms of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance where they

themselves can send the dangerous drug found to the Government Analyst to

obtain a report, but other properties taken from the household of the petitioner.

Although I find that the fact of taking into custody 28 items of property including

the two buses relating to this application has been reported to the Magistrates

Court on 28-12-2023, I am unable to find anything in the B-report to the effect

that the police have produced the said property before the learned Magistrate of

Gampaha. It is not clear whether the said properties had been subsequently

produced before the learned Magistrate or is still under the police custody, which

is also in my view against the law.

I find no basis to the argument by the learned SDSG that this Court can only

give reliefs in relation to what have been asked for and nothing else.

It needs to be noted that this is an application invoking the discretionary remedy

of revision, which is a special jurisdiction exclusively vested with this Court. I

am of the view that it is the duty of this Court to intervene in a matter of this

nature and correct the misdeeds that had occurred to ensure that the ends of

justice have been met.

In the case of Attorney General Vs. Gunawardene (1996) 2 SLR 149, it was

held;

In terms of section 11, 13 and 54 of the Administration of Justice Law the

Supreme Court appears to have the widest powers of revision in respect of

proceedings of a High Court. By its nature revision involves the supervision

by a Superior Court of the proceedings of subordinate Court to ensure that

due and orderly administration of justice, and prima facie its exercise is

peculiarly called for in cases in which no remedy such as an appeal is

available.

Page 19 of 20

Revision like an appeal is directed towards the correction of errors, but it is

supervisory in nature, and its object is the due administration of justice and

not primarily or solely the relieving of grievances of a party.

In exercising powers of revision, the appellate Court is not trimmed by

technical rules of pleadings and procedure. In doing so, this Court has power

to act whether it is set in motion by a party or not, and even ex mero motu.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that not only the order

dated 25-04-2024 of the learned High Court Judge cannot be allowed to stand,

it is the duty of the Court to see to it the restoration of the status quo of the two

buses, which is the subject matter of this application in relation to the day where

the two vehicles were illegally taken into custody under the pretext of the

provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

Accordingly, I set aside the impugned order dated 25-04-2024 by the learned

High Court Judge of Gampaha in High Court of Gampaha Case Number

SPL/1/2024.

I order that the two buses taken into custody of the police, namely the vehicles

bearing number WP-NG-4666 and WP-NG-3666, shall be released to the

petitioner forthwith by the Senior Superintendent of Police-I of Gampaha

District, who is the person who made the application to the High Court claiming

that he issued a freezing order in relation to the two vehicles.

It is also directed that if the relevant Officer has gone on transfer, this order shall

be carried out by the successor of that Office.

As I find that the said two buses and all other things taken into custody by the

police have been entered in the police production record book and the learned

Magistrate of Gampaha has been informed of the said taking over of the

properties, if the said two buses had been handed over to the Magistrate Court

of Gampaha by the applicant of this case or by any one of his authorized officers,

Page 20 of 20

this order shall be construed as an order made to the learned Magistrate of

Gampaha that the said two vehicles shall be forthwith released to the petitioner.

However, this order shall not prevent the applicant in High Court of Gampaha

Case Number SPL/1/2024 or any other officer who is authorized to conduct an

investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and to issue a

freezing order acting in terms of section 7 of the Act and doing things in a legal

manner, if such officer finds reasons to issue relevant freezing orders against the

petitioner or others in relation to an inquiry under the provisions of the Act.

The learned High Court Judge of Gampaha is directed to give necessary orders

in compliance of this judgment, if necessary.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High

Court of Gampaha and to the Magistrates Court of Gampaha for necessary

action.
