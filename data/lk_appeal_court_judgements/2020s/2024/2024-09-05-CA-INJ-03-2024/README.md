M.C.B.S. Morais J.

The Petitioner, Spectrum Pharmatech Lanka (Private) Ltd, is a company duly incorporated

under the laws of Sri Lanka and operates as a subsidiary of Spectrum Pharmatech Consultants

(Private) Limited, a corporation based in Mumbai, India. The 1st Respondent is the State

Minister of Production, Supply, and Regulation of Pharmaceuticals, who operates under the

direct authority of the Ministry of Health of Sri Lanka and the 2nd Respondent is the Minister

of Health of Sri Lanka.

The establishment of a pharmaceutical production zone at Oyamaduwa, Anuradhapura, has

been approved by the cabinet of Sri Lanka. The 2nd Respondent released an Expression of

Interest in January 2021, inviting local and foreign developers with experience in

pharmaceutical industry to develop and set up a project to establish Sri Lanka's first

Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Zone in Oyamaduwa, Anuradhapura. Following their

expression of interest and participation in the bidding procedure, the Petitioner was awarded

the bid designating them as the "Zone Developer" for the planned Zone in or around March

2021, with no objections raised. The Petitioner and the 1st Respondent signed a Development

and Management Agreement on 30th of August 2021, according to the document submitted as

"P4".

Page 3 of 5

The Zone Developer was obligated by the conditions of the agreement to finish this project

on schedule. Nevertheless, upon failing to complete it in the allotted time, the parties had

subsequently agreed to a different deadline for the project's completion.

The Petitioner states that,

According to the 10th paragraph of the petition filed on 15th of March 2024, Respondents

informed the Petitioner that,

a. The Zone was to be developed by the Petitioner;

b. Notwithstanding, private parties were to invest monies with Respondent to lease out

land parcels and also with the petitioner for the development and maintenance of the

Zone;

c. Such parties were, in return, to be allotted land parcels on a leased basis and were to

be permitted to set up pharmaceutical production facilities.

d. Once completed, this ambitious project of the Sri Lankan government is expected to

create over 2,000 direct and over 5,000 indirect jobs while the overall Zone would

attract direct investments totaling over 40 billion rupees.

However, to invest in the zone to be fully occupied, 24 potential investors should be selected.

Even though the Respondents said that 24 investors were supposed to invest in the zone, only

20 of them had finally given their consent. Just 12 investorsout of the aforementioned 20

investorssigned the management agreements with the Petitioner and only 7 members have

paid the first installment towards the one-time ZDP as of the date the Counter Objections

were filed. The subject contract includes all signed agreements between the Petitioner and the

tenants. A portion of the funds needed for the zone's development, which the Petitioner was

responsible for overseeing, were to come from the rent that investor tenants were expected to

pay. The Petitioner claims that buyback agreements were also made between the Respondents

and the renters.

However, there was an extraordinary and sharp increase in construction expenses at the start

of 2022 as a result of Sri Lanka's severe economic crisis. A portion of the tenants had failed

to pay the Petitioner, the Zone Development Premiums. The Petitioner received a notice from

the 2nd Respondent in May 2023 about the delayed pace of the Zone Development work.

However, as for the Petitioner, the Petitioner also experienced several delays on part of the

Respondents. Despite the Petitioner having several conversations with both the renters and

the 2nd Respondent, none of them worked out. Due to disagreements between the Petitioner

and the Respondents in these circumstances, the Petitioner requested arbitration in relation to

the disputes arose and served the Respondents with a Notice of Arbitration. More than 60

days have passed since the Arbitration Notice was sent, as of 09th of March 2024,

Respondents have not responded to it.

Contrary to the above position the Respondents state that,

The Ministry was keen to guarantee the prompt completion of the infrastructure development

and the start of operations of this project, according to the Respondents, and some investors

who had contributed funds to the project were legitimately displeased with the lack of

progress. The Petitioners themselves submitted a timeline, which they are unable to adhere to.

As agreed upon, a number of investors have already made payments to the zone developer.

That being said, the zone developer has asked the ministry to approve a larger investment

amount, which it is now requesting.

The Respondents claim that zone developers will be unable to finish this project in a timely

and satisfactory manner. As such, it is highly doubtful that they are capable of finishing this

project. In their project proposal, the Petitioners pledged to invest 600 million in this

endeavor. There would have been no financial obstacles in the way of the Petitioners

finishing this project if they had this money in reality. It is evident at this point that they are

not in possession of this money.

However, by answering these objections Petitioner states that,

Respondents are making attempts to alter agreements between investors and Respondents in a

way that would allow investors to completely leave the Zone, as well as to conduct actions

that are irrevocable and irreparable in an effort to frustrate the subject Contract. In an

application submitted to the Commercial High Court, the Petitioner requests the court's

involvement in order to appoint an arbitrator to serve as the Respondent's representative on

the arbitral panel. On 26th of June 2024, during the hearing in the Commercial High Court,

Page 5 of 5

the Respondents informed the court that they intended to appoint an arbitrator. It cannot be

disputed that the Petitioner, in his capacity as the Zone Developer, made a commitment to

invest a considerable amount of money in the project for its entire duration.

This court recognizes that the dispute at hand arises from the Development and Management

Agreement dated 30th of August 2021, which includes a binding arbitration clause mandating

that any conflicts be resolved through arbitration. It is understood that arbitration will serve

as the ultimate mechanism for the resolution of this matter.

However, as alleged there is a reasonable suspicion that the Respondents are currently

engaging in attempts to modify the existing agreements with investors in a manner that would

permit these investors to exit the Zone entirely. In light of these actions which pose a

significant risk of causing irreparable harm and fundamentally altering the status quo, this

court finds it necessary to intervene to preserve the current conditions and prevent any further

irreparable damage until the arbitration process can be properly convened and conducted.

Therefore, we grant the injunction as prayed for in prayer b of the petition dated 15th of

March 2024. It shall remain in effect for a period of three months from the date of this

judgment, or until the commencement of arbitration proceedings, whichever occurs first. The

court emphasizes that this order is issued to preserve the status quo of the subject matter and

to ensure that the arbitration process can proceed without hindrance.
