The Petitioner is a public servant and was serving as an Assistant Superintendent of Prisons

under the Department of Prisons. By a letter dated 27.06.2020, marked P23, the Petitioner

was informed that he had been interdicted with immediate effect. Such interdiction has been

carried out subject to the approval of the Public Service Commission (PSC) and conducting

a formal disciplinary inquiry. The said letter P23 indicates that the Petitioner has been

interdicted as a consequence of the matters disclosed in the report issued following a

preliminary investigation against the Petitioner and also based on the alleged misconduct

revealed in the report of the Acting Inspector General of Police. The PSC by letter dated

10.07.2020 marked P24 has granted covering approval for such interdiction. In the

meantime, facts have been reported to the Magistrates Court of Negombo in case No.

M/24077, naming the Petitioner as a suspect. The Petitioner was served with a Charge Sheet

marked P26 in view of commencing formal disciplinary proceedings against him by the

Commissioner General of Prisons- 1st Respondent. Subsequently, the Petitioner was indicted

in the High Court of Negombo in case bearing No. 1063/2020 and the said indictment is

marked P25.

The Petitioner complains that the said Charge Sheet has been framed in ignorance of the

provisions of the Prisons Ordinance (Ordinance) and the General Rules Relating to Prisons

promulgated under the said Ordinance and as such the charges therein have no merit and are

illegal. Further, the Petitioner contends that placing him under interdiction for over two years

without salary is contrary to the provisions of the Establishments Code (E-Code) and is

illegal. Similarly, the Petitioner pleads that the continuous interdiction of the Petitioner

without reinstating him in service is unreasonable, irrational and tainted with malice.

Based on the alleged grounds mentioned above, the Petitioner seeks a writ of Mandamus

directing the 1st to 11th Respondents to reinstate the Petitioner in service and also to pay the

Petitioner a monthly salary from the date of interdiction i.e, 27.06.2020.

The Petitioner claims that he filed the instant Application on 22.07.2022 when he was kept

under interdiction and before the conclusion of the formal disciplinary inquiry. The PSC on

Page 4 of 11

14.03.2023, based on the report following the formal disciplinary inquiry conducted against

the Petitioner, decided: (Vide- the letter dated 05.07.2023 marked X1)

a. to reduce the Petitioners post to a lower post in terms of Clause 24:3:8 of Chapter

XLVIII of Volume II of the E-Code.

b. to Defer six salary increments.

It appears that the current Chairman and members of the PSC, based on the recommendations

of the Constitutional Council, were appointed during the month of April 2023. For reasons

unknown to Court the said newly constituted PSC has revisited the above decision taken on

14.03.2023. As a consequence, the PSC on 05.07.2023 took a further decision against the

Petitioner as follows; (Vide- the said document marked X1)

a. To continue to place the Petitioner on interdiction based on the reason that the

reinstatement of the Petitioner would be detrimental to the interests of the Public

Service and the case bearing No. HC 1063/2020,

b. A decision upon the payment of arrears of salary for the period where the Petitioner

was on interdiction will be taken only after the conclusion of the aforesaid High Court

case and also considering the final judgement of the said case.

The Petitioner strongly argues that after the PSC took a decision on 14.03.2023, upon the

formal disciplinary inquiry against the Petitioner, the members of the PSC which was

constituted subsequently will have no authority or power to make a further decision to

interdict the Petitioner causing a detriment to him. The main contention of the 3rd to 12th

Respondents (Respondents) is that the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the instant

Application has been constitutionally precluded under Article 61A of the Constitution. The

Respondents argue that the Petitioner is not entitled to seek any of the reliefs as prayed for in

the prayer of the Petition since this Court, in terms of the said Article 61A, has no power or

jurisdiction to inquire into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call in question the aforesaid

orders made by the PSC. In the meantime, the Petitioner referring to several decided cases

contends that the said Ouster Clause in Article 61A will not be applicable in respect of the

decisions of the PSC which are not taken within the powers of the PSC or its delegated bodies.

Page 5 of 11

Hence, I need to examine the applicability of the said Ouster Clause in the instant Application

while also examining whether this Court can grant any relief to the Petitioner amidst the

decisions taken by the PSC in respect of the interdiction and arrears of salary of the Petitioner.

Shiranee Tilakawardane J. (P/CA) (as she was then) held in Katugampola vs. Commissioner

General of Excise and others (2003) 3 SLR 207 at p.210 as follows;

Therefore, the ouster clauses contained in ordinary legislation would not effectively restrict or

preclude the jurisdiction granted by Article 140 of the Constitution. Nevertheless, the restriction

contained in Article 55 (5) and the Amended Article 61 A as these are ouster clauses stipulated

in the Constitution itself, the powers of this Court would be restricted by these provisions

contained in the Constitution. It was held in the case of Atapattu v Peoples Bank 1997 1 Sri

L.R. 208, Bandaranayake vs. Weeraratne 1981 1 Sri. L.R. 10 at 16, that the ouster clauses

contained in the Constitution would bar jurisdiction that has been granted within the

Constitution and would therefore such ouster clause adverted to above would be a bar to the

entertaining of writ applications to invoke the writ jurisdiction by this Court.

The above perspective has been reflected even in Sirisena vs. Amarasinghe CA/PHC/94/99

(decided on 14.10.2016), W.A.G Weerasinghe vs. P. N. K. Malalasekera and others CA Writ

Application No. 256/2018 (decided on19.03.2021), Gamini Dayarathna vs. P.B.

Wickremarathna and others CA Writ Application No. 347/2018 (decided on 30.04.2020) and

Management Service Officers Association of Sri Lanka Overseas Missions and Others vs. Admiral

Prof. Jayanath Colombage, Secretary to the Foreign Ministry and Others CA/WRIT/0556/2021

decided on 27.01.2022. On the contrary, Shiranee Tilakawardane, J. delving into the essence

of judicial wisdom has observed in the above Katugampola Case that the Writ jurisdiction

could be sought under circumstances where the person who made the impugned decision did

not have any legal authority to make such a decision. The Petitioner based on the precedent

enunciated in the judgements cited by him asserts that the decision of the PSC, dated

05.07.2023 has been taken without legal authority.

In my opinion, what should be meant by the phrase legal authority, that was incorporated

even in the judgement of the said Katugampola case, is to address any incapacitation or

disqualification to function as a member of the PSC or an instance where the PSC assumes

Page 6 of 11

jurisdiction which it does not possess or exceeds its original jurisdiction. Similarly, I am

mindful of the provisions of Article 54 (9) of the Constitution which declares inter alia that

no decision of the PSC shall be or be deemed to be invalid by reason only of any defect in the

appointment of a member. Nevertheless, even if the members of the PSC make an erroneous

decision, if it is within the purview of their duties concerning the matters relating to

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of public officers (as per

Article 55(3) of the Constitution), the Court of Appeal will have no jurisdiction to inquire

into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call in question such a decision as a result of the

said Constitutional Ouster in Article 61A.

The Petitioner placing reliance on the case of Abeywickrama v. Pathirana (1986) 1 Sri. L. R.

120 submits that Article 55(5) of the Constitution did not protect an order or a decision of a

Public Officer which is nullity or ultra vires. The petitioner- appellant of the said case

challenged the election of the relevant Member of Parliament for the Akmeemana Electorate

and thus, it was not a case dealing with the Constitutional Ouster that is discussed in the case

at hand. Moreover, it was a case decided before the 16th and 17th Amendments were made

to the 1978 Constitution. Anyhow, I need to draw my attention to the following phrase of the

eloquent judgement of the said Abeywickrama Case (delivered by Sharvananda C.J. with the

concurrence of Ranasinghe J., Athukorala J. and L.H. De Alwis J.); If an authority is not

competent to pass an order which can be only passed by a superior authority, then the order

passed by him will amount to a nullity and is void. I find it difficult to adopt here the said

dicta enunciated in the said judgement as no adequate material has been provided by the

Petitioner enabling this Court to engage in an exercise of examining whether the PSC had no

jurisdiction to revisit the decision taken previously by the PSC.

As the case may be, in terms of the said Article 61A, such a decision of the PSC to revisit its

earlier decisions in pursuance to disciplinary control (including appointment, promotion and

transfer) of a Public Servant can only be called in question by the Supreme Court (subject to

Article 126) or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Subject to Article 59). Nonetheless, I do

not doubt that the Court of Appeal will have the writ jurisdiction to review the decisions made

by the PSC when there is prima facie material which strongly suggests that the members of

the PSC have exceeded their jurisdiction or one or more sitting members of the PSC are

Page 7 of 11

incapacitated or disqualified to function as a member. In such an event, the Court should first

be satisfied that one or more of the sitting members of the PSC are incapacitated or

disqualified to function as members or that they have assumed a jurisdiction that it does not

possess. I have arrived at the above conclusion enhancing the jurisprudence in the relevant

area of law that was followed by the erudite Judges in the cases cited above.

The Petitioner of this case is not impugning the appointment of the members of the PSC or

taking up similar objections against such members. The submissions of the Petitioner is

mainly focused on the authority of the PSC to revisit a decision taken previously by another

set of members of the PSC. However, it cannot be assumed that the PSC has exceeded its

jurisdiction by revisiting an earlier decision taken by another set of members, as far as the

PSC has not acted beyond the purview declared in Article 55 (3) of the Constitution. Thus, I

am convinced that the PSC has taken both the above decisions on 14.03.2023 and 05.07.2023

with proper legal authority. In light of the above, I am of the view that this Court has no

jurisdiction to review the aforesaid decisions of the PSC, made on 05.07.2023. The said

decision of the PSC to revisit the earlier decision that was made on 14.03.2023 can be inquired

into only by the Supreme Court.

Having considered the application of the said Ouster Clause, I must henceforth examine what

reliefs can be provided to the Petitioner. In regard to this, I need to draw my attention to the

legal provisions upon which the PSC has taken its decision dated 05.07.2023. It can be

assumed that the PSC has taken the said decision in terms of section 27:10 of Chapter XLVIII

of Volume II of the E-Code. The said section 27:10 reads;

27:10:1 However, where legal proceedings are taken against a Public Officer for a

corruption or criminal offence other than a solicitation of bribe or act of

antigovernment or act of terrorism, the Disciplinary Authority / Administrative

Authority should conduct a preliminary investigation against such Officer within a

period not more than 02 months. The respective preliminary investigation report

should be submitted to the Public Service Commission by the Disciplinary Authority

/ Administrative Authority and if the Public Service Commission determines that the

reinstatement of the Officer concerned is not detrimental to the interests of the Public

Page 8 of 11

Service according to facts revealed by such report, such an Officer may be reinstated

in service.

27:10:2 Where the Public Service Commission determines that the reinstatement of

the Officer in service under Sub Section 27:10:1 is detrimental to the interests of the

Public Service, such Officer should be further kept under interdiction pending the

verdict of the Court of Law. If the delivery of the verdict of the Court takes a period

more than one year against such a person, the Disciplinary Authority may authorize

the payment of salary not exceeding half thereof to the Officer concerned.

Thus, it is important to take into consideration the provisions of the above section 27:10:2 in

which it is stipulated unambiguously that the disciplinary authority may authorize the

payment of salary not exceeding half thereof to the officer concerned if the delivery of the

verdict of the Court takes a period more than one year. The Respondents cannot dispute the

fact that a period of more than one year has elapsed from the date of serving the indictment

to the Petitioner in the said case No. HC 1063/2020. Hence, a duty is cast upon the

disciplinary authority in terms of the said section 27:10:2 to exercise its discretion to consider

authorizing a payment of salary not exceeding half thereof to the Petitioner. No material has

been made available to the Court as to why the disciplinary authority should not exercise its

discretion in favor of the Petitioner allowing payment of half the salary to him.

It appears that the Petitioner's rights have been affected as the disciplinary authority has not

arrived at any conclusion giving due effect to the said section 27:10:2, particularly about the

payment of half the salary. It is to be noted that at the time of filing the instant Application,

the Petitioner has not been served with the indictment and also the formal disciplinary inquiry

against the Petitioner was pending. Furthermore, the PSC also made its above decision on

05.07.2023 after the Petitioner filed the instant Application. Considering the Ouster Clause

reflected in Article 61A and the other constitutional provisions regarding the PSC, this Court

needs to give careful consideration to the alleged grievances of the Petitioner as he being a

public servant does not have many forums to seek redress. Hence, I take the view that the

facts and circumstances of this Case are unique for this Court to make an appropriate order

to give due effect to the said section 27:10:2 which deals with the payment of half the salary.

Page 9 of 11

For the reasons set forth above, I firmly believe that this Court has jurisdiction to issue a

mandatory order against the relevant disciplinary authority. What is now known as a

mandatory order was originally referred to in England and Wales as a Writ of Mandamus.

The Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide 20231 England specifically provides in its

Clause 12.2.1 that a mandatory order is an order the Court can make to compel a public body

to act in a particular way. This guide applies to cases heard in the Administrative Court

wherever it is sitting and in the Administrative Court Offices (ACOs) across England and

Wales. I am unwaveringly of the opinion that by issuing such an order this Court will not

engage in an exercise of inquiring into or pronouncing upon or in any manner call into

question any order or decision made by the PSC. Article 61A of the Constitution does not

preclude the Court of Appeal issuing a mandatory order, in a review application, against the

PSC provided that the circumstances for such mandatory order do not stem from any order

or decision previously made by the PSC.

The Rule of Law is promoted, secured and advanced if this Court's jurisdiction is expansive

enough to compel the performance of a duty owed to the public. When Court compels such

a performance the ideals of Rule of Law are advanced. In other words, the concept of Rule of

Law will be enriched when the Court acts so as to operate the law to rule over an inactive

executive or an entity like the PSC. Mark Fernando J. in Atapattu and Others v Peoples Bank

and others (1997) 1 Sri L.R. 208 dealt with the conflicts between the Ouster Clauses in pre-

Constitution legislation and Article 140 of the Constitution. The articulation of Fernando J.

in the said Case was in favor of a jurisdiction which enhances the protection of the Rule of

Law and against an Ouster Clause which tends to undermine it2.

Dr. M.D. W. Lokuge vs. Vidyajothi Dr. Dayasiri Fernando, Chairman of the Public Service

Commission and Others CA/Writ/ 160/2013 decided on 16.10.2015 was a case where the

respective petitioner has prayed for a Writ of Mandamus against the members of the PSC.

His Lordship Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz has concluded inter alia, in the said case that;

1 The Administrative Court Judicial Review Guide (October 2023) <https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/14.317_HMCTS_Administrative_Court_Guide_2023_WEB1.pdf> 2 see pp.221-223 in the said Atapattu Case

Page 10 of 11

" 1. Since the PSC has already acted in the matter it would be futile to mandate them by a

mandamus to act in a particular way in the absence of certiorari that would have the effect of

quashing the decision they have already made.

2. Though it is unfortunate that the Petitioner was not aware of the existence of R3, the decision

of the PSC which the Petitioner possibly came to know only after statement of objection was filed

demonstrates that the PSC has already performed a duty."

I take the view that His Lordship Justice Nawaz was quite emphatic that a Mandamus could

be issued against the PSC provided that it has not taken a decision.

In this regard, one may argue that no Writ of Mandamus can be issued without a demand by

the applicant and also a refusal by the authority. The Petitioner has certainly made a formal

request to reinstate him (see P29). I have decided in the Divisional Bench judgement (with

the concurrence of their Lordships Justice M. T. Mohammed Laffar and Justice Mayadunne

Corea) in Ven. K. Wacheeswara Thero v. Dharmasena Dissanayaka Chairman,The Education

Service Committee of the Public Service Commission, CA/Writ/45/2019 decide on 30.03.2023

that;

Hence, a reasonable question arises in my mind on what grounds our Courts, such as in

Haniffas case, have attempted to limit the expansion of this prerogative remedy completely

overlooking the systematic progress in the relevant field of law and the environment which

prevailed at the birth of Mandamus. The scope of remedy in administrative law has been

expanded with a considerable degree of judicial activism for the last three decades. At a time

where the judges take a liberalized or progressive stand in their judicial creativity to control public

power, I possibly cannot understand why we still need to cling to primitive principles on

Mandamus whereas the English courts themselves have already broken the traditional

parameters and taken drastic measures to use Mandamus as a powerful tool to issue orders in the

mandatory nature against juristic persons such as local government institutions.

Therefore, bearing in mind the effect of the above Article 61A and on careful consideration

of the whole matter, I have come to the conclusion that by reason of the special circumstances

of this case, I should exercise the inherent powers of this Court to issue a mandatory order

against the disciplinary authority of the Petitioner. Hence, I proceed to issue a mandatory

Page 11 of 11

order (writ of Mandamus) against the current members of the PSC compelling them to

exercise their discretion, under the said section 27:10:2 of the E-Code, particularly in reference

to the payment of salary not exceeding half thereof to the Petitioner.

I am aware that the Petitioner has not explicitly sought relief specifically regarding the

payment of half the salary to the Petitioner. However, the legal regime reflected in the

Constitutional provisions relating to the PSC together with the facts and circumstances of this

case give rise for this Court to exercise its inherent powers to grant relief considering the

eminent curtailment of the rights of the Petitioner.
