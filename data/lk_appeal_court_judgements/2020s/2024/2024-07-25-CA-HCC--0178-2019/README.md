The Accused-Appellant, Abdul Hameed Umar Hakthab, was indicted before

the High Court of Anuradhapura together with the second accused on the

following charges:

1. Count No. 1- Both accused were indicted for committing the offence of

conspiracy with Thambi, who is also known as Wasanthan alias

Yakkalamullage Saman Kumara alias Thambi to cause the death of

Major General Janaka Perera, which is an offence punishable under

Section 3(b) read with Section 2(1)(h) of the Prevention of Terrorism

Act No. 48 of 1979 as amended.

2. Count No. 2 Second Accused was indicted for committing the offence

of conspiracy with the said Wasanthan alias Yakkalamullage Saman

Kumara alias Thambi to cause the death of 29 individuals, which is

punishable under Section 3(b) read with Section 2(1)(h) of the

Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979 as amended

3. Counts No. 3 - 31 The Accused Appellant was indicted for abetting

said Wasanthan alias Yakkalamullage Saman Kumara alias Thambi

for causing the death of 29 individuals, which is punishable under

3

Section 3 read with Sections 2(1)(h) and 3(b) of the Prevention of

Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979 as amended.

4. Counts No. 32 -49 The Accused Appellant was indicted abetting said

Wasanthan alias Yakkalamullage Saman Kumara alias Thambi for

causing grievous injuries to 17 individuals, which is punishable under

Section 3 read with Sections 2(1)(h) and 3(c) of the Prevention of

Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979 as amended.

Both accused pleaded not guilty. However, the second accused later

withdrew his plea of non-guilt and pleaded guilty to the first and second

counts of the indictment and the case against the second accused was thus

concluded.

The incident relates to the tragic death of the retired army officer, Major

General Janaka Perera, along with 29 other individuals due to the suicide

bomb blast that happened on 06.10.2008, at the Anuradhapura Party Office

opening ceremony. Further, 17 other individuals sustained grievous injuries

in the explosion. During Major General Janaka Perera's address to the

crowd, a person in a blue checked shirt approached him and detonated an

explosive device.

Prosecution version

The prosecution witness (PW13), Abdul Ali, is the main witness who testified

for the prosecution. PW13 stated that the accused-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the appellant) introduced a young boy around 19 years old,

stating that the boys father was involved in treasure hunting and requested

PW13 to accommodate him at his house in Gampola. Accordingly, Thambi

was accommodated at PW13s house and alternatively at the house of the

father of the appellant which was located close to Anuradhapura. The

witness said that he did not ask the boy's name and referred to him as

Thambi. On the day of the incident, Thambi was at the appellants fathers

house. PW13 left the appellants fathers house with the appellant and

4

Thambi to travel to Anuradhapura. PW13 travelled by bus, while the

appellant and Thambi arrived on a motorcycle belonging to the appellant.

Three of them met for tea at a tea kiosk near the bus stand in

Anuradhapura. While they were having tea, the appellant left alone on his

motorcycle to somewhere and returned back shortly. He then asked Thambi

to go to his village. Then the appellant and PW 13 left for Gampola, on his

motorcycle. On their way to Gampola, the appellant received a phone call.

The appellant stopped the motorcycle and answered the call. After the call,

he asked PW13 to put a high five. When PW13 inquired about why he was

asked to put a high five, he was told that Thambi entered the premises

where the explosion took place and died along with Major General Janaka

Perera.

The version of the defence.

As per the appellant, he became acquainted with PW13 through a mutual

friend during their involvement in politics. PW13 requested him to keep his

son at his house due to his sons involvement with a Sinhalese girl. He then

kept PW13s son at his fathers house. On the day of the incident, the

appellant wanted to go to Colombo. On his way to Colombo, the appellant

made a call to PW13 to inquire about where he was. He then told the

appellant that he was on his way to Kalmunai with his son and that he was

currently in Anuradhapura. Coincidentally, the appellant was also in

Anuradhapura at that time and requested PW13 to wait for him. He then

attended the Party office opening ceremony in Anuradhapura, having been

invited by Major General Janaka Pereras wife. Following the event, he met

PW13 and proposed travelling together to Kandy, expressing his intention to

collect law notes from a friend there. Accompanied by PW13, the appellant

travelled to Kandy while PW13s son proceeded to Ampara, Kalmunai.

At the conclusion of the Trial, the Learned Trial Judge convicted the

appellant for 1st to 31st charges and acquitted him for 32nd to 49th charges

and gave the following sentences:

5

1. 20 years of rigorous imprisonment for 1st and 3rd counts.

2. Life imprisonment for 4th to 31st counts.

3. Jail terms for each count are to be run consecutively, especially the 1st

and 3rd counts.

4. Movable and immovable property of the Accused-Appellant and the

liquid cash were to be confiscated and vested with the State.

Being aggrieved by the above-mentioned conviction and sentence, the

appellant had preferred this appeal to this court on the following grounds of

appeal:

1. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to evaluate and analyze the

evidence placed before the court in light of well-established principles of testimonial credibility and consistency. 2. The prosecution has failed to discharge its burden of proof beyond

reasonable doubt.

3. The court has permitted itself to be misled in matters of Law and

Procedure, particularly in accepting productions and documents submitted to the court.

4. The Learned Trial Judge has erred and misdirected herself with regard

to the Legal Principles applicable to the evaluation of the Dock Statement made by the Accused-Appellant.

5. The prosecution failed and neglected to present contemporaneous

evidence of persons and technical and scientific evidence, including the video filmed at the scene of the incident.

6. The evidence led at the Trial connecting the Accused-Appellant with the

conspiracy charge lacks credibility.

7. The Learned Trial Judge failed to analyze and consider the

contradictions and inaccuracies in the evidence of PW13, the only witness connecting the Accused Appellant to the incident.

8. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to evaluate properly the evidence of

the eyewitness to the scene whose evidence incident contains serious

6

contradictions, the benefit of which ought to have been decided in favor of the Accused-Appellant.

9. Although numerous potential eyewitnesses were present at the scene,

including those injured in the incident, only a selected few were called to give evidence, which raises grave doubts about the prosecution's case.

As most of the grounds of appeal are interwoven and overlap with each

other, all these grounds of appeal will be considered as a whole.

This case is based on direct and circumstantial evidence. PW13, the main

witness who testified for the prosecution, identified the person in the

photographs marked P1 and P2 taken from the video footage, as the person

who claims to be Thambi. Both PW 14 and PW161, the eyewitnesses to the

incident, also testified that they saw a person going through the crowd

towards Major General Janaka Perera and tugging his shirt, resulting in an

explosion. Therefore, the testimonies of PW14 and PW161 corroborate each

other in describing the events leading up to the explosion.

PW161 identified the person who caused the explosion as the person seen in

photographs marked P1 and P2. Both PW13 and PW161 identified the

person in the photographs as the same person involved in the incident.

PW13 stated that the suicide bomber was wearing a blue colour short-

sleeved checked shirt. PW14 and PW161, who had seen the explosion, also

stated that the suicide bomber was wearing a blue colour short-sleeve

checked shirt. Further, PW48, after watching the video, confirmed that the

suicide bomber was wearing a blue colour short-sleeved checked shirt (page

391-392-393 High Court Judge recorded that the permission was granted to

exhibit the video on a white screen set up in the court, which was clearly

visible to the lawyers, the accused and the High Court Judge). Further,

PW48 on the basis of the appellants statement found a blue color checked

shirt from a shop called ASB, near the old bus stand in Anuradhapura,

which was similar to the shirt displayed in the photographs P1 and P2.

7

On the other hand, PW47, the Additional Government Analyst and acting

Government Analyst, observed fragments of clothing marked P8A and P8B,

which consisted of a section of the back of the shirt and two sleeves. These

pieces, which were characterized by a blue check design, were found on the

ground following the explosion. It was also found that the collar of the shirt

bore a trademark label stating EQI.

As PW13 stated that, while Thambi, the appellant and PW13 were having tea

at the Tea Kiosk, the appellant had left to somewhere on his motorcycle. The

appellant then returned and asked Thambi to leave. The appellant, in his

dock statement, stated that he had gone to the Party Office opening

ceremony, talked with Major General Janaka Pereras wife, and then had

met PW13 and the young boy. The appellant admitted that he had met

PW13 on the day of the incident, along with the young person whom he says

to be the son of PW13. He states that the said son of PW13 left for

Kalmunai. Then, he along with PW13, left for Kandy on his motorcycle. This

confirms that the young person (Thambi) had left before PW13 and the

appellant leaving for Kandy. The appellant by his dock statement admitted

the fact that the young person left before them.

As for PW13, in his cross-examination states ;

By putting the above questions the defense also concedes some of the

evidence of PW13.

The appellants position in his dock statement is that PW13 had an elder

brother at Kalmunai. When he telephoned PW13 on the day of the incident,

PW13 told him that PW13 was at Anuradhapura with his son on their way

to Kalmunai. However, no questions were asked from PW13 on behalf of the

appellant whether PW13 had a brother at Kalmunai, or whether the person

who is said to be the son of PW13 had left for Kalmunai.

On the other hand, PW14, in his evidence, also stated that he received a call

from the appellant and inquired whether PW14 would participate in the

Party Opening Ceremony. PW14 testified that the appellant and PW14 had

studied in the same school at Kurunegala and the appellant was senior to

him and they were known to each other from school days. PW14 witnessed

the presence of the appellant at the main entrance prior to the opening

ceremony. This also confirms the version of PW13 that the appellant had

gone away on his motorcycle. The defense, however, has not challenged the

fact that he gave a call to PW14 on the day of the incident in the morning,

that PW14 had seen the appellant at the main entrance, and that they had

known each other from school days. The defense also did not challenge that

he left on his motorcycle while PW13 and Thambi were having tea. The fact

that the defense did not challenge the testimony of PW13 and PW14

indicates that the appellant has conceded them.

The defence has not cross-examined on certain material points of the

evidence for the prosecution.

9

In the case of Sarwan Singh vs State of Punjab decided on 07th October

2002, the Supreme Court of India held,It is a rule of essential justice that

whenever the opponent has declined to avail himself of the opportunity to put

his case in cross-examination it must follow that the evidence tendered on

that issue ought to be accepted.

The law, in this regard, is found in the decision in Dadimuni Indrasena

&DadimuniWimalasena Vs. The Attorney General CA 135/2003 decided on

10/06/2008 as follows;

Whenever the evidence given by a witness on a material point is not

challenged in cross examination it has to be concluded that such evidence is

not disputed and is accepted by the opponent.

The uncontested evidence referred to in this case could be considered as

reliable evidence.

Both PW13 and the appellant stated that they got to know each other

through a person who was engaged in politics. At that time, the appellant

was a supporter of the Mayor (pages 10-11 of brief) in Gampola. PW13

stated that the appellant had told him that he worked as a bodyguard to a

Minister. The defence, however, has not denied the evidence of PW13 that

they were known to each other prior to the incident. Further, the appellant

has not challenged the evidence of PW13 that he kept the suicide bomber at

his house on several occasions at the request of the appellant.

The appellants narrative involves several improbable co-incidences, such as

the co-incidence of meeting with PW13 in Anuradhapura before 7.00am on

the same day of the incident. However, the evidence of PW13 shows that all

three were met at the appellants fathers house. The appellant asked PW13

to go to Anuradhapura by bus, whereas Thambi and the appellant went to

Anuradhapura on the appellants motorcycle. Further, they met near the

Anuradhapura bus stand as agreed.

10

PW13 says that the appellant has asked PW13 to put a high-five on their

way to Gampola. The celebratory nature of high five is grossly

inappropriate in the context of a tragic explosion that resulted in multiple

deaths. This behavior suggests a lack of remorse, which would be expected

from an innocent person learning about such a devastating event. Instead, it

implies satisfaction or relief, further indicating the appellants prior

knowledge of Thambis actions and explosion, which is consistent with

PW13s testimony, but contradicts the appellants claim of innocence. The

appellant, however, did not seriously challenge the above stance taken by

PW13.

It has been suggested to PW13 as follows, which he had denied.

e:

e

?

: . .

PW13 denied the above-mentioned suggestion as a total lie and stated that

he was hearing it for the first time. The Defence Counsel suggested this

question almost at the end of the cross-examination. Prior to that, the

defence Counsel always referred to Thambi as a young man and not as

PW13s son in his questions. This shift in the defence appears to be a

desperate attempt to deflect blame from the appellant. If the defense

genuinely believed that PW13s son or the person who was said to be the son

of PW13 was the suicide bomber, this position should have been confronted

to PW13 earlier in the trial process. On the other hand, if there were any

prior statements made by PW13 that contradicted his response to the

defenses new allegation, the defense would have marked these

contradictions to challenge his credibility. The absence of any contradictions

clearly demonstrates that PW13s evidence is consistent with his statements

to the police. On the other hand, the above suggestion implies that both

PW13 and the appellant referred to the same person.

11

The Counsel questioned on the following;

If the young boy is PW13's son, it raises the question as to why the

appellant bought him medicine.

Further, PW13 stated that the young boy was accompanied from PW13s

home to the appellants fathers home 4 or 5 times at the appellant's request.

The above questions imply that the person in P1 and P2 photographs was

the person who had been given lodging at the house of PW13.

PW 121 Leelawathie Perera Siriwardena identified the National Identity Card

of her deceased son Yakkalamullege Saman Kumara, who was an army

soldier who died in action on 07-06-2007 in Vauniyawa. She further stated

that she had received the sealed dead body. The body was found by the Red

Cross. She also stated that she had not received the National Identity Card

of her son. She also stated that P14 is her son's Identity Card, but the

photo fixed on it is not her sons photo, and the person on the photo is

unknown to her.

13

By this evidence, the prosecution proved the fact that the suicide bomber

had used the National Identity Card of a deceased soldier in order to conceal

his identity by removing the soldiers photograph and substituting it with a

different photograph.

The appellant states that his primary source of income was from the spices

business. However, the other evidence indicates that the appellant did not

have employment or any stable income. PW 105 Samsudeen Mohomed

Azwar stated in his evidence that he had worked as an authorized foreign

currency ex-changer at No. 53 B York Street, Colombo 01. He knew a

person named Ali (PW13), who had been introduced by the accountant of his

company, and Ali was not a financially well-off person. Ali introduced a

person named Umar Hakthab to the witness in 2008. PW105 stated that

the appellant had given Rs. 3.3 million in total on two occasions to the

witness to exchange it for dollars. He further stated that he had handed

over Rs. 3.3 million to the CID in March 2009. This witness identified the

appellant at the trial.

The defence suggested that the money was given by the appellant in order to

invest. However, PW105 denied that this money was intended for

investment; instead, he affirmed that it was given to him to convert into US

dollars. This fact implies that regardless of the intended purpose

(investment or currency exchange), the appellant had given a significant

sum of money to PW105. On the other hand, this evidence draws the

inference that the appellant had a large amount of money in his possession.

However, he has not explained how he earned that amount of money.

Further, the appellant has not denied the above version of PW105 in his

dock statement. Further, PW162 W.P.C. Medagedara produced documents

marked P45 and P46 and identified her signature on those documents. P45

and P46 are official receipts issued by the Criminal Investigation

Department, which states that Rs. 1.0 million and Rs.2,324,200/= is from

S.M Asfar (PW105).

14

PW 76 Segu Mohideen Mallika Umma stated that she had worked abroad for

4 to 5 years, and she had deposited money in her account from time to time

while she was abroad. She is the sister-in-law of the appellant, who testified

that the appellant had deposited Rs. 600,000/- in her bank account at

Peoples Bank and asked her to give the money to his wife. According to this

witness, the wife of the appellant was living in the same house at that time.

PW 101 was the Assistant Manager of the Peoples Bank, Medawachchiya

Branch. He gave evidence regarding the account details of the appellant and

Segu Mohideen Mallika. According to his evidence, the bank account of the

appellant was active from 27-06-2005 until October 2008. Also, the savings

account of Segu Mohideen Mallika, which was opened in January 1991, was

active from 08-11-2005 to 18-11-2008.

The appellant has not explained the Rs.3,324,200/= given to S. M Asfar

(PW105), the Rs 600,000/= deposited in his sister-in-laws account, or the

Rs.1,500,000/= deposited in his bank account in October 2008. The

appellant travelled to India with PW 13 after the bomb incident and the

appellant converted Rs 400,000/= into US dollars. Further, PW130, who

personally knew the appellant for a considerable time before the incident,

reveals the appellants financial background, stating that he had not

possessed a two-storied, tiled house when he visited his house, but he had a

small hut as the house which is not even built properly. PW76, the sister-

in-law of the appellant, in her evidence, says that the appellant was

unemployed. This evidence was not challenged in cross-examination.

The evidence indicates that the appellant, who had no employment or

source of income, received a considerable amount of money both before and

after the bomb blast.

PW 112 was a Lieutenant attached to the army at the time of the incident

and was assigned to work in Weerapuram village. It was his duty to identify

temporary residence persons in that area and to keep records of residence

certificates issued to them by the Grama Niladari. This witness further

15

stated that he was informed of a person who was building an unusually big

house near the mosque at Maha Siyambalagaskada Wewa. He further

stated that he had visited that house and inquired about this information

and searched the house. He had found many people from the Puttalam

area. He had advised the wife of the appellant to inform her husband to

supply details to the Grama Niladari. Later, the appellant met him and

produced his National Identity Card. The appellant further stated to him

that he was working under Keheliya Rambukkwella, and the house had

been constructed to throw a party for the ministers. This witness had

identified the appellant in the dock.

The above evidence supports the fact that the appellant constructed a large

house, considering his unstable income, which appeared to be unusually

large compared to the others in the area. It has also confirmed that the

appellant had been in association with strangers in that area.

Further, the defence did not suggest that PW13s evidence against the

appellant was false or motivated by animosity. This lack of suggestion

implies that the defence has not claimed that PW13s testimony was

dishonest or biased due to personal animosity towards the appellant.

One of the grounds of appeal is that the prosecution failed and neglected to

present contemporaneous evidence of persons and technical and scientific

evidence. However, what contemporaneous or technical evidence the

prosecution could have presented was not suggested. The prosecution

exhibited the available video that was filmed at the scene of the incident.

The investigations have been handed over to the Criminal Investigation

Department. PW48 obtained the video (which was recovered from the scene)

from the Magistrates Court on 9.1.2009. The photograph marked P1 has

been extracted from this video.

According to the evidence of PW48, he had received information that the

suspect was at Maha Siyambalagaskada Wewa, Madawachchiya, on

07.02.2009. After that, the witness went to look for the suspect named

16

Umar Hakthab, but he failed to find the suspect. He had received

information about the suspect that he was not born in that area; he was

from the Muslim village of Ikirigollawa, and his father was a Tamil person.

This witness also received information that the suspect had visited the

residence of the mayor of Gampola. Later, he learned that the suspect was

in a house at Indra Mawatha, Kalubowila.

The appellant was arrested at a place in Kalubowila, and there they found

the appellants driving licence, national identity card, and civil security

identity card, which was issued to him under the signature of OIC

Madawachchiya Police Station, a document granting permission to go via

Madawachchiya barrier issued by ASP, road barrier, a revenue licence for

NCJF 6544, insurance certificate, two mobile phones and two other

additional SIM cards. This witness also found a cyanide capsule inside the

switch board of the suspects house at Maha Siyambalagaskada Wewa,

based on the statement of the appellant. This cyanide capsule was probably

the one that was kept by the suicide bomber (Thambi).

The defence cross-examined PW 48 as to why the video had been kept in his

private possession and raised the possibility of tampering or editing while it

was in PW48s private possession. However, the mere fact of the video being

in private possession is not enough to raise concerns; rather, the concern

would be valid only if there is evidence of tampering or editing while it was

held privately. The video was played in the High Court of Anuradhapura on

29.03.2016. However, no allegations had been made at the trial as to the

accuracy of the said video, alleging that it was altered or tampered with.

The defence never suggested to PW48 or to any other witness that the video

was tampered with. The defence never suggested to any witness if the video

was tampered with or how such tampering could be helpful to the

prosecutions case. The video was used only to identify the suicide bomber

and to make P1 and P2 photographs.

17

Section 4(5) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No.14 of 1995 ensures

that duplicates of evidence are admissible under the same conditions as the

original evidence.

Section 4(5) of Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No.14 of 1995 states as follows:

Where evidence is admissible under the preceding provisions of this

section, a duplicate of such evidence shall be admissible in the same

manner and to the same extent as the source from which the duplicate

is made.

In view of the above circumstances, the contention of the defense Counsel

that the video evidence was improperly admitted is without merit and I

reject that contention.

The main ground of appeal argued for the appellant is that the evidence of

PW13 is not reliable and should not have been believed to convict the

appellant. However, the Learned Trial Judge carefully considered the

evidence of PW13 along with the evidence of the other witnesses and found

that it was consistent with the evidence of other witnesses.

Ajit Samarakoon v The Republic (Kobaigane Murder Case) 217 [2004] 2 Sri L

R209, F.N.D. Jayasuriya, J. stated as follows:

In this context, it is relevant to consider the issue of the credibility of the

witness Chulasiri in the light of the principles enunciated by Lord Roch in

Bhojraj v Sita Ram- Lord Roche has set out the real test for rejecting or

accepting on the basis of testimonial trustworthiness in these words:

How consistent is the story with itself? (consistency per se). How does it

stand the test of cross-examination? (stability under cross-examination) How

far it fits in with the rest of the evidence and the circumstances of the case

(inconsistency 260 inter se)".

18

The evidence of PW13 is neither contradictory per se, nor contradictory inter

se. Having perused the entirety of PW13's evidence I find his testimony to be

reliable.

PW 132 Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) performed a post-mortem

examination of 30 deceased persons, including 29 known persons and one

unknown person. This witness had visited the crime scene with the

Magistrate. The JMO was of the opinion that the position of the dead bodies

and the damage caused to them suggested that there had been a bomb

blast. The JMO has further observed two unknown legs, believed to be of

one persons, on the floor of the crime scene and a crushed head.

The evidence of the JMO proved the fact that the 29 people, including Major

General Janaka Perera, had died consequent to a bomb blast.

PW 116 was a police inspector at the time of the incident, and he was

assigned to investigate the bomb blast on 06-10-2008. He had provided a

detailed description of the surroundings of the crime scene. He had

prepared a rough sketch of the crime scene marked as P47. He also noticed

22 dead bodies and two legs spread around the floor. According to this

witness, the Magistrate, the JMO and the Government Analyst had visited

the crime place. Also, the witness had observed certain parts which could

be identified as a blasted bomb and the pieces of the shirt, iron balls and

parts of the bomb jacket.

The evidence of the above witness verifies the fact that there was a bomb

blast, and many people died as a result of it.

PW163, an assistant controller of the Department of Immigration and

Emigration, identified document P58 as an application for a passport, and

accordingly, a passport was issued to Abdul Ahmed Umar Hakthab under

the number N2218676 dated 10.11.2008. PW13 testified that he travelled to

19

India with the appellant after the bomb incident. This is probably to evade

arrest.

The appellant was convicted for conspiring to commit or abet along with the

deceased suicide bomber known as Wasanthan alias Thambi, to cause the

deaths of 29 persons with the intention of killing Major General Janaka

Perera and also causing religious, racial or communal disharmony or

feelings of ill will or hostility between different communities or racial or

religious groups, offences punishable under section 2(1)(g) and 3(a) of the

Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act No 48 of 1979 as

amended by Act No.10 of 1982 and Act No.22 of 1988 read with sections

113B,102 of the Penal Code.

Section 113A(1) of the Penal Code states as follows:

If two or more persons agree to commit or abet or act together with a common

purpose for or in committing or abetting an offence, whether with or without

any previous concert or deliberation, each of them is guilty of the offence of

conspiracy to commit or abet that offence, as the case may be.

In the case of the King v. Cooray 51 N.L.R. 433, the Supreme Court held that The commission of the offence of conspiracy is established within the meaning

of section 113A of the Penal Code in one or the other of the following

circumstances: -

(a) if two or more persons agree, with or without any previous concert or

deliberation, to commit an offence or to abet an offence, or (b) if two or more

persons agree, with or without any previous concert or deliberation, to act

together with a common purpose for or in committing or abetting an offence.

In the case of The King v. Andree et alit was stated as follows: .In regard to this contention, under our law the position appears to be, as I

have pointed out, that it is not necessary to prove agreement, either directly or

20

inferentially. It is sufficient to prove that the accused acted together with a

com m on purpose for or in committing an offence.

The Learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the Learned High

Court Judge accepted the evidence without evaluating it judicially and also

admitted inadmissible evidence, which prejudiced the appellant.

The evidence clearly indicates that who the suicide bomber was and the

appellant knew the suicide bomber for a considerable period before the

incident. During the time that the suicide bomber was at PW13s place, the

expenses for travelling with the suicide bomber were borne by the appellant.

The Government Analyst described the nature of the bomb blast, and it was

such that it could affect many peoples lives in the surroundings. The above

evidence is sufficient to come to the conclusion that the appellant

deliberately facilitated the assassination of Major General Janaka Perera,

and the other persons died from the bomb blast.

The prosecution has established that the appellant and the suicide bomber,

Wasanthan alias Thambi, came together to Anuradhapura on 06.10.2008.

According to the evidence of PW13, the appellant and the suicide bomber

had come to Anuradhapura from the appellants fathers house on the

appellants motorcycle. PW13 also came from that house to Anuradhapura

by bus. The appellant, the suicide bomber and PW13 had tea together at a

place near the old bus stand in Anuradhapura. The appellant had gone

somewhere and came back while PW13 and the suicide bomber were at the

tea kiosk. The evidence of PW14 confirms that the appellant was at the main

gate of Major General Janaka Pereras house on the date of the bomb blast.

The appellant himself admitted that he had gone to that place in the

morning and met Mrs. Perera. PW14 also stated that he had seen the

appellant at some other meetings of Major General Janaka Perera, held

previously.

The evidence indicates that the appellant and the suicide bomber had pre-

planned to assassinate Major General Janaka Perera. According to the

21

evidence of PW13, the appellant asked PW13 to provide lodging at his place

to a person who was later identified as the suicide bomber. The appellant

came to Anuradhapura on the day of the incident with the suicide bomber,

and he had directed the bomber to go for his mission.

When considering the above-mentioned evidence as a whole, the conviction

was based on sufficient evidence. The allegation that the Learned High

Court Judge accepted the evidence without evaluating it judicially has no

merit; thus, I reject that argument.

For the reasons enumerated in the judgment, we do not see sufficient

grounds to interfere with the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge

dated 21.05.2019. Therefore, the appeal of the appellant is dismissed.

However, considering the time the appellant has been in custody up to date,

we order that all sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. We make

no other changes to the punishments imposed by the Learned High Court

Judge.

Judge of the Court of Appeal. M.C.B.S. Morais J. I agree. Judge of the Court of Appeal.
