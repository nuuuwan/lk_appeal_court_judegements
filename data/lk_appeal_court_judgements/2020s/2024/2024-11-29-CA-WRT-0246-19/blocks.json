The Circular No. SCL 2009/003 had been issued unilaterally without the employees' consent. The 1st Respondent's position is that the age of retirement is determined by the letter of appointment and mutually revised by Circular No. SCL 2008/043. Therefore, this age of retirement cannot be unilaterally changed by the issuance of Circular No. SCL 2009/003. Consequently, it is claimed that the 2nd Respondent does not cease to be an employee of the Petitioner Bank upon reaching the age of 55 years. Hence, the decision of the Petitioner bank to send the 2nd Respondent on retirement at the age of 57 years was made without consensus ad idem and amounted to a termination of employment.",

By said decision, the 1st Respondent has come to a finding that the Petitioner has terminated the services of the 2nd Respondent contrary to the provisions of the TEWA. Concerns were raised about the unilateral issuance of Circular X3 by the Petitioner Bank without obtaining any views on it from its employees. Therefore, it is claimed that Circular X3 is neither an effective agreement nor a confirmatory document to that extent. Hence, it is contended that the contractually valid retirement age is 58 years as reflected in X2. This Court has to consider whether the reasons given by the 1st Respondent in arriving at his conclusion bear any illegality or irrationality which comes under the purview of writ jurisdiction.",

However, subsequently, the age of retirement was amended or varied by Circulars bearing No. SCL 2001/10 dated 13th March 2001[X4], No. SCL 2008/043 dated 19th September 2008[X2] and No. SCL 2009/003 dated 19 March 2009[X3]. It is on common ground that the 2nd Respondent reached the age of 55 years on the 28th of May 2016. At the time when the 2nd Respondent reached the age of 55 years, the existing Circular applicable on the age of retirement of the employees of the Petitioner Bank was Circular X3. As per Circular X3, the age of retirement was set as 55 years giving effect to the relevant Public Administration Circular. Further, Circular X3 stipulates that extensions would be granted to the employees annually until they reach the age of 57 years subject to evaluation of performances and the discretion of the Management. The extension for highly skilled employees who could not be easily replaced and who will contribute to the bottom line directly could be granted annually until they reach the age of 60 years. Further, Circular X3 expressly rescinded Circular X2 by which the age of retirement was extended to the age of 58 years. Therefore, the Petitioner contends that the 2nd Respondent ceased to be an employee of the Petitioner Bank upon reaching the age of 55 years as per Circular X3 and no termination of services had occurred.",
