JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)

has been indicted in the High Court of Anuradhapura in Case

No.189/2010.

2. The charges in the indictment are as follows;

i. That on or about 11.05.2006, at Idhigollagama, in

the District of Anuradhapura within the jurisdiction

3

of this Court you did commit murder by causing the

death of Kahatapitiya Kangkanamlage Somasena

Perera; and that you have thereby committed an

offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal

Code.

ii. That on or about 11.05.2006, at Idhigollagama, in

the District of Anuradhapura within the jurisdiction

of this Court you did commit murder by causing the

death of Jayasinghe Arachchige Somawathie; and

that you have thereby committed an offence

punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

3. Upon the indictment being received the Learned High Court Judge

has caused the appellant to appear before Court, served a copy of

the indictment with its annexures on the appellant and enlarged

the latter on bail.

4. On the date set for the appellant to furnish bail, the Counsel of

the appellant has made an application to Court stating his

inability to defend his client in the future. In those circumstances,

the Learned High Court Judge has assigned a Counsel to the

appellant.

5. On 24.03.2015, the Learned High Court Judge has attempted to

read and explain the charges in the indictment and asked the

appellant as to whether he is guilty or not guilty to the offences

stated in the charges in the indictment. The appellant at that

instance had made several utterances which lacked substance.

4

The unusual behaviour of the appellant has prompted the Learned

High Court Judge to order the prison officials to produce the

appellant before the national institute of mental health and

forward to Court a report on the mental health of the appellant.

Thereafter, the appellant has been admitted to such institute on

29.10.2017. The appellant has received treatment as an indoor

patient and a report has been forwarded to Court dated

21.04.2017. The report on the mental health of the appellant has

been prepared by Dr. T. S. S. Mendis (Acting Consultant, Forensic

Psychiatrist, Forensic Psychiatry Unit National Institute of Health,

Angoda).

6. Subsequent to treatment and the appellant being deemed fit to

plead and stand trial, the appellant has been brought before High

Court of Anuradhapura and the trial commenced without a jury.

At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

convicted the appellant for both offences stated in the charges in

the indictment and sentenced him to death.

7. Aggrieved by the judgment and the sentencing order, the appellant

has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

8. The grounds of appeal formulated by the Counsel for the appellant

are as follows;

i. Has the Learned High Court Judge failed to properly

evaluate the facts and the circumstances of the case

when arriving at the finding of guilt of the appellant?

5

ii. Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law by

concluding that the alleged statements made by the

deceased-female to PW-03 and PW-15 are dying

declarations in terms of Section 32 (1) of the Evidence

Ordinance?

9. The deceased, the male (hereinafter referred to as the deceased-

male) and the female (hereinafter referred to as the deceased-

female) have been living in a hut built on a land belonging to the

appellants father, i.e. PW-03, and had been engaged in farming.

PW-02 has cultivated a plot of land which was situated across the

hut in which the deceased lived in. On 11.05.2006, PW-02 has

been engaged in the process of preparing his land for cultivation.

PW-02 has used a tractor for such purpose and also a person by

the name of Padma Kumara has assisted him in such endeavour.

PW-02 has gone to the hut occupied by the deceased-male and

the deceased-female on two occasions that morning, for the

purpose of quenching his thirst; once at about 09.30 hrs and the

next at about 11.30 hrs. On his first visit, only the deceased-

female had been in the hut. When he visited the hut for the

second time, PW-02 has observed that the deceased-male, the

deceased-female and the appellant were inside the hut. The

appellant had had in his possession an axe.

10. PW-02 upon quenching his thirst for the second time has

returned to the plot of land, he was preparing for cultivation

purposes and has continued to engage in such process. After some

time, the appellant has come running towards PW-02 and stated

that he had cut with heavy blows a person () but not stated

as to who the victim was.

6

11. PW-02 has informed PW-03 (the father of the appellant, as he

was the owner of the land on which the hut the deceased lived in

was built) about the alleged incident stated to him by the

appellant. PW-03 thereafter had gone into the hut occupied by the

deceased. PW-03 had observed the deceased-male and the

deceased-female lying injured in the hut. He has also observed

that the deceased-male had passed away by that time. The

deceased-female on being questioned by PW-03 as to who was

responsible for the injuries inflicted on the deceased-female, the

latter has stated (). Subsequently, the deceased-female has

been hospitalised for treatment. The deceased-female has passed

away on 18.05.2006, while receiving treatment in the hospital as

an indoor patient.

12. While the deceased-female was receiving treatment at the

Colombo National Hospital, PS37576 Epa, while investigating the

incident has visited the deceased-female in hospital and has

inquired from the latter as to who inflicted the injuries on her. PW-

11 [PS8522, Ashoka], who was in the ward with PS37576 Epa,

has overheard the deceased-female state to PS37576 Epa that it

was Nandana Rathnayake who inflicted the injuries on her.

13. PW-15, Dr. Nigamani Allagiyawanna has examined the deceased-

female when she was hospitalised and obtained a short history

from the deceased-female, who was an indoor patient at that time.

The deceased-female giving such history has stated that she was,

assaulted using an axe by Nandana.

7

14. PW-13, Dr. Ajith Jayasena has conducted the post-mortem

examination on the deceased-male and prepared a post-mortem

report. Such report has been marked as -2. PW-14 Dr.

P.H.R.S.Senathilaka, has conducted the post-mortem examination

on the deceased-female and prepared a post-mortem report; such

report has been marked -3.

15. PW-13 has observed four cut injuries on the deceased-male,

three of those injuries had been on the head and neck area. The

other on the right upper limb. The injury to the neck had been on

the right side of the neck. Corresponding to such injury,

underlying soft tissues, muscles on the posterolateral aspect of

the neck, nerves, also the fifth and sixth vertebral bodies have

been cut. PW-13 has opined that the deep cut injury to the neck

has caused the death of the deceased-male.

16. PW-14 has observed the following injuries on the body of the

deceased-female;

i. Scabbed abrasion on the left cheek.

ii. Surgically altered healing sutured cut injury on the left

side of the face.

iii. Surgically altered healing sutured cut injury on the

back of the head and correspondingly a cut fracture of

the scalp, a sutured cut injury of the dura-matter of the

brain and a laceration of the brain.

iv. Healing sutured cut injury on the back of the left

shoulder.

8

PW-14 has opined that the cut injury to the head as well as

the corresponding injury to the skull and the brain had

caused the death of the deceased-female.

17. The approximate time and the date of the death of the deceased-

male has been confirmed by PW-13. Accordingly, PW-13 has

recorded the time of death as 10.30 hrs on 11.05.2006.

18. At about 11.30 hrs on 11.05.2006, the deceased-male, the

deceased-female and the appellant have been together in the hut

occupied by both deceased. The appellant at that time had had in

his possession an axe. A little after 11.30 hrs, the appellant has

confessed to PW-02 that he hit and cut someone in a rough

manner, . Probing such confession has culminated in the

recovery of the deceased-male and the deceased-female with

serious injuries inflicted on them in the hut they lived in. The

deceased-male had passed away at the scene while the deceased-

female who was in a serious condition had been admitted to the

hospital for treatment. The testimony is that the injuries to both

the deceased had been caused by using a sharp weapon which

was heavy, one similar to an axe. The female-deceased has made

verbal statements naming the person who inflicted the injuries

on her.

19. Section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance No.15 of 1895 provides,

Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the

9

case, appears to the court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases: -

(1) When the statement is made by a person as

to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that persons death comes into question. Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the proceedings in which the cause of his death comes into question

20. Furthermore, Illustration (a) to Section 32 of the

Evidence Ordinance provides,

The question is, whether A was murdered by B, or whether A died of injuries received in a transaction in the course of which she was ravished. The question is, whether she was ravished by B; or

The question is, whether A was killed by B under such circumstances that a suit would lie against B by As widow.

Statements made by A as to the cause of his or her death, referring respectively to the murder, the rape, and the actionable wrong under consideration, are relevant facts.

21. The verbal statements made by the deceased-female to PW-03,

PW-15 and PS37576 Epa which was overheard by PW-11 being

in reference the transaction which resulted in the death of the

deceased-female, though hearsay could be admitted as evidence

as they are in the nature of dying declarations as per the

10

provisions in Section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance No.15 of

1895.

22. The narrations of PW-03, PW-11 and PW-15 have established

that the person referred to in the statements of the deceased-

female as the person who inflicted the injuries on the latter to be

the appellant. Though the appellant has been referred to as

and Nandana in those verbal statements, there is no

testimony to suggest that there were multiple people with the

same name in the village the appellant lived in. It has also been

established that the appellant was referred to as and

Nandana therefore there is no ambiguity that the person

referred to in those statements is none other but the appellant.

Further, the deceased-female have made one such verbal

statement to PW-15 Dr. R. Allagiyawanna when she examined the

former as an indoor patient in the hospital. Though such verbal

statement has been in the Sinhala language, PW-15 has

translated the same to the english language. No evidence has been

elicited to establish the fact that such translation was done

incorrectly. PW-11 also had perceived such a statement when the

deceased-female made such statement, while receiving treatment

as an indoor patient in the hospital. No evidence has been elicited

to reveal that the deceased-females condition so was serious that

she was unable to speak while receiving treatment as an indoor

patient. The matters referred to above establish the fact that the

deceased-female had been able to speak soon after the injuries

were inflicted on her and also after she had been hospitalised for

treatment.

11

23. In Sigera vs. Attorney General [2011] 1 SLR 201, Ranjith

Silva J, has held,

- Under our law a dying declaration can be admitted in

evidence under Section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance.

One of the salient features discernible in this section is

that the declaration may be written or oral. Even a sign

made by a person who is unable to speak is caught up in

this phrase.

- First and foremost a judge must apply in his mind and

decide whether the dying declaration is a true and

accepted statement in doing so he must be mindful of

the fact that the statement was not made under oath, that

the statement of the deceased person has not been tested

in cross examination and that the person who, made the

dying declaration is not a witness at the trial.

- An accused can be convicted for murder based mainly

and solely on a dying declaration made by a deceased, -

without corroborating under certain circumstances. It

would not be repugnant or obnoxious to the law to convict

an accused based solely on a dying declaration.

24. It is also pertinent to take into consideration the testimony that

the appellant was seen with an axe in his possession in the hut

occupied by the deceased, just prior to the confession made by the

appellant to PW-02. Further, the deceased-male and the

deceased-female were found in the hut they were living in with

injuries soon after the appellant made such confession to PW-02.

Such a scenario also re-inforce the contents of the verbal

12

statements of the deceased-female to be true and accurate. Also,

the credibility of PW-03, PW-11 and PW-15 has not been called in

question. Hence, there is no hindrance to relying on the testimony

of those witnesses regarding the dying declarations made to PW-

03 and PW-15 or perceived by PW-11.

Additionally, even though the Learned High Court Judge has

mistakenly referred to the testimony of PW-02 to be that of PW-

03 and also concluded that the testimony of PW-01 who had been

made adverse by the prosecution, corroborates the prosecutions

case, such misdirection (error) in my view has not occasioned in a

failure of justice.

25. The prosecution accordingly has led strong and incriminating

evidence which caused the appellant to appear guilty of the

offences stated in the charges in the indictment. In other words a

prima facie case has been made out by the prosecution, therefore,

the appellant is required in law to offer an explanation of the

incriminating evidence established against him.

26. In Sumanasena vs. Attorney General [1993] 3 SLR page 137

at page 142, Jayasuriya, J, has stated,

When the prosecution establishes a strong and

incriminating cogent evidence against the accused, the

accused in those circumstances was required in law to

offer an explanation of the highly incriminating

circumstances established against him.

13

His Lordship has also stated,

the learned trial Judge was entitled to draw certain

inferences which he deemed proper from the failure of the

accused to give evidence in explanation of such

circumstances.

27. E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy in his book, The Law of Evidence,

Volume 1 at page 21, has referred to R. vs. Lord Cochrane and

Others [1814] Gurneys Report, where Lord Ellenborough has

stated,

No person accused of a crime is bound to offer any

explanation of his conduct or of circumstances of suspicion

which is attached to him; but nevertheless if he refuses to

do so, where a strong prima facie case has been made out,

and when it is in his own power to offer evidence if such

exist, in explanation of such suspicious appearances which

would show him to be fallacious and explicable consistently

with his innocence, it is reasonable and justifiable

conclusion that he refrains from doing so only from the

conviction that the evidence so suppressed or adduced

would operate adversely to his interest.

28. The appellant has proceeded to give the following dock statement,

, which in my mind does not

create a doubt in the prosecutions case.

14

29. Though the matters referred to are as such, I now draw my

attention to the mental health report of the appellant dated

29.10.2017. Some of the contents in the mental health report is

as follows,

The reconstruction of the mental state at the time of the alleged

offence revealed the followings;

The accused was mentally ill at the time of the offense.

He had features of schizophrenia at the time of the

alleged offence, according to the mother.

The accused had been having distortions of thought in the form

of delusions, in which he believed that there is another person

who has the same identity as him, as a result of his psychiatric

illness.

36. Therefore he would have been of unsound mind at the time

of the alleged offence.

Fitness to plead and stand trial

37.At present, he is able to

i. Understand the difference between pleading guilty and not

guilty.

ii. Instruct counsel

iii. Follow court proceedings

38. Therefore in my opinion, he is fit to plead and stand trial.

Summary

39. The accused is suffering from a major mental illness

diagnosed as Schizophrenia.

40. In my opinion he was of unsound mind at the time of the

alleged incident.

41.The accused is fit to plead and stand trial.

15

42.He needs to continue treatment as an out-patient for his

mental illness at psychiatry clinic, District General Hospital

Matale.

30. The summary of such report being as reproduced above, it is

clear that the appellant had been of unsound mind/ mentally ill

at the time of the alleged incident, i.e. when he inflicted injuries

on the deceased-male and the deceased-female. The appellant

being of unsound mind would have been incapable of knowing the

nature of his actions or that he was doing something wrong or

contrary to law.

31. Accordingly, set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed

on the appellant by the Learned High Court Judge of

Anuradhapura and acquit him due to the reasons set out above.

32. Taking into consideration the matters discussed in the previous

paragraphs, I now draw my attention to the provisions in Section

380 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No.15 of 1979.

Section 380 provides,

Whenever any person is acquitted upon the ground

that at the time at which he is alleged to have committed

an offence he was by reason of unsoundness of mind

incapable of knowing the nature of the act alleged as

constituting the offence or that it was wrong or contrary

to law, the verdict shall state specifically whether he

committed the act or not.

16

33. On that account I also conclude that the prosecution through the

testimony of the witnesses led on its behalf at the trial has

established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant did

commit the acts of inflicting the injuries which were necessarily

fatal and sufficient in the ordinary course of nature on the two

deceased even though I have proceeded to acquit the appellant in

respect of both charges in the indictment in consideration of the

provisions set out in Section 380 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Code Act. Further, acting in terms of Section 381 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, I direct the Learned High

Court Judge of Anuradhapura to order the prison authorities to

keep the appellant in detention until further directions by the

Minister of Justice.

34. I also direct the Learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura to

report this matter to the Minister of Justice in terms of Section

381 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act together with this

judgment, and the medical records available in relation to the

appellant to enable him to make a suitable decision as regards to

the confinement of the appellant.

35. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this

judgment to the High Court of Anuradhapura for compliance.
