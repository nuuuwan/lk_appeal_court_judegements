JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted along with three other accused by

the Attorney General for committing the offences as mentioned below.

1. On or about the 08th of June 2001, at Mattakkuliya, by causing death

of Wickramasinghe Arachchige Sumith alias Sunith committed an

offence punishable under Section 296 read with Section 32 of the

Penal Code.

2. In the course of the same transaction, committed an offence of Robbery

of a three-wheeler from the possession of Ponniah Mahendiran an

offence punishable under Section 380 read with Section 32 of the

Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Colombo as the

Appellant and other accused who had been numbered as 1st ,2nd and 4th

accused opted for a non-jury trial. The indictment was amended after the

commencement of the trial as the 1st and 2nd accused had passed away

during the pendency of the trial. The case against the Appellant who was

CA/HCC/238/2020

named as 3rd accused and the 4th accused continued, and the prosecution

had led 16 witnesses and marking productions closed the case.

The Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that evidence presented by

the prosecution warranted a case to answer, called for the defence and

explained the rights of the Appellant and the 4th accused.

The Appellant and the 4th Accused remained silent and did not offer any

defence evidence.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellant on the 1st count only and sentenced

him to death on 30/07/2020. The 4th accused was acquitted from all the

charges.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

had preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

PW2, Vijay Kumara, the three-wheeler driver is the only eyewitness to the

incident in which the deceased was allegedly killed by the Appellant and

others named in the indictment. On the day of the incident, 08.06.2001, the

deceased had gone to the Modera Temple at about 5.00 pm and returned to

the three-wheeler in 15 minutes. On his was way, the deceased had given lift

to his brothers daughters and dropped them at Pokkunuwatte and

proceeded to his home situated at Samithpura, Mattakuliya. As there was a

traffic congestion near the Mattakkuliya bus stand, the witness (PW2) had

slowed down the three-wheeler. Suddenly, two persons got into the rear part

of the three-wheeler and had begun to stab the deceased using sharp knives.

CA/HCC/238/2020

At that time, PW2 identified the Appellant as one of the assailants as he too

resides at Samithpura. But he could not identify the other person. At that

time, PW2 could not identify the other person. When he tried to prevent the

stabbing, the Appellant had pointed the knife at him. Due to fear, he had

run from the three-wheeler and observed the continuation of the incident

from a distance of 10 feet. The Appellant and the other dragged the deceased

out of the three-wheeler and stabbed further.

A few minutes later, he took the three-wheeler from the scene of crime and

rushed to Samithpura and conveyed the incident to PW1, Mallika, who is the

wife of the deceased. Thereafter, the deceased was taken to hospital by PW1.

In the evening, he had taken PW1 to the Modera Police Station. According to

PW1, half an hour from the occurrence of the incident, she was informed

about the incident, and she rushed to the place of incident but found the

deceased with bleeding injuries in a culvert. PW1 fainted when she saw her

husband and she was brought home and was hospitalized as she was six

months pregnant at that time. The day before the incident, the deceased had

gone to attend a case in the High Court of Colombo-05 and while he was

returning home, a group of four persons had surrounded him and told the

deceased to breath slowly. No complaint was lodged to police regarding this

incident. As she is not an eye witness to the incident, she could not identify

the Appellant during the trial.

According to PW5, Ponniah Mahendiran, while he was going in his three-

wheeler, close to the bus stand of Mattakkuliya, four persons with blood-

stained clothes and knives appeared in front of his three-wheeler and due to

fear he had given the three-wheeler to them. On the following day, he had

received the same from the Modera Police.

As PW3 and PW4 went back to their statements to police at the trial, both

had been treated as adverse witness.

PW9, JMO Kumudu Kumari who held the postmortem examination stated

that she had noted 35 injuries on the deceaseds body and the cause of death

CA/HCC/238/2020

is due to haemorrhage and shock following multiple stab injuries on the

chest and abdomen penetrating lungs, liver and severing the inferno vane

Cora.

The Learned High Court Judge had concluded that the evidence given by

PW2 is convincing and acted upon the said evidence to convict the Appellant

for the charge of murder. The Appellant was acquitted from the 2nd charge

and the 4th accused was acquitted from the case.

In his solitary ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the evidence of

sole eyewitness PW2 fails the test of credibility, probability and does not

inspire the confidence of the Court.

The Counsel appearing for the Appellant mainly argued that the evidence of

sole eyewitness does not inspire the confidence of the Court as it fails the

test of credibility and probability. Hence, it is very important to consider the

evidence given by PW2 who had been the sole eyewitness to this case.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had concluded that the

evidence of PW2 is convincing and proved the murder charge beyond

reasonable doubt.

Eyewitness testimony is one of the most important kinds of criminal

evidence. In criminal cases, the judges regularly face the difficult but crucial

task of evaluating eyewitnesss testimony. This sometimes means checking

whether the witnesss story fits with other established facts of the case.

However, the veracity of such a story cannot always be verified or falsified

directly. In such cases judges will have to look at whether the statement

comes from a reliable source.

Further, an eyewitnesss testimony is probably the most persuasive form of

evidence presented in court, but in many cases, its accuracy is dubious.

There is also evidence that mistaken eyewitness evidence can lead to

wrongful conviction sending people to prison for years or decades, even to

death row, for crimes they did not commit.

CA/HCC/238/2020

In considering the evidence of an eye witness, the Court should look at the

demeanour of the witness, the inherent probability of the account, any

internal inconsistencies in the account, whether the account is consistent

with previous statements by the witness, whether the witness has any bias

against the accused or any family or group to which the accused belongs,

whether the evidence at the crime scene supports the account, and whether

the witnesss testimony is supported by the testimony of other witnesses.

These factors are very important as the burden of proof is on the prosecution

in all criminal cases.

In The Queen v. K.A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the

evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden

is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to

give evidence and explain the circumstances.

PW2 is a three-wheeler drive who also lives in Samithpura where the

deceased and the Appellant live. The Appellant was a well-known person to

PW2. When the deceased was returning from the temple, the Appellant and

another waylaid and had attacked the deceased with sharp knives by forcibly

entering his three-wheeler. This witness identified the Appellant positively

but failed to identify the other person.

Although the Learned Counsel for the Appellant highlighted some portions

of PW2 and submitted to court that highlighted portions are contradictory to

the evidence given in evidence in compared to his statement to the police.

But the Counsel who appeared in trial court failed to mark those portions as

contradictions. The Learned High Court Judge in judgment had very

correctly penned down that he has no reason to disbelieve the evidence given

by PW2 in the trial. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-produced

below:

The credibility of the witness does not stand impeached merely by proving

contradictions on record. It is required for the defence side to establish that

prosecution witnesses may deliberately depose change or improve their

original statement to cause prejudice to the accused. Similarly, minor

omission or discrepancy in evidence is not enough to hold the accused not

guilty. Thus, by striking out balance and by evaluating evidence in proper

perspective justice can be done. The following cases are very important in

this regard.

1. State Rep. by Inspector of Police v. Saravanan AIR 2009 SC 152

2. Acharaparambath Pradeepan & Anr. v. State of Kerala 2006 13 SCC

643

3. Kehar Singh &amp; Ors v. State (Delhi Admn.) [3] AIR 1988 SC 1883

As the evidence given by the sole eyewitness does not create a doubt or

ambiguity over the prosecution version, the ground raised by the Appellant

does not sufficient to create a reasonable doubt in favour of the Appellant.

Hence, I conclude that the appeal ground raised by the Appellant has no

merit.

CA/HCC/238/2020

As discussed under the appeal ground advanced by the Appellant, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence against the

Appellant. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analyzed all the

evidence presented by both parties and had concluded that the Appellant is

guilty to the murder charge.

As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the

charge levelled against him in the indictment, I affirm the conviction and

dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
