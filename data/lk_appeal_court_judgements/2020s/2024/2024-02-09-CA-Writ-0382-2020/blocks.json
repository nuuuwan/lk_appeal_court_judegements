Consequently, the 6th and 7th Respondents decided to sell and transfer the concerned land. Despite their efforts, they were unable to find a buyer for the property. Subsequently, the 6th Respondent reached out to the Petitioner, who is not only a neighbour but also a known broker to the 7th Respondent. As per the 7th Respondent, the Petitioner initially committed to providing Rs. 500,000/- but later, upon communicating with the 6th Respondent, raised the amount to Rs. 1,250,000/. Nevertheless, the 7th Respondent states the Petitioner only paid Rs. 500,000/- out of the agreed Rs. 1,250,000/-, and for the remaining Rs. 750,000/-, executed Mortgage Bond No. 221 on 15th September, 2006.",
