Decided on:26.02.2024.

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The 3rd to 21st Respondents have been serving as employees in the Petitioner

Company. The Petitioner Company had terminated the services of the said

Respondents on 05-05-2019. Being aggrieved by the said termination, the said

Respondents lodged complaints with the 1st Respondent, the Commissioner of

Labour. The 1st Respondent, on 01-12-2009, held that the said Respondents

services have been unlawfully terminated in terms of the provisions of the

Termination of Employees (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 (as amended)

and ordered that such Respondents be reinstated with back wages.

Being aggrieved by the said Order, the Petitioner invoked the Writ jurisdiction

of the Court of Appeal in case bearing No. CA. Writ-167/2010. The Court of

Appeal on 12-12-2018, quashed the decision of the 1st Respondent to reinstate

the 3rd to 21st Respondents. However, the Court of Appeal upheld the findings

ofthe1stRespondentthattheterminationof the services of the said

Page 4 of 7

Respondents was contrary to the provisions of the Termination of Employees

(Special Provisions) Act. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal directed the 1st

Respondent to hear the parties and make a suitable decision within four

months of the Judgment as to the compensation that should be paid to the

said Respondents in terms of the provisions of the said Act. The Judgment of

the Court of Appeal, in this regard, is reproduced as follows;

In these circumstances, this Court, while upholding the decision of the 1st

Respondent contained in P3, that the termination of services of the 4th to

22nd Respondents is contrary to the provisions of the Termination of

Employees (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 (as amended), proceeds

to issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing only that part of P3, by which the 1st

Respondent ordered that the 4th to 22ndRespondents be reinstated in

service with back wages. This Court directs the 1st Respondent to hear the

parties and make a suitable decision within four months of this judgment,

on the compensation that should be paid to the 4th to 22nd Respondents

under and in terms of section 6 of the Termination of Employees (Special

Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 (as amended).

Accordingly, after inquiry, the 1st Respondent made the impugned Order dated

29-07-2019, directing the Petitioner to pay compensation to the 3rd to 21st

Respondents as contained in P3. The 1st Respondent has come to a finding that

the termination of employment of the said Respondents has occurred on the

date of the judgement of the Court of Appeal in case bearing No. CA.

Writ-167/2010, namely 12-12-2018. Being aggrieved by the said decision, in

the instant Application, the Petitioner has invoked the Writ jurisdiction of this

Court seeking, inter-alia,a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st

Respondent (P3) on the basis, inter-alia, that the date of termination of

employment of the said Respondents should be 05-05-2009.

Page 5 of 7

The contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner is that the

decision of the 1st Respondent that the date of termination was the date of the

judgment of the Court of Appeal in case bearing No. CA. Writ-167/2010, is

ultra-vires, arbitrary, illegal and capricious and whereas the date of termination

should be on 05-05-2009.

The central issue which has to be determined by this Court is whether the

terminationofemploymentofthesaidRespondentsis05-05-2009or

12-12-2018.

In this regard, I refer to the observation made by the Court of Appeal in Kapila

Budhapriya Weerasingha and others Vs. V.B.R.K. Weerasingha and others1

When termination is unjustified, the contract of service must be treated as

unbroken and the Petitioners must be deemed to have been in service

without any break. The Court of Appeal confirmed the fact of unjustified

termination in 2011 and it follows that the Petitioners would have

continued in service till 2011 unless some of them retired prior to 2011.

In light of the above decision, it is abundantly clear that the contract of service

must be treated as unbroken, the Respondents must be deemed to have been

in service without any break when the Court decides that the termination of

employment is unlawful. Thus, in this Application, despite the fact that the

date of termination was on 05-05-2019, as the Court of Appeal in case bearing

No.CA.Writ-167/2010hasdecidedon12-12-2018thatthe purported

termination is unlawful, undisputedly, it isestablished that the 3rd to 21st

Respondents have been in unbroken service till 12-12-2018. As such, I hold

that the finding of the 1st Respondent that the date of termination of services of

1 CA-Writ Application No. 192/2013. CA Minute of 23-05-2019.

Page 6 of 7

the 3rd to 21st Respondents should be the date of the judgement of the Court of

Appeal, namely 12-12-2018 is veracious and justifiable.

The Petitioner did not adduce any evidence in proof of salaries of the said

Respondents. In this scenario, the 1st Respondent, in terms of the provisions of

the National Minimum Wages of Workers Act No. 3 of 2016, has taken the base

salary of the employees as Rs. 10,000/- per month in calculation of the

compensation. Under section 3 (1) of the said Act, the minimum monthly wage

for all workers in any industry of service shall be Rs. 10,000/-. Moreover, the

1st Respondent has adhered to the relevant compensation formula set out in

Extra Ordinary Gazette No. 1384/7 dated 15-03-2005.

It is to be noted that although the learned Counsel for the Petitioner took up

the position that it is not correct to pay compensation to the employees who

have retired before 12-12-2018, as the Petitioner failed to submit the names of

such employees to the 1st Respondent, the said contention is devoid of merits.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that there is no basis to review the decision of

the 1st Respondent marked as P3. Thus, the Application is dismissed with costs

fixed at Rs. 75,000/- payable by the Petitioner to the 3rd to 21st Respondents.

Application dismissed with costs.
