JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Appellant was indicted by the Attorney General at the High

Court of Kalutara as follows:

1. On or before 23/06/2008 for kidnapping Angampodi Yuvana Yvonne

de Silva, an under-aged girl from the legal custody of Walimuni

Shiroma Abeysekera and thereby committing an offence punishable

under Section 357 of the Penal Code.

2. In the course of the same transaction, committing grave sexual abuse

by use of some part of the body of aforesaid Angampodi Yuvana Yvonne

de Silva by placing his penis on her chest and ejaculating semen an

offence punishable under Section 365B (2) (b) of the Penal Code as

amended Act No.22 of 0995.

The prosecution had called 31 witnesses in support of the case. The

Appellant had made a dock statement when the defence was called by the

Learned High Court Judge.

After the trial, the Appellant was convicted as charged and was sentenced to

07 years of rigorous imprisonment for the 1st Count and 12 years rigorous

imprisonment for the 2nd Cout with a fine of Rs.20000/-, in default of which

01-year rigorous imprisonment was imposed. In addition, Rs.100,000.00/-

CA/HCC 184/2017

3 | P a g e

was imposed as compensation payable to the victim with a default sentence

of 02 years rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Appellant was on bail pending appeal and was present in Court during

all dates of the argument.

On behalf of the Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. Did the Learned High Court Judge fail to consider that the prosecution

had failed to prove the ingredients of the charges beyond reasonable

doubt.

2. Did the Learned High Court Judge fail to consider that the evidence of

the victim was inconsistent and contradictory therefore, it is unsafe to

act upon such evidence.

3. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the fact that the video

recording of the victim was not corroborated in material particulars by

evidence from an independent source as required by Section 163A (5)

of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No. 32 of 1999.

4. The Learned Trial Judge erred in law by concluding upon considering

the evidence -in-chief of the victim, that it is proved beyond reasonable

doubt that the Accused committed a sexual act.

5. Did the Learned High Court Judge erred in law by concluding that the

evidence given by the victim at the video conference proved that the

Accused committed a sexual act before analysing of the case.

6. The Learned High Court Judge erred by concluding that the evidence

of the probation officer had corroborated the evidence of the victim.

CA/HCC 184/2017

The Facts of this case albeit briefly are as follows.

In this case, the prosecution had led the video evidence of a preliminary

interview of the prosecutrix conducted and video recorded by the Child

Protection Authority at the time of the investigation was played before the

Learned Trial Judge in terms of Section 163 (A) of the Evidence (Special

Provisions) Act No 32 of 1999. Prior to leading video evidence of the

prosecution, the prosecution had led evidence of official witnesses who had

taken part in the process of recording of video evidence to establish that the

recording had been done after following due process.

In the video evidence, the prosecutrix had said that she had been receiving

education at the Holy Family Convent, Kalutara in grade 9 when she

encountered the incident pertaining to this case. She has a sibling and she

was living with her mother and her aunt at Nagashandiya. While she was

studying at the Holy Family Convent, a love letter written to her boyfriend

was caught by her class teacher and she was taken to the school principal,

PW3 for an inquiry. When she was interrogated by PW3, after corporeal

punishment, she had revealed an incident which had been allegedly

committed by the Appellant.

The Appellant is well known to the victims family as his daughters were also

studying in the same school. The Appellant used to take her and her brother

to school with his children. The mother of the victim, PW2 had no objection

to this help extended by the Appellant. It has been alleged that on one day

the Appellant had taken her to school with her brother and after dropping

her brother, had taken the victim near a mosque, and had unbuttoned her

school uniform. When she said that she wants go home, the Appellant

dropped her to the school and went away.

On the day of the incident, the Appellant had only taken the victim in his

jeep and stopped near the Basket Hall and removed her uniform tuck

buttons, and had kept his penis on her breast and ejaculated. She had

CA/HCC 184/2017

5 | P a g e

further said, that her boyfriend also did the same to her prior to this incident,

which she had told to the Appellant expecting redress.

The prosecution has placed the video evidence as evidence-in-chief of the

prosecutrix and the defence was allowed to cross-examine the witness. In

the cross examination, the prosecutrix had claimed that no such incident

happened to her from the Appellant and she implicated the Appellant due to

instigation of PW3.

As all grounds of appeal are interconnected, all grounds will be considered

together hereinafter. The Learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the

Appellant contended that the Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that

the video recording of the statement of the complainant has not been

corroborated in material particulars by evidence from an independent source

as required by Section 163A (5) of the Evidence ordinance.

Section 163 A (5) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act No.32 of 1999

states:

(5) Where the child witness, in the course of his direct oral testimony

before court, contradicts, either expressly or by necessary implication,

any statement previously made by him and disclosed by the video

recording, it shall be lawful for the presiding judge, if he considers it

safe and just in all the circumstances of the case, to act upon such

previous statement as disclosed by video recording, if such previous

statement is corroborated in material particulars by evidence from an

independent source.

The Learned Presidents Counsel argued, highlighting the above-mentioned

section, that the prosecution had failed to adduce corroborative evidence as

required by law as the prosecutrix had gone back on her statement, which

had been recorded on the video. Hence the learned Presidents Counsel

strenuously argued that the prosecution had not proven the case against the

Appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC 184/2017

The victim in her evidence denies that it was the Appellant that committed

the alleged sexual acts and that it was in fact her boyfriend Romesh who

committed the alleged acts. Further, the victim had categorically stated that

the Appellant had not committed any sexual act on her, but due to the

insistence of PW3 she had implicated the Appellant to this case. The relevant

portions of the evidence are re-produced below:

Corroborating evidence is the proof which strengthens or confirms the

evidence which already exists. Such independent evidence backs up the

testimony of a witness.

In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hester [1972] 3 A.E.R 1056 the

House of Lords held that:

The essence of corroboration evidence is that one creditworthy witness

conforms what another creditworthy witness had said. Any risk of the

conviction of an innocent person is lessened if conviction is based upon

the testimony of more than one acceptable witness The purpose of

corroboration is not to give validity or credence to evidence which is

deficient or suspect or incredible but only to confirm and support that

which as evidence is sufficient and satisfactory and credible; and

corroborative evidence with only fill its role if it in itself is completely

credible evidence.

In Fernando v. The Republic [1978] 79 (II) NLR 313 Vythialingam, J. held

that:

In our law of evidence corroboration is a term which has a special

significance. In the conventional sense as used in our courts it means

other independent evidence which confirms or supports or strengthens

the evidence which is required to be corroborated. In the case of certain

CA/HCC 184/2017

11 | P a g e

categories of witnesses, statues or judges, as a matter of prudence and

caution require that their evidence should be corroborated before it is

accepted and acted upon

The term, however, may also be used in a more popular sense to denote

evidence which renders other evidence more probable. For example, it is

in this latter sense that the term is used in Section 157 of the Evidence

Ordinance which makes admissible any former statement by a witness

relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place or

before any authority competent to investigate the fact, in order to

corroborate him.

In Ariyadasa v. Queen 70 NLR 3 the court held that:

The corroboration that Section 157 contemplates is not corroboration in

the conventional sense in which the term is used in courts of law but in

a sense of consistency in the conduct of a witness tending his testimony

more acceptable.

The Learned Presidents Counsel submitted to this Court that the Learned

High Court Judge had wrongly concluded that the prosecution had

corroborated the evidence of PW1 through the evidence given by PW3 and

PW5. The relevant portions of the judgment are re-produced below:

Although the Learned High Court Judge had concluded that the evidence

given by PW5 had corroborated the evidence given by the victim, but it failed

to support the 2nd charge in the indictment. PW5 only spoke about oral sex

and sexual abuse without distinguishing the sexual act committed on the

victim by the Appellant. But in the Judgment Learned High Court Judge

had come to the conclusion that the evidence given by PW5 had corroborated

video recording evidence of the victim. The relevant portion is re-produced

The Learned Presidents Counsel submitting several judgments argued that

the considering the above-mentioned witnesses as corroborative witnesses

by the Learned High Court Judge has caused great injustice to the Appellant.

He argued that the leading evidence of PW3 and PW5 in this case only shows

the consistency of the prosecutrixs evidence. Even though evidence of PW5

shows consistency of the victims evidence, it fails to prove the 2nd charge.

In Sana v. Republic of Sri Lanka [2009] 1 SLR 48 the court held that:

(1) The corroborative facts and evidence must proceed from someone

other than the witness to be corroborated. This means that his previous

statements, even when admissible cannot be used to corroborate him,

such as proof of a complaint in a sexual case or a previous act of

identification is not corroborative of the evidence of die witness, even

though by showing consistency, it can to some extent strengthen his

credibility.

Where an accused is charged with rape corroboration of the story of the

prosecutrix must come from some independent quarter and not from the

prosecutrix herself. A complaint made by the prosecutrix to the police in

which she implicated the accused cannot be regarded as corroboration

of her evidence.

CA/HCC 184/2017

14 | P a g e

Evidence of a victim in a case of sexual assault cannot be corroborated

by a subsequent statement made by her. The Learned Trial judge was

wrong when he concluded that the evidence of the victim had been

corroborated by her short history given to the doctor.

In King v. Atukorale 50 N.L.R. 256 Gratiaen, J. held that:

The corroboration which should be looked for in cases of this kind is

some independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting

or tending to connect him with the crime, and it is settle law that

although the particulars of a complaint made by a prosecutrix shortly

after the alleged offence may be given in evidence against the prisoner

as evidence of the consistency of her conduct with her evidence given

at the trial, such complaint cannot be regarded as corroboration in

the proper sense in which that word is understood in cases of this kind.

In S. Rajaratnam v. The Republic of Sri Lanka 79(1) N.L.R. 73

Thamotheram,J. held that:

(1) That the corroborating required where the charge is one of rape is

some independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting

or tending to connect him with the crime. A statement made by the

prosecutrix to her grandmother, after the event cannot constitute the

kind of corroboration required.

Considering the above cited judgments pertaining to Corroboration in this

case, the Learned Deputy Solicitor Generals position that the evidence given

by PW3 and PW5 corroborates the testimony of the prosecutrix cannot be

accepted as the evidence given by PW3 and PW5 is not corroborative

evidence. Although the Learned High Court Judge had correctly observed

CA/HCC 184/2017

15 | P a g e

that the prosecutrix had gone against her video evidence, he had misdirected

himself by holding that her evidence had been corroborated by the evidence

of PW3 and PW5. In fact, their evidence only shows the consistency of the

prosecutrixs evidence which certainly strengthens her credibility.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General in his additional written submission

stated that evidence given by PW14, PW6 and PW13 corroborates the fact

that the victim was going with the Appellant in his vehicle. This position was

not only accepted by the victim, the Appellant also admitted in his evidence.

Hence, this evidence cannot be considered as material corroboration as

required under Section 163 A (5) of the Evidence (Special Provisions) Act

No.32 of 1999.

The Learned High Court Judge had heavily relied on the fact that a lady

named Mangala had influenced PW2, mother of the victim to give evidence

in favour of the Appellant. To corroborate this hearsay evidence, the

prosecution had not called Mangala or PW2 to give evidence during the trial.

As correctly argued by Learned Presidents Counsel who represented the

Appellant, hearsay evidence had creep into the proceeding which

undoubtedly affects the fair trial which had been mandated in the

Constitution.

The right to a fair trial lead to determine whether an accused is innocent or

guilty. This is a universally recognised human right. Fair trials help to

establish the truth and are vital for everyone involved in a case. They are a

cornerstone of democracy, helping to ensure fair and just societies, and

limiting abuse by governments and state authorities.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

CA/HCC 184/2017

16 | P a g e

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had come to the conclusion

that the offence allegedly to have committed under Section 365 (2)(b) of the

Penal Code also falls under Section 363(A) (5) of the Penal Code. This is clear

misdirection as the 2nd charge levelled against the Appellant is contemplated

for committing grave sexual abuse on the victim while Section 363 of the

Penal Code refers to the offence of rape.

The grounds of appeal considered above have merits that certainly disturb

the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge. Among them, the

prosecution has failed to adduce corroborative evidence in material

particulars by evidence from an independent source which is, of course, a

statutory requirement under Section 163 A (5) of the Evidence (Special

Provisions) Act No.32 of 1999. Further, Learned High Court Judge has

misdirected on issues pertaining to law of evidence which has led to denial

of a fair trial.

Considering all the circumstances discussed above, this Court could only

come to the conclusion that the prosecution has not proven the case beyond

reasonable doubt. Therefore, the Appellant is acquitted from the charges.

The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside.

The Registrar of this court is directed to send this judgment along with the

original case record to the High Court of Kalutara.
