MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner in this Application is seeking orders, inter alia, in the nature of a

Writ of Certiorari to quash the decisions to accept certain degrees as relevant

disciplines, quashing the decisions relating to the appointment of certain

Respondents, and a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to promote

the Petitioner to the post of Director-I or Director-II.

This Application pertains to the manner in which the interview and selection

of candidates for the positions of Director I and Director II were conducted by

the44thRespondent,namely,theSriLankaInstituteofAdvanced

Technological Education ('SLIATE').

It is submitted that applications were sought from internal staff members to

fill two vacancies in Director I and four vacancies in Director II at SLIATE. The

official advertisement, marked 'P19,' was published on the SLIATE website on

10.07.2019. The Petitioner applied for both positions and received a letter

dated 07.08.2019 (marked 'P25'), inviting his participation in the interview

process. Following this invitation, the Petitioner attended the relevant

interviews on 20.08.2019, as indicated by documents 'P20' and 'P21'.

It is further submitted by the Petitioner that fifteen (15) internal staff members

holdingMaster'sdegreesinfivedistinctdisciplines,includingIT,

Administration, Agriculture, Commerce, and Economics, participated in the

aforementioned interviews. The selection and recruitment of such candidates

were to be carried out in accordance with the Scheme of Recruitment

(SOR-2008).

The said Scheme of Recruitment (SOR-2008), as evidenced in P27, is

reproducedasfollows.Section7.2.1.oftheSchemeofRecruitment

Page 4 of 8

(SOR-2008), Qualification and Experience of internal staff members to apply

for the post of Director-I of ATI are as follows:

1)Master Degree in relevant disciplines with 05 years' experience asSenior Lecturer

And

2)An excellent performance record based on the performance appraisal System.

OR

1) Master Degree in relevant disciplines with 2years experience as Director-2

And

2) An excellent performance record based on the performance evaluationsystem.

Further, as per Section 7.1.1. of the Scheme of Recruitment (SOR- 2008),

Qualification and Experience of internal staff members to apply for the post of

Director-ll of ATI are follows,

1) Master Degree in relevant disciplines with 03 years' experience asSenior Lecturer

And

2) An excellent performance record based on the performance appraisal system.

The central contention put forth by the Petitioner revolves around the alleged

incorrect application of the Scheme of Recruitment (SOR). According to the

Petitioner, the SOR explicitly mandates that only degrees in "relevant

disciplines" should be taken into account during the recruitment process. The

Petitioner asserts that individuals lacking degrees aligned with these specified

"relevant disciplines" have been recruited, thus deviating from the prescribed

criteria outlined in the SOR.The fact that the term "Relevant disciplines"

Page 5 of 8

means the field which is relevant to the subject area of the post to be recruited

has been confirmed by a letter dated 20.08.2019, marked P28, where the

Department of Management Services of the Ministry of Finance has informed

the Petitioner's colleague of such.

Fifteen internal staff members with Master degrees in five (05) different

disciplines such as IT, Administration, Agriculture, Commerce and Economics

took part in the aforesaid interview on 20.08.2019. However, only five (05)

applicants, including the Petitioner, hold a master's degree in administration.

The Scheme of Recruitment, outlining the necessary qualifications and

experience, specifies that applicants must hold a "Master Degree in relevant

disciplines." However, the term 'relevant discipline' remains undefined. It is

crucial to highlight that not all degrees are considered admissible; they are

contingent upon meeting the qualification criteria of being within the 'relevant

discipline.' In light of this, the court deems it necessary to draw attention to

otherprovisionswithintheSchemeofRecruitmenttofacilitatethe

identification and interpretation of the phrase in question. The provided broad

definition of the nature of functions assigned to the category reads as follows:

"Functions in the nature of policy formulation, direction, management, anddecision-making in such fields that form part of the functions assigned to theChief Executive Officer (Director General) are assigned to the holders of postsin this category"

It also provides the following as the Job Summary:

"Ensure the smooth functioning of Academic and management functions ofATI"

Furthermore, as per Section 13(2) of SLIATE Act No. 29 of 1995, every

appointment of the officers and servants of the Institute shall be made by the

Council in accordance with the scheme of recruitment and procedures for

Page 6 of 8

appointment prescribed by regulations. In terms of the Scheme of Recruitment

(SOR-2008) marked P27, the Interview panel has no authority to change the

terms or elements of SOR approved by the DMS. The interview panel has to

comply with the Scheme of Recruitment (SOR-2008) marked P27 whenever

conducting interviews for the Posts stipulated in the same.

The outlined scope of responsibilities makes it abundantly clear that the

incumbent in the mentioned position must possess qualifications specifically

related to administration and management. In the absence of any explicit

guidance regarding the term 'relevant discipline' within the Scheme of

Recruitment, the inclination is to interpret it as synonymous with the subject

area directly germane to the responsibilities inherent in the post under

consideration. This interpretation aligns with the evident emphasis on

qualifications pertaining to administration and management as articulated in

the delineated responsibilities for the position. The apparent injustice lies in

the allowance of candidates with unrelated degrees to be considered viable,

while candidates possessing relevant qualifications are unfairly sidelined.

In the context of the specified recruitment process, it is clear that candidates

lacking a degree from the relevant discipline will not be considered competent

or eligible. This means that the Scheme of Recruitment unequivocally requires

individuals to hold qualifications specifically aligned with the pertinent

subject area associated with the post under consideration. The emphasis on

the"relevantdiscipline"underscorestheimportanceofpossessing

qualifications directly related to the responsibilities and requirements of the

position. The intention is to ensure that candidates selected for the recruitment

process have educational backgrounds that align closely with the nature of the

role, promoting competence and suitability for the specified position

Page 7 of 8

In consideration of the aforementioned circumstances, I hereby grant and

issue an order in the nature of Writs of Certiorari, as prayed in prayers (g), (h),

(i), and (i), thereby quashing the appointment of the 10th, 11th, 8th, and 9th

Respondents who do not possess the requisite degree within the relevant

discipline. Additionally, I further grant and issue an order in the nature of a

Writ of Mandamus, as prayed in prayer (k), instructing the Respondents to

promote the Petitioner to the position of Director I or Director II, as they deem

appropriate. This directive is to be executed considering all eligible candidates

from relevant disciplines for the specific recruitment in question.
