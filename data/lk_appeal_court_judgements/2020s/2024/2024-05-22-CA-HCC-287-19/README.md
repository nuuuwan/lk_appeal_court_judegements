WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo on

following two counts:

i. On or about 13th of September 2012, for trafficking 27.02

grams of heroin, an offence punishable under Section 54A (b)

of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

ii. During the course of the same transaction for possessing

27.02 grams of heroin, an offence punishable under Section

54A (d) of the Poisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance.

The prosecution led the evidence of eight witnesses. After the

prosecution case was closed, the learned Trial Judge called for the

defence. Accordingly, the accused-appellant made an unsworn

statement from the dock and one witness was called on behalf of the

appellant. At the conclusion of the trial, the appellant was acquitted of

the first count and convicted of the second count by the Judgment

dated 02.07.2019. The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment.

This appeal has been preferred against the said conviction and

sentence.

Prior to the hearing of this appeal, written submissions were filed on

behalf of both parties. At the hearing, the learned Counsel for the

accused-appellant and the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for

the respondent made oral submissions.

The prosecution witness number one was a soldier attached to the

Surveillance Unit of Sri Lanka Army. On 13.09.2012, together with two

other soldiers he had gone to Grandpass area on usual surveillance

duty. PW-1 had received an information from one of his informants and

as a result, the raid pertaining to this case was carried out.

According to the prosecution, PW-1 met the informant close to the clock

tower at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Mawatha around 6.20 in the evening

and provided him with information that a young man was carrying

heroin and he was near the Mahawatta rail gate. Then they proceeded

by foot in the said direction. The informant who came along with these

Army officers stopped about 25-30 meters before the rail gate and

pointed at a person. Then, PW-1 and other two soldiers approached that

person, searched him and found a parcel from his right trouser pocket

containing a brown colour substance. Thereafter, PW-1 contacted his

senior officer Major Ratnayake (PW-10) and on his instructions, the

appellant was handed over to PW-7 at the Police Narcotics Bureau

around 7.10 pm on the same day. Subsequently, it was found that the

brown colour substance recovered from the possession of the appellant

is heroin.

The learned Counsel for the appellant advanced his arguments on the

following three grounds:

i. The learned Trial Judge failed to consider the inconsistencies

in the prosecution case.

ii. Prosecution has failed to establish the last link of the inward

journey of the production beyond a reasonable doubt.

Page 4 of 11

iii. The learned Trial Judge has rejected the dock statement on a

wrong premise.

The basis of this appeal according to the learned Counsel for the

appellant is that the evidence of the prosecution fails the tests of

probability and credibility. The learned Counsel pointed out that there

is no note whatsoever made by PW-1, the officer who received

information from his private informant. While admitting the fact that

making notes is not essential for a witness to give evidence, the learned

Counsel contended that unlike in other cases, the prosecution must be

closely scrutinized when there are no inward and outward notes.

What the learned Counsel for the appellant was trying to demonstrate

is that giving evidence regarding the raid after four years without notes

is far from possible. The senior DSG replied that PW-1 has explained

that he remembered the facts relating to this raid without notes because

this was his first ever heroin raid.

It is hard to believe if a police officer or an officer of the Narcotics Bureau

states that he remembers the facts of a raid after four years for the

simple reason that they engage continuously in this kind of raids and

it is not possible for a person to remember the details of many raids for

years without any note. However, in the case at hand, this was the first

ever heroin raid conducted by PW-1 (page 71 of the appeal brief). Hence,

his explanation of how he remembered the facts of the raid without

notes is acceptable and believable.

The learned Senior DSG stressed the fact that PW-1 and PW-2 who were

in usual surveillance duty had no reason to introduce heroin to the

appellant because they did not know anything about the appellant, they

had no animosity whatsoever with him and they are not rewarded by

doing this kind of a raid. The learned Senior DSG contended that there

were no contradictions in the prosecution case that go to the root of the

case and the evidence of the prosecution witnesses is probable and

credible.

Page 5 of 11

Now, I proceed to consider the aforesaid grounds of appeal raised by

the learned Counsel for the appellant.

The first ground of appeal -

The learned Trial Judge failed to consider the inconsistencies in the

prosecution case.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant pointed out that according to PW-

1, he met the informant near the Mahawatta clock tower and the same

person went with them and showed the accused-appellant but

according to the evidence of PW-2, he has stated about two informants.

Also, the learned Counsel submitted that PW-1 had not stated that he

met the private informant near the stadium before they met near the

clock tower.

When going through the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 regarding the

aforesaid point, it appears that both witnesses have stated about only

one informant. PW-1 has stated that they met the informant near the

clock tower at Sirimavo Bandaranaike Mawatha, they proceeded by foot

towards the rail gate, the informant stopped about 25-30 meters before

the rail gate and pointed out the appellant. PW-2 had stated that they

met the informant near the stadium and came near the clock tower at

Sirimavo Bandaranaike Mawatha. It is correct that PW-1 had not stated

that they met the informant first near the stadium. However, it is not

an omission that affects the credibility of these witnesses. Apart from

that, both witnesses narrated the same story on this point. It is

apparent from the following portion of PW-2s evidence that he also

stated that the same informant who met them previously showed the

accused-appellant subsequently.

(Page 161 of the appeal brief)

Although some other matters relating to the inconsistencies of the

prosecution case have been mentioned in the written submission

submitted on behalf of the appellant, the learned Counsel for the

appellant made submission only with regard to the aforesaid point at

the hearing. As explained previously, there is no discrepancy between

the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 regarding the said point. PW-1 had

omitted to state in his evidence that he met the informant near the

stadium before they met again near the clock tower. However, the said

omission is not a material omission relating to the main events

regarding the raid and thus no reasonable doubt creates as a result of

the said omission.

In addition, the learned Counsel for the appellant contended that

according to PW-1, when the appellant was taken into custody after the

raid, they contacted PW-10, Major Ratnayake and on his instructions

the appellant was handed over to the Police Narcotics Bureau. However,

the learned Counsel pointed out that according to Major Ratnayake, he

instructed them to handover the appellant to the Narcotics Bureau

before he was arrested. I do not see the said discrepancy as a vital

contradiction which affects the credibility of the witnesses because

Major Ratnayake explained that all those incidents took place within a

short period of time, he knew about the information regarding the

trafficking of heroin and therefore, he instructed his officers to

handover the suspect to the Police Narcotics Bureau.

The second ground of appeal -

Prosecution has failed to establish the last link of the inward journey of

the production beyond a reasonable doubt.

Page 7 of 11

Citing two Judgments of this Court, the learned Counsel for the

appellant contended that the chain of productions, especially, the

inward journey to the Government Analyst Department has to be proved

beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution to satisfy the Court that

there has been no tampering with the production. It is perfectly correct

that in a case of this nature, the prosecution must establish beyond a

reasonable doubt that there was no opportunity to tamper with the

productions.

In the case at hand, what the learned Counsel for the appellant pointed

out was although PW-6, the Police Inspector Rajakaruna stated that he

took the productions from the Magistrate Court of Maligakanda and

handed over the same to the Assistant Government Analyst C.B.

Kumarapeli in the Government Analyst Department but the said

Ms. Kumarapeli was not called in evidence to establish the chain of

production. However, PW-8, Senior Assistant Government Analyst

Vajira Jayasekara has been called as a witness on behalf of the

prosecution and she testified that the Police Inspector Rajakaruna had

handed over the productions to the Government Analyst Department,

and the Assistant Government Analyst who was on duty had accepted

the productions and handed over to her for analysis. The Senior

Assistant Government Analyst stated further that the seals in the

production were intact when she received the productions.

I am of the view that these items of evidence are sufficient to prove the

chain of productions beyond a reasonable doubt because although

Ms. Kumarapeli was not called in evidence, Senior Assistant

Government Analyst Vajira Jayasekara who tested productions has

stated in her evidence that seals were intact when she received

productions for testing. Hence, I regret that I am unable to agree with

the contention that the prosecution has failed to establish the last link

of the inward journey of the production beyond a reasonable doubt.

The third ground of appeal -

The learned Trial Judge has rejected the dock statement on a wrong

premise.

The learned Counsel for the appellant pointed out that on page 08 of

the Judgment, the learned High Court Judge wrongly observed that

although the accused stated in the dock statement that he had been

arrested by a group of persons but he did not possessed heroin, the

position taken up by the appellant when cross-examining the

prosecution witnesses was that the accused-appellant was never

arrested. As correctly contended by the learned Counsel for the

appellant, the appellant has not taken the position in cross-examining

the prosecution witnesses that the accused-appellant has never been

arrested by them. what was suggested to PW-1 and PW-2 was that the

appellant never possessed heroin. However, the prosecution witnesses

have never been suggested on behalf of the appellant, the position taken

up in the dock statement that the appellant was taken to the Narcotics

Bureau and forcibly his finger prints were taken to a parcel that was

introduced.

The Indian Judgment of Sarvan Singh V. State of Punjab (2002 AIR

SC (iii) 3652) pages 3655 and 3656, was cited in the case of Ratnayake

Mudiyanselage Premachandra V. The Hon. Attorney General C.A.

Case No. 79/2011, decided on 04.04.2017 as follows:

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined

to avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination,

it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be

accepted.

In the case at hand, as explained above, it has not been suggested to

the prosecution witnesses the position taken up in the dock statement.

Therefore, in view of the aforesaid decision denial made by the appellant

in his brief dock statement creates no doubt on the prosecution case.

Page 9 of 11

Therefore, the decision of the learned Trial Judge to reject the dock

statement is correct although he stated the aforesaid wrong observation

in his Judgement.

In addition, according to the dock statement of the accused, placing his

finger impression to a parcel is admitted. What the appellant said is

that some people came, pointed out a pistol to him, he was taken to the

Narcotics Bureau, introduced a heroin parcel and took his finger

impression. It is important to consider whether it is possible for Army

officials who were in surveillance duty to apprehend an innocent person

who was on the road and handover him to the Police Narcotics Bureau.

According to the appellants dock statement not only the Army

personals (PW-1, PW-2 and other officers) apprehended him without

any reason but also the officers of the Narcotics Bureau also introduced

heroin and forcibly taken the finger impression from an innocent person

who was brought by the Army officers and handed over to the Narcotics

Bureau. As contended by the Senior DSG, PW-1, PW-2 or any other

officer did not have any animosity with the appellant. They do not get

any reward by conducting this kind of raid. In addition, according to

the appellants story, heroin parcel was introduced and his finger

impression was taken after he was brought to the Narcotics Bureau.

That means when he was caught by the Army officials and was being

taken to the Narcotics Bureau, the appellant did not possess anything.

If it is so no man with common sense can believe that the Army officers

caught and produced a man with nothing to the Police Narcotics

Bureau. Hence, this statement made by the appellant from the dock is

totally improbable. Therefore, it is obvious that no reasonable doubt

creates on the prosecution case because of the improbable statement of

the accused-appellant.

For the reasons stated above, I find no reason to interfere with the

Judgement of the learned High Court Judge on the aforesaid three

grounds of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant. For

Page 10 of 11

the sake of completeness of this Judgment, I wish to consider the legal

position regarding the foundation of all the arguments advanced by the

learned Counsel for the appellant. What the learned Counsel stated is

that there is a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.

What is meant by a reasonable doubt has been discussed in the

following Judicial Authorities. In the case of Veerasamy Sivathasan

V. Hon. Attorney General - SC Appeal 208/2012, decided on 15

December 2021, it was held as follows: As regards the standard of proof

to be satisfied in a criminal case, there is no doubt that the prosecution

must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. However, one must take

a realistic and pragmatic view of what can be reasonably expected of a

prosecution. It is important in my view to bear in mind that a

prosecution cannot be expected to prove its case to a degree of

mathematical accuracy of scientific certainty. The degree of accuracy

and certainty that a prosecution can be reasonably expected to satisfy

is much less. That is quite natural, as prosecutions have to rely

primarily on human testimony, which is subject to the inherent frailties

associated with human observation, memory, recollection, and verbal

articulation through oral testimony.

In Shivaji Sahebrao Bobade & Anr. V. State of Maharashtra

equivalent citations: 1973 AIR 2622, 1974 SCR (1) 489, the Supreme

Court of India has commented that, the cherished principles of the

golden thread of proof beyond reasonable doubt which runs through

the web of our law should not be stretched morbidly to embrace every

hunch and degree of doubt. Only reasonable doubts belong to the

accused. Otherwise, any practical system of justice will break down and

lose credibility with the community.

In Dharm Das Wadhwani V. The State of Uttar Pradesh, 1974 Cri.

LJ (SC) 1249, the Supreme Court of India has observed that, The

rule of benefit of reasonable doubt does not imply a frail willow bending

to every whiff of hesitancy. Judges are made of sterner stuff and must

Page 11 of 11

take a practical view of legitimate inferences flowing from evidence,

circumstantial or direct.

In Wijesekera (Excise Inspector) V. Arnolis, (1940) (17 CLW 138),

Justice Wijeyewardene has held that, it is not every kind of doubt

the benefit of which an accused person is entitled. An accused person

could claim only the benefit of a reasonable doubt. It is always possible

to conjure up a doubt of a very flimsy nature. But an accused person

cannot be acquitted on the ground of such doubt The guilt or

innocence of an accused person must be determined on evidence and

not on some suggestion made in the course of an argument

In view of the decisions of aforesaid judicial authorities, it is apparent

that in the instant action the prosecution has proved its case beyond a

reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, the Judgement of the learned High Court Judge of

Colombo dated 02.07.2019, the conviction and the sentence imposed

on the accused-appellant are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
