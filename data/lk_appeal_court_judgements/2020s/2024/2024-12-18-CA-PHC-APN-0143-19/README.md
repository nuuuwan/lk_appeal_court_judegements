JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Respondent-Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the 1st

Respondent) filed a charge sheet Under Section 23(2) read with Sections

38(a),40,40(a) and 25(2) of the Forest Ordinance against the Accused in

the Magistrate Court of Kandy for illegally transporting timber without a

valid permit on 05.08.2017. As the Accused persons pleaded guilty to

the charge sheet, the Learned Magistrate of Kandy had convicted the

CA PHC 143/2019

4 | P a g e

Accused persons as charged and imposed a fine of Rs.10,000/- each

with a default sentence and fixed for an inquiry whether to confiscate or

not the vehicle bearing No. 251-9353 which had been used for the

transportation of the timber mentioned above.

At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate had decided to

confiscate the aforesaid vehicle by his order dated 26.09.2018. At the

inquiry, the Registered Owner-Petitioner-Appellant (Hereinafter referred

to as the Appellant) and two witnesses gave evidence and marked seven

documents.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Appellant filed a

Revision Application in the Provincial High Court of Kandy to revise the

order of the Learned Magistrate of Kandy. After an inquiry, the Learned

High Court Judge of Kandy by her order dated 26.09.2019 dismissed

the revision application on the basis that the 2nd Accused who

admittedly had the possession and control of the vehicle had pleaded

guilty to the charge.

Now the Appellant filed this appeal to set aside the order of the Learned

High Court Judge of Kandy dated 26.09.2019 and the order of Learned

Magistrate of Kandy dated 26.09.2018.

The Appellant submitted following grounds of appeal:

i. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law in holding that the

owner for the purpose of section 40 of the Forest Conservation

Ordinance as amended was the 2nd Accused;

ii. The Learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate the factual

differences between the judgment in Ceylon Leasing Corporation

Limited v. M. H. Harrison, OIC Kuttigala (SC Appeal 43/2012) and

the facts before the Learned High Court Judge and thereby erred

in fact and in law;

CA PHC 143/2019

5 | P a g e

iii. The Learned High Court Judge erred in fact and in law in holding

that the registered owner had failed to prove that he had taken all

precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission

of the offence;

iv. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the

motor vas was not a vehicle usually used for transporting timber

and thereby has erred in fact an in law;

v. The Learned High Court Judge has wrongly applied the concept

of possession and control of the motor vehicle and thereby has

erred in fact and in law; and,

vi. The Judgement is bad in law and contrary to the evidence place

before the Learned Magistrate of Kandy.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge considering the order of the

Magistrate Court of Kandy decided to dismiss the revision application

on the basis that as the Owner mentioned in the Section 40 of the

Forest Ordinance is the person who had the possession and control of

the vehicle on the agreement marked X9, was the 2nd Accused who had

pleaded guilty to the charged.

In this case a van had been confiscated for transporting timber worth

about Rs.49,319.45 illegally.

The Appellant giving evidence admitted that he was not in the country

when the offence was committed. According to him he had given the

vehicle to a friend called Safrin on rent, by virtue of an agreement later

formalised which was marked as X5. Further the Appellant had no

knowledge to whom the vehicle had been given by Safrin. He only came

to know that the vehicle had been apprehended by police.

Although the Appellant claimed that he is the registered owner of the

vehicle and got it released to him on a bond by the Court, failed to

produce the Certificate of Registration or even a copy of the same

during the inquiry.

CA PHC 143/2019

6 | P a g e

Although Safrin had claimed that he had given the vehicle to 1st

Accused on rent after singing an agreement which was marked as X9,

but in the agreement the 1st Accused had only placed his signature as a

witness not as transferee or hirer. Further,1st Accused in his evidence

admitted that he was unaware as to the owner of the vehicle.

In this case, although the 2nd Accused to whom the vehicle had been

given on rent as per X9 and pleaded guilty to the charge, failed to give

evidence at the inquiry.

Now I am going to consider whether the grounds of appeal raised on

behalf of the Appellant have any merit. As the appeal grounds

mentioned above are interconnected, all appeal grounds will be

considered together hereinafter.

As the law stands today, the Claimant in a vehicle confiscation inquiry

should prove that he or she had have taken all preventive measures on

a balance of probability. Hence, the Learned Magistrate should consider

all the evidence very carefully before coming to a conclusion.

In The Orient Financial Services Corporation Ltd v The Range

Forest Officer, Ampara and Hon. Attorney General [2013] 1 SLR

208 the Court held that:

1. Before an order for forfeiture is made the owner should be given

an opportunity to show cause. If the owner on balance probability

209 satisfies the Court that he had taken precautions to prevent

the commission of the offence or the offence was committed without

his knowledge nor, was he privy to the commission of the offence,

the vehicle has to be released to the owner.

2. When it comes to showing cause as to why the vehicle should

not be confiscated, only the person who was in possession and

control of the vehicle could give evidence to the effect that the

CA PHC 143/2019

7 | P a g e

offence was committed without his knowledge and he had taken

necessary steps to prevent the commission of the offence.

In Mudankotuwa v Attorney General [1996] 2 SLR 77 the court held

that:

As seen from the evidence the vehicle was taken over by the

driver from the Petitioners house in the morning and it was

returned to him in the evening with the collections. Further, clear

instructions had been given by the Petitioner to the driver, not to

transport timber or use the vehicle for any illegal

purposeTherefore, the Magistrate was in error when he came

to the conclusion that the Petitioner had exercise no control or

supervision over the driver regarding the use of the tractor.

Although the Appellant, as the owner of the vehicle had given evidence

and explained to the Court that he had taken all the possible and

necessary precautions to prevent the vehicle being used for illegal

purposes, but the evidence placed by the Appellant clearly establishes

the fact that the Appellant did not know who had in fact been in

possession and control of the vehicle in question when the police

apprehended the vehicle with timber. This clearly shows that the

Appellant had not taken any precaution to prevent the use of the

impugned vehicle for commission of the instant offence.

Further, not calling 2nd Accused to give evidence certainly affect the root

of the case. Thereby the Appellant had failed to adduce cogent evidence

that the offence committed without his knowledge.

Hence, the Learned High Court Judge dismissing the application on the

basis that the Appellant had failed to show that he took all necessary

precautions to prevent a crime being committed is correct in this case.

Therefore, I affirm the order of the High Court Judge Kandy dated

CA PHC 143/2019

8 | P a g e

26.09.2019 and the order of the Learned Magistrate of Kandy dated

26.09.2018. Therefore, this appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgement to the

High Court of Kandy and the Magistrate Court of Kandy for information.
