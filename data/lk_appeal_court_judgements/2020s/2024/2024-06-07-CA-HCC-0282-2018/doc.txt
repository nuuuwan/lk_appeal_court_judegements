After trial, the Appellant was found guilty only on the second count

(Possession) and the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo has imposed life

imprisonment on her on 14/09/2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellant

preferred this appeal.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given her consent to argue this matter in her absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The case for the prosecution does not satisfy the test of probability.

2. The rejection of the defence evidence on wrong premise.

In this case the raid was conducted in the absence of any specific information

received. The raid was headed by PW1 with two police officers from the

Grandpass Police Station. All have been named as witnesses in the

indictment including the Government Analyst. The prosecution had called

PW1, PW2, PW5, PW7 and PW9 and closed their case. The Government

Analyst Report was admitted under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. The prosecution marked production P1-P11.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had made a statement from the

Dock and called a witness (husband) and closed the defence case.

Background of the case.

On 04/11/2015 PW1 IP/Chammika attached to the Grandpass Police

Station had gone for a routine mobile patrolling with two police officers in a

van belonging to the Police Department. The team had left the police station

at about 9.38am. The witness and PW2 were in civil dress while PW3 were

CA/HCC/282/18

clad in a No.02 police uniform. In addition to other items, they had also taken

sealing instruments with them. First, they had gone to Stacepura for the

raid. After parking the van in a petrol shed, they decided to go on a foot patrol

along Stacepura main road. The witness had spotted the Appellant who was

standing near a Buddha statue on the Stacepura Road. PW1 reported that

upon seeing the police officers, the Appellant began walking towards her

house, arousing suspicion. Consequently, the Appellant was stopped for

questioning and searched. At that time, the police PW1 had observed a pink

coloured cellophane bag with something in it in the hand of the Appellant.

The Appellant was trying to hide the same by fisting her right hand and

keeping it behind her. PW1 took the parcel into his custody and inspected

the same. The parcel contained some brown coloured substance. As it

reacted for Heroin (Diacetylmorphine) the Appellant was arrested

immediately. The arresting time was 10.30am. The Appellant was taken to

Letchumi Jewellers situated in Kosgas Junction to weigh the substance. The

Appellant was taken to the Jewellers by PW1 and assisted by PW2. The parcel

contained 10 grams of substances. After entering notes, the Appellant and

the productions were handed over to the Grandpass Police Station under PR

No.189/2015. Rs.470/- also recovered from the Appellant at that time.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence, an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

CA/HCC/282/18

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus: [1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are interrelated, the grounds

will be considered together in this case.

Probability plays a crucial role in persuading a judge on specific points, as

the higher the probability of an assumption, the greater the likelihood of

convincing the judge. Probability is highly significant in criminal

investigations, where it is utilized to evaluate the relevance of different types

of evidence. In order to accuse someone "beyond reasonable doubt," it is

essential to have strong evidence, which often involves making certain

assumptions to draw conclusions. The likelihood of these assumptions being

true is specifically referred to as the principle of probability in legal terms.

In this case, only three police officers had conducted the raid. They had set

off from the police station without any specific information. After the arrest,

the Appellant was taken to a jewellery shop named Letchumi Jewellery and

weighed the substances.

The gross quantity said to have recovered from the Appellant is 10 grams.

The arresting time was 10.30am and the police party left the Lecthumi

Jewellers at about 12.16 noon. Considering the circumstances of the case, it

is highly improbable that the police officers took over an hour to weigh this

small amount.

Although PW1 and PW2 were not in police uniform, the Appellant got nervous

after seen them and she had started to walk towards her house. Further,

standing alone near the Buddha statue also arose the suspicion of the

witness on her. Although the prosecution denied that she was arrested at

her house by the police, PW1 admitted that he knew the Appellant earlier.

This clearly confirms the defences version and raises doubt over the

narration of the prosecution witnesses, as it so fanciful.

As per PW1's testimony, the Appellant was wearing a frock with a pocket. As

aptly argued by the Appellant's Learned Counsel, this factual account raises

doubts about why she would become nervous upon seeing two random men,

who were actually the two officers in plain clothes, and then proceed towards

her house while allegedly holding a packet of heroin. This was not properly

evaluated by the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment.

Further, Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the Dock

Statement of the Appellant in its correct perspective. He had disbelieved and

rejected the Dock Statement merely because it was not given under oath and

was not subjected to cross examination. This approach, no doubt had caused

great prejudice to the Appellant. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-

produced below:

Although PW1 said that the raid was a routine exercise, he admitted that he

knew the Appellant previously as Batti and her house location. I too agree

with the Learned Counsel for the Appellant that the Learned High Court

Judge should have considered this portion of evidence when he analysed the

evidence of the defence.

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the

prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

In this case, the Learned High Court Judge had not considered the

probability factors in conjunction with the defences evidence. The rejection

of defences evidence without proper analysis had caused great prejudice to

the Appellant.

CA/HCC/282/18

8 | P a g e

The burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute.

It is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas probandi

incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: "the necessity of proof always

lies with the person who lays charges."

In this case, the raid was conducted without any specific information.

Further, recovery and weighing the production has failed to pass the

probability test in this case. Had the Learned Trial Judge looked into the

evidence presented in its correct perspective, he should have accepted the

evidence adduced by the Appellant.

As the prosecution had failed in its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 14/09/2018 on the Appellant. Therefore, she

is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
