ARGUED ON : 21.05.2024

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Rathnapura

on two counts for,

1. committing an act of rape on his daughter during the period of

01.01.2012 to 31.12.2012, an offence punishable under Section

364(3) of the Penal Code.

2. committing another act of rape other than on the occasion

mentioned in the first count, on his daughter during the

aforementioned period of time, an offence punishable under

Section 364(3) of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted the accused-appellant

for both counts and imposed 17 years of rigorous imprisonment on each

count. A fine of Rs. 25,000/- carrying default sentences of simple

imprisonment of 6 months were also imposed on each count. Additionally,

compensation in a sum of Rs. 200,000/- carrying default sentences of

one year simple imprisonment were imposed on each count. Sentences

were ordered to run concurrently. This appeal is preferred against the said

convictions and sentences.

Written submissions on behalf of both parties were filed prior to the

hearing. At the hearing, the learned Counsel for the appellant and the

Page 3 of 14

learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) for the respondent

made oral submissions.

The prosecution case may be briefly summarized as follows:

The victim, PW-1 who was studying in Grade 09 at the time of the

incident was the daughter of the accused-appellant. In February 2012,

on the day of the first incident, victim had gone to her aunts house with

her family to attend a pirith ceremony and had returned home around

7.30 p.m. with her father, the accused-appellant to collect some cloths.

The accused and the victim were alone at home. According to PW-1, the

accused-appellant had pulled the victim to the bed at that moment and

raped her. She had managed to escape in a while and went back to the

aunts house. The victim had not disclosed the incident to anyone as

the appellant had threatened to kill her and her mother if she did so.

About three months later, the victim had returned home from school

and was changing her cloths around 2.15 p.m. At that moment, the

Accused- appellant had put the victim on the bed and raped her for the

second time.

In 2015, the victim had sent a text message to her boyfriend, Saman

Kumara using her grandfathers mobile phone (although the victim,

PW-1 refers to it as mothers phone, the mother, PW-2 stated that it is

her fathers phone) mentioning that her father harasses her. PW-2, the

mother of the victim had seen the message. On the next day,

12.06.2015, the accused had a quarrel with PW-2, the mother of the

victim and had beaten PW-2. According to PW-1, the accused-appellant

had constant fights with her mother. On this particular day, when the

accused was beating her mother with an iron rod, PW-1 had revealed

her mother about the incidents of rape committed by the father in the

presence of the accused-appellant. The mother had then gone to the

police station to make a complaint and the victim had tried to commit

Page 4 of 14

suicide by consuming poison while her mother was at the police station

making a complaint.

The learned Counsel for the accused-appellant advanced her

arguments on the following grounds of appeal:

1. Inconsistent and erratic versions in the testimony of the

prosecutrix renders her evidence unworthy of credence.

2. Testimony of the prosecutrix is peppered with vital omissions and

material contradictions which consequently taints her credibility

and testimonial trustworthiness.

3. 3 year undue belatedness of the police complaint renders the

conviction wholly unsafe.

4. Reasons adduced by the prosecutrix to justify the said

belatedness are wholly unjustifiable and/or appear to be palpably

false in view of the vital omissions coupled with her subsequent

conduct following the alleged 1st incident.

5. Learned Trial Judges (LTJ) conclusive finding that the evidence

of the prosecutrix is wholly consistent with the history recorded

by the 2 medical officers is factually and legally flawed.

6. Evidence of the prosecutrix does not favour the test of probability

in view of the suspicious subsequent conduct of the prosecutrix

following the alleged 1st incident of rape.

7. Rejection of the dock statement is legally flawed as the LTJ has

shifted the burden of proof to the accused-appellant thereby

reversing the presumption of innocence and occasioning in a

deprivation of a fair trial.

8. Sec. 114(f) of the E.O. operates against the prosecution for its

failure to list and lead the evidence of Saman Kumara who was a

vital witness to the prosecution and who would have provided the

missing link in the prosecution case.

9. Judgment of the Trial Court is legally and factually flawed thereby

rendering the Judgment factually and legally untenable.

Page 5 of 14

Although, nine grounds of appeal have been submitted by the learned

Counsel, some of them are repetitions. Therefore, firstly, I summarize

the grounds of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant

as follows:

i. Belatedness of making a complaint to the police has not been

justified.

ii. Prosecutrixs testimony is not reliable.

iii. Rejection of the dock statement is legally flawed.

iv. Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance operates against the

prosecution for its failure to lead the evidence of Saman

Kumara.

v. The Judgment of the learned High Court Judge is legally and

factually flawed.

The learned SDSG contended that the victim was 13 years old at the

time of the incident. He contended that the appellant, the father of the

victim was in the Army one time and the victim has explained that

because of fear, she did not disclose to anyone that the father had raped

her. He contended further that when the incident occurred in 2011, she

had only two younger sisters and she could not tell about fathers

sexual harassments to them because the two sisters were very small at

that time. After she started a love affair with Saman Kumara in 2015,

she said that she revealed the sexual harassment done by the farther

through an SMS. Therefore, the learned SDSG submitted that the delay

in informing the police has been justified. The learned SDSG contended

further that the doctor who examined the victim has given evidence and

his evidence is consistent with the history given by the victim. Also, she

had been referred to a psychiatrist and the SDSG contended that as an

independent witness, his evidence demonstrates the victims plight due

to the incident. Therefore, he contended that the evidence of the doctor

and psychiatrist corroborates the victims evidence and the learned

Trial Judge has come to the correct conclusion.

Page 6 of 14

Now, I proceed to consider the grounds of appeal.

Belatedness of making a complaint to the police has not been justified.

The first complaint was made by the mother of the victim (PW-2) on 12th

of June 2015. The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that

after three and a half years, the first complaint had been made. The

learned Counsel stated that the reason explained for the long delay was

fear, because of fear a complaint was not made and it is not a justifiable

reason. Therefore, she contended that making a belated complaint casts

a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. The learned SDSG pointed

out the items of evidence relating to the reason why the victim daughter

was so scared to complain agaist the father and contended that those

reasons justify the delay of making a complaint to the police.

Undisputedly, the victim was 13 years old when the incidents relating

to the two charges occurred. Generally, making a prompt complaint to

the police regarding the incident is one of the reasons to believe that

the prosecution story is true. However, the test of promptness should

be applied carefully because delay is not always a reason to disbelieve

a witness. As it was held in Sumanasena V. Attorney General (1999)

3 Sri L.R. 137, just because the witness is a belated witness Court

ought not to reject his testimony on that score alone, Court must

inquire into the reason for the delay and if the reason for the delay is

plausible and justifiable, the Court could act on the evidence of a

belated witness. Accordingly, even when considering an offence

committed against an adult, a delay in making a statement to the police

about the incident alone is not a reason to disbelieve the testimony of

the victim, if an acceptable reason is given for the delay.

Delay in making a complaint about an offence committed against a child

is different. In the case at hand, the victim girl kept silent without

informing anybody about the rape or sexual harassment committed by

her farther for three and a half years. A childs reason for silence has

Page 7 of 14

been explained in The Crown Court Compendium Part I (published

in May 2016 - page 10-22), as follows:

Experience has shown that children may not speak out about something

that has happened to them for a number of reasons. A child may

be confused about what has happened or about whether or not to

speak out;

blame him/herself for what has happened or be afraid that he/she

will be blamed for it and punished;

be afraid of the consequences of speaking about it, either for

him/herself and/or for another member of the family;

may feel that s/he may not be believed;

may have been told to say nothing and threatened with the

consequences of doing so;

may be embarrassed because s/he did not appreciate at the time

that what was happening was wrong, or because s/he enjoyed

some of the aspects of the attention they were getting;

simply blank what happened out and get on with their lives until

the point comes when they feel ready or the need to speak out {e.g.

for the sake of a younger child who s/he feels may be at risk};

may feel conflicted: loving the abuser but hating the abuse.

In addition, in, The Crown Court Bench Book (published in March

2010 - at page 367) it is stated as follows:

Children do not have the same life experience as adults. They do not

have the same standards of logic and consistency, and their

understanding may be severely limited for a number of reasons, such as

their age and immaturity. Life viewed through the eyes and mind of a

child may seem very different from life viewed by an adult. Children may

not fully understand what it is that they are describing, and they may

not have the words to describe it. They may, however, have come to

realise that what they are describing is, by adult standards, bad or, in

their perception, naughty.

Apart from that in Daradagamage Chandraratne Jayawardane

alias Shantha v. The Attorney General - Court of Appeal case No.

CA/85/2013, decided on 25.05.2018, it was observed as follows:

Time and again courts have discussed the acceptance of evidence of

children of tender ages. Our judges are not there to test the memory of

the witness, they are expected to find actual fact and the truth. Witnesses

are human beings, they are not memory machines nor robots to repeat

the incident as it was. Further, the natural behaviour of human beings is

to forget incidents, especially sad memories. No one wants to re-visit

painful moments and keep detailed memories with them. We are also

mindful most of our courts with due respect, are not child friendly.

In the case at hand, the victims own father raped her twice according

to the victim. The reason given by her for not telling anybody about this

and not complaining to the police is that she was afraid of the

consequences of speaking about it as specified above. The victim stated

in her evidence that the appellant father told her that if she spoke about

this, her mother and she would be killed. Not only that, the victim

stated that the father tried to throw acid once (pages 96 and 113 of the

appeal brief). In addition, as the learned SDSG contended, the victim

daughter had no reason to falsely accuse her father of raping her.

Whatever disputes the father had with her mother, a daughter would

never falsely accuse her father of raping her. In the circumstances, I

hold that an acceptable reason has been given for the delay of making

a statement to the police and therefore, the belatedness of making a

complaint has no impact on the prosecution case.

Prosecutrixs testimony is not reliable.

In the written grounds of appeal tendered by the learned Counsel for

the appellant, the basis of grounds 1, 2, 5 and 6 is that the prosecutrix

testimony is not reliable. The learned Counsel has pointed out some

infirmities and an inconsistency per se in the evidence of the

Page 9 of 14

prosecutrix. The inconsistency that the learned Counsel pointed out

was that in explaining the first incident, although she stated that her

fathers penis was inserted into her vagina in her evidence in chief,

when she was cross-examined, she stated that she did not allow her

father to do anything and father only attempted to harass her.

Therefore, the learned Counsel contended that there was not only a vital

inconsistency but also, there was no rape in the first incident, according

to PW-1.

Explaining the second incident, PW-1 had clearly stated how her father

raped her. When questioned about the first incident, she has given an

explanation that since the first incident was not as serious as the

second incident, she said that she did not allow her father to do

anything. Her explanation can be accepted as an explanation of a child

because it transpires from the evidence that bleeding took place in the

second incident but not in the first incident.

Apart from that, some inconsistencies and omissions were pointed out

by the learned Counsel for the appellant. All these omissions and

contradictions have been considered by the learned Trial Judge and he

explained in his Judgment, the effect of those inconsistencies and

omissions and correctly concluded that those inconsistencies and

omissions do not affect the credibility of the victim, PW-1. The only

omission that can be considered as an omission with some effect is not

stating about the SMS in her police statement by PW-1. However, the

mother has clearly explained in her evidence how she saw the SMS and

the subsequent events that led to make the first complaint. The mother

of the victim has stated about the SMS in her police statement.

Therefore, the said omission is not material because there was no

dispute at all about the mother seeing the SMS and the subsequent

events that took place after seeing the SMS. Also, it is apparent that

Saman Kumara sent a reply SMS because PW-1 informed him about

the fathers harassment through an SMS.

Page 10 of 14

The prosecutrix was a 13 years old child when she faced this

unfortunate incidents. She gave evidence after 8 years of the incidents.

Under these circumstances, the HCJ is correct in deciding that she is a

reliable witness.

The next matter to be considered is whether PW-1s testimony could be

acted upon without corroboration. The learned Counsel for the

appellant contended that it is essential to corroborate the evidence of

the prosecutrix in a rape case. The learned SDSG contended that the

prosecutrix evidence has been corroborated by the evidence of the

doctor who examined her and the consultant psychiatrist who

examined her. He pointed out that according to the psychiatrist, the

victim had an adjustment disorder type of depression, and this is

consistent with the history given by the victim. Also, the Judicial

Medical Officers evidence that there was an old tear of hymen at 6 O

clock position and the answer given by the JMO in cross-examination

that her observations are consistent with penetration to vagina more

than once, corroborate the evidence of the prosecutrix, the learned

SDSG submitted.

Now, I proceed to consider the legal issue whether the corroboration is

essential to act upon the evidence of the prosecutrix in a rape case.

There are Judgments to the effect that victims evidence need

corroboration to prove sexual offences. In the Indian Supreme Court

case of Gurcharan Singh v. State of Haryane -AIR (1972) SC 2661,

the necessity of corroborating evidence is explained as follows: As a

rule of prudence, however, court normally looks for some corroboration

of her testimony so as to satisfy its conscience that she is telling the

truth and that the person accused of rape on her has not been falsely

implicated. However, it is apparent from perusing the relevant

judgments that corroboration is not essential always. It was held in

Sunil and Another v. The Attorney General - (1986) 1 Sri L.R 230

that it is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a

Page 11 of 14

women victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing, such

evidence could be acted on, even in the absence of corroboration.

In the cases of The King v. Themis Singho - 45 N.L.R 378 and

Premasiri and Another v. The Queen - 77 NLR 85 it was held that in

a charge of rape, it is proper for a jury to convict on the uncorroborated

evidence of the complainant only when such evidence is of such a

character as to convince the jury that she is speaking the truth.

Also, it was decided in Regina v. W.D Dharmasena - 58 N.L.R 15 that

in a charge of rape, it is not in law necessary that the evidence of the

prosecutrix should be corroborated.

In the case at hand, although there are some shortcomings in the

evidence of the prosecutrix, when analyzing her evidence keeping in

mind the mental condition of a daughter who was raped by her father

with the other circumstances relevant to the incident, and the fact that

she gave evidence after eight years of the incident, there is no reason to

conclude that she is not telling the truth. It must not be forgotten that

the natural behaviour of human beings is to forget incidents, especially

sad memories. No one wants to re-visit painful moments and keep

detailed memories with them as decided in the aforesaid Judgment of

Daradagamage Chandraratne Jayawardane alias Shantha v. The

Attorney General.

It is vital to note that the Indian Supreme Court in Bhoginbhai

Hirjibhai v. state of Gujarat - (1983) AIR S.C 753 went onto the extent

of stating that In the Indian setting, refusal to act on the testimony of

a victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is

adding insult to the injury.

In the case at hand, the prosecutrixs evidence has been corroborated

by the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer and the Psychatrist as

pointed out by the learned SDSG. For the reasons stated above, the

Page 12 of 14

prosecutrixs testimony is reliable and the learned High Court Judge is

correct in acting upon her testimony.

Rejection of the dock statement is legally flawed.

The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the learned Trial

Judge had shifted the burden to the accused-appellant to prove his

version and since the accused had not proved his version, the learned

Judge wrongly rejected the dock statement. I regret that I am unable to

agree with that contention because the learned Judge has extensively

analyzed the dock statement from page 80 to page 83 of his Judgment

and found that the dock statement is improbable and unbelievable. The

learned Judge has not shifted any burden to prove anything to the

accused-appellant. Since the dock statement is improbable and

unbelievable, he rejected it. It is obvious that the improbable and

unbelievable dock statement of the appellant does not raise any

reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. A reasonable doubt arises

only if there is some probability in the defence version. In addition, it

must be noted that the learned Trial Judge has considered the

suggestions made on behalf of the accused-appellant to the prosecution

witnesses and found with reasons as to why those suggestions do not

raise a reasonable doubt on the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.

Therefore, the argument that the rejection of the dock statement is

legally flawed has no merit.

Section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance operates against the

prosecution for its failure to lead the evidence of Saman Kumara.

Section 114 Illustration (f) reads as follows: Evidence which could be

and is not produced would if produced, be unfavourable to the persons

who withholds it. This is a presumption. The contention of the learned

counsel for the appellant was that this presumption must be applied

for the failure of the prosecution to call Saman Kumara in evidence. The

learned counsel contended that the entire incident was disclosed after

Page 13 of 14

three and half years because of Saman Kumara and that is why it is

important to call Saman Kumara to give evidence.

It is correct that according to the mother, she inquired PW-1 regarding

the fathers harassments after seeing the reply SMS sent by Saman

Kumara in response to the SMS sent by PW-1. The next day, PW-1

revealed her mother about the incidents of rape. The defence has not

challenged the aforesaid way of disclosing the incidents. So, what else

can be elicited by calling Saman Kumara in evidence? If he was called

to give evidence, he would have stated that when he received an SMS

from PW-1, he sent an SMS asking whether there were harassments

from her father. It is clear that apart from that, Saman Kumara could

not say anything about the incidents relating to the charges because

even about the fact that the father had harassed PW-1, he came to

know after receiving an SMS from PW-1. As the witnesses need not be

called to prove undisputed facts, there was no necessity to call Saman

Kumara in evidence. Hence, this ground of appeal also fails.

At this point, I wish to highlight a very important point which both the

learned Counsel did not bring to the attention of the Court. The fact

that PW-1 informed Saman Kumara through an SMS that her father

harassed her has not been disputed by the defence. It is clear that what

she meant by harassing was sexual harassment. It is evident that she

informed him about her fathers harassment and that is why her mother

found a reply SMS sent by Saman Kumara asking whether there was

harassment from the father. All the arguments on behalf of the

appellant were based on the premise that she might have had sexual

intercourse with Saman Kumara and falsely implicated her father in

raping her. There is a clear reason why this cannot happen. If she had

sexual intercourse with Saman Kumara, she would never have informed

Saman Kumara through an SMS that her father sexually harassed her

for the obvious reason that they knew that she had sex with no one else

but with him. Therefore, no reasonable doubt arises as to whether

Page 14 of 14

PW-1 had sex with Saman Kumara and then falsely implied her father

for raping her.

The Judgment of the learned High Court Judge is legally and factually

flawed.

For the reasons stated above, the Judgment of the learned High Court

Judge is factually and legally correct. Therefore, there is no merit in this

ground of appeal.

For the foregoing reasons, I find no reason to interfere with the

Judgement of the learned High Court Judge. The Judgment dated

17.12.2021, the convictions and the sentences passed on the accused-

appellant are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
