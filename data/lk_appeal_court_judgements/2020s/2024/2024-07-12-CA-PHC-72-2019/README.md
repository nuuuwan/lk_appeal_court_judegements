Introduction

The Petitioner - Respondent Respondent, the Respondent in this appeal,

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) filed information in the Magistrate

Court of Matara exercising jurisdiction under Section 57 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Primary Courts

Procedure Act) under Section 66 (1)(b) of the same Act against the 1st, 2nd and

3rd Respondent - Petitioner - Appellants, the Appellants in this appeal,

(hereinafter referred to as the Appellant). The Respondent alleged that the

Appellant obstructed the Petitioners peaceful possession of the land in question.

The 4th Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant and the 5th Respondent-Petitioner (now

deceased) subsequently intervened in the case.

CA/PHC/0072/2019

In his order dated 28th August 20011, the learned Magistrate held in favour of the

Respondent and ordered the Appellants not to disturb the Respondent's

possession until the rights of the parties are determined by a competent court.

Dissatisfied with the order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellants filed a

revision application in the High Court of Matara against the Magistrate's order,

which was assigned case No. REV/132/2001. By his order dated 15th October

2003, the learned High Court Judge dismissed the Appellants application and

ordered the Appellants to pay costs to the Respondent, jointly and severally2.

The Appellants appealed to the Court of Appeal against the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge, which was assigned case No. CA (PHC) 271/20033.

Despite the appeal, the 4th Appellant also filed a revision application, No. CA

(PHC) APN 266/2003, in the Court of Appeal against the same judgment.

However, since both an appeal and a revision application were filed against the

same judgment, the revision application was subsequently withdrawn4. When

the appeal was taken up for hearing on 15th July 2015, the learned Counsel for

the Appellant informed the Court that the Respondent had filed partition action

No. 21089/P in the District Court of Matara concerning the land subject to this

case. It was submitted that if the Respondent could give an undertaking to

maintain the status quo until the final determination of the partition action, the

Appellant would be willing to withdraw the appeal. In response, the learned

Counsel for the Respondent informed the Court that the Respondent was willing

to maintain the status quo until the final determination of the partition action.

Consequently, the Counsel for the Appellant moved to withdraw the appeal, and

the Court allowed the application for withdrawal, dismissing the appeal without

costs in the Court of Appeal. The proceedings before the Court on the day the

appeal was withdrawn are as follows5:

1 Vide order of the Magistrates Court at pp. 63 to 71 of the 2nd set of the documents in the appeal brief. 2 Vide order of the High Court, at pp. 90 to 97 of the 2nd set of documents in the appeal brief. 3 Vide the order filed of record at p. 98 of the 2nd set of documents in the appeal brief. 4 Vide the copy filed of record at p. 98 of the 2nd set of documents 5 Vide the copy filed of record at p. 98 of the 2nd set of documents.

CA/PHC/0072/2019

Counsel for the appellant submits, the partition case bearing No.

21089/P has been filed by the Petitioner Respondent Respondent in the

District Court of Matara, in respect of the land subject to in this case.

Further, he submits if the respondent will give an undertaking to maintain

the status quo until the final determination of the partition case, he is willing to

withdraw this appeal. Counsel for respondent submits that he will maintain the

status quo until the final determination of the partition case.

In the above circumstances, Counsel for the appellant moves to withdraw

this appeal. Application is allowed and appeal is dismissed without cost.

Upon consideration of the above order made by this Court, it is apparent that it

was the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant who brought to the Court's

attention that the Respondent had filed a partition action in the District Court of

Matara concerning the subject matter. He also indicated that if the Respondent

was willing to give an undertaking to maintain the status quo until the final

determination of the partition action, the Appellant would be willing to withdraw

the appeal. In response, the Respondent agreed to maintain the status quo until

the final determination of the partition action. Consequently, the learned Counsel

for the Appellant moved to withdraw the appeal, and the Court dismissed the

appeal without costs in the Court of Appeal.

Subsequently, the Respondent submitted a bill of costs along with a motion dated

11th August 2016, to the High Court of Matara, claiming the payment of costs

ordered by the learned High Court Judge in the judgment of case No.

REV/132/2001. The learned High Court Judge accepted the motion and, on 9th

September 2016, ordered the Registrar to assess the bill of costs and refer the

matter to the Magistrates Court for recovery6.

Thereafter, the learned Magistrate issued notice to the parties and, without

proceeding to recover the bill of costs submitted by the High Court, allowed the

parties to file objections, counter-objections, and written submissions on the

question of payment of costs. Subsequently, the matter was fixed for the Court's

6 At page 155 of the appeal brief.

CA/PHC/0072/2019

order. However, upon realizing that the Magistrate's duty was to recover the costs

ordered by the High Court, an order was made to pay the costs jointly or

severally.

Thereafter, the Appellant filed revision application No. REV/57/2018 in the

High Court of Matara against the order made by the learned Magistrate on 26th

January 2018.

The learned High Court Judge entertained the application and issued notice to

the Respondents. Subsequently, the Respondents filed objections, and both

parties submitted their written submissions. During the argument, the learned

Counsel for both parties made their submissions. On 14th June 2019, the learned

High Court Judge delivered a judgment dismissing the revision application and

affirmed the order made by the learned Magistrate on 26th January 2018.

However, the learned High Court Judge did not make any order regarding the

costs of the revision application.

Being aggrieved by the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of Matara, the

Appellants appealed to this Court, filing the instant appeal.

Analysis

On 20th August 2001, the learned Magistrate of Matara delivered an order in an

application filed by the Respondent under Section 66(1)(b) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act. The Magistrate held that the Respondent was in

possession at the relevant time and could continue in possession. Further, the

Magistrate ordered that the Appellants should refrain from interfering with the

Respondent's possession until the rights of the parties are determined by a

competent civil jurisdiction7.

The Appellants moved in revision to the High Court of Matara to revise the order

of the learned Magistrate. On 15th October 2003, the learned High Court Judge

dismissed the revision application and ordered the Appellants (Petitioners in that

7 The order of the Primary Court Judge dated 28th August 2001 is at page 63 of the second set of documents.

CA/PHC/0072/2019

case) to pay costs. Since the learned High Court Judge did not specify the

amount, it is presumed to be taxed costs.

The aggrieved Appellants filed both a revision application and an appeal in this

Court against the order of the learned High Court Judge8. Subsequently, the

revision application was withdrawn on 19th March 2004, without any costs being

ordered. Similarly, the appeal was withdrawn on 15th July 2015, based on terms

agreed upon by the parties, also without any costs being ordered. During these

proceedings, the Appellants informed the Court that the Respondent had initiated

a partition action concerning the subject matter of this case. The Appellants

indicated that they would withdraw the appeal if the Respondent agreed to

maintain the status quo until the partition action is concluded. In response, the

Respondent gave an undertaking to maintain the status quo until the final

determination of the partition action, and accordingly, the Appellants withdrew

their appeal.

Notably, when the appeal was dismissed by this Court upon the Appellants

application to withdraw it, this Court did not make any order regarding the costs

that were ordered by the High Court in revision application No. REV/132/2001.

Neither the Appellants nor the Respondent made any application regarding costs

ordered in the High Court.

The obvious result of withdrawing both the appeal and the revision application

filed in the Court of Appeal is that the judgment delivered by the High Court in

case No. REV/132/2001 on 15th October 2003, and the original order made by

the learned Primary Court Judge on 28th August 2001, remain intact. Therefore,

the order for the payment of costs in the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge also stands.

In light of the analysis provided above, it is my considered view that the

Appellants are liable to pay costs ordered in the High Court case No.

REV/132/2001. Consequently, this appeal ought to be dismissed.

8 CA(PHC) 271/2003.

CA/PHC/0072/2019

The next matter that requires consideration of this Court is awarding of costs in

this appeal.

As I have already analysed above in this judgement the Appellants being

aggrieved by the decision of the learned Magistrate moved in revision to the

High Court. The learned high Court Judge having considered the merits of their

application dismissed the same subject to costs. Thereafter, against the above

judgment the Appellants filed a revision application as well as an appealed to

this Court. Subsequently, both were withdrawn. Thereafter, when an application

for the payment of costs ordered by the High Court was made the Appellants

resisted. The amount of costs claimed by the Respondent was Rs. 20,750/=

which was reduced to Rs. 9,000/- by the Registrar of the High Court upon his

calculation. The Appellants, refusing to pay, proceeded to file objections and

written submissions before the Magistrate, which were countered by the

Respondent. When the learned Magistrate ordered the payment of costs the

Appellants moved in revision to the High Court. Upon dismissal of their revision

application by the learned High Court Judge the Appellants filed the instant

appeal in this Court.

It is pertinent to note that apart from the costs ordered by the learned High Court

Judge in case No. REV/132/2001, the Appellants were not ordered to pay costs

in any other instances, despite there being numerous applications arising from

the order of the learned Magistrate.

Costs are ordered by courts to cover the expenses incurred for litigation by the

successful party. The costs typically include fees, charges, and disbursements.

Costs are usually ordered in the discretion of the Court. However, the discretion

must be exercised judicially. Costs are also ordered by Court suggesting its

disapproval of a partys conduct.9

I acknowledge the Appellant's right to contest any order in a higher forum.

However, I am of the view that in this instance, the Appellants have challenged

9 A Dictionary of Law, L. B. Curzon, 2nd Edition, at p. 86.

CA/PHC/0072/2019

every Court order in higher forums, potentially to harass the Respondent or to

hinder the recovery of the costs ordered, amounting to Rs. 9,000/- only.

In the case of Leon Peris Kumarasinghe v Samantha Weliverya Director

General, Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation10 Her Ladyship Tilakawardane J.,

in refusing to grant special leave to Appeal to the Supreme Court in a matter

arose out of a decision of a Magistrates Courts made the following observations.

() This Court cannot over emphasize the need to appropriately deal with

litigants who attempt to abuse the process of Court and thereby cause

unnecessary delay and costs to other parties in order to ensure that, in the future,

litigants will not be tempted to indulge in such ill-conceived practices. Thus,

considering the conduct of the Petitioner and the fact that he has abused the

process of Court by filing several applications in different Courts at different

times without vacating from the land and premises in question for more than

three years, we direct the Petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 200, 000 as costs to the

Director General, Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation within a period of one

month from today

Her Ladyship also cited the following authorities from foreign jurisdictions to

support the above contention.

In the case of Wilkes v. Woods11 it was observed that costs are ordered not only

as a satisfaction to the injured person, but also as a punishment to the guilty, to

deter from any such proceedings in the future.

In the cases of Kwan v. Kaplan12, it was held that a punitive costs order would

serve a dual role; to hold the Petitioner accountable and to serve as a mark of the

disapproval and displeasure of the Court with regard to the conduct of the

Petitioner.

10 S.C.Spl.L.A.No.37/2012. 11 (1964) 98 ER 489. 12 (2012) (ZAGPJHC 36) and Mohapi and others v. Magashule and others (2007) (ZAFSHC 45).

10

CA/PHC/0072/2019

The Supreme Court of U.S.A. in Smith v. Wade13, noted that the primary

justification for such an award is punishment and to deter similar actions in the

future.

The Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea in the case of Polye v. Papaki and

another14, determined that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was invoked

without reasonable cause which amounted to a misconduct on the part of the

Appellant resulting in unnecessary expenditure by the Respondents and granted

punitive damages accordingly.

Her Ladyship Tilakawardane J. in the aforementioned case further observed that

having two separate appeals stemming from the same order simultaneously

squanders valuable time and resources available to the legal system, justifying

the imposition of punitive costs. In this case, the Appellants had previously filed

both a revision application and an appeal against the order made by the High

Court in case No. REV/132/2001. They later withdrew both the revision

application and the appeal. However, as mentioned earlier, this Court did not

award any costs in either instance.

Conclusion

In the above circumstances, I am of the view that this is an appropriate instance

to order the Appellants to pay exemplary costs to the Respondent. Therefore, I

dismiss this appeal and order the Appellants to pay Rs. 100,000/- to the

Respondent as costs of this appeal.
