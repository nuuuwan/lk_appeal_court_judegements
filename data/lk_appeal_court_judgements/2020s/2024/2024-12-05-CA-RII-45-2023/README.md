JUDGMENT

M.C.B.S. Morais J.

This is an application for restitutio-in-integrum Under Article 138 of the Constitution of the

Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

In this case, the Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Petitioner) Mallika Arachchige Tereshma Rashmi Perera, is challenging the order

dated 30th of January 2023 and 19th of October 2023 of District Court of Colombo Case No.

DDV/778/16.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Respondent) initiated action on 18th of October 2016, against the Petitioner seeking Divorce

under the matrimonial fault of constructive malicious desertion.

Having allegedly served summons by the substitute service on 05th of April 2017 and given

the Petitioner have failed to appear and was not represented, the case against the Petitioner

was fixed for an ex parte hearing on 25th of April 2017.Accordingly, an ex parte hearing was

held and decree nisi was ordered against the Petitioner . Subsequently, the Petitioner filed a

Petition, under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code. In response, the Respondent filed

objections, and the matter was scheduled for inquiry. After the inquiry, the learned Additional

District Court Judge of Colombo by his order dated 08th September 2022, has refused the

application of the Petitioner sought under section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code and

ordered to absolute the decree nisi.Consequently, a Petition of Appeal was made by the

Petitioner on the 09th of January 2023 to the Civil Appellate High Court of Western Province,

seeking to set aside the order of the District Court dated 08th September 2022. However, the

Petition of Appeal was refused by the learned District Court Judge by his order dated 30th

January 2023.

Further, the Petitioner filed a Petition on 03rd of April 2023, seeking to vary the order under

section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code. After the inquiry by written submission, the learned

Additional District Court Judge refused the application by his order dated 19th October 2023.

The learned Judge of the District Court of Colombo has determined in his order, the petition

of appeal filed by the Petitioner on 9th of January 2023 is not within the time prescribed by

law and the documents did not contain the official seal of the Peace Officer. Therefore, the

learned Additional District Court Judge has refused the application under Section 755(3) of

the Civil Procedure Code, due to lapse of time and failure to include the signature of the

Peace Officer.

The section 755 of the Civil Procedure Code reads as follows,

(1) Every notice of appeal shall be distinctly written on good and suitable paper and

shall be signed by the appellant or his registered attorney and shall be duly stamped. Such

notice shall also contain the following particulars:-

(a) the name of the court from which the appeal is preferred;

(b) the number of the action;

(c) the names and addresses of the parties to the action ;

(d) the names of the appellant and respondent;

Page 5 of 6

(e) the nature of the relief claimed: Provided that where the appeal is lodged

by the Attorney-General, no such stamps shall be necessary.

(3) Every appellant shall within sixty days from the date of the judgment or decree

appealed against present to the original court a petition of appeal setting out the

circumstances out of which the appeal arises and the grounds of objection to the judgment or

decree appealed against, and containing the particulars required by section 758, which shall

be signed by the appellant or his registered attorney. Such petition of appeal shall be exempt

from stamp duty. Provided that, if such petition is not presented to the original court within

sixty days from the date of the judgment or decree appealed against, the court shall refuse to

receive the appeal.

Accordingly, the law requires that the Petition of Appeal be presented to the original courts

within 60 days from the date of the decree appealed against and signed by the Appellant or

his registered Attorney. However, the Petitioner has not followed these mandatory

requirements.

In the case of Wickremasinghe V. De Silva (1978) 2 SLR 65, it was held .....

The provisions of section 755 (3) of the Civil Procedure Code which requires the

petition of appeal to be filed within sixty days from the date of judgment are mandatory.

Accordingly, where a petition had been filed after sixty days had elapsed, the learned

District Judge was correct in rejecting such a petition......

The Original order made by the learned Additional District Court Judge dated 08th September

2022 was appealed by the Petitioner on 09th of January 2023 which was after 122 days.

Therefore, it is clear that the Petition of Appeal has not been made within 60 days from the

decree appealed against.

Furthermore, in the case of Municipal Council of Colombo V. Piyasena (1980) 2 SLR 39,

In the computation of the period of sixty days from the date of judgment set out in

section 755 (3) of the Civil Procedure Code for filing a petition of appeal, Sundays and

public holidays are not excluded and accordingly a petition filed sixty-five days after the

delivery of judgment is out of time.

Therefore, it is quite evident that the Petitioner has presented her Petition of Appeal out of

time and the learned Additional District Court Judge is correct in rejecting the Petition

without forwarding it to the Civil Appellate High Court of Western Province.

Accordingly, I do not see any reason to interfere by exercising the extraordinary remedy

granted by Article 138 of the Constitution. Therefore this application is dismissed.

No Cost ordered.
