ARGUED ON : 22.01.2024

DECIDED ON : 22.02.2024

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Embilipitiya

on three counts of grave sexual abuse, offences punishable under

Section 365 B(2)B of the Penal Code. Three charges were framed on the

basis that the girl who is the first witness of this case and who was

about eight years of age at the time of the incident had been sexually

abused by the accused-appellant on three separate occasions during

the period from 01st of January 2014 to 16th May 2014 in Moraketiya.

After trial, the learned high court judge acquitted the accused-appellant

from the second and third counts and convicted him for the first count.

The accused-appellant was sentenced to eight years of rigorous

imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,000/- was imposed. Additionally, he

was ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 150,000/- which carries a

default sentence of 6 months rigorous imprisonment.

This appeal is preferred against the said conviction and sentence. Only

the accused-appellant filed written submissions prior to the hearing.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the appellant and

the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent made

oral submissions.

Briefly, the prosecution case is as follows:

The accused-appellant was using his three-wheeler to provide

transportation for school and preschool children, and the victim was

one of the children who had been traveling in the appellant's vehicle to

school. According to the victim, she was the last amongst the other

school children traveling in the transportation service to be dropped off

from the vehicle on the way back from school to their homes. The

accused-appellant had dropped off the other children at their homes

and then stopped the vehicle in a nearby forest area and forced the

victim child to perform oral sex on the accused-appellant inside the

three-wheeler. On these occasions, the accused-appellant lifted the

victim's school dress, removed her undergarments, and pulled on the

child's genitals. The victim child had been subjected to the same kind

of sexual abuse on several occasions, according to her.

The grounds of appeal have not been specifically stated in the written

submission tendered on behalf of the appellant. At the hearing of the

appeal, the learned counsel for the appellant based his arguments on

the following grounds:

I. PW-1 and PW-2 have both failed to specifically adduce evidence

in respect of the commission of alleged offences during the time

period stipulated in the charges.

II. In terms of Section 165(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act,

the accused-appellant did not have sufficient notice of the

particular place and the incident of what he is charged of as all

three charges were in respect of alleged incidents said to have

occurred over a particular period.

III. As the evidence in respect of charge one is also the same as the

evidence that was adduced in respect of the other two charges,

the learned trial judge could not convict the accused-appellant

for the first count when she decided to acquit the accused from

counts two and three.

Page 4 of 14

IV. The learned trial judge failed to apply the test of probability to the

evidence adduced at the trial.

V. The learned trial judge failed to do a proper evaluation and

application of the evidence adduced at the trial, especially, failing

to consider the contradictions inter se.

The learned senior DSG appearing for the respondent contended in

reply that when mentioning the time of the offence, a period of time can

be mentioned in the charge, and the same kind of offences committed

within twelve months can be brought in the same indictment. The

learned senior DSG contended further that all three charges in the

indictment have been framed in terms of Section 165(1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. While submitting that there was no issue

regarding the probability of the prosecution case, the learned DSG

pointed out that the evidence of PW-1 should be considered, keeping in

mind possible omissions, forgetfulness, and entanglements that can be

made by a child witness, and the learned trial judge has carefully and

extensively evaluated the evidence of the case, taking into account those

aspects relating to the evaluation of evidence.

In the case at hand, PW-1, the victim had not stated to her parents

about the sexual abuse she had experienced until her mother inquired

about it. In The Crown Court Compendium Part I (published in May

2016 - page 10-22), a childs reason for silence has been explained as

follows:

Experience has shown that children may not speak out about something

that has happened to them for a number of reasons. A child may

be confused about what has happened or about whether or not to

speak out;

blame him/herself for what has happened or be afraid that he/she

will be blamed for it and punished;

Page 5 of 14

be afraid of the consequences of speaking about it, either for

him/herself and/or for another member of the family (such as

{specify});

may feel that s/he may not be believed;

may have been told to say nothing and threatened with the

consequences of doing so;

may be embarrassed because s/he did not appreciate at the time

that what was happening was wrong, or because s/he enjoyed

some of the aspects of the attention they were getting;

simply blank what happened out and get on with their lives until

the point comes when they feel ready or the need to speak out {e.g.

for the sake of a younger child who s/he feels may be at risk};

may feel conflicted: loving the abuser but hating the abuse.

In the case at hand also, although the appellant continuously abused

the victim, she had not told about these incidents to her parents. It is

clear that one or more of the aforesaid factors may be the reason for not

informing her parents of those incidents. One of the main reasons for

her silence was fear. PW-1 stated in her evidence that the appellant had

threatened her that if she tells these things to her parents, her mother

and father would be killed (page 232 of the Appeal Brief). Also, PW-1

stated that once the appellant told her If she speaks about these

things, both of them would be killed (page 77 of the Appeal Brief).

According to the aforementioned reasons for childs silence, one of the

reasons for PW-1s silence is that she was afraid of the consequences of

speaking about it, either for herself and/or for another member of the

family. Another reason is that PW-1 may have been told to say nothing

and threatened with the consequences of doing so. Therefore, there is

no improbability in the prosecution case or there is no reason to draw

an inference that the prosecution story is an afterthought for the reason

of PW-1 not telling her parents about the sexual abuses done by the

appellant. However, it is apparent from the mothers evidence that the

victim had told her mother that she cannot travel in the appellants

Page 6 of 14

three-wheeler to the school, she had hidden when the appellant visited

their house and had shown unusual behaviours during the period of

time that she was being sexually abused.

Another issue had been raised on behalf of the accused-appellant in the

high court that even after the mother came to know about these sexual

abuses, she had not complained to the police immediately and there

was a delay in making a complaint to the police. The learned high court

judge has dealt with this issue. PW-2, the mother of the victim explained

why she could not go to the police immediately. Her explanations are

found on pages 254, 255 and it is my view that the said explanations

can be accepted. Before making a complaint, to the police, even the

father of the victim had met the appellant and inquired about this (page

264 of the Appeal Brief). It was held in the Court of Appeal case

Thimbirigolle Sirirathana Thero v. OIC, Police Station,

Rasnayakepura bearing No. CA No.194/2015, decided on 07.05.2019

it was held that when a child is sexually assaulted by an adult, it is

also natural for the victims family to think twice before making a

complaint to the police. There can be adverse effects on the child when

this kind of offence is exposed. Therefore, in the instant action, the

delay in making a complaint is clearly understandable.

Now, I proceed to consider the aforesaid grounds of appeal. Grounds I,

II, and III are with regard to the charges in the indictment, and they

could be considered together. In the indictment, there were three

charges of grave sexual abuse in terms of Section 365B(2)(b) of the

Penal Code. In all three charges, the act of grave sexual abuse

committed by the appellant has been explained. In all three charges,

the act of grave sexual abuse is the same. When describing the place of

the alleged offence in the charge, it is sufficient to state that the offence

was committed in Moraketiya and it is not essential to state the exact

place where the offence was committed because the particulars

mentioned in the charges are sufficient for the accused-appellant to

Page 7 of 14

understand the nature of the charges leveled against him. Therefore,

the manner of committing the offence and the place of the offence have

been described sufficiently in the three charges leveled against the

appellant.

According to Section 174(1), three offences of same kind committed by

an accused within a year can be brought together in the same

indictment. In specifying the time of the offence, a period of time within

twelve months could be stated. In the instant case, three charges were

framed on the basis that sexual offences of similar nature were

committed within the specified period mentioned in the first charge.

Hence, the charges in the indictment have been framed in accordance

with Section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

In addition, the Supreme Court in A.K.K.Rasika Amarasinghe V.

O.I.C. Special Investigating Unit and Hon. Attorney General - SC

Appeal No.140/2010 decided on 18.07.2018 held that it is well-settled

law that if a charge sheet is defective, objection to the charge sheet must

be raised at the very inception. In determining this case, the Supreme

Court relied on the judgment King V. Kitchilan reported in 45 NLR 82,

wherein the Court of Criminal Appeal held that The proper time at

which an objection of the nature should be taken is before the accused

has pleaded,

Hence, even if the accused-appellant did not have sufficient notice of

the place and the incident of which the appellant is charged, it is too

late to raise that objection because the arguments raised by the learned

counsel for the appellant regarding charges cannot be raised at the

stage of appeal according to the aforesaid Supreme Court decision.

Anyhow, it has been explained previously that the accused-appellant

had sufficient notice regarding the place and the incident of which he

is charged, and thus, the aforesaid ground II of appeal is devoid of merit.

Page 8 of 14

The learned high court judge found that an act of sexual abuse

explained in the charges had been committed at least in one occasion

within the period of time specified in the first charge. Therefore, the

learned judge convicted the appellant for the first charge. Although

there was evidence that the appellant sexually abused PW-1 several

times in the same manner, the learned judge has not convicted the

appellant for the second and third charges because there was no proof

that the other occasions where PW-1 was sexually abused in the same

manner by the appellant fell within the period of time specified in the

charges. Therefore, I regret that I am unable to agree with the argument

that when the appellant was acquitted of the second and third charges,

he could not be convicted of the first charge.

As explained previously, the learned trial judge has found with reasons

that the sexual offence described in the first charge had been committed

within the period specified in the said charge. PW-1 or PW-2 has not

stated in their evidence a specific date on which the sexual abuse has

occurred. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant was

that PW-1 and PW-2 have both failed to specifically adduce evidence in

respect of the commission of alleged offence during the time period

stipulated in the charges.

Now, I proceed to consider the aforesaid argument. PW-2 made the first

complaint regarding the sexual abuse to the police on 05.06.2014. It

transpires from the evidence of the case that the mother went to the

police station three weeks after becoming aware of this incident. That

means she became aware of the incident 21 days before 05.06.2014.

Therefore, it can be assumed without any doubt that the incident

occurred before 16th of May 2014. Also, the evidence reveals that PW-1

was sexually abused by the appellant when she was in Grade 4 in the

year 2014. Hence, the offence must have been committed on a certain

day between the 1st of January 2014 and 16th of May 2014. Thus, it is

clearly established that the offence for which the appellant was

Page 9 of 14

convicted was committed within the time frame stipulated in the first

charge.

In Archbold Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice 2019 1-225

at page 83 the case of R. v. Dossi, 13 Cr. App.R. 158 was discussed as

follows:

In Dossi (supra), it was held that a date specified in an indictment is

not a material matter unless it is an essential part of the alleged offence;

the defendant may be convicted although the jury finds that the offence

was committed on a date other than that specified in the indictment.

For the reasons stated above, I hold that the aforesaid grounds I, II and

III are devoid of merit.

Another ground of appeal raised is the probability of the prosecution

case. PW-1 testified that when she was returning from school in the

appellant's three-wheeler, the appellant dropped all the other children

who were traveling with her, and when she was alone in the three-

wheeler, the appellant drove her to a remote and isolated location, and

then, she was sexually abused. The learned counsel for the appellant

stated that, according to the evidence of PW-2, the victim's mother, the

appellant's son, and daughter were also there among the children who

returned home in the three-wheeler with PW-1, and thus, PW-1 could

not have remained in the three-wheeler alone. The learned counsel

contended further that the evidence of PW-2 raises a serious concern

about the probability of the occurrence of the alleged incident narrated

by PW-1. In response, the learned Senior DSG pointed out that PW-2

has not stated that she saw all the children traveling with PW-1 were in

the three-wheeler every day.

It is correct that PW-2, the mother of the victim in her evidence did not

state that she observed all of the children traveling with PW-1 in the

Page 10 of 14

three-wheeler every day. In addition, although PW-2 stated the order in

which children usually get off the three-wheeler, she had not stated that

every day during the period specified in the charge, all the children were

dropped off according to the same order. It is apparent that if the

appellant wanted to sexually abuse PW-1, he would select an occasion

where PW-1 was alone in the three-wheeler. PW-1s evidence was that

on a day that she was alone in the three-wheeler, the incident

happened. Therefore, because of the evidence of PW-2, no improbability

occurs with regard to PW-1s evidence that on this particular day, when

she was alone in the three-wheeler, the appellant sexually abused her.

The victim in this case was eight years old when she was sexually

abused. She gave evidence in the High Court after six years of the

incident. In the said circumstances, when considering the fifth ground

of appeal, I wish to focus on the following factors outlined in The Crown

Court Bench Book (published in March 2010 - at page 367) that should

be considered when evaluating the evidence of a child witness.

Children do not have the same life experience as adults. They do not

have the same standards of logic and consistency, and their

understanding may be severely limited for a number of reasons, such as

their age and immaturity. Life viewed through the eyes and mind of a

child may seem very different from life viewed by an adult. Children may

not fully understand what it is that they are describing, and they may

not have the words to describe it. They may, however, have come to

realise that what they are describing is, by adult standards, bad or, in

their perception, naughty.

Taking into consideration the aforesaid guidelines, the next ground of

appeal to be addressed is the evaluation of evidence by the learned trial

judge, with a special focus on the impact of the contradictions inter se

and omissions demonstrated by the learned counsel for the appellant.

I have dealt previously with the contradiction between PW-1 and PW-2

Page 11 of 14

shown by the learned counsel and found that the said contradiction

inter se has no impact on the findings of the learned trial judge. The

learned high court judge had considered the omissions of the case and

stated in her judgment, the reasons why those omissions do not affect

the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.

However, it is necessary to consider whether the omissions of this case

affect the credibility of the prosecution case. Apart from the aforesaid

discrepancy in the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 about the order in which

the children were dropped off from the three-wheeler, the learned

counsel for the appellant did not show any other contradiction in this

case at the hearing of the appeal. He contended that there were about

10 to 12 omissions in PW-1s testimony that affected her credibility.

When the court asked the learned counsel to show vital omissions that

go to the root of the case, he pointed out the omissions that were

brought to the attention of the court appearing on pages 143,145,146,

and 152 of the appeal brief. The learned high court judge has dealt with

these omissions and she has correctly found with reasons why those

omissions do not affect the credibility of PW-1. I agree with her

reasoning and hold that none of these omissions affects the credibility

of the testimony of PW-1 because the testimony of a child must be

evaluated carefully considering the mentality of a child who is a victim

of sexual abuse.

When a child faces this kind of sexual abuse at the age of eight years

and gives evidence after six years of the incident, minor discrepancies,

omissions, and mixing up the sequence of events could occur. The

learned trial judge has evaluated the evidence of the case taking into

consideration the observations made in the case of Bharwada

Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat 1983 AIR 753, 1983 SCR

(3) 280. Therefore, in this judgment, I do not wish to repeat the said

observations in respect of the evaluation of evidence. Apart from that,

in Daradadagamage Chandraratne Jayawardane alias Shantha

Page 12 of 14

v. The Attorney General - Court of Appeal case No. CA/85/2013,

decided on 25.05.2018, it was observed as follows:

Time and again courts have discussed the acceptance of evidence of

children of tender ages. Our judges are not there to test the memory of

the witness, they are expected to find actual fact and the truth. Witnesses

are human beings, they are not memory machines nor robots to repeat

the incident as it was. Further, the natural behaviour of human beings is

to forget incidents, especially sad memories. No one wants to re-visit

painful moments and keep detailed memories with them. We are also

mindful most of our courts with due respect, are not child friendly.

PW-1s testimony must be evaluated considering the aforementioned

factors that are important in evaluating the testimony of a child. I find

that the learned trial judge has correctly evaluated the evidence of the

case considering those factors.

In addition, the learned judge had analyzed the dock statement of the

accused-appellant and found that the dock statement did not cast a

reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. In fact, the learned counsel

for the appellant did not make any submission to the effect that the

analysis of the dock statement is wrong.

In his dock statement, the accused-appellant denied the allegations

made against him. The appellant stated that this is a false allegation

made against him. According to him the reason for making a false

allegation was a minor dispute arose between the parents of PW-1 and

the appellant as a result of non-payment of seettu salli by the parents

of PW-1. When the said reason was suggested to the mother of the

victim on behalf of the appellant, it is precisely apparent from the very

answers she gave that they would never make a false allegation that

their daughter became a victim of a sexual abuse for a minor dispute

such as non-payment of seettu salli. Therefore, I wish to reproduce

the questions posed to her and the answers given by her.

(Page 262 of the Appeal Brief)

Anyone with common sense understands that in a rural area like

Moraketiya, the situation that a girl and her family will face when it

becomes known in the area that the girl has been sexually abused.

Parents would never falsely claim that their little daughter was sexually

abused, especially because of a minor incident such as a resentment

caused by not being able to settle "seettu salli", even though it is

assumed that the story of not settling seettu salli is true. Therefore,

the suggestion made on behalf of the appellant to PW-1 in cross-

examination for making a false complaint against the appellant was not

at all a suggestion based on a plausible reason. In addition, as the

learned high court judge correctly observed, a girl of this early age

cannot descriptively describe a sexual act of this nature as PW-1 did to

the police and in Court if it is a fabrication of her parents. For the

foregoing reasons, I hold that the reasoning in the impugned judgment

and the conclusions of the learned high court judge are correct.

Page 14 of 14

The learned counsel for the appellant did not canvass the sentence

imposed on the appellant. The sentence is reasonable and lawful.

Therefore, I find no reason to interfere with the judgment, conviction,

and sentence imposed by the learned high court judge.

Accordingly, the judgment dated 27.05.2022, conviction, and the

sentence imposed on the accused-appellant are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
