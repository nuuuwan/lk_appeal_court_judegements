ORDER

P. Kumararatnam, J.

This is an application in Revision preferred by the 5th Accused-

Appellant-Petitioner (Hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner)

challenging the conviction dated 30.09.2020 and the sentence dated

23.09.2022 imposed by the Learned Magistrate of Colombo and the

order dated 07.11.2023 of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

The Complainant-Respondent-Respondent-Respondent (Hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent) had filed the case bearing No. 76239/05

under the Termination of Employment of Workman (Special Provisions)

Amendment Act No.45 of 1971 the Ceylon Development Engineering

Company Ltd, where the Petitioner and the other Accused persons were

the Directors at the relevant time.

After the trial, the Learned Magistrate of Colombo found the Petitioner,

1st,2nd, and 3rd Accused guilty to the charge and convicted them on

30.09.2020 and sentenced them on 23.09.2022.

On 23.09.2022, the Petitioner was sentenced to 06 months

imprisonment and ordered to pay Rs.7123462.50. The Court further

ordered to pay a sum of Rs.50/- for each day until the full amount was

paid by the Petitioner.

Against the conviction and sentence of the Learned Magistrate of

Colombo, the Petitioner a lodged an appeal in the in the High Court of

Colombo. Despite several months passing since lodging the appeal, the

Petitioner claimed that he did not receive any notice from the High

CA (PHC)APN 148/23

Court. As such, the Petitioner had personally called on to the Registry

of the Colombo High Court No.08 to inquire as to the status of the

appeal. According to the Court records, the matter had been taken up

on 27.09.2023 and dismissed the same due to non-appearance of the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner states the Learned High Court Judge had dismissed his

appeal without considering the merit on 27.09.2023 which happened to

be a mentioned date for the Respondent to provide the Petitioners

correct address.

Although the Petitioner had filed a re-listing application in the High

Court of Colombo, but was dismissed on the ground that the Petitioner

had failed to exercise due diligence in prosecuting his appeal.

The Petitioner filing this revision application contends that the Learned

High court judge has failed to consider that no appeal can be dismissed

on a calling date due to the default appearance of the Petitioner or his

Attorney-at-law, as the High Court is required to dispose of criminal

appeal exclusively on its merits in terms of Section 349(3) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 and urge this Court to consider

this ground as an exceptional ground.

It is well settled law that the revision is a discretionary remedy that can

be granted only upon exceptional circumstances.

In Wijesinghe v Tharmaratnam (Sri kantha Law Report Vol-IV 47), the

court held that:

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available

unless the application discloses circumstances which shocks the

conscience of the Court.

CA (PHC)APN 148/23

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. V Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd.

1987 1 SLR 5 the Court held that:

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the

appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional

circumstances exist warranting its intervention.

On perusal of the Termination of Employment of workman (Special

Provisions) amendment Act No. 45 of 1971 there is no expressed

provision to appeal against a judgment passed by the Learned

Magistrate Court.

In Martin v Wijewardena [1989] 2 SLR 409 the Court held that:

A right of appeal is a statutory right and must be expressly

created and granted by statute. It cannot be implied.

The Above position was endorsed in Gamhewa v Maggie Nona and

others [1989] 2 SLR 250 by the Court of Appeal.

In Bakmeewewa, Authorised Officer of Peoples Bank v Konarage

Raja [1989] 1 SLR 231 the Supreme Court held that:

The jurisdiction exercised by the District Court under Section 72(7)

and (80) of the Finance Act as amended is a special jurisdiction

and there is no right of appeal from an order made in the exercise

of such jurisdiction, unless a right of appeal is expressly provided

for in the act. No right of appeal is provided in the act. Hence, the

District Court had no jurisdiction to entertain an application for

stay of execution pending appeal under Section 763(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code.

CA (PHC)APN 148/23

8 | P a g e

The above cited plethora of judgments clearly endorse the fact that a

right of appeal is a statuary right and must be created and granted by

statues.

As there is no appeal provision available in the Termination of

Employment of workers (Special Provisions) amended Act No. 45 of

1971, the Petitioner has no legal right to lodge an appeal against the

judgment and the sentence pronounced by the Learned Magistrate of

Colombo on 30.09.2020 and 23.09.2022 respectively. As such, the

Petitioner has no legal status to canvass the order made by the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo on 27.09.2023 in this revision

application.

As such, notice is refused in this case.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Order to the High

Court of Colombo and the Magistrate Court of Colombo for information.
