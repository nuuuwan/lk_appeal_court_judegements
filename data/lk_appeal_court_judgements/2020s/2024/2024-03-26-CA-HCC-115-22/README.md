WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for

committing the murder of one Ranathunga Arachchige Dinesh

Prasanna and in the same transaction, committing the murder of

Mayadunnage Chandralatha on 13th October 2008, offences punishable

under Section 296 of the Penal Code. After trial, the learned High Court

Judge convicted the accused-appellant on the two counts of murder

and imposed the death sentence on him. This appeal is preferred by the

accused-appellant against the said convictions and sentence.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of both

parties. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel

for the appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

respondent made oral submissions.

In brief, the prosecution case is as follows:

The two deceased persons who were shot dead, Chandralatha and

Dinesh Prasanna were mother and son. On the day of the incident,

around 7 a.m. in the morning, PW-4, the daughter of Chandralatha and

the sister of Dinesh was asleep in the room of their house. PW-4 was

suddenly awakened by a sound similar to a fire cracker followed by the

smell of gun powder. When PW-4 came out to the front portion of their

house, she saw the accused-appellant leaving their house with another

Page 3 of 13

person whom she could not identify. She has then seen her brother

fallen down shivering after receiving gunshot injuries. She has also seen

her mother who was seated on a bed in the front portion of the house,

fallen to a side. Thereafter, PW-4 had quickly arranged a three-wheeler

and sent her brother to hospital assuming that her mother had fainted

due to shock, after seeing his son being shot. When PW-4 returned to

the house after sending her brother to the hospital, she had witnessed

that her mother whom she assumed to have merely fainted had also

been shot at and sustained injuries. She had thereafter taken steps to

hospitalize her mother.

Even at the time of admission to the hospital, the brother of PW-4,

Dinesh Prasanna was dead. Her mother, Chandralatha, died from her

injuries nearly a month after the incident. One day after the incident,

while receiving treatment at the National Hospital, Chandralatha made

a statement to PW-8, Police Constable Saman Kumara. In the said

statement, the deceased Chandralatha stated that she identified

Sampath who was in Bandaranayakepura as the person who shot at

her and her son. She had signed the said statement. The dying

declaration was marked as P4 by the prosecution.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant formulated his

arguments on the following grounds of appeal:

i. The learned Trial Judge has failed to adequately consider the

facts in favour of the accused-appellant as required by law.

ii. The obvious infirmities in the case for the prosecution have

not been considered adequately and reasons for acting upon

the evidence notwithstanding such infirmities have not been

given.

iii. The dying deposition of the deceased has not been considered

utilizing the tests laid down by our courts.

iv. The defence of alibi taken up by the accused throughout the

trial has not been adequately considered.

Page 4 of 13

v. In view of the above circumstances, there has not been

adequate consideration of the defence case as required by law.

vi. Due to one or more of the above reasons, the accused has been

denied a fair trial, which is a constitutionally guaranteed

fundamental right of a person accused of an offence.

Apart from the aforesaid grounds of appeal, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the appellant contended that the chain of causation with

regard to the death of Chandralatha was not considered by the learned

High Court Judge. The learned DSG pointed out that the cause of death

of Chandralatha has not been challenged and therefore, there was no

necessity for the learned Trial Judge to specifically consider the chain

of causation.

The cause of death of Chandralatha mentioned in the cause of death

form (P3) has been recorded as an admission as the defence did not

challenge the cause of death (Page 121 of the appeal brief). As the

admitted facts need not be proved, I agree with the contention of the

learned DSG that it is not essential for the learned Trial Judge to

consider the chain of causation with regard to the death of

Chandralatha. It is established that the death of Chandralatha was due

to the Septicemia occurred as a result of firearm injuries. From the

Post-Mortem Report and the evidence of the Assistant Judicial Medical

Officer, it is established that the cause of death of Dinesh Prasanna is

cranio-cerebral injuries following discharge from a firearm or firearms.

Therefore, the deaths of both Chandralatha and Dinesh Prasanna had

occurred due to the injuries caused by a firearm.

The main contention of the learned Presidents Counsel was that the

sole eye witness PW-4 was not credible and convicting the appellant on

her evidence is wrong. The learned Presidents Counsel contended that

according to the testimony of PW-4, she had not clearly identified the

appellant as the person who shot at her mother and the brother,

Page 5 of 13

obviously, her attention was drawn to the injured brother. The learned

DSG appearing for the respondent contended that PW-4 is a credible

witness and her evidence could be acted upon. The learned DSG

submitted that PW-4 had made a prompt statement to the Police on

14.10.2008 after attending to the Post-Mortem Examination to identify

the body of her brother, Dinesh Prasanna. The learned DSG contended

further that the incident occurred between 7 and 7.15 in the morning,

the lighting condition was good at that time and the distance between

the appellant and the witness was about six feet.

In cross-examination, there was no suggestion to PW-4 at least that she

did not see two persons fleeing from the place of the incident soon after

the shooting. What was suggested on behalf of the accused in cross-

examining PW-4 is that the accused-appellant did not come to the place

of the incident, but his brother came there, and PW-4 saw the brother

of the accused, Upul and since both the brother and the accused look

alike, PW-4 mistakenly claims that the person that she identified at the

scene is the accused-appellant (Pages 53, 54 of the appeal brief). PW-4

stated in her testimony that she identified the person as Sampath.

However, it is apparent from the above suggestion made on behalf of

the appellant that the appellant had not disputed the fact that PW-4

saw two persons running away from their house. Defence suggestion

was that she misidentified one of the persons as the appellant instead

of appellants brother. Therefore, the only issue to be determined is

whether PW-4 correctly identified the appellant when she saw two

persons running away from the house. PW-4 stated in her evidence that

she could not identify one person, but the other person was identified

as Sampath, the appellant.

Chandralatha clearly stated in her dying declaration that Sampath, the

accused-appellant shot her and her son, Dinesh Prasanna. If the

learned Trial Judges decision is correct to accept the said dying

declaration as evidence, it can be concluded without any ambiguity that

Page 6 of 13

the accused-appellant committed the two murders because

Chandralatha had clearly identified the shooter as the appellant and

PW-4 also identified the appellant as one of the persons ran away soon

after the shooting.

In order to decide whether Chandralathas dying declaration can be

acted upon, it is pertinent to consider the legal position regarding the

acceptance of a dying declaration as evidence of a case.

A dying declaration can be admitted in evidence in terms of Section 32

of the Evidence Ordinance. In Ranasinghe V. Attorney General

(2007) 1 Sri L.R. 218 the tests that should be applied in accepting a

dying declaration as evidence are specified as follows:

When a dying declaration is considered as an item of evidence against

an accused person in a criminal trial the Trial Judge/Jury must bear

in mind the following weaknesses.

(a) The statement of the deceased person was not made under

oath;

(b) The statement of the deceased person has not been tested by

cross examination,

The Trial Judge/Jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on

the following matters:

(a) Whether the deceased in fact made such a statement;

(b) Whether the statement made by the deceased was true and

accurate;

(c) Whether the statement made by the deceased could be

accepted beyond reasonable doubt?

(d) Whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the

dying declaration could be accepted beyond reasonable

doubt?

(e) Whether the witness is telling the truth;

Page 7 of 13

(f) Whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged

declaration was made;

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant contended that none

of the aforesaid tests have been applied by the learned High Court

Judge in acting upon the dying declaration.

A dying declaration may be written or oral. If it is an oral statement

made by the deceased, the Court must consider whether the witness

who testifies about the dying declaration is truthful and whether the

deceased in fact made such a statement. In addition, the Court must

consider whether the statement made by the deceased was true and

accurate. In the case at hand, the dying declaration is not oral. The

Police Officer Saman Kumara recorded the statement of the deceased

Chandralatha and she had signed the statement. It is apparent that the

Police Officer did not want to implicate the appellant for this double

murder and write a false statement and obtain Chandralathas

signature for the statement. There is no evidence that the Police Officer

at least knew the appellant prior to the incident. Therefore, there was

no reason for the Police Officer to implicate the appellant.

As stated previously, the position taken up by the appellant was that

not the appellant but his brother came to the place of the incident and

PW-4 saw his brother running away. If the appellants brother shot at

Chandralatha and her son, there was no reason for Chandralatha to

mention that the appellant shot at both of them. She could have

mentioned the name of the appellants brother, as Chandralathas

family knew the appellants family for a long time. Therefore, it is

apparent that Chandralatha stated in her dying declaration that she

clearly identified the appellant because in fact she identified him

clearly. Hence, there was no reason for a false implication and it is

evident from Chandralathas dying declaration that PW-4 had not

misidentified the appellant.

Page 8 of 13

It is correct as contended by the learned Presidents Counsel that the

learned Trial Judge has not specifically stated in his Judgment about

the aforementioned tests to be applied in considering a dying

declaration. However, before accepting the dying declaration as

evidence, the learned Judge has considered some of the matters which

are said to be considered in these tests. One of the important matters

that the learned Judge has considered is that Chandralatha did not

have an opportunity to be taught by anyone before making the dying

declaration. The learned Judge observed that it is not revealed from the

evidence that even her daughter PW-4 had an opportunity to see

Chandralatha at the hospital before making the dying declaration (Page

17 of the High Court Judgement). After considering those relevant

matters, the learned Judge decided that the dying declaration had been

made independently without any tutoring or influence.

It is apparent from the evidence that when they were sleeping on the

floor of the room, the shooter came and fired at them. Therefore, in very

close proximity, Chandralatha could see the shooter. The appellant was

well-known person to Chandralatha as well as to PW-4. That is why

Chandralatha had stated in her dying declaration that I identified the

shooter very well as Sampath (,

Page 96 of the appeal

brief). In addition, the learned Trial Judge observed that there was no

suggestion from the defence about any other Sampath in that area. In

considering all these facts and circumstances, it is clear that

Chandralatha had the opportunity to identify the appellant very well.

Hence, I hold that it is correct in accepting the dying declaration of

Chandralatha as a true statement made by the deceased. The dying

declaration is also accurate because she explicitly stated that the

appellant shot both her and her son.

It was held in Sigera V. Attorney General (2011) 1 Sri L.R. 201 that

an accused can be convicted for murder based mainly and solely on a

Page 9 of 13

dying declaration made by a deceased without corroborating under

certain circumstances. It was held further that it would not be

repugnant or obnoxious to the law to convict an accused based solely

on a dying declaration. In Kumarasinghe Hettiarachchilage Gamini

Sarath V. The Hon. Attorney General C.A. Case No. 24/2015,

decided on 22.03.2019, it was held that A dying declaration as

evidence can be acted upon without corroboration, if it is found to be

true and reliable. In view of the aforesaid judicial authorities,

Chandralathas dying declaration can be acted upon even without

corroboration as it can clearly be accepted as true and reliable. Hence,

it is evident from the said dying declaration that the appellant had shot

and murdered Chandralatha and her son Dinesh Prasanna.

In the instant case, Chandralathas dying declaration has been

corroborated by the evidence of PW-4. On the other hand, no reasonable

doubt arises in respect of PW-4s evidence regarding the identity of the

accused-appellant because her identification is corroborated by the

dying declaration of Chandralatha. Therefore, it is established from the

prosecution evidence that the appellant murdered Chandralatha and

her son Dinesh Prasanna.

The next matter to be considered is whether the defence of alibi taken

up by the appellant has been properly considered by the learned Trial

Judge and whether the alibi creates a reasonable doubt on the

prosecution case. The position taken up in the alibi had been suggested

to the prosecution witnesses when they were cross-examined. The

defence of alibi taken up by the accused in making a statement from

the dock was that he was on official duty at Kotte Municipal Council at

that time. Furthermore, the appellant stated that the following day he

was arrested near Welikada Shed by a police officer called Saman.

There was no any other evidence documentary or oral, to show that he

was working in the Kotte Municipal Council on that day apart from the

statement made by the accused-appellant from the dock. However,

Page 10 of 13

according to our law, a defence of alibi could be taken up by a dock

statement and the accused has no burden to prove an alibi to any

degree of probability. If the plea of alibi raises a reasonable doubt on

the prosecution case, the accused must be acquitted.

In the case of Jayatissa v. Hon. Attorney General - (2010)1 Sri LR

279, the Supreme Court held as follows with regard to the plea of alibi:

Plea of alibi is not an exception to penal liability. Hence, there is no

burden of proof on the accused to prove a plea of alibi. Section 105 of

the Evidence Ordinance has no application to a plea of alibi. Evidence

of alibi has merely to be weighted in the balance with the prosecution

evidence.

When the defence sets up an alibi, the prosecution is entitled to lead

evidence in rebuttal.

It was also held that when an accused takes up an alibi as a defence,

three positions could arise;

(a) If the evidence is not believed the alibi fails,

(b) If the evidence is believed, it succeeds,

(c) If the alibi evidence is neither believed nor disbelieved, but

would create a reasonable doubt as to the prosecution case on

identity, the accused is entitled to get the benefit of the doubt.

Some of the fundamentals to be observed when an alibi is set up

as a defence have been specified in the said Supreme Court

Judgment as follows:

If an alibi is established by unsuspected testimony, that will be

satisfactory and conclusive.

An alibi should cover the time of the alleged offence so as to

exclude the accused's presence at the crime scene at the relevant

time.

Page 11 of 13

A false alibi will weaken the defence case and strengthen the

prosecution case.

Apart from the statement that

, the accused-appellant had not even stated a time that he

reported to work. No attendance register has been produced to show

the time that he reported to work or at least to demonstrate that he had

reported to work on 13.10.2008. According to the aforesaid Supreme

Court decision, an alibi should cover the time of the alleged offence so

as to exclude the accused's presence at the crime scene at the relevant

time. Undisputedly, the incidents relating to this case have occurred

around 7.10, 7.15 in the morning. The appellant has not even stated

that around 7.10, 7.15 in the morning, he was on duty at the Kotte

Municipal Council. Therefore, the said fundamental requirement that

an alibi should cover the time of the alleged offence has not been

fulfilled.

In addition, the appellant stated in his dock statement that he was

arrested by a police officer the next day after the incident. PW-8, Police

Sergeant Sunil Kumara testified that he arrested the appellant on

25.10.2008 at 14.15 hours. The appellants position was that a police

officer called Saman had arrested him. In cross examining PW-9, it

was suggested that the appellant was arrested at 8.30 in the morning

and PW-9 was not the police officer who arrested the appellant.

However, it was never suggested to PW-9 or any other prosecution

witness that the appellant was not arrested on 25.10.2008 and he was

arrested the very next day after the day that the incident occurred. So,

the date of arrest has never been challenged by the defence. Apart from

that, PW-9 stated that the appellant was absconding and, based on an

information received, he was arrested. The PW-9s evidence that the

appellant was absconding was also not challenged in cross-

examination. However, in the dock statement, the appellant stated that

he was arrested vey next day of the incident.

Page 12 of 13

As the unchallenged evidence of PW-9 could be considered as evidence

accepted by the appellant, appellants statement from the dock

regarding the date of the arrest cannot be believed. Also, it is apparent

from the aforesaid unchallenged evidence that the appellant was

absconding after the incident. Since the accused-appellant has not

stated in his dock statement that he was on official duty on 13th October

2008 around 7.00, 7.15 in the morning at the Kotte Municipal Council,

his alibi does not create any doubt on the prosecution case because the

dock statement cannot be believed.

It was held in the Indian Judgment of Sarvan Singh V. State of

Punjab (2002 AIR SC (iii) 3652) which was cited in the case of

Ratnayake Mudiyanselage Premachandra V. The Hon. Attorney

General C.A. Case No. 79/2011, decided on 04.04.2017 that It is a

rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to avail

himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination, it must

follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted. In

the case of Himachal Pradesh V. Thakur Dass (1983) 2 Cri. L.J. 1694

at 1701 V.D Misra CJ held that whenever a statement of fact made by

a witness is not challenged in cross-examination, it has to be concluded

that the fact in question is not disputed. Similarly, in Motilal V. State

of Madhya Pradesh (1990) Criminal Law Journal NOC 125 MP it was

held that Absence of cross-examination of prosecution witness of certain

facts, leads to inference of admission of that fact.

In view of the aforesaid judicial authorities, the defence of alibi fails as

stated previously. The learned High Court Judge has adequately

considered the alibi, the defence case and correctly rejected the dock

statement after recording reasons. Therefore, no reasonable doubt cast

on the prosecution case as a result of the accuseds dock statement.

For the foregoing reasons, I regret that I am unable to agree with the

grounds of appeal raised by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Page 13 of 13

appellant. The accused-appellant has not been denied a fair trial. As

the unbelievable alibi and the dock statement do not cast a reasonable

doubt on the prosecution case as explained previously, I hold that the

evidence presented by the prosecution proves the two charges against

the accused-appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, the Judgment dated 03.06.2022, the convictions and the

death sentence imposed on the accused-appellant is affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
