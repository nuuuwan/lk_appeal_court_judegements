Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

It is an admitted fact among the parties that the Petitioners at the time of filling the instant

Application were in the Medical Officer Grade and none were in the Specialist Medical

Officer Grade. The Petitioners state that all transfers including Annual Transfers of Officers

belonging to the Sri Lanka Medical Service have to be done according to a scheme approved

by the Public Service Commission (PSC) and the delegated power of the PSC in this regard

now vests with the Health Services Committee (Committee) of the PSC. The Petitioners

alleged grievance is that the Grade Medical Officers are transferred through the impugned

Page 26 of 33

Replacement List and such transfers are made without a transfer scheme for Grade Medical

Officers that has been approved by the said Committee of the PSC. In view of such, the

Petitioners contend that several letters/notices and relevant lists pertaining to the said

Replacement List for the Specialist Medical Officers are ultra vires; made out of jurisdiction

and are a complete nullity in law.

It appears that only Specialist Grade Medical Officers can apply for the Specialist Grade

Annual Transfer List which is generally finalized and published before the end of each year.

The 1st to 7th, 679th and 680th Respondents (Respondents) contend that the vacancies in the

Specialist Annual Transfer List are filled based on the exigencies of service and also to

accommodate those who have served two or more years in remote areas who are entitled to

apply for transfers as per their choice. The Respondents further contend that after finalizing

the Annual Transfer List certain posts remain vacant due to various reasons such as;

(i) Officers obtaining overseas leave or vacating their respective posts while the Annual

Transfer List is being processed.

(ii) the release of Officers to other institutions i.e.: Universities, Army hospital, Navy

hospital etc.

It is noted that the vacancies arising upon reasons similar to the above are filled through a

Replacement List. The learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who appears for the said

Respondents emphasizes the importance of the Replacement List and the necessity of

implementing the said List to overcome several anomalies that lead to undermining the entire

healthcare system. The learned DSG lists out such instances as below. (Vide- written

submissions of the said Respondents, pages 6-7).

A) There are certain hospitals where there is a very grave demand for a more qualified Acting

Consultant because that hospital caters to a large population;

B) The hospital is situated in an area where there is a high incidence of a particular disease which

requires a continuous and uninterrupted presence of a more qualified Acting Consultant

C) The hospital is in a remote area and there arent neighboring hospitals which can be accessed by

the residents of that area.

Page 27 of 33

D) The hospital is a Teaching Hospital which necessarily requires the more experienced Acting

Consultants as medical students/interns attend these hospitals for training and experience.

E) The hospital does not have a second Medical Officer who has expertise in that field which means

the sudden departure of the Medical Officer ted there disrupt the services of that facility.

Further, the learned DSG argues that it would not make sense to send a mere Senior Registrar

to respective hospitals for reasons similar to the above as;

a) A Senior Registrar does not have the experience and capability to handle the challenges

of such hospitals

b) As Senior Registrars have to travel abroad to complete their foreign training, there could

be a situation where these stations fall vacant once again within a short period of time.

Thus, there would be no continuity of service in these areas.

Thus, it is observed that filling the vacancies through the Replacement List is meant to

maintain service continuity at respective hospitals until such vacancies are permanently filled

through the Annual Transfers during the ensuing year. The Respondents have highlighted the

requirement of filling such vacancies among Officers very much similar to Specialists who

have returned to the Country after completing foreign training.

As it appears to me, the Petitioners as well as the Respondents concede that there are three

categories of Medical Officers as mentioned below:

(1) Category A - The Officers who have returned after foreign training and possess the

Board Certification.

(2) Category B - The Officers who have returned after foreign training but are awaiting

Board Certification.

(3) Category C - The Officers who have completed all the basic examinations and are

awaiting to travel abroad for foreign training (it is noted that they usually stay for a

short period and leave the Country for foreign training at their earliest)

Out of the above three categories, the Officers who fall under the categories A and B remain

in a station/post until the Annual Transfer takes place for the following year. The contention

of the Respondents is that the Officers in the above categories A and B are assigned to

several posts that have become vacant and which cannot be filled until the Annual Transfers

Page 28 of 33

for the ensuing year takes place. According to the Respondents the relevant vacancies are

usually identified at the duty stations in remote areas where there is no single Board Certified

Specialist. It was further submitted on behalf of the said Respondents that the vacancies that

occur after implementing the Annual Transfers need to be filled to assist/support the existing

Specialists but not to fill the 1st or 2nd posts permanently at the respective stations. Anyhow, if

no Officer is available from the above category A or B, an Officer from the above category

C will be offered such an essential post based on her/his seniority.

The learned DSG strenuously argued that the 1st to 3rd Respondents should be able to take

necessary steps under the exigencies of service to fill the vacancies that occur in several

stations due to one or more reasons mentioned above for the smooth functioning of the health

sector without uninterrupted services. It is noted that the assignment of Officers to respective

stations/posts through the Replacement List is a mere temporary arrangement without giving

them a higher title or remuneration. Such assignments seem to be valid only for a short period.

Anyhow the Petitioners contend that filling a vacancy through the Replacement List violates

the Constitution of the Republic and such an act would be ultra vires. The Petitioners argue

that under and in terms of Article 55(3) of the Constitution, the appointment, promotion,

transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of Public Officers are vested in the PSC. The power

concerning all transfers including Annual Transfers that need to be carried out according to

a scheme approved by the PSC, has been delegated to the said Committee of the PSC. The

Petitioners argue that alleged transfers made through the Replacement List have not been

approved by the said Committee and those are outside the Annual Transfers. Further, the

Petitioners contend that filling the vacancies of the respective posts using the word

assignment will eventually fall within the umbrella of the word transfer.

As opposed to such arguments, the Respondents submit that the respective assignments under

a Replacement List are temporary/interim measures and those are most certainly not

transfers. The Respondents argument is based on the fact that the Medical Officers who fall

within the aforementioned categories A,B and C are Officers who have not been absorbed

as Specialist Grade Medical Officers and as such they are not eligible to be transferred under

the Annual Transfer Scheme. The Respondents have given reasons for the necessity of

bifurcating the Replacement List by creating one list which contains the stations to which

Page 29 of 33

only Acting Consultants can apply and a second list which includes stations to which only

Senior Registrars can apply. At the hearing, the learned DSG having regard to the alleged

undeniable reality submitted that certain vacancies could not be filled with fully qualified

Specialists and such stations require the services of an Acting Consultant. One aspect of the

rationale for such bifurcation seems to be the requirement of assigning the Medical Officers

who have returned to Sri Lanka after foreign training, as a temporary measure, until they

become eligible to apply under the Annual Transfer List. The Respondents complain that the

Petitioners have filed the instant Application to avoid them being posted to stations in remote

areas.

This Court simply cannot overlook the fact that impoverished patients would ultimately be

benefited from the assignment or transfer of an adequate number of well-qualified Medical

Officers, meeting both academic and administrative criteria, to stations where their services

are vital. Similarly, as submitted by the learned DSG, the difficulties faced by the Authorities

who are responsible for the Administration in the Health Sector in this regard also need to be

taken into consideration. Likewise, this Court needs to take cognizance of the aforesaid urgent

requirements in the health sector that elaborated by the learned DSG. This imminent

requirement of assignment or transfer of such Officers exists perhaps until the Annual

Transfer List is published for the ensuing year. In the absence of an appropriate scheme or a

scheme properly approved by the PSC, a question arises as to how the relevant authorities of

the Ministry of Health should face the instances elaborated by the learned DSG who

emphasized the importance of maintaining the Health Service without any interruption,

especially in remote areas and the highly populated administrative areas.

There is no doubt that the powers of transferring Officers belonging to the Sri Lanka Medical

Service including Annual Transfers are vested in the said Committee of the PSC. However,

given the Gazette Extraordinary No.2004/49 (dated 01.02.2017) such transfers need to be

carried out according to a scheme approved by the PSC. Based on the submissions made by

the learned DSG and the learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners, it is implied that no

adequate scheme for Transfers of the Officers of the Sri Lanka Medical Service has been

approved as yet by the PSC. Anyhow, I need to draw my attention to the provisions in

Chapter XVIII of the Procedural Rules (Rules), published in Gazette Extraordinary

Page 30 of 33

No.2310/29 dated 14.12.2022, which deals with the Transfers of Public Officers. In terms of

Clause 250 (VI), the Transfers made on the exigencies of service shall not include the scope

of an Annual Transfer Committee. Furthermore, the provisions relating to transfers on

exigencies of service by an Appointing Authority or the Authority with delegated power are

declared in Clauses 258 to 262 of the said Rules.

I must now consider whether the alleged transfers or assignments carried out through a

Replacement List come under the above category of exigencies of service and whether such

transfers or assignments need to be approved by the committee of the PSC. On a careful

perusal of the learned DSGs reasons (for implementing a Replacement List) which is

reproduced in italics above in this judgement, it is observed that those reasons are well within

the category of exigencies of service. It is noted that even the transfers made on exigencies of

service ought to be made by the Appointing Authority or the Authority with delegated powers

as stipulated in the above Clause 258 of the Rules. However, Officers who fall in the above

categories A and B (which is within the three categories of Medical Officers as mentioned

above) are either not serving in any duty station or temporarily serving in a station soon after

returning to the Country after foreign training. An Officer who completes his foreign training

returns to the Country usually after remaining overseas for several months. Once such

Officers return to the Country, unlike the other Public Servants attached to various

Government Departments cannot report to the same station where he was serving just before

he left for foreign training. This is due to the fact that the nature of the service rendered by the

said Officers and the related administrative arrangements are distinct to such of other Public

Officers. Moreover, those Officers return to the Island with added qualifications compelling

them to assume duties in a higher grade than the one they were originally holding. Similarly,

this criteria applies even to the Officers who are awaiting Board Certification after foreign

training.

In light of the above, I take the view that the assigning of an Officer, who returns to the

Country after foreign training or after obtaining Board Certification, to a particular station,

certainly would not involve a change in his duty station. The reason for such, in my view, is

that an Officer who return to the Country with a feather on his cap with an added qualification

would not have been serving at a specific duty station at the time of returning to the Country

Page 31 of 33

to necessitate a change of station. This is a unique feature embedded in the Officers of the Sri

Lanka Medical Service. In order to effect a transfer, the change of a duty station is an essential

element. Hence, posting the Officers who are within the aforesaid categories A and B to

various stations cannot be assumed as transfers reflected in Chapter XVIII of the said Rules.

In my view, this is somewhat similar to an assignment of a station for a newly recruited

Medical Officer and no different opinion can be formed due to the reason that some of those

Officers are currently serving at several stations. This is merely because the respective Officers

are serving at relevant stations only on a temporary basis and only until they reach their

expected Grade.

Based on the submissions made on behalf of the Petitioners, it is abundantly clear that the

Petitioners at the time of filling the instant Application were awaiting Board Certification or

a permanent station as a consequence of completing their overseas training. In other words,

they have arrived in the Country at a stage where they could not apply for Annual Transfers.

Hence, the Ministry of Health will be compelled to post the Petitioners to appropriate stations

under exigencies of service until they would be entitled to apply for Annual Transfers.

Therefore, I hold that there is no legal impediment for the time being for the Ministry of

Health to assign the Petitioners in the instant Application to various stations through the

impugned Replacement List. I have arrived at the said conclusion only based on the facts and

circumstances of this Case and it should not be an impediment for any of the Petitioners to

challenge their individual assignments/posts upon reasonable and lawful grounds.

Furthermore, the criteria that will be adopted by the Authorities for such assignments or

postings is open to be challenged by any party if their interests are affected based on specific

grounds. I have found that the Petitioners have not explained to the Court as to whether their

personal interests have been affected consequent to the Replacement List. In this regard, I am

inclined to accept the arguments raised on behalf of the Respondents that the Petitioners have

failed to adduce a credible argument as to why the said Replacement List or the said

bifurcation is irrational and unfair. Additionally, I need to stress here that my above

conclusion does not absolve the lack of an appropriate scheme for transfers of the Officers

belonging to the Sri Lanka Medical Service.

Page 32 of 33

Moreover, this Court is compelled to take cognizance of the fact that the learned DSG

represents the Committee of the PSC which does not raise any objections against the

impugned Replacement List. In other words, the Attorney General in the instant Application

amplifies the version of the said Committee of the PSC. It is paramount to note that the said

Committee by way of a letter dated 13.07.2018 ('R4') has informed the Secretary of the

Ministry of Health that there is no necessity to obtain approval from the said Committee in

reference to the Replacement List. I am mindful that, this Court is not competent to inquire

into, or pronounce upon or in any manner call into question any order or decision made by

the PSC or the said Committee under Article 61A of the Constitution.

In addition to the above, I am unable to make a sufficient assessment of the present status

relating to each Officer from among the above-named 55 Petitioners. It can be easily assumed

that some of the Petitioners have already left the Country for foreign training or assumed

duties of higher Grades. The impugned Replacement List marked P7 and P9 were to be

effective for the year 2022. This Court on 12.01.2023 has decided that the Interim Order

issued on 09.03.2022 has no impediment for the Ministry of Health to advertise the Annual

Transfers of Specialist Medical Officers and to proceed accordingly based on the criteria

adopted for the year 2022. Further, this Court has taken the expressed view that the Interim

Order issued in this case will have no impediment for the Director General of Health Services

to give effect to any transfers which in his opinion fall within the category of exigencies of

services. Both the above orders have not been challenged by the Petitioners up to date.

Since this Court suspended the impugned Replacement List P7 and P9 until the final

determination of this Case, I take the view that no prejudice can be caused to the Petitioners

in reference to the Annual Transfers which may have been effected for the year 2023. Thus, I

am reasonably compelled to assume that the interest of several Petitioners upon the instant

Application have now substantially changed. This is because some of the Petitioners may

have applied for Annual Transfers for the year 2023 or some of the Petitioners would have by

now become eligible even for the Annual Transfers for the year 2024. Therefore, a reasonable

question arises as to whether it is a futile exercise for this Court to review impugned decisions

contained in the said P7 and P9. Nevertheless, I am of the view that there is no necessity

Page 33 of 33

for me to examine such questions at length as I have already reached a conclusion in this

Judgement on the effect of the impugned Replacement List.

Anyhow, considering all the circumstances of this Case, I take the view that the Petitioners

are not entitled to any of the reliefs as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition. I am not

convinced with the Petitioners Application based on Article 126(3) of the Constitution as it

does not appear to me that there is prima facie evidence of an infringement or imminent

infringement of the provisions of Chapter III or Chapter IV of the Constitution by a party to

the instant Application. Hence, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application.

Application is dismissed
