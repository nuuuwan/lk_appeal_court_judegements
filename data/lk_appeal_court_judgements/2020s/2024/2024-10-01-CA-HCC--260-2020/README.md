JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted by the Attorney General on following charges:

1. On or about 23rd May 2005 the accused committed the murder of

Pelawatte Hettige Dilshan Pushpakumara which is an offence

punishable under Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. In the course of the same transaction committed attempted murder of

Hewahelage Rosalin which is an offence punishable under Section 300

read with 32 of the Penal Code.

3. In the course of the same transaction committed attempted murder of

Pelawatte Hettige Sirimal which is an offence punishable under

Section 300 read with 32 of the Penal Code.

4. In the course of the same transaction caused grievous hurt to

Ilandaridevage Wimalasiri which is an offence punishable under

Section 315 read with 32 of the Penal Code.

As the Accused had opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led ten witnesses and marked productions

P1to P3 and closed the case. The learned High Court Judge being satisfied

that the evidence presented by the prosecution warrants a case to be

answered, called for the defence and explained the rights of the accused.

CA/HCC/0260/20

4 | P a g e

The 1st and 3rd Accused had made statements from the dock, the 2nd Accused

had given evidence from the witness box and the 4th Accused had remained

silent. The defence further adduced evidence of four witnesses on their

behalf.

After considering the evidence presented by both sides, the learned High

Court Judge had acquitted the 4th Accused from all the charges and found

the 1st Accused guilty under 3rd and 4th charges. The 2nd Accused (1st

Appellant) was found guilty under 1st and 2nd charges and the 3rd Accused

(2nd Appellant) was found guilty under 1st, 3rd and 4th charges and sentenced

them as follows:

1st Accused- 3rd count-1-year rigorous imprisonment suspended for

15 years with a fine of Rs.10,000/ and with a

default sentence of 12 months. Rs.50,000/-

compensation with a default sentence of 12

months simple imprisonment.

4th count-1-year rigorous imprisonment suspended for

15 years with a fine of Rs.5000/ with a

default sentence of 03 months simple

imprisonment. Rs.25,000/- compensation

with a default sentence of 9 months simple

imprisonment.

1st Appellant (2nd Accused)- 1st count- death sentence.

2nd count- 1- year rigorous imprisonment

with a fine of Rs.10,000/- default

sentence and with a default sentence of

03 months simple imprisonment.

CA/HCC/0260/20

2nd Appellant (3rd Accused)- 1st count- death sentence.

3rd count- 1- year rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of

Rs.10,000/- and with a default

sentence of 03 months simple

imprisonment.

Rs.100,000/- compensation with a

default sentence of 12 months simple

imprisonment.

4th count- 2- years rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10,000/

and with a default sentence of 03

months simple imprisonment.

Rs.50,000/- compensation with a

default sentence of 09 months simple

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence. At the

time of argument, the Appellants were connected via zoom from prison.

Background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

In this case, it is quite significant that the incident had transpired between

two families. PW1 is the sister and PW5 is the brother-in-law of the deceased.

PW3 and PW4 are the parents of the deceased.

CA/HCC/0260/20

6 | P a g e

The 1st Appellant is the father of the 1st and 4th Accused. The 2nd Appellant

is the son-in-law of the 1st Appellant who had married the daughter of 1st

Appellant.

The evidence revealed that a dispute had subsisted between the deceased

and the 1st Accused for a long time beginning from their young ages and the

same prolonged dispute had been the cause of the incident which culminated

in the murder of the deceased.

According to PW1, the deceased is her brother who was a soldier in the Sri

Lankan Army at the time of his demise. During the time of the incident the

deceased had returned home on holiday.

According to PW1, she was at home when she heard a man screaming. When

she rushed to the place, she had seen the deceased standing on the road in

front of the house of the 1st Appellants daughter. At that time, she had seen

the 1st and 2nd Appellants attacking the deceased with a sword and a knife.

When her father PW4 came to the place of incident to rescue his son, the 2nd

Appellant had attacked him with sword. At that moment, the 1st Accused

had hit her on the head with a pole.

According to PW4, his wife PW6 was cut by the 1st Appellant and his son-in-

law PW5 was attacked by the 2nd Appellant with a sword. PW6 had died

before she could give evidence in the High Court. Hence, her evidence was

marked under Section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance by the prosecution.

According to the 1st Appellant who gave evidence from the witness box, , the

deceased, along with PW1, PW4, PW6 and PW5 had arrived at his daughters

house and attacked the 1st Appellant, his daughter and his granddaughter

prior to the incident. The 1st Appellants daughter Palika, DW3 had given

evidence and the Medico Legal Reports of the 1st Appellant and DW3 were

marked as V16 and V17. The B/Report filed by the police confirmed that the

1st Appellant had received injuries from the incident.

CA/HCC/0260/20

7 | P a g e

The Appellants adduced following grounds of appeal.

1. There is no adequate consideration of the facts of the case.

2. The Common Intention was not considered in the judgment of the

learned trial judge.

3. According to the facts of the case, evidence transpired of provocation

but no consideration given in the judgment. Thereby the Appellants

were deprived of a fair trial.

The learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the 2nd Appellant

strenuously argued that this is a fit and proper case to be considered under

Section 297 of the Penal Code on the basis of provocation and sudden fight.

This was endorsed by the Counsel for the 1st Appellant as well.

Before the commencement of the trial, the Counsel for all the Accused

informed the Court that his clients were willing to tender a plea under 297

of the Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight but this was not agreed to

by the prosecution.

Hence, I consider it is pertinent to consider the 3rd ground of appeal first

before considering the 1st and 2nd grounds of appeal.

The exception 4 to Section 294 (Murder) of the Penal Code states as

follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation: - It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the

provocation or commits the first assault.

CA/HCC/0260/20

As stated above, the involved parties are two families. A long-standing

dispute had existed between the deceased and the 1st Accused who is the

son of the 1st Appellant.

It is not disputed that the incident had happened in very close proximity to

the house of DW3, Palika the daughter of the 1st Appellant. Although during

her statement as a witness, PW1 had stated that the 1st Appellant had turned

the deceased who was lying fallen upwards, pulled a knife from his waist and

stabbed the deceased in the chest area, this was not mentioned to police

when she gave her statement. Further, she admitted that she did not

mention that the 1st Appellant used a knife to stab the deceased. This was

highlighted as an omission.

Further, a vital contradiction was marked in the evidence given by PW3. In

her statement, she had stated that they had a fight prior to the incident

pertaining to this case. But she had denied this when she was cross

examined. This contradiction was marked as V6.

PW4 the father of PW1 had stated to the police that when he came to the

place of incident, his son had fallen down and his daughter was at home,

but during the trial, he had stated that the deceased was standing. This

contradiction was marked as V11.

PW5, the husband of PW1 stated about a fight when he was suggested that

the incident had happened inside the house of the 1st Appellants daughter.

The 1st Appellant who gave evidence from the witness box stated that he had

no alternative but to attack the deceased and his party at his daughters

house to save his life and the life of his daughter DW3 Palika. They had

entered the house of DW3 with a katty and an axe and behaved in an abusive

manner. After hitting the 1st Appellant on his head, the deceased and his

crowd had damaged the television and cabinet. Thereafter, his daughter was

attacked. Initially, the 1st Appellant had used a knife which he used to cut

CA/HCC/0260/20

9 | P a g e

arecanut in order to save his and his daughters life. Having told the daughter

to run away with her child, the 1st Appellant had left through the rear door

and had come back with a mamoty at which time the deceased had attacked

him with a sword. In order to save himself, first he had dealt a blow on the

hand of the deceased. As a result, the sword had fallen on to the ground.

Quickly, he had picked up the sword and attacked the mob around him. At

that point somebody had dealt him a blow on his hand and sword had fallen

down again. Thereafter, he had picked up a pole from the fence and attacked

the mob to disperse them. The B/Report filed by the police confirmed that

the 1st Appellant has sustained injuries in the incident.

It is very pertinent to note that the prosecution had failed to produce

recovered productions during the trial.

DW3, Palika also corroborated his evidence and she had added that in the

morning of the incident the deceased walking past her house repeatedly for

three times had shouted that he would kill her father that day. Further when

she was at the public well, the deceased had come there and reiterated that

he would kill her father.

The Defence called a lawyer who had visited the scene of crime as an Acting

Magistrate who had visited the crime scene noted the damage caused to the

television and the cabinet in the house of DW3. He? had also noted several

blood marks in the house of DW3.

Both the Counsels of the Appellants contended that the learned High Court

Judge had relied on the opinion given by the investigating officer regarding

the happening of the incident inside the house citing it was a rainy day and

could reasonably expect mud patches to be there inside the house. But the

B/Report filed by the police had stated that there was no rain. They further

contended that it has caused great prejudice as the learned High Court

Judge believing the opinion of the police officer had come to the conclusion

that there had not been a struggle inside DW3s residence.

CA/HCC/0260/20

10 | P a g e

According to PW1 the distance between their ancestral house and the place

of incident is about 1.5 Km. The prosecution had not elicited any evidence

as to why the deceased and the prosecution witnesses had gone to such a

distance and sustained injuries.

In this case the learned High Court Judge had failed to take into

consideration the fact that the prosecution witnesses had failed to explain

the injuries caused to the 1st Appellant and the defence witness DW3.

Lakshmi Singh And Other v State of Bihar 1976 AIR SC 2263 the Indian

Supreme Court held that:

The facts of the present case clearly fall within the four corners of either

of the first two principles laid down by this judgment. In the instant case,

either the accused were fully justified in causing the death of the deceased

and were protected by the right of private defence or that if the prosecution

does not explain the injuries on the person of the deceased the entire

prosecution case is doubtful and the genesis of the occurrence is shrouded

in deep mystery, which is sufficient to demolish the entire prosecution

case. It seems to us that in a murder case, the non-explanation of the

injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of the occurrence or in

the course of altercation is a very important circumstance from which the

Court can draw the following inferences:

(1) That the prosecution has sup- pressed the genesis and the origin of the

occurrence and has thus not presented the true version:

(2) that the witnesses who have denied the presence of the injuries on the

person of the accused are lying on a most material point and therefore their

evidence is unreliable;

CA/HCC/0260/20

11 | P a g e

(3) that in case there is a defence version which explains the injuries on

the person of the accused it is rendered probable so as to throw doubt on

the prosecution case.

The omission on the part of the prosecution to explain the injuries on the

person of the accused assumes much greater importance where the

evidence consists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence

gives a version which competes in probability with that of the prosecution

case.

During the trial the Medico Legal Report of the 1st Appellant and the DW3

were marked as V16 and V17 and the prosecution had admitted the said

reports.

Considering the evidence presented by both parties, ample evidence surfaced

about a sudden fight, provocation and exceeding the right of self-defence.

But this had completely escaped the consideration of the learned High Court

Judge.

As pointed out above, the incident had happened close to the house of DW3

and the 1st Appellant. According to PW1, the place of incident is about 1.5

Km from their house. Hence, the reason for going to the place of incident by

the deceased and prosecution witnesses were not explained. Although the

prosecution witnesses stated that the 1st Appellant sat on the deceaseds

body and stabbed him, this was marked as an omission at the trial. The 1st

Appellant admitted that he attacked the deceased using a small knife and a

sword brought by the deceased to attack him and his daughter DW3. The

injuries sustained by the deceased, the prosecution witnesses and the 1st

Appellant and his daughter had been placed before the trial.

CA/HCC/0260/20

12 | P a g e

Section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance states;

When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the

existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general

exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso

contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the

offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such

circumstances.

The evidence clearly shows that the deceaseds party had inflicted injuries

on the 1st Appellant and his daughter which had resulted in provoking him.

Being provoked he had exercised his right to private defence but exceeded

the limits when he inflicted injuries. Therefore, this case should have been

considered under Section 297 of the Penal Code instead of 296 of the Penal

Code. Thus, the third ground jointly raised by the Appellants has merit.

As the third ground of appeal substantially affects the outcome of the case,

the first and second grounds of appeal will not be considered in this appeal.

Hence, considering all the circumstances of this case, I set aside the

conviction and the sentence imposed on the Appellants in terms of Section

296 of the Penal Code under count one. I find the Appellants guilty for

culpable homicide not amounting to murder under 1st limb of Section 297 of

the Penal Code and sentence them to 12 years rigorous imprisonment on the

first count.

Further, the conviction and the sentence imposed on count two against the

1st Appellant and count three and count four against the 2nd Appellant to are

to remain the same.

I further order that the sentences imposed on count one and count two

against the 1st Appellant to run concurrent to each other. Similarly, I order

CA/HCC/0260/20

13 | P a g e

the sentences imposed on count one, count three and count four against the

2nd Appellant to run concurrent to each other.

As the Appellants are in prison since the date of conviction by the learned

High Court Judge, I order the sentence imposed be operative from the date

of conviction namely, 29/09/2020.

Subject to the above variation the appeal is partly allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send the judgment to the High Court

of Balapitiya along with the original case record.
