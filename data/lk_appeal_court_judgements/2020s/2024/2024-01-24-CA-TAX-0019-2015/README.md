Before: Sobhitha Rajakaruna J. Dhammika Ganepola J. Counsel: Chaya Sri Nammuni DSG for the Appellant Dr.Shivaji Felix with Nivantha Satharasinghe for the Respondent Argued on: 02.10.2023 Written Submissions- Appellant - 28.08.2019 Respondent - 18.06.2018,13.05.2020, 27.11.2023 Decided on: 24.01.2024

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

In terms of section 11A (2) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No 23 of 2011, the Appellant

tendered to this Court by way of a motion dated 14.12.2015 the Case Stated and annexures

thereto marked X1 to X4.

The Respondent - Osprey Clothing (Private) Limited (Company) entered into an agreement

(1st Agreement) with the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) on 10.06.1992 to set up

CA/TAX/0019/2015 Tax Appeals Commission TAC/OLD/IT/044

Page 2 of 7

and operate a business of manufacturing and exporting apparel at Kantale. The Period for

which the tax exemption was granted to the Respondent under the said Agreement is 15 years

from the year of assessment. Subsequently, on 25.05.1993 another Agreement

(Supplementary Agreement) was entered into between both the above parties. In view of the

said Supplementary Agreement the Respondent sought approval from the BOI for the

establishment of a washing plant, finishing section and bounded warehouse in Nawagamuwa,

in addition to the business referred to in the 1st Agreement.

The core issue that needs to be resolved in the instant Application is whether the Respondent

is entitled for tax relief under BOI law in respect of the said washing plant, finishing section

and bounded warehouse established in Nawagamuwa. The Tax Appeals Commission (TAC)

based on the contents of Clause 10 of the 1st Agreement decided that the Tax exemption

granted in favor of the Respondent applies even to the business activities relating to the

washing plant etc.

The following questions were raised before the TAC by the Appellant for the opinion of this

Court:

1. "Whether the Tax Appeals Commission disregarded the term said business

and entitlement of exemption in the principal Agreement dated 10th June 1992

2. Whether the Tax Appeals Commission has erred in the determination, the

recital of the principal Agreement was amended so as to take the newly

introduced business under the reference of the said business.

3. Whether the Tax Appeals Commission has erred in law to determine the scope

of which the tax exemption granted under the principal Agreement of BOI and

the Supplementary Agreement

4. Whether the Tax Appeal Commission has erred by disregarding the restriction

clauses 5(d) and 5(e) in the principal Agreement." (Vide 'Case Stated' dated

02.12.2015)

The stand taken by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue before the TAC was that

the tax exemption granted for 15 years under Clause 10 of the aforesaid 1st Agreement, does

not cover the whole profit and income of the Company but it is limited to the profit and

Page 3 of 7

income from manufacturing and exporting apparels which is the business described in the

said 1st Agreement. The alleged basis for such an argument is that the business referred to in

the Supplementary Agreement is different from the business declared in the 1st Agreement.

Clause 5 of the said Supplementary Agreement declares that the said Agreement is

supplemental to the aforesaid 1st Agreement of which certain Clauses have been modified. On

perusal of the said Supplementary Agreement, it implies that the respective parties have

entered into the said Agreement based on the conditions and stipulations contained in the

letter dated 04.03.1993 signed by the Director General of BOI (page 304 of the Brief). The

approval to set up an enterprise establishing a washing plant, finishing section and bounded

warehouse has been approved by the BOI through the said letter. The said letter of approval,

among several other conditions stipulates that all income of the enterprise should be received

in convertible foreign currency. The said Supplementary Agreement was authenticated by

the parties following the said letter of the BOI and both parties arrived at a mutual agreement

in respect of all its Clauses.

It is noted that the Supplementary Agreement consists of just 5 clauses, all of which are

intended to amend the said 1st Agreement. By its 1st Clause, a new paragraph has been

inserted immediately after the recital of the 1st Agreement and the granting of approval of the

establishment of the said washing plant, etc., is displayed therein. The 2nd Clause of the said

Supplementary Agreement is to replace Clause 1 of the 1st Agreement with the following

Clause:

Clause (1) of the said Agreement is hereby deleted and the following new clause (1) is hereby

stipulated therefor-

(1) The Enterprise shall be entitled to and shall set up/conduct and operate the said business

at Kantalai in the Eastern Province and washing Plant, finishing section and bounded

warehouse at Low Level Road, Nawagamuwa subject to the terms and conditions set out

in the Boards letter of 04th March 1993 shall be in accordance with the undertakings,

representations, commitments and proposals made by the Enterprise and set out in the

said application and all correspondence connected therewith and included those

enumerated in the Second Schedule of the said Agreement and in the Schedule hereto

Page 4 of 7

and subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter provided and subject to the provisions

of the said Law No. 4 of 1978 and any amendments thereto and other rules and statutory

regulations as may be applicable thereto.

The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue has raised in argument before the TAC that

the literal meaning of Clause 10 of the 1st Agreement, by which the tax exemption has been

granted, suggests that the following three requisites need to be fulfilled to fall under the

category of the said business which includes washing plant etc., in order to be entitled to tax

exemption (Vide- page 226 of the Brief) -

01. The business should be of manufacturing and exporting apparels.

02.The products should be exported totally and exported in the name of enterprise

03. The business should be carried on in Kantalai Eastern Province.

Further, referring to Clause 5(d) and 5(e) of the 1st Agreement, the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue argues that no sub-contract work can be carried out without prior approval

of the BOI. There is no doubt that by the said Supplementary Agreement only one Clause

and the recital of the 1st Agreement have been amended.

After a careful examination of the Clauses of both the 1st Agreement and the Supplementary

Agreement, I take the view that the said 1st Agreement has been amended only to a certain

extent by the Supplementary Agreement and all the Clauses which were not amended remain

fully enforceable and binding on the parties along with the above-mentioned amended

Clauses thereto. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that the Supplementary Agreement has

permitted the Company to carry out sales within Sri Lanka in respect of the washing plant

etc., and it is merely because Clause 5 of the 1st Agreement has not been amended at all.

According to Clause 5(e) of the 1st Agreement what is restricted is to engage in subcontract

work by the Company and as such it is a misconception that the Company cannot expand its

business as a result of the provisions of the said Clause 5(e).

A primary agreement can be assumed as the primary source of legal rights and the obligations

of the relevant parties. The supplemental agreement usually derives its legal effect from the

primary agreement. The modifying, extending or clarifying of the terms of the primary

Page 5 of 7

agreement by a supplementary agreement is usually done with the express consent of the

parties. The types of Supplementary Agreements can be considered amendments,

addendums, side letters, waivers and riders. The principle of Novation cannot be invoked as

a defense when expressed consent of all parties exists upon all the conditions of a

supplementary agreement. As far as the terms agreed upon by the parties in the primary

agreement and the supplementary agreement are lawful such agreements should be

considered valid contracts. In the instant case the Appellant does not even raise any objection

on the legality of both the 1st and the 2nd agreements but what he attempts to do is to give an

interpretation on whether tax exemption is applied to the "business" which includes washing

plants etc.

I cannot find any lawful reason to accept the arguments of the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue that the tax exemption granted to the Company does not apply to the profits

and income of the business enhanced under the Supplementary Agreement. I take this view

especially because I am not convinced that inserting a new recital has not made any effect on

the provisions of the tax exemption clause (Clause 10) and also due to the reason that the BOI

has expressly permitted the enhancement of business of the Company under the basic terms

and conditions contained in the 1st Agreement. The Company contends that he said washing

plant etc., is not an extension of their garment factory but a separate business. When

considering the overall circumstances of this case I take the view that the provisions of the

Supplementary Agreement have not exerted any influence on the said Clause 10 of the 1st

Agreement.

At this juncture I need to take into account the letter dated 09.06.2006 addressed to the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue by the BOI (at page 279 of the Brief). According

to the said communication the BOI has categorically confirmed that the establishment of a

washing plant, finishing section and bounded warehouse at Low Level Road, Nawagamuwa

by the Company, has been approved by the BOI on 04.03.1993 and it forms part and parcel

of the business of the Company (Osprey Clothing (Private) Limited). The BOI has written

the above letter referring to a letter dated 06.06.2006 (at page 280 of the Brief) by which the

Company has disclosed that two additional activities (washing plant and finishing section)

also comprises of the main business activities of the Company and do not conform to any sub-

Page 6 of 7

contract work. In the meantime, it is important to draw my attention to the Application for

approval of an investment dated 19.11.1992 (at page 311a of the Brief) in which the Company

has expressed its intention to establish the washing plant etc. According to the said

Application such intention has been described as follows:

The annual quantities of washing from Maldives will be approximately 80,000 dozens. This

quantities will have to be finished in our factory and exported from Sri Lanka. For this purpose

we will have to set up a finishing unit in the same premise to undertake certain sewing operations

(Button attaching, Bartacking), ironing operation and export packing.

This Court in Ace Healthcare (Pvt) Ltd v. Major General (Retired) Vijitha Ravipriya, Director

General of Customs and Others CA/WRIT/171/2022 decided on 30.05.2023 referring to the BOI

Agreement relevant to the said case observed that several Clauses of the agreement tend to

provide that all taxes and levies in respect of importation of items other than the Customs

duties are payable based on the applicability. Further the Court has decided in the said case

that the CESS is a levy distinct to the Customs duties referred to in section 10 of the Customs

Ordinance and further an appropriate branch of the Government must have the authority to

inquire into related goods which are imported against the terms of a BOI Agreement.

However, in light of the above reasons I hold that the Company is not liable to pay tax as per

the assessment made for the taxable period 2003/2004.

In Ceylon Quartz Industries (Private) Limited vs. The Director General of Customs, S.C. Appeal

No. 79/2002 decided on 04.10.2012. Dr. Shirani A. Bandaranayake CJ. has stated;

As referred to earlier BOI was introduced and established chiefly for the purpose of attracting

investments within the country. With the said objective in mind various concessions were offered

for the investors. In this process the BOI was introduced as a One Stop Shop mainly to indicate

that there will not be any unnecessary hazzles in carrying out their business by the investors. This

position is clearly demonstrated by Clause 10 of the Agreement, which lists out the benefits,

exemptions and/or privileges that are granted to the Enterprises in connection with the relevant

businesses. In that, Sub Clause (ix), referred to earlier, clearly stated that, all goods, articles,

manufactured and/or produced by the Enterprises may be exported outside Sri Lanka free of

export duty and more importantly, any custom or export control. The said Clause 10 (ix) also

Page 7 of 7

states that, the said goods produced by the Enterprises should be in accordance with the

agreements entered into by the said Enterprise with the BOI.

The powers of the BOI in relation to entering into agreements with any enterprise is stipulated

in section 17 of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law. In terms of section 17(2) every

such agreement shall be reduced to writing and shall upon registration with the BOI,

constitute a valid and binding contract between the BOI and the Enterprise. However, the

said Law does not expressly indicate any restriction of BOI including two distinct businesses

of an Enterprise in the same agreement. In the instant Application it is noted that the BOI

was inclined to include the Companys apparel business and the business in relation to the

washing plant etc., in the 1st Agreement by introducing amendments through the said

Supplementary Agreement.

In these circumstances, I answer the questions raised, before the TAC, for the opinion of this

Court, in the negative form as follows:

Question 1 : No

Question 2 : No

Question 3 : No

Question 4 : No

For the reasons given above, I affirm the determination made by the TAC dated 22.10.2015.

The Registrar is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment to the TAC.
