The total contract value up to the date of practical completion had been Rs. 56,721,032.22, including Rs.17,127,310.45 of the cost of escalations. The Petitioner states that there had been a dispute between the Petitioner and DNA regarding obtaining a balance payment of the above contract value. The Petitioner had appealed to the Ombudsman in respect of the above dispute. Thereafter, the Ombudsman had determined [P4] that Rs. 55,755,656.14 as the amount that should be paid to the contractor and Rs. 22,403,884.79 as the remaining balance payment due to the Petitioners Company out of the said amount of Rs.55,755,656.14. Further, the Ombudsman recommended that said outstanding balance to be settled upon completion of the structural adjustments and the maintenance works as agreed by the parties. Rs. 600,000 out of the Rs. 1.2 million which was the estimated cost of the above maintenance by the Director of the National Archives was to be met by the Contractor. The Petitioner states that the contractor satisfactorily completed the restoration works of the building putting its share as agreed and requested the settlement of the outstanding amount of Rs.22,403,884.79 as per the decision of the Ombudsman. It is submitted that although the Director of National Archives paid the Contractor in full with respect to the restoration contract, the outstanding amount of Rs.22,403,884.79 as per the decision of the Ombudsman was defaulted.",

In Dr. Puvanendran and another v Premasiri and two others 2009 (2) Sri. L.R. 107 it was held that the Court will issue a writ only if the major facts are not in dispute and the legal result of the facts are not subject to controversy. Further, it is observed that any balance payment if any as claimed by the Petitioner could be made only after considering the recommendations of the appointed Committee who exercised its discretion. In Abeyratne v Minister of Lands and Others S.C. (Spl)LA No. 197/08 SC Minutes: 01.06.2009, Sarath N. Silva C.J., emphasizing the clear distinction between the two remedies of Certiorari and Mandamus quoted the excerpts from Administrative Law by Wade and Forsyth (Ninth Edition) and pronounced that, obligatory duties must be distinguished from discretionary powers. With the latter, Mandamus has nothing to do. His Lordship Chief Justice reiterated that Mandamus has nothing to do with the exercise of discretionary power. The Cabinet arrived at its decision on 03.03.2010 based on Document P18B which is intact. Furthermore, it is observed that the Petitioner has sought to quash only the decision reflected in P46 but not the respective recommendations made in Document P18B or the said Cabinet Decision. Hence, any order to be delivered to quash the said decision in P46 would not have any effect on the existing recommendations in P18B. The Petitioner has failed to establish any legal right to make any balance payment. A Writ of Mandamus cannot be sought to enforce a right not of a legal basis but of a purely equitable matter as the function of the Writ of Mandamus is to compel a public authority to do its duty. [see, Amarasekera v. Hon. Nimal Siripala de Silva and 4 others 2010[B.L.R.] 54]. At the same instant, even if the Petitioner's application for a Writ of Certiorari is granted, he is not entitled to claim balance payment as the decision in P18B exists. Therefore, issuing a Writ of Mandamus as prayed would be futile. A Writ of Mandamus will not be issued if it will be futile to do so and no purpose will be served.",
