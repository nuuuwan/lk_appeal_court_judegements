WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Gampaha on

four counts for committing the Murder of four persons on or about

01.02.2002, by setting fire to the victims home, which in turn caused

their deaths an offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

As the accused-appellant was absconding, evidence was led under

Section 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the trial

proceeded. However, throughout the trial, the accused-appellant was

represented by an Attorney-at-Law, and all the prosecution witnesses

were cross-examined. After the prosecution case, the learned judge called

for a defence but no witnesses were called on behalf of the accused-

appellant. After the trial, the learned high court judge convicted the

appellant on all four counts and sentenced him to death. This appeal is

preferred against the said conviction and sentence.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions had been filed on behalf of both

parties. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the

appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent

Page 3 of 14

made oral submissions. On the request of the learned Counsel for the

appellant, further written submissions were filed after the hearing.

In brief, the prosecution case is as follows:

PW-1, an 11-year-old boy at the time of the incident, was living in

Enderamulla with his parents and two younger siblings. He was 19 years

old at the time he testified. The accused-appellant, according to PW-1,

was a neighbour of PW-1 who was about 25 years old at the time of the

incident. The accused-appellant used to play with PW-1, and it

transpires from the evidence of PW-1 that he had been sexually abusing

PW-1 for some time prior to the incident. The accused-appellant had

invited PW-1 to live with him in his house, but he declined. Upon denial

by PW-1, he set fire to the house where the family of PW-1 resided. As a

result, the mother, father, younger brother, and younger sister of PW-1,

who were sleeping on the same bed, died.

Before the day of the incident, the accused-appellant had suggested

several times to PW-1 to set fire to the house of PW-1 and kill PW-1s

family members, enabling PW-1 to live with the accused-appellant in his

house. On the day before the incident, the accused-appellant had gone to

visit a doctor together with PW-1, obtained a prescription, and thereafter

purchased sleeping tablets in the presence of PW-1. On that day, the

accused-appellant had also purchased petrol, informing his intention to

set fire to the house. According to PW-1, the night before the incident,

the accused-appellant had added sleeping pills to the food prepared for

PW-1's family for dinner. On the following day, around 3.00 a.m.,

the accused-appellant entered PW-1's house, asked PW-1 to leave, and

entered the house holding a bucket. Shortly after, PW-1 has seen fire

inside his house, and the accused-appellant came back from the house,

running towards PW-1.

The learned counsel for the appellant advanced his arguments on the

following grounds:

i. The learned high court judge erred in law by applying Section

76 of the Penal Code when arriving at a decision with regard to

the culpability of PW-1 which is not permissible in law.

ii. The learned high court judge erred in law by arriving at a

finding that PW-1 is not an accomplice and his evidence need

not be corroborated.

iii. The evidence of PW-1 is not credible in light of the contradictory

nature of his evidence.

iv. The learned high court judge has failed to consider that there is

no conditional pardon given to PW-1 in terms of Section 256 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

v. The learned trial judge has failed to consider the integrity and

credibility of investigations.

The key point raised by the learned counsel for the appellant was that

the learned high court judge had wrongly applied Section 76 of the Penal

Code to the prosecution witness number one, who was the only witness

who spoke about the incident and then the learned judge acted upon his

evidence. The learned counsel contended that the finding of the learned

judge that PW-1 is not an accomplice is wrong, PW-1 is an accomplice

and to accept his evidence, the honourable Attorney General should

tender a pardon to him in terms of Section 256 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act. The learned counsel contended further that without

corroborative evidence, the learned judge could not act upon PW-1s

evidence as he was an accomplice. The learned Counsel submitted the

judgments Dissanayake Mudiyanselage Jayasiri V. The Hon. Attorney

General S.C. Appeal 73/2015, decided on 18.09.2018; Panangalage

Don Nilanka and another V. The Hon. Attorney General S.C. Appeal No.

139/2014, decided on 21.11.2018 and Ajith Fernando alias Konda Ajith

Page 5 of 14

and others V. The Attorney General (2004) 1 Sri. L.R. 288 in

substantiating his arguments.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent stated that PW-1

was a 11-year-old boy at the time of the incident and he is not an

accomplice. Thus, she contended that the question of tendering a pardon

by the Attorney General does not arise. Further, she contended that the

learned high court judge is correct in acting upon PW-1s evidence, as he

is a credible witness. The learned DSG stated that PW-1 gave evidence

regarding the main incident, but medical evidence and the evidence of

other witnesses corroborates PW-1s evidence regarding the other

matters relating to the main incident.

The learned DSG pointed out that PW-1 had been sexually abused by the

accused-appellant continuously. She explained that PW-1 was compelled

to do all the acts that he did with the accused-appellant because the

appellant had taken control of this 11-year-old boy. Because of PW-1s

fear of the appellant, the learned DSG stated that PW-1 had to obey

everything that the appellant said. Therefore, she contended that PW-1 is

a victim and a witness but certainly not an accomplice. In addition, the

learned DSG pointed out that the contradictions marked on behalf of the

appellant were minor contradictions and they do not affect the credibility

of PW-1. She contended that the learned high court judge has correctly

evaluated the evidence of the case and has come to a correct conclusion.

The aforesaid 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th grounds of appeal are interconnected. I

wish to consider first, the aforesaid 5th ground of failing to consider the

credibility and integrity of the investigations. The learned counsel for the

appellant pointed out that a flambeau was found at the scene of the

crime and the investigators wanted to bring the said flambeau within

Section 27(1) as that was recovered according to the statement made by

Page 6 of 14

the accused-appellant. Accordingly, the learned trial judge gave a date to

consider it. The learned counsel submitted that on the next date, the

investigator said that he had collected the said torch at the crime scene

around 4.20 a.m. when he had visited the place. The learned counsel for

the appellant contended that this evidence clearly stipulates the fact that

the police were trying to implicate the accused-appellant with some

fabricated evidence.

The impact of error, illegality or defect in the investigation has been

considered in the following judgments.

In Union of India vs. Prakash P. Hinduja - AIR 2003 SC 2612 the

Supreme Court of India observed; in H.N. Rishbud v. The State of Delhi

1955 SCR 1150, Court held that if cognizance is in fact taken on a police

report initiated by the breach of a mandatory provision relating to

investigation, there can be no doubt that the result of the trial, which

follows it cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can

be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice and that an

illegality committed in the course of investigation does not affect the

competence and the jurisdiction of the Court for trial. Hence, it is

apparent that even an illegal investigation does not affect the competence

and the jurisdiction of the Court if a miscarriage of justice has not been

occurred due to the said illegality.

In Amar Singh vs. Balwinder Singh - AIR 2003 SC 1164, it was held

that where the prosecution case is fully established by the direct

testimony of the eye-witnesses, which is corroborated by the medical

evidence, any failure or omission of the investigating officer cannot

render the prosecution case doubtful or unworthy of belief. In the

instant action also, the prosecution case is mainly relied on the

testimony of PW-1 who was at the scene when setting fire to the house.

Page 7 of 14

In the case at hand, the learned counsel for the appellant contended that

the investigator attempted to implicate the accused-appellant by stating

in his evidence that the flambeau was recovered based on the statement

made by the accused-appellant. However, the learned high court judge,

in his judgment, had never considered any connection between the

flambeau and the accused-appellant. The learned judge made all of his

observations on the basis that the investigator had collected the said

flambeau at the crime scene. Hence, no prejudice has been caused to the

appellant as a result of the alleged bias of the investigator demonstrated

by the learned counsel for the appellant. Therefore, I hold that the issue

pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant in respect of the

integrity and credibility of investigations has no effect in determining this

action.

Now, I proceed to consider the main issue raised by the learned counsel

for the appellant. The main issue is outlined in the aforementioned

grounds of appeal 1, 2, 3, and 4. The learned counsel who appeared for

the accused in the high court trial had made submissions at the

conclusion of the trial that only the evidence of an accomplice is before

the Court and that his evidence cannot be acted upon without

corroboration.

The learned high court judge has dealt with that issue in paragraphs 41,

42, 43 and 44 of his judgment. The learned trial judge found with

reasons that the 11-year-old PW-1 had not attained sufficient maturity to

understand the nature and consequence of his conduct when doing

certain things with the accused-appellant in relation to the offence

described in the indictment when the appellant told him to do those

things. Accordingly, the learned judge applied Section 76 of the Penal

Code and stated in his judgment that PW-1 could not commit an offence

Page 8 of 14

according to Section 76 of the Penal Code and thus he does not fall into

the category of an accomplice. It was the view of the learned trial judge

that corroboration is not required to act upon PW-1s evidence if the said

evidence is found to be credible.

One of the arguments of the learned counsel for the appellant was that it

has not been proved by presenting the birth certificate or any other

acceptable evidence that PW-1 was under twelve years at the time of the

incident. The learned counsel pointed out that as appears on Page 95 of

the appeal brief, PW-1 has stated that his age is about eleven years.

However, in the examination in chief, when PW-1 was questioned about

his age in the year 2002 (at Page 82 of the Appeal Brief), he clearly stated

that his age was eleven years. In addition, when PW-1 was giving a

statement to the Police on 02nd February 2002, he stated that his age is

eleven years. The age of PW-1 was never in dispute. Therefore, it is

apparent that PW-1 was under the age of twelve years at the time of the

incident and further proof of his age is not warranted.

Apart from that, the learned counsel for the appellant stressed the point

that Section 76 of the Penal Code does not apply to a prosecution witness

and it applies only to an accused in formulating his defence. The learned

DSG contended that PW-1 is not an accomplice because he was not

directly or indirectly involved in committing the offence.

According to my view, Section 76 of the Penal Code applies to PW-1 in

the following way. In that respect, it is necessary to consider what this

section means. Section 76 of the Penal Code reads as follows:

Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above eight years of age

and under twelve, who has not attained sufficient maturity of

Page 9 of 14

understanding to judge of the nature and consequence of his conduct on

that occasion.

According to Section 76, anything done by a child above eight years and

under 12 years of age who is unable to understand the nature and

consequence of his conduct at the time he or she is doing that act, is not

an offence. As stated previously, the learned trial judge has found that

PW-1 had not attained sufficient maturity to understand the nature and

consequences of his acts when doing certain things with the accused-

appellant on his demand.

When considering whether PW-1 had attained sufficient maturity to

understand the nature and consequence of his conduct, it must be noted

that the minor age of the child could be the only reason for a child to not

to have attained sufficient maturity. However, the minor age is not the

only reason for PW-1 to not understand the nature and consequences of

the acts that he did with the appellant. PW-1 is not only under twelve

years of age but also a victim of continuing grave sexual abuse. The

evidence confirms that he was a child who had to obey the abuser (the

accused-appellant) and do things as the accused-appellant said mainly

because of the fear. PW-1 has stated in his evidence that the accused-

appellant threatened him that he would be killed if he says something

about setting fire to the house to anybody (page 93 of the Appeal Brief).

Because of the fear, PW-1 stated that he had to obey the accused-

appellant. In view of the aforesaid factors, it is evident that PW-1 had not

acted with the intention to commit a crime. It is apparent from the

evidence adduced in the high court that PW-1 was compelled to do what

the accused-appellant told him to do. The eleven-year-old boy was not in

a position to refuse to do what the appellant directed him to do. Under

these circumstances, I agree with the finding of the learned high court

judge that PW-1 was not mature enough to understand the nature and

Page 10 of 14

consequences of his conduct when he did certain things directed by the

appellant.

Now, it is important to consider who is an accomplice. In the case of

King V. Pieris Appuhamy 43 NLR 412, the interpretation given to

Accomplice in the Indian case of Rekumal V. Emperor 1934 AIR 183 is

cited as follows: An accomplice is a person directly or indirectly involved

in the commission of a criminal offence.

As PW-1 was not mature enough to understand the nature and

consequence of his conduct, anything done by PW-1 is not an offence

according to Section 76 of the Penal Code. Therefore, directly or

indirectly PW-1 could not be involved in commission of a criminal offence

and thus, he is not an accomplice. Accordingly, the decision of the

learned judge that PW-1 is not an accomplice is correct. In the

circumstances, the issue of tendering a pardon by the Attorney General

would not arise. PW-1 is also an ordinary witness and the learned high

court judge has correctly decided that PW-1s evidence need not be

corroborated to be acted upon his evidence.

At this stage, it is also vital to consider the Amendment No.10 of 2018

brought to the Penal Code, although the said amendment is not

applicable to the instant case. By the said amendment, Section 75 of the

Penal Code has been amended as follows:

Section 75 of the Penal Code (Chapter 19) (hereinafter referred to as the

"principal enactment") is hereby amended by the substitution -

(1) for the words "eight years" of the words "twelve years"; and

(2) in the marginal note thereof, for the words "eight years", of the

words "twelve years".

Page 11 of 14

Section 76 has been amended as follows:

Section 76 of the principal enactment is hereby amended by the

substitution

(1) for the words "above eight years of age and under twelve," of the

words "above twelve years of age and under fourteen"; and

(2) in the marginal note thereof, for the words "above eight and

under twelve" of the words "above twelve and under fourteen".

When making submissions, the learned counsel for the appellant pointed

out citing the judgment of Panangalage Don Nilanka and another V. The

Hon. Attorney General S.C. Appeal No. 139/2014, decided on

21.11.2018 that under Section 75 of the Penal Code, a child under the

age of 8 years has absolute protection from culpable liability and under

Section 76, a child between 8 and 12 years of age has qualified

protection from criminal liability. According to the amendment No. 10 of

2018 brought to the Penal Code, a child under 12 years has absolute

protection from culpable liability. Although this amendment could not be

applied to the case at hand, the intention of the legislature is clear. The

amendment was introduced in 2018, as the legislature deemed it

prudent to legislate that anything done by a child below the age of 12

years should not be considered an offence. Although the amendment

could not be applied to the instant case, the intention behind this

amendment can be taken into consideration. This helps to substantiate

the finding of the learned high court judge that PW-1, who was at the age

of 11 years had not attain sufficient maturity to understand the nature

and consequences of his conduct on the incidents relating to this case.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General argued, even if the age of the child

is disregarded, PW-1 is not an accomplice and he is a victim and a

witness. At this stage, it is pertinent to consider more elaborately who

can be considered as an accomplice. In Peiris V. Dole 49 NLR 142 at

Page 12 of 14

page 143, Basnayake, CJ. made the following observations: An

accomplice is one who is a guilty associate in crime or who sustains such

relation to the criminal act that he could be charged jointly with the

accused. It is admittedly, not every participation in a crime which makes

a party an accomplice in it so as to require his testimony to be

confirmed. Basanayke, CJ. in this judgment considered the following

passage of the Judgment in the case of Emperor Vs. Burn 11 Bombay

Law Reports that reads as follows: No man ought to be treated as an

accomplice on mere suspicion unless he confesses that he had a

conscious hand in the crime or he makes admission of the facts showing

that he had such a hand. If the evidence of a witness falls short of these

tests, he is not an accomplice; and his testimony must be judged on

principles applicable to ordinary witnesses.

The evidence of this case clearly demonstrates that PW-1 is not a guilty

associate in the crime. He did certain acts relating to the crime because

he was afraid of the accused-appellant, and he could not refuse to do

things when the appellant directed him to. It is evident that PW-1 did not

have a conscious hand in the crime. Hence, PW-1 could not be

considered as an accomplice.

In addition, in the case of Galagamage Indrawansa Kumarasiri and

three others V. W.M.M. Kumarihamy and Hon. Attorney General

S.C. TAB Appeal No. 02/2012, decided on 02.04.2014, it was held that

The definition of an accomplice in Sri Lankan Law, as accepted by the

Courts, clearly indicates that an accomplice must demonstrate common

intent and knowingly unite with the principal offender to commit the

crime but excludes the mere presence of witnesses in the vicinity of the

scene from coming within this definition.

Page 13 of 14

In the case at hand, PW-1 was accompanied by the appellant in certain

instances, but at any instance, PW-1 did not have common intent with

the accused-appellant to kill his parents and siblings. As stated

previously, because of the fear and inability to refuse what the appellant

told him to do, PW-1 did certain things he explained in his evidence.

Hence, it is precisely clear that PW-1 did not knowingly unite with the

accused-appellant with the common intent to kill his parents and

siblings. Therefore, according to the legal positions stated in the

aforesaid judicial authorities, there is a merit in the argument of the

learned DSG that even if the age of the child is disregarded, PW-1 is not

an accomplice.

Another argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant was

that the evidence of PW-1 is not credible in light of the contradictory

nature of his evidence. The learned DSG pointed out that although some

minor discrepancies were marked as contradictions, the main matters

pertaining to the crime that were described by PW-1 have never been

challenged in cross-examination. In perusing the impugned judgment of

the learned high court judge, it is apparent that he has considered the

contradictions marked and omissions brought to the attention of the

court by the defence in evaluating evidence. The learned judge has stated

reasons why those contradictions and omissions do not affect the

credibility of PW-1. The learned high court judge has looked into every

aspect of the case and evaluated entirety of the evidence of the case

carefully. It is my view that the learned high court judge has correctly

found that PW-1 is a credible witness and the court can act upon his

evidence. As previously stated, PW-1 can be considered as an ordinary

witness as well as a credible witness; therefore, his evidence can be relied

on without corroboration. I hold that the learned trial judge has come to

the correct conclusion after correctly analyzing the evidence of the case.

Page 14 of 14

For the foregoing reasons, I find no reason to interfere with the Judgment

of the learned High Court Judge dated 11.07.2017.

Accordingly, the Judgment dated 11.07.2017 is affirmed and the Appeal

is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
