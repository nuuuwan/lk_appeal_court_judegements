The court and tribunal structure provides a more or less rational appeal structure for those aggrieved by a judicial decision. The appellate court will have the power to reconsider the case and to substitute its own decision for that of the lower court. An appeal may be made on both the law and the facts of the case, so full re-hearing may take place. Judicial review, by contrast, is concerned solely with the manner in which the decision maker has applied relevant rules: it is thus procedural in nature. It is not for the court-in judicial review proceedings- to substitute its judgement for that of the decision-making body to which powers have been delegated but, rather, to ensure that the adjudicator has kept within the rules laid down by statute and the common law. In short, the role of the courts in judicial review is to exercise a supervisory, not an appellate, jurisdiction. Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was made.",
