Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the registered owner-petitioner-appellant

(hereinafter referred to as the appellant) seeking to challenge the judgment dated

06-04-2017, pronounced by the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the

Southern Province Holden in Tangalle.

The appellant has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction granted in terms of Article

154P of The Constitution by way of a revision application filed before the High

Court seeking to challenge and set aside the order dated 06-01-2016 pronounced

by the learned Magistrate of Tangalle, wherein the tipper truck numbered 43-

8739 belonging to him was ordered to be confiscated.

The above-mentioned tipper truck was a subject matter in the Magistrates Court

of Tangalle case number 6248.

The Officer-in-Charge of the Tangalle police has charged one Pattiyakumburage

Sunil Shantha for having transported 14 logs of Paaramaara timber valued at

Rs. 31,802/- in the tipper truck numbered 43-8739, without a valid permit on

01-08-2011, at a place called Maarakolliya, Godigamuwa, and thereby

committing an offence punishable in terms of section 40 read with section 25(2)

of the Forest Act.

Page 3 of 10

The said accused has pleaded guilty to the charge, and he has been fined

accordingly.

After having confiscated the timber, the learned Magistrate of Tangalle has

allowed the registered owner of the vehicle, who was not the accused, to show

cause as to why the tipper truck should not be confiscated.

At the inquiry held in that regard, the appellant who is the registered owner of

the vehicle, the accused who was the driver of the said vehicle, and a Buddhist

monk has given evidence.

The appellant in his evidence has stated that he purchased this vehicle about

two and a half years ago subjected to a finance facility. He has employed the

accused as its driver and has engaged this vehicle for the purposes of hiring. It

had been his evidence that he gave necessary instructions to the driver not to

engage in illegal activities, and he was vigilant whether the driver is using the

vehicle as instructed. The vehicle used to be parked in front of the drivers house

for hiring purposes. The registered owner has stated that he was in the habit of

calling the driver frequently and inquire about his activities. It had been his

evidence that there were no issues with the driver or any complaints that he was

doing illegal activities until he came to know about this detection.

It is clear from the Magistrates Court proceedings that the registered owner was

a person who was suffering from a nervous disorder, and hence, a person who

could not do things as a normal person in his day-to-day affairs. It appears from

his evidence that due to his illness, he was unable to remember some of the

details of the incident. He has stated that he cannot remember the name of his

driver or the date of the offence, but has maintained the position that what he

told the Court was the truth, and he was not lying in that regard.

The accused of the Magistrates Court case too has given evidence at the inquiry.

It had been his evidence that while working as the driver of the vehicle belonging

to the appellant, he received necessary instructions from him not to engage in

any illegal activities and his instructions were only to transport materials like

Page 4 of 10

bricks, sand, etc. He has stated that the registered owner used to inquire from

time to time as to his whereabouts and he never used the vehicle for any illegal

purpose.

Explaining what occurred on the day of the incident, he has stated that he was

engaged by a person called Susil to transport some bricks from Maarakolliya to

Pattiyapola area. It has been his position that after he transported the bricks to

the house of the said person, he met a female on his way, and she requested him

to transport the Paaramaara timber, which she claimed as timber donated to a

temple called Subodhaaramaya at Pattiyapola.

The driver has claimed that the timber comprised of 14 decaying outer parts of

a Paaramaara Tree ( ), and he agreed to transport the timber without

thinking further, because it was said to him that it was a donation to the temple.

He has stated that he received Rs. 250/- for the transportation, and had

admitted that he failed to follow the instructions given by the owner of the vehicle

on that instance.

The Buddhist priest who gave evidence has stated that he is from a temple called

Sambodhi Viharaya in Godigamuwa. He has stated that the temple was in need

of some timber and one of the benefactors () donated a Maara Tree in that

regard, and he informed a person called Sunil of his need to transport the timber

to the temple and he later came to know that the vehicle which transported the

timber had been taken into custody by the police.

It appears from the evidence of the priest that his evidence has been confusing

at its best. He has stated that the person he mentioned as Sunil was a driver,

but under cross-examination, it appears that the person who he mentioned as

Sunil was the benefactor who donated the tree to the temple, and had stated

that the vehicle also belongs to Sunil.

The position taken up by the prosecution had been that the drivers evidence had

not been that the tree was transported to Sambodhi Viharaya as stated by the

Page 5 of 10

priest in his evidence, but to a temple called Subodhaaramaya which was also

situated nearby.

In his order dated 06-01-2016, the learned Magistrate has considered the fact

that the owner of the vehicle being a person with a health condition and his

evidence that he used to be vigilant about his vehicle.

The learned Magistrate has determined that in the following manner.

.

.

The learned Magistrate has doubted the registered owners evidence where he

has stated that he used to inquire about the activities of the driver periodically,

and has considered the contradictions in the evidence of the driver and the

Buddhist priest to observe that the registered owner has failed to establish that

he has taken reasonable steps to prevent the offence being committed. The

vehicle has been confiscated on the said basis.

When the matter went up before the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle, it

appears that several objections has been raised as to the maintainability of the

charge before the learned Magistrate of Tangalle and also based on section 48 of

the Judicature Act, urging them as exceptional grounds that should require

invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court. The learned High Court Judge

has found that the said grounds raised have no bearing and the said grounds

cannot be considered as exceptional circumstances for the Court to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court. Accordingly, the revision application filed

by the appellant seeking to challenge the order of the learned Magistrate of

Tangalle has been dismissed.

When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned Counsel for the

appellant thought it fit to argue that the charge against the accused in the

Page 6 of 10

Magistrates Court was defective and hence, a conviction based on a defective

charge cannot attract the provisions of the Forest Ordinance where a vehicle can

be confiscated, among other matters brought to the notice of this Court by the

learned Counsel.

The contention was that in the charge preferred against the accused in the

Magistrates Court case, the prosecution has failed to refer to Forest

(Amendment) Act No. 65 of 2009.

However, it is clear from the charge preferred against the accused, the

prosecution has clearly informed the accused that he is being charged in terms

of section 40 read with section 25(2) of the Forest Ordinance. It is clear that the

accused has pleaded guilty knowing very well the charge for which he is pleading

guilty. The registered owner of the vehicle had not been misled in any manner

as he has taken steps to call evidence to establish that he had no knowledge of

the offence and he took due precautions to prevent such an offence being

committed.

I find no reasons to accept that there was a defect in the charge sheet or a defect

that has a vitiating effect on the inquiry held after the conviction.

At the hearing of this application, the learned State Counsel took up a

preliminary objection as to the maintainability of this application on the basis

that the appellant has sought to set aside only the judgement of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge of Tangalle, and not the order of the learned

Magistrate of Tangalle in the prayer of the petition of appeal.

Citing the judgement pronounced in the Court of Appeal case number

CA/PHC/APN/141/16 decided on 25-01-2017, it was the contention of the

learned State Counsel that the appeal should stand dismissed on that ground

alone.

Page 7 of 10

However, I am of the view that the matters considered in the above-mentioned

case were much different to the appeal before this Court. In the said case, the

application has been dismissed on the basis that the petitioner has sought to set

aside a non-existing order, alleged to have been given on a certain date.

In the case under consideration, the appellant has sought to set aside the

judgement pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle in an

application to challenge the order made by the learned Magistrate of Tangalle,

who ordered the confiscation of the vehicle belonging to the appellant. I am of

the view that although it would have been better for the appellant to pray for the

setting aside of the learned Magistrates order, since the appellant has sought to

set aside the judgement of the learned High Court Judge, where he has sought

the setting aside of the order of the learned Magistrate, if set aside, in my view,

it would amount to setting aside of the order of the learned Magistrate as well.

Therefore, I do not find a basis for the preliminary objection taken up by the

learned State Counsel.

Having considered the facts, circumstances, and the order of the learned

Magistrate, it is clear as I highlighted above, that the learned Magistrate has not

doubted that the registered owner has given necessary instructions to the driver

not to engage in illegal activities. The learned Magistrate has considered the

evidence of the appellant, as well as, that of the accused of the Magistrates Court

case as credible evidence up to that extent. However, based on the apparent

contradictions of the evidence of the driver with regard to the transporting of

timber to a certain place and that of the priest who gave evidence to substantiate

the evidence of the driver, it has been determined that the registered owner has

not taken reasonable steps to prevent the offence being committed.

It is settled law that in an inquiry of this nature, the burden of proof is in the

balance of probability. It is my considered view that any evidence given in an

inquiry needs to be considered in the context of the given facts and the

Page 8 of 10

circumstances unique to each case. There is no doubt that the owner of the

vehicle is a person who is suffering from a nervous disorder. It has to be

understood that such a person cannot physically inspect the vehicle all the time.

I find that he has given clear evidence as to the instructions he gave to his driver,

and the steps he used to take in order to be vigilant about his vehicle. I am not

in a position to accept that the contradictions between the evidence of the driver

and the priest, should be considered against the stand taken by the registered

owner in his evidence, as it has been established that he had no hand in the

illegal transportation of the timer.

In the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In Charge Of Nortonbridge Police

Station (2014) 1 SLR 33, it was observed that,

I have to admit that nowhere in the said inquiry proceedings there is

evidence that the appellant had taken all precautions to prevent the

commission of the offence. However, at the inquiry the appellant has given

evidence and stated, he purchased the lorry on 26-02-2000 and gave it to

his son to transport tea leaves. Further stated, that he had no knowledge

about transporting of timber. The learned Magistrate in his order has

accepted the fact that the appellant did not have any knowledge about the

transporting of timber without a permit.

Nevertheless, the learned Magistrate has confiscated the lorry. I am of the

view before making the order of confiscation the learned Magistrate should

have taken into consideration, value of the timber transported, no

allegations prior to this incident that the lorry had been used for any illegal

purpose, that the appellant and or the accused are habitual offenders in this

nature and no previous convictions, and the acceptance of the fact that the

appellant did not have any knowledge about the transporting of timber

without a permit. On these facts the Court is of the view that the confiscation

of the lorry is not justifiable.

Page 9 of 10

I am of the view that after determining as to the knowledge of the appellant and

the fact that he has given necessary instructions to the driver, the learned

Magistrate should have taken a more pragmatic view of the evidence, rather than

determining it in a manner to conclude that the appellant has failed to establish

he has taken due precautions. I am of the view that if considered in the correct

perspective, there was sufficient evidence before the learned Magistrate on the

balance of probability to justify the release of the vehicle to the appellant.

I am also of the view that these factual matters should have been considered by

the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle before the revision application filed by

the appellant was dismissed.

At this juncture, I would like to quote again from the case of Sadi Banda Vs.

Officer In Charge Of Nortonbridge Police Station (supra), which I believe

relevant in the above context.

The revisionary power of Court is a discretionary power. This is an

extraordinary jurisdiction which is exercised by the Court and the grant of

relief is entirely dependent of the Court. The grant of such relief is of course

a matter entirely in the discretion of the Court, and always be dependent on

the circumstances of each case. Existence of exceptional circumstances is

the process by which the extraordinary power of revision should be adopted.

The exceptional circumstances would vary from case to case and their

degree of exceptionality must be correctly assessed and gauged by Court

taking into consideration all antecedent circumstances using the yardstick

whether a failure of justice would occur unless revisionary powers are

invoked.

For the reasons as stated above, I set aside the judgement dated 04-06-2017

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court Judge

of the Southern Province Holden in Tangalle and the order dated 06-01-2016 by

the learned Magistrate of Tangalle, as I find no reason to allow them to stand.

Page 10 of 10

Accordingly, I order the release of the vehicle numbered 43-8739 to its registered

owner.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement along with

the original case record for the relevant High Court for information, and to the

relevant Magistrates Court for necessary compliance.

Appeal allowed.
