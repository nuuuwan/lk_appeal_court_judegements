Introduction

The 2nd Party RespondentPetitionerPetitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) has filed this revision application against the Plaintiff Respondent-

Respondent, officer in charge of Police Station, Dehiwala and 1st Party

RespondentRespondentRespondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent). The Petitioner seeks to canvass the judgment delivered by the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo on 12th March 2024, refusing to revise the

order made by the learned Magistrate of Mount Lavinia on 21st February 2024

instituted under Section 69(2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of

1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Primary Courts Procedure Act).

The Petitioner further seeks to have the aforementioned order of the Magistrate

set aside and the Petitioner be declared entitled to possess the land marked X

4

CA/CPA/0028/2024

in the sketch submitted by the police and/or the land described in the deed of

declaration No. 1098, dated 23rd January 1990. Additionally, the Petitioner seeks

the dismissal of the information filed by the Police, marked as P1.

Factual background

On 20th July 2023, the Respondent lodged a complaint with the Dehiwala Police

regarding an obstruction to a right of way. The Respondent claimed the right to

access her sisters land over the disputed portion, on the strength of a Special

Power of Attorney granted to her by her sister1.

Following an inquiry into the complaint, the Officer in Charge of the Dehiwala

Police Station submitted information to the Magistrates Court of Mount Lavinia

under Section 66(1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

The learned Magistrate declared that the Respondent is entitled to use the 10 feet

wide road marked with arrows across Lot X in the sketch submitted by the

Police.

The aggrieved Petitioner moved the High Court to revise the order but was

refused.

The Petitioner appealed the said decision to this Court.

Analysis

The Petitioner presented the following matters in her Petition as exceptional

circumstances that warrant the intervention of this Court in exercising its

extraordinary revisionary powers.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner reiterated these grounds at the argument.

Those are;

i. No breach of peace or threatened breach of peace.

ii. The Respondent does not have possession to the disputed land.

1 Documents marked as X18 at the Magistrates Court.

5

CA/CPA/0028/2024

iii. The land owned by the Respondents sister has thirty feet road frontage

towards the Quarry Road which could provide access to the land.

Next, I will address the aforementioned grounds raised by the Petitioner.

i. No breach of peace or threatened breach of peace.

The officer in charge of Dehiwala Police Station filed an information in the

Magistrates Court indicating that the Respondent filed a complaint on 20th July

2023, alleging that the Petitioner obstructed their right of way, used for accessing

their land for many years, by constructing a boundary wall and a gate. The report

notes that during the inquiry at the Police Station, both parties refused to resolve

the dispute in the District Court and exhibited agitated behavior. Consequently,

the Police determined that there was a likelihood of a breach of the peace and

referred both parties to the Magistrates Court.

As it was held in the case of Velupillai v. Sivanathan2 when an information is

filed under Section 66 (1)(a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the formation

of the opinion as to whether a breach of the peace is threatened or likely is left

to the Police Officer inquiring into the dispute. The Police Officer is empowered

to file the information if there is a dispute affecting land and a breach of the peace

is threatened or likely. In such an instance the Magistrate is not put on inquiry as

to whether a breach of the peace is threatened or likely and the Court is vested

with jurisdiction to inquire into and make a determination on the dispute.

In the more recent case of Jayasinghe and others v. Loku Bandara3 His Lordship

Samayawardhena J., (sitting in Court of Appeal as his Lordship then was)

comprehensively analysed both the Sections 66 (1) and (2) and also compared

those with the similar provisions in the repealed Administration of Justice Law4

and the corresponding provision of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure,

19735 and reaffirmed the decision in Velupillai and others v. Sivanathan

regarding Section 66 (1)(a). His Lordship went a further step ahead and held that

2 [1993]1 Sri L.R. 123. 3 [2019]2 Sri L.R. 202. 4 No. 44 of 1973. 5 Section 145.

6

CA/CPA/0028/2024

even when an information is filed by a party to the dispute under Section 66

(1)(b), the Magistrate is vested with jurisdiction to inquire into it.

Accordingly, I am satisfied that a threatened breach of the peace existed, and the

learned Magistrate is vested with the jurisdiction to inquire into the matter.

ii. The Respondent does not have possession of the disputed land.

The Petitioner asserts that she was in possession of the disputed land at the

time the Police filed information in the Magistrates Court of Mount-Lavinia on

10th August 2023, and for at least two months prior to that date. The Petitioner

contends that her claim to the disputed land is based on Deed No. 526, executed

by D.S. Gamini, Notary Public, on 4th September 1991. This deed grants her title

to an undivided 7.5 perches from Lot B in Plan No. 9947, dated 20th September

1970, prepared by H.S.B. Wijesekara, Licensed Surveyor.

Additionally, the Petitioner claims ownership of 0.7 perches from the same land,

upon deed No. 1879 executed by M. N. P. Fernando, Notary Public, on 4th July

19928. This 0.7-perch parcel is depicted in Plan No. 6013, dated 26th January

1991, prepared by L.J. Liyanage, Licensed Surveyor9. Notably, this parcel is

adjacent to the 0.8-perch parcel owned by the Respondents sister. Both parcels

of land are situated between Quarry Road and the means of access shown in Plan

No. 6013.

The Petitioner asserts her title to Lot E1 in Plan No. 231710, dated 12th June

1989, prepared by H.F.B. Wijesekara, Licensed Surveyor. This plan indicates that

Lot 'E1' is a subdivision of Lot 'E,' as shown in Plan No. 994, which also depicts

the lands described in the title deeds of both the Petitioner and the Respondent.

Therefore, it is evident that by executing the aforementioned deed of declaration,

the Petitioner has asserted her title to the common right of way illustrated in Plan

No. 994.

CA/CPA/0028/2024

However, the learned Magistrate has noted in her order that the Respondent has

established nonexistence of a Notary by the name of P.A.G.B. Abeyratne, who is

alleged to have attested the deed of declaration No. 1038, dated 23rd January

1990. This was demonstrated by presenting the Registrar Generals letter marked

Y2. Furthermore, the extracts marked X56, confirms that no such deed is

registered at the Land Registry.

According to the Petitioner, there is no individual currently in actual physical

possession of the land. The Petitioner contends that the address provided by the

Respondent in her affidavit does not correspond to the location of the land owned

by her sister, which bolsters this assertion. Notably, the Respondent has not

claimed that she or her sister resides on the property. Instead, the Respondent

states that she and her family lived on the land from her birth until 201711, after

which the old house was demolished in 2018 at her sister's request to facilitate

the development of the property12. The Respondent maintains that she and her

family members have used the disputed right of way for over 50 years, until the

current dispute arose13. To support her position, the Respondent submitted the

documents referred to in her affidavit.

The Respondent has further asserted her right to direct rainwater into the

Municipal Council drainage system via the disputed roadway14. In her counter

affidavit15, the Petitioner has countered this claim, stating that it was merely a

bare assertion without supporting evidence. Nevertheless, the learned

Magistrate, after considering the matter at hand, concluded that because water

naturally flows from higher to lower elevations, it is reasonable to assume that

rainwater passed through the means of access16.

Another argument advanced by the Petitioner is that the Respondent did not

establish the date of dispossession and did not even raise an issue as to the date

11 Paragraph 3(d) of the affidavit. 12 Paragraph 3(g) of the affidavit. 13 Paragraphs 3(j) and 4(a) to (g) of the affidavit. 14 Paragraph 4(b) of the affidavit. 15 At paragraph 9 (), at page 335 of the brief. 16 At page 27 of the order, at page 40 of the brief.

CA/CPA/0028/2024

of forcible dispossession. However, the information submitted to the

Magistrates Court of Mount-Lavinia itself is on an obstruction caused to a right

of way. Further, the Respondents complaint made to the Police on the 20th July

2023 is also regarding an obstruction caused to her right of way. John Dimantha

Kohomban Wickramage, who is said to have accompanied the Respondent to the

land on the 20th July 2023 also confirms in his statement made to Dehiwala

Police on the 20th July 2023 that the right of way was obstructed by putting up a

wall and a gate.

Another argument presented by the Petitioner is that the Respondent has failed

to establish the date of dispossession and did not raise any issue regarding the

timing of the alleged forcible dispossession. However, the information submitted

to the Magistrates Court of Mount-Lavinia clearly pertains to an obstruction of

a right of way. Additionally, the Respondent's complaint to the Police on 20th

July 2023 also addresses the obstruction to her right of way. John Dimantha

Kohomban Wickramage, who is said to have accompanied the Respondent to the

land on that date, confirmed in his statement to the Dehiwala Police that the right

of way was obstructed by the construction of a wall and gate.

In her statement responding to the complaint made by the Respondent, the

Petitioner acknowledges that she constructed a wall for the safety of her property.

However, she denies encroaching on any portion of the Respondents land. The

Petitioner asserts that the disputed right of way is her own property. As

mentioned earlier in this order, her claim is based on the deed of declaration, the

authenticity of which has not been established.

The Police Officer who investigated in to the complaint made by the Respondent

also confirmed that there was an obstruction to the Respondents right of way

due to the construction of a new wall and gate17. According to the sketch

prepared by the same officer, the matter pertains to a dispute regarding the

obstruction of a right of way.

CA/CPA/0028/2024

In the case of Ramalingam v. Thangarajah18 His Lordship Sharvananda J., who

later became Chief Justice, examined Section 62 of the repealed Administration

of Justice Law19, which was applicable before the enactment of Chapter VII of

the Primary Courts Procedure Act. He made the following observations:

In an inquiry into a dispute as to the possession of any land, where a breach of

peace is threatened or is likely under Part VII, of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act, the main point for decision is the actual possession of the land on the date

of the filing of the information under section 66; but where forcible dispossession

took place within two months before the date on which the said information was

filed the main point is actual possession prior to that alleged date of

dispossession. Section 68 is only concerned with the determination as to who

was in possession of the land or the part on the date of the filing of the

information under section 66. It directs the Judge to declare that the person who

was in such possession was entitled to possession of the land or part thereof

Section 68(3) becomes applicable only if the Judge can come to a definite finding

that some other party had been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two

months next proceeding the date on which the information was filed under

section 66.

His Lordship has further observed;

On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land other than

right of possession of such land, the question for decision, according to section

69(1), is who is entitled to the right which is subject of dispute. The word

entitle here connotes the ownership of the right. The Court has to determine

which of the parties has acquired that right, or is entitled for the time being to

exercise that right. In contradistinction to section 68, section 69 requires the

Court to determine the question which party is entitled to the disputed right

preliminary to making an order under section 69(2).

18 [1982]2 Sri L.R. 693. 19 Supra note 4.

CA/CPA/0028/2024

Under Section 145 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, which parallels our

provisions, when the dispute concerns possession, similar to Section 68(3) of our

Primary Courts Procedure Act, the Magistrate must determine whether the party

claiming possession has been forcibly and wrongfully dispossessed within the

two months preceding the filing of the information. In contrast, when the dispute

involves rights other than possession, Section 147 of the Indian Code stipulates

that if the dispute pertains to the right to use any land or water throughout the

year, the Magistrate must confirm whether such a right has been exercised within

three months prior to the filing of the information.

However, as previously mentioned, our law does not impose any specific time

frame for disputes concerning rights other than the right to possession. Instead,

the focus is on determining the entitlement to the right itself.

This dispute falls under the scope of Section 69(1) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, rather than Section 68(2).

The learned Magistrate, in her impugned order, correctly identified the dispute

as one affecting land that pertains to a right other than the right to possess the

land.

Consequently, the learned Magistrate identified the following issues to be

resolved during the inquiry:

i. Whether the Respondent has a right of way over the disputed land.

ii. Whether the Petitioner obstructed the right of way by constructing a wall

and a gate.

In the cited quotation from the judgment in Ramalingam v. Thangarajah20 His

Lordship Sharvananda J. explains that the term entitle signifies ownership of the

right. The Court's role is to ascertain which party has acquired that right or is

currently entitled to exercise it.

20 Supra note 18.

CA/CPA/0028/2024

In the case of Punchi Nona v. Padumasena and others21 (C.A.), His Lordship

Ismail J. has observed that;

The jurisdiction conferred on a Primary Court under section 66 is a special

jurisdiction. It is a quasi-criminal jurisdiction. The primary object of the

jurisdiction so conferred is the prevention of a breach of the peace arising in

respect of a dispute affecting land. The Court in exercising this jurisdiction is not

involved in an investigation into title or the right to possession which is the

function of a civil court. He is required to take action of a preventive and

provisional nature pending final adjudication of rights in a Civil Court.

Any order issued under Section 69(1) is a temporary measure that remains in

effect until the dispute is conclusively resolved by a competent court, in this case,

the District Court. Therefore, the standard of proof required to establish the right

does not need to match that of a District Court action.

As correctly noted by the learned Magistrate, the entitlement to a right of way in

an application under Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act does not

need to be established in the same manner as it would be in a civil action.

However, when the legislature uses the term right in a statute, it is intended to

denote a right that is recognizable under existing laws. In instances where the

right pertains to a servitude, Section 75 explicitly states that it has to be a right

in the nature of a servitude. In an appropriate situation, it could be a way of

necessity to address a fundamental necessity.

In my opinion, the definition of the term dispute affecting land provided in

Section 75 is not exhaustive and may encompass other related disputes

concerning land. The use of the word includes in Section 75 supports this

perspective.

In the case at hand, when determining whether the Respondent has acquired any

right to use the disputed roadway, it is important to note that both the Respondent

and the Petitioner have right to its use as per their respective title deeds.

21 [1994]2 Sri L.R. 117, at p. 117.

12

CA/CPA/0028/2024

The Respondent's sister holds title to half of Lot 'A' in Plan No. 99422 (Lot 1 in

Plan No. 156223) as per deed No. 1482 dated 13th September 2003, attested by

T.G. Jayasekara, Notary Public. 24. The remaining portion of Lot 'A' in Plan 99425

(Lot 2 in Plan No. 1562) is conveyed to her by deed No. 1483, also dated 13th

September 2003 and attested by the same Notary Public. Additionally, the

Respondent's father had title to 0.8 perches of the same land under deed No. 1878

dated 4th July 1992, attested by M.N.P. Fernando, Notary Public26. Subsequently,

through deed of rectification No. 1736 dated 29th January 2017, attested by T.G.

Jayasekara, Notary Public27, the parcel of land in an extent of 0.8 perches was

also incorporated into the previously mentioned deed of transfer No. 1483.

The entitlement to use the right of way designated as Lot 'E' (a reservation for 10

feet wide road) is granted in both title deeds 1482 and 1483. Notably, the

Petitioner also reserves the right to use this same right of way in her title deed

No. 52 dated 4th September 1991, attested by D.M.S. Gamini, Notary Public.

Therefore, I am of the view that both the Respondent and the Petitioner have

sufficiently demonstrated their ownership of the right to use the disputed right of

way, as required for an application under Section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act.

iii. The land owned by the Respondents sister has thirty feet road frontage

towards the Quarry Road which could provide access to the land.

The next issue to consider is whether the Respondent's sister has alternative

access to her land aside from the disputed right of way. As previously analyzed,

the usage of Lot 'E' in Plan No. 99428 is granted to the Respondent's sister, whom

the Respondent represents under the Power of Attorney. Additionally, the

22 At page 330. 23 At Page 84. 24 At page 86. 25 At page 330.

26 At pages 79 of the brief.

27 At page 94 of the brief. 28 At page 330 of the brief.

13

CA/CPA/0028/2024

disputed right of way is illustrated in several subsequent plans included in the

record as well29.

As previously mentioned in this judgment, the Respondent stated that the public

road, the Quarry Road, and the Respondent's sister's land are situated at different

elevations. Therefore, although the Petitioner asserts that the Respondent's land

has a thirty feet road frontage along the Quarry Road, the Respondent is unable

to access her property through this route.

The fact that the disputed roadway has been depicted as providing means of

access to the subdivided Lots 'A', 'B', and 'C' of Plan No. 994 and in all

subsequent plans made30 over nearly 50 years (from 1970 to 2018) supports the

Respondent's position. This demonstrates that the Quarry Road may indeed be at

a different elevation, rendering it inaccessible to the lower allotments of land.

While the Petitioner may have encroached upon part of Lot 'E', the means of

access, and filled her property to facilitate access from the Quarry Road, this

does not negate another person's legal right to access through the disputed

roadway. Furthermore, established law stipulates that when land is subdivided,

access must be provided within the same property.

In light of the above analysis, I am of the view that the Respondent is entitled,

for the time being, to use Lot 'E' in Plan No. 994 as a means of access to Lot

'A'.

The learned Magistrate, after considering the information submitted by the

Police, the affidavits, counter affidavits, and the documents presented by both

parties, has rightly identified the conflict between the Petitioner and the

Respondent as a land dispute concerning a right other than possession of the land

or any portion of it. As a result, the learned Magistrate has determined that the

29 Lot B, in Plan No.6013 dated 26th January 1991 made by L. G, Liyanage, License Surveyor, at page 83 of the appeal brief; Plan No. 1562 dated 24th November 1997 made by J.M.C. Fernando, License Surveyor, at page 84 of the appeal brief; Plan No. 13122 dated 6th March 2018 made by Gamini B. Dodanwela, at pages 98,112 and 362 of the appeal brief; Plan No. 2317 dated 12th June 1989 made by H.F.B. Wijesekara, License Surveyor, at page 200; 30 Plan No. 2317 made on 12th June 1989, 6013 made on 26th January 1991, 1562 made on 24th November 1997, Plan No.13122 made on 6th March 2018.

14

CA/CPA/0028/2024

Respondent is entitled to use the 10 feet wide disputed right of way and that the

Petitioner has obstructed this right by constructing a wall and installing a gate.

Consequently, the learned Magistrate has proceeded to issue an order to remove

the obstructions caused to the right of way and to remove the part of the wall and

the gate as required to give effect to the order.

In the case of Jamis v. Kanangara31 (C.A.) Palakindnar J. observed that;

The order that can be made under this subsection in regard to a right to any

land other than the right to possession is a declaration of entitlement of such

right after determination by the court subject to final determination by a

competent court and prohibit all disturbance or interference with an exercise of

such right by such party.

The order therefore is clearly of a prohibitory nature preventing an interference

with the exercise of such a right.

Whether such an order would lawfully include the removal of a structure is a

matter which can only draw a negative reply. An order to remove the structure is

not an order prohibiting the disturbance or interference with a declared right.

As a result, His Lordship reversed the order issued by the learned Primary Court

Judge that mandated the removal of the house.

In the more recent case of Tudor v. Anulawathie and others32 (C.A.)

Gunawardana J., declined to follow the decision in Jamis v. Kanangara33 and

observed that; there is no specific provision in the Primary Courts Procedure

Act expressly enabling the court to order removal of obstructions in the way of

restoration of the right to the person entitle thereto in terms of the determination

made by the court; nor is there a prohibition either, against the court exercising

such a power or making such an order. () the courts are not to act on the

principle that the procedure is to be taken as prohibited unless it is expressly

31 [1989]2 Sri L.R. 350, at p. 351. 32 [1999]3 Sri L.R. 235, at page 252. 33 Supra note 31.

15

CA/CPA/0028/2024

provided for by the Code but on the convers principle that every procedure is to

be understood as permissible till it is shown to be prohibited by the Code.

I prefer to adhere to the decision in the case of Tudor v. Anulawathie34 and others,

as it seems to be more reasonable and logical.

The Petitioner has sought the exercise of this Court's revisionary jurisdiction

concerning both the order of the learned High Court Judge and the order of the

learned Magistrate. In the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd and others v. Mercantile

Hotels Management Ltd35, Sharvananda C.J. observed that:

It is settled law that the exercise of revisionary powers of the Appellate Court is

confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist warranting its

intervention.

In the case of Divisional Secretary Kalutara v. Kalupahana Mestrige Jayathissa

and others36 Supreme Court observed that;

It must be noted that the Respondents had invoked revisionary jurisdiction of

this court, which is discretionary remedy. Thus, if relief to be granted, the party

seeking the relief has to establish that, not only the impugned Order is illegal,

but also the nature of the illegality is such, that it shocks the conscience of the

court.

I observe that the learned High Court Judge has carefully examined the

impugned order of the learned Magistrate, taking into account the pertinent

statutory provisions and relevant judicial precedents. As a result, the learned

High Court Judge has appropriately concluded that there are no exceptional

circumstances warranting interference with the learned Magistrate's decision.

Based on the reasons articulated above, this Court finds that the Petitioner has

not established a prima facie case or presented a matter that warrants further

examination by this Court. Therefore, I see no grounds to interfere with the

impugned orders made by either the learned High Court Judge or the learned

34 Supra note 32. 35 [1987]1 Sri L.R. at page 05. 36 SC Appeals 246, 247, 249, 250/14.

Magistrate. After considering all the submitted materials and the arguments of

both Counsel, this Court concludes that this application is without merit.

Consequently, we are not inclined to issue formal notice to the Respondents.

In light of the above analysis, this Application is dismissed, with costs set at Rs.

50,000/-.
