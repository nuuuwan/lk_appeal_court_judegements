This is an appeal preferred by the accused-appellants (hereinafter referred to as

the appellants) on the basis of being aggrieved by the sentence imposed upon

them by the learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala after they pleaded guilty

to the charges preferred against them.

The appellants were initially indicted before the High Court of Kurunegala for

committing the following offences.

1. That they conspired with a common intention to do or aid and abet to

commit the destruction of a building belonging to the Kurunegala

Municipal Council situated at No. 01, Kurunegala-Dambulla Road, and

committed the offence of conspiracy to commit mischief to the said

building on or about 14-07-2020 at Kurunegala within the jurisdiction

of the High Court of Kurunegala, and thereby committed an offence

punishable in terms of section 02 of the Offences Against Public

Page 4 of 12

Property Act No. 12 of 1982 as amended by the Offences Against Public

Property (Amendment) Act No. 76 of 1988 and 28 of 1999 read with

section 113B, 102 and 410 of the Penal Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction as mentioned in count

1, the 4th and the 5th appellants caused mischief to the earlier

mentioned public property by demolishing it which had a value of Rs.

7,250,000/-, and thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of

section 02 of the Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982

as amended by the Offences Against Public Property (Amendment) Act

No. 76 of 1988 and 28 of 1999 read with section 32 and 408 of the

Penal Code.

3. At the same time and at the same transaction as mentioned in count

1, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellants instigated or conspired or aided and

abetted the 4th and 5th appellants to commit the said mischief, and

thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of section 02 of the

Offences Against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 as amended by the

Offences Against Public Property (Amendment) Act No. 76 of 1988 and

28 of 1999 read with section 102 of the Penal Code.

4. At the same time and at the same transaction as mentioned in count

1, the 4th and the 5th appellants destroyed the earlier mentioned

building which was an ancient monument, and thereby committed an

offence punishable in terms of section 15B of the Antiquities Ordinance

No. 9 of 1940 as amended by Antiquities (Amendment) Act No. 24 of

1998 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

5. At the same time and at the same transaction as mentioned in count

1, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd appellants conspired, instigated or aided and

Antiquities (Amendment) Act No. 24 of 1998 read with section 102 of

the Penal Code.

After the indictment was forwarded to the High Court of Kurunegala, and before

the appellants were served with summons, they have filed a motion through their

Counsel with notice to the Hon. Attorney General who is the complainant-

respondent of this matter, and has gotten the matter mentioned before the High

Court on 14-12-2023.

The learned Presidents Counsel who represented the appellants had intimated

to the Court that the appellants are willing to get the matter concluded by way

of a shortcut and has urged the Court to facilitate the same.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who represented the complainant-

respondent before the High Court has agreed to that suggestion, and upon his

request, the matter has been adjourned for a while. Accordingly, when the High

Court reassembled, it has been informed to the Court by the learned DSG that

he was informed by the learned Presidents Counsel who represented the

appellants that the appellants are willing to plead guilty to a lesser offence than

what was mentioned in the indictment, and they are also willing to pay the full

amount assessed by the National Building Research Organization as the cost of

reconstruction of the building, which amounts to a sum of Rs. 13.75 Million.

Accordingly, as requested, the said amount has been deposited to the Court

account with the permission of the learned High Court Judge, and the

prosecution has amended the 1st three counts of the indictment by removing the

penal section which has been referred as section 02 of the Offences Against

Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 as amended, and by amending the said three

counts as offences punishable in terms of section 410 of the Penal Code.

This goes on to show that the prosecution too has well facilitated the process of

concluding the matter without the action being going into a protracted trial.

Once the amended indictment was read over to the appellants, all of them have

unconditionally pleaded guilty to the respective charges preferred against them.

Page 6 of 12

The prosecution as well as the appellants have made their respective

submissions before the Court. On behalf of the prosecution, the learned DSG

has made submissions as to the aggravating circumstances, while the learned

Presidents Counsel who represented the appellants has pleaded in mitigation

urging the Court s indulgence to consider leniency in sentencing the appellants.

The learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala pronouncing his sentencing order

on the same day, namely, on 14-12-2023, and after having considered the

mitigatory and the aggravating circumstances, and the fact that the appellants

have unconditionally pleaded guilty for all the respective counts preferred

against them, has sentenced the appellants in the following manner.

On count 1, all the appellants have been sentenced to a period of 1 year

each rigorous imprisonment, and in addition, they have been ordered to

pay Rs. 25,000/- each fine. In default of the fine, each appellant to serve

a period of 6 months simple imprisonment.

On count 2, the 4th and the 5th appellants have been sentenced to a period

of 1 year each rigorous imprisonment, and in addition, they have been

ordered to pay Rs. 50,000/- each fine. In default of the fine, each appellant

to serve a period of 6 months each simple imprisonment.

On count 3, 1st, 2nd and the 3rd appellants have been sentenced to a period

of 1 year each rigorous imprisonment, and in addition, they have been

ordered to pay Rs. 50,000/- each fine. In default of the fine, each appellant

to serve a period of 6 months each simple imprisonment.

On count 4, the 4th and the 5th appellants have been sentenced to a period

of 1 year each rigorous imprisonment, and in addition, they have been

ordered to pay Rs. 50,000/- each fine. In default of the fine, each appellant

to serve a period of 6 months each simple imprisonment.

Page 7 of 12

On count 5, 1st, 2nd and 3rd appellants have been sentenced to a period of

1 year each rigorous imprisonment, and in addition, they have been

ordered to pay Rs. 50,000/- each fine. In default of the fine, each appellant

to serve a period of 6 months each simple imprisonment.

Since the learned High Court Judge has not stated that the sentences should be

served concurrently to each other, for all intended purposes, the appellants

sentences should be considered as consecutive to each other, which means each

appellant have been sentenced to a total period of 3 years rigorous

imprisonment, in addition to the fines, and the default sentences imposed upon

them.

When this matter was mentioned before this Court for consideration, it was

informed by the learned Presidents Counsel and the other learned Counsel who

represented the appellants that they will restrict the arguments of their appeal c

only in order to urge this Court to consider varying the sentences imposed upon

the appellants, for them to serve the sentences concurrently to each other.

Therefore, it needs to be noted that this appeal against the sentence was

considered only on that basis.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel and the other

learned Counsel who represented the appellants submitted that, since the

offences under which the appellants were charged and pleaded guilty relates to

one and the same incident, the learned High Court Judge should have

considered imposing the sentences to run concurrently to each other. The

learned Counsel justified their application in that regard citing the judicial

precedents in a situation of this nature.

The learned DSG who represented the Hon. Attorney General opposed the

application stating that there was no basis for the learned High Court Judge to

order that the sentences should be concurrent to each other, and therefore, the

Page 8 of 12

sentencing order of the learned High Court Judge was justified and there is no

basis for this Court to interfere with the sentencing order of the learned High

Court Judge.

There can be no doubt that the five counts preferred against the appellants had

been based on one incident, namely the destruction of a building. The above fact

is very much clear in the manner in which the indictment has been presented to

the High Court. The 1st count has been a charge against all the 5 appellants

based on conspiracy, and thereby agreeing to commit mischief by destroying a

building, punishable in terms of section 410 of the Penal Code. The said offence

was said to have been committed on or about 14-07-2020.

The mentioned 2nd to 5th counts are counts relating to the 1st count as mentioned

in the said counts itself.

Archbold 2019 at page 5A-171 referrers to sentencing policy that should be

considered when sentencing an offender for offences arising from the same

incident in the following manner.

As a general principle, consecutive terms should not be imposed for

offences which arise out of the same transaction or incident, whether or not

they arise out of precisely the same facts, but much is left to the discretion

of the Court : See R. Vs. Lawrence, 11 Cr.App.R.(S.) 580, CA; R. Vs. Noble

(2002) EWCA Crim 1713; (2003) 1 Cr.App.R.(S.) 65 (consecutive sentences

for causing death by dangerous driving quashed; exceptional cases

justifying departure from the normal principle tend to involve different

offences)

A Court may depart from the principle requiring concurrent sentences for

offences forming part of one transaction if there are exceptional

circumstances: R. Vs. Wheatley, 5 Cr.App.R.(S.) 417, CA; and R. Vs. Billon,

ibid. at 439, CA. See also R. Vs. Jordan (1996) 1 Cr.App.R.(S.) 181, CA; and

R. Vs. Fletcher (2002) EWCA Crim 834; (2002) 2 Cr.App.R.(S.) 127

Page 9 of 12

(consecutive sentences for indecent assault and threats to kill arising from

the same incident justified, the gravamen of the offence being different).

In the case of Rex Vs. R.P.D. Hotha and Another 34 CLW 11, the two appellants

were convicted under 6 counts for offences committed in the course of the same

transaction. The sentences imposed were ordered to run consecutively, but the

total of the sentences did not exceed the total which would have been passed for

the most serious of those offences. On appeal against the sentence, the Court

expressed the view that it would be better in such cases to make sentences run

concurrently, and varied the sentence giving effect to the opinion to the Presiding

Judge that the accused merited a sentence of at least 10 years.

In the judgment, Canon, J. observed;

An interesting point has been raised by Mr. Kumarakulasingham for the

appellant as a ground for their appeal against the sentence. He submits that

the indictment is prolix in so far that some of the offences charged constitute

part of the other offences which have been separately charged and that

therefore, the sentences passed for such offences should have been made

concurrent and not consecutive. In support of this submissions, he cites

section 67 of the Penal Code, the first paragraph of which reads:

Where anything which is an offence is made of parts any of which

parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the

punishment for more than one of such offences, unless it be so

expressly provided.

In the case of Jayasuirya Vs. Ratnayake, S.I. Police 44 CLW 47, Gratiaen, J.

observed;

Both charges relate to the same incident and to the use of same abusive

and filthy language, so that one single conviction and certainly one sentence

would in any event have met the ends of justice. If the man offends against

the law, it seems to me contrary to the principle and to the spirit of section

Page 10 of 12

67 of the Penal Code to punish him more than once for what he has done

merely because a single Act happens to contravene more than one provision

of the criminal law.

When it comes to the facts relevant to this case, as I have stated before, all the

charges emanate from the incident of causing destruction to the building

situated at No. 01, Kurunegala-Dambulla Road. It is amply clear that the learned

High Court Judge has well considered the aggravating circumstances as well as

the mitigatory circumstances pleaded on behalf of the appellants when

sentencing the appellants for 01 year each rigorous imprisonment for each of the

separate counts preferred against them and the fines. Since the appellants no

longer canvass the sentence per se, it is the view of this Court that no further

comment would be necessary in that regard.

However, it is my considered view that in sentencing the appellants, the attention

of the learned High Court Judge should have drawn to the charges filed against

the appellants in order to decide whether the sentence should be concurrent or

consecutive, with the relevant sentencing principles in mind.

It needs to be observed, that the 1st and the 3rd count preferred relates to the

same alleged conspiracy. In my view, when the 1st count refers to all the 5

appellants engaging in a conspiracy and to aid and abet to cause mischief to the

mentioned building, and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of

section 410 of the Penal Code, the facts mentioned in the 3rd count, which has

been drafted as a separate count also includes in the 1st count itself, which is a

fact, in my view, should have been considered by the learned High Court Judge

in sentencing the appellants.

Another matter that should have been considered by the learned High Court

Judge, in my view, was the fact that the 4th and the 5th count preferred against

the appellants in terms of the Antiquities Ordinance for causing destruction to

an ancient monument, and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms

Page 11 of 12

of section 15B of the Antiquities Ordinance, refers to the one and the same

offence mentioned in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd count in the indictment.

The difference being that the 1st, 2nd, and the 3rd count under section 410 of the

Penal Code, while the 4th and the 5th count under a separate statute, namely

under the Antiquities Ordinance, which provides for the charging of an accused

under a specific statute for offences alleged to have been committed under the

same corresponding provisions of the Penal Code.

I am of the view that although the appellants have pleaded guilty to all the 5

counts preferred against them, when sentencing, the learned High Court Judge

should have considered the 4th and the 5th count as alternate counts to the 1st,

2nd and 3rd count, since, if not, it would be amounting to sentencing the

appellants twice for the same offence, although under two different statutes.

Under the aforementioned circumstances, I am of the view that sentencing the

appellants to serve the sentences imposed upon them concurrently to each other

would have been the justifiable sentence that should have been passed on them.

Accordingly, I hold that the respective separate jail sentences imposed upon the

accused-appellants shall be served concurrently to each other.

Accordingly, I vary the sentencing order dated 14-12-2023 pronounced by the

learned High Court Judge of Kurunegala by adding the directive that the

sentences imposed upon the accused-appellants shall be served concurrently to

each other.

It was brought to the notice of the Court that although the appellants preferred

this appeal challenging the sentence, they are still under the prison custody as

their bail pending appeal applications have not been taken up for consideration

up until the time this matter was argued.

Hence, acting in terms of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act No.

25 of 2024, it is directed that the period of imprisonment the appellants now

Page 12 of 12

stand to serve shall deem to have commenced from their original date of

conviction by the High Court, namely, from 14-12-2023.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High

Court of Kurunegala along with the original case record after the relevant period

for necessary procedural steps.
