JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

This is an application in Revision preferred by the Hon. Attorney

General challenging the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court

Judge of Ampara on 12.11.2021 against the 1st Accused- Respondent

(Hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent) and the acquittal of the

2nd Accused-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as 2nd Respondent) who

were indicted before the High Court of Ampara.

When this matter was considered, the relevant notices were issued to

the 1st and 2nd Respondents by this Court twice under the registered

cover, but the Respondents have not appeared before this Court and

failed to responded to the notices.

At the very inception, the Learned Deputy Solicitor General

representing the Hon. Attorney General, informed this Court that she is

now not perusing the application for the acquittal of the 2nd

Respondent, but making submissions only with regard to the illegality

of the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court judge of Ampara in

relation to the 1st Respondent after he was found guilty to the offence of

Gang Rape.

The 1st Respondent along with 2nd Respondent were indicted in the High

Court of Ampara on two separate counts of Gang Rape each committed

on Vithanage Somawathie on the 29.10.2011 which is punishable

under Section 364(2) read with section 364(2) (g) of the Penal Code as

amended.

After the conclusion of the full trial, the Learned High Court Judge had

pronounced the Judgment on 05.03.2021. In his judgment he had

acquitted the 2nd Respondent from the 02nd charge and convicted the 1st

Respondent for the 1st charge in the indictment.

The Learned High Court Judge had imposed the following sentence on

the 1st Respondent on 12.11.2021:

10 years rigorous imprisonment suspended for 15 years.

[Emphasis added]

A fine of Rs.30,000/- was imposed with a default sentence of 6

months rigorous imprisonment.

A compensation of Rs.100,000/- was ordered to be paid to the

victim with default sentence of 8 years rigorous

imprisonment. [Emphasis added]

Being aggrieved by the sentence imposed on the 1st Respondent by the

learned High Court Judge of Ampara, the Petitioner had preferred this

Revision application before this Court.

The background of the case briefly as follows:

The victim in this case is a 52-year-old married person with three

children. She was running a small shop near the Mahaoya temple and

was returning home around 5.30-6.00 p.m. after days work, when the

1st and 2nd Respondents who are known persons to her previously

greeted her. After passing short distance, the Respondents having

closed the victims mouth, forcibly dragged her to a shrub area.

Thereafter, the 1st Respondent had raped her and the 2nd Respondent

was stood by the head of the victim. Although the victim had plead to

release her, but the 1st Respondent had threatened to kill her.

Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent had had dragged her to another location

and when he about to suck one of her breasts, seen a flash of a torch

light, the victim was released by the 2nd Respondent.

Upon seeing PW2 and PW3 who had come there after hearing wailing of

the victim, the victim had informed them that the Respondents had

raped her. These witnesses had noted that the buttons of the

prosecutrixs bouse was broken and her body was covered with mud.

The victims pair of sleepers was found on the opposite ends of the

bridge. The witnesses further had observed that the victim was weeping

at that time. After a prompt complaint to the police investigation was

commenced and the Respondents were taken in to police custody by the

police.

The Respondents took up the position that they were drunk and

requested to engage in sexual intercourse with the victim for money.

They had been interrupted by PW2 and PW3 prior to any sexual act

taking place.

CA (PHC)APN 115/22

The offence of Gang Rape was introduced to the Penal Code by the

amendment Act No. 22 of 1995 which was came into operation on

31.10.1995. The punishment for Gang Rape under Section 364(2) of the

Penal Code is stipulated below:

Whoever commits gang rape shall be punished with rigorous

imprisonment for a term of not less than ten years and not

exceeding twenty years. [Empasis added].

The Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself and failed to

address his judicial mind to the Section 364(2) of the Penal Coade as

amended by Act No.22 of 1995 which makes provisions for

enhancement of punishment with a minimum mandatory punishment

of 10 years imprisonment for the offence of Gang rape which is defined

in the Section 364(2) (g) of the Penal Code.

The primary intention of the legislature in enacting the Penal Code

amendment Act. No.22 of 1995 is to bring enhancement of punishment

in the form of a minimum mandatory sentence for Gang Rape to

prevent of sexual exploitation of women and children and protection of

women and children. Hence, statutory provisions enacted by the said

Act should be interpreted and applied in a manner that will give effect

to the intention of the legislature.

When the amendment Act No.22 of 1995 was presented to the

Parliament, Hon. Prof: G.L Peiris- The Minister of Justice and

Constitutional Affairs and Deputy Minister of Finance stated:

We have therefore looked closely at the relevant provisions and we

are asking that they be changed in such a manner as to

enable a far greater degree of protection to be accorded to

vulnerable interests in society, principally in this instance,

women and children.

Even a consensual act of intercourse with a girl below the age of 12

years constitutes rape in accordance with a girl below the Criminal

CA (PHC)APN 115/22

6 | P a g e

Laws of our county. We are now proposing that, that age be

increased from 12 to 16 years. The effect of that provision is that

sexual intercourse with any girl below the age of 16 years, even if the

girl consents, still constitutes rape in our country. I think that is very

necessary. A child of 15 years does not really have the mental

maturity or perception to give consent to an act of sexual

intercourse. The child is not mindful of the gravity of the

consequences attendant upon the physical act of intercourse

and the criminal law should provide protection to that child

by declaring that the act of intercourse per se, whether there is

consent or not, constitutes rape.

It is only maximum penalty that is generally prescribed by penal

legislation. But we think that in certain circumstances the

offences are so severe they damage the fabric of society to

such an extent that the substantive law must prescribe the

minimum penalty.

We have also thought it proper in introduce an enhanced penalty in

circumstances where a girl below the age of 18 years is raped, or

where a pregnant woman is raped, or where a woman mentally

disturbed is raped. In those circumstances not only is there liability

for rape, but, we think, it is also just and equitable that a more

onerous and enhanced punishment be imposed. In the case of

statutory rape, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is minimum penalty of 7

years rigorous imprisonment, but in circumstances where the girl

raped in below 18 years, or is mentally disturbed, or is

pregnant, we are proposing that there should be a mandatory

minimum sentence of imprisonment of 10 years. That again is

necessary to protect the vulnerable interests of women in our

community.

That is restriction of judicial discretion with regard to sentencing.

Where the facts of the offence are established, the court is under a

CA (PHC)APN 115/22

7 | P a g e

duty to impose a minimum sentence ad in this area where we

are dealing with the protection of women and children, we

thin the prescription of minimum penalty is justified in

certain circumstances. [Empasis added].

The validity of a legislation passed by Parliament cannot be called into

question after the stage set out in Article 80(3) of the Constitution. The

said Article reads as follows:

Where a Bill becomes law upon the certificate of the President, or

the Speaker, as the case may be, being endorsed thereon, no

court or tribunal shall inquire into, pronounce upon or in any

manner call in question, the validity of such Act on any ground

whatsoever.

An important bench of five Justices of Supreme Court in Attorney

General and Others v. Sumathipala [2006] 2 SLR 126 held that:

A judge cannot under a thin guise of interpretation usurp the

function of the legislature to achieve a result that the Judge thinks

is desirable in the interests of justice. Therefore, the role of the

judge is to give effect to the expressed intention of Parliament as it

is the bounden duty of any Court and the function of every Judge

to do justice within the stipulated parameters. [Empasis added].

As stated by Salmond, by interpretation or construction is meant, the

process by which the courts seek to ascertain the meaning of the

legislature through the medium of authoritative forms in which it is

expressed.

Interpretation of statutes is the process of ascertain the true meaning of

the words used in a statute. When language is of the statue is clear,

there is no need the rules of Interpretation, But, in certain cases, more

than one meaning may be derived from the same word or sentence. It is

therefore necessary to interpret the statue to find out the real intention

of the statute.

CA (PHC)APN 115/22

8 | P a g e

In this regard, a Constitution Bench of five Judges of the Supreme

Court of India in R.S.Nayak v.A.R.Antulay,AIR 1984 SC 684 has held:

. If the words of the Statute are clear and unambiguous, it is

the plainest duty of the Court to give effect to the natural meaning

of the words used in the provision. The question of construction

arises only in the event of an ambiguity or the plain meaning of the

words used in the Statute would be self-defeating. (para 18)

The purpose of Interpretation of Statutes is to help the Judge to

ascertain the intention of the Legislature-not to control that intention or

to confine it within the limits, which the Judge may deem reasonable or

expedient.

In Tennakoon v. Dissanakayake 50 NLR 403 the court held that:

..the plain meaning of the language of an antiquated statute cannot

be given an extended judicial interpretation so as to cope with modern

methods of corruption.

In Nandasena v Senanayake and Others [1981] 1 SLR 238 the Court

held that:

Statures should be construed, as far as possible, to avoid absurdity

or futility. A statute should be construed in manner to give it validity

rather than invalidity- ut res magis valeat quam pereat.

The judicial decisions cited above and the writings amply demonstrate

that the Court cannot under the guise of interpretation usurp the

intention of the legislature.

In this case, the Learned High Court Judge not imposing a legal

sentence had imposed an illegal sentence. The 1st Respondent was

sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and suspended the same

for 15 years.

CA (PHC)APN 115/22

9 | P a g e

Section 303(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979

states:

(2) A court shall not make an order suspending a sentence of

imprisonment if-

(a) a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment has been

prescribed by law for the offence in respect of which the sentence

is imposed; or

(b) the offender is serving, or is yet to serve, a term of

imprisonment that has not been suspended; or (c) the offence was

committed when the offender was subject to a probation order or

a conditional release or discharge; or

(d) the term of imprisonment the aggregate terms where the

offender is imposed, or of imprisonment Where the offender is

convicted for more than one offence in the same proceedings

exceeds two years.

The Learned High Court Judge not comprehending subsection (a) of

Section 303(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act properly, had

imposed a suspended sentence to an offence of Gang Rape which

requires a minimum mandatory sentence of 10 years.

Next, the Learned High Court Judge has suspended the same for a

period of 15 years which is contradictory to Section 303(2)(d) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act whereas the suspending a sentence

only be imposed when aggregate terms of imprisonment do not exceed

two years.

As the sentence imposed is illegal and contrary to the procedural law, I

first set aside sentence imposed against the 1st Respondent.

Further, the Learned High Court had ordered a compensation of

Rs.100,000/- and in default ordered 08 years rigorous imprisonment.

CA (PHC)APN 115/22

10 | P a g e

The default sentence ordered also not in conformity with Section 291(d)

of the Code of criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

Section 291(d) of CPC states;

the term for which the court directs the offender to be

imprisoned in default of payment of a fine shall not exceed one-

fourth of the term of imprisonment which is the maximum fixed

for the offence if the offence be punishable with imprisonment we

well as fine;

Hence, the default sentence ordered above also set aside.

Rape including Gang Rape is the most heinous crime amongst all

crimes committed on women. Rape not only hurts the soul of women at

the point of crime taking place but it also hurts women socially,

physically, and mentally. After the crime is committed, the life of

women become miserable.

In Dhananjay Chatterjee alias Dhana v State of West Bengal [1194]

2 SCC 220 the Indian Supreme Court held:

15. In our opinion, the measure of punishment in a given case must

depend upon the atrocity of the crime; the conduct of the

criminal and the defenceless and unprotected state of the

victim. Imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which

the courts respond to the society's cry for justice against the

criminals.

Justice demands that courts should impose punishment

befitting the crime so that the courts reflect public abhorrence

of the crime. The courts must not only keep in view the rights

CA (PHC)APN 115/22

11 | P a g e

of the criminal but also the rights of the victim of crime and

the society at large while considering imposition of

appropriate punishment. [Empasis added]

The Learned State Counsel in his sentencing submission highlighting

the prescribed punishment for Gang Rape under Section 364(2) of the

Penal Code as amended, very correctly pleaded the Court to impose an

appropriate and legal sentence on the Respondents. But Learned High

Court Judge disregarding both the submission of the State and the

applicable law, imposed an inappropriate and illegal sentence on the 1st

Respondent which paved the way for him to go free after exploiting poor

and helpless victim. This could not be the intention of the legislature

which considered Gang Rape to be such heinous crime to attract with a

mandatory sentence.

Considering heinous nature of the crime, the Learned High Court Judge

should have imposed stern sentence which not only reflect the ghastly

and inhuman act of the 1st Respondent, but also serves as an example

for the others who might also venture on the same atrocity in future.

In view of the above consideration and discussion, I conclude that an

appropriate and legal sentence is warranted against the 1st Respondent

in this case.

Hence, the 15 years suspended sentence is modified to 10 years

rigorous imprisonment. The fine of Rs.30,000/- with the default

sentence of six months rigorous imprisonment will remain same.

Further, the compensation Rs.100,000/- also will remain same subject

to a default sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment.

Therefore, the revision application allowed subject to above modification

of the sentence.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgment to the

High Court of Ampara.

CA (PHC)APN 115/22

12 | P a g e

The Learned High Court Judge of Ampara is hereby directed to issue

notice on the 1st Respondent to appear before the High Court, as he is

released on a suspended sentence earlier, to comply with this

judgement. Further, the sentence will come into operation on the day it

is communicated to the 1st Respondent.
