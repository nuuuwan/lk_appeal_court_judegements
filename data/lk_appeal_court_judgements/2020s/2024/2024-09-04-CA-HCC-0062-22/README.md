Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Ratnapura for causing the death of one Ayagama

Pitadeniyalage Jayaweera at a place called Pallekada (Ayagama) within the

jurisdiction of the High Court of Ratnapura, on or about 29-12-2011, and

thereby committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms of section 296 of

the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura, of his

judgment dated 10-12-2021 found the appellant guilty for culpable homicide not

amounting to murder in terms of section 294 exception 4 of the Penal Code, and

convicted him in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code.

After having considered the mitigatory as well as the aggravating circumstances,

the learned High Court Judge sentenced the appellant on the basis of the 1st

limb of section 297 for a period of 12 years rigorous imprisonment. He was

ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 15,000/-, and in default, to serve 6 months simple

imprisonment. The appellant was also ordered to pay Rs. 300,000/- as

Page 3 of 14

compensation to the wife of the deceased, namely PW-01, and in default of such

payment, he was ordered to serve 1-year simple imprisonment.

On the basis of being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the

appellant preferred this appeal.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant submitted

the following grounds of appeal for consideration of the Court.

1. The learned High Court Judge has caused grave miscarriage of justice

to the accused-appellant by failing to give due consideration and

importance to the right of private defence exercised by the accused-

appellant.

2. The judgment of the learned High Court Judge is contrary and in excess

to law.

Before considering the grounds of appeal urged and the submissions made in

that regard, I would like to narrate the evidence led at the trial in brief, for the

better understanding of the judgment.

Evidence in Brief

According to the evidence of PW-01, who was the wife of the deceased, her

husband along with her son had been filling compost fertilizer to plastic bags

from their compost pit situated near the boundary that separated the land of

theirs from their neighbour in order to grow vegetables. The time was around

2.30 in the afternoon of 29-12-2011. They have been using a mamoty and an

iron rod for this purpose. The witness had been seated nearby and was observing

what they were doing.

The evidence of PW-01 establishes the fact that there had been a dispute over

the common boundary of their neighbour during the relevant period. While they

were engaged in this task, the mother of the appellant, namely Punyawathi, has

come and informed her husband not to dig at the place they were digging for

compost, claiming that portion of land as theirs.

Page 4 of 14

This has led to a verbal altercation between them and as a result, the deceased

has stated that we will be going to the police. At that point, the appellant has

come and gotten involved in the dispute and had cut the filled fertilizer packets

using the kathy knife (billhook knife) he brought along with him. Thereafter, PW-

01 has also gotten involved, and in the ensuing brawl, the earlier mentioned

Punyawathi has started assaulting the PW-01. She has fallen onto the ground

as a result, and she has heard her husbands sister who was in the house with

them shouting, and has seen the appellant jumping towards her husband who

was near her, pointing the kathy knife towards him.

She has not seen the appellant attacking her husband, but has seen her

husband falling onto the ground while holding his head.

According to her evidence, after the assault on her husband, the appellant has

taken his sister Tekla, who had also been there and had left. She has later come

to know that her husband has succumbed to his injuries at the hospital.

Under cross-examination, she has stated that she did not know that there was

a case against her husband for causing injuries to the earlier mentioned Tekla,

but has stated that she saw Tekla been injured after her husband was attacked

by the appellant, although she did not see how those injuries occurred to her.

The position taken on behalf of the appellant at the cross-examination had been

that he came to the scene in order to protect the life of Tekla, which the witness

has answered saying she is unaware of that fact.

The PW-02 has been the son, who was working with the deceased at the time the

incident occurred. His evidence had been to the effect that, he and his father

filled compost fertilizer to bags using the iron rod and the mamoty they had with

them. While they were engaged in that task, the earlier mentioned Punyawathi

and Tekla had come and scolded the deceased telling him not to get fertilizer

from that spot, which has resulted in a verbal altercation between the deceased

and the two females.

Page 5 of 14

At that point, the appellant who came there has cut the fertilizer bags, which

were already filled, using the kathy knife he was carrying. At that point, the

deceased has said that they are going to the police.

While this was going on, he has seen the earlier mentioned Punyawathi and Tekla

attacking his mother (PW-01). He has also seen the appellant attacking the

deceased using the kathy knife he was carrying. As a result, his father, the

deceased, had fallen onto the ground while holding onto his head. He has also

stated that while the appellant was attacking his father, the earlier mentioned

Tekla also came there and she attempted to restrain on the appellant.

According to his evidence, he has not seen anyone else being injured, but has

come to know that his father has died at the hospital as a result of the injuries

sustained by him.

It has been suggested to the witness when he was under cross-examination that

he was lying when he stated that the earlier mentioned Tekla attempted to

prevent the deceased being attacked by the appellant, which the witness has

denied. It has also been suggested that it was after his father attacked Tekla, the

appellant attacked him in order to rescue Tekla from his father, which has also

been denied by the witness.

PW-05 Gamini Wasantha Kumara has seen the appellant with the earlier

mentioned Tekla while the appellant was carrying a kathy knife a few minutes

after the incident. He has also seen the appellant holding Tekla who had an

injury on her head. Both of them have come and had sat near a boutique situated

nearby and the witness has seen the appellant going behind the boutique with

the kathy knife he was carrying. Later, he has assisted the police to recover the

said kathy knife.

According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted

the post-mortem, the deceased had received one serious cut injury to his head,

which has resulted in his death. After the evidence of the police officers who

conducted the relevant investigations, the prosecution has closed its case and

Page 6 of 14

the learned High Court Judge, based on the evidence led before the Court, has

called for a defence from the appellant. The appellant has decided to make a

dock statement. He has called the earlier mentioned Tekla, who was his sister

as a witness, and has also called the JMO who examined the earlier mentioned

Tekla after she was admitted to the hospital to testify on his behalf.

The appellant in his dock statement has stated that while he was at home, he

heard a quarrel near the common boundary between their land and the land of

the deceased. When he ran towards the place where the quarrel was taking place,

he has seen the deceased with a mamoty in his hand and his son having an iron

rod with him. He has also seen the wife of the deceased (PW-01) with a kathy

knife in her hand. While he was approaching the scene, the deceased has

attacked his sister Tekla, who was also there, using the mamoty he was holding.

After receiving a blow to her head, she has fallen and the appellant has attempted

to prevent the deceased from attacking his sister by trying to get hold of the

mamoty the deceased had in his hand.

He has claimed that at that point, the wife of the deceased came with a kathy

knife shouting I will kill you and as he had no option, he grabbed hold of the

kathy knife and attacked the deceased.

After that, he has taken his sister away and had taken steps to admit her to the

hospital. He has surrendered to the Court after coming to know that Jayaweera,

who was the deceased, has passed away. He has claimed that he only acted in

order to rescue his mother and sister, since he had no other option and he also

feared that he would be killed.

The evidence of Tekla Nishanthi Fonseka, who was the sister of the appellant,

had been to the same effect, and her position had been that when she and her

mother protested the actions of the deceased and his son, the deceased attacked

her using the mamoty he was holding. She has claimed that the wife of the

deceased attacked her mother at the same time. Her evidence had been that it

was she who had a kathy knife at that time and she swung the kathy knife when

Page 7 of 14

the deceased attempted to attack her for the 2nd time. At that time, she has

received another blow towards her back, and after that, because of the blood on

her face, she could not see anything and had fallen unconscious, and regained

consciousness only at the hospital.

She has claimed that her brother has come to her rescue after seeing her and

her mother being attacked, and if not for her brother, she would have been killed.

On behalf of the defence, the JMO who examined the defence witness Tekla has

been called to give evidence. The said JMO has confirmed that the witness Tekla

has received head injuries. The defence has also called an official from the

Magistrates Court of Ratnapura to confirm that the police have filed a B-Report

informing of the incident where Tekla had also received injuries.

The Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

Although two grounds of appeal were raised by the learned Counsel for the

appellant, I will now proceed to consider them together as they are interrelated.

The main contention of the learned Counsel in arguing this appeal was that the

appellant had acted exercising his right of private defence in order to save his

sister from being attacked by the deceased. It was his view that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to give consideration to his defence, and the judgment of

the learned High Court Judge was contrary to law in that regard.

It is settled law that if a person can establish that he acted in exercising his right

of private defence, such an action cannot be considered as an action that

constitutes an offence.

The relevant section 89 and 90 of the Penal Code relevant to this incident reads

as follows.

89. Nothing is an offence which is done in exercise of the right of

private defence.

Page 8 of 14

90. Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in

section 92, to defend

Firstly His own body and the body of any other person, against

any other offence affecting the human body;

Secondly The property, whether movable or immovable, of

himself or of any other person, against any act which is an

offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief,

or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft,

robbery, mischief, or criminal trespass.

(Section 92 referred to above describes the acts against which there is no

right of private defence)

When an accused takes up the position that he acted in exercising his right of

private defence, it falls within the category of taking up the position it falls within

the general exceptions in the Penal Code. In such a scenario, proving of such

circumstances is upon the accused who takes up such a position. In my view,

although no burden of proof lies with an accused person in a criminal case, when

such an accused takes up a position as mentioned earlier, that burden shifts to

the accused only in relation to his position, and it would not extend beyond

establishing that fact.

The relevant section 105 of the Evidence Ordinance reads as follows;

105. When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving

the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the

general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception

or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any

law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume

the absence of such circumstances.

Page 9 of 14

In view of the above statutory provisions, I find no basis for the learned Counsels

contention that the learned High Court Judge has failed to give due consideration

to the appellants defence taken up at the trial on the basis of exercising the right

of private defence.

On the contrary, I find that the learned High Court Judge was very much mindful

of the legal requirements that should be established if the appellant is to succeed

in his defence. With that in mind, the learned High Court Judge has well

considered the evidence placed before the Court by the prosecution, as well as

the dock statement and the evidence given on behalf of the appellant when he

was called upon for a defence.

The evidence placed before the Court clearly suggests that this was a dispute

that arose as a result of the deceased and his son collecting compost fertilizer

near the common boundary between the houses of the deceased and the

appellant. It is clear that due to the dispute, inmates of the appellants house

have come and protested against the actions of the deceased and his son, which

has resulted in a brawl.

The appellants position had been that when he heard the commotion, he came

to the place of the incident and saw his sister being attacked by the deceased

using a mamoty. He has claimed in his dock statement that it was the wife of the

deceased who carried a kathy knife. His position had been that he was forced to

attack the deceased in order to rescue her when the deceased attempted to attack

his sister for the 2nd time.

On behalf of the appellant, his sister who has also sustained injuries in the

incident has given evidence. According to her version of events, it was she who

had brought the kathy knife. She has claimed that when the deceased was

attempting to attack her with the mamoty, she swung the kathy knife she had

in order to escape him, which appears to be a suggestion of claiming that the

injuries caused to the deceased may have been a result of her actions.

Page 10 of 14

At the same time, when PW-02, the son of the deceased was giving evidence, the

suggestion made on behalf of the appellant had been that the kathy knife was a

one that was in the house of the deceased. The learned High Court Judge has

considered all these pieces of evidence in much more detail in his judgment in

order to determine whether it has been established that the death of the deceased

was a result of exercising the right of private defence by the appellant.

In that process, the learned High Court Judge has brought to his attention

several decided cases cited before the High Court as well. The learned High Court

Judge has determined that this is an incident where the appellant has clearly

exceeded his right of private defence and he is not entitled to rely on such a

defence, and had rejected his contention.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant submitted

that although the prosecution witnesses claimed that the appellant cut and

destroyed the fertilizer bags filled by the deceased before he attacked him, the

police officers who conducted investigations has not seen such a destruction.

I am of the view that although no evidence has been given by the investigating

police officer as to such an observation, it is clear that when PW-01 and 02 gave

evidence and stated that fact, it has not been challenged or contradicted in any

manner. Therefore, that piece of evidence has to be considered as unchallenged

evidence. As considered aforesaid, I find no reason to disagree with the findings

of the learned High Court Judge, which I find to be determinations reached after

well considering the evidence and the relevant law in that regard.

After determining as to the defence taken up by the appellant, the learned High

Court Judge has very correctly considered that although no such position had

been taken up at the trial, whether the evidence establishes a sufficient basis to

determine the incident, and the actions of the appellant, constitutes culpable

homicide not amounting to murder.

It is trite law that when an accused person is charged for the offence of murder

punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code, even in a situation where

Page 11 of 14

no such position has been taken up by the defence, it is the duty of the trial

Judge to consider whether the incident where the accused person has caused

the death of the deceased amounts to culpable homicide not amounting to

murder in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered all the facts and

circumstances placed before him and had determined that this is a matter where

the appellant should be convicted in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code under

exception 4 of the section 294.

The relevant exception 4 reads as follows.

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel and unusual manner.

Explanation It is immaterial in such cases which party offers

the provocation or commits the first assault.

I am of the view that this was the determination that could have been reached

under the given facts and the circumstances, and hence, I find no reason to

interfere with the determination of the learned High Court Judge in that regard.

It needs to be emphasized that this is a matter where the same learned High

Court Judge who pronounced the judgment has heard the evidence of the case

in its entirety. As a result, the learned High Court Judge has had the full benefit

of observing the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses, which is an

invaluable advantage he has had in determining the case before him.

It is settled law that under such circumstances, the appellate Courts would be

hesitant to interfere with such a judgment unless the determinations of the

learned High Court Judge were contrary to the evidence placed before the Court

and against the law.

Page 12 of 14

In the case of De Silva and Others Vs. The Attorney General (2010) 2 SLR

169, it was held that;

Credibility is a question of fact, not law. Appeal Court Judges repeatedly

stress the importance of trial Judges observation of demeanor of witnesses

in deciding questions of fact. The acceptance or rejection of evidence is

therefore is a question of fact for the trial Judge, since he or she is in the

best position to hear and observe witnesses. In such a situation the

appellate Courts will be slow to interfere with the findings of a trial Judge

unless such evidence could be shown to be totally inconsistent or perverse

and lacking credibility. Evidence must be weighed and not counted.

In the case of Chaminda Vs. The Republic (2009) 1 SLR 144, it was held:

An appellate Court will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial Judge who

has come to a favourable finding with regard to the testimonial

trustworthiness of a witness whose demeanor and deportment had been

observed by a trial Judge. Findings of primary facts by a trial Judge who

hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on appeal.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no basis to interfere with the

judgment dated 10-12-2021 by the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura.

Accordingly, the appeal against the conviction is dismissed for want of merit.

However, when it comes to the sentencing of the appellant under section 297 of

the Penal Code on the basis of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, it

appears that the learned High Court Judge has acted in terms of the 1st limb of

section 297.

When a person is convicted in terms of section 297, the punishment that can be

imposed on such a person has to be determined under the two limbs mentioned

in the section.

Page 13 of 14

For better understanding, I would now reproduce section 297 of the Penal Code,

which reads as follows:

297. Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder

shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term

which may extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine, if

the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of

causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause

death;

or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with

the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any

intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to

cause death.

I find that in the judgment, the learned High Court Judge has clearly determined

the fact when the appellant attacked the deceased with a kathy knife, he has

had no murderous intention or has not acted in a cruel or unusual manner, but

this was an incident that happened due to the sudden fight or a quarrel. He has

also determined that the appellant has acted exceeding his right of private

defence.

It is my considered view that under such circumstances, the sentence imposed

upon the appellant should have been in terms of the 2nd limb of section 297

where the period of imprisonment can only be extended for a period of 10 years.

Therefore, I set aside the period of 12 years rigorous imprisonment imposed upon

the appellant, and replace it with a period of 9 years rigorous imprisonment.

However, the fine imposed, the compensation ordered, and the default sentences

imposed shall remain the same.

Page 14 of 14

The appeal against the sentence is partially allowed subjected to the above

variation as to the period of rigorous imprisonment.

Since the appellant is on bail pending appeal, it is directed that his sentence

shall commence from the day where the learned High Court Judge of Ratnapura

pronounces this judgment to him before the High Court of Ratnapura.
