The Petitioner Company has filed this Writ Application seeking to quash

the orders contained in the letters marked P-21 and P-23. P-21 is a letter

dated 13.01.2020, sent by the 4th Respondent to the Petitioner informing

that the loan granted to the 3rd Respondent by the Petitioner cannot be

recovered from the Employees Provident Fund and to present a cheque in

favour of the 3rd Respondent for a sum of Rs. 639,575.09 to their office

within two weeks. P23 is a notice dated 05.02.2022, sent by the 2nd

Respondent informing the Petitioner to draw a cheque in favour of the 3rd

Respondent for the recovery of a sum of Rs. 639,575.09 and the interest

thereon as the Petitioner had not truly granted a loan to the 3rd

Respondent.

The 3rd Respondent was the Branch Manager of Sisil World Showroom,

Mathugama of the Petitioner Company. When losses in the said outlet

managed by the 3rd Respondent were discovered by the Petitioner, the 3rd

Respondent requested by the letter marked P8-(4) that Rs.600,000/- to be

utilized from his security deposit to settle a part of the outstanding dues

to the Petitioner. The Petitioner stated that his request had to be rejected,

as the security deposit had already been utilized to settle part of the

outstanding dues.

According to the Petitioner, initially, they found only a loss but later it was

found that it was a fraud. Then, a show cause letter was issued to the 3rd

Respondent on 31.03.2017 and a domestic inquiry was held. As per the

Letter of Termination marked P8-(3) dated 13.07.2017, the 3rd

Respondents service was terminated upon being found guilty of all the

charges brought against him. A District Court case has also been filed

against the 3rd Respondent to recover the balance sum of Rs.3,811,345.30

allegedly misappropriated by him, the case has been heard ex-parte, and

Page 4 of 15

the Judgment (Y-2) has been delivered in favour of the Plaintiff after this

application was filed.

After the 3rd Respondents request that Rs.600,000/- be utilized from his

security deposit to settle a part of the outstanding dues was rejected, the

3rd Respondent requested and entered into a loan agreement with the

Petitioner in respect of a sum of Rs.600,000.00/- in order to settle a

portion of a loss caused by him to the Petitioner while he was working as

a Branch Manager of a showroom of the Petitioner Company. This

agreement contains a specific clause that if the 3rd Respondent fails to

settle the said loan by reason of death, retirement, resignation, or

termination on or before the settlement date of the loan, the Petitioner

Company shall be entitled to recover the balance sum outstanding on the

loan by way of a claim under Section 43 of the Rules of the Mercantile

Services Provident Society; an unincorporated entity and a Private

Provident Fund approved by the 1st Respondent and established by the 5th

Respondent. (Clause 4 of the Loan Agreement)

After entering into the said loan agreement, the Petitioner suspended the

service of the 3rd Respondent because of several acts of misconduct related

to mismanagement of cash and hire purchase collection at the aforesaid

showroom. Upon termination, the Petitioner has recovered the sum of

Rs.600,000/- from the money lying to the credit of the 3rd Respondent in

the Mercantile Services Provident Society (hereinafter referred to as

MSPS). The 3rd Respondent thereafter made a complaint to the

Department of Labour on 16.02.2017 (P-2) that his service was suspended

without preliminary inquiry and requested an order to grant EPF, ETF,

Compensation, and a letter of resignation. The Petitioner stated that an

inquiry was held in respect of the said complaint, but no order was given.

Page 5 of 15

Again, the 3rd Respondent made a complaint to the 1st Respondent on

20.11.2017 (P-4(A)). In the said complaint, the 3rd Respondent stated that

his service was wrongfully terminated on 14.02.2017 and requested an

order to pay his EPF, on the basis that remitting a sum of Rs.639,575.09

to the account of the Petitioner Company from his EPF is unjustifiable. An

inquiry was held regarding the said complaint. Thereafter, the 4th

Respondent conveyed to the Petitioner, the Order marked P-21 and

subsequently, the 2nd Respondent conveyed to the Petitioner, the Order

marked P-23. The Petitioner Company challenges these two orders in this

Writ Application.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner, and the learned Deputy Solicitor

General for the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Respondents, made oral submissions at

the hearing of this application. The 5th Respondent was also represented

at the hearing. The 3rd Respondent was not present and he was not

represented. Written submissions have been filed on behalf of the

Petitioner and on behalf of the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Respondents.

The issue to be determined in this application is whether the Petitioner

Company is legally entitled to recover the loan granted to the 3rd

Respondent by the Petitioner from the money lying to the 3rd Respondents

credit in the Mercantile Services Provident Society. (hereinafter referred to

as MSPS) Fund.

On 13.01.2020, the 4th Respondent informed the Petitioner by the letter

P-21 that the loan granted to the 3rd Respondent by the Petitioner could

not be recovered from the EPF and therefore, to draw a cheque in favour

of the 3rd Respondent for a sum of Rs.639,575.09. On 05.02.2021, the 2nd

Respondent informed the Petitioner by the letter P-23 that the loan granted

by the Petitioner Company was not truly a loan released to the 3rd

Page 6 of 15

Respondent and therefore, to draw a cheque in favour of the 3rd

Respondent for a sum of Rs.639,575.09. So, the Petitioner Company has

been directed by the aforementioned two letters to draw a cheque in favour

of the 3rd Respondent for a sum of Rs.639,575.09 on two different grounds.

Firstly, it was informed that the loan granted to the 3rd Respondent by the

Petitioner could not be recovered from the EPF. Secondly, it was informed

that the loan granted by the Petitioner Company was not truly a loan

released to the 3rd Respondent.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner contended that MSPS is the oldest

approved Private Provident Fund in the country and not only the Petitioner

Company but across the mercantile sector who are members of the MSPS

grant loans to their employees against a lien as specified in Rule 43 of the

MSPS, where the balance of the loan at the time of termination of

employment can be recovered. Furthermore, the learned Counsel

submitted that these Rules have been approved by the Commissioner of

Labour as per Section 27 of the EPF Act. Therefore, he contended that the

Petitioner has recovered the loan granted to the 3rd Respondent from MSPS

Funds in accordance with the law and the decisions contained in P-23 and

P-21 are bad in law.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondents (the 1st, 2nd, and

4th Respondents are referred to as Respondents) contended that the

Petitioner Company has engaged in corrupt, oppressive, and exploitative

practices to punish and harass their employees. He contended that

although in terms of the Payment of Gratuity Act, the employer can forfeit

the gratuity of an employee whose service has been terminated as a result

of fraud, there is no comparable provision in the Employes Provident Fund

Act. Hence, he submitted that even though an employee causes damage

or loss to the company, the employer cannot withhold the payment of the

Page 7 of 15

employees EPF benefits. It is stated in paragraph 15 of the statement of

objections that Rule 43 of the Mercantile Service Provident Society is

inconsistent with the provisions of the EPF Act and cannot be given effect.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General further contended that it seems that

the Petitioner was pushing the workman to take a loan from the company,

enabling the workman to compensate for the losses he is alleged to have

caused, which is an unusual and strange arrangement. The learned DSG

submitted that there was no actual fund transfer in granting the loan, and

this is an instance where delictual liability is being repackaged as a

contractual liability.

The learned DSG submitted that there was no actual fund transfer. The

2nd Respondent informed the Petitioner that the loan granted by the

Petitioner Company was not truly a loan released to the 3rd Respondent.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that if the Petitioner applies

Rule 43, there must be an actual loan agreement. He contended that a

loan agreement is a contract; to formulate a contract, there must be an

offer and acceptance, and a consideration. Consideration, he submitted is

essentially money or something of value, which is given in exchange for

either goods or services or for a promise to refrain from doing something.

The learned DSG contended that in this loan agreement, as no

consideration was passed to the workman, there was no loan agreement,

and as such, the refusal to pay the EPF benefit on the basis that the same

has been used to recover the loan is illegal.

I agree with the legal position regarding a contract described by the learned

DSG while submitting the relevant judicial authorities. However, for the

following reasons, I am unable to agree with his argument in relation to

the Loan Agreement marked P8-(6):

Page 8 of 15

Firstly; The 3rd Respondent did not come to this Court and stated that he

was pushed to take a loan. It is apparent that the 3rd Respondent in his

own handwriting, filled up the Loan Application Form and requested a loan

of Rs.600,000/-. Thus, the other Respondents cannot state that the 3rd

Respondent was pushed to take a loan or obtaining this loan was an

unusual and strange arrangement.

In the written submission submitted on 27.02.2018, by the 3rd Respondent

(P-10) at the inquiry held in the Labour Department, the Respondent has

stated that he could not understand the language in which the Loan

Agreement P8-(6) (he referred to as the document R-(6) was written. The

3rd Respondent was the Branch Manager of the Sisil World Showroom of

the Singer Sri Lanka PLC (the Petitioner Company). The Petitioner stated

that as the Branch Manager, he had to enter into many hire purchase

contracts for consumer goods, that are generally in English Language. P8-

(6) is not a complicated, lengthy agreement. It contains only 5 clauses. It

cannot be believed that a Branch Manager of the Singer Company, who

has perfected and tendered the loan application (P8-(5)) in his own

handwriting in English cannot understand the five clauses contained in

the Loan Agreement. Furthermore, until the said written submission is

filed, the 3rd Respondent has never complained that his signature was

obtained on a document that was in a language that he did not

understand. In addition, the 3rd Respondent has not come to this Court

and stated that his signature was obtained on the Lease Agreement which

was in English and he could not understand the contents therein.

Secondly; the 3rd Respondent acknowledged the receipt of a sum of

Rs.600,000/- by the Petitioner Company by signing the Loan Agreement

P8-(6). Section 91 and Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance read as

follows:

Page 9 of 15

Section 91 of the Evidence Ordinance reads:

Evidence of terms of contracts, grants or other disposition of property

reduced to form of document. - When the terms of a contract, or a grant, or

of any other disposition of property have been reduced by or by consent of

the parties to the form of a document, and in all cases in which any matter

is required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, no evidence shall

be given in proof of the terms of such contract, grant or other disposition of

property, or of such matter, except the document itself, or secondary

evidence of its contents in cases in which secondary evidence is admissible

under the provisions herein before contained.

Section 92 of the Evidence Ordinance reads;

When the terms of any such grant or other disposition of property or any

matter required by law to be reduced to the form of a document have been

proved according to the last Section, no evidence of any oral agreement or

statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument

or their representatives in interest, for the purpose of contradicting, varying,

adding to or subtracting from its terms.

After reproducing the aforementioned two sections in the Evidence

Ordinance, it is stated in the Judgment of Dangolla Appuhamilage

Wimalawathie V. Dankoluwa Hewa Bulath Kandage Dona Subashini

Ruchira Manjari - SC Appeal 167/10, SC/HC(CA)/LA/195/09, decided

on 14.03.2017, that in simple language, the aforementioned provisions of

the Evidence Ordinance provides that if two or more parties get together

and sign a legal document with terms and conditions contained therein,

binding each party, then, the same parties cannot give oral evidence to

contradict the contents of the written document. Section 92 clearly

excludes any oral evidence to vary, add, subtract, or contradict what is

included in the legally signed document.

Page 10 of 15

In the instant application, the Loan Agreement marked P8-(6) has been

reduced to a form of a document with the consent of the 3rd Respondent

and the Petitioner Company. In addition, an agreement of this nature is

required by law to be reduced to the form of a document. Therefore, the

3rd Respondent cannot give oral evidence, taking up a contrary position to

what is in the Loan Agreement and state that he has not truly obtained

the loan. In fact, as stated previously, the 3rd Respondent has not come to

this Court and said so. In addition, when the 3rd Respondent applied for

the loan, he has specifically stated in the loan application that he

requested the loan in order to clear short remittance. In the

circumstances, other Respondents cannot argue that the loan was actually

not given to the 3rd Respondent or there was no actual fund transfer. The

2nd Respondent was also erred in deciding that the loan granted by the

Petitioner Company was not truly a loan released to the 3rd Respondent

and directing the Petitioner to draw a cheque in favour of the 3rd

Respondent for the recovery of a sum of Rs. 639,575.09 and the interest

thereon.

Considering the aforementioned facts, it is apparent that the 3rd

Respondent entered into a Loan Agreement with the Petitioner Company

and acknowledged receipt of the loan in the amount of Rs.600,000/-. The

petitioner recovered the loan granted to the 3rd Respondent from the MSPS

Funds as per Rule 43 of the MSPS.

Now, I consider whether the Petitioner Company can legally act upon the

rules of the Mercantile Services Provident Society Fund in respect of the

EPF of its employees.

Page 11 of 15

Section 27 of the Employees Provident Fund Act reads as follows:

27(1) Where a provident fund or a contributory pension scheme has been

established before the appointed date for the benefit of any employees

in a covered employment, the administrators of such fund or scheme

shall, within three months after the declaration of that employment as

a covered employment by regulation made under this Act, furnish the

Commissioner with the prescribed particulars relating to such fund or

scheme, and, if the Commissioner, after examining such particulars

and making such investigations as he may deem necessary, is of the

opinion that such fund or scheme satisfies the prescribed

requirements and that it is expedient that such fund or scheme should

be declared to be an approved provident fund or an approved

contributory pension scheme, he shall declare such fund or scheme to

be an approved provident fund or an approved contributory pension

scheme; and, if he so declares, no contributions shall, with effect from

the date fixed in relation to such fund or scheme, be payable to the

Fund by such employees and the employer of such employees.

27(2) The employer in a covered employment who proposes to establish,

after the appointed date, a provident fund for the employees in such

employment shall furnish the Commissioner with the prescribed

particulars relating to the proposed provident fund, and, if after

examining such particulars and making such investigations as he

may deem necessary, the Commissioner is of opinion that the

proposed provident fund satisfies the prescribed requirements and

that it is expedient that such fund should be declared to be an

approved provident fund, the Commissioner shall declare the

proposed provident fund to be an approved provident fund ; and, if he

so declares and the provident fund is established, contributions to the

Employees' Provident Fund shall, with effect from the date fixed in

Page 12 of 15

relation to such approved provident fund by the Commissioner, cease

to be payable by such employees and such employer.

Hence, it is apparent that Section 27 of the EPF Act permits the

Commissioner of Labour to approve a Private Provident Fund, if the

Commissioner is satisfied after examining and investigating the

particulars of the fund that such fund satisfies the prescribed

requirements. The document Z-1, which was tendered with the counter

affidavit proves that MSPS Provident Fund is an approved Provident

Fund. Therefore, the Petitioner Company is legally entitled to act in terms

of the MSPS Provident Fund when dealing with all matters relating to its

Employees Provident Fund.

At this juncture, it is important to pay attention to Rule 43 of the

Mercantile Services Provident Society as well. Rule 43 is as follows:

The contributor for the time being in respect of a member shall subject

to the provisions of Rule 40 have a lien (a) in the case of a loan granted

prior to the 20th July 1959 on the full amount, and (b) in the case of a

loan granted after 20th July 1959 on seventy-five per centum (75%) of the

amount standing to the credit of a member in respect of contributions

made by that contributor to the member and interest (if any) on such

loan. On the member ceasing to be employed by that contributor or on

the member becoming entitled to receive payment from the Society or on

the death of the member (whichever shall be the earliest of such events),

and on receipt of a certificate from the contributor as to the amount due

in respect of the money so lent, the committee shall after deducting the

amount outstanding on any loan made by the Society under Rule 40

to that member payout of the balance standing to the credit of the

member in the register the amount due to the contributor: In the event

of such balance being insufficient to meet the contributors claim the full

Page 13 of 15

amount of such balance shall be paid to the contributor. The

contributors receipt for the moneys so paid shall be a good discharge to

the committee as against the member or any person claiming through or

under him. (emphasis added)

According to Rule 43, the amount outstanding on any loan can be

deducted from the MSPS Provident Fund. What the Petitioner Company

has done was, recovering the amount outstanding from the loan granted

to the 3rd Respondent in terms of Rule 43 of the MSPS Fund.

Undoubtedly, the payment of EPF to the employees by the employer is

mandatory. But in the case at hand, it is not a refusal to pay EPF as

contended by the learned DSG. The 3rd Respondent applied for the loan

to clear short remittances, the loan was granted, the Petitioner then

recovered the amount outstanding from the loan according to the

provisions of the MSPS.

By signing the Loan Agreement marked P8-(6), the 3rd Respondent agreed

as per clause 4 of the agreement that if he fails to settle the loan by reason

of his death, retirement, resignation, or termination of his service on or

before the settlement date mentioned in the agreement, the company shall

be entitled to recover the balance sum outstanding on the loan by way of

a claim under Section 43 (Employers Lien) of the Rules of the Mercantile

Services Provident Society. Hence, I hold that the Petitioner Company

recovered the loan from the MSPS Fund lawfully, and the Petitioner

Company is legally entitled to do so. When the Petitioner Company

recovered the loan in a lawful manner, it is incorrect for the Respondents

to allege that the Petitioner engaged in a corrupt, oppressive, and

exploitative practice to punish and harass the 3rd Respondent. In the

domestic inquiry, the 3rd Respondent was found guilty of all the charges

Page 14 of 15

leveled against him. After filing this application, the District Court made

an order to recover the balance sum of Rs.3,811,345.30 allegedly

misappropriated by the 3rd Respondent. When a loss was initially

discovered by the Petitioner, the 3rd Respondent requested by letter P8-(4)

which has been written in his handwriting to utilize Rs.600,000/-from his

security deposit. After the Petitioner rejected his request, as the security

deposit was already utilized to settle part of the outstanding, the 3rd

Respondent requested this loan, filling out the loan application in his

handwriting. In the said application, he has specifically stated that the

reason for requesting the loan is to clear short remittances. Under these

circumstances, The Petitioner recovered the loan acting in terms of Rule

43 of the Mercantile Services Provident Society.

Therefore, the 4th Respondents direction contained in P-21 to draw a

cheque in favour of the 3rd Respondent for a sum of Rs.639,575.09, as the

loan granted to the 3rd Respondent by the Petitioner cannot be recovered

from the EPF is erred in law. Further, the 2nd Respondents direction

contained in P-23 to draw a cheque in favour of the 3rd Respondent for a

sum of Rs.639,575.09 as the loan granted by the Petitioner Company was

not truly a loan released to the 3rd Respondent is also erred in law because

the 3rd Respondent himself has acknowledged the receipt of a sum of

Rs. 600,000/- by signing the Loan Agreement P8-(6). Therefore, orders

P-21 and P-23 are illegal and liable to be quashed.

Accordingly, a Writ of Certiorari is issued as prayed for in the prayer (b) of

the petition quashing the orders contained in the letters marked P-23 and

P-21. Parties should bear their own costs.
