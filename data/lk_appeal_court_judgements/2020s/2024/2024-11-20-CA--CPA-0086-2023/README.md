Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application preferred by the 2nd accused-petitioner-petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction granted to this Court in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution.

When this matter was supported for notice, after having considered the relevant

facts, circumstances and the law, this Court issued notices on the respondent-

respondents mentioned in the application. Accordingly, the respondents were

represented and were allowed to file objections, if necessary.

At the hearing of this application, this Court heard the submissions of the

learned Presidents Counsel in support of the application, as well as the

submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG), who represented the

1st complainant-respondent-respondent, and the Hon. Attorney General.

It was agreed by the parties that this matter could be considered along with case

number CPA-0085-23 filed before this Court, as both the applications have been

based on similar facts and circumstances.

This is a matter where the petitioner was charged together with the 1st accused

named in the charge sheet, who is Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC, before the

Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura under Case Number 94696 on the basis

Page 6 of 15

that they violated section 34(1)(a) and/or section 34(1)(b) of the National

Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act No. 27 of 2006 as amended by the

Amendment Act No. 3 of 2015 (hereinafter referred to as the NATA Act).

The 1st complainant-respondent-respondent is an Authorized Officer appointed

in terms of the Act, and also a Public Health Inspector attached to the Municipal

Council of Colombo.

The allegation against the petitioner and the other accused had been to the effect

that they failed to display the required pictorial warnings in terms of the NATA

Act on the large cardboard boxes, in which cigarette packets produced by the 1st

accused charged before the Magistrates Court, were transported for distribution.

The facts mentioned in the petition filed before this Court and also the

submissions made by the learned Presidents Counsel reveals that, as soon as

the 1st complainant-respondent-respondent, who was a Public Health Inspector

attached to the Municipal Council of Colombo, initiated proceedings against the

petitioner before the Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura, the petitioner, along

with the other accused have filed an application before the Court of Appeal under

the Case No. CA/WRT/492/2015, seeking a writ of certiorari to quash the

charges filed against them on the basis that the 1st complainant-respondent-

respondent has initiated proceedings against them on a wrong interpretation of

the requirements of the NATA Act.

It had been contended before the Court of Appeal that NATA Act does not require

the cardboard boxes, in which the petitioner transported cigarette packets

manufactured by the Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC, to have the required

pictorial warning.

The Court of Appeal has initially issued a stay order suspending the proceedings

before the Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura until the final conclusion of the

application before the Court. However, the Court of Appeal, of the judgment

dated 12-09-2019, has dismissed the said Writ Application. The Leave to Appeal

Page 7 of 15

Application seeking to challenge the said order before the Supreme Court has

also been dismissed without leave being granted.

It is clear from the judgment pronounced by Mahinda Samayawardhena, J. in

CA/WRT/492/2015 decided on 12-09-2019, the argument of the petitioners

in the said Writ Application had been that section 34 of the NATA Act as amended

does not require the cardboard boxes, in which the 1st petitioner company

transported cigarette packets, to have the required pictorial warning. It appears

that the said argument has been formulated based on the English text of the Act

which reads as follows.

34. (1) A manufacturer or an importer of a tobacco product shall cause

to be displayed conspicuously and in legible print

(a) on the top surface area of both front and back sides of every

packet, package or carton containing the tobacco product

manufactured or imported by such manufacturer or

importer, health warnings, as may be prescribed, subject to

the provisions of section 34A; and

(b) on every packet, package or carton containing the tobacco

product manufactured or imported by such manufacturer or

importer, a label or a statement specifying the tar and

nicotine content in each tobacco product in such packet,

package or carton.

(2) A person shall not sell, offer for sale, supply, distribute or store a

packet, package or carton containing tobacco products unless health

warnings as provided for in subsection (1)(a) and a label or a statement

as provided for in subsection (1)(b), are displayed conspicuously in

legible print on every packet, package or carton containing the

tobacco products.

(3) Any person who contravenes the provisions of subsection (1) or

subsection (2), commits an offence and on conviction after summary

Page 8 of 15

trial by a Magistrate be liable to a fine not exceeding rupees fifty

thousand or to an imprisonment of either description for a term not

exceeding one year or to both such fine and imprisonment.

When this matter was argued before the Court of Appeal, the learned Presidents

Counsel, who represented the petitioners, had contended that every packet,

package or carton containing the tobacco products manufactured or imported

does not refer to a cardboard box, in which such products are being transported.

He has referred to the word carton as a much smaller cardboard box, which

carry several cigarette packets in packed form, and not the large cardboard box

as stated in the charges filed against the petitioners.

However, the Court of Appeal has disagreed with the said contention after

studying the Sinhala text of the Act, in relation to the words mentioned in section

34, which is the official version of the Act. It had been observed that the Sinhala

version is clearer without ambiguity, in which the requirement has been to have

the required pictorial warning on all packets, packages or cardboard boxes (

, ).

The Court has proceeded to interpret the word carton used in the English

translation of the Act as a reference made to the cardboard box mentioned in the

official version of the Act. It had been determined that the petitioners need to

adhere to the requirement of exhibiting the pictorial warning in the said boxes

as well.

However, it is clear from the judgment that the Court of Appeal has recognized

the fact of having an ambiguity between the official Sinhala version of the Act

and its English translation, and has proceeded to clear the said ambiguity in

pronouncing the relevant judgment.

It is an undisputed fact that after the judgment in the Writ Application was

pronounced, and the Leave to Appeal Application filed before the Supreme Court

was rejected, the petitioners have taken immediate steps to display the required

pictorial warning on the large cardboard boxes as well.

Page 9 of 15

When the matter was taken up before the Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura,

the 1st complainant-respondent-respondent has been represented by the Hon.

Attorney General, and the parties have agreed to admit the evidence led in case

number 94695 in relation to the case number 94696 of the same Court as well,

which is the Magistrates Court case under consideration in this revision

application, on the basis that facts relating to both the cases are the same.

The learned State Counsel, who represented the 1st complainant-respondent-

respondent, has called him to give evidence. He has explained the raid conducted

by him in relation to the case and has stated that he took into his custody,

several large cardboard boxes, which were used to transport cigarette packets,

and initiated proceedings against the petitioner and the other accused in terms

of the section 34(1)(a) or (b) of the NATA Act.

He has admitted that the contention of the accused at that time was that there

is no necessity for them to have the pictorial warning on the large cardboard

boxes, as 34(1)(a) or (b) does not require such warnings.

He has stated that when the matter was argued before the Court of Appeal in the

Writ Application filed by the petitioners, their arguments were based on the

English text of the relevant section, and the Court of Appeal has cleared any

ambiguity between the official Sinhala text of the Act and its English translation

by declaring that cardboard boxes, which are used to transport cigarette packets

should also have the required pictorial warning.

He has also stated that after the Court of Appeal judgment, he, as an Authorized

Officer appointed under the NATA Act, observed that the 1st accused company

has taken steps to display the required pictorial warning on the cardboard boxes

as well.

At the conclusion of the evidence of PW-01, the learned State Counsel making

submissions before the learned Magistrate of Anuradhapura, has conceded that

because of the ambiguity between the official Sinhala text of section 34 and the

English translation of the same of NATA Act, the petitioner might have acted in

Page 10 of 15

the manner as stated, and therefore, there is a question relating to the criminal

liability of the petitioner and the other accused. It has also been stated that after

the clearance of the said ambiguity by the Court of Appeal, the 1st accused

company had taken due steps to correct the situation.

The learned State Counsel has informed the Court that the Hon. Attorney

General does not intend to proceed with the complaint and has invited the Court

to consider his submission in terms of section 189 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act in making a suitable order, if the Court is satisfied in that regard.

This application has led to the order pronounced by the learned Magistrate of

Anuradhapura on 14-10-2022, where the learned Magistrate has determined

that he is not satisfied that there were sufficient reasons to allow the prosecution

to withdraw the charges filed against the petitioner and the other accused in

terms of section 189 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

Accordingly, the learned Magistrate has rejected the application made under

section 189, and has decided to proceed with the case.

The petitioner being aggrieved by the said determination had filed an application

in revision against the said determination before the Provincial High Court of the

North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura under Case Number

HCRA/05/2023. After considering the relevant application together with the

High Court of Anuradhapura Case Number HCRA/04/2023, which was filed

seeking to challenge the same order pronounced in Magistrates Court of

Anuradhapura Case Number 94695, the learned High Court Judge of

Anuradhapura by his order dated 06-08-2023 has dismissed both the above-

mentioned revision applications.

It has been determined that the learned Magistrate was correct in refusing to act

in terms of section 189 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and the petitioner

and the other accused had failed to establish sufficient exceptional

circumstances for the Court to intervene into the order pronounced by the

learned Magistrate.

Page 11 of 15

The petitioner has come before this Court invoking the revisionary jurisdiction

of this Court, seeking to challenge and set aside the order dated 08-06-2023

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of Provincial High Court of the

North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura, as well as the order dated 14-

10-2022 by the learned Magistrate of Anuradhapura.

When this matter was argued before this Court, the learned DSG making

submissions on behalf of the respondents submitted that the Hon. Attorney

General has used his prosecutorial discretion in the correct manner. It was her

submission that the alleged offence was based on a highly technical matter,

where it might have occurred due to the ambiguity that existed in the official

Sinhala version of the NATA Act and the English translation of the same. It was

her contention that it was under those circumstances and also due to the fact

that the 1st accused company had taken steps to comply with the said

requirements, the Hon. Attorney General made the application to withdraw the

charges against the petitioner and the other accused.

The learned Presidents Counsel who represented the petitioner was of the same

view and submitted that the learned Magistrate of Anuradhapura has failed to

appreciate the special circumstances that led to the charges being filed against

the petitioner, and the ambiguity that existed in interpreting the relevant

provision of the Act at that time.

He also brought to the notice of the Court that the 1st accused company is the

only licensed manufacturer of cigarettes in Sri Lanka and also one of the largest

contributors of revenue to the government by way of legitimate taxes paid. It was

his submission that under the circumstances, the learned High Court Judge

should have intervened and set aside the order by the learned Magistrate where

the learned Magistrate refused to allow the withdrawal of the charges filed.

He submitted that both the learned Magistrate and the learned High Court Judge

has considered the facts and the law on a wrong premise, therefore, the petitioner

has established sufficient exceptional grounds for this Court to intervene and set

Page 12 of 15

aside the relevant orders, and to acquit the petitioner and the other accused from

the charges filed against them before the Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura.

It is trite law that the remedy of revision being a discretionary remedy, the Court

of Appeal will grant such a remedy only under exceptional circumstances. What

constitutes exceptional circumstances had been defined over time by our

Superior Courts when pronouncing judgments in relation to the applications,

which required the Courts intervention using its discretionary powers of

revision.

It was held in the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Mercantile Hotels

Management Ltd (1987) 1 SLR 5 that,

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thamararatnam (Sriskantha Law Report

Volume IV page 47) it was stated that;

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the Court.

In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365, it

was observed,

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

occasioned due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice.

I would also like to quote from the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In Charge of

Norton Bridge Police Station (supra) which I find relevant in the above context.

The revisionary power of Court is a discretionary power. This is an

extraordinary jurisdiction which is exercised by the Court and the grant of

relief is entirely dependent of the Court. The grant of such relief is of course

Page 13 of 15

a matter entirely in the discretion of the Court, and always be dependent on

the circumstances of each case. Existence of exceptional circumstances is

the process by which the extraordinary power of revision should be adopted.

The exceptional circumstances would vary from case to case and their

degree of exceptionality must be correctly assessed and gauged by the Court

taking into consideration all antecedent circumstances using the yardstick

whether a failure of justice would occur unless revisionary powers are

invoked.

As I considered above, it is abundantly clear that the petitioner and the 1st

accused had not exhibited the required pictorial warning on the cardboard boxes

used to transport cigarette packets manufactured by the 1st accused company

on the belief that such warnings are not necessary on the cardboard boxes.

Although the official version of an Act passed by the legislature is the Sinhala

Act, and the Sinhala Act shall prevail over the English or Tamil translations of

the Act, it is common knowledge that it is the English translation that would be

commonly used in interpreting the words mentioned in an Act passed by the

legislature. It is clear that it was the very reason for the misinterpretation of the

provisions of the Act by the petitioner.

However, what is also clear and relevant is the fact that the petitioner and the1st

accused company had taken immediate steps to correct the situation once the

Court of Appeal provided a clear interpretation as to the requirements of the

NATA Act.

I am in agreement with the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel as

well as the learned DSG that the learned Magistrate should have considered the

application by the prosecution based on the above circumstances on a rational

and reasonable basis, although the learned Magistrate has decided to consider

otherwise.

Page 14 of 15

The relevant section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act under which the

learned State Counsel, who represented the complainant, has made the

application to withdraw the charges reads as follows.

189. If a complainant at any time before judgment is given in any

case under this Chapter satisfies the Magistrate that there are

sufficient grounds for permitting him to withdraw the case the

Magistrate may permit him to withdraw the same and shall thereupon

acquit the accused, but he shall record his reasons for doing so

:Provided, however, that anything herein contained shall not be taken

to extend the powers of a Magistrate to allow the compounding of

offences under the provisions of section 266.

When the said application was made before the learned Magistrate, there was no

dispute of the fact that the petitioner and the 1st accused company had taken

steps to comply with the requirements of the Act after the pronouncement of the

Court of Appeal judgment. The submissions made before the Court clearly

provide that the actions of the petitioner had been based on a misapprehension

of the relevant law and not due to intentional violation of the law.

It is also clear that after having considered the relevant facts and the

circumstances, and the interpretation of the law by the Court of Appeal, the Hon.

Attorney General has used his prosecutorial discretion in a correct manner and

not with the intention of allowing a guilty party to escape a crime.

Apart from the above considerations, it also needs to be noted that prosecutorial

discretion has been used considering the highly technical nature of the offence

as well.

Under the circumstances, I am of the view that the learned Magistrate of

Anuradhapura had sufficient grounds before him to permit the complainant to

withdraw the charges filed against the petitioner. I am unable to agree with the

reasons given by the learned Magistrate of Anuradhapura in order to disallow

the application for withdrawal of the complaint based on the judgment

Page 15 of 15

pronounced by the Court of Appeal in CA/WRT/492/2015. I am of the view that

the consideration should have been on the basis of the facts and the

circumstances, as well as the law, taken as a whole.

I am also of the view that the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High

Court of the North Central Province holden in Anuradhapura was not correct

when the learned High Court Judge decided to dismiss the revision application

filed before it on the basis that he had no reasons to interfere with the order of

the learned Magistrate.

It is my considered view that the petitioner had adduced sufficient exceptional

grounds for this Court to intervene and set aside the order pronounced by the

learned Magistrate of Anuradhapura on 14-10-2022 and also the order

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge on 08-06-2023, as both the orders

cannot be allowed to stand.

Accordingly, I set aside the said orders, allow the application to withdraw the

charges, and acquit the petitioner and the other accused from the charges

preferred against them before the Magistrate Court of Anuradhapura. Hence, I

allow the revision application filed by the petitioner.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment forthwith,

to the Provincial High Court of the North Central Province holden in

Anuradhapura, and also to the Magistrates Court of Anuradhapura for

information purposes, and necessary compliance.
