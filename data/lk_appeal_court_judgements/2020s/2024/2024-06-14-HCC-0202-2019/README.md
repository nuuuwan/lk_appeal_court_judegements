Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Chilaw for committing the offence of rape of a minor

between the periods of 07-10-2007 and 06-10-2008 at Marawila, within the

jurisdiction of the High Court of Chilaw, and thereby violating section 364(2)(e)

of the Penal Code punishable in terms of section 364(2) as amended by the Penal

Code Amendment Act No. 22 of 1995.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw found the appellant guilty as

charged of the judgment dated 26-06-2019.

Page 3 of 21

Accordingly, after having considered the mitigatory as well as the aggravating

circumstances, the learned High Court Judge sentenced the appellant for a

period of 15 years rigorous imprisonment. In addition, the appellant has been

ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 25,000/- and in default, to serve 12 months rigorous

imprisonment.

The appellant has also been ordered to pay Rs. 250,000/- as compensation and

it has been ordered that it should be recovered as a fine.

It is noteworthy to mention that although compensation has been ordered, the

learned High Court Judge has failed to mention to whom it should be paid,

although obviously it should be paid to the victim of the crime, namely PW-02

mentioned in the indictment. The learned High Court Judge has also failed to

impose a default sentence, in the event the appellant fails to pay the

compensation amount, which has been ordered to be recovered as a fine.

Being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentences, the appellant preferred this

appeal.

Facts in Brief

The victim of this crime has been listed to give evidence as PW-02 in the

indictment. She has commenced her evidence at the trial on 11-09-2017, some

9 years after the alleged incident. By that time, she was a 21-year-old married

person. She has been born on 13-02-1996.

According to her evidence, during the time relevant to this incident, which

happened in October 2008, she and her mother were living in an accommodation

provided at a tile factory in Marawila. Although she had an elder sister and a

brother, they have been married and was living separately at that time. Her

father has also been separated from the family. Her mother was employed at the

said tile factory.

Page 4 of 21

The appellant was their neighbor who lived with his family in his own house. On

the day of the incident, the victim has gone to the house of the appellant in order

to make a call to her married elder sister to inform her about the demise of a

mother of one of the teachers in their dhamma school. She has gone to the house

of the appellant since her house had no telephone facilities. She has been to the

appellants house before, and knew the appellant and his family very well.

When she went to his house around mid-day, only the appellant had been in the

house. When she informed of her need to him, the appellant had allowed her to

make a call using their phone. After the call the appellant had led the victim

child to a nearby sofa and had shown a compact disc (CD) played in the TV to

her. In the process, the appellant had removed the clothes of the child and

wanted her to perform the acts shown in the TV screen. The victim has refused,

but the appellant after removing the sarong he was wearing, has forcibly entered

his penis into the victim childs vagina. The incident has occurred on the sofa.

The appellant has closed the front door after he played the CD, which was shown

to the victim child.

After the incident, the victim has returned to her home but has not divulged the

incident to anyone. However, when her elder sister visited her place of residence

some 2-3 days after the incident, she has informed the incident of rape, and

made a complaint in this regard.

In her evidence, she has stated that apart from this incident, she was also raped

several times by a person called Sanath, who apparently had been the paramour

of her mother.

Under cross-examination, she has admitted that the mentioned Sanath was the

paramour of her mother. The learned Counsel who represented the appellant at

the trial has questioned the victim child in detail about the sexual harassment

and rape incident committed by the mentioned Sanath to the child. She has

admitted that what she initially informed to her sister was that the said Sanath

had committed sexual acts on her. However, she has maintained the position

Page 5 of 21

that after informing about Sanath, she informed what happened to her at the

hands of the appellant as well. It has been suggested to her that her mother

instigated her to not implicate Sanath to the crime and to implicate the appellant,

which the victim has denied.

The mother of the victim child has given evidence as PW-03. It had been her

position that when the victim child was hospitalized on the allegation of being

raped by the person with whom she was living with at that time, namely one

Sanath Ananda, she informed her that she was raped by the appellant as well.

She has maintained the position that she had no issues with the appellant and

his family until then.

It needs to be noted that the elder sister of the victim child to whom the child

has narrated what happened to her before she informed anyone else, has not

been called as a witness for the prosecution although she has been so listed.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who examined the child has observed that

the child had been subjected to repeated sexual intercourse, which has resulted

in her hymen being attenuated at 3 and 9 oclock positions. He has observed

post-traumatic stress on the child. Giving the history to the JMO, the child has

stated that the person called Indunil aiya committed rape on her when she

visited his house. After observing multiple incidents of sexual intercourse, the

doctor has questioned her further as to the history where she has indicated that

a person called Sanath maama used to commit rape on her regularly for a period

of one year. At the time the doctor examined her, she had been a 12 years and 7

months old child.

According to the evidence of the police officers who have conducted

investigations into the incident, after recording the victim childs mothers

statement at the hospital on 07-10-2008, the female police officer who recorded

the victims statement has taken the child to a separate place and had recorded

her statement. The child has revealed that she was repeatedly raped by the

mothers paramour and she was also raped by the appellant.

Page 6 of 21

After the prosecution case was closed, the learned High Court Judge of Chilaw

has decided to call for a defence from the appellant based on the evidence placed

before the Court.

The appellant as well as his wife has given evidence in this matter. The appellant

has also called the elder sister of the victim child who was listed as a prosecution

witness (but not called by the prosecution) as a defence witness.

The appellant giving evidence has admitted that the victim child came to his

house to make a call, but has maintained the position that at that time, both he

and his wife were at home, and it was to his wife the victim child informed her

need to make a call. It was his position that because of her need, he gave his

mobile phone to her, but it was given outside of his house, in front of his wife.

After making the call, the child had left. He has denied that he committed rape

on the child.

The wife of the appellant in her evidence has maintained the same position and

had stated that it was to her, the child spoke and requested for a call, which

resulted in her telling her husband to allow the child to use his mobile phone.

She has maintained the position that the child left after making the call and

nothing else happened between them. However, under cross-examination, she

has admitted that their house had a land phone as well. When questioned about

as to when this incident occurred as claimed by them, she has stated that she

can remember that it happened in 2008 some 2-3 months after the Sinhala New

Year.

The sister of the victim child in her evidence has stated that when she visited the

house, her sister informed her that her mothers paramour Sanath Ananda

committed sexual intercourse on her, which resulted her admitting her sister to

the hospital and lodging a complaint with the police in that regard. According to

her, although her sister informed only about Sanath Ananda, when she was

hospitalized, she has informed about the rape incident committed by the

appellant to her mother. She has stated in her evidence that when she was

Page 7 of 21

informed about what her mothers paramour did to her, she in fact went to the

appellants house and informed his wife about the incident and inquired about

the appellant with the intention of getting his three-wheeler to take her sister to

the hospital. She has also stated that after getting to know the incident involving

the appellant, she questioned her sister, and she confirmed that she was also

sexually harassed by the appellant.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel formulated the

following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. Did the learned High Court Judge err in not considering the infirmities

in the prosecution evidence.

2. Did the learned High Court Judge fail to consider the importance of

section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance as relevant when the

prosecution failed to call the evidence of the sister of the victim as a

witness for the prosecution.

3. Was the accuseds entitlement for a fair trial impaired by the indefinite

date of offence stated in the indictment.

4. Did the learned High Court Judge err by wrongly rejecting the defence

evidence.

5. Did the learned High Court Judges failure to act according to the

required procedural steps cause a disadvantage to the accused.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

At this juncture, I find it relevant to consider the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th grounds of

appeal before considering the rest, as I find the said grounds of appeal revolving

around questions of law as well as questions of fact.

In relation to the 2nd ground of appeal, it was the position of the learned

Presidents Counsel that the best evidence, as to what happened to the victim

child would have been that of her sister to whom she has informed about the

Page 8 of 21

sexual harassment faced by her. It was his contention that the sister of the

victim, namely PW-01 listed in the indictment was not called by the prosecution,

in fact she had been released from the case even before the trial commenced, but

had been called as a defence witness. It was argued that the provisions of section

114 illustration (f) of the Evidence Ordinance should have been considered in

full force in favuor of the appellant based on the facts and the circumstances of

the case.

It is well-settled law that it is the totality of the evidence that should be

considered, be it the evidence by the prosecution or by the defence, in order to

come to a finding whether the prosecution has proved the case beyond

reasonable doubt or else, the evidence has created a reasonable doubt or has

given a reasonable explanation as to the evidence against an accused person.

It was held in the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2

SLR 167 that,

A satisfactory way of arriving at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters adduced before the Court, whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing it, ask himself whether

as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, whether he

believed the accused guilty of the charge or not.

The argument advanced by the learned Presidents Counsel is that the

presumption of the existence of certain facts in terms of section 114 illustration

(f) of the Evidence Ordinance should have been considered by the learned Trial

Judge in favor of the appellant.

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the relevant section, which reads

thus;

114. The Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks

likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of

Page 9 of 21

natural events, human conduct, and public and private business in

their relation to the facts of the particular case.

Illustration

The Court may presume-

(f) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if

produced, be unfavourable to the persons who withholds it;

It is my considered view that, accused person can claim the advantage of the

above section if the evidence which could have been led at the trial was not led

as part of the evidence in the case.

However, the situation in this case is very much different. Although the

prosecution has not led the evidence of the sister to whom the victim child has

narrated her sufferings due to sexual abuse faced by her, the appellant, when

called for his defence, has called her as a defence witness. This means whatever

the evidence she was expected to give at the trial has been led in the case,

enabling the Court to consider the said evidence as a part of the case.

As I have considered above, since the evidence placed before a Court in a criminal

trial has to be considered in its totality rather than compartmentalizing it, the

learned trial Judge has had the advantage of considering the evidence of the

victims sister when coming to a conclusion whether the prosecution has proved

the case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant.

This goes on to show that since the relevant evidence was before the Court, the

fact of not calling such evidence by the prosecution has not caused any prejudice

towards the appellant. It is my view that illustration (f) of section 114 of the

Evidence Ordinance has no application under the circumstances.

In the 3rd ground of appeal, it was urged that the appellants entitlement to a fair

trial was impaired because of the indefinite date of offence in the indictment.

Page 10 of 21

It was pointed out that the evidence indicates that the incident where the

appellant has alleged to have raped the child occurred 3 days before she informed

it to her sister. It was questioned as to why the prosecution needed to mention

a period of one year without mentioning a definite date, which has occasioned

an unfair trial towards the appellant.

The relevant section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, which refers to

the particulars as to the time, the place and the person that should be stated in

a charge reads as follows.

165(1). The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and

place of the alleged offence and as to the person (if any) against whom

and as to the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed as

are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with

which he is charged and to show that, the offence is not prescribed.

The section itself is clear enough that the purpose of giving the date and the

place of the incident is to give sufficient notice to the accused as to the charge

against him.

Hence, only if it can be shown that the appellant was misled as to the charge

against him or could not put forward his defence as a result of the witness who

spoke about the date of the incident and by not giving a definite date in the

indictment, he could not establish his defence as a result of that, the appellant

can succeed in such a position.

It is clear from the evidence placed before the trial Court that the appellant has

admitted that the victim child came to his house and wanted to make a telephone

call. It has been his contention that it happened when his wife was present and

it was his handphone he allowed the child to use, and no sexual harassment or

an incident of rape took place. However, I find that what is material here is the

fact that the admission of the appellant that the child came to his house to make

a phone call.

Page 11 of 21

It shows that the appellant was not denied of an opportunity of taking up an

alibi due to the admission, which has caused no prejudice towards the appellant

as to a fair trial.

This aspect was sufficiently discussed in the case Rex Vs. Dossi 13 Cr. App. R.

158 where it was held that the date specified in an indictment is not material

unless it is an essential part of the alleged offence; the defendant may be

convicted although the Jury finds that the offence was committed on a date other

than that specified in the indictment, amendment of the indictment is

unnecessary although it may be a good practice to do so (provided that there is

no prejudice to the accused) where it is clear on the evidence that the offence

was committed and it was committed on a day other than that specified.

In the case of D.R.M Pandithakoralage (Excise Inspector) Vs. V.K

Selvanayagam 56 NLR 143, it was held that a mistaken date in the indictment

is not a material error, unless the date is of the essence of the offence or the

accused is prejudiced.

The evidence led in this matter had clearly established that the offence has

occurred during the period mentioned in the indictment. For the reasons as

considered above, I find that the date not being specific, has not caused any

prejudice towards the appellant.

The 5th ground of appeal urged by the learned Presidents Counsel was on the

basis that the learned High Court Judge has proceeded to read over the

indictment to the appellant, even before the indictment was served on him, and

has failed to comply with the requirements of section 195 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

As per the proceedings dated 26-10-2016, it is clear that the indictment has been

served on the appellant only after the indictment was read over to him and he

pleaded not guilty to the charge. This was contrary to the procedure laid down

in terms of section 195 and 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

Page 12 of 21

In terms of section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, once the

indictment is received by the High Court, it is the duty of the presiding Judge to

notice the accused mentioned in the indictment and order him to appear or to

be brought before him and cause a copy of the indictment with its annextures to

be served on the accused.

(Since this was a case taken up before the Code of Criminal Procedure

(Amendment) Act No. 2 of 2022, setting the matter for pretrial conference was

not a requirement.)

At the same time, the accused can be released on suitable bail if the offence is

an offence where the accused can be released as such, cause the accused to be

fingerprinted and if the offence is an offence that can be triable by a Jury, inquire

from the accused whether he elects or not to be tried by a Jury.

If the accused informs the Court that he wishes to have his case tried before a

Jury, the necessary steps of the procedure have to be adhered to in that regard.

If the accused is unrepresented and wants the services of an assigned counsel,

the Court should facilitate such a request as well.

The matter shall be fixed for trial thereafter.

In terms of section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, it is only after the

fulfillment of the above-mentioned criterion and after the matter is fixed for trial,

the indictment shall be read over and explained to the accused once the Court

is ready to commence the trial.

The relevant section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows;

196. When the Court is ready to commence the trial the accused shall

appear or be brought before it and the indictment shall be read and

explained to him and he shall be asked whether he is guilty or not

guilty to the offence charged.

Page 13 of 21

I am of the view that although the learned High Court Judge has failed to follow

the due procedure before the charge was read over to the appellant, that in itself

would not nullify the proceedings unless if it can be established that it has

caused a material prejudice to the appellant or has occasioned a failure of

justice.

The Article 138 of The Constitution is the provision which confers jurisdiction to

the Court of Appeal to hear and determine appeals of this nature.

The proviso of Article 138 reads as follows:

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any Court shall be

reversed or varied on a count of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights to the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

The similar statutory provision in section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act reads as follows:

436. Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

asked by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered in an appeal or revision on account-

(a) of any error, omission, irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135, unless

such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a

failure of justice.

The above-mentioned statutory provisions clearly provide that the test should be

whether such an irregularity, as claimed in this appeal, has occasioned a failure

of justice, or has caused a prejudice to the substantial rights of the appellant.

Page 14 of 21

I find that the appellant has been represented by a Counsel when the indictment

was read over to him and right throughout the trial. It is amply clear that

although the indictment was read over to the appellant on 26-10-2016 and

thereafter only it has been served on him along with the annexures, the trial has

commenced only on 11-09-2017, which has provided enough space for the

appellant to study and get ready to face the charge against him. I am of the view

that no prejudice or failure of substantial rights has occasioned to him in that

regard.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the 2nd, 3rd, and the

5th grounds of appeal urged on behalf of the appellant are devoid of merit.

Having determined the said grounds of appeal, I will now proceed to consider the

1st and the 4th grounds of appeal together as they are interrelated.

It was contended that the learned High Court Judge erred in not considering the

infirmities in the prosecution evidence and also erred by wrongly rejecting the

defence evidence.

It was submitted that admittedly, the mother of the victim child had a paramour

and it was against the paramour, the victim child informed her sister that she is

being abused. It was contended that the name of the appellant was something

that was introduced and that was an infirmity that could have been considered

in favour of the appellant. It was also contended that the period of the offence

mentioned in the indictment was actually related to the offence alleged to have

committed by the paramour of the victims mother, and when the victim as well

as her mother gave evidence in Court, they were very hesitant to mention the

paramour or whether the victims mother had an illegitimate relationship with

paramour. It was also submitted that the evidence also shows the fact that the

mother knew very well about the sexual abuse committed on her daughter by

her paramour and she has failed to divulge that fact to the sister of the victim

when these matters came to light, and she clearly has turned a blind eye which

should have been considered in favour of the appellant.

Page 15 of 21

In fact, it was submitted that even the learned High Court Judge has found that

the mother was evasive in her evidence, which again should have been

considered in favour of the defence version of events.

Referring to the defence case put forward at the trial, it was the position of the

learned Presidents Counsel that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the evidence of the appellant, his wife, as well as the evidence given by

the sister of the victim when called on behalf of the appellant in its correct

perspective by failing to consider whether their evidence can be believed, or

whether it has created a reasonable doubt or explanation about the prosecution

case. It was pointed out that the learned High Court Judge, at several places in

the judgment has determined that the appellant has failed to contest or challenge

the evidence ( ), to consider it against the appellant. It was submitted

that it was a wrong assumption made in order to reject the evidence of the

appellant and his witnesses, as it was the duty of the prosecution to prove the

charge beyond reasonable doubt.

The evidence of the victim child and that of the JMO makes it clear that the child

had been subjected to grave sexual abuse and sexual intercourse over a period

of time. The evidence establishes the fact that she had been abused by her own

mothers paramour. It also shows that the mother had been aware of at least

some of the incidents, but has turned a blind eye towards them.

I find the fact that the victim being a 12-year-old who is dependent on her

mother, well explained the girls behaviour when she failed to inform of the

incidents to anyone else until she had the opportunity to tell what was happening

to her elder sister. It is true that initially she has told the sister only about the

abuses towards her by the paramour of her mother. The child has come out

about the incident where she was raped by the appellant, only after she was

admitted to the hospital. The mothers evidence was that while the child was

hospitalized, she revealed to her that apart from her paramour, the appellant

also had sexual intercourse with her.

Page 16 of 21

Although the appellant has suggested that when cross-examining the mother of

the victim, it was she who instigated the child to make a false allegation against

him, the evidence clearly shows that the mother had not attempted to protect

the paramour when the incidents were revealed to her.

The child had been admitted to the hospital on the basis that she was raped by

the paramour, which shows that the mother was not attempting to protect him

at that time.

The police officer who had recorded the statement of the child had separated the

child from the mother and recorded the statement, where the child has revealed

the incident of rape, which led to the indictment against the appellant.

When the child was examined by the doctor, she has first revealed the incident

of rape alleged to have been committed by the appellant. Subsequently, she has

informed the doctor that she was continuously raped over a period of time by the

paramour of her mother. This provides consistency as to the evidence of the child

in relation to the allegation against the appellant.

It is clear from the evidence of the victim child that although she was not certain

about the date of the incident, she was certain that it happened on the day where

she went to make a telephone call to her elder sister. It is quite possible that the

child being a 12-year-old and having being subjected to sexual abuse

continuously may have forgotten the timeline as to what happened first or when.

In the case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. Attorney General, CA 64/2003 decided on

6-10-2009 reported in Bar Association Law Journal (2010) (B.L.R.) 92, it was

held;

Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon as

possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders should not be allowed to

capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural inherent weaknesses of

small children.

Page 17 of 21

In the case of Mahathun and Others Vs. Attorney General (2015) 1 SLR 74,

it was held;

1. When faced with contradictions in a witnesss testimonial, the Court

must bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions

viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness.

2. Two greater significances cannot be attached to minor discrepancies or

contradictions.

3. What is important is whether the witness is telling the truth on the

material matters concerned with the event.

4. Where evidence is generally reliable, much importance should not be

attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors.

5. The Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the finding of a trial Judge

with regard to the acceptance or rejection of a witness unless it is

manifestly wrong.

The fact that the victim child was not forthcoming with the allegation against the

appellant initially has to be considered having in mind the overall picture of the

situation faced by the victim child, to consider whether the delay in her making

the allegation against the appellant can be considered as an infirmity in relation

to the prosecution case.

In the case of D. Tikirbanda Vs. AG (supra), it was determined that:

If delay of making a statement is explainable the evidence of a witness

should not be rejected on that ground alone.

In the case of Gamage Prabath Janaka Nayana Priyantha Perera Vs. Attorney

General CA 107/2012 decided on 27-05-2016, Nawaz, J. observed that,

Why the witness did not reveal the drastical act or otherwise is a fact for

him or her to explain and in fact if the explanation is plausible and credible

the Court must act on the testimony albeit belated. If the explanation for the

delayed statement is plausible and acceptable and the Court accepts the

Page 18 of 21

same as plausible, there is no reason to interfere with the conclusion made

by the trial Court for accepting the belated statement.

The learned High Court Judge in her judgment has considered whether the delay

in coming out with the allegation against the appellant has caused a doubt as to

the evidence and has come to a finding that it was not so, for which I have no

reason to disagree.

I am not in a position to consider the victim not informing that the appellant was

also responsible for her plight to the sister at the first instance as an infirmity in

her evidence. The facts and the circumstances clearly show that she has been

suffering silently because of the sexual abuse faced by her and she has come out

with it to her sister out of sheer desperation. Since it was the paramour of the

mother who had been committing sexual abuses on her regularly by that time,

it appears that she has initially informed about him to her sister which has led

to her being hospitalized.

Her evidence clearly shows that she has gathered enough courage to inform her

suffering because she was made aware of such abuses during a program held in

her school. It is clear that when she gained confidence that she is under the

protection of the authorities, she has come out with the incident of rape

committed by the appellant. I find that her evidence in that regard was cogent

and trustworthy which can be relied upon.

Although the learned High Court Judge has stated at several places in the

judgment that the appellant has failed to challenge the evidence of the victim

child and other witnesses, I am of the view, that in itself does not mean that the

learned High Court Judge has moved away from the duty of the prosecution to

prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt or had relied on the weaknesses of

the defence put forward by the appellant to convict him.

As correctly viewed by the learned High Court Judge, when the victim child was

giving evidence and being cross-examined, the questions posed to her had been

mostly in relation to the mothers paramour and as to the incident where she

Page 19 of 21

was allegedly raped by the appellant. Other than suggesting that she is lying

under the influence of her mother in order to save the mothers paramour, no

other suggestion has been made to her.

Similarly, when the mother of the child gave evidence, it is clear that what the

mother has stated was what she was told by her daughter. She has been very

clear that initially what was said to her was that the child was raped by her

paramour, and only when she was at the hospital she informed about the rape

incident committed by the appellant. She has been questioned at length about

her paramour and his involvement. Nothing has been suggested to challenge her

evidence in relation to what she came to know about the appellant. If the

allegation was that the victim child gave evidence against the appellant after

having being instigated by her mother, that suggestion should have been put to

the mother when she was giving evidence and should have cross-examined her

based on that fact. The appellant has not made any allegation as such when the

mother was giving evidence at the trial.

I am of the view that what the learned High Court Judge has stated needs to be

considered in that context, which does not show that the learned High Court

Judge was misdirected as to the burden of proof in a criminal case.

It is well settled law that when an accused person takes up a particular line of

defence, such a line has to be put to the relevant witnesses when they give

evidence for the prosecution. If the accused fails to confront the relevant

witnesses with his stand so that they can answer, but comes out with a story,

which should have been put to the witnesses when he was called upon for a

defence, such a defence in my view has little value unless it creates a reasonable

doubt against the evidence of the prosecution.

In the case Indian Supreme Court case of Sarwan Singh Vs. State of Punjab

(2002) AIR S.C. iii 3652 it was observed;

Page 20 of 21

It is rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put this case in cross-examination it must

follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.

His Lordship Sisira de Arbrew, J. stated in Pilippu Mandige Nalaka

Krishantha Kumara Thisera Vs. AG, CA 87/2005 decided on 17-05-2007

that;

I hold that whenever evidence given by a witness on a material fact is

not challenged in cross-examination it has to be concluded that such

evidence is not disputed. And is accepted by the opponent subject of course

to the qualification that the witness is a reliable witness.

When the accused was called upon for his defence, his position had been to the

effect that although the child came to his house to make a telephone call, it

happened on a day where his wife was also present and it was from his wife, the

child came and asked permission to take a telephone call. It has also been stated

that she came near the boundary fence of their house and used his mobile phone

to take the call and left. The position of the wife of the appellant had also been

the same.

However, when the child was cross-examined, none of these positions had been

put to her. Since the child was the best person to provide answers to such a

stand, without confronting the child of that position, coming up with such a

stand has no value or reason to be considered in favour of the appellants version

of events.

If the allegation was that the mother of the victim child instigated her to make a

false complaint against the appellant, the mother of the child would have been

confronted in that regard. As I have stated before, no questions had been put to

her to suggest any instigation by the mother.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has devoted a part of her judgment, as

she should have, to consider the defence case put forward in order to find

Page 21 of 21

whether it has created a doubt as to the prosecution case or a reasonable

explanation has been provided. She has well considered the relevant positions

in order to justify the conclusions reached in that regard in rejecting the stand

of the appellant. I find that the learned High Court Judge has come to correct

findings in that regard, which gives no reason for me to interfere on the basis

that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the defence put forward

by the appellant.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the 1st and the 4th grounds

of appeal either.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit.

Having considered the learned High Court Judges failure to pronounce a default

sentence if the appellant fails to pay the compensation ordered and to whom it

should be paid, I direct that the sentencing order should stand varied to read

that the compensation should be paid to PW-02, the victim of the incident, and

in default of paying the sum mentioned, the default sentence should be 18

months simple imprisonment.

However, having considered the fact that the appellant had been in incarceration

from his date of conviction and the sentence, it is ordered that his sentence shall

be deemed to have commenced from his date of sentence, namely 26-06-2019.
