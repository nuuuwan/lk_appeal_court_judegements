Written submissions tendered on:

02.11.2022 by the 1st, 2nd, 2A, 3rd 7th 23rd and 24th Respondents

23.11.2022 by the Petitioner

Argued by way of written submissions.

Decided on: 26.02.2024

S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Petitioner is a Bachelor of Arts degree holder from the University of Ruhuna and

an employee of the 1st Respondent, the Central Environmental Authority (the CEA) was

recruited as a Divisional Environmental Officer with effect from 10.02.2000 and

subsequently promoted to the post of Senior Environmental Officer on 11.08.2008

(P4(i), P4(ii)). While functioning as the Senior Environmental Officer, he has covered

the duties of Assistant Director of Hambantota District from 15.01.2014 to 12.04.2014

(P5).

On 29.12.2016, the CEA called applications to fill the vacancies for the posts of

Assistant Director (Environment) (P6). The job vacancy notice marked as P6

distinguished the qualifications required to be possessed by the applicants who are

either internal or external. Accordingly, external applicants were required to possess a

bachelors degree in the field of Environmental Science/ Agriculture or any other

relevant field which is recognized by the University Grants Commission and a

minimum of five years post-qualifying experience as an Executive Level in the field of

environment after obtaining the first degree. The internal applicants were required to

possess qualifications required by the external candidates or five years of satisfactory

service as a Senior Environmental Officer/ Senior Environmental Education Officer.

7

The selection process was based on the results of a written competitive examination

and/or a structured interview conducted by a panel appointed by the appointing

authority as determined by the Board of Directors. The applicants were required to

submit the applications on or before 15.01.2017. In the internal memo dated 26.03.2018

marked as P7(i) it has been stated, inter alia, that the written exam would be held on

09.04.2018, the Management had decided to fill only 39 vacancies which existed as of

15.01.2017 i.e. to the date of closing the applications, a waiting list would not be

maintained to fill the vacancies arising after the cut-off date and to fill the vacancies

arising after 15.01.2017, the applications would be freshly called (P7(i)).

By the office memo dated 16.03.2018 marked as P7(ii) it has been notified the

candidates that the written examination would comprise of two question papers on

Subject Knowledge and General Management. The written examination was held on

09.04.2018. The list of candidates selected for the structured interview was released on

28.05.2018 of which the Petitioners index number SLF/CEA/AD/14 was also

shortlisted for the interview (P8). The structured interviews were conducted on

06.06.2018 (P9). On 22.06.2018, the final marks of the written examination and the

structured interview were released (P13). The Petitioner was ranked 48th in the list as

he received 63 marks for the Subject Knowledge paper, 61 marks for the Management

Paper and 25 marks for the interview which added to total marks of 47.8.

On 02.07.2018, the CEA appointed 32 candidates as Assistant Directors who were

awarded the highest marks as per the mark sheet marked as P13. On 17.04.2019 an

internal memo marked as P17 was issued by the 23rd Respondent to appoint 7th -21st

Respondents also as Assistant Directors to fill 15 vacancies which were vacant after the

8

appointments made on 02.07.2018. The Petitioner was not selected for any of the

above-mentioned appointments.

By this Writ Application, the Petitioner challenges the mark sheet marked as P13 based

on the facts inter alia, that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 22nd and/or 23rd Respondents acted in

violation of the applicable Scheme of Recruitment (the SoR), existing laws and

regulations and they were failed to properly ascertain, evaluate and/or examine the

qualifications and the experience of the 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st Respondents in

appointing them as Assistant Directors which renders such conduct of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,

22nd and/or 23rd Respondents unjust, arbitrary, improper, unlawful, illegal, wrongful,

ultra vires and a nullity.

The substantive reliefs sought by the Petitioner in the Petition are, inter alia,

c) Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the mark sheet marked as P13.

d) Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 22nd and/or 23rd

Respondents to re-evaluate the basic qualifications and/or experience of all the

candidates for the posts of Assistant Director (Environment) of the CEA as per the

applicable Scheme of Recruitment, existing laws and regulations.

e) Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 22nd and/or 23rd

Respondents to reconduct the written competitive examination and/or a structured

interview for the appointment and /or promotion to the posts of Assistant Director

(Environment).

f) Grant and issue a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 22nd and/or 23rd

Respondents from making any further appointments and/or promotions to the post

of Assistant Director (Environment).

9

g) Grant and issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 22nd

and/or 23rd Respondents to promote the 18th,19th, 20th and 21st Respondents to the

posts of Assistant Director (Environment).

h) Grant and issue a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 22nd and/or 23rd

Respondents to promote the Petitioner to the post of Assistant Director

(Environment).

The main contention of the learned DSG appearing for the Respondents is that this

Court is denuded of any power to grant any relief to the Petitioner because the Supreme

Court had refused to grant leave to proceed in a Fundamental Rights Application

bearing number SC/FR/170/2019 filed by three applicants who were not promoted to

the posts of Assistant Directors challenging the appointments of the 18th, 19th, 20th, and

21st Respondents on the same grounds of this Application. Thus, he contended that

contradicting the Supreme Court's ruling, this Court has no power to provide reliefs

sought by the Petitioner, who was the 23rd Respondent in the aforementioned

Fundamental Rights Application. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner

argued that this Writ Application is distinguishable from the Fundamental Rights

Application because the wrongful, illegal and irregular manner of the promotion

process was neither raised nor addressed by the Supreme Court in its Order marked as

P22(b).

Under the above-stated circumstances, it is pertinent to consider whether the order

refusing leave in the Fundamental Rights Application becomes res judicata enabling

the Petitioner to maintain this Writ Application. In Nandawathie and Others Vs. Tikiri

Banda Mudalali1, Dissanayake, J. held that the principle of res judicata would apply if

1 [2003] 2 SLR 347

10

the second action consists of the same parties, of the same subject matter and the same

cause of action. In Herath Vs. The Attorney General2, Basnayake CJ. held that,

The whole of our law of res judicata is to be found in sections 34, 207 and 406

of the Civil Procedure Code. The decrees spoken of in section 207 are decrees

drawn up by the court under section 188 after judgement has been pronounced

in the manner contemplated by sections 184,185,186 and 187 of the Civil

Procedure Code. Section 207 will therefore apply only to decrees pronounced

after there has been adjudication on the merits of a suit

In the instant action, it is to be decided whether the dismissal of the Fundamental Rights

Application at the leave to proceed stage amounts to res judicata. In the Indian

Judgement of Kunhayammed & ORS. Vs. State of Kerala & ANR.3 delivered on

19.07.2000, the Indian Supreme Court referred Workmen of Cochin Port Trust Vs.

Board of Trustees of the Cochin Port Trust and Another4, where a Three-Judges Bench

of the Indian Supreme Court held that,

dismissal of special leave petition by the Supreme Court by a non-speaking

order of dismissal where no reasons were given does not constitute res

judicata. All that can be said to have been decided by the Court is that it was

not a fit case where special leave should be granted. That may be due to various

reasons.

In the same case, the Court referred to Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. Vs. State of Bihar

and Ors.5 in which a labour dispute was adjudicated upon by an award made by the

2 [1958] 60 NLR 193 3 [2000] 6 SCC 359 4 [1978] 3 SCC 119 5 AIR [1986] SC 1780

11

Labour Court. The employer moved to the Supreme Court by filing a special leave

petition against the award which was dismissed by a non-speaking order. Thereafter the

employer approached the High Court by preferring a petition under Article 226 of the

Constitution seeking to quash the award of the Labour Court. On behalf of the

employee, the principal contention raised was that in view of the order of the Supreme

Court dismissing the special leave petition preferred against the award of the Labour

Court, it is not legally open to the employer to approach the High Court under Article

226 of the Constitution challenging the very same award. The High Court decided that

the doctrine of election is applicable, and the employer having chosen the remedy of

approaching a superior court and having failed therein could not thereafter resort to the

alternative remedy of approaching the High Court. This decision of the High Court was

put in issue before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that the view taken by

the High Court was not correct and that the High Court should have gone into the merits

of the Writ petition.

Referring to two earlier decisions, it was further held,

When the order passed by this Court was not a speaking one, it is not correct

to assume that this Court had necessarily decided implicitly all the questions in

relation to the merits of the award, which was under challenge before this Court

in the special leave petition. A writ proceeding is a wholly different and distinct

proceeding. Questions which can be said to have been decided by this Court

expressly, implicitly or even constructively while dismissing the special leave

petition cannot, of course, be re-opened in a subsequent writ proceeding before

the High Court. But neither on the principle of res judicata nor on any

principle of public policy analogous thereto, would the order of this Court

12

dismissing the special leave petition operate to bar the trial of identical issues

in a separate proceeding namely, the writ proceeding before the High Court

merely on the basis of an uncertain assumption that the issues must have been

decided by this Court at least by implication. It is not correct or safe to extend

the principle of res judicata or constructive res judicata to such an extent so

as to find it on mere guesswork. It is not the policy of this Court to entertain

special leave petitions and grant leave under Article 136 of the Constitution

save in those cases where some substantial question of law of general or public

importance is involved or there is manifest injustice resulting from the

impugned order or judgment. The dismissal of a special leave petition in limine

by a non-speaking order does not therefore justify any inference that by

necessary implication the contentions raised in the special leave petition on the

merits of the case have been rejected by this Court. It may also be observed that

having regard to the very heavy backlog of work in this Court and the necessity

to restrict the intake of fresh cases by strictly following the criteria

aforementioned, it has very often been the practice of this Court to grant special

leave in cases where the party cannot claim effective relief by approaching the

concerned High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. In such cases also

the special leave petitions are quite often dismissed only by passing a non-

speaking order especially in view of the rulings already given by this Court in

the two decisions afore-cited, that such dismissal of the special leave petition

will not preclude the party from moving the High Court for seeking relief under

Article 226 of the Constitution. In such cases it would work extreme hardship

and injustice if the High Court were to close its doors to the petitioner and

13

refuse him relief under Article 226 of the Constitution on the sole ground of

dismissal of the special leave petition. [emphasis added]

It is observed by this Court, that the Order in the Fundamental Rights Application

bearing No. SC/FR/170/2019 does not provide any acute reasoning as to why the leave

to appeal is refused. Hence considering all the above-stated facts and the Court

decisions, I hold that the order of the Supreme Court in the Fundamental Rights

Application does not operate as res judicata and not an impediment for the Petitioner

to maintain the instant Application seeking to exercise its Writ jurisdiction and examine

whether the impugned decision of the CEA violates the applicable SoR, existing laws

and regulations, unjust, arbitrary, improper, unlawful, illegal, wrongful or ultra vires.

The Petitioner alleges that the CEA has violated the provisions of the SoR when

appointing the Assistant Directors. As per Item No. 5.4.1. of the SoR marked as P11(a),

the written competitive examination comprises two subjects namely, Language

Proficiency and Aptitude Test. The internal memo dated 16.03.2018 marked as P7(ii)

stipulates that the candidates should sit for a Subject Knowledge paper and a General

Management Knowledge paper. Nevertheless, at the written competitive examination

the applicants had to sit for a Management Paper instead of a Language Proficiency

Paper. On 02.07.2018, 32 were appointed as Assistant Directors by the CEA and another

3 were appointed, consequent to the Fundamental Rights Application filed on

10.08.2018 by the 12th, 16th and 17th Respondents of the instant Application. Even

though the Petitioner alleges that the CEA has violated the provisions of the SoR, it is

evident from the internal memo dated 16.03.2018 marked as P7(ii), that the change of

papers has been informed to the applicants prior to conducting the written examination

on 09.04.2018. It clearly manifests that the Petitioner has accepted the changes and sat

14

for the written examination and alleges the said violations of the SoR only after the 7th

21st Respondents were appointed to the post of Assistant Directors pursuant to the

internal memo marked P17 which was issued on 17.04.2019. Instant Application was

filed on 16.12.2019 and it is therefore the view of this Court that the Petitioner has

neither questioned the alleged violations of the SoR without a delay in a proper forum

nor has explained the delay.

It was held in the case of K. A. Gunasekera Vs. T. B. Weerakoon (Assistant Government

Agent, Kurunegala)6, that,

The award was made on 17.4.69, and it was more than 7 months later that the

application was made. We consider this period far too long, and there has been

no explanation for the delay.

In Biso Menike Vs. Cyril de Alwis7 Sharvananda, J. (as then he was) held that,

a writ of certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be held to

be a writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. But exercise of this

discretion by Court is governed by well-accepted principles. The court is bound

to issue a writ at the instance of a party aggrieved by the order of an inferior

tribunal except in cases where he has disentitled himself to the discretionary

relief by reason of his own conduct, like submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue

delay or waiver.The proposition that the application for writ must be sought

as soon as injury is caused is merely an application of the equitable doctrine

that delay defeats equity and the longer the injured person sleeps over his rights

6 73 NLR 262 7 1982 (1) SLR 368 at page 377 to 378

15

without any reasonable excuse the chances of his success in a writ application

dwindle and the Court may reject a writ application on the ground of

unexplained delay.An application for a writ of certiorari should be filed

within a reasonable time from the Order which the applicant seeks to have

quashed.

In the case of Seneviratne Vs. Tissa Bandaranayake and another8, Amerasinghe, J.

adverting to the question of long delay, commented that.

if a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law refuses

afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law both to

punish his neglect, nam leges vigilantibus, non dormientibus, subveniunt, and

for other reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over their rights and are not

vigilant.

In Sarath Hulangamuwa Sriwardena Vs. The Principal Vishaka Vidyalaya9, it was held

that,

the Writs are extraordinary remedies granted to obtain speedy relief under

exceptional circumstances and time is of the essence of the application . The

laches of the petitioner must necessarily be a determining factor in deciding the

application for writ as the Court will not lend itself to making a stultifying order

which cannot be carried out.

When considering the above-stated facts and authorities, since the Petitioner has

delayed in filing this Application for nearly 8 months and has not given any reason for

8 1999(2) SLR 341 at page 351 9 (1986-1 SLR-275)

16

the same, this Court is of the view that the Petitioner is not entitled to the Writs prayed

for in the prayers C to F of the Petition to this Application. Nevertheless, this Court

direct the CEA to strictly adhere to the provisions of the SoR and its subsequent

amendments in appointing and promoting Officers in the future.

The Petitioner challenges the appointment of 18th, 19th, 20th and 21st Respondents on

the basis that the said Respondents do not possess a minimum of 5 years of experience

in the Executive Grade as a Senior Environmental Officers to be promoted to the post

of Assistant Directors. According to the SoR, external candidates were required to

possess a bachelors degree in the field of Environmental Science/ Agriculture or any

other relevant field which is recognized by the University Grants Commission and a

minimum of five-year post-qualifying experience at the Executive Level in the field of

environment after obtaining the first degree. The internal candidates were required to

possess qualifications required by the external candidates or five years of satisfactory

service as a Senior Environmental Officer/ Senior Environmental Education Officer. In

terms of Section 1.9 of Chapter II Volume I of the Establishment Code, the effective

date of an appointment or promotion is the date specified in the letter of appointment

or the date on which the officer first assumes the duties of his new post, whichever is

later. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioner argues that the 18th to 21st

Respondents did not possess a minimum of 5 years experience as Senior Environmental

Officers/ Senior Environmental Education Officers to the date of closing the

Applications, which was on 15.01.2017. However, when taking into consideration the

dates of the letter of appointment and the dates of assumption of duties it is clear that

they have assumed duties as Senior Environmental Officers/ Senior Environmental

Education Officers a few dates later than the date of appointment. Therefore, the

experience of the 18th to 21st Respondents in the post of Senior Environmental Officers/

17

Senior Environmental Education Officer should count from the date of assumption of

duties and accordingly, their experience is shorter than 5, 12, 8 and 5 days respectively.

Since it is not a considerable period which is short to 5 years, this Court cannot declare

that the said Respondents are not eligible to be promoted as Assistant Directors on the

fact that they have not completed the required 5-year period. Therefore, this Court

cannot issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st, 2nd 3rd, 22nd and/or

23rd Respondents to promote those Respondents to the posts of Assistant Director

(Environment) and the relief prayed for in prayer G to the Petition in this Application

should fail.

The CEA has appointed 32 Assistant Directors who were selected from the merit list

marked as P13 at the first instance. In terms of the internal memo marked as P7(i), a

reserve list will not be maintained based on the exam that was held on 09.04.2018 to

select candidates for the post of Assistant Director for vacancies that would be available

after 15.01.2017 and new applications would be called to fill those vacancies.

Nevertheless, the CEA appointed 7th to 21st Respondents on 17.04.2019 as Assistant

Directors based on the competitive examination and the results of the interview in the

second instance. Accordingly, those Respondents (7th to 21st Respondents) have been

selected from the merit list marked as P13. Therefore, including the 12th, 16th and 17th

Respondents who were appointed pursuant to the settlement entered in the Fundamental

rights application, altogether 50 Assistant Directors have been appointed from the merit

list marked as P13. The Petitioner in the instant Application was ranked 48th in the said

merit list. Therefore, it is the view of this Court that it is reasonable to appoint the

Petitioner also as an Assistant Director. Under the above-stated circumstances, Court

direct the CEA to appoint the Petitioner to the post of Assistant Director with effect

from the date of this Judgment.

18

Considering all the facts and circumstances, this Court decide not to grant reliefs prayed

for in prayers C to G of the Petition to this Application and to issue a Writ of Mandamus

as prayed for in prayer H to the Petition. No costs ordered.

Application partially allowed.
