Page 8 of 14

MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. The Petitioners are seeking a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 17th Respondent, Commissioner General of Motor Traffic, to register the assembled motor vehicles belonging to the Petitioners in terms of the Motor Traffic Act and/or give effect to the Cabinet Decision dated 09-11-2016 and/or give effect to the Judgment of the Supreme Court in SCFR 304/2011 dated 13-09-2012, and compelling the 19th Respondent, Sri Lanka Customs, to furnish the relevant information and documentation (Customs Link) to the 17th Respondent, if any.

Factual Matrix:

In an Application bearing No. SC.FR. No. 304/2011 (P2A), the Supreme Court on 13-09-2012, ordered the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic to grant approval to the 18th Respondent (Vehicles Lanka Private Limited) to register its business of assembling vehicles using used parts in terms of Section 241 of the Motor Traffic Act (as amended). On 09-11-2016, a Cabinet decision was taken permitting the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic to register the 2250 assembled vehicles of the 18th Respondents (P7). The said Cabinet decision mandated that the 2250 motor vehicles of the 18th Respondent had to be assembled and registered within three years from the date of the decision. By letter dated 25-10-2012 (P2B), the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic informed the 18th Respondent that, he would act in terms of the said Judgment of the Supreme Court and permit the 18th Respondent to assemble vehicles utilizing secondhand parts in terms of the powers vested in him by section 241 (5) of the Motor Traffic Act with effect from 01-11-2012.

On the strength of the said judgment of the Supreme Court, the Petitioners purchased the vehicles from the 18th Respondent on or about December 2012 to early 2013. The Petitioners were under the impression that the 18th Respondent would take the necessary steps to register the vehicles in dispute with the 17th Respondent. Since the 18th Respondent failed to take the necessary steps to have those vehicles registered, the Petitioners had taken steps for the registration. However, the 17th Respondent failed and neglected to register the said vehicles. On this premise, the Petitioners

Page 9 of 14

preferred a fundamental Rights Application before the Supreme Court in case bearing No. SCFR 134/2015 seeking, inter-alia, that their vehicles be registered with the 17th Respondent. Subsequently, pursuant to the said Cabinet decision marked as P7, the Petitioners had withdrawn the said fundamental Rights Application.

Thereafter, the 17th Respondent had taken a decision that the vehicles in dispute cannot be registered as the tax which has to be paid by the 18th Respondent has not been determined by the 19th Respondent and a final decision has not been taken by the Cabinet in this regard (P9).

In those circumstances, the Petitioners state that the failure of the 17th Respondent to register the vehicles in dispute in terms of the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act is unlawful, ultra-vires, illegal, unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious.

Contention of the Respondents:

The 17th Respondent having raised a preliminary legal objection as to the maintainability of this Application took up the position that the said Supreme Cout Judgment did not confer any rights onto the Petitioners who are not parties to that case, and therefore, the said Judgment cannot be construed as entitling the Petitioners to demand registration of their vehicles.

Observation:

The Judgment of the Supreme Court in Application bearing No. SC.FR. No. 304/2011 (P2A), reads as follows;

In terms of the settlement, the 2nd Respondent (Minister of Transport) has no objections in permitting the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic to register the business Vehicle Lanka Private Limited, the 1st Petitioner in this case, in terms of section 72 of the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Act No. 08 of 2009. This is in accordance with the policy decision taken by the Ministry of Transport, the 2nd Respondent. Furthermore, in terms of the policy decision taken by the Ministry, it is agreed with the Petitioners that the Ministry, namely the 2nd Respondent, is to direct the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic to register 2250 vehicles including the vehicles that

Page 10 of 14

have remained unsold with the Company on the date of commencement of this agreement, and which are assembled within three years thereafter by the 1st Petitioner Company using used parts. ..in terms of this judgment, the 64th Respondent (Commissioner General of Motor Traffic) could grant approval to the 1st Petitioner Company to register its business of assembling vehicles using used parts in terms of section 241 of the Motor Traffic Act as amended..

Accordingly, by letter dated 25-10-2012 (P2B), the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic informed the 18th Respondent that, he would act in terms of the said Judgment of the Supreme Court and permit the 18th Respondent to assemble vehicles utilizing secondhand parts in terms of the powers vested in him by section 241 (5) of the Motor Traffic Act with effect from 01-11-2012. Subsequently, in line with the foregoing judgment of the Supreme Court, on 09-11-2016, a Cabinet decision was taken permitting the Commissioner General of Motor Traffic to register the 2250 assembled vehicles of the 18th Respondents (P7). In this scenario, it is abundantly clear that in terms of the said Cabinet decision and the said Supreme Court judgment, the 17th Respondent has no option but to register the vehicles in dispute. The position taken up by the 17th Respondent in P9, that the said vehicles cannot be registered until the tax to be paid in respect of the said vehicles is determined and a further decision to be taken by the Cabinet in this regard is devoid of merits, violation of the said Supreme Court judgment and against the Cabinet Decision marked P7 on the part of the 17th Respondent. This Court is mindful of the fact that the 17th Respondent vehemently failed to comply with the judgment of the Supreme Court and its own decision marked as (P2B). As such, it is the considered view of this Court that the actions of the 17th Respondent are illegal, unreasonable, unlawful, arbitrary, capricious and ultra-vires.

What is legitimate expectation? This concept is focused upon the idea of fairness and the enforcement of promises or representations. This principle creates the idea that it is unlawful for a public authority to fail to abide by a promise or representation that it has made without good reason, provided that the promise

Page 11 of 14

is lawful and that whoever made the promise was entitled to bind the authority.

In Junaideen Mohamed Iqbal vs. The Divisional Secretary,

Kundasale1 the Court of Appeal simply described the principle of

legitimate expectation as follows:

When a public authority represents that it will or will not do

something within its authority and later attempts to rescind the

said representation, a person who has reasonably relied on it

should be entitled to enforce it by law. This concept is based

on the principles of natural justice and fairness, and seeks to

prevent the abuse of power by public authorities

Wade discusses the principle of legitimate expectations2 as follows:

A further and more satisfactory reason for the protection of

legitimate expectations lie in the trust that has been reposed

by the citizen in what he has been told or led to believe by the

official. Good government depends upon trust between the

governed and the governor. Unless that trust is sustained and

protected officials will not be believed and government

becomes a choice between chaos and coercion.

It is not enough that an expectation should exist: it must in

addition be legitimate. But how is it to be determined whether

a particular expectation is worthy of protection? This is a

difficult area since an expectation reasonably entertained by a

person may not be found to be legitimate because of some

countervailing consideration of policy or law. A crucial

1 CA/WRIT/328/215, CA Minutes of 19.02.2020.

2 H.W.R. Wade and C.F. Forsyth, Administrative Law, 11th Edition, p.451.

Page 12 of 14

requirement is that the assurance must itself be clear,

unequivocal and unambiguous. Many claimant fail at this

hurdle after close analysis of the assurance. The test is how

on a fair reading of the promise it would have been reasonably

understood by those to whom it was made. (Page 452).

The meaning and scope of the doctrine of legitimate expectation

was considered at length in Union of India vs. Hindustan

Development Corporation3, where it was stated that,

Time is a three-fold present: the present as we experience it,

the past as a present memory and the future as a present

expectation. For legal purposes, the expectation cannot be the

same as anticipation. It is different from a wish, desire or a

hope nor can it amount to a claim or demand on the ground of

a right. However, earnest and sincere a wish, a desire or a

hope may be and however confidently one may look to them to

be fulfilled, they by themselves cannot amount to an

assertable expectation and a mere disappointment does not

attract legal consequences. A pious hope even leading to a

moral obligation cannot amount to a legitimate expectation. The

legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded

on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure

followed in a regular and natural sequence. Again it is

distinguishable from a genuine expectation. Such expectations

should be justifiable, legitimate and protectable. Every such

legitimate expectation does not by itself fructify into a right

3 1994 AIR 988, 1993 (3) SCC 499.

Page 13 of 14

and, therefore, it does not amount to a right in a conventional

sense.

In the Application in hand, on the strength of the said Supreme Court Judgment, Cabinet decision and the consent given by the 17th Respondent the Petitioners had a very lawful expectation that their vehicles in dispute would be registered by the 17th Respondent. The Petitioners proceeded to purchase those vehicles from the 18th Respondent for the valuable consideration with that legitimate expectation. Hence, the 17th Respondent is obliged to register those vehicles as he promised in P2B.

I shall now turn to the contention of the learned DSG that the said Supreme Cout Judgment did not confer any rights on the Petitioners who are not parties to that case, and therefore, the said Judgment cannot be construed as entitling the Petitioners to demand registration of their vehicles. Indeed, in terms of the Supreme Court Judgment, the vehicles in dispute owned by the 18th Respondent can be registered with the 17th Respondent. It is understood that when those vehicles are sold by the 18th Respondent to 3rd parties, still the said vehicles are entitled to be registered in view of the said judgment. There is no intimation in the said judgment that the vehicles cannot be registered by the new owners. It is the considered view of this Court that on the strength of the said judgment of the Supreme Court and the Cabinet Decision, the Petitioners those who purchased the vehicles from the 18th Respondents are also entitled to have those vehicles registered with the 17th Respondent despite the fact that they are not parties to the said Supreme Court case. It is pertinent to note that the Petitioners who purchased the vehicles from the 18th Respondent on the strength of the Supreme Court Judgment too are entitled to enjoy the fruits of the said Judgment.

The learned DSG raised a legal objection that the present Minister of Finance is the President of Sri Lanka, and therefore, without making the Attorney General a party, no proceedings can be maintained against the President of Sri Lanka. It is to be noted that though the Minister of Finance is made a party, no relief is sought against the Minister of Finance. Substantial reliefs are sought against the Commissioner of Motor Traffic and the Department of Customs, whereas those parties are represented by

Page 14 of 14

the Attorney General. In this premise, I am of the view that the foregoing preliminary objection is technical and devoid of merits.

Conclusion:

The Petitioners have expounded large sums of money in purchasing the vehicles in dispute. Unless the said vehicles are registered with the 17th Respondent they cannot be used on the roads and motorways in Sri Lanka. The 17th Respondents, without any reason failed to register those vehicles in terms of the Supreme Court Judgment for the last 12 years. It appears to this Court that due to the arbitrary, illegal, unreasonable and malicious act of the 17th Respondent, material prejudice and hardship are caused to the Petitioners.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the Petitioners are entitled to the relief as prayed for in the prayers to the Petition. A Writ of Mandamus compelling the 17th Respondent to register the assembled motor vehicles belonging to the Petitioners in terms of the Motor Traffic Act is issued.

The 17th Respondent is ordered to register the vehicles in suit within two months from the date of this judgment, namely on or before 31-10-2024. The Petitioners are entitled to a sum of Rs. 10,000/- each, payable by the 17th Respondent as costs of this proceedings.

Application allowed with costs.
