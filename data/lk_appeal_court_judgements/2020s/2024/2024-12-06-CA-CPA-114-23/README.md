for the Applicant-Petitioner-Petitioner-Petitioner

Argued on : 13-09-2024

Sampath B Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the applicant-petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter referred

to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction granted to this

Court in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution.

When this matter was supported before this Court, having considered the facts

and the circumstances, this Court decided to issue notice on the respondent-

respondent. However, despite the notice being issued and it being not returned,

the respondent-respondent-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

respondent) failed to appear before this Court and make any submission in

regard to the application filed by the petitioner.

At the hearing, this Court heard to the submissions of the learned Counsel for

the petitioner in this regard.

This is a matter where the petitioner has initiated proceedings before the

Magistrates Court of Mahiyanganaya, under case number 34197 seeking relief

in terms of the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act No. 34 of 2005 against the

respondent who is her legally married husband.

In her petition before the Magistrates Court, the petitioner has indicated her

matrimonial home as the house situated at No.13, Puhulyaya, Mahiyanganaya.

Her complaint had been to the effect that due to the continuous domestic

violence towards her by the respondent, she was forced to leave the house

together with her son and was forced to seek shelter in her mothers home.

After having examined her under oath, the learned Magistrate of Mahiyanganaya

has initially issued an interim protection order against the respondent

prohibiting him from entering the matrimonial home.

After a due inquiry held in that regard, the learned Magistrate of Mahiyanganaya

of his order dated 31-03-2021 has decided to issue a protection order as the Act

provides, in order to prevent the domestic violence on the petitioner by the

respondent. In his order, the learned Magistrate has directed that the respondent

is prohibited from entering the house of the mother of the petitioner on the basis

that the petitioner is living in that house, and has decided against ordering the

respondent to leave the matrimonial home.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner has filed an application of

revision before the Provincial High Court of Uva Province holden in Badulla,

without invoking the statutory guaranteed remedy of filing an appeal before the

said High Court in terms of section 17 of the Prevention Domestic Violence Act.

The learned High Court Judge of Badulla after having considered the application

has concluded that he does not find sufficient exceptional grounds to interfere

with the order of the learned Magistrate of Badulla, and has concluded that the

learned Magistrate has pronounced a proper order in order to prevent the

incidents of domestic violence complained by the petitioner to the Magistrates

Court. Accordingly, the revision application has been dismissed.

It is on the basis of being aggrieved of the said judgment of the learned High

Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Uva Province holden in Badulla, the

petitioner had preferred this application in revision to this Court.

Although this Court considered the application filed by the petitioner on its

merit, this Court finds that in terms of section 10(2) of the Prevention of Domestic

Violence Act, any protection order issued shall remain in force for a period of

not exceeding 12 months only.

The relevant section 10(2) reads as follows;

10(2). A Protection Order shall remain in force for a period not

exceeding 12 months as specified therein.

Hence, it is the considered view of this Court that pronouncing a judgment on

this matter would be only be of an academic interest since the protection order

made by the learned Magistrate of Mahiyanganaya on 31-03-2021 will no longer

have any validity before the law.

Since this Court does not find a basis to pronounce a judgment on any questions

of law based on the facts relevant to this case, this Court finds no reasons to

interfere with the Judgment pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of

Badulla and also the order made by the learned Magistrate of Mahiyanganaya.

Accordingly, the revision application is dismissed for the reasons considered

above on the basis that pronouncing a judgment in this regard would be a futile

exercise.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this order to the Provincial

High Court of the Uva Province holden in Badulla, and to the Magistrates Court

of Mahiyanganaya for information.
