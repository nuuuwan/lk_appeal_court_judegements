JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam J

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General for committing two counts

of murder of Madarasinhage Chandrawathi and Madarasinhage Padmawathi

on or about 22/08/2008 an offence punishable under Section 296 of Penal

Code.

Following a jury trial, the learned Trial Judge convicted the Appellant on both

counts of murder and sentenced him to death on 12/08/2016.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court seeking to set aside the conviction and

sentence imposed on him. Deceased is the wife of the Appellant.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. During the argument

he was connected via zoom from prison.

CA/HCC/166/16

The following Grounds of Appeal are raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The Appellant was denied a fair trial guaranteed by Article 13(3) of the

Constitution due to the following reasons:

I. The Registrar of the High Court announced the verdict of the

Jury before the Foreman of the Jury announced their verdict.

II. The learned High Court Judge had refused the application of

the Appellant to call the Magistrate who conducted the inquest

in this case.

2. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting the Jury

as to the standard of proof.

3. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting the Jury

as to the evidential value of the dock statement of the Appellant.

4. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting the Jury

that the weakness of the defence case would establish the prosecution

case.

5. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting the Jury

about the dying declaration.

6. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting the Jury

about the Section 27(1) recovery of the Evidence Ordinance.

7. The learned High Court Judge misdirected the Jury regarding culpable

homicide not amounting to murder.

8. The verdict of the Jury is against the evidence led at the trial.

Background of the case

On the day of the incident around 9.30am when PW1 Appuhamy and PW2

Sumanasena were working outside the deceaseds house, PW1 heard

someone shouting menna maranawa. When PW1 and PW2 had rushed

near the deceaseds house after hearing the cries, they had seen the deceased

CA/HCC/166/16

4 | P a g e

Padmawathi lying fallen on the paving around the house and the Appellant

standing a little further away carrying a crowbar. When he went near

Padmawathie, she had uttered Aru Jagath, Jagath. Thereafter, PW1 had

gone to the police station to inform the incident.

The Appellant made a dock statement and denied the charges. According to

him when he came home, he had had a bath and afterwards he had seen

both the deceased persons and he had raised cries. Hearing his cries PW1

and PW2 had arrived at the scene. In this case, although he was named as

a prosecution witness, PW2 was not called on behalf of the prosecution. But

he was called as a defence witness by the Appellant.

Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Fourth, Fifth,

Sixth, Seventh, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States

Constitution, and Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights, in

addition to numerous other constitutions and declarations throughout the

world set out the various rights associated with a fair trial. It is a trial which

is conducted fairly, justly and with procedural regularity by an impartial

judge.

Similarly, according to Article 13(3) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka every

Accused person has a right to a fair trial. Additionally, Section 14(1) of the

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) also guarantees

the right to a fair trial. Hence, the right to a fair trial is an international

concept guaranteed to the all across the world.

Under the first ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the Registrar

of the High Court announced the verdict of the jury, before the Foreman

announced the verdict.

The procedure of announcing the verdict of the Jury is laid down under

Section 234 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

CA/HCC/166/16

5 | P a g e

Sub-Section (4) of Section 234 states:

On this the foreman shall state what is the verdict of the Jury.

But in this case, the Registrar of the High Court read out the charges which

have been levelled against the Appellant, and informed the learned High

Court Judge, that the Jury has unanimously found the Appellant guilty of

the stated charges. The relevant portion of the proceeding is re-produced

below:

Highlighting the above portions of the proceeding, the Counsel for the

Appellant strenuously argue that this not a mere procedural error, but this

is an illegality which cannot be cured by applying Section 334(1) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act.

In this case, the Registrar had become involved only at the point where the

foreman should have announced the verdict. She had not involved herself in

any manner in deciding the outcome of the case.

In King v Martin 31 NLR 124 Lyall Grant J. held that:

Under section 249 (3) a verdict can be amended only before or

immediately after the verdict is recorded, i.e., before the jurors have left

the Court and while they are still under the observance of the presiding

Judge.

CA/HCC/166/16

7 | P a g e

The law provides that the verdict may be amended by the jury either

before it is signed or immediately thereafter. The section only allows

the verdict to be altered if the mistake is immediately brought to the notice

of the jury. I find in the comments to section 304 of the Indian Act given in

Sohoni's Code of Criminal Procedure that the law is set forth as follows: -''

The section for an amendment of a- wrong verdict delivered by accident or

mistake clearly contemplates that such a verdict is amended only before

or immediately after it is recorded; in other words, before the jurors have

left the Court and while they are still under the observance of the presiding

Judge.

This case was decided under the old Criminal Procedure Code of Sri Lanka.

In this case as per the case record, although the Appellant was pronounced

not guilty to the second charge, it was immediately corrected by the foreman

of the jury. Further, the learned High Court Judge had proceeded only after

clearing the confusion by directing pertinent questions to the foreman and

taking due steps to receive the verdict clearly, which is that the Appellant is

guilty of both charges. Importantly, this had been done before the jury rose

and was officially dispersed. Therefore, this is my considered view that the

corrected verdict did not cause any prejudice to the Appellant nor has he

been deprived of a fair trial.

Further the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the

Constitution of our country provide provisions to rectify any error, omission,

or irregularity in a judgment where such error, omission or irregularity which

has not prejudiced the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a failure

of justice.

CA/HCC/166/16

8 | P a g e

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No: 15 of 1979 states as

follows:

Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account-

(a) of any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrants, charge, judgment, summing up or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

Unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has

occasioned a failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

Article 138 of The Constitution of Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka

states:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an

appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact

or in law which shall be 111 [committed by the High

Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original

jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance], tribunal or

other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by

way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things

112 [of which such High Court, Court of First Instance]

tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgment, decree, or order of any

court shall be revised or varied on account of any

error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

CA/HCC/166/16

9 | P a g e

the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

Under the same ground the Appellant contended that his request to call the

learned Magistrate who had conducted inquest proceedings had been turned

down unreasonably and therefore the Appellant was deprived of a fair trial.

The procedure of conducting a trial either with or without a jury had been

laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. The

procedure laid down in the CPC should apply equally to both parties. Hence,

following the correct procedure is vital to avoid confusion in a trial.

In this case, the learned Counsel for the Appellant made his application

without filing a list of the defence witnesses. Further, he had made this

application before the closure of the prosecution and before calling for

defence by the Court. The Application was to call the learned Magistrate who

conducted the inquest via a telephone call at 15:20 hours on 09.08.2016.

Considering the premature nature of the application and the inducement to

adopt an irregular procedure by the defence, the learned High Court Judge

by her order dated 09.08.2016 had accurately refused the said application.

The relevant order of the learned High Court Judge is re-produced below:

Therefore, I see no irregularity or prejudice caused to the Appellant. He has

not been deprived of a fair trial.

Under the second ground of appeal the learned Counsel argued that the

learned High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting the Jury as to the

standard of proof.

CA/HCC/166/16

11 | P a g e

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread as discussed in Woolmington v. DPP

[1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

In Hakkini Asela De Silva and two others v The Attorney General SC

Appeal No. 14/2011 decided on Saleem Marsoof, J. held that:

It is trite law that, in criminal proceedings, the burden of proof is always

on the prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused person beyond

reasonable doubt, and the burden never shifts to the defence. The

prosecution has the duty to prove all, and not merely some, of the

ingredients of the offence charged beyond reasonable doubt

The learned Counsel for the Appellant highlighting a portion of the opening

address (Pages 85-86 of the brief) and a portion of summing-up (Page 768)

of the learned High Court Judge in his written submission, complains that

the learned High Court Judge had confused the meaning of Beyond a

reasonable doubt in the portion of the proceedings extracted above.

But on perusal of the portions of the proceedings highlighted in the written

submission of the Appellant, I could not see any confusion created by the

learned High Court Judge. She had used very simple language and simple

examples to explain what is meant by Beyond a reasonable doubt in her

opening and closing summations. As accurately submitted by the learned

Deputy Solicitor General, basic legal principles and concepts such as

CA/HCC/166/16

12 | P a g e

presumption of innocence, burden of proof, beyond a reasonable doubt,

admissible evidence, facts in issue and relevant facts are properly described

with examples by the learned High Court Judge in her opening address and

in summing-up.

Under the third ground of appeal the learned Counsel contended that the

learned High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting the Jury as to the

evidential value of the Appellants dock statement.

The Counsel for the Appellant extended his argument that the learned High

Court Judge has not properly explained the evidentiary value of a dock

statement in her summing-up. Further she had failed to direct the jury that,

if the dock statement creates a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case,

the defence must succeed.

The following judgements are very important as it laid down guidelines to

show how it can be treated as evidence in a criminal trial

In Queen v. Buddharakkitha Thero 63 NLR 433 the court held that:

The right of an accused person to make an unsworn statement

from the dock is recognised in our law (King v. Vellayan[10 (1918)

20 N. L. R. 251-at 266.].) That right would be of no value unless

such a statement is treated as evidence on behalf of the accused

subject however to the infirmity which attaches to statements that

are unsworn and have not been tested by cross-examination.

In Queen v. Kularatne 71 NLR 529 the court held that:

We are in respectful agreement and are of the view that such a

statement must be looked upon as evidence subject to the

infirmity that the accused had deliberately refrained from giving

CA/HCC/166/16

13 | P a g e

sworn testimony, and the jury must be so informed. But the jury

must also be directed that;

a) If they believe the unsworn statement, it must be acted

upon.

b) If it raised a reasonable doubt in their minds about the case

for the prosecution, the defense must succeed,

c) That it should not be used against another accused.

Although the learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that the learned

High Court Judge had not given proper directions with regard to the dying

declaration, but had given proper direction in her summing-up. The relevant

portions are re-produced below:

Page 810 of the brief.

Considering above portions of evidence highlighted, it is incorrect to say that

the learned High Court Judge had misdirected the jury as to the evidentiary

value of the Appellants dock statement.

Under the fourth ground of appeal the learned Counsel for the Appellant

contended that the learned High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting

CA/HCC/166/16

14 | P a g e

the Jury that the weakness of the defence case would establish the

prosecution case.

In Kalinga Padmatilake alias Sergent Elpitiya v The Director General,

Commission to Investigate Allegations SC Appeal No. 99/2007 the Court

held that:

The prosecution must stand or fall on its own legs and it cannot derive

any strength from the weakness in the defence, and when the guilt of the

accused is not established beyond reasonable doubt, he is liable to be

acquitted as a matter of right and not as matter of grace or favour

The learned Counsel for the Appellant only citing a portion of summing-up

pertaining to the explanation regarding the defence case at page 796 of the

brief, complains to this Court that the learned High Court Judge has

provided a serious misdirection with regard to the weakness of the defence

case.

I am of the view that it is very important to consider the entire paragraph at

page 796 as against the portion highlighted by the Appellants on the same

page of the brief to come to a conclusion whether the learned High Court

Judge has misdirected the jury with regard to the weakness of the defence

case. The relevant paragraph at page 796 is re-produced below:

Considering the entire paragraph mentioned above in the summing-up, the

learned High Court Judge had not misdirected the jury with regard to the

weakness of the defence case at all.

Under the fifth ground of appeal the contention of the Appellant is that the

learned High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting the Jury about the

dying declaration.

As in this case the prosecution relies on the dying declaration made by the

deceased, it is very important to discuss the relevant laws pertaining to the

acceptance of dying declarations as evidence in criminal trials under our law.

According to Section 32(1) of Evidence Ordinance;

Statements, written, or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is

dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving

evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of

delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, appears to

the court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following

cases: -

(1) when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his

death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which

CA/HCC/166/16

16 | P a g e

resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that persons

death comes into question.

Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or

was not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death,

and whatever may be the nature of the proceedings in which the cause

of his death comes into question.

The following requirements must necessarily be established before any

evidence is led under section 32(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

1. That the maker of the statement is dead.

2. That the statement made by the deceased refers to his/her cause of

death or to the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in

his/her death.

Hence such evidence would become admissible only where the cause of death

of the person making the statement is in question in the particular judicial

proceedings. Admissibility of such evidence would ultimately be decided by

the trial judge as per Section 136 of the Evidence Ordinance.

In Dharmawansa Silva and Another v. The Republic of Sri Lanka [1981]

2 Sri.L.R.439 it was held:

When a dying statement is produced, three questions arise for the Court.

Firstly, whether it is authentic. Secondly if it is authentic whether it is

admissible in whole or part. Thirdly, the value of the whole or part that is

admitted. A dying deposition is not inferior evidence but it is wrong to give

it added sanctity

CA/HCC/166/16

17 | P a g e

In Sigera v Attorney General [2011] 1 Sri.L.R. 201 it was held that:

An accused can be convicted of murder based mainly and solely on a

dying declaration made by a deceased.

The main contention of the Appellant is that the learned High Court Judge

had misdirected the jury about the admissibility of dying declarations made

by the deceased Padmawathi to PW1. Upon the perusal of the Summing-Up

at page 782 the learned High Court Judge had provided proper directions

with regard to the admissibility of the dying declaration of the deceased

Padmawathi. The relevant paragraph is re-produced below:

Considering the Summing-Up pertaining to the Dying Declaration, the

learned High Court Judge had given reasonable directions regarding the

admissibility of the Dying Declaration of the deceased Padmawathi.

Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the leaned High Court Judge had

misdirected the jury with regard to the Dying Declaration.

Under the sixth ground of appeal, the Appellant contends that the learned

High Court Judge erred in law by misdirecting the Jury about the recovery

made under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

The prosecution had produced a crow bar (w,jx.=j) as a production which

had been recovered under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance. However,

the Counsel for the Appellant submits that the recovery evidence consists of

a lot of infirmities and doubtful circumstances which the learned Trial Judge

failed to put to the jury in her Summing-Up.

According to Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance-

Provided that, when any fact is deposed to as discovered in

consequence of information received from a person accused of any

offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of such information,

whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the

fact thereby discovered may be proved.

The Supreme Court in the case of Somaratne Rajapakse Others v. Hon.

Attorney General (2010) 2 Sri L.R. 113 at 115 stated that:

A vital limitation on the scope of Section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance is that only the facts which are distinctly related to

what has been discovered would be permitted in evidence. 'There

should be a clear nexus between the information given by the

accused and the subsequent discovery of a relevant fact. A

discovery made in terms of Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance

discloses that the information given was true and that the

Accused had knowledge of the existence and the whereabouts of

the actual discovery.

The learned High Court Judge had given a very clear guideline as to the

utilization of recovery evidence under Section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance. The relevant portion of the Summing-Up is re-produced below:

Immediately after providing the above said guidelines, the learned High

Court Judge had very correctly analysed the evidence of PW5 and PW6 the

JMOs who held the post mortem examinations on the deceased persons and

expressed opinion about the injuries on the body of the deceased persons

and its possible connection to the murder weapon, the crow bar. The learned

High Court Judge in her Summing-up accurately explained the evidence

given by both JMOs and their opinion regarding the murder weapon.

Further, she had correctly dealt with the recovery evidence through the

investigating officer and directed the jury to consider those evidence to come

to their verdict. Hence, it is incorrect to say that the learned High Court

Judge had not put any doubtful circumstances to the jury.

Under the seventh ground of appeal the appellant contends that the learned

High Court Judge misdirected the Jury regarding culpable homicide not

amounting to murder.

The learned High Court Judge, had accurately and extensively explained to

the jury the difference between murder and culpable homicide not

amounting to murder, in her Summing-Up at 800-803 of the brief. There is

no any misdirection as contended by the Counsel for the Appellant.

Under the final ground of appeal, the Appellant complains that the verdict of

the Jury is against the evidence led at the trial.

Considering the instructions and the directions given to the jury by the

learned High Court Judge in her summing-Up, the jury has come to a correct

verdict. Upon consideration of the evidence presented and the Summing-Up,

I conclude that no other possible verdict other than the verdict of guilty.

Hence, all appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are devoid any merit.

CA/HCC/166/16

21 | P a g e

When the evidence presented against the Appellant is considered I conclude

that the prosecution had succeeded in adducing highly incriminating

evidence against the Appellant and thereby established the charge beyond

reasonable doubt. As such I conclude that this is not an appropriate case in

which to interfere with the findings of the jury and the sentence imposed by

the learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya dated 12/08/2016. Hence, the

appeal is dismissed.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgement to the High Court of

Embilipitiya along with the original case record.
