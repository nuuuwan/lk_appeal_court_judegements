By letter dated 06-09-2019 (P4), the 3rd Respondent informed the OIC of the Police Station, Hambantota to take steps to prevent the Petitioner from constructing a parapet wall along the northern boundary of the said land until the disputed boundary is identified. The Petitioner states that in terms of the title plan made by the Surveyor General marked as P5, the boundaries of the land in suit are specified and there is no encroachment by the Petitioner. Thereafter, under Section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 (as amended), the 3rd Respondent issued a Quit Notice to the Petitioner ordering him to hand over vacant possession of the land in dispute to the 3rd Respondent (P6). The Petitioner states that the issuance of the Quit Notice was actuated by malice and motivated by a revengeful intent towards the Petitioner, who remains in lawful occupation of the state land under a valid permit. The 3rd Respondent, by letter dated 04-03-2020 (P7), issued a notice under section 106 of the Land Development Ordinance to the Petitioner to revoke the said Permit on the basis that the latter had violated the conditions stipulated therein (P7a). Thereupon, the Petitioner informed the 3rd Respondent that he had not violated the conditions set out in P1. By letter dated 25-09-2020, the 3rd Respondent informed the Petitioner that the said Permit has been canceled (P8 and P8a). Subsequently, the Petitioner preferred appeals to the 1st and 2nd Respondents (Commissioner of Lands-Battaramulla and Southern Provincial Land Commissioner) with regard to the cancellation of his permit (P10 and P11).
