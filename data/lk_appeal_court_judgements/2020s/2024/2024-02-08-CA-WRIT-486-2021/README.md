Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioner in the instant Application seeks a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari

quashing the decision, marked P9, made on 05.08.2021 by the 1st Respondent -

Commissioner General of Labour. The said Order has been issued in terms of section 6 of the

Termination of Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No.45 of 1971

(TEWA). In the said Order P9 the 1st Respondent has decided that the Petitioner had

terminated the services of the 3rd Respondent, without the written consent of the 3rd

Respondent or the prior written approval of the Commissioner of Labour (Commissioner).

Additionally, the Petitioner has been directed to pay a sum of Rs.450,000 to the 3rd

Respondent as compensation.

The services of the 3rd Respondent had been terminated with effect from 16.05.2020 by way

of a letter dated 17.04.2020 marked P5(c). The Petitioners main contention is that the 3rd

Respondent is not entitled to any relief under TEWA as his employment was terminated

during his probationary period. The Petitioners argue that there cannot be automatic

confirmation in respect of the probationary period of the 3rd Respondent given the relevant

contract of employment and according to the Common Law relating to probationers. The

Petitioner advances its arguments based on the following provisions in Clause 8 of the Letter

of Appointment marked P2. It reads as follows:

Your employment shall be on probationary basis for a minimum period of six (06) months from

the date of Appointment.

The management also specifically reserves the right to extend your period of probation by further

term of three (03) months, if they see fit to do so.

Page 3 of 12

On completion of this probationary period, the Management, if satisfied with your work,

performance honesty, integrity, discipline and standards, etc. will confirm your appointment in

writing. In the event of your appointment not being confirmed in writing after 12 months from

the date of Appointment your services will be deemed to be confirmed with effect from the date of

expiry of your probationary period or at the end of the extended period of probation. (if

applicable).

During your probationary period this employment may be terminated by either party by giving

to the other one (01) months notice or one (01) months salary in lieu of such notice.

The primary viewpoint of the Petitioner in the instant Application is that the Common Law

principles relating to the respective rights and limitations of the employer and workman,

where the workman is a probationer are not overridden by the TEWA.

Firstly, I must consider whether the services of an employee who is on probation can be

terminated for reasons other than those arising out of an appropriate assessment in respect of

the performance and conduct of such an employee.

The 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents heavily rely on the precedence laid down in Lanka Canneries

v. Commissioner of Labour CA/WRIT/385/2021 decided on 31.08.2022. This Court in the said

case held that:

Hence, I take the view that when an employer takes a decision to extend the

probationary period or to terminate the services, he should follow a procedure,

according to law, where such decision-making power may not infringe the Rule of

Law and the principles of Natural Justice. In light of the above, I hold that any

employer should mandatorily follow an effective procedure right throughout the

period of probation if an employer needs to enjoy the benefit of not confirming

probationers as per the propositions in the aforesaid judgements cited by the Petitioner.

Further, it is abundantly clear that no employee can escape without giving reasons

under section 2(5) of TEWA. (p.05)

Furthermore, it is my considered view that in order to terminate the services of an

employee during the probationary period or to extend such probationary period, any

employer should adopt a reasonable procedure according to law. (p.04)

Page 4 of 12

It is noted that this Court has pronounced the Judgement of the above Lanka Canneries case

analyzing the purported argument that the employer has a right to terminate the services of

the probationer without assigning any reason and that the probationer has no right to be

confirmed in his service. In such analysis, this Court has well considered the judgments of

Hettiarachchi vs. Vidyalankara University 76 NLR 47, Ceylon Cement Corporation vs. Fernando

(1990) 1 Sri. L.R. 361, Priyadarshana and two others vs. Lanka Ports Authority (2008) 2 Sri. L.R.

208, Moosajees Limited vs. Rasiah (1986) 1 Sri. L.R. 365, Brown & Company Limited vs.

Samarasekara (1996) 1 Sri. L.R. 334, 335, Liyanagamage vs. Road Construction and Development

Private Limited (1994) 2 Sri. L.R. 230, State Distilleries Corporation vs. Rupasinghe (1994) 2 Sri.

L.R. 395., Ceylon Ceramic Corporation vs. Premadasa (1986) 1 Sri. L.R. 287 which were cited

on behalf of the said Lanka Canneries.

In arriving at the above decisions in the Lanka Canneries case the Court has considered the

nature of an employee on probation. A similar approach has been taken by this Court even in

the case of K. A. D. T. Kulawansa v. University of Moratuwa and Others CA/WRIT/111/2022

decided on 17.11.2022. Having regard to this approach, Court has further decided in the Lanka

Canneries case:

Therefore, my view is that when a workman (workman or an employee who comes

within the scheduled employment in TEWA) is serving during the probationary

period, the employers duty is not only to assess the employee but also to provide

necessary training, guidance and supervisory support to the employee. More than

anything, it is the mandatory duty of the employer to complete a formal review of the

performance of the employee by the end of the probationary period stipulated in the

letter of appointment. It is vital that the outcome of the review be communicated to

the employee. (p.04)

In the same vein, this Court held Chandima Sudeshika Kumari Dissanayake v. Uva Provincial

Council and Others CA/WRIT/28/2021 decided on 10.10.2023 that;

The clear purpose of extending the period of probation beyond three years is to

provide opportunities for such officers to diligently engage in improving their

performances during such an extended period. Thus, it can be clearly assumed that the

Page 5 of 12

extension of probationary period was eventually in favor of this Petitioner and such

extension should not be used as a tool to seek from Court to employ the doctrine of

ultra vires or any other ground of review in order to obtain reliefs as prayed for in the

prayer of the Petition. This is especially because the Petitioner is not adequately

impugning the reasons given by the Respondents to extend her period of probation but

challenging only the extension per se.

In line with the precedence laid down by the aforementioned cases, it is well established that

the services of a workman who is on probation cannot be terminated without assigning a

reason in respect of his/her conduct, performance etc. Furthermore, the employer should

assess the probationer's progress by adopting reasonable criteria.

On a careful perusal of the letter of termination marked P5(c), it is abundantly clear that the

Petitioner has terminated the services of the 3rd Respondent without his prior consent in

writing or prior written approval of the said Commissioner. In this regard, the following

paragraphs in the said P5(c) is vital.

During a serious global crisis like this, we must take immediate steps to survive financially, until

the world returns to normalcy. Whilst many organizations failed to disburse salaries for the

month of March, Timex paid the full salary well before the due date. However, we regrettably

note that the Company is not financially capable of continuing to make such payments, as there

is no cash inflows meet our expenses. This situation is totally unforeseen, completely beyond our

control and not anticipated by any of us.

In this context, the absence of work caused by external reasons and the current lockdown has

frustrated the employment contract between us. These exceptional circumstances and financial

emergency faced by the Company has completely changed the opportunities for employment in

our Company.

As you are aware, you are currently employed by us in a probationary capacity, in terms of your

Contract of Employment. In view of the above situation, we are compelled to treat your

probationary employment with us as frustrated, and or to terminate same, with. effect from 16th

May 2020. You will of course be paid all your accrued entitlements in full up to the date of

termination.

Page 6 of 12

Thus, it is crystal clear that the 3rd Respondents services have been terminated due to financial

distress of the Petitioner - Company and not by arriving at an independent decision by the

Petitioner concerning matters such as work, performance honesty, integrity, discipline and

standards of the 3rd Respondent. J.A.N. De Silva J. (as he was then) in Magpeck Exports Ltd v.

Commissioner of Labour and Others (2000) 2 Sri L.R. 308 (CA) has held that the doctrine of

frustration has no application; where one party and not the other foresees the events which

are said to have frustrated the contract that party is not entitled to plead frustration. Magpeck

Exports Ltd has filed the respective Writ application dealing with the provisions of TEWA.

At this juncture, I must examine the Petitioners assertions that the TEWA does not apply to

a workman on probation as a result of the Common Law principles. The Petitioner claims

that the law makes it clear that the Common Law in that area will always be presumed to be

in effect unless there is a deliberate and unequivocal intention to change or discard the

Common Law as appearing from a Statute. In other words, the Petitioner argues that the

TEWA does not specifically deal with probationers, and hence would not have intended to

disturb the Common Law relating to workmen on probation.

Referring to two authors (namely S.R.De Silva1 and S.Egalahewa2) and certain portions of

the judgements in Singer Industries (Pvt) Ltd v. CMU and Others SC/Appeal 78/08 decided on

07.10.2010 (reported in XVII B.A.L.R 161), Wijenaike v. Air Lanka Limited and Other 1990 1

Sri L.R. 293, The Lanka Estate Workers Union v. The Superintendent, Hewagama Estate S.C.

(SCM) 7-9/69, Jayasuriya v. Sri Lanka Plantation Corporation (1995 2 Sri L.R. 407) the

Petitioner tends to advance an argument that:

a. the Roman-Dutch Law is the Common Law in Sri Lanka

b. the Common Law of Sri Lanka governs the relationship of master and servant

Moreover, the Petitioner brings to the attention of this Court the cases of Brown & Co. Ltd v.

Samarasekara (1996) 1 Sri L.R. 334, Hettiarachchi v. Vidyalankara University 76 N.L.R. 47 and

State Distilleries Corporation v. Rupasinghe (1994) 2 Sri L.R., 395. The crux of the argument

relied on by the Petitioner based on those judgements is that:

1 The Contract of Employment (Reprint 2012) at p.6 2 A General Guide to Sri Lanka Labour Law (1st Edition, Stamford Lake) at p.8

Page 7 of 12

a) as per the contract of employment and the Common Law relating to

probationers, there was no automatic confirmation on his post

b) under the Common Law of Sri Lanka, the period of probation continues until

confirmation either in writing, or until circumstances arise that establish that

the period of probation must necessarily have come to an end.

What is meant by Common Law? What is the Common Law in Sri Lanka?; are essential

issues which need to be considered in this Judgement.

The learned State Counsel who appeared for the 1st, 2nd and 4th Respondents referring to

Encyclopdia Britannica submits that:

...........Common Law is generally defined as 'the body of customary law, based upon judicial

decisions and embodied in reports of decided cases, that has been administered by the common-

law courts of England since the Middle Ages. From it has evolved the type of legal system now

found also in the United States and in most of the member states of the Commonwealth (formerly

the British Commonwealth of Nations).

The learned State Counsel, in addition to the above, has cited the case of Vasantha Kumara v.

Skypan Asia (Pvt) Ltd. (2008) 1 S.L.R 324 where Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake J. (as she was

then) has observed;

It is to be noted that although this position would have been correct under the common law,

where either party was entitled to terminate the contract of employment in accordance with its

provisions without any consequential effect, the introduction of Labour Laws had modified this

position.Through the establishment of the Labour Tribunals, the common law concepts dealing

with labour relations were changed, and the Industrial Disputes Act, as stated earlier, expressly

provided for a Labour Tribunal to take action, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the

contract of service between an employer and his employee.

In order to substantially answer the question of what is meant by the Common Law? I wish

to draw my attention to the following paragraph by Glanville Williams in Learning the Law

(1963) (7th Edition, Stevens & Sons) p.p.24-25

Page 8 of 12

The phrase "the common law" seems at first a little bewildering in use because it is always used

to point a contrast, and its precise meaning depends upon the contrast that is being pointed. An

analogy may perhaps make this clearer. Take the word "layman." In the foregoing paragraph

the word was used to mean a person who is not a lawyer. But when we speak of ecclesiastics and

laymen, we mean by "laymen" non-ecclesiastics. When we speak of doctors and laymen, we mean

by "laymen" non-doctors. Laymen, in short, are people who do not belong to the particular

profession that we are speaking of. Again, take "aliens." In England if we speak of " aliens" we

generally mean by that word people who are not British subjects. But in France the French

equivalent of the word would mean people who are not French subjects, and so on for other

countries.

It is somewhat similar with "the common law." (1) Originally this meant the law that was not

local law, that is, the law that was common to the whole of England. This may still be its

meaning in a particular context, but it is not the usual meaning. More usually the phrase will

signify (2) the law that is not the result of legislation, that is, the law created by the custom of the

people and decisions of the judges. Within certain narrow limits, popular custom creates law,

and so (within much wider limits) do the decisions of the courts, which we call precedents. When

the phrase " the common law" is used in this sense it may include even local law (in the form of

local custom), which in meaning (1) is not common law. Again, (3) the phrase may mean the

law that is not equity; in other words it may mean the law developed by the old courts of common

law as distinct from the system (technically called " equity") developed by the old Court of

Chancery. In this sense "the common law" may even include statutory modifications of the

common law, though in the previous sense it does not. Finally, (4) it may mean the law that is

not foreign law-in other words, the law of England, or of other countries (such as America) that

have adopted English law. In this sense it is contrasted with (say) Roman law or French law,

and in this sense it includes the whole of English law even local customs, legislation and equity.

It will thus be seen that the precise shade of meaning in which this chameleon phrase is used

depends upon the particular context, and upon the contrast that is being made. When I said in

the second sentence of this chapter that our law is made up of common law, equity and legislation,

I meant it in a mixture of senses (2) and (3), as the context itself showed.

Through my wide reading I have observed that the approach taken by various scholars on the

term Common Law do not show any conclusive point of view in regards to the said term.

According to L.J.M. Cooray (An Introduction to the legal System of Sri Lanka, Stanford Lake

2003 - 3rd print, p.95) Sri Lanka has been influenced by South African developments, and

South African case law and academic writing has influenced our judges and academics; the

basic reason is of course that in both countries Roman Dutch Law is the residuary law. In this

backdrop, I am inclined to refer to the relationship drawn by H. R. Hahlo and Ellison Kahn

(The Union of South Africa. The Development of Its Laws and Constitutions, 1960 Stevens &

Sons Ltd., pp.47,50-51)3 between the Roman Dutch Law and the English Law which are

considered as composites of the modern South African Law.

"Following in the grand tradition of the text writers of the Roman-Dutch era, our great South

African judges have built and are continuing to build out of the two components of our law a

legal system which is adapted to the conditions of South Africa, eschewing both the archaisms of

the old Dutch law and the technicalities of the English law. And it can confidently be expected

that as our own body of jurisprudence grows, reference to the old writers will become less and less

necessary. It has been rightly said that the law of any country can be found in the last thirty years

of its law reports. This stage of certainty has not as yet been reached in South Africa, but the time

is undoubtedly approaching when reference to the old writers will be the exception rather than

the rule.

South African law today is no longer an importation from Holland or England or any other

country, but a sturdy indigenous growth with its roots firmly in the soil of South Africa. It is

South African law, "made by South Africans for South Africans". We may as well get used to

calling it by its proper name. "I consider" said Classen, J.P. in R.v.Goseb,4 "that the term

'Roman-Dutch Law' is confusing, for in fact the common law of the Union or for that matter of

the Cape of Good Hope is not Roman-Dutch law. It is South African common law".

On perusal of several legal literature illustrating the term Common Law, I take the view that

I should adopt here the wisdom of Hahlo and Kahn as described above. With the current

socio-economic trends and developments in the Country, including the laws made by the

3 Also see: An Introduction to the legal System of Sri Lanka, Stanford Lake 2003 - 3rd print, p.101 4 [1956 (2) S.A. 696, 698 (S.W.A.)]

Page 10 of 12

legislature and the judges, the traditional definitions given to the phrase Common Law (which

are distinct to each other) should be constructively redefined. In this regard, L.J.M. Cooray5

emphasizes that the case of "Kodeeswaran v. The Attorney General 6 is a pointer which could

enable the legal fraternity in Sri Lanka to move away from the old formulation of the Roman-

Dutch law as the common law, and to think in terms not of Roman-Dutch or English law and

of the antithesis between Roman-Dutch law and English law in our legal system - and to

recognize that there is a body of law, in the decisions of our courts, a body of law not English

nor Roman-Dutch but which is the creation of our courts and which in Lord Diplock's words

in the Kodeeswaran case may be called 'the indigenous common law' of Sri Lanka."

It is paramount to note that Lord Diplock has recognized in the said Kodeeswaran case the

power of the Courts to develop the law to suit changing circumstances and also give effect to

a local practice without abruptly applying the Roman-Dutch or English rules7. Anyhow, when

the legislature on its own wisdom passes laws, the residual laws cannot be considered effective

in reference to the areas covered under such laws created by the legislature. In light of the

above, the pertinent question that emerges in the instant Application is how this Court

concludes, as pleaded by the Petitioner, that the applicability of TEWA is ousted in respect

of workmen who are on probation. I am unable to find any material to support the Petitioner's

claim that the law governing the workmen on probation in Sri Lanka is the Roman-Dutch

Law or the alleged Common Law.

In other words, the Petitioner has not enlightened Court as to what test should be applied to

determine whether or not the probationers fall outside the purview of TEWA. Furthermore,

the absence of a series of express and unbroken decisions of Court which favor the proposition

that the Roman-Dutch Law governs the law relating to the probationers in this country is also

an important factor. It is a puzzle to me as to how this Court could jump into a conclusion

on the applicability of Roman-Dutch law in the instant Application based on the judgements

cited by the Petitioner which merely refers to the term 'Roman-Dutch Law' or the 'Common

Law'. A mere citation of a judgement that reflects the terminology of Roman-Dutch Law or

5 Supra FN 3,pp.101,102 6 72 N.L.R. 337. A Privy Council judgement by Lord Hodson, Viscount Dilhorne, Lord Donovan, Lord Pearson, Lord Diplock 7 Supra FN 3 p.76

Page 11 of 12

the Common Law is insufficient to resolve the questions of the case in hand without

thoroughly examining what are the ratio decidendi and obiter dictum of the respective

judgements.

In light of the above, I am not convinced with the argument of the Petitioner that the law

relating to the workmen who are on probation is still a foreign law such as Roman-Dutch

Law. I am strongly of the view that the interpretation of the provisions of TEWA especially

concerning the issue of its applicability to probationers should be done giving preference to

the evolving circumstances in today's context and also considering the indigenous Common

Law of Sri Lanka as referred to by Lord Diplock in the Kodeeswaran case. If not, there would

be grave prejudice caused to the harmony of the employer-employee relationship that exists

in Sri Lanka.

Further the Petitioner argues that there is no automatic confirmation of service of the 3rd

Respondent. Anyhow, the said argument fails, in my view, due to the phrases embodied in

the said Clause 8 of the letter of appointment marked P2 itself. The Petitioner has a right

under such Clause 8 to confirm the 3rd Respondent only if it is satisfied with the work,

performance honesty, integrity, discipline and standards of the 3rd Respondent. In that event,

it should be the bounden duty of the Petitioner to decide after a due assessment, but before

terminating the services, that the 3rd Respondent has failed in his work, performance honesty,

integrity etc.

For the reasons set forth above and on a careful consideration of the whole matter, I have

come to the conclusion that;

i) The provisions of TEWA apply to the workmen on probation including

the 3rd Respondent.

ii) The Petitioner has terminated the services of the 3rd Respondent in

violation of the provisions in section 2 of the TEWA.

The residual argument of the Petitioner is that the compensation under TEWA can only be

awarded if the respective workman has completed one year of service. The alleged basis for

such argument is that the 3rd Respondent has served only for a period less than one year and

the formula for computation of compensation prescribed under section 6D of the TEWA does

not stipulate a figure for compensation for a period less than one year of service. Having

Page 12 of 12

considered that the termination of services of the 3rd Respondent is unlawful, now to turn to

the residual argument of the Petitioner may be quite mundane. This is because, the 3rd

respondent should be entitled to some sort of redress in lieu of the said unlawful termination.

Nevertheless, I observe that the provisions of the said section 6D as well as the contents of

the said formula for payment of compensation bestowed the Commissioner a discretion to a

considerable extent when deciding the amount of compensation within the range given in the

said formula. Hence, I am not inclined to go into an in-depth examination upon the said

formula based on the facts and circumstances of this Case.

In the circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs as prayed

for in the prayer of the Petition. Therefore, I proceed to dismiss the Application of the

Petitioner.

Application is dismissed.
