Page 7 of 10

appointing a candidate to the post of Director (Administration), until the final

determination of this application.

e. Consider the delay if any to file the present case as an excusable delay

considering the reasons given by the Petitioner and the seriousness of the legal

issues involved in the impugned award of the 4th Respondent.

f. Grant Costs

g. Grant such other and further reliefs as Your Lordships Court shall seem meet.

The facts of this matter very briefly are as follows:

According to the Petitioner, the Petitioner directly joined the 1st Respondent Commission

on 06.04.2006 as the Deputy Director (Finance) and was subsequently made permanent

in that position by the letter dated 23.06.2008. The Petitioner states that when the 1st

Respondent Commission was restructured with the directions of the Department of

Management Services, the Petitioner was absorbed into the restructured salary scale of

MM-1-1 and granted the position of Deputy Director (Finance) Grade I, to which the

Petitioner is still attached to. Further, the Petitioner avers that the 3rd Respondent,

advertised the position of Director (Administration) under the salary scale HM-1-1 and

called for application with the direction of the Appointment Authority of the 1st

Respondent Commission.

The Petitioner further states that, the Petitioner applied for the said position by

application dated 21.08.2020. Further, the Petitioner states that the Petitioner had

already fulfilled all entry criteria under the internal applicants category for the position

of Director (Administration) as per the advertisement marked P5. It should be noted that,

the Petitioner was entrusted with the duties of the Director (Administration) of the 1st

Respondent in capacities of both cover-up and acting until P13 was issued.

According to P5, the internal candidates under category (b), where the Petitioner falls

into, should have the following qualifications.

Page 8 of 10

Internal Applicants Qualifications and Experience:

a. Meeting the qualifications applicable to external applicants,

or

b. Having completed five years of satisfactory service in first-grade post in the

Managerial Service Category (MM-1-1) in a relevant field at the Tertiary and

Vocational Education Commission.

According to the written submission filed on 31.07.2024, the Petitioner herself admits

that, an internal candidate, can apply for the said post either under category (a) or (b).

The Petitioner states that, since the Petitioner had acquired all the entry qualifications

cited in the advertisement marked P5 relevant to category (b) of internal candidates, the

Petitioner be eligible to be considered as a prospective candidate for the post of Director

(Administration).

However, according to the statements of objection filed on 13.12.2023, the Respondents

take the position that, the Petitioner does not fall under category (b) where an eligible

candidate should posses five years experience in first-grade post in the Managerial

Service Category (MM-1-1). Further according to the Respondents, by letter dated

14.12.2006 which is marked as R3, the Department of Management Services introduced

a salary revision for the officers of the 1st Respondent Commission who were in service as

at 31.12.2005 which also introduced a salary code for officers based on their salary scale.

According to letter dated 03.02.2010 issued by the Department of Management Services,

additional salary step for the post of Deputy Director (Finance) has not been specified as

the Petitioner joined the1st Respondent Commission after 01.01.2006. According to the

objection, the Petitioners post of Deputy Director falls under MM1-1 Grade (2).

Inadvertently, she was drawing a salary of MM1-1 Grade (1). This has come to the light

after the audit inquiry marked as R6 and R7. According to R5, the Petitioner was

inadvertently absorbed into the MM1-1 Grade (1) category. The said audit inquiry was

not challenged by the Petitioner. According to the objections, the Petitioner is not eligible

under category (b) of the advertisement marked P5 to apply for the post of Director

(Administration). Since, she does not fall under category (b) of the said advertisement, the

Petitioner has to fulfill the requirement under category (a) which requires a postgraduate

degree.

Page 9 of 10

When we peruse the documents marked P12 and P13 which are sought to be quashed by

the Petitioner, indicate the following facts;

1. With regard to the qualification for the said post, reference was made to the

Department of Management Services and response was received on 03.01.2023.

2. The letter marked P13, further revealed that the particular post of Director

(Administration) for the internal candidate requires the candidate to belong to the

salary scale of MM1-1 which she is not qualified into. Therefore, to qualify for the

said post, the Petitioner is required to possess a postgraduate degree.

When we peruse the petition, the said decision made by the Department of Management

Services is not challenged by the Petitioner contained in R13. Instead, the Petitioner

indicates that the said decision was taken by the Interview Panel. The documents marked

P12 and P13 are information regarding the decision taken by the said Department

conveyed through the Respondents. Further, P12 allows the Petitioner to appeal if the

Petitioner wants to challenge the said decisions, to date, the Petitioner has not taken any

such steps.

Generally, the Court has to consider whether the decision maker has exceeded his powers

in making the decision or not followed the procedures or biased. Therefore, there should

be a blatant error made by the decision maker executing his duties or any abuse of power

or authority in order to exercise the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court.

In the instant case, the said order made by the Department is not placed before us.

Therefore, we are unable to consider the decision of the Department to quash the said

decision.

Grounds for issuing certiorari are mentioned by M.P. Jain and S.N. Jain in Principles of

Administrative Law, 6th Enlarged Edition, Volume 2, Page 2180.

The grounds for the issue of certiorari have been succinctly stated by the Supreme Court

in Syed Yakoob v. K.S. Radhakrishnan. Prohibition and Certiorari are issuable on the

following grounds:

i. When the concerned authority is acting or has acted under a law which is invalid,

ultra vires or unconstitutional;

Page 10 of 10

ii. jurisdictional error;

iii. error of law apparent on the face of the record;

iv. findings of fact not supported by evidence;

v. failure of natural justice.

To consider the above-mentioned grounds to issue writs, the Petitioner has not placed the

said order of the Department before this Court.

Instead, the Petitioner seeks to quash the decision of the Interview Panel. We hold that

the Interview Panel has not made any decision with regard to the disqualification of the

Petitioner to the said post. The Panel has merely followed the instructions of the said

Department and conveyed the said decision to the Petitioner by the letters marked P12

and P13.

Therefore, there is no necessity to issue notice to the Respondents to quash the decision.

Application dismissed with costs.
