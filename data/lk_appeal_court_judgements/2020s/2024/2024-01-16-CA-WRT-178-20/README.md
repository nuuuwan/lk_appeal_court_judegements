DECIDED ON : 16.01.2024

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. In this Writ application, the following reliefs have been prayed for by

the petitioner.

i. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the decision made by the 2nd respondent

to reject the claim made by the petitioner in respect of the

ownership to the subject properties which is in direct

violation of the provisions of the Land Development

Ordinance;

ii. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the decision made by the 2nd respondent

awarding the life interest of the subject properties unto the

5th respondent;

iii. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of

Prohibition prohibiting the 1st to 4th respondents from

granting the life interest of the subject properties unto the 5th

respondent;

iv. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of

Mandamus directing one or more of the 1st to 4th respondents

to act strictly and promptly in terms of Rule 1 of the Third

Schedule of Section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance

to register the name of the petitioner as the lawful owner of

the subject properties;

In 1958, the petitioners father, Dandeni Mudiyanselage Peter Perera,

had been issued a permit under the Land Development Ordinance for a

highland and a paddy land. In 1982 March 16, a grant was issued in

respect of the said highland and the said paddy land to the petitioners

Page 4 of 10

father, Peter Perera. In the said grants, no successor had been

nominated.

On 17th December 1990, Peter Perera died. As the petitioners mother,

H.M. Bisomanika, was not in a position to maintain and develop the

subject properties, the petitioner stated that his younger brother,

Dandeni Mudiyanselage Karunaratne, cultivated the said paddy land

and resided in the premises situated on the highland. However, the said

D.M. Karunaratne too passed away on 19th May 2008. The petitioners

mother permitted his widow, H.A. Leelawathi, and her children to reside

in the premises situated on the highland and to cultivate the said paddy

land. The petitioners mother, H.M. Bisomanika, also passed away on

01st August 2011. The petitioner further stated that, said Leelawathi

has abandoned the subject properties since 2015.

An inquiry was held by the 2nd respondent in respect of the title to the

aforesaid subject properties and decided that Dharmadasa was the

eldest son of Peter Perera. Accordingly, it was decided further that the

title to the subject properties should be devolved on Dharmadasa. As

the said Dharmadasa passed away, the life interest of the subject

properties was granted to his wife, the 5th respondent by the letter

marked P-9.

The petitioners complaint was that the said Dharmadasa was not a

legitimate child of the petitioners father, Peter Perera and thus, the 5th

respondent is not entitled for the life interest of the subject properties.

Therefore, the petitioner claims, as the eldest surviving son of the said

Peter Perera, that he is the lawful owner of the subject properties in

terms of Rule 01 of the Third Schedule of Section 72 of the Land

Development Ordinance. The learned Presidents Counsel for the

petitioner contended that irrationally and unreasonably, the life interest

of the subject properties was granted to the 5th respondent on the

decision of the 2nd respondent.

Page 5 of 10

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 1st to 4th

respondents contended that the marriage certificate of Dharmadasa

(marked R-6) and birth certificates of the sons of Dharmadasa (marked

R-7 and R-7A) demonstrate that Peter Perera is the father of

Dharmadasa. Anyhow, the learned Deputy Solicitor General requested

the Court to go through the relevant documents of the case and

determine the matter.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner does not dispute the

fact that Bisomanika was the mother of Dharmadasa. His contention

was that Peter Perera was not his father and therefore, the ownership

of the subject properties does not devolve on Dharmadasa.

P-5 is the birth certificate of the petitioner. Initially, only the mother's

name, Bisomanika, was mentioned in his birth certificate, and the

father's name was not mentioned. P-7 is the birth certificate of said

Dharmadasa. In the said birth certificate also, the mothers name

appears as Bisomanika, but the fathers name is not mentioned.

After obtaining the order dated 28.12.1971 by filing the case bearing

No. B 1273 in the District Court of Anuradhapura, the petitioners birth

certificate was amended by inserting Peter Pereras name as the father

of the petitioner. In the birth certificate of Dharmadasa, the name of his

father has never been inserted.

Submitting the case of Ubeyratne v. Karunawathi and others

(1999) 3 Sri L.R. 16, the learned Presidents Counsel contended that the

names of the parents mentioned in the birth certificate of the child are

conclusive proof regarding the legitimacy of the child. It is stated in the

aforesaid judgment that as the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th plaintiff-respondents

were born during the continuance of a valid marriage between the

parents mentioned in their respective birth certificates, that fact is to be

deemed as conclusive proof that they are the legitimate children of their

putative father." I agree with the contention of the learned Presidents

Page 6 of 10

Counsel that it is evident from the amendment to the birth certificate

of the petitioner that Peter Perera was the father of the petitioner.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner contended further

that for the purpose of amending the petitioners birth certificate by

inserting the fathers name, the father himself had to make the

application according to the proviso to Section 28 of the Births and

Deaths Registration Act No. 17 of 1951 as amended by the Act No. 22

of 1955. I regret that I am unable to agree with that contention because

the proviso to Section 28(1) of the Act states that an application for any

alteration or insertion of the name of the person whose birth was

registered could only be made by the person desiring his name to be so

altered or inserted. The proviso does not state that the father himself

must make the application to insert his name as the father in the birth

certificate of his child. For clarity, relevant portions from Section 28(1)

of the Births and Deaths Registration Act prevailed at that time are

reproduced below. (Subsequently, Section 28 was amended)

28(1) A person whose birth has been registered (whether under this Act

or under any past enactment), or his parent or guardian, or a

person aggrieved by any particulars in the entry relating to that

birth may make a written application to the District Court of the

District in which the birth occurred for an order directing -

(a) the alteration or insertion of the name of the person whose

birth was registered, if, but only if, such persons age at the

date of the application is not less than twenty-one years; or

(b) the alteration of all or any of the particulars in the register

relating to the name, race, rank, or profession of the father of

such person or for the omission of such particulars or for the

insertion of fresh particulars, in any case where the original

particulars had been falsely or improperly entered;

(c) the insertion of the name of the father of such person, in any

case where such name was omitted at the time of the original

entry; or

Page 7 of 10

(d)

(e)

(f)

Provided, however, that an application for any alteration or insertion

referred to in paragraph (a) of this subsection may be made to the

District Court only by the person desiring his name to be so altered or

inserted. (Emphasis added)

However, after Bisomanika and Peter Perera got married, the petitioner

went before the District Court of Anuradhapura, obtained an order and

inserted Peter Pereras name as his father in his birth certificate. Hence,

undoubtedly, the petitioner is a legitimate son of Peter Perera.

However, Dharmadasa has not taken steps to insert Peter Pereras

name as the father of Dharmadasa in his birth certificate. The petitioner

made this application on the basis that Dharmadasas mother is

Bisomanika, but his father is not Peter Perera and thus Dharmadasa is

not entitled for the subject properties.

In the birth certificates of the petitioner as well as the said Dharmadasa,

the fathers name was not mentioned initially. Only the name of the

mother Bisomanika was mentioned in both birth certificates. When

Peter Pereras name was inserted in the birth certificate of the

petitioner, it is mentioned that the parents got married later. Peter

Pereras name was inserted in the birth certificate of the petitioner in

1971. It conforms that Peter Perera and Bisomanika were married by

1971. Peter Perera died in 1990. Within this period, if Peter Perera was

his father, Dharmadasa could have taken steps to insert Peter Pereras

name as his father in his birth certificate as well. But Dharmadasa has

never taken steps to insert Peter Pereras name as his father in his birth

certificate. The contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner was

that it is evident from not inserting the name of Peter Perera as the

Page 8 of 10

father in the birth certificate of Dharmadasa that Peter Perera was not

the father of Dharmadasa.

Bisomanika and Peter Perera were not married at the time that the

petitioner was born. After they got married, the petitioner took steps to

insert Peter Pereras name as his father in his birth certificate.

Dharmadasa, was older than the petitioner. If Dharmadasa was also

Peter Perera's son, he could have taken steps to insert Peter Perera's

name in his birth certificate after the marriage of Peter Perera and

Bisomanika. But Dharmadasa has never taken such steps.

As it was held in the aforesaid judgment of Ubeyratne V. Karunawathi

and Others, the parents names mentioned in the birth certificate of the

child are conclusive proof regarding the legitimacy of the child. The

birth certificate is the best evidence to demonstrate that the child was

born to the parents whose names appear on the birth certificate as the

father and mother. When Dharmadasa had every opportunity to

insert Peter Perera's name as his father in his birth certificate but he

did not, it naturally raises the doubt whether Peter Perera was not the

Dharmadasa's father. In any case, the aforesaid circumstances clearly

demonstrate that Dharmadasa does not have the best evidence to

establish paternity.

What was pointed out by the learned Deputy Solicitor General

appearing for the 1st to 4A respondents was that in the marriage

certificate of Dharmadasa, Peter Pereras name is mentioned as

Dharmadasas father. In addition, R-7 and R-7A are the birth

certificates of Dharmadasas children. The elder child was born in 1971,

and the younger child was born in 1976. In both birth certificates of the

children of Dharmadasa, the learned DSG pointed out that their

grandfather's name is mentioned as Peter Perera. Drawing the attention

of the Court to the aforementioned documents, the learned DSG

Page 9 of 10

requested to determine the matter considering all the documents

presented to the Court.

In a marriage registration, the parties who entered into the marriage

provide the required information for the registration. In the marriage

certificate of Dharmadasa (R-6) he may have informed the Registrar that

his fathers name is Peter Perera. The Registrar of Marriages would not

go in to verify the accuracy of that information. If Dharmadasa had

mentioned some other name as his fathers name, that name would be

mentioned as his fathers name in his marriage certificate. Therefore,

Dharmadasas marriage certificate does not establish that he is a

legitimate child of Peter Perera. It is obvious that Peter Pereras name

would be mentioned as the grandfathers name in the birth certificates

of Dharmadasas children when Peter Pereras name is entered in the

marriage certificate of Dharmadasa as his father. Therefore, the birth

certificates of Dharmadasas children also do not establish that Peter

Perera is the father of Dharmadasa. In the circumstances, there is no

proof that Dharmadasa is the elder son of Peter Perera.

The Court drew the attention of the learned Counsel for both parties to

Section 3 of the Legitimacy Act No. 3 of 1970 wherein it is stated that

A valid marriage to which this Act applies shall be deemed at all times,

whether before or on or after the date of the commencement of this Act,

to have rendered, and to render, legitimate any child procreated by the

parties prior to such marriage, whether or not such child was so

procreated in adultery.

The reply of the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the petitioner

was that the said section would not apply to this case because

Dharmadasa has not been procreated by both parties, the father and

the mother. He contended that the above section would apply when the

child is procreated by both parties prior to the marriage. In the case at

hand, he contended that the mother Bisomanika got married to Peter

Page 10 of 10

Perera but not to the father of Dharmadasa. Although, it is not proved

that Dharmadasas father is someone else, other than Peter Perera, in

the absence of proof that Peter Perera was the father of Dharmadasa,

Section 3 of the Legitimacy Act cannot be applied.

The 2nd respondent has made the decision contained in P-9 in terms of

Rule 1 of the Third Schedule of Section 72 of the Land Development

Ordinance on the basis that Dharmadasa was the elder son of Peter

Perera. However, for the reasons stated above, there is no sufficient

material to come to the conclusion that Peter Perera was the father of

Dharmadasa. Accordingly, I hold that the decision contained in P-9

made by the 2nd respondent is erroneous.

In view of the aforesaid facts and circumstances, only the petitioner has

been proved as the surviving son of Peter Perera. Hence, the petitioner

should be the lawful owner of the subject properties in terms of Rule 1

of the Third Schedule of Section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance.

Accordingly, Writs of Certiorari are issued as prayed for in the prayers

(c) and (d) of the petition. A Writ of Prohibition is issued as prayed for

in the prayer (e) of the petition. A Writ of Mandamus is issued as prayed

for in the prayer (f) of the petition.

The application is allowed. No costs.
