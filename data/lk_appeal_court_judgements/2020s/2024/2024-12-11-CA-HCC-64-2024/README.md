JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of

Ratnapura. The indictment against the accused-appellant

reads as follows;

(a) That on or about 21.03.2011, at Kahawatta, in the District

of Ratnapura within the jurisdiction of this Court you did

commit murder by causing the death of Krishnapille

the matter has proceeded to trial without a jury.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge

has found the accused-appellant guilty to the charge, convicted

and sentenced him to death.

3

4. The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) aggrieved by the judgement and the sentencing

order has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

5. Grounds of appeal on behalf of the accused-appellant:

(a) The Learned High Court Judge erred in law when analysing

the law relating to a dying declaration of the deceased

person.

(b) The Learned High Court Judge has misdirected herself in

evaluating the evidence led in the case with regard to the

incident.

(c) The Learned High Court Judge has not considered the fact

that there is a reasonable doubt connected to the dying

declaration.

(d) The Learned High Court Judge has not properly evaluated

the medical evidence in relation to the dying declaration.

Facts in Brief:

6. The deceased Krishnapille Chandrakumari, has been a widow

at the relevant period of time. Her husband has passed away

about thirteen years ago. She is a mother of two. The elder

daughter has gone overseas for employment. The younger

daughter (PW4) was residing with an aunt of hers in the

Watapotha area at the relevant period of time. The deceased

4

accordingly resided alone in a line room situated on the

Gabbela division of the Andane Estate in Kahawatta.

7. PW1 and PW3 are husband and wife. They lived in the

neighbouring line room to that of the deceased. On the day of

the incident, PW1, PW3, their child and a neighbour by the

name of Logachandran were inside the line room they were

residing in, when they heard screams from the direction of the

line room occupied by the deceased. Such screams were heard

at about 20.00 hrs on 21.03.2011. When PW1 and PW3

rushed in to the line room occupied by the deceased, they have

seen the deceased in flames. The dress of the deceased had

caught fire. The flames had spread to the upper body area of

the deceased. PW1 and PW3 have also seen the appellant in

the kitchen area where the deceased was in flames. The

appellant had been leaning on to a door frame therein when

PW1 and PW3 saw him first. The appellant has been the only

other person present at that scene of the incident, in addition

to PW1, PW3 and the deceased at that moment of time.

8. Soon after PW1 and PW3 arrived at the scene, the appellant

had himself tried to extinguish the fire using the water collected

in a pot for consumption purposes. The appellant has also

subsequently, tried to remove the clothes of the deceased which

were burning and injured a hand of his in the process. Further,

has pleaded that he be taken to the hospital for treatment.

9. PW1, PW3 and the others who had gathered at the scene

subsequently have called for the estate ambulance to transport

5

the injured to the hospital. The deceased and the appellant

have been admitted to the Kahawatta Base Hospital initially

and then transferred to the Ratnapura Teaching Hospital for

further treatment. The deceased while receiving treatment has

passed away on 29.03.2011. PW8, Dr. I. A. Rathnayake, has

conducted the post-mortem of the deceased on 31.03.2011

and opined that the death was due to extensive burns. The

post-mortem report has been marked as .3.

10. When the deceased was receiving treatment at the Ratnapura

Teaching Hospital, PW6 (PS48378 Amarasekara

Dissanayake) being an officer assigned to the team to

investigate the complaint regarding the incident which caused

injuries to the deceased and the appellant, has proceeded to

record a statement of the deceased on 26.03.2024. Prior to

recording the statement PW6 has obtained the permission of the

matron in charge of the particular ward and also satisfied

himself of the fact that the deceased was in a fit and proper state

at that time to make a statement. Since the statement has been

recorded in the Sinhala language, PW6 has further satisfied

himself of the competence of the deceased to make a statement

in the Sinhala language.

11. The statement made by the deceased to PW6 on 26.11.2011 is

as follows,

6

12. The statement made by the deceased to PW6 being one in the

nature as reproduced above, such statement by the said

Krishanapille Chandra Kumari (since deceased) refers to

circumstances of the transaction which resulted in her death.

7

13. Section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance No.14 of 1895

provides,

Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead, or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which, under the circumstances of the case, appears to the court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases: -

(1) When the statement is made by a person as

to the cause of his death, or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in cases in which the cause of that persons death comes into question. Such statements are relevant whether the person who made them was or not, at the time when they were made, under expectation of death, and whatever may be the nature of the proceedings in which the cause of his death comes into question

14. Furthermore, Illustration (a) to Section 32 of the

Evidence Ordinance provides,

The question is, whether A was murdered by B, or whether A died of injuries received in a transaction in the course of which she was ravished. The question is, whether she was ravished by B; or

The question is, whether A was killed by B under such circumstances that a suit would lie against B by As widow.

8

Statements made by A as to the cause of his or her death, referring respectively to the murder, the rape, and the actionable wrong under consideration, are relevant facts.

15. In those circumstances, the Learned High Court Judge

applying the provisions in Section 32(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance No. 15 of 1895 has permitted the statement referred

to above, to be read in evidence on the basis that it referred to

circumstances of the transaction which resulted in the death of

the deceased, therefore a dying declaration. The relevant

statement has been marked as . 2.

16. The Learned Counsel for the appellant has contended that the

deceased was unable to make a statement to PW6 due to the

critical condition she was in as a result of the burn injuries

suffered by her. The Counsel has further contended that the

deceased was unable to speak with the passage of time, after

sustaining the burn injuries and sought to substantiate her

contention by drawing the attention to portions of evidence of

PW4 (the daughter of the deceased) and the doctor who

conducted the post-mortem examination on the deceased, Dr. I.

A. Rathnayake (PW8).

9

17. Dr. I. A. Rathnayake has stated as follows;

10

18. PW4 (the daughter of the deceased), has stated as follows;

11

19. Dr. Rathnayake in her evidence has expressed only an opinion.

Dr. Rathnayake does not specifically state that the injuries

suffered by the deceased have resulted in the deceased not being

able to speak. Further, Dr. Rathnayake has not been on call in

the ward where the deceased was receiving treatment. Therefore,

she has not been in a position to monitor the condition of the

deceased continuously until her death. Further, the evidence of

Dr. Rathnayake regarding the condition of the deceased is not

based on notes prepared by her upon observing the deceased as

a patient.

12

20. The statement of the deceased marked as . 2 has been

recorded by PW6 on 26.03.2011. Prior to recording the

statement marked . 2. PW6 has proceeded to record a

statement of PW4 the daughter of the deceased. The statement

of PW4 has been recorded by PW6 on 25.03.2011. The

statement has been recorded at a location close to the place

where the fire happened. In those circumstances, it is

questionable as to whether PW4 was always by the bedside of

the deceased in the hospital and was able to monitor the

deceased continuously as stated by PW4 in her evidence.

Further, PW4 has mentioned nothing about the deceased being

not able to speak in her statement to PW6. Such omission has

prompted PW6 to proceed to the hospital and record a statement

of the deceased subsequently on 26.03.2011.

21. It is the evidence of PW6 that the deceased was stable and was

able to converse on the day PW6 recorded her statement in the

hospital. PW6 has obtained permission from the matron in

charge of the ward, the deceased was in, prior to recording the

deceased statement. The matron has given permission to PW6

to do so. Generally, such permission would not have been

granted if the deceased was not in a fit state to converse.

Further, when PW6 was cross-examined, it has not been

suggested to the witness that the deceased was not in a fit state

on the particular date to make a statement to PW6. Also, the

credibility of PW6 has not been impeached by the appellant at

the trial.

13

22. Accordingly, I reject the contention of the appellant that the

deceased did not make the statement marked . 2.

23. The post-mortem report prepared by PW8 has been produced

as evidence and marked as . 3. Dr. Rathnayake has

expressed an opinion that the death of the deceased has

occurred due to the injuries caused by extensive burns to the

body of the deceased and concluded that the bodily injuries

inflicted by the burns have been sufficient in the ordinary course

of nature to cause the death of the deceased.

24. It has been established by the prosecution that the appellant

was the only person present with the deceased at the particular

location when the latter was in flames. The appellant had not

attempted to extinguish the fire until PW1 and PW3 arrived at

the scene of the incident. Further, it can be observed that the

appellant has not attempted to extinguish the fire to the best of

his ability. The appellant has in a lethargic manner splashed

some water onto the deceaseds body, which has been brought

for drinking purposes and was collected in a pot.

25. The appellant has also not made a proper attempt to collect

sufficient water from an external source and use it to extinguish

the fire. Further, the appellant has not cried out for help at the

first given opportunity nor has he made an attempt to seek

medical intervention on behalf of the deceased without delay.

When the statement marked . 2 was read in evidence, the

appellant has not disputed the contents in it at the first

14

instance. In those circumstances the prosecution has

established highly incriminating evidence and such

circumstances which caused the appellant to appear guilty of

the crime, in other words, a prima facie case has been made out

by the prosecution. Therefore, the appellant is required in law to

offer an explanation.

In Sumanasena vs. Attorney General [1999] 3 SLR page 137

at page 142, Jayasuriya, J, has stated,

When the prosecution establishes a strong and

incriminating cogent evidence against the accused, the

accused in those circumstances was required in law to

offer an explanation of the highly incriminating

circumstances established against him.

His Lordship has also stated,

the learned trial Judge was entitled to draw certain

inferences which he deemed proper from the failure of the

accused to give evidence in explanation of such

circumstances.

26. The appellant in making a statement from the dock has stated

that on this particular day he visited the deceased to hand over

to her a mobile phone which was collected after repairs and a

ring of the deceased which was redeemed from a pawning centre

by the appellant. When the appellant visited the residence of the

deceased, the deceased has supposedly complained that PW4,

had expressed her displeasure regarding the deceaseds

15

behavior towards the appellant. The deceased had also stated

that either of them will have to take a decision due to the

displeasure expressed by her daughter. The appellant thereafter

has left the mobile phone and the ring on a table in the line room

occupied by the deceased and just stepped out of the particular

line room when he heard a noise. When the appellant stepped

into the line room occupied by the deceased again, to ascertain

what the noise was, he has seen the deceased standing near the

cooker in flames. The appellant has further stated that was all

that happened on that day.

27. The appellant in making a further statement in answer to an

allocutus has contradicted himself in stating that he saw the

deceased set herself on fire and did so by holding her dress to the

flame in the cooker.

28. In Periyambalam et al., vs. The Queen 74 NLR page 515 at

page 519, Siva Supramanian, J, has stated,

Whatever may be the history of the origin of the allocutus

at criminal trials, we are satisfied in this case that the

statement of the 1st appellant was an unequivocal and

unqualified admission to the Court that the injuries on the

deceased which resulted in his death were inflicted by

him. It was submitted by learned counsel for the

appellants that the statement made by the 1st appellant

is not part of the evidence in the case and this Court will

not therefore be justified in acting upon it. We are unable

to agree.

16

In the case of Martin Appu v. The King1 (52 N.L.R.119)

it was held that the Court of Criminal Appeal may take

into consideration statements made by the appellant in

his notice of appeal although such statements refer to

matters outside the evidence given at the trial.

29. In those circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the

statement made in answer to an allocutus by the appellant is

part of evidence in the case and the Appellate Court is justified

in acting upon such evidence.

Though the appellant in making statements from the dock and

in answer to the allocutus has attempted to communicate to

Court that the deceased set fire to herself, such an explanation

has not been suggested to the prosecution witnesses in cross-

examination. Further, he has only offered such an explanation

at the tail end of the trial. Due to the delay and inconsistency of

such explanation offered by the appellant it could be inferred

that such explanation has emanated from the appellant due to

an after-thought of his. Therefore, it is my view that, good

reasons exist to disregard the explanation of the appellant. In

those circumstances, it is also my view that the appellant has

failed to offer an explanation to the incriminating evidence

established against him. The highly incriminating evidence

established against the appellant therefore remain unexplained.

30. In King vs. Thajudeen 6 NLR page 16 at page 19, Bonser CJ

has stated,

But it was urged that they did not intend to break the

mans rib and therefore they could not be convicted of

17

grievous hurt. No doubt they had not in their mind at the

time they struck him their baton and with their fists any

definite idea that they were going to break his ribs or any

particular rib; but when people cause injuries to a man,

their intent must be judged by the result of their action.

They must be deemed in law to have intended what they

did.

Therefore, the Court can deem that the appellant intended to

inflict such bodily injury to the deceased which was sufficient in

the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased.

31. Due to the aforesaid reasons, we are not inclined to interfere

with the impugned judgment and dismiss the appeal.

The Appeal is dismissed. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High Court of Ratnapura for compliance.
