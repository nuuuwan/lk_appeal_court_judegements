Argued on : 04-10-2023

Decided on : 06-02-2024

Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the complainant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred

to as the appellant) on being aggrieved by the order dated 21-04-2021 of the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo where the revision application filed by the

appellant was dismissed.

Page 6 of 13

The appellant has filed the said revision application before the High Court of

Colombo seeking to challenge the order made by the learned Chief Magistrate of

Colombo on 29-10-2019 in the Chief Magistrates Court of Colombo Case

Number 20086/01/19.

The appellant has instituted this action before the Chief Magistrates Court of

Colombo as a private plaint filed in terms of section 136(1)(a) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, read with section 25(1)(b) of the Debt

Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of 1990 as amended by Debt Recovery

(Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 09 of 1994.

When this matter was supported for summons by the learned Counsel who

represented the appellant before the Chief Magistrates Court of Colombo on 15-

10-2019, the learned Chief Magistrate has recorded that a suitable order will be

made upon scrutinizing the case record.

Accordingly, the learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo has pronounced the order

dated 29-10-2019 refusing to issue summons as sought, and thereby dismissing

the private plaint filed by the appellant.

It is quite apparent from the order of the learned Chief Magistrate that she was

well aware of the requirements that a Judge should look before issuing summons

based on a private plaint filed in terms of section 136(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act. It appears that the learned Chief Magistrate has considered the

reported case of Malani Gunaratne, Additional District Judge Galle Vs.

Abeysinghe and Another (1994) 3 SLR 196 as guidance for her considerations,

and has come to a correct finding that the requirement should be to look whether

there are sufficient reasons to issue summons and not to go into deep

consideration of the evidence that can be adduced in proving the charges

mentioned in a private plaint.

Page 7 of 13

The action instituted by the appellant has been on the basis that the two accused

mentioned in the draft plaint and the charge sheet, issued two cheques as

mentioned in the plaint for goods sold to them by the appellant, which were

dishonoured by the relevant bank when presented for payment. It was on that

basis the appellant has filed this private plaint seeking to punish the wrongdoers

in terms of section 25(1)(b) of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act.

It is apparent from the order of the learned Chief Magistrate that the summons

has been refused, on two grounds. It has been determined that since the cheques

had been dishonoured by the bank due to the fact that the relevant account has

been closed, it was necessary for the appellant to establish the date as to when

the relevant account had been closed, and the Court cannot determine such a

fact until a report from the relevant bank is called in order to determine whether

the accused had committed an offence. Since no such report has been called and

produced with the private plaint, it has been determined that there exists no

basis for the Court to issue summons as requested.

The other factor considered by the learned Chief Magistrate to refuse summons

had been the appellants apparent failure to make a police complaint in that

regard.

Having considered the above two factors, the learned Chief Magistrate has

refused summons to the accused.

When the above order was challenged by way of a revision application before the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo, the learned

High Court Judge who considered the application has dismissed it on the basis

that the order of the learned Chief Magistrate was justified. However, it appears

that the learned High Court Judge has wrongly considered the section under

which the appellant sought to institute an action under the Debt Recovery

(Special Provisions) Act.

Page 8 of 13

Although the learned High Court Judge has considered the relevant section

under which the appellant has filed an action as section 25(1)(a) of the Act, in

fact, the action filed by the appellant by way of a private plaint has been in terms

of section 25(1)(b) of the Act.

In his submissions before this Court, the learned Counsel for the appellant

submitted that the reasons given by the learned High Court Judge to justify the

order of the learned Chief Magistrate and the reasons given by the learned Chief

Magistrate to refuse to issue summons are not according to the law. It was his

view that there was no necessity for the appellant to prove the charge before the

summons being issued, but only to establish a sufficient basis before the Court

to convince the Court in that regard.

He was of the view that the learned Chief Magistrate has gone beyond that

requirement and had looked at matters that should have been considered after

hearing evidence in the matter. He was also of the view that making a prior

complaint to the police in a matter of this nature is not an essential prerequisite

in filing a private plaint.

He moved for the setting aside of the two orders sought to be challenged, and for

an order to issue summons to the relevant accused in the case.

This is an action filed by the appellant as a private plaint in terms of section

136(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

The relevant section 136(1)(a) reads as follows.

136. (1) Proceedings in a Magistrate's Court shall be instituted in one

of the following ways: -

(a) on a complaint being made orally or in writing to a Magistrate

of such Court that an offence has been committed which such

Court has jurisdiction either to inquire into or try.

Page 9 of 13

The procedure as to the issue of summons has been defined in section 139 of

the Code. It has been stated that before issuing summons in terms of 136(1)(a),

the Magistrate may examine on oath the complainant or some material witness

or witnesses and satisfy that there exist reasonable grounds to issue summons.

In the matter under appeal, when this private plaint was presented to the Court,

the appellant who was the complainant, has tendered an affidavit as well,

informing the facts and the circumstances which led to the issuing of the

cheques and dishonouring of the same by the bank.

It appears that when this matter was supported for summons, the learned Chief

Magistrate has not required the appellant to lead evidence but has decided to

scrutinize the case record in order to make an order, most probably since the

appellant has substantiated his case by way of an affidavit. The learned Chief

Magistrate has determined that, to convict a person on the basis of issuing a

cheque while the account was closed, it becomes necessary for the Court to know

the date from which the said account has been closed. It has been determined

that if the account was functioning on the day the cheque was issued and the

account has been closed subsequently to it, a conviction cannot be entered and

therefore, since the appellant has failed to submit a report from the bank along

with the plaint, there exists no basis to justify issuing of summons.

I am in no position to agree with the above reasoning of the learned Chief

Magistrate.

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the relevant section 25 of the Debt

Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of 1990 as amended by Debt Recovery

(Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 09 of 1994.

25. (1) Any person who,

(a) knowingly draws a cheque which is dishonored by a bank for

want of funds ; or

Page 10 of 13

(b) gives an order to a banker to pay a sum of money, which

payment is not made by reason of there being no obligation on

such banker to make payment or the order given being

subsequently countermanded with a dishonest intention,

or; and

(c) gives an authority to an institution to pay a sum of money

to itself, in payment of a debt or loan or any part thereof owed

to such institution, from, and out of an account maintained or

funds deposited, by such person with such institution and such

institution is unable to make such payment to itself by reason

of such person not placing adequate funds in such account or

by reason of the funds deposited having been withdrawn by

reason of such person countermanding the authority given or

by reason of any one or more of such reasons ; or

(d) having accepted an inland bill refuses payment dishonestly;

shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall on

conviction by a Magistrate alter summary trial be liable to

punishment with imprisonment of either description for a term

which may extend to one year or with fine of ten thousand

rupees or ten per centum of the full value of the cheque, order,

authority or inland bill in respect of which the offence is

committed, whichever is higher, or with both such fine and

imprisonment.

It is clear that the necessary ingredient to prove a charge in terms of section 25

(1)(b) is to prove that the drawer of the cheque in relation to this case made an

order to the banker to pay a sum of money, which payment is not made by reason

of there being no obligation on the such banker to make payment.

Page 11 of 13

It is apparent from the copy of the Magistrates Court case record tendered along

with this appeal, that the appellant has tendered along with the plaint, the draft

charge sheet and the earlier mentioned affidavit, a list of witnesses and a list of

documents, which the appellant would be relying on to prove the charges. He

has also tendered to the Court the two cheque return notifications relating to the

two cheques issued by the accused.

In the said notifications, the relevant bank has informed the reasons for not

honouring the cheques as the relevant account had been closed at the time the

cheques were presented. This goes on to show that there had been no obligation

to the banker to honour the cheques due to the said fact.

I am of the view that this has provided enough information to the learned Chief

Magistrate to satisfy herself as to the necessary consideration that should be

looked into in issuing summons to an accused in a case filed as a private plaint.

Since the appellant has tendered a list of witnesses that he intends to call at the

trial, which includes an official from the relevant bank to prove the details as to

the account through which the cheques have been issued, I am of the view that

the appellant has provided sufficient information as to the way he intends to

prove the charges against the accused.

The other reason the learned Chief Magistrate has decided to refuse notice had

been on the basis that the appellant has failed to make a complaint to a Peace

Officer, in other words, to police, to enable such Peace Officer to conduct a

criminal investigation in this regard. I am in no position to agree with the said

determination of the learned Chief Magistrate either.

There is no requirement in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act that when a

private plaint is instituted, in terms of section 136(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, such a plaint should be after making a complaint with regard to

the same to a Peace Officer, although such a complaint may have an added

advantage under certain circumstances.

Page 12 of 13

The Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act is a statute enacted by the legislature

in its wisdom to facilitate financial transactions which are essentially civil

matters in nature. However, it is quite apparent that in order to facilitate smooth

functioning of the purposes of the Act, the legislature by its wisdom has

introduced sections where wrongdoers can be punished in criminal proceedings.

Section 25 is one such section. It is my considered view that to initiate actions

under section 25 and similar sections in other similar statutes, making a prior

complaint to a Peace Officer is not a requirement that should be considered

essential in instituting actions under such provisions.

There are several other statutes, which are essentially statutes that had been

provided for transactions civil in nature, but has provisions where criminal

actions can be instituted. For example, section 41 of the Finance Leasing Act No.

56 of 2000, sections 20 (2), 64 and 65 of the Finance Business Act No. 42 of

2011, section 38 of the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988, sections 42, 177

and 382 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007.

For the reasons considered as above, I am of the view that the learned Chief

Magistrate of Colombo was misdirected when it was decided to refuse issuing of

summons to the accused mentioned in the private plaint.

I am of the view that there were sufficient reasons provided by the appellant to

justify issuing of summons. I find that the learned High Court Judge was

misdirected when the revision application filed by the appellant was dismissed.

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 21-04-2021 by the learned High Court

Judge of Colombo, and the order dated 29-10-2019 by the learned Chief

Magistrate of Colombo, as both the orders cannot be allowed to stand.

Page 13 of 13

I direct that the summons shall be issued to the accused mentioned in the plaint,

proceed therefrom, and conclude this matter.

The appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the

learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo for necessary compliance and to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record for information.
