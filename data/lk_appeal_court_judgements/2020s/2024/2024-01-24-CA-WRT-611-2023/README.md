MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

I heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this Application. I

heard the learned State Counsel for the Respondents as well.

The 1st Respondent has instituted proceedings against the Petitioner in the

Magistrates Court of Kegalle in case bearing No. 17324/D/23 in terms of the

provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act, No. 7 of 1979. The

Petitioner is seeking a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st

Respondent, Divisional Secretary of Kegalle, that the Petitioner is in

unauthorized occupation of the land which is described in the quit notice marked

as P19a. The Petitioner is also seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

of the 1st Respondent to institute proceedings against the Petitioner in the

Magistrates Court of Kegalle in case bearing No. 17324/D/23.

The only ground upon which the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is challenging

the quit notice issued under the provisions of the said Act is that the competent

authority, the 1st Respondent, has not identified the subject matter with metes

and bounds.

According to the Petition, the Petitioner is in possession of lot 4 in plan bearing

No. 839 marked as P1, that is owned by the Land Reform Commission. Even

though there is a contract between the Petitioner and the Land Reforms

Commission to transfer the said lot to the Petitioner, so far the transfer has not

been effected. As per the quit notice marked P19a, according to the Surveyor

General's Plan No. 3831, the subject matter is bounded as follows.

1. North- portion of lot 1 in plan No. 3831

2. East- lot 4 and roadway as per Plan No. 839

3. South- road

4. West- lot 4 in Plan No. 839

In this respect, it is abundantly clear that the subject matter which is described

in the quit notice, upon which the said Magistrates Court proceedings are

instituted, is properly identified with metes and bounds without any ambiguity.

Moreover, it is pertinent to be noted that the land claimed by the Petitioner,

namely lot 4 in plan 839 is not the subject matter of the said Magistrates Court

proceedings. The said lot 4 in plan No. 839 where the Petitioner claims that he

is in possession is shown as the Eastern and Western boundary of the corpus of

the Magistrates Court case. In this scenario, I decline to accept the contention

of the learned Counsel for the Petitioner stating that the subject matter is not

properly identified.

According to the documents tendered, as it is ex facie established that the

subject matter is properly identified with metes and bounds and the land claimed

by the Petitioner is not within the subject matter, it appears to this Court that

necessity does not arise to invoke the Writ Jurisdiction of this Court.

Furthermore, as per the oral submissions of the State Counsel for the

Respondents, this Court has taken cognizance of the fact that the entire land

including lot 4 in plan No. 839 has been acquired by the State from the Land

Reforms Commission under and in terms of the provisions of the Land

Acquisition Act.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the instant Application is devoid of merits

and accordingly, notices are refused and the application is dismissed without

costs.

Application dismissed. No costs.
