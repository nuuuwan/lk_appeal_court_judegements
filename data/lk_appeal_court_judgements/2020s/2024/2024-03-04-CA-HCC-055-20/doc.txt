the Accused-Appellant.

General.

ARGUED ON : 05.02.2024

DECIDED ON : 04.03.2024

WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. The 2nd accused-appellant together with another two accused were

indicted in the High Court of Gampaha in terms of Section 296, 300,

317, and 314 of the Penal Code. The 1st accused died before the

commencement of the trial. After trial, the 3rd accused was acquitted

from the charges against him. The 2nd accused-appellant was convicted

by the judgment dated 29.07.2020 for committing the murder of one

Wasantha Ranjith Abeysinghe, an offence punishable under Section

296 of the Penal Code. This appeal has been preferred against the said

conviction.

Prior to the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for

the 2nd accused-appellant and the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General (SDSG) for the respondent filed written submissions. At the

hearing, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant and the

learned SDSG made oral submissions.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant advanced his

arguments on the following grounds of appeal:

i. The learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate the evidence

regarding the identification of the 2nd accused-appellant.

Page 3 of 12

ii. The learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate the evidence

regarding the injuries sustained by the 2nd accused-appellant.

iii. The learned High Court Judge expected proof of the defence

case.

iv. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the dock

statement properly.

This incident had taken place on 23.06.2006. The deceased 1st accused

and the 2nd accused-appellant are twins. The eyewitnesses who gave

evidence regarding the incident are PW-1, PW-3, and PW-4. PW-1 is the

wife of the deceased. PW-3 is a neighbour of the deceased. PW-4 is the

wife of the elder brother of the deceased.

As the aforesaid four grounds of appeal are interconnected, I expect to

deal with all four grounds together. PW-1, the wife of the deceased

stated in her evidence how the incident commenced. She stated that

the appellant and his twin brother came together and assaulted her

husband (the deceased) with an iron bar. She further stated that one of

the twins assaulted her mother-in-law as well. When PW-1 came

forward to settle the dispute she had also been hit with the iron bar and

was injured. PW-1 had seen the incident up to a certain point and then,

she rushed to the police station to make a complaint.

PW-4 has also seen the incident. She stated that the appellant and his

brother came with an iron bar and a dagger, grabbed the deceased, and

assaulted him. She could not distinctly identify who possessed the iron

bar and who possessed the dagger, as they were twins. PW-1 has also

stated that one of the twin brothers attacked with the iron bar but she

could not identify whether it was the 1st accused or the appellant.

The learned Presidents Counsel stated at the beginning of his

arguments that the appellant does not deny his presence at the scene.

As the deceased 1st accused and the appellant are twins, the learned

Page 4 of 12

Presidents Counsel mainly challenged the findings of the learned High

Court Judge regarding the identification of the appellant. The

contention of the learned Presidents Counsel was that it has not been

established whether the first accused or the appellant caused the fatal

injury to the deceased. The contention of the learned SDSG was that

the first accused and the appellant were acting in furtherance of their

common intention to kill the deceased and thus, even if the injuries that

resulted in the death of the deceased were caused by the first accused,

the appellant would be liable under Section 32 of the Penal Code for

committing the offence of murder.

At this stage, it is pertinent to consider the doctrine of common

intention. Following judicial authorities clearly demonstrate, on what

occasions the doctrine of common intention could be applied. In Queen

V. Vincent Fernando and two others 65 NLR 265, it was held that

to be liable under Section 32, a mental sharing of the common

intention is not sufficient, the sharing must be evidenced by a criminal

act. In Richard V. State 76 NLR 534 at 546, it was held that in the

absence of explanation [from Premadasa], the jury were entitled to draw

the reasonable inference from all the circumstances that his presence

at the scene was a participating presence as distinct from a mere

presence which would have entitled him to an acquittal. [Emphasis

added] It is settled law that to convict a person for an offence under

common intention, his presence at the scene must be a participatory

presence, and mere presence of the accused at the scene is not

sufficient.

It was also held in Sarath Kumara V. Attorney General C.A. No.

207/2008, decided on 04.04.2014 that once a participatory

presence in furtherance of a common intention is established at the

commencement of an incident, there is no requirement that both

perpetrators should be physically present at the culmination of the

event unless it could be shown by some overt act that one perpetrator

Page 5 of 12

deliberately withdraw from the situation to disengage and detach

himself from vicarious liability.

It is also important to note that in the case of Queen V. Mahathun - 61

NLR 540, it was held that to establish an existence of a common

intention, it is not essential to prove that the criminal act was done in

concert pursuant to a pre-arranged plan. A common intention can come

into existence without pre-arrangement. It can be formed on the spur

of the movement. In this judgment; it is clearly explained as follows

how the criminal liability arises under Section 32 of the Penal Code:

Under Section 32 of the Penal Code, when a criminal act is committed

by one of several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all,

each of them is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done

by him alone. If each of several persons commits a different criminal

act, each act being in furtherance of the common intention of all, each

of them is liable for each such if it were done by him alone.

Considering the aforesaid decisions, it has to be determined whether

the appellant has committed the offence of murder with a common

intention with the first accused. Before addressing this main issue of

common intention, I intend to consider the impact of rejecting the

evidence of PW-3 by the learned trial Judge. The learned Judge stated

in his Judgment that contradictions up to V-8 were marked between

the evidence of PW-3 and her statement to the Police. In addition,

contradictions between her evidence at the trial and evidence at the

inquest were marked as V-10 to V-17. When marking many

contradictions with her evidence in the inquest proceedings, PW-3 had

stated that she did not make those statements when giving evidence at

the Inquest. The learned Judge found that PW-3 had not signed her

recorded evidence at the inquest proceedings. In the circumstances, the

learned Judge took the view that it is not safe to consider those

contradictions between her evidence and inquest proceedings as the

inquest proceedings had not been signed by her and by other witnesses

Page 6 of 12

who gave evidence in the inquest as well. That is why the learned trial

Judge decided not to consider the evidence of PW-3 in determining this

action.

The contention of the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant was

that failing to consider the contradictions marked in the evidence of

PW-3 caused prejudice to the appellant because if those contradictions

were considered, a reasonable doubt would have been created in the

prosecution case. However, the learned Presidents Counsel did not

explain how the non-consideration of PW-3s evidence affects the

credibility of the prosecution case. I regret that I am unable to agree

with that contention of the learned Presidents Counsel because failing

to consider the evidence of PW-3, who testified as an eyewitness, would

be a disadvantage for the prosecution and not for the accused-appellant

because the prosecution had to prove the charges beyond a reasonable

doubt with the testimony of other witnesses in the absence of the

testimony of one of the eyewitnesses.

Now, I proceed to consider whether there was sufficient evidence to

prove the common intention of the appellant. As stated previously in

this judgment, one of the main contentions of the learned Presidents

Counsel was that there was no proof that the fatal injury was caused

by the appellant or there was no proof that the appellant had a common

intention in committing the murder.

In evaluating the evidence, the learned trial Judge considered PW-1 and

PW-4 as reliable witnesses and acted upon their evidence. The learned

Judge has correctly observed that they had given evidence after 12

years of the incident and it is natural to occur discrepancies and

omissions in their evidence. However, as there were no vital

contradictions or omissions that affected the credibility of their

testimony, the learned Judge acted upon their evidence. In the

judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai V.

Page 7 of 12

State of Gujarat -AIR 1983 SC 753 it was held as follows: By and

large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic memory

and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape is

replayed on the mental screen. Ordinarily, it so happens that a witness

is overtaken by events. The witness could not have anticipated the

occurrence which so often has an element of surprise. The mental

faculties therefore cannot be expected to be attuned to absorb the details.

The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may

notice, another may not. An object or movement might emboss its image

on one persons mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part of

another. Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately

the sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

time span. A witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when

interrogated later on. I agree with the learned trial Judge that the

discrepancies that have arisen in the evidence of PW-1 and PW-4 are

the discrepancies that can arise in the testimony of any human being

when he testifies after twelve years. As there were no vital

contradictions or omissions that affected the credibility of PW-1 or PW-

4, the learned High Court Judge is correct in acting on their testimony.

According to PW-4, she had heard a loud voice saying

Then, she saw the appellant and the first accused coming

armed with an iron bar and a dagger and grabbed the deceased. As they

were twins, PW-4 could not identify who was armed with an iron bar

and who was armed with a dagger. She also could not say who shouted.

However, it is evident that the appellant or his brother, the first accused

shouted. According to the appellants dock statement, the first accused

was his younger brother. That is why he has stated in his dock

statement that when there was a fight between the deceased and his

younger brother, he went to resolve it. Therefore, it must be the first

accused who was appellants younger brother who shouted

. It is important to note that none of the aforementioned items

of evidence were challenged in cross-examination. At least, it has not

Page 8 of 12

been suggested to PW-4 on behalf of the appellant that her evidence of

hearing such shouting is false or that her evidence that one of them

came with an iron bar and the other person came with a dagger is false.

In the case of Himachal Pradesh V. Thakur Dass (1983) 2 Cri. L.J.

1694 at 1701 V.D. Misra CJ held that whenever a statement of fact

made by a witness is not challenged in cross-examination, it has to be

concluded that the fact in question is not disputed. Similarly, in Motilal

V. State of Madhya Pradesh (1990) Criminal Law Journal NOC 125

MP it was held that Absence of cross-examination of prosecution

witness of certain facts, leads to inference of admission of that fact.

It was held in the previously stated judgment of Queen V. Mahatun,

that it is not essential to prove a pre-arranged plan to establish the

existence of a common intention. However, in the case at hand, the pre-

arrangement is clearly established because when the twin brothers

reached the house of the deceased, the first accused had told, brother

come, he is here ( , ). Thereafter, both of them grabbed

the deceased and assaulted him. It clearly reflects that the appellant

came with his brother in search of the deceased. Their common

intention with a pre-plan of causing a fatal injury to the deceased is

also apparent as they came with an iron bar and a dagger.

The Assistant Judicial Medical Officer was of the opinion that the fatal

head injury could have been caused by an iron bar. PW-1 stated that

twin brothers came together, they assaulted the deceased and one of

them struck the deceased with an iron bar. PW-4 has also stated in her

evidence that the first accused and the appellant came together, they

caught and held the deceased, and the deceased was beaten. She stated

further that three of them wrestled there, then the deceased fell on the

ground and after he fell, two of them continued to beat the deceased.

Furthermore, PW-4 stated that the deceased had been dragged about

fifty meters from home and even when the police officers came there,

two of them were beating the deceased.

Page 9 of 12

PW-12, the police officer who went there during the incident,

corroborates the evidence of PW-4. He stated in his evidence that when

he was going to the place of the incident with the other police officers

after receiving a complaint from the wife of the deceased, they saw two

people beating the deceased who had fallen, and when they saw the

police officers, they ran away. Police officers chased the two persons

and on two occasions they were caught. The appellant and the first

accused were identified as the persons who ran away. So, from the

evidence of the police officer, PW-12, who can be considered as an

independent witness, it is established that the appellant, together with

PW-1, were beating the deceased.

It is precisely clear from the aforesaid items of evidence that the

appellants presence at the scene is not mere presence, but a

participatory presence." It is established from the evidence of PW-1,

PW-4, and PW-12 that the first accused and the appellant came

together armed with an iron bar and a dagger in search of the deceased,

both of them caught the deceased, assaulted the deceased when

fighting with him; even after the deceased fell on the ground, they

continuously beat the deceased for some time; during this attack, one

of them caused the fatal injury to the deceased by using the iron bar.

After causing the fatal injury, when they saw police officers, both of

them ran away.

Therefore, from the very inception of the incident until they ran away

after causing the fatal injury to the deceased, the appellant was not only

physically present at the crime scene but also actively engaged with the

first accused in committing the crime with murderous intention. Hence,

whoever of them inflicted the fatal blow to the deceased using the iron

bar, sharing of common intention by the appellant with the first

accused to commit the murder is well established by the manner in

which the appellant acted. Even if the first accused had inflicted the

fatal blow by using the iron bar, the appellant is liable under Section

32 of the Penal Code for committing the offence of murder, as it is

Page 10 of 12

evident from the circumstances explained above that the appellant and

the first accused were acting in furtherance of their common intention

to kill the deceased.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant advanced an

argument that the learned trial Judge had not considered the injuries

sustained by the appellant. It transpired from the evidence that during

this incident, the appellant sustained injuries and was hospitalized.

But no evidence was adduced with regard to his injuries. However, it is

my view that failure to adduce evidence regarding the appellants

injuries has no effect in determining this action. The appellant and his

brother, the first accused, had gone to the place where the deceased

was residing; they caught the deceased, and then there was a fight

among the deceased, the first accused, and the appellant.

However, it is apparent that the deceased did not caused injuries to the

appellant first. PW-1 and PW-4 clearly explained that the appellant and

the first accused came to the house of the deceased and they started

assaulting the deceased. Even after the deceased was fallen on the

ground, both of them were attacking the deceased. After inflicting the

fatal injury on the deceased, PW-12, the police officer saw both of them

running away. So, within the cause of that fight, the appellant may have

sustained injuries. The fact that the appellant was injured during the

assault on the deceased has no bearing on the conclusion that the

appellant had participated in the crime with the common murderous

intention in committing this murder.

Another ground of appeal urged by the learned Presidents Counsel is

that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider the dock statement

properly. The appellant, in his statement from the dock stated that

... . What he said was

that I was attacked by the same thing that was used to attack the

deceased. However, the appellant has not disclosed who attacked.

Analyzing the dock statement, the learned High Court Judge stated in

Page 11 of 12

his judgment that the only explanation that can be given to the said

statement of the appellant is that his brother has assaulted him by

something that was used to attack the deceased.

There is nothing wrong with that observation made by the learned

Judge because it is apparent from the evidence that only the appellant,

the first accused, and the deceased were there when this incident

occurred. Therefore, the appellants brother must have attacked the

deceased with some weapon, as it was not possible for the deceased to

attack himself. In the said circumstances, the only inference that could

be drawn from the appellants statement that ...

. is that the appellants brother has

attacked the appellant by using the same thing that was used to attack

the deceased.

In addition, the third ground raised by the learned Presidents Counsel

was that the learned trial Judge expected proof of the defence case. The

learned Trial Judge observed that the defence that was taken in the

dock statement that he went to the place of the incident to settle the

dispute had not been suggested to the prosecution witnesses and

therefore, the unreliable dock statement does not cast a reasonable

doubt on the prosecution case. The contention of the learned Presidents

Counsel was that the said observation is erroneous because it amounts

to proving of the defence case.

I regret that I am unable to agree with the said contention of the learned

Presidents Counsel because if the appellant took up a certain position

that was not taken up in cross-examining the prosecution witnesses, it

is correct to conclude that it is an unacceptable afterthought. When

PW-1 and PW-4 stated in their evidence that the appellant and the first

accused came together armed with an iron bar and a dagger, it has not

been even suggested to these witnesses that the appellant did not come

with the first accused, and he came later to that place. In addition, it

has not been suggested to the prosecution witnesses that the appellant

Page 12 of 12

came to this place to settle the dispute that had arisen between the

deceased and his brother, the 1st accused. So, these items of evidence

are unchallenged.

The Indian judgment of Sarvan Singh V. State of Punjab (2002 AIR

SC (iii) 3652) pages 3655 and 3656, was cited in the case of Ratnayake

Mudiyanselage Premachandra V. The Hon. Attorney General C.A.

Case No. 79/2011, decided on 04.04.2017 as follows: It is a rule of

essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to avail

himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross-examination, it must

follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted.

Therefore, the evidence of the prosecution that the appellant came

together with the first accused to the house of the deceased armed with

an iron bar and a dagger is unchallenged. In the circumstances, the

learned Trial Judge is correct in not accepting the entirely different

story narrated by the appellant from the dock.

For the above reasons, I am of the view that none of the grounds of

appeal urged by the learned President Counsel for the appellant

warrants interference by this Court with the Judgment of the learned

High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the Judgment dated 29.07.2020, the Conviction and the

Sentence imposed on the 2nd accused-appellant are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
