Before: Sampath B. Abayakoon, J. Amal Ranaraja, J.

Counsel: Mahinda Jayawardena for the Accused-Appellant, Shanaka Wijesinghe A.S.G., P.C., for the State. Argued on: 24.10.2024 Decided on: 16.12.2024

JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant)

was indicted in the High Court of Hambantota on the following

count:

That, on or about 18.04.1999, the appellant committed

the murder of one Gamage Somawathie, which is an

offence punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

2. The appellant has pleaded not guilty to the count and the matter

has proceeded to trial without a jury.

3. At the conclusion of the trial, the Learned High Court Judge has

found the appellant guilty to the count, convicted and sentenced

him to death. The appellant, aggrieved by the judgement and the

sentencing order, has preferred the instant appeal to this Court.

3

4. When the matter was taken up for argument, the Learned Counsel

for the appellant formulated the following grounds of appeal;

i) Has the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt?

ii) Did the appellant get an opportunity for a fair trial as he was

not allowed to cross-examine PW-02, PW-03 and PW-05?

iii) Were PW-01, PW-03, PW-04 not eye-witnesses? Therefore,

did the Learned Trial Judge misdirect himself in considering

them as eye-witnesses?

iv) Was the condition of light not satisfactory? However, did the

Learned Trial Judge consider light as sufficient?

v) Was the alibi not taken into consideration and/or analysed

in the correct legal perspective by the Learned Trial Judge?

Facts in Brief:

5. The deceased is the wife of PW-01. PW-01 is attached to the

prisons department, while the deceased had been a house-wife.

PW-01 and the deceased have been living in their house in

Chitragalla, Ambalantota with their children. PW-03 is the

daughter of PW-01 and the deceased. On 18.04.1999, around

21.30 hrs, the appellant had come to the house of PW-01,

4

damaged its fuse board, shut out the electricity supply to the

house, challenged PW-01 and threatened to kill the persons living

inside the house. PW-01, the deceased and PW-03 have called out

for help from the neighbours.

6. PW-02, Dharmasena Jayawickrama has gone to PW-01s house

and upon inquiry, invited PW-01 and the others to come over to

his house until some action is taken to thwart the uncouth

behavior of the appellant. PW-01, the deceased and PW-03 have

walked up to the access road (which was abutting the lands of

PW-01, PW-02 and others) and stood there expecting the son of

PW-01 and the deceased to come back from the city after dropping

off a person known to them for the bus.

7. The appellant at about that time has struck PW-04, the friend of

the son of PW-01, with an iron pole while returning with the

former from the city. The appellant has also struck the deceased

on the forehead with the iron pole and when the deceased fell onto

the ground, the appellant has struck the deceased again with the

same device and run away.

The deceased has died on the spot.

PW-09 [ R.P.C. 1179, Wimalasena] has recorded the first

complaint.

PW-08 [ IP Ayub Khan] upon being informed about the first

complaint, has visited the scene of the crime in the early hours of

the morning on 19.04.1999 and made notes of his observations.

5

8. PW-11 [P.C. 29001, Dayarathe], as an officer involved in the

investigation of the crime has recorded the statements of PW-02

and PW-04 on 19.04.1999.

9. The post-mortem on the deceased has been conducted by PW-05,

Dr. D. A. R. J. Kumara, the medical officer of the Hambantota

hospital at that time. Dr. Kumara has observed six injuries on the

body of the deceased. A deep laceration, an abrasion and

contusions have been the nature of those injuries. Two contusions

on the head of the deceased have correspondingly resulted in

carnio-cerebrial injuries. Dr. Kumara has expressed an opinion

that the carnio-cerebrial injuries have caused the death of the

deceased.

10. The Counsel for the appellant has complained that, the appellant

has been denied a fair trial as the Learned High Court Judge has

disallowed an application on the behalf of the appellant to re-call

PW-02, PW-03 and PW-05 to be presented for cross-examination.

11. The appellant has been absconding from the time of the crime.

The appellant has not been arrested by the police. The non-

summary proceedings too have commenced and proceeded in the

absence of the appellant. When the indictment was forwarded to

the High Court of Hambantota, the appellant has not appeared or

has not been caused to be brought before the relevant High Court.

The Court has satisfied itself that the appellant is absconding and

therefore, it was not possible to serve the indictment of the

appellant. The trial in the High Court has commenced in the

6

absence of the appellant and PW-01, PW-02, PW-03, PW-05, PW-

08, and PW-09 have testified on behalf of the prosecution under

such circumstances.

12. On 20.03.2013, an Attorney-at-Law, by the name of Sunil R De

Silva has informed Court that he has received instructions to

defend the appellant henceforth and made an application to re-

call PW-01 to be presented for cross-examination. The Learned

High Court Judge has allowed such application. PW-01, has been

re-called and cross-examined on behalf of the appellant.

Subsequently, PW-04, PW-08, PW-09, PW10, PW-11 and the

mudaliyar of the Court have been examined in chief, cross-

examined, re-examined and the evidence of those witnesses

concluded. The case of the prosecution has been concluded on

07.12.2016 after the evidence of the mudaliyar of the Court was

led as its final witness.

13. On 15.02.2017, [DW-02 Sabapathi Ranhoti Gamage Kaushalya]

has been examined by the Counsel of the appellant and the

testimony of DW-02 concluded subsequent to the cross-

examination and re-examination of such witness.

14. Thereafter, on 11.10.2017, the Counsel for the appellant has

made a further application in Court. In making such application,

drawn the attention of the Learned High Court Judge to the

provisions in Section 138 (4) of the Evidence Ordinance No.14 of

1895 and Section 241(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979. In construing the provisions in those sections, the

Learned Counsel has contended that the appellant is entitled to

7

recall PW-02, PW-03 and the other witnesses who had been

examined by the Learned State Counsel but not cross-examined

by the former. The Learned High Court Judge has refused such

application.

15. Proviso to Section 138(4) of the Evidence Ordinance No.14 of

1895 is as follows;

The Court may in all cases permit a witness to be

recalled either for further examination-in-chief or for

further cross-examination, and if it does so the parties

have the right of further cross-examination

respectively.

16. In R vs. Pinhamy [57 NLR page 169], Basnayake A.C.J. has

stated,

The court is not bound to permit a witness to be re-

called whenever an application is made in that behalf

under section 138 (4) of the Evidence Ordinance, unless

the party making the application gives satisfactory

reasons.

17. When I draw my attention to the proceedings in the High Court

of Hambantota in the instant case dated 11.10.2017, it is clear to

me that that the Counsel for the appellant has merely drawn the

attention of the Court to the provisions in Section 138 (4) of the

Evidence Ordinance and stated that the Court in using its

discretion could recall those witnesses to be presented for cross-

examination. No satisfactory reason has been given to explain as

8

to why the Counsel for the appellant could not make such an

application when he did so to have PW-01 re-called to be

presented for cross-examination. The delay in making such an

application has not been explained. In those circumstances,

satisfactory reasons have not been drawn out by the Counsel for

appellant to re-call those witnesses as per the provision in Section

138 (4) of the Evidence Ordinance.

18. Section 241 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15

of 1979 is as follows;

(3) Where in the course of or after the conclusion of the

trial of an accused person under sub-paragraph (i) of

paragraph (a) of subsection (1) or under paragraph (b)

of that subsection he appears before court and satisfied

the court that his absence from the whole or part of the

trial was bona fide then

(a) where the trial has not been concluded, the evidence

led against the accused up to the time of his

appearance before court shall be read to him and an

opportunity afforded to him to cross-examine the

witnesses who gave such evidence; and

(b) where the trial has been concluded, the court shall set

aside the conviction and sentence, if any, and order

that the accused be tried de novo.

9

19. In Rajapakse vs. The State [2001 2 SLR 161 at page 166]

Kulathilaka J, has stated,

According to Section 241(3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act, No. 15 of 1979 after the conclusion of

the trial of an accused person in his absence if he

appears before Court and satisfies the Court that his

absence at the trial was bona fide the Court shall set

aside the conviction and sentence and order that the

accused be tried de novo.

20. Due to the matters discussed above, it is very clear that an

application under Section 241(3) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act could be made when the relevant accused is

present in person in a High Court and not when a Counsel

defending an accused is only present in Court without his client.

Accordingly, the complaint that the appellant has been denied a

fair trial must fail.

21. PW-01 has stated that though the only street light which was

situated close to the scene of the crime was out of order, the lights

from the nearby houses have lit up the road on which the incident

took place. Though PW-02 has stated that the lights of his house

did not light up the road, the lights of the other houses abutting

the road on which the crime took place have been functioning.

PW-08 [IP Ayub Khan] who visited the scene of the crime when

examined has confirmed the fact that the lights of the houses of

Adlin Nona and Samarapala were functioning at that time and

those lights lit up the place where the body of the deceased was

10

lying. Hence, there is ample evidence to conclude that the scene

of crime was illuminated in a sufficient manner to identify the

appellant whose identity was known to PW-01 and the other

witnesses as the appellant was a resident of the same

neighbourhood.

22. PW-01 and PW-03 have stated that the appellant came to their

house on the particular day and threatened to kill them. Further,

the electricity supply to the house has been disconnected as soon

as the appellant came that way. PW-01, the deceased and PW-03

have called out for help from the neighbours when the appellant

threatened to kill them. PW-01 has identified the voice of the

appellant when PW-01 and the others in the household were

threatened. PW-01 and the others in his household on occasions

have spoken to the appellant and his voice has been familiar to

them. PW-02 has come to the house of PW-01 and inquired from

him what the matter was, then invited PW-01, the deceased and

PW-03 to go to his house until the uncouth behavior of the

appellant settles down. PW-01, PW-03 and the deceased have

walked towards the road that abutted the plots of land in which

the witnesses lived in. Such road has been the access road to the

respective plots of land. The deceased had been on the road when

the appellant struck the deceased with an iron pole. PW-01 has

witnessed the appellant striking the deceased. Though PW-03 has

said that the appellant had in his possession a device similar to a

crow-bar, she has not stated that it was actually a crow-bar. In

those circumstances the similarities of a crow-bar

11

and an iron pole should be looked at in a proper perspective. The

possibility of mistaken identity of the weapon in such a situation

should also be looked at in a proper perspective. It is narrated that

the deceased was struck on her forehead in the first instance,

when she fell to the ground she has been struck again by the

appellant. PW-05 i.e. Dr. Kumara has during the post-mortem

examination observed two contusions on the head of the deceased

and the corresponding carnio-cerebrial injuries had caused the

death of the deceased. They have been necessarily fatal injuries.

PW-01 in his evidence has stated the fact that he left PW-03 in a

house close by that night just before the appellant struck the

deceased. However, PW-03 has stated that she was at the scene

when the appellant struck her mother. PW-03 has also stated that

she saw the appellant striking her mother. The Learned Counsel

for the appellant has complained that PW-03 had not been at the

scene of the incident and had not seen the appellant strike the

deceased. PW-02 in his evidence has stated that PW-01, PW-03

and the deceased stopped on the road in anticipation of the arrival

of their/her son/brother who had gone to the city. PW-02 does

not state of an incident where PW-01 took PW-03 to a house close

by. Further, PW-02 has heard a commotion within a short period

of time of his going into his house. When he came out to see what

the commotion was he has seen the appellant strike the deceased.

PW-02 has also observed the fact that the fuse box of PW-01s

house was damaged when he went there to inquire from PW-01

as to what the calls for help were. PW-03 in her evidence has

stated that after seeing her mother (the deceased) being struck,

she fainted. She being a fourteen-year old girl at the time of the

incident, the distressing experience of seeing her mother being

12

struck by the appellant, the scenario described by PW-03 cannot

be ruled out. It is a possibility. This Court also finds the testimony

of PW-03 to be natural and straightforward. There is no material

on record to show that PW-03 was tutored or influenced by PW-

01 or any other person of concern. Therefore, the testimony of PW-

03 should be accepted and acted upon. PW-04 also has stated

that the appellant struck him with an iron pole when he was

returning with the son of PW-01 to the house of the latter. In those

circumstances, the discrepancy could be attributed to lack of

precise narration.

23. In Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai vs. State of Gujarat [A. I.

R. 1983 SC 753] it was held,

a witness cannot be expected to possess a

photographic memory and to recall the details of an

incident. It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the

mental screen...Discrepancies which do not go to the

root of the matter and shake the version of the witness,

therefore cannot be annexed with undue importance.

24. In consideration of the above it is the view of this Court, that the

evidence of eye-witnesses i.e. PW-01 and PW-03 are consistent

and conclusive in respect of the material facts of the case. There

are no inconsistencies which affect the substance of the case.

13

25. DW-01 has stated that the appellant had told her that he was

going to Colombo for five days beginning 16.04.1999. DW-01 has

also stated that she did not see the appellant leaving for Colombo

but only stated so to her. PW-01, PW-02 and PW-04 have

corroborated the fact that the appellant was seen at the scene of

the crime on the date the crime was committed by him. Hence, the

evidence of DW-01 cannot be relied upon as her evidence has been

countered by those of PW-01, PW-02 and PW-04. Further, the

appellant through DW-01 has suddenly introduced the defense of

alibi at the tail end of the case. Such an eventuality or an event

has not been suggested to the prosecution witnesses in cross

examination by the appellant. I draw my attention to such

inconsistency on the part of the appellant.

26. The Learned High Court Judge has in the disputed judgement

referred to a deceased name, Ellawala Pahalage Wimal

Weerasinghe, who was murdered on 11.02.1982. It appears the

typographical error has been made in page 310 of the brief in

reference to a different case. This error appears to have taken

place when the Learned High Court Judge attempted to list the

elements required to be proven to constitute the offence of murder.

The Learned High Court Judge at the beginning of the disputed

judgement has referred to the count in the indictment forwarded

in this case. Further, the Learned High Court Judge has also

evaluated the evidence led in this case, decided that the evidence

led by the prosecution in this case was cogent and convincing.

Acting upon such evidence, has convicted the appellant for the

count in the indictment forwarded in this case. Hence, it is my

view that such error has not occasioned in a failure of justice.

14

27. Due to the preceding reasons I am not inclined to interfere with

the disputed judgement. We affirm to the conviction and the

sentence imposed by the Learned High Court Judge and dismiss

the appeal.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate the

judgment to the High Court of Hambantota for compliance.

Appeal dismissed.
