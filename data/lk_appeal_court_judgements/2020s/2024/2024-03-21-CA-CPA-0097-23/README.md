This is an application by the accused-appellant-petitioner (hereinafter referred

to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court

granted in terms of Article 138 of The Constitution.

By this application, the petitioner is seeking to set aside the judgement

pronounced by the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the North Western

Province Holden in Chilaw, in case No-HCA/02/2022.

This is a judgement pronounced after hearing an appeal preferred before the

High Court in terms of Article 154P of the Constitution, challenging the

conviction and the sentence of the petitioner pronounced by the learned

Magistrate of Chilaw.

The petitioner has been charged before the Magistrates Court of Chilaw for

committing four offences relating to a foreign job transaction.

The 1st count had been under the Penal Code where the petitioner has been

charged for cheating, punishable in terms of section 403 of the Penal Code.

The 2nd count had been in terms of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment

Act as amended for cheating Rs. 200,000/- from one Mohamed Fasoor, and

thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of section 13 of the said Act.

The 3rd count had been to the effect that at the same transaction, she committed

the criminal breach of trust, an offence punishable in terms of section 389 of the

Penal Code.

The 4th count had been that the petitioner, at the same time and at the same

transaction, had committed criminal misappropriation, punishable in terms of

section 386 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned Magistrate of Chilaw by the judgement dated 08-03-2021

has found the petitioner guilty for the 1st, 3rd and 4th counts preferred against

her and she had been acquitted on the 2nd count, namely, the count under which

Page 5 of 12

the petitioner was charged in terms of the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign

Employment Act.

After having considered the mitigatory circumstances urged on behalf of the

petitioner, the learned Magistrate has sentenced her in the following manner.

On count 1, Rs. 1,500/- fine, and in default, 1 month simple imprisonment. In

addition, she has been sentenced to 1-year simple imprisonment, which has

been suspended for a period of 5 years.

On count 3 and 4, the petitioner has been sentenced for Rs. 1,500/- each fine,

and in default, she has been ordered to serve one month each simple

imprisonment.

In addition to the above, the learned Magistrate, acting in terms of section 17 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and in terms of Assistance To and Protection

of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No. 10 of 2023, has ordered the petitioner

to pay Rs. 200,000/- as compensation to PW-01, and in default, to serve 3

months simple imprisonment.

It is against this conviction and the sentence; the petitioner has preferred this

appeal to the Provincial High Court of the North Western Province Holden in

Chilaw.

After hearing the appeal, the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the North

Western Province Holden in Chilaw, of the judgement dated 09-08-2023, has

partly allowed the appeal. It has been determined that the petitioner should

stand acquitted of the 1st and the 3rd counts preferred against her as well.

However, the learned High Court Judge has affirmed the conviction of her for the

4th count, namely, the count relating to criminal misappropriation.

After having determined as such, the learned High Court Judge has decided to

vary and enhance the sentence that has been imposed by the learned Magistrate

of Chilaw on the 4th count preferred against the petitioner.

Page 6 of 12

Accordingly, a sentence of 6 months rigorous imprisonment together with a fine

of Rs. 1500/- has been imposed with a default sentence of one month

imprisonment. It has also been ordered that the petitioner should pay Rs.

200,000/- to PW-01 as compensation, and in default, she should serve a

sentence of 3 months simple imprisonment.

It is against this judgement; the petitioner has now preferred this revision

application before this Court.

When this matter was supported for notice and for a stay order of the sentence,

this Court, after having considered the facts, circumstances and the law, decided

to issue notice and also to grant a stay order as prayed for in the petition.

At the hearing of this application, we heard the submissions of the learned

Presidents Counsel in support of this application and the views expressed by

the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) in this regard.

The primary submission of the learned Presidents Counsel was on the basis that

the learned High Court Judge, after determining the appeal, was misdirected

when the sentence already imposed by the learned Magistrate of Chilaw in

relation to the 4th count was enhanced, without following the due procedure. It

was his view that such an enhancement of the sentence is illegal and should be

set aside.

The learned DSG also viewed that this is a matter where this Court should clarify

and correct, as there appears to be a miscarriage of justice due to the procedural

defect in the manner in which the enhancement of the sentence was decided

upon by the learned High Court Judge.

This is an application in revision filed by the petitioner seeking to challenge a

judgement pronounced by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High

Court of the North Western Province Holden in Chilaw exercising the appellate

jurisdiction granted to the said Provincial High Court in terms of Article 154P of

the Constitution.

Page 7 of 12

For a person dissatisfied or aggrieved by such a judgement, the procedure that

has to be adopted is to file a leave to appeal application before the same High

Court and obtain leave to appeal to the Supreme Court or to file a special leave

to appeal application before the Supreme Court in terms of High Courts of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990.

However, the law relating to the right of a person to seek the remedy of revision

which is an extraordinary remedy that can only be exercised by the Court of

Appeal in its discretion has been now settled by the Supreme Court, where it has

been determined that irrespective of the requirement of obtaining leave to appeal

before the Supreme Court, the revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal can

also be sought by a party aggrieved by an appellate judgement of a Provincial

High Court exercised in terms of Article 154P of the Constitution.

Buwaneka Aluvihare, J. in SC Appeal No. 111-2015 with SC Appeal No. 113-

15 and SC Appeal No. 114-15 decided on 27-05-2020 stated that;

For the reasons set out in this judgement the said question of law is

answered as follows; Section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 as amended, does not oust the Revisionary

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in respect of decisions made by a

Provincial High Court exercising its appellate powers. Therefore, the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal referred to in Article 138 of the

Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka can be invoked in order to canvass

a decision made by a Provincial High Court exercising its appellate powers.

However, the fact remains that, for this Court to exercise revisionary jurisdiction,

there must be exceptional circumstances pleaded and established before this

Court to the Courts satisfaction.

It was held in the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. Vs. Mercantile Hotels

Management Ltd (1987) 1 SLR 5 that,

Page 8 of 12

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thamararatnam (Sriskantha Law Report Vol. IV

page 47) that,

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the

Court.

In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd. Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365 it

was observed,

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

occasioned due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of

justice.

Although some irregularities in the Magistrates Court case were also brought to

the notice at the hearing of this application, the enhancement of the sentence by

the learned High Court Judge was the main point of argument before this Court.

Hence, I will now consider whether there exist any exceptional circumstances for

this Court to intervene into the judgement of the learned High Court Judge of

Chilaw in relation to the enhancement of the sentence.

It is undisputed that the learned High Court Judge, after allowing the appeal in

relation to the 1st and the 3rd count (where the petitioner was convicted by the

learned Magistrate) and thereby acquitting the petitioner of the said counts, had

decided to enhance the sentence imposed upon the petitioner on the 4th count,

which is the only count that now stand against the prtitioner as a result of the

judgement pronounced in appeal.

The relevant section 336 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act in relation to

appeal from sentences which is also applicable to determining appeals preferred

Page 9 of 12

to the High Court of the Provinces in terms of Article 154P of the Constitution

reads as follows.

336. On an appeal against the sentence whether passed after trial by

jury or without a jury, the Court of Appeal shall, if it thinks that a

different sentence should have been passed, quash the sentence, and

pass other sentence warranted in law by the verdict (whether more or

less severe) in substitution therefor as it thinks ought to have been

passed and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.

The above-mentioned section clearly provides for the appellate Court to enhance

the sentence if it finds it justifiable to so enhance.

However, when enhancing a sentence which amounts to varying the sentence

upon which the accused person came before the appellate forum, it becomes

necessary for the appellate Court to give an opportunity to the accused-appellant

to show cause as to why the sentence against him should not be enhanced.

This procedure was followed in the case of Bandara Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka

(2002) 2 SLR 277, where it was stated by Gamini Amaratunga, J.,

We, therefore, called upon the accused-appellant to show cause why his

sentence should not be enhanced and we gave him time to show cause. The

learned Counsel appearing for the accused-appellant submitted that the

accused-appellant is the father of an infant child; that he is the sole

breadwinner of the family and that his incarceration will have an adverse

impact on his family.

We have carefully considered this submission, but we wish to state that we

have also considered plight of the families of those 14 persons who perished

in the accident due to the rash and negligent conduct of the accused-

appellant. Therefore, we cannot give any relief to the accused-appellant on

the basis of the submissions made on his behalf.

Page 10 of 12

The procedure upon which a sentence already entered can be enhanced upon an

appeal was well considered by Shiran Gooneratne, J. in SC Appeal No. 115-

2019 decided on 04-04-2022.

This was a case where the accused-appellant-petitioner was charged for

negligent driving, failure to avoid an accident, failure to report an accident in

terms of the Motor Traffic Act, and also for reckless and negligent driving, an

offence punishable in terms of section 329 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned Magistrate found the said accused-appellant guilty for the

1st, 2nd and 4th counts and sentenced him, where the learned Magistrate imposed

a simple imprisonment period of 3 months which was suspended for a period of

5 years in relation to the 4th count, in addition to the fine imposed on the said

count. On the 1st and the 2nd count, he was imposed a fine only.

After hearing an appeal filed by the accused-appellant challenging the said

conviction and the sentence, the relevant Provincial High Court affirmed the

conviction on all counts but converted the suspended sentence into an active

sentence of 3 months simple imprisonment.

After having considered the procedure followed to enhance a sentence in

Bandara Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka (supra), his lordship cited the judgement

pronounced by the Supreme Court in SC/SPL/LA No. 201/2006 where it was

held that;

It is a cardinal principle that the accused person ought to be given an

opportunity to present to Court he might have against the enhancement of

the sentence.

Held:

The question of law raised by the petitioner is based upon a failure of

natural justice by not affording an opportunity to the petitioner to be heard

Page 11 of 12

prior to the said variation in sentence. A basic principle of procedural

safeguards is that a mans defence must be heard fairly.

An omission to give a party to a suit an opportunity of being heard is not

merely an omission of procedure, but is a far more fundamental matter in

that it is contrary to the rule of natural justice embodied in the maxim audi

alteram partem. (Dharmadasa Vs. Piyadasa (2008) BLR 208)

It is clear from the appellate judgement of the learned Provincial High Court

Judge of the North Western Province Holden in Chilaw dated 09-06-2023, that

no opportunity has been given to the petitioner to show cause as to why the

sentence imposed on her by the learned Magistrate of Chilaw on the 4th count

preferred should not be enhanced.

The reasons given by the learned High Court Judge are not reasons based after

providing an opportunity to the petitioner to show cause in that regard.

Therefore, I am of the view that this procedural irregularity has caused a

miscarriage of justice towards her which amounts to sufficient exceptional

circumstances requiring the intervention of this Court under the revisionary

jurisdiction granted to this Court in terms of Article 138 of the Constitution.

Therefore, I set aside the 6 months rigorous imprisonment period that has been

imposed upon the petitioner on count 4 preferred against her where she now

stands convicted in terms of the appellate judgement and reimpose the sentence

given by the learned Magistrate of Chilaw in that regard, namely, a fine of Rs.

1500/- and in default, 1-month simple imprisonment.

Since the compensation which amounts to Rs. 200,000/- to be paid to PW-01

has been ordered in terms of section 17 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

and also Assistance To and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No.

10 of 2023, which is an order in addition to the sentence imposed, the said order

and the default sentence ordered by the learned Magistrate in that regard shall

remain the same.

Page 12 of 12

Subject to the above variation to the judgement of the learned Provincial High

Court Judge of the North Western Province Holden in Chilaw. The revision

application is partly allowed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the

Provincial High Court of the North Western Province Holden in Chilaw and also

to the Magistrates Court of Chilaw for necessary action.
