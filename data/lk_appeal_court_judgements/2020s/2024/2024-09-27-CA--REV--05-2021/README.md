The 2nd and 3rd Defendant-Petitioners filled the revision application on 26th October 2021,

seeking the following reliefs;

a) Issue notices on the Respondents;

b) Grant Leave to Appeal from the said Order marked as X3;

c) Grant and issue a stay order staying any further proceedings of the Commercial

High Court in case no. CHC/174/2018/MR until the final determination of this

Application;

d) Clarify and/or Rectify and/or Vary the Order dated 25.11.2019 marked X3;

e) In the alternative to (d) above, set aside the Order dated 25.11.2019 and direct that

a fresh hearing be conducted on the application made by way of Motion dated

03.10.2018;

f) Grant costs; and

g) Grant such other and further relief as to this Court may seem meet.

The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) has instituted an

action bearing case no. CHC/174/2018/MR in the Commercial High Court of Colombo

against the 1st to 4th Defendant-Petitioners to recover a sum of Rs. 5,030,000/- due on a

loan given to the 1st Defendant-Respondent Company.

The said Company is incorporated under and in terms of the Companies Act of Sri Lanka.

The 2nd and 3rd Defendant-Petitioners are the Directors of the said Company. The 4th

Defendant is the guarantor.

On or around 05.06.2015, an agreement was entered into between the Plaintiff and the

1st Defendant Company. According to the said agreement, the Plaintiff has given financial

Page 5 of 7

facility amounting to Rs. 2,500,000/- for a duration of 2 years. In the said agreement, the

Defendant Company has agreed, in the event of default, a default interest of Rs.10,000/-

per day for the delay of payment. However, the Defendant Company has failed to repay

the loan. Therefore, on or around 09.08.2017, a Letter of Demand was sent to the

Defendant Company that they have defaulted an amount totaling to Rs. 5,030,000/-. Since

the Defendants have failed to pay the amount, Plaintiff filed an action in the Commercial

High Court.

When the matter was taken up on 10.10.2018, a motion was filed on behalf of the 2nd and

3rd Defendants to the effect that, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants should be struck off in terms

of Section 18 of the Civil Procedure Code as the Directors are not parties to the agreement.

Thereafter, the Learned High Court Judge has directed to file written submissions.

On 25.11.2019, the Order was delivered directing the Plaintiff to take steps to issue

summons on the 4th Respondent. Thereafter, when the case was called on 25.02.2020, the

Court directed the 1st to 3rd Respondents to file the answer. Thereafter, after many

attempts, they have obtained a certified copy of the order delivered on 25.11.2019.

When they perused the said Order, they discovered that, the particular order does not

indicate whether the said motion was accepted or not. The said order was supposed to be

whether the application made by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants is allowed or dismissed. For

easy reference, an excerpt of the order made on 25.11.2019 is reproduced.

The Plaintiff in the 3rd paragraph of his Plaint admits that the alleged debtor of

the transaction that is in dispute is the 1st Defendant Company.

Nowhere in the Plaint has the Plaintiff stated that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are

the alleged debtors of the transaction that is in dispute.

Page 6 of 7

The Plaintiff admits in paragraph 4 of the Plaint that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants

are the Directors of the 1st Defendant Company. (vide paragraph 4 of the Plaint)

The 2nd and 4th Defendants have signed the agreement under dispute as Agents

of the 1st Defendant Company and not in their personal capacity.

When they made an application before the same Court, the Learned Commercial High

Court Judge informed that, the said order dated 25.11.2019 does not clearly state the fact

that, the application to discharge the 2nd and 3rd Defendants has been rejected. Further,

he informed that, he lacks jurisdiction to clarify the said order and if they wish, they can

seek clarification by invoking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal.

On that premises, the 2nd and 3rd Defendant-Petitioners have invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court.

We are mindful that, this is a revision application. Our Courts have considered that, the

revisionary jurisdiction is exercised especially to prevent the miscarriage of justice being

done to a person.

In Kulatilake v. Attorney General 2010 (1) SLR 212 His Lordship Chitrasiri J. held;

It is trite Law that the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court would be exercised if and

only if exceptional circumstances are in existence to file such an application. Moreover, it

must be noted that the Courts would exercise the revisionary jurisdiction, it being an

extraordinary power vested in Court, especially to prevent miscarriage of justice being

done to a person and/or for the due administration of justice.

In Geethani Nilushika Samarawickrama v. Waruni Harshani Samarawickrama and

Others, SC Appeal No: SC/Appeal/93/2017, decided on 18.06.2021, his Lordship Mahinda

Samayawardhena, J held that;

Page 7 of 7

The purpose of revisionary jurisdiction is to promote the due administration of

justice and correct miscarriage of justice. But it is well to remember that unlike in

an appeal, not every error of fact or law may be corrected in revision. In short, the

general ground that the Judgment is incorrect, which is sufficient to invoke the

statutory right of appeal, does not per se constitute an exceptional ground to invoke

the extraordinary jurisdiction of revision. The error complained of shall shock the

conscience of the Court.

The said order made on 25.11.2019 does not reflect the decision of the Learned Judge,

that is to say, whether he has accepted the position of the 2nd and 3rd Defendant

Petitioners that whether to release them from the proceedings or not.

For the above-said reasons, we set aside the order made on 25.11.2019 and direct the

Learned Commercial High Court Judge to have a fresh hearing to be conducted on the

application made by way of motion dated 03.10.2018.

No order for cost.
