and spare parts, and the sole owner of the individual business named

Chaminda Enterprises with the registration No. WR 37129. The

Appellant had imported a freezer truck bearing chassis No. NPR 85-

7015540.The Appellant used to sell and effect repairs if any, of his

vehicles through Kumar Car Sales owned by the Suspect-Respondent-

Respondent (Hereinafter referred to as the Suspect).

The Appellant brought the freezer truck mentioned above to Suspect s

car sale but retained all original documents with him. The Suspect had

agreed to sell the vehicle in dispute to 1st Party Claimant-Respondent-

Respondent (Hereinafter referred to as the 1st Party Claimant) for

Rs.4,950,000/-. According to the Appellant this intended transaction

was not intimated to him by the Suspect. The virtual complainant who

was a director of the 1st Party Claimant had paid the consideration in

two cheques and taken the possession of the vehicle. The Suspect had

under took to register the vehicle in the name of Virtual Complainant.

After about three months, the Suspect had removed the freezer truck

from Virtual Complainant claiming that it was necessary to take the

vehicle for inspection of the Registrar of Motor Vehicle to register it.

Thereafter, the Suspect had informed the Appellant that the vehicle was

available at Kumar Car Sales, the Appellant removed the vehicle and

brought to into another garage for remaining repairs.

On 08.01.2019, the Virtual Complainant had lodged a complaint at the

Awissavella Police Station that the Suspect had cheated him by taking

money but not provided the vehicle as contracted. On the same day, the

Complainant-Respondent-Respondent (Hereinafter referred to as the

Complainant) has seized the vehicle from the garage where the

Appellant had placed it for remaining repairs, in the absence of the

Appellant. The Appellant had lodged a complaint on the same day at the

Kandana Police Station in this regard.

CA PHC 147/2019

The Complainant reported the facts under B/79014 in the Magistrate

Court of Ruwanwella. In the meantime, the Appellant, by way of a

motion dated 30.01.2019 made an application to add him to the case as

a party. Further, the filed another motion dated 13.02.2019 requested

the Court to release the vehicle in question to the Appellant. After filing

second motion the Learned Magistrate of Ruwanwella directed the

Appellant to file all original import documents in the Court.

As the Court decided to adjudicate the matter by way of written

submissions, both parties had tendered their written submission and

the matter was fixed for order. Delivering the Order on 15.05.2019, the

Learned Magistrate had delivered the possession of the vehicle to 1st

Party Claimant.

Being aggrieved by said order, the Appellant filed a revision application

in the High Court of Kegalle under case No. 5527/REV. On 10.07.2019

when the matter was supported, the Learned High Court Judge of

Kegalle refused notice to the Respondent and dismissed the application.

Now the Appellant filed this appeal to set aside the order of the Learned

High Court Judge of Kegalle dated 10/07/2019.

The Appellant submitted following grounds of appeal:

1. The order of the Learned Magistrate in delivering possession of

the vehicle to the 1st Party Claimant is contrary to law and

precedent of the apex Courts.

2. The Learned Magistrate erred in law and fact, and has caused

grave prejudice to the Appellant in not considering and

scrutinizing the evidence and not complying with the legal

provisions on conducting the inquiry.

CA PHC 147/2019

3. The Learned High Court judge erred in law and fact when he

refused to issue notice and dismissed the revision application of

the Appellant.

Among the appeal grounds raised, the Appellant strenuously argued

that the decision of the Learned High Court Judge to not to issue notice

violates the maxim audi alteram partem. It is fundamental legal

principle in which each party is entitled to a fair hearing and given the

opportunity to respond to evidence against them.

In Commissioner of Police v. Tanes (1957-58) 68 CLR 383, the court

held that:

"It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone

can be punished or prejudiced in his person or his property

by any judicial or quasi-judicial procedure, he must be

afforded adequate opportunity of being heard ... "

In this case the Learned High Court Judge only considering the

judgment of the Magistrate Court of Ruwanwella decided to dismiss the

revision application stating that that the Appellant had failed shock the

conscious of the Court.

Considering the argument advanced by the Appellant that he was not

afforded a fair inquiry, I conclude that the Learned High Court Judge

should have inquired this matter by affording an opportunity to all

necessary parties to present their submissions before he could come to

a conclusion. As this caused great prejudice to the Appellant, I decide

to send this case back to the High Court of Kegalle for re-hearing by

affording an opportunity to all necessary parties to present their

submissions.

CA PHC 147/2019

Accordingly, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Kegalle dated 10.07.2019 and send the case back to the High Court for

a fresh hearing on merits, after issuing notice of this matter to the

relevant parties.

Therefore, this appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this order to the

Provincial High Court of Kegalle.

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
