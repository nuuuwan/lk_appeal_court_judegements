If a verdict of 'guilt' of an accused is arrived at without performing these functions in a lawful manner, indeed, as rightly pointed out by the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant, the accused can rightfully claim that he was deprived of a fair trial. A judgment of a criminal trial Court which does not reflect that these functions have been carried out by the learned trial judge in a lawful and sufficient manner, cannot be relied upon to satisfy an appellate Court that the accused had received a fair trial, and that he had been found 'guilty' in a lawful manner. However, a determination of whether or not the accused has been deprived of the constitutional right (in terms of Article 13(3) of the Constitution) to a fair trial should be founded upon not only whether or not the trial judge has correctly performed the above-mentioned functions, but also on a careful consideration of the totality of testimonies given by witnesses and the evidence of the case. However, it is important to note that a verdict arrived at without the proper performance of the afore-stated testimony and evidence related functions would be unlawful and hence should be vacated in appeal, only if such failure on the part of the trial judge had prejudiced the substantial rights of the accused or occasioned a failure of justice.",
