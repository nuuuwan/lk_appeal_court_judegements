Besides, the Petitioners failed to adduce evidence to buttress their contention that the constructions in dispute were built before the appointed date, namely 01-10-1983. The business known as the Beach Caf was registered with the Habararuwa Pradeshiya Sabhawa in 2023 [P15 (h)]. The Report marked as R4 substantiates the fact that the disputed unauthorized constructions are obstructing the road access to the beach. It is well established that the said constructions were built without the permit issued by the Director in terms of Section 14 (1) of the said Act and therefore, the same is liable to be demolished as it is an unauthorized construction. It appears to this Court that the Respondents have taken steps against the Petitioners pertaining to the constructions in suit within the purview of the said Act. As such, the Petitioners are not entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court seeking for discretionary remedies.",
