JUDGMENT

AMAL RANARAJA, J.

1. The Registered Owner-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant), a businessman by profession has utilized the vehicle

bearing Registration No. UP LL 0358 for his business purposes,

including to transport sand. Sand has been transported from

Mahiyangana to Hatton and the appellant has been in possession of a valid

permit for such purpose.

2. On 29.01.2015, the appellant as per the usual practice has handed over

the permit and the particular vehicle to its driver one, Rathnayake

Mudiyansilage Kumara Rathnayake to transport a load of sand from

4

Mahiyangana to Hatton. Unknown to the appellant the Kandaketiya Police

had arrested the driver for transporting timber without a valid permit in

terms of Section 24 (1) read with Sections 25 (2) and 40 of the Forest

Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 (as Amended). The Kandaketiya Police has also

seized the said vehicle bearing Registration No. UP LL 0358 which had

been used to transport the timber.

3. Thereafter, the Officer-in-Charge of the Kandaketiya Police Station has

filed action in the Badulla Magistrate Court against the driver referred to

above, for transporting timber without a valid permit, an offence in terms

of Section 24(1) and Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance. The driver (as the

accused) upon pleading guilty to the charge has been convicted and

sentenced.

4. Subsequently, a confiscation inquiry has been held regarding the vehicle

bearing Registration No. UP LL 0358. After the inquiry by order dated

22.02.2017, the Learned Magistrate has ordered the confiscation of the

said vehicle. Aggrieved by the order, the appellant has filed an

application in revision [HCRA 35/2017] in the High Court of Badulla. The

Learned High Court Judge by his order dated 25.06.2020 has dismissed

the revision application and affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate

dated 22.02.2017. The appellant also being aggrieved by the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of Badulla, dated 25.06.2020, has preferred the

instant appeal to this Court.

5. The facts of this appeal were not disputed. It is common ground that the

Officer-in-Charge of the Kandeketiya Police had instituted proceedings

5

against the driver i.e. Rathnayake Mudiyansilage Kumara Rathnayake for

transporting 14 logs of jack timber valued at Rs. 102,108.37 on 29.01.2015

without a permit and thereby committing an offence punishable in

Sections 24(1), 25(2) and 40 of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 (As

Amended).

6. Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance No. 16 of 1907 (As Amended)

provides,

(1) Where any person is convicted of a forest offence

(a) All timber of forest produce which is not the property of the State in

respect of which such offence has been committed; and

(b) all tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines used in

committing such offence,

shall in addition to any other punishment specified for such offence, be

confiscated by Order of the convicting Magistrate:

Provided that in any case where the owner of such tools, vehicles,

implements and machines used in the commission of such offence, is a

third party, no Order of Confiscation shall be made if such owner proves

to the satisfaction of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent

the use of such tools, vehicles, implements, cattle and machines, as the

case may be, for the commission of the offence.

(2) Any property forfeited to the State under subsection (1) shall

(a) if no appeal has been preferred to the Court of Appeal against the

relevant conviction, vest absolutely in the State with effect from the

date on which the period prescribed for preferring an appeal against

such conviction expires;

6

(b) if an appeal has been preferred to the Court of Appeal against the

relevant conviction, vest absolutely in the State with effect from the

date on which such conviction is affirmed on appeal.

In this subsection, relevant conviction means the conviction in

consequence of which any property is forfeited to the State under

subsection (1).

7. Section 40 of the Forest Ordinance states that upon a conviction, all

timber and forest produce that have been the subject matter of the offence

and vehicles used for the commission of such offence would be

confiscated. If the owner of a vehicle himself was the accused in the

preceding case then the issue before a Court in a confiscation inquiry will

not be complicated. However, if the owner is a third party, it would be

necessary for a Court to ascertain whether the offence has been

committed by a particular accused with the knowledge and the

connivance of the owner of such vehicle used for the commission of the

forest offence.

8. In The Finance Company PLC vs. Chandana and Others [SC Appeal No.

105A/2008 and SC. (SPL) L. A.166/2008], decided on 30.09.2010, Dr.

Shirani Bandaranayake CJ has stated,

(a) In terms of section 40 of the Forest Ordinance as amended, if the

owner of the vehicle in question was a third party, no order of

confiscation shall be made if that owner had proved to the satisfaction

of the Court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of

the said vehicle for the commission of the offence.

7

(b) It would be necessary for the owner of the vehicle to establish that

the vehicle that had been used for the commission of the offence had

been so used without his knowledge and that the owner had taken all

precautions available to prevent the use of the vehicle for the

commission of such an offence.

9. The Counsel for the appellant has contended that the Learned Magistrate

has erred in concluding that the evidence of the appellant (the registered

owner) alone was not sufficient to discharge the burden placed on a

third party owner in an inquiry of this nature.

10. The appellant as the registered owner of the vehicle in issue has given

evidence at the confiscation inquiry and he has been the only witness

called to give evidence on behalf of the owner. The appellant in his

evidence has stated that he had given instructions to the driver to not use

the said vehicle to commit an offence and on the days the vehicle was

used for the purpose of transporting sand, he had handed over the permit

obtained for such purpose to the driver to further emphasize the fact that

the vehicle should be used on those particular days for the purpose of

transporting sand only.

11. The evidence of the registered owner is cogent and impressive. The

credibility of the appellant as a witness has not been impeached. Hence,

8

irrefutable evidence has been provided by the appellant on a balance of

probability that necessary precautions have been taken by him as the

owner of the vehicle to prevent the commission of an offence, using such

a vehicle.

12. In Adambarage Kelum Thushantha Alwis vs. The Attorney General [CA

(PHC) 211/ 2019] decided on 07.02.2023, Iddawela J, has stated,

However, it is more appropriate to note that corroboration of

evidence is not imperative where there is irrefutable evidence at face

value, provided by the appellant to satisfy the court on a balance of

probability that necessary precautionary measures have been taken

as a reasonable owner of the vehicle to prevent the commission of

offences by using the vehicle.

13. When considering the contents quoted above, it is clear that if

indisputable evidence is provided by an owner to satisfy the Court on a

balance of probability of the precautionary measures taken by him to

prevent the use of the particular vehicle to commit an offence, then

evidence to corroborate the narration of such owner is not essential.

14. The vehicle in issue has been picked up by the driver at about 04.30hrs

on 29.01.2015, the registered owner has got to know about the seizure of

the vehicle at about 06.00hrs on the same day. The vehicle had been

loaded with 14 logs of jack timber, the annexure to the plaint set out the

details of the logs in itself and the logs have been of substantial sizes.

15. The Learned Magistrate in the impugned order has drawn her attention

to facts discussed in the previous paragraph and inferred that the logs

have been loaded onto the vehicle prior to 04.30hrs on that day. She has

made such an inference based on the fact that the logs that were loaded

9

onto the vehicle were of substantial sizes and such logs could not have

been loaded to the vehicle concerned within a short period of 1.5 hrs.

Hence, the appellant had connived with the driver to commit the offence

the driver was convicted of.

16. There is no evidence as regard to the manner in which the logs were

loaded onto the vehicle in issue. Further there is no evidence to eliminate

the possibility of the logs being loaded onto the vehicle in a very short

period of time if it was done mechanically. The Learned Magistrate

therefore has misdirected herself on that point too.

17. The Learned High Court Judge has not given his mind to the facts

discussed in this judgment and thereby misdirected himself to when he

affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate dated 22.02.2017. Hence, we

set aside the orders dated 22.02.2017 and 25.06.2020 of the Learned

Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judges respectively.

We direct that the vehicle bearing Registration No. UP LL 0358 be

released to the appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to

the Magistrate Court of Badulla for compliance.

Application allowed.
