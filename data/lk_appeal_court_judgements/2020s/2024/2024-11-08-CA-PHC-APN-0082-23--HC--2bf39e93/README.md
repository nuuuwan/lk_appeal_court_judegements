amend the 1st charge by including a specific date of offence in the 1st

amended by Act No. 22 of 1995 and Act No 29 of 1998 of the

Penal Code,

2. That, at a time other than the time of commission of the offence

Sexual Abuse on Rampati Dewayalage Sakila Sandeepana

Sandakalum alias Dehiattakandiye Sunanda Thero by inserting

the penis of the Accused in to the mouth of Rampati Dewayalage

Sakila Sandeepana Sandakalum alias Dehiattakandiye Sunanda

Thero, who was below the age of 16 years which is an offence

punishable in terms of Section 365B 2 (b) of the Penal Code

amended by Act No. 22 of 1995 and Act No 29 of 1998 of the

Penal Code.

On 28.09.2022, the indictment was served on the Respondent and the

matter was fixed for Pre-Trial conference on 01.03.2023. At the Pre-trial

conference the defence Counsel took up a preliminary objection

regarding the time period mentioned in the three charges in the

indictment. The basis on which the preliminary objection raised was

that the failure to specify an exact date relating to the charges had

deprived the Respondent of a fair trial as the opportunity of taking up a

defence of alibi in the future was adversely affected by not specifying a

date in the charges. The Petitioner had filled written submission by way

of response to the said preliminary objection.

The Learned High Court Judge by his order dated 23.05.2023,

discharged the Respondent of the 2nd and 3rd charges in the indictment

and directed the prosecution to amend the 1st charges by including a

specific date of offence in the 1st charge.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Learned High Court judge of Ampara

dated 23.05.2023, the Petitioner praying this Court to set aside the said

order and request this Court to substitute with a lawful order

considering following exceptional grounds urged.

1) The Learned High Coury Judge has erred in law by failing to

consider that the period specified in the indictment is in

compliance with sections 165, 166 and 174 of the Code of

CA (PHC)APN 82/23

5 | P a g e

Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 as amended and with the

decided case law of the appellate courts of Sri Lanka.

2) The Learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself in law by

discharging the Accused-Respondent from counts 2 and 3 at the

pre-trial stage depriving the victim of a fair trial.

3) The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by entertaining an

erroneous interpretation of the concept of fair trial by arriving at

the conclusion that unless an exact date is specified in a case of

child abuse, a child victim is not even entitled to have the case

taken up for trial.

4) The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider

that his decision to discharge the Accused Respondent at a Pre -

Trail Conference deprived the opportunity for the prosecution to

act in terms of section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979 based on the evidence of Prosecution witnesses.

5) The decision of the Learned Trial Judge to discharge the Accused

Respondent from counts 2 and 3 of the indictment prior to

consideration of any evidence of the Prosecution was, premature,

unlawful, arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious.

6) The Learned High Court Judge misdirected himself on the

purpose of a Pre- Trial conference as well as on the nature &

extent of powers conferred on the High Court Judge at a Pre-Trial

conference by directing the Prosecution to amend the 1st charge

by inserting a specific date of offence.

The background of the case briefly as follows:

The victim in this case was 13-year-old male child entered into

priesthood (Samanera) attached to the Sri Subhodarama Privena in

Mahawanawella. The Respondent was the Chief Priest of the temple

under whose care the victim was during the period specified in the

indictment. The victim was subjected to a medical check-up and was

diagnosed to be depressed due to continues sexual abuse.

CA (PHC)APN 82/23

The preliminary objection regarding the time frame mentioned in the

indictment was taken up by the Respondent before the trial the trial

proper started. Hence, it is very clear that the said preliminary objection

was taken up by the Respondent at the Pre-Trial Conference.

The Amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure by Act No.22 of

2022 stipulates the procedures relating to holding of Pre-Trial

Conference in Criminal matters. One of the purposes under Section

195A (3) (c) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act is providing an

opportunity to the accused to give advance notice of his mitigatory or

exculpatory defence and that of an alibi as specified in Section 126A of

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

The object of a Pre-Trial Conference is to identify clearly the issues in

dispute so as to facilitate expeditious disposal of cases through proper

case management. Further it provides an opportunity for the defence

and the prosecution to present their case before the Learned High

Court.

Under this context, the Learned High Court is not entitled to direct the

prosecution to effect any amendment to the indictment or discharge

Accused from the case. This is a clear intervention to the prosecutorial

discretion of the Attorney General.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge not only discharged the

Accused from 2nd and 3rd charges, but also directed the prosecution to

amend the 1st charge in the indictment by including a specific date of

the offence in the 1st charge. By doing so, the Larned High Court Judge

switched on to the inquisitorial system where he played an expanded

role.

Section 165 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure states:

The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place

of the alleged offence and as to the person (if any) against whom and

as to the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed as are

CA (PHC)APN 82/23

7 | P a g e

reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with

which he is charged and to show that the offence is not prescribed.

Upon perusal of the above Section nowhere it mentioned that the

prosecution must specify the date of offence in the indictment.

In Director General of Commission to Investigate Allegation of

Bribery or Corruption v. Punchi Banda and another CA (PHC) APN

No. 142/2014 decided on 12.09.2017 the held that:

There is no provision in law which makes it mandatory for the

prosecution to specify a particular date as a date of offence in a

charge. In other wards it is legally permissible for the prosecution to

have a time period, instead of specified date, as the time of offence in

a charge. Of course, such information provided by the prosecution

must be reasonably sufficient to give notice of the matter to the

accused.

In M.G.Premadasa v. The Attorney General CA 261/2009 decided on

26.05.2014, the Court held that:

On the question of vagueness of the incident regarding the date of

the incident and the reference made therein to the period, we cannot

see any prejudice being caused to the accused party, on the aspect

since it was not an incident but the alleged acts had been committed

on several dates, which shows repetition and continuation of acts.

In R v Dossi 13 Cr.App.R.158 the Court held that:

That a date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless

it is essential part of the alleged offence, the defendant may be

convicted although the jury finds that the offence was committed on a

date other than that specified in the indictment. Amendment of the

indictment is unnecessary, although it will be good practice to do so.

Provided that there was a prejudice, where it is clear on the evidence

that if the offence was committed on the day other than that

specified.

CA (PHC)APN 82/23

Section 166 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states:

Any error in stating either the offence or the particulars required

to be stated in the charge and any omission to state the offence or

those particulars shall not be regarded at any stage of the case as

material, unless the accused was misled by such error or

omission.

As the matters discussed above could be decided only during the trial,

directing the prosecution to amend indictment, and discharging the

Respondent from 2nd and 3rd charges are clear misdirection. The

Learned High Court is not empowered to make such direction to the

prosecution during the Pre-Trial stage.

The Petitioner, further submitted that although the Respondent had

raised the defence of alibi during the Pre-Trial Conference, he had not

raised the same at the stage of investigation.

Section 126A (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states:

No person shall be entitled during a trial on indictment in the High

Court, to adduce evidence in support of the defence of an alibi,

unless he has

(a) stated such fact to the police at the time of his making his

statement during the investigation; or

(b) stated such fact at any time during the preliminary inquiry; or

(c) raised such defence, after indictment has been served, with

notice to the Attorney General at any time prior to fourteen days of

the date of commencement of the trial:

Provided however, the Court may, if it is of opinion that the accused

has adduced reasons which are sufficient to show why he delayed to

raise the defence of alibi within the period set out above, permit the

accused at any time thereafter but prior to the conclusion of the

case for the prosecution, to raise the defence of alibi.

CA (PHC)APN 82/23

9 | P a g e

As per the section mentioned above, in this case the Respondent could

adduce evidence in support of the defence of alibi after giving 14 days

notice prior to the date of commencement of the trial.

Hence, it clear that the alibi defence could only be considered during

the trial and not as a preliminary objection at the Pre-Trial stage. The

Learned High Court Judge, failing to take the above legal provision

pertaining to alibi had come to a wrong decision by upholding the

preliminary objection raised at the Pre-trial stage.

Due to above mentioned reasons, I set aside the order dated 23.05.2023

pronounced by the Learned High Court Judge Ampara, discharging the

Respondent from the 2nd and 3rd charge of the indictment. The Learned

High Court Judge is hereby directed to proceed with the trial on the

original indictment containing all the counts, unless Hon. Attorney

General moves to amend the indictment.

Hence, the revision application is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgment to the

High Court of Ampara forthwith for necessary compliance.
