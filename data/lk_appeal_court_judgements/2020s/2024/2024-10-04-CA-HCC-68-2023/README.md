JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General on following charge:

On or about the 12th March 2018 the accused committed the murder of

Herath Mudiyanselage Sandun Prasad alias Ashan which is an offence

punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

As the Appellant opted for a non-jury trial, the trial commenced before a

judge and the prosecution had led seven witnesses and marked production

P1-3 and closed the case. Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that

the evidence presented by the prosecution warrants a case to answer, called

for the defence and explained the rights of the accused.

The Appellant made a dock statement and closed his case.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the Learned High Court after coming to the conclusion that the

prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, convicted the

Appellant as charged and sentence him to death on 07.02.2023. Aggrieved

by the conviction and sentence the Appellant had preferred this appeal in

this Court.

CA/HCC/0068/2023

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the hearing the

Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant preferred following grounds appeal in

support his argument.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has erred in law by deciding that the

prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

2. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by disbelieving the dock

statement of the Appellant in toto.

3. The Appellant was not afforded a fair trial.

Without prejudice to the above grounds of appeal;

4. Has the Learned High Court Judge erred in law by deciding that the

alleged act committed by the Appellant falls under murder when

there is evidence suggesting that the act committed falls under

culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to PW1, Maheswari she is the mother-in-law of the Appellant. The

Appellant got married to her daughter and blessed with two children. Three

months prior to the incident, the Appellants wife had eloped with the

deceased and stayed with the deceased about three months in Elakanda

area. The Appellant somehow brought her back on the day of the incident.

In the evening, the Appellants wife again had eloped with the deceased. The

Appellant had gone in search of his wife and found her going in a three-

wheeler with the deceased and one of her children. At about 8.30pm the

CA/HCC/0068/2023

5 | P a g e

Appellant had come to her house and informed that he caught his wife. When

she ran to the road had seen a green coloured three-wheeler and some people

standing there. She had not seen the Appellant once she came to the place

of the incident. When she tried to held her daughter, somebody had pulled

her by her hair. She had seen her daughter taking the deceased to the

hospital. She had seen the deceased was lying fallen near the three-wheeler.

She had not seen how the deceased sustained injuries.

PW5, Surendran, a three-wheeler driver by profession had gone a hire with

the deceased to the Randiya Uyana Housing Scheme. The deceased had gone

into the housing scheme and brought the wife of the Appellant and a child.

As soon as the deceased and the Appellants wife got into the three-wheeler

the Appellant had come in another three-wheeler and stopped his three-

wheeler and started to fight with his wife. Thereafter, both the Appellant and

the deceased also engaged in a fight. Though this witness tried to separate

them, but he could not. Thereafter he had left the place and came to know

about the death of the deceased on the following day.

PW8, IP/Kadiranga had conducted the investigation, visited the scene, and

visited the Colombo General Hospital. He was informed by the hospital

authority that the deceased had passed away at 22.15 hours on the same

day. As the investigation revealed that the Appellant is the perpetrator,

continued his investigation along with PW9 SI/Udayanga and arrested the

Appellant on 14.03.2018, two days after the incident at Colombo-14.

PW9 had recorded his statement and recovered the blood-stained shirt of the

Appellant upon his statement under Section 27(1) of the Evidence

Ordinance. Although the Government Analyst discovered blood stains on the

shirt, but unable to express an opinion as to the origin due to contamination.

The JMO who held the post mortem examination, had stated that the death

had occurred due to two stab injuries to heart and lungs due to multiple stab

CA/HCC/0068/2023

6 | P a g e

injuries to the chest. The doctor had noted 16 stab wounds on the deceaseds

body.

The investigating team unable to trace the murder weapon in this case.

The Appellant in his dock statement stated that when came home after work

his wife was not at home. On inquiry his mother in-in-law had informed that

her daughter had gone to a nearby boutique. Although he had waited about

45 minutes, he could not find his wife. When he went in search of her, had

seen his wife going in a three-wheeler. Immediately he had stopped the three-

wheeler and pleaded his wife to come with him. When his wife decided to

come with him, the deceased had started to fight with the Appellant. Both

had a fight and when the deceased held the by his collar and assaulted him,

he had pulled deceaseds hand and ran away from the scene.

At the hearing, Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant had

submitted to this court that he will be making submissions only with regard

to the conviction as the conviction under Section 296 of the Penal Code

cannot stand, whereas it should have been considered under Section 297 of

Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight. Hence, he invited this Court only

to consider his 4th ground of appeal only.

Section 297 of the Penal Code states as follows:

Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to twenty years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which

the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing

such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;

or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may

extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with

the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention

CA/HCC/0068/2023

7 | P a g e

to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause

death.

In this case the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defence jointly

revealed that the wife of the Appellant had eloped with the deceased and lived

with him for three months. This incident had happened on the day when the

Appellant brought his wife to his house. Further, a fight started between the

Appellant and the deceased, when the deceased tried to take the wife of the

Appellant second time, particularly the day she returned to the Appellant.

The incident happened when the Appellant prevented his wife going with the

deceased.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the consideration of

lesser culpability would not arise as the defence in this case has not accepted

responsibility in any manner whatsoever for the injuries inflicted on the

deceased.

As there was a fight erupted between the parties over this incident which

had been endorsed by the Learned High Court Judge in his judgment, the

Learned Counsel made his application under Exception 4 to Section 294 of

the Penal Code.

The above-mentioned 4th Exception provides as follows:

Culpable homicide is not murder it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation: - It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the

provocation or commits the first assault.

CA/HCC/0068/2023

8 | P a g e

In the event where the defence of sudden fight has not been taken up on

behalf of the Appellant, and also the injury alleged to have been inflicted on

the Appellant, the Learned High Court Judge should have considered the

evidence which favours the Appellant more meticulously.

In The King v Bellana Vitanage Eddin 41 NLR 345 the court held that:

"In a charge of murder, it is the duty of the judge to put to the jury the

alternative of finding the accused guilty of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder when there is any basis for such a finding in the

evidence on record, although such defence was not raised nor relied

upon by the accused.

In Luvis v. The Queen 56 NLR 442 the court held that:

Having regard to the evidence, the fact that sudden fight was not

specifically raised as a defence did not relieve the trial judge of the duty

of placing before the jury that aspect of the case.

In this case although Learned High Court Judge had come to the conclusion

that the incident had taken place due to a sudden fight, but not awarded the

benefit to the Appellant under exception 4 of the Section 294 of the Penal

Code. This is a clear misdirection which certainly vitiate the conviction for

murder. The failure by the Learned High Court Judge to consider

diminishing responsibility as required by the law has caused great prejudice

to the Appellant.

Considering all the circumstances stressed before this court I conclude that

this is an appropriate case to consider for the Appellants benefit, his

CA/HCC/0068/2023

9 | P a g e

entitlement for a plea of sudden fight under Exception-4 to Section 294 of

the Penal Code.

Therefore, I set aside the sentence imposed on the Appellant and substitute

with a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment. A fine of Rs.5000/- with 06

months default sentence also imposed on the Appellant. As the Appellant is

in prison since the date of conviction by the Learned High Court Judge, I

order the sentence imposed by this Court be operative from 07/02/2023.

Subject to the above variation the appeal is partly allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the

High Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
