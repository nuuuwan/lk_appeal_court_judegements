When the matter came up on 14th March 2024, Court directed to dispose the matter by

way of Written Submissions.

Facts relevant to this application are as follows

The Petitioner who owned two private hospitals in the Ratnapura District under the name

of Arya Hospital has obtained loans from the Bank by mortgaging their property. The said

facility was given in the year of 2014. According to the Petitioner the said facilities have

been renegotiated or rescheduled.

The Petitioner in the paragraph 5 of the petition has stated that due to the Easter Sunday

bombing in 2019 and Covid 19 Pandemic from 2020 and Economic Crisis in 2022 the

operation of the Petitioners Hospital did not progress as expected. Therefore, the

Petitioner has found it difficult to meet their liabilities to the Respondent Bank with

regards to the monthly loan installment payments and have sought to reschedule the loan.

Whilst the negotiation was going on, on or about 13th September 2022 the Respondent

sent a Letter of Demand to the Petitioner. Thereafter, on 30th September 2022 Petitioner

received a covering letter and a copy of resolution passed on 28th of September 2022 by its

Board of Directors to take action under section 4 of the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act

No 4. Of 1990 to sell the Petitioners property by public auction. The said resolution is

marked as P40.

The gravamen of this application is that the Bank has not considered the circular issued

by the circular No 2 of 2022 by the Monterey Board of Central Bank of Sri Lanka which

certain concession have been granted by the Central Bank for Covid 19 which effected

Businesses and individuals.

On the other hand, Respondents in their limited statement of objections dated 05.01.2023

have stated that the petitioner has defaulted making payments from 2016. According to

the Respondent in 2018 and 2020 the Loan was rescheduled on the request of the

Petitioner. These facts are not indicated in the said Petition. As the Petitioner failed to

comply with the rescheduled payments the Respondent has sent Letter of Demand. Since

the Petitioner has failed to make any payment, Respondent has taken steps under the

said Act.

According to the Respondent, Petitioner is a habitual defaulter. According to the

document marked P38 the amount due from the Petitioner as at 30.04.2022 is Rupees

Page 4 of 8

Four Hundred and Ninety One Million Fifty Two Thousand Four Hundred and Fifty

Rupees and Cents One F 491, 05,454 ( Rupees 491,052,454.01).

The main allegation made by the Petitioner is that the Circular No 2 of 2022 issued by

the Monterey Board of Central Bank of Sri Lanka, the Respondent has failed to consider

the concession derived from the said circular.

The Founder of the Arya Hospital (now deceased) has obtained several loan facilities from

the Respondent Bank from 2014. Within 2 years time he has failed to pay the dues.

Thereafter several facilities were given by the bank, by way of rescheduling.

When this Court perused the said circular marked as P41. Central Bank offered the

concession to Businesses and individuals engaged in various economic sectors who were

subjected to the Covid 19 moratoriums. We are mindful, that the said Petitioner has failed

to pay the loan from the year 2016. Thereafter, numerous occasions have been granted to

the petitioner to settle the loan.

Even after he received the Letter of Demand he has not taken steps to settle the loan.

According to the section 10 of the said act there is a provision available to stay the auction.

Section 10

(1) If the amount of the whole of the unpaid portion of the loan, together with interest

payable and of the moneys and costs, if any, recoverable by the Board under section 13 is

tendered to the Board at any time before the date fixed for the sale, the property shall not

be sold, and no further steps shall be taken in pursuance of the resolution under section

4 for the sale of that property.

(2) If the amount of the instalment in respect of which default has been made, and of the

moneys and costs, if any, recoverable by the Board under section 13 is tendered to the

Board at any time before the date fixed for the sale, the Board may in its discretion direct

that the property shall not be sold and that no further steps shall be taken in pursuance

of the substitution under section 4 for the sale of that property.

But the Petitioner has failed to take any steps to prevent the sale. There is no material to

be found to establish that the Petitioner have paid at least the unpaid installment up to

the time this action was filed. This section was referred by Chitrasiri J in DFCC Bank

(PLC) v. Fathima Ruzana Fakurdeen and others., SC Appeal No. 133/2014, decided on

24.03.2016,

Page 5 of 8

Sub section (1) above provides for the borrower to prevent the auction being held provided

he/she tenders to the Board unpaid portion of the loan together with interest and the costs

incurred thereto. Sub section (2) allows the borrower to pay the installment in respect of

which default has been made with the moneys and costs recoverable by the Bank and then

to request the Board to halt the auctioning of the property mortgaged using its discretion

referred to therein. Therefore, it is clear that the borrower should have paid the unpaid

installments if he/she has not paid the entire unpaid amount, in order to move under

Section 10 of the Act No.4 of 1990.

To show that whether the Petitioner has attempted to the concession under the said

circular. Courts attention was drawn on Section 7 (1), 7(2) and 7 (3) of the said circular

which was marked as P41.

7 Transparency of the Concessions

7.1 Eligible Borrowers may request for the above concessions on or before 31 July 2022 in

writing or through electronic means.

7.2 Licensed banks shall make the decision on whether to accept or decline the request

made by the borrower within one month of the receipt of the request and duly inform the

burrower of such decision.

7.3 In the case of a rejection of request, licensed banks shall inform the burrower the

reasons for such rejection and shall advise the burrower by and through the same letter

that there is an opportunity for the borrower to appeal against such rejection to the

Director, Financial Consumer Relations Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

There is no indication that the Petitioner has applied for this concession which was

refused by the Bank. Even it was refused there is a provision available to him to appeal

to Director Financial Consumer Relations Department. Generally Our Courts are

reluctant to issue Certiorari when there is an adequate alternate remedy.

We are mindful of the sentiments expressed by the Justices in the following judgements

with regards to the Recovery of Loans by Banks under the Recovery of Loans by Banks

Act. Samayawardhena J in Bettans Group of Companies (Pvt) Ltd v. Lankaputhra

Development Bank and Others, CA/WRIT 230/2015, Decided on 10.07.2020 held that;

Before I part with this Judgment let me also add the following. The Petitioner cannot

invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court as of right. It is a discretionary relief; an act of

Page 6 of 8

grace on the part of the Court. The fact that the loan was obtained and the Petitioner is

in default is undisputed. By this application, filed more than five years ago, the Petitioner

has prevented the Bank from recovering its dues through parate execution-a quicker and

faster procedure recognised by the law. Banks are not charitable institutions; they are the

cornerstones of economies. It should be understood that similar to the Petitioner being

engaged in a business, granting loans with the expectation of timely repayment is a major

part of the ordinary course of business of a Bank. If a Bank is prevented from taking such

measures as it is entitled in law to take to protect its interests, the economy of the country

would suffer. The Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special Provisions) Act was passed to

assist Banks to fast-track the procedure of debt recovery. There is no place for high-flown

technical objections under this Act.

Amaradasa Liyanage v. Sampath Bank PLC, SC Appeal No:126/2012, Decided on

04.04.2014, Tilakawardane,J held that;

The ambit and purpose of the Recovery of Loans by Banks Act is, in essence, to recover

monies due to the Bank while ensuring that the Bank does not enjoy an unjust

enrichment. The provisions of the Act, by allowing parate execution, is to facilitate the

process of collecting monies due, without lengthy court proceedings, and to do so in a fair

and reasonable manner. This objective should therefore not be hindered by minor

procedural irregularities such as the absence of the signatures of all Board members on

the Certificate of Sale, for such minor irregularities cannot have much impact on the

rights of the borrower.

Minor procedural irregularities cannot, further, be grounds upon which actions may be

instituted for such actions would only amount to the abuse of the process of Court which

must not be allowed. In the present case, monies due remained unpaid for a total of four

years prior to the auction taking place and to challenge the sale of property on the basis

of a minor irregularity in documentation will undoubtedly remain unsuccessful.

The above judgment was referred by Aluwihare J in Upul Chaminda Perera

Kumarasinghe and Another v. Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC, SC Appeal No.

74/2021, Decided on 11.10.2023, held;

The plaintiffs cannot seek the intervention of the court to prevent the Defendant Bank

from lawfully exercising their rights in terms of a valid contract, without making a case

for irreparable and irremediable damage. Courts cannot and should not be treated as the

refuge of all defaulting creditors.

Page 7 of 8

In Zubair v. Bank of Ceylon, 2000 (2) SLR 187 at page 188, Udalagama., J held that;

Before parting with this order it would also be appropriate to mention that in Debt

Recovery matters it would not be correct for courts to hold against the intention of the

Legislature on technicalities.

We are mindful that since the Petitioner has failed to pay the loan facilities which he

obtained in 2014, bank has given ample facilities from 2016 by rescheduling the said loan.

After they extend their said facilities for 3 times, still Petitioner defaulted making

payments. As a result the Letter of Demand was sent. It is clear that the conduct of the

Petitioner as a habitual defaulter that is to say his conduct for not honoring his obligation,

Court will not grant any relief even if he is entitled under the said circular.

Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another, 1996 (2)

SLR 70 at page 73, Jayasuriya, J held that;

I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ of

certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a

matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the court has a discretion to deny

him relief having regard to his conduct; delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction

are all valid impediments which stand against the grant of relief.

The Petitioner did not satisfy this Court that passing of the resolution, the bank has acted

contrary to the circular marked as P41 or have ignored the direction given by the

Monetary Board.

As stated by His Lordship Justice Grero in Desmond Perera and Others v. Karunarathne,

Commissioner of National Housing and Others, (1994) 3 SLR page 316, at pages 329 and

330: As pointed out by the learned President's Counsel for the 3rd respondent, Lord

Diplock in the case of CCSV v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984) UKHL 9, clearly

classified under three heads the grounds on which administrative action could be subject

to control by judicial review. They are:

(i) Illegality;

(ii) Irrationality; and

(iii) Procedural impropriety.

Page 8 of 8

By 'Illegality' as a ground for judicial review, I mean that the decision-maker must

understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give

effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided, in

the event of dispute, by those persons, by judges by whom the judicial power of the state

is exercisable.

Petitioner has failed to satisfy the above said grounds. Therefore, for the above said

reasons I decide to dismiss the application of the Petitioner with Costs.
