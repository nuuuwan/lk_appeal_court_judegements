JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Trafficking and Possession of 3.17 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on

11th March 2015.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colomb imposed life imprisonment on both counts on

20/07/2021.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Learned High Court Judge had not adequately considered the

probability of the story narrated by the prosecution.

2. Learned High Court Judge had shifted the burden on the Appellant to

prove his innocence.

In this case, the raid was conducted with a specific information received. The

raid was headed by PW1 with seven male and one female police officer from

the Colombo Crime Division, Colombo-09. Each of them including the

Government Analyst has been named as witnesses in the indictment. The

prosecution had called PW1, PW3, PW9, and PW14 and marked productions

P1 to P9 in support of their case. The Government Analysts qualifications

were admitted under Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.

15 of 1979.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had made a dock statement and

closed the defence case.

Background of the case.

On 11/03/2015 PW1 IP/Chandana attached to the Colombo Crime Division

had received information from his personal informer that the Appellant was

coming from Seevalipura to Gimhana Restaurant Dematagoda with Heroin.

He had received the information at about 21.10 hours and the raiding party

had left the Colombo Crime Division within five minutes i.e. 21.15 hours and

had come near Gimhana Restaurant and waited in anticipation of arrival of

the Appellant. According to PW1, the informant had given the description of

the Appellant and the dress he was wearing. As per the description, the

Appellant had walked towards the restaurant and was arrested by the police

team headed by PW1. Upon search, a cellophane bag with some substance

was recovered from his right-side trouser pocket. Upon the substances in

CA/HCC/74/22

4 | P a g e

the parcel recovered from the Appellant reacted for Heroin

(diacetylmorphine), he was arrested at 21.55 hours and subjected to further

investigation. As the investigation revealed that his house was situated in

Uswetakeiyawa, the police party had gone to the Appellants house and did

a search but not successful in recovering any illegal substance. On the way

the police party went to the Cargills Food City, Peliyagoda Branch and

weighed the substance which showed 8.120 grams with the envelope used

for temporary safekeeping.

Thereafter, the police party had returned to the station at 23.30 hours,

sealed the production, entered the same under PR No. 22/15 and handed

over the Appellant and the production to PW9 who was the reserve duty

officer at that time.

Thereafter, PW3 was called to give evidence to corroborate the evidence of

PW1 and it followed by the Government Analyst and PW9.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus:

[1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC/74/22

5 | P a g e

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are interrelated, the grounds

will be considered together in this case.

The role of probability is pivotal in persuading the judge on specific points,

as higher probabilities increase the likelihood of the judge being convinced.

Probability plays a crucial role in criminal investigations, aiding in the

evaluation of the relevance of different types of evidence. In order to accuse

someone "beyond reasonable doubt," it is essential to possess substantial

evidence. To achieve this, certain assumptions must be made to draw

conclusions. The likelihood of these assumptions being accurate is precisely

termed the principle of probability in legal contexts.

In this case, police officers had conducted the raid upon the information that

the Appellant was coming to Gimhamna Restaurant from Seevalipura. They

set off from the police station within five minutes of receiving the information.

Prior to leaving the station, PW1 had checked the police team which

consisted about seven male and one female officer. Further, PW1 had said

that he checked the van which was used for the raid.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment, also doubted regarding the

preparation and setting off for raid in five minutes time of the information.

CA/HCC/74/22

But she had used her imaginary explanation in favour of the prosecution.

The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Judges formulate their judgments based on the information presented to

them during court proceedings, including verbal arguments, written

submissions, and supporting documents provided by the parties through

their legal representatives. They meticulously examine the facts presented

and evaluate the evidence that has been entered into the court record.

Ultimately, their decisions are based on an objective analysis of the law and

the evidence presented, rather than subjective personal beliefs. Relying on

personal beliefs would introduce significant bias into the judicial process,

undermining the fairness and impartiality that are fundamental principles

of the legal system.

The police team involved in the raid was not a special team created to combat

drug menace. Hence, considering the time consumed for the preparation of

the raid (five minutes) after receiving information, it is highly improbable to

do such a preparation as described by the prosecution.

As per the information received, the Appellant was supposed to come from

Seevalipura. But after his arrest he was taken to Uswetakeiyawa to check

his house. No action was taken to check his Seevalipura house or conduct

any investigation as per the information received. This too raises serious

doubt regarding the probability of the raid as described by PW1.

CA/HCC/74/22

7 | P a g e

PW1 had not taken prompt action either to do a temporary sealing or

weighing the substance. Immediately after arrest, the Police party had gone

to Uswetakeiyawa, which is a place far away from the place of arrest. On

their return from Uswetakeiyawa, at Peliyagoda, steps had been taken to

weigh the substance from the Peliyagoda Cargills Food City outlet. The gross

amount weighed about 8.120 grams. Weighing such a meagre amount in a

Cargills Food City raises very serious doubts as most of the items sold at the

said supermarket over 250 grams. This also raises a significant doubt on the

precise weight of the heroin.

The Learned High Court Judge in considering the probability test, convinced

that leaving in five minutes time for the raid raises doubt to some extent.

Despite arriving at this conclusion, she failed to grant the benefit to the

Appellant.

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the

prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

In this instance, although the Learned High Court Judge harboured doubts

regarding the probability factors of the case, she nonetheless neglected to

grant the benefit to the Appellant.

CA/HCC/74/22

The burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute.

It is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas probandi

incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: "The necessity of proof always

lies with the person who lays charges."

It is commonly acknowledged that shifting a legal onus onto the accused

with respect to an element of an offence that is essential to culpability is an

encroachment on the presumption of innocence, and more difficult to

justify. Shifting the burden of proof on such an issue involves the possibility

of unfair conviction.

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has argued before the

Supreme Court that a law that reverses the burden of proof on to an accused

person, thereby putting a legal burden on them to disprove an element of an

offence, interferes with their right to a fair trial as protected by the

Constitution.

Sinad Gibney, Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality

Commission stated:

Given its importance to the integrity of the justice system, a reversal of

the burden of proof, particularly in a criminal case where the accused

persons right to liberty is at stake, must always be subject to the

highest tests and exist within the parameters set by the Constitution.

Article 13(3) of our Constitution enshrines the concept fair trial. The Article

states:

Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard, in

person or by an Attorney-at-Law, at a fair trial by a competent court.

To determine whether you are innocent or guilty, the concept of fair trial

plays a vital role. A fair trial is a universally recognised human right. Fair

CA/HCC/74/22

9 | P a g e

trials help establish the truth and are vital for everyone involved in a case. It

is a cornerstone of democracy, helping to ensure fair and just societies.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge in her judgment at pages 15 and

17 (pages 216 and 218 of the brief) stated as follows:

These portions of the judgment clearly demonstrate that the Appellant had

not afforded a fair trial.

In this case the raid was conducted on an information received. Further,

recovery and weighing the production has failed to pass the probability test

in this case. If the Learned Trial Judge had examined the evidence presented

from the correct perspective, she would have been inclined to accept the

testimony provided by the Appellant.

Further, the Appellant was not afforded a fair trial as guaranteed in the

Constitution.

CA/HCC/74/22

10 | P a g e

Guided by the above cited judicial decisions, I conclude that the appeal

grounds advanced by the Appellant has a very serious impact on the

prosecution case.

As the prosecution had failed in its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 20/07/2021 on the Appellant. Therefore, he

is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
