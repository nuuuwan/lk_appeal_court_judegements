All that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have done is to have made a bare statement that a writ cannot lie since the issue whether the 1st Petitioner is a welfare organization or not is a disputed fact. It must be stressed by this Court that mere denial of a fact by a party or a mere statement that a fact is a disputed fact would not be sufficient to push such a fact under the umbrella of disputed facts. If this Court is to consider such mere denial to be sufficient, this Court would be compelled to refuse the issuance of writs whenever any such statement in the form of 'I deny,' 'I am unaware,' 'I place the burden on the other party to prove,'",

All that the 1st and 2nd Respondents have done is to have made a bare statement that a writ cannot lie since the issue whether the 1st Petitioner is a welfare organization or not is a disputed fact. Another significant observation that this Court could make with regard to the liability of the 1st Petitioner to contribute to EPF is that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents at no time had even attempted to state that the Petitioner is a commercial organization. The material available in this case points strongly to the opposite of it. Thus, the irresistible conclusion that this Court could arrive at from the above material is that the Petitioners are not liable to contribute to EPF in respect of the services of the 3rd Respondent, as the 3rd Respondent has not been engaged in a covered employment within the meaning of the EPF Act.",
