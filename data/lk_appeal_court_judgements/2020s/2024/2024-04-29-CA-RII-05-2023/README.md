The substituted defendant petitioner says in her written submissions from

paragraph 12 onwards as follows,

12. Prior to 27/08/2020. which was the date fixed for the pre-trial, the

Defendant died on 13/08/2020 [157,159]. Until then and also thereafter

the Substituted Defendant was not made aware of the disputes in this

action and her instructions to her attorney at law was to ensure that the

buildings (boutique and living unit) which were being occupied by her and

her daughter will not be affected by the decision in this action and that

they be entitled to use the boutique and the living unit as they had been

doing until then. On the death of the Defendant his rights and title

devolved on his wife the Substituted Defendant and their only child,

Lihinika Sayuri, a 27 year old unmarried girl.

13. Prior to his death the Defendant had nominated his wife, to be

substituted in his room in the event of his death pending the action [164].

Accordingly, on 10/08/2021 order was made substituting the Defendant's

wife as the Substituted Defendant, who is named above as the Substituted

Defendant in the caption of this action. Accordingly, amended caption

dated 10/12/2021 [21] was filed by the Plaintiff.

14. The Substituted Defendant does not appear to have appointed by a

proxy Ms. Uthpala Adhikari, Attorney at law to appear for her (although

the Substituted Defendant has subsequently purported to revoke [168]a

proxy assumed to have been granted by her to Ms. Uthpala Adhikari,

Attorney at law). Therefore, it appears that when the terms of settlement

were recorded in court (as averred below) there was no attorney at law on

record for the Substituted Defendant.

15. Thereafter the pre-trial proceeding was held and concluded on

12/10/2021 [63] at which the admissions and issues which had been

suggested by the Plaintiff and by the defendant were accepted by the court

The trial was accordingly fixed tor 29.11.2021.

4 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

16. On 29/11/2021 when the case was taken up for trial, no proceedings

had been recorded. The journal entry of the said date [13] is difficult to

decipher, except that it appears that on the basis of a possibility of a

settlement of this action the Court refixed the trial for 02.03.2022. No

indication of the basis or of terms of settlement were disclosed or recorded.

17. On the day previous to 02/03/2022 the Substituted Defendant

received a telephone call from Ms. Uthpala Adhikari, Attorney at law, who

stated to the Substituted Defendant that her presence in court on

02/03/2022 was necessary as the case will be settled and that the terms

of settlement will be favourable to the Substituted Defendant. The

Substituted Defendant told the said Attorney at law that the settlement

should be to the effect that by the settlement the residing building and

boutique of the Substituted Defendant should remain for her and her

daughter. The said Attorney at law assured the Substituted Defendant that

by the settlement there would be no change to her residing property which

will remain for her and her daughter.

18. When the Substituted Defendant went to court on 02/03/2022, the

Plaintiff was also present. The Substituted Defendant was not made aware

at any time of any terms of settlement. No written terms of settlement were

made available at any stage to the Substituted Defendant for her to

consider the same with her attorney at law and to receive an explanation

thereof and to understand the implications thereof. She had no such

opportunity. She was not given any document which contained any terms

of settlement. She was not shown or given any survey plans. She was not

aware of the contents of survey plans relevant to this action. She was not

told by Ms. Uthpala Adhikari, Attorney at law, or any one else as to what

the settlement of the case was, or how it would benefit the Substituted

Defendant. When the case was taken up in court Ms. Uthpala Adhikari,

Atorney at law, was present in Court and there were several other lawyers

5 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

also in the Court. A request was made to the Legal Aid Commission that

an affidavit from Ms. Uthpala Adhikari be made available to the Petitioner

in order to file the same in these proceedings in Your Lordships' Court in

order to disclose to Your Lordships' Court the above facts of this case. The

Petitioner has been unable to obtain such an affidavit.

19. In this case a lawyer on 02/03/2022 dictated in court terms of

settlement which were heard by the Substituted Defendant for the first

time. The Substituted Defendant did not understand the said terms and

no one explained them to her. The Substituted Defendant could not and

did not understand how the terms of settlement related to the land and

building which she, her late husband, and their daughter had been

occupying or how their residing building and boutique would remain for

them. The Substituted Defendant heard the said lawyer referring to some

survey plans, and what was dictated by the lawyer was recorded by the

stenographer of the Court. but what was so dictated and recorded was not

explained to or understood by, the Substituted Defendant. As certain

plans were referred to in what was so dictated, the Substituted Defendant

was unable to follow, or understand the implications of what was dictated

and recorded. Thereafter as the Substituted Defendant was instructed by

Ms. Uthpala Atapattu Attorney at law, to sign the record, she did so [14]

after the Plaintiff also placed his signature on the record. The Substituted

Defendant sighned the record because Ms. Uthpala Adhikari, Attorney at

law, had assured her that her residing house and her boutique will remain

unaffected to her and her daughter. After the Substituted Defendant had

signed the record Ms. Uthpala Adhikari Attorney at law, informed the

Substituted Defendant that the case was over and that the court had

entered judgment in terms of the terms of settlement which were recorded.

20. Thereafter, after a few days the Substituted Defendant learnt from

certain known persons who came to the boutique, including a brother of

6 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

the Plaintiff and of the deceased Defendant, that the Plaintiff had been

telling others that he was happy with the settlement of the action because

the Substituted Defendant had settled the action on terms favourable to

the Plaintiff, and that Plaintiff had trapped the Substituted Defendant to

a settlement which was in the Plaintiff's favour. The said known persons

and the said brother have refused to give any affidavit saying that they

wished to keep their good relations with both parties to this action.

21. Thereafter the Substituted Defendant attempted to verify from the

Legal Aid Commission what exactly had been the settlement for which the

Defendant Petitioner had on advice placed her signature on the record.

However, she got no proper response, except that the Legal Aid

Commission obtained from court and handed over to the Substituted

Defendant a certified copy of the terms of settlement which had been

recorded in court on 02/03/2022.

Thereafter the Substituted Defendant consulted another attorney at law,

by the name of Mr. Chamara Nanayaklkarawasam, and his junior, to verify

what had actually happened in the settlement. The said certified copy is

filed herewith marked "E". The cash receipt for payment made by the Legal

Aid Commission to court for the same is filed herewith marked F". It was

explained to the Substituted Defendant by the said attorneys at law that

the terms of settlement which had been recorded in this case referred to

several survey plans and provided for the conveyance by deed of certain

blocks of land depicted in those plans, including the admission by the

Substituted Defendant and by the Plaintiff regarding the ownership of

certain blocks of land shown in the said survey plans, and that there was

no term of settlement to the effect that the Substituted Defendant will

continue to possess her residing premises and boutique of which she and

her daughter were in fact in possession.

22. Thereafter the Substituted Defendant on legal advice changed her (said

supposed) instructing attorney at law and made an application to the

District Court in this action by way of a petition dated 10/06/2022 [38]

and supporting affidavit [44], invoking the provisions of section 839 of the

Civil Procedure Code, praying that the terms of settlement recorded on

02/03/2022 be vacated and set aside, for a direction that fresh terms of

settlement be entered by which the Substituted Defendant as well as the

Plaintiff will be entitled to continue to possess the respective premises of

which they were already in actual possession of.

She then says that the district court had made order on 02.02.2022 dismissing

her application with costs.

The following are some excerpts from the written submissions of the plaintiff

respondent.

15. The Petitioner in her Petition has taken up a position that the 2nd

and 3rd terms of settlement referred to lands outside the scope of this

action and which do not part of corpus of the action and the court acted

without Jurisdiction and in violation of section 408 of the Civil procedure

code but it is total misrepresentation of facts because the Plaintiff and the

Defendant in their Plaint and answer very clearly claiming titles for the

properties described in in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd averments of the settlement

and those portion of Lands are well described in the 2nd and 3rd

Schedules of the Both Plaint and the answer.

16. It is also respectfully submitted that Defendant has taken up that

these was no Compliance with the section 408 of the Civil Procedure code.

17. It is respectfully submitted the section 408 is very clear "such

Agreement compromise on satisfaction shall be notified to the court by

motion made in presence of or on notice to all the parties concerned, and

8 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

court shall passed a decree in accordance there with so far as it relates to

the action, and such decree will be final"

It his case the terms of settlement were read in open court before counsels

and also the Plaintiff and the Defendant and were asked to sign it before

the additional District Judge

18. The Order of the learned additional District Judge dated 02/02/2023

at page (69, 70, 71, 72) was not challenged up to now by the parties in the

Civil High Court of Colombo by way of revision.

19. The Defendant Appellant by passing the available remedy of revision

and or leave to Appeal to the Civil High Court of Colombo and had made

this application, The Restitution in- intergrum and in the alternative for

revision.

[The language in the above excerpt is as one finds in that written

submission. Civil High Court means the Commercial High Court. Since

this case is not a one that is within the scope of that court, it could be

presumed, that, the reference is to the Civil Appellate High Court (in

colloquial terms) which in reality is the Provincial High Court that

exercises civil appellate jurisdiction].

The question is whether to set aside the settlement or not.

The following is relevant,

In Malani Vs. Somapala 2000 (2) SLR 196, it was decided that, "when

settlements or compromises are made as a precaution the of the settlement

or compromise or adjustment should be explained to the parties and their

signatures or thumb impressions should be obtained",

In Lameer vs. Senarathne 1995 (2) SLR 13, it was held that, Where

an Attorney at Law is given a general authority to settle or

compromise a case, [a] client cannot seek to set aside a settlement

9 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

to entered, more so when the client himself had signed the record.

Court cannot grant relief by way of restitution to a party who has

agreed in court to sell property at a lesser price with the full

knowledge of [its] true value". (paragraph 07)

There is nothing to suggest in this case, that, the Attorney at Law was given a

general authority to settle.

Hence the ratio, if there is any, in Lameers case cannot be employed in this case

in toto. Furthermore, I do not, with respect, agree that, once general authority is

given to an Attorney at Law that amounts to the crossing of the Rubicon (cannot

return to original position). That is, with respect, a decision for convenience

of policy but not for the dispensation of principled justice; and for the

convenience of the ruler, not for the ruled, on whose sovereignty the former

stands.

Such unalloyed justice and common sense were recognized by His Lordship

Justice N. E. Weerasooriya2 Judge of the Supreme Court of Ceylon in UKKU

AMMA, Appellant, and PARAMANATHAN et al, Respondents S. C. 34-G. R.

Matale, 13077 decided on 27.11.1959 as Single Judge. (63 NLR 306)

It was decided that

Compromise of action-Procedure-Civil Procedure Code, ss. 91, 408.

Where, in a purported settlement of a case, not only were the provisions of

sections 408 and 91 of the Civil Procedure Code as to notification to Court

by motion not complied with, but there was nothing on the record to show

at whose instance the settlement was arrived at-

Held, that the decree entered in terms of the settlement should be

vacated.

2 Whose brilliance as a lawyer was on unsurpassable excellence.

10 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

Section 408 says,

408. If an action be adjusted wholly or part by any lawful agreement or

compromise, or if the defendant satisfy the plaintiff in respect to the whole

or any part of the matter of the action, such agreement, compromise, or

satisfaction shall be notified to the court by motion made in presence

of, or on notice to, all the parties concerned, and the court shall pass

a decree in accordance therewith, so far as it relates to the action, and

such decree shall be final, so far as relates to so much of the subject-

matter of the action as is dealt with by the agreement, compromise, or

satisfaction.

This shows, that, as per the law enacted by the parliament, which is the supreme

law of the land next to the very Constitution, which the courts cannot deny to

apply, settlements and compromises cannot be entered without following the pre

requisites laid out by written law. If a compromise is entered without following

those pre requisites, it will be valid, as long as one of the parties to it complains

within a reasonable time.

In addition, Justice Weerasooriya said that the record must show, that, at whose

instance the settlement was arrived at.

Section 91 says,

91. Every application made to the court in the course of an action,

incidental thereto, and not a step in the regular procedure, shall be

made by motion by the applicant in person or his counsel or

registered attorney, and a memorandum in writing of such motion shall

be at the same time delivered to the court.

Section 408 is not a step in the regular procedure of plaint, answer, replication,

issues, evidence, judgment and decree.

Hence the requirement of adhering to the provisions of section 91 as well.

11 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

Justice Weerasoorya said in the conclusion, that,

Section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code provides that an agreement or

compromise shall be notified to Court by motion. Under section 91, where

the motion is by the advocate or proctor for a party, a memorandum in

writing of such motion is required to be at the same time delivered to

Court. Not only have these provisions not been complied with, but there is

nothing in the record to show at whose instance the settlement was arrived

at.

In these circumstances I would allow the appeal of the plaintiff with costs.

The decree entered in terms of the settlement is vacated and the case will

be sent back for the trial to be proceeded with according to law. All costs

so far incurred in the Court below will be costs in the cause. This order

will not, however, preclude the parties from arriving at any lawful

adjustment or compromise of the action, if they so desire, and notifying

the same to Court in terms of section 408 of the Civil Procedure Code.

Then I find, that, in W.R. PERERA VS SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY C.A.

(restitutio in integrum) Application No. CA/Rl[I]/01/2019 DC (Tangalle)

[Tangalla] Case No. SPL 251/18, which was decided on 04.03.2021 by my

esteemed colleague and brother Justice C. P. Kirthisinghe (in which I concurred),

the complaint of the plaintiff petitioner was, that, he agreed for the 1st condition,

but not to the 2nd. True, that, in addition the petitioner was blind. But the

decision of this Court was not based on that, or at least on that alone. Blind I

think means cannot see. When the judge is having the record, usually a

stenographer is recording and even if the lawyers of parties may be having a

motion in writing (there is nothing to show that such a motion was there in this

case a requirement under sections 408 and 91) can the party see, even if there

is no problem with his eye sight? In fact, as this Court sees it, that is the basis

for the requirement in section 408 that there must be a written motion and a

memorandum, or at least one of the reasons for that requirement.

12 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

As I see there is no such motion and or memorandum in the copy of the case

record attached to the petition.

In the case decided by Justice Kirthisinghe he said as follows, [Beginning of the

Quotation]

The Petitioner states that the Respondents were aware that the Attorney - at -

Law for the Petitioner was making a mistake as that additional condition was not

a part of the agreement reached by the parties.

In the case of Cornelius Perera vs. Leo Perera 62 NLR 413, Basnayake CJ held that

on the ground of mistake, a consent order and the judgement based on it can be

set aside. Sansoni J held that the proper remedy is by way of an application for

restitutio in integrum. In the case of Halib AbdulCader Ameer vs. Danny Perera

1998 (2) SLR 321, G.P.S. De Silva CJ held that . restitutio in integrum can be

claimed on the ground of "Justus error" which constitutes reasonable or excusable

error..

The Petitioner has taken up the position that the settlement pertaining to the

additional condition recorded is not in compliance with the provisions of the

section 408 of the civil procedure code.

Section 408 of the civil procedure code reads as follows;

408. If an action be adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or

compromise, or if the defendant satisfy the plaintiff in respect to the whole

or any part of the matter of the action, such agreement, compromise, or

satisfaction shall be notified to the court by motion made in presence of, or

on notice to, all the parties concerned, and the court shall pass a decree in

accordance therewith, so far as it relates to the action, and such decree shall

be final, so far as relates to so much of the subject matter of the action as is

dealt with by the agreement, compromise, or satisfaction.

Section 91 of the civil procedure code reads as follows;

13 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

91. Every application made to the court in the course of an action, incidental

thereto, and not a step in the regular procedure, shall be made by motion by

the applicant in person or his advocate or proctor, and a memorandum in

writing of such motion shall be at the same time delivered to the court.

Section 408 of the civil procedure code requires the parties to notify the agreement,

or compromise to court by motion and section 91 of the code requires that a

memorandum in writing of every motion should be delivered to court at the time

it is made. The procedure adopted in this case in the District Court at the time the

settlement was recorded does not satisfy the requirements of section 408.

That shows that the written terms of settlement were not before court at the time

the settlement was recorded and the parties had not tendered to court a

memorandum in writing containing the terms of settlement. Therefore even if the

consent given by the counsel for the Plaintiff Petitioner to include the disputed

additional condition into the terms of settlement had not been vitiated by a mistake

of fact the consent decree entered in terms of that arrangement will not attract the

finality given to the decree passed under section 408 of the code. As stated by

Basnayake CJ in Cornelius Perera vs Leo Perera 62 NLR 413 "Where a statute

provides special machinery which if resorted to renders a decree final, the finality

prescribed in the Act does not attach to a decree unless there is a clear

manifestation of a conscious intension of the parties to resort to that machinery

with a knowledge of the consequences it involves and there has been a strict

compliance with the requirements of the statute." Parties to this case had not

complied with the imperative requirements of section 408 of the civil

procedure code and therefore the consent decree entered in the

District Court will not attract the finality given to decrees passed under

the section 408 of the civil procedure code. Therefore this settlement

can be set aside on that ground alone.

The Roman Dutch Law enables a person to avoid an agreement or settlement for

mistake on his part when the mistake is an essential and reasonable one. In the

case of Cornelius Perera vs Leo Perera cited above Sansoni J states thus "it must

14 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

be essential in the sense that there was a mistake as to the person with whom he

was dealing (error in persona) or as to the nature or subject matter of the

transaction (error in neqotio, error in corpore). A mistake is regard to incidental

matters is not enough. The test of reasonableness is satisfied if the person shows

either (1) that the error was induced by the fraudulent or innocent

misrepresentation of the other party, or (2) that the other party knew, or a

reasonable person should have known, that a mistake was being made, or (3) that

the mistake was, in all the circumstances, excusable (Justus et probabilis error)

even where there was absence of misrepresentation or knowledge on the part of

the other party. An agreement entered into in the course of an action, like any other

agreement, may be set aside on these grounds".

In this case the mistake committed is an essential one as it relates to the nature or

subject matter of the settlement. Before coming to the test of reasonableness it is

appropriate to take into consideration the following opinion expressed by Burnside

CJ in the case of Phillippu vs Ferdinands(1892 (1) Matara cases 207). "And I should

hold that any admission which might be made for the defendants attempting to

bind them to their manifest prejudice in the very essence of the defence on their

pleadings and contrary to their contention on their evidence would not bind them

without shewing that they had expressly authorized their counsel to make it and

with a full knowledge of its effect". [End of Quotation]

Hence what His Lordship Justice Kirthisinghe said; and which I quoted above,

was in perfect accord with the decision of Justice N. E. Weerasooriya in 1959,

although His Lordship himself in W.R. PERERA VS SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL

SOCIETY did not refer to the same. I now even more agree with my former brother

Kirthisinghe, on what I have quoted above from His Lordships judgment, having

read the opinion of Justice Weerasooriya.

The above is the first ground to set aside the purported settlement.

The other ground due to which the purported settlement cannot stand:

The second is as follows,

15 | C . A . R I I 0 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

Adam Smith had said that,

Man is an animal that makes bargains; no other animal does this no

dog exchanges bones with another.

Frederick Bastiat, the French economist and a prominent member of French

Liberal School said, that, the need to consult and compare is a basic facet of

human intellect3 and justice. He denounced, in his 1850 work The Law, the

law which is a negative force (the accumulated force of the collective self defense)

becoming a positive force, attempting to organize justice, in the process

destroying it. The ability of the human mind to compare two or more things while

gauging the quantity or quality of one thing, against another, which is the basis

of the concept of equality, which faculty, the animals does not seem to have in

them, at least to the extent humans have it, is the basis of equality and justice.

There was no reason for the petitioner to agree to a settlement or a compromise

without a clause that enables her with her daughter to remain in what she is in

possession.

She has been misled by her purported registered attorney. It could be argued

that this statement has been made without hearing her and hence not valid. But

she has avoided the opportunity afforded her to explain by giving an affidavit.

Hence I must say what Justice Weerasooriya said in the above case with slight

modification.

I would allow the appeal of the [defendant petitioner] with costs. The decree

entered in terms of the [purported] settlement is vacated and the case [is] sent

back for the trial to be proceeded with according to law. [The petitioner is entitled

to] [a]ll costs so far incurred in [this Court and the Courts] below. This order will

not, however, preclude the parties from arriving at any lawful adjustment or

compromise of the action, if they so desire, and notifying the same to Court in
