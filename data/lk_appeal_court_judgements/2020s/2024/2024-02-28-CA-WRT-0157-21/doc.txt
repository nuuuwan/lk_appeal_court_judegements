The Petitioner in this Application is seeking Orders, inter alia, in the nature

of Writ of Mandamus compelling the Respondents to give or issue a breakdown

or the basis for the computation of the estimates in the letter dated

20.02.2020 marked P7; a Writ of Certiorari quashing the estimate in the said

letter; and/or a Writ of Mandamus compelling the Respondents to reissue the

estimate in compliance with Standard Construction Cost stipulated by the

1st Respondent (Ceylon Electricity Board) and the Statement on the Rights

and Obligations of the Electricity Consumers marked P8 published by the

Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL).

The Petitioner is a company involved in the business of developing of housing

property including blocking out and sale of property and has been registered

for the said purpose within the administrative limits of the North Western

Province as per its Certificate of Annual Registration by-law on the

development of housing property and sale of blocked out lands within the area

of authority of Pradeshiya Sabha' (marked P2, P3, and P3a). In this

background, the Petitioner had acquired the divided parts of the land

"Keethale Watta (Diyaheda Watta) by way of Deeds of Transfer (marked P4(a)

to P4(d)) for the purpose of blocking out and selling the same. Upon a duly

submitted Application to the Pradeshiya Sabha of Naththandiya, the approval

had been granted to the Petitioner for sub dividing the land (Blocking out

Plans) on 31.08.2017 (marked P5(a) to P5(c)). Thereafter, in terms of the said

by-law (marked P3), as required under Clause 09.5 of P3(a), the Petitioner

had taken steps to arrange for the supply of three phase electricity to all

roadways of the blocks described herein.

Following the dealing regarding the application for electricity in 2016, on

13.05.2019 the Petitioner has paid the due fees and applied (marked 'P6') to

obtain electricity from CEB, the 1st Respondent CEB. Following this, on

20.02.2020 the 5th Respondent issued an estimate to supply electricity for the

subject property at a total cost of Rs. 5,460,983.00, and that the estimate has

been prepared based on the Standard Construction Cost relating to 2019

(marked 'P7'). However, there had been no breakdown for the said estimated

cost that the Petitioner had to incur for obtaining a new connection for

electricity.

In this context, the Petitioner has then obtained another estimate (marked

'P9') by another service provider in the field identified through their

electrician, Randika Sevakaru (Private) Limited, the Added 9th Respondent. It

is submitted that through such assessment it has been identified that the

aforesaid estimate marked 'P7' is excessive and/or contrary to the 'Standard

Construction Cost - 2019' (marked 'P10'). The statement (marked P26) as

prepared by the said 9th Respondent in relation to the Estimate P7 based on

the Standard Construction Cost (marked P10), Allowed Charges for 2019

marked P21(c) and the Catalogue & Price List of Materials 2019 (marked

P22) stipulates that the actual cost incurred is approximately Rs

3,798,310.00, as opposed to the sum of Rs. 5,460,983.00 estimated by the

CEB.

The Petitioner, thereafter, through various communication including a letter

of demand and a right to information (RTI) request, had requested the 1st

Respondent (Letters marked 'P11', 'P12', 'P13', 'P14') to reconsider the

estimate given and provide a breakdown or the basis for the computation of

the estimate for which the Petitioner had been informed that the documents

used for the calculation are the 'Standard Construction Cost - 2019' and the

'Goods and Price List - 2019'. The RTI response had then been appealed to

the Respondents as well (marked P17, P18, P18(a)). However, it is evident

that all information furnished by the Respondents had neither disclosed the

Page 5 of 8

elaborate basis of the calculation nor given the Petitioner the breakdown of

the cost associated with the supply of electricity requested

It is also submitted by the Petitioner that similar situations relating to

assessments have been experienced by other consumers/applicants of new

connections which have subsequently revised been revised (marked 'P15').

The Petitioner also submits that there is a document identified as

Investigation Report' which had been issued for selected developers and

projects by Respondents for the purpose of computation of estimates which

provides a detailed breakdown/basis for the estimates.

It is noted that in the aforesaid setting after the institution of this action, the

Petitioner had on 17.02.2021 paid the CEB the said estimated sum, and work

relating to the supply of electricity has commenced on 17.03.2021.

The Respondents are of the view that the Petitioner is not a direct customer

and that there is no corresponding duty owed by the Respondents towards

the Petitioner to provide a breakdown.

This Court is entreated by the Petitioner to explore the conduct of the 1st

Respondent CEB, on the issue of whether relevant information had been

provided as established by law and whether the estimate/cost thereto is

legitimate and in line with the established law and regulations.

In this regard, attention of Court is drawn to the Statement by the Public

Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) made under Section 3(1)(e) of the

Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009 titled "the Rights and Obligations of

the Electricity Consumers" (marked P8). Clause A. 8. of Part II states as

follows:

Consumers have a right to know the breakdown (including the basis

of calculation), of the payments and any security deposit that are

required to be paid to the service provider to obtain a new electricity

supply

Page 6 of 8

As the Petitioner had duly applied and paid for supply for electricity, the

Petitioner is deemed a consumer and therefore had a legitimate expectation

to receive the breakdown including the basis for calculation of the payments

and any security deposit that are required to be paid as provided above. It is

prima facie evident that the Respondents were duty bound to supply the

required information. As the assessment produced analysing the actual costs

based on the relevant documentation, resulting with a variation/difference of

Rs. 1,662,675.00 to the estimate provided by the CEB as the Respondent, the

accuracy of such estimate produced by the Respondents is questionable and

clearly unreliable. It is also noted that the Respondents have been

inconsistent and selective with whom they share the related information.

This Court is of the view that the Respondents position that the Petitioner is

not a direct customer and that there is no corresponding duty owed by the

Respondents towards the Petitioner to provide a breakdown of estimate holds

no merit whatsoever.

In Wickremasinghe and Another v. The Urban Development Authority1

C. N. JAYASINGHE, J. observed as follows:

"Legitimate expectation is pivoted on fairness and reasonableness; as

long as these two components coexist there can and always will be

legitimate expectation.""

"A public authority has a duty to act with fairness and consistency in

dealing with the public and if it makes inconsistent decisions unfairly

and unjustly, it misuses its powers.""

In the obiter dictum of the case Ginigathgala Mohandiramlage Nimalsiri

1 (2002 (3) SLR 253),

Page 7 of 8

Vs. Colonel P.P.J. Fernando and others2 Justice Priyantha Jayawardena

views legitinate expectation as follows;

"The doctrine of legitimate expectation applies to situations to protect

legitimate expectation I arisesfromestablishinganexpeciationbelievingan

undertaking or promise given by a public official or establishing an

expectation taking into consideration ofestablishedpractices of an

authority. However, the said criteria should not be considered as an

exhaustive list as the doctrine of legitimate expectation has a potential to

develop further. Legitimate expectation can be either based on procedural

propriety or on substantive protection Procedural expectations are

protected by requiring that the promised procedure be followed save in

very exceptional circumstances, for instanc: where national securityy

warrants a departure from the expected procedure. However, in such

instances the decision-maker must take into account all relevant

considerations."

Therefore, it is established that the Petitioner has a right for the breakdown

of the estimate costs and The Respondents being under a statutory duty to

issue the breakdown to its consumers have acted inconsistently and

arbitrarily for denying the Petitioner of its legitimate expectations. The

Respondents have failed to adduce reasons for such conduct.

In the aforesaid circumstances this Court is obliged to grant a Writ of

Mandamus compelling the Respondents to give/issue a breakdown or the

basis for the computation of the estimates; a Writ of Mandamus compelling

the Respondents to give a breakdown or the basis for the computation of the

estimate in the letter marked P7; A Writ of Certiorari quashing the estimate

in letter dated 20.02.2020 marked P7 and a Writ of Mandamus compelling

the Respondents to reissue the estimate in compliance with Standard

Construction Cost and the Statement on the Rights and Obligations of the
