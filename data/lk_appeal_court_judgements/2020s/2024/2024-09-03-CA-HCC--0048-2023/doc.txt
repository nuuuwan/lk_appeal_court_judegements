JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter after referred as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General before the High Court of

Hambantota for committing an offence under section 364(1) of the Penal

Code on Liyana Waduge Piyasili on or about the 10th of July 2012.

After a non-Jury trial, the Appellant was convicted as charged and was

sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10000/-

with a default sentence of 01-year of rigorous imprisonment had been

imposed. In addition, Rs.125000/- was imposed as compensation payable to

the victim with a default sentence of 01-year rigorous imprisonment

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the hearing he was

connected via Zoom from prison.

On behalf of the Appellant following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. The learned trial Judge has failed to consider that the story of the

prosecutrix has been contradicted by medical evidence.

CA/HCC/0048/2023

3 | P a g e

2. The learned Trial Judge has failed to take into consideration that the

prosecutrix is not a credible witness and it is unsafe to act upon the

evidence owing to numerous inter se and per se contradictions that go

to the very root of the prosecution case.

The prosecutrix in this case was 53 years old, married with three children

and a grandmother at the time of the incident. On the date of the incident,

she had gone to a nearby canal around 1.00 p.m. to have a bath. When she

returned home afterwards, an unknown person had held her neck after

closing her mouth, dragged her, pushed her on to the ground and raped her

forcibly. Before he could have sexual intercourse, he had sucked her breast.

After the intercourse he had demanded her to suck his penis, threatening

her with a knife. After committing rape, the person had left the place in a

motor bike. PW1 had been able to note down the motor bike number. After

returning home, she had gone to the police with her grandson. On their way,

she had seen the person who committed the crime passing them in the same

motor bike. With the help of PW2, Nandasena and her grandson the said

person was caught and detained at the residence of one Soma until he was

handed over to the police. She identified the Appellant at the trial as the

person who committed the offence.

The victim was examined by PW3, JMO Ambepitiya at the Hambantota

Hospital and gave evidence at the trial.

When the defence was called the Appellant gave evidence from witness box

and took up the defence of consent.

In a criminal trial the judge has to rely on the knowledge and opinion of

certain experts to appreciate the technical details involved in a particular

case. Evidence is given by the expert of the relevant field in the form of his

opinion which is based on the information that he gathered from the facts of

the case. This evidence supplements the assertions of the judge and together,

they complement each other and combine to form the basis of the judgment.

CA/HCC/0048/2023

However, the evidentiary value of the opinion given by the expert is not the

judgment. However, the evidentiary of the opinion given by the expert is not

unshakeable because of the discretionary power in the hand of court, which

may choose to accept it or reject it.

Medical examination of the victim always plays a very important role in a

case of rape. As there is usually no eye witness of the fact, and the victim

usually say in her interest only, the medical evidence is one of the ways

which can help to find out the true fact. As such, medical examination of the

victim had always been a mandatory. The medical examination of the

Accused equally too plays a vital role in a rape case.

In the case of the State of Karnataka v S.Raju (2007) 11 SCC 490 the court

held that:

In the case of absence of medical evidence, rape accused can be

convicted. Therefore, the corroboration with medical reports is not

necessary in every case.

In the State of MP v Dayal Sahu (2005) 8 SCC 122 the court held that:

An appellate court shall not reverse the findings of guilt on the basis of

irrelevant circumstances. Where the evidence of victim and other witness

was found reliable, accused shall not get the benefit of doubt for non-

examination of doctor of the victim.

The second explanation to Section 363 of the Penal Code as amended states:

Evidence of resistance such as injuries to the body is not essential to

prove that sexual intercourse took place without consent

In this case, although the victim said that she fell onto a thorn bush and due

to this act, there were abrasions caused to her legs and her back. But the

CA/HCC/0048/2023

5 | P a g e

JMO had not noted any injuries on her legs or back. When PW1 was

confronted of this contradiction with the evidence of PW3, the JMO, victim

had stated that the thorn bush that the Accused made her fall onto was a

dead/rotten thorn bush.

The victim had further said that the Appellant had bit her lips and as a result

her lips were swollen. But the JMO had not noted any abnormalities on her

lips when he examined her.

In this case, although the victim was subjected to this gruesome act of

violence, she was only examined two days after the incident. Hence, when

questioned by the defence the above-mentioned injuries could not be visible

due to the passing of time.

The learned High Court Judge, in his judgement had extensively considered

the medical evidence and come to an accurate finding that medical evidence

cannot override the ocular testimony of the witnesses.

The Counsel for the Appellant advanced in his second argument that the

prosecutrix has deliberately tried to change or develop her evidence,

especially when improbabilities in her story were highlighted during cross

examination.

The victim in this case was 53 years old at the time the offence was

committed and when she gave evidence, she was 56 years old. Hence, it is

not possible for her to give evidence which is 100% accurate and in line with

her statement to the police.

The learned High Court Judge in his judgment had extensively and

accurately considered all omissions and the contradiction before he could

come to a conclusion as to why he disbelieved the defence version.

Under our law the trial judge could disregard minor contradictions and

omissions in a case if such contradictions and omissions do not go to the

CA/HCC/0048/2023

6 | P a g e

root of the case. This orthodox position has been affirmed by several cases

in Sri Lanka.

In the case of Mazur Ivegen & Iana Bereznah vs AG SC/TAB/1/2015

Supreme court held that:

the contradictions and omissions marked by the defence are minor

contradictions and omissions which did not go to the root of the

prosecution case and therefore the lower court have correctly

disregarded the contradictions and omissions.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

[2011] SLR Vol. 2 pg. 292 held,

Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily affect

the trustworthiness of the witness statement, it is well established that

the Court must exercise its judgement on the nature of the inconsistency

or contradiction and whether they are material to the facts in issue.

Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and assail the

basic version of the witness cannot be given too much importance.

Witnesses should not have disbelieved on account of trifling

discrepancies and omissions. When contradictions are marked, the

Judge should direct his attention to whether they are material or not and

the witness should be given an opportunity of explaining the matter.

In this case the learned Trial Judge had properly considered omissions and

the contradictions and came to a correct conclusion that the omissions and

contradictions marked are incapable of creating a doubt on the prosecutrixs

evidence.

Finally, the Counsel of the Appellant contented that the learned Trial judge

has failed to consider the lack of credibility of the prosecutrix and has erred

in law by neglecting the need of cogent evidence on her part, especially in the

absence of any corroborating evidence.

Justice Dheeraratne in Sunil and others v. Attorney General [1986] 1 Sri.L.

R 230 held that:

Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness requiring

corroboration is otherwise credible. If the evidence of witness requiring

corroboration is not credible his testimony should be rejected and the

accused acquitted. Seeking corroboration of a witnesss evidence should

not be used as a process of inducing belief in such evidence where such

evidence is not credible.

It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman

victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence could

be acted on even the absence of corroboration.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat [1983] AIR 753 Indian Supreme

Court stated that:

refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault in the absence

of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to injury.

In this case the evidence given by the prosecutrix was not tainted with any

contradictions which affect the root of the case.

According to the prosecutrix the Appellant had forcibly raped her against her

will. She had never consented nor had she known the Appellant earlier as

contended by the Appellant. The Appellant had not put to the victim about

being seen by a woman when both were having censual sex. Then

immediately after the incident the victim had divulged to PW2 and her

husband and with the help of her grandson and PW2 the Appellant was

apprehended and handed over to the police. Further she had noted down the

CA/HCC/0048/2023

8 | P a g e

number of the Appellants motor bike and had handed it over to the police.

Further there was no reason for her to implicate anyone other than the

Appellant. Considering the evidence of the prosecutrix she was consistent

right throughout in revealing the incident. The learned High Court Judge

had accurately considered the defence evidence and given reasons as to why

he rejected the defence evidence.

The grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant have no merit as the

learned High Court Judge had accurately acted on the overwhelming

evidence given by the prosecutrix.

Therefore, I am of the view that there is no necessity to interfere with the

conviction and the sentence imposed on the Appellant. I therefore, affirm the

conviction and the sentence imposed upon the Appellant.

Considering the fact that the Appellant is in remand from the date of

conviction, I, order the sentence imposed on the Appellant be operative from

the date of sentence namely, 02.12.2022.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Hambantota along with the original case record.
