Facts in Brief

5. PW1 (S.I. Ruwan Kumara), PW2 (PC 12810 Nahinna), PW3 (PC

64085 Matara Arachchi), PW5 (PC 73165 Dinesh) and two other

officers; i.e PC 52373 Wijeraj and F.P.C.2981 Akila have been

attached to the narcotics bureau of the Police department at the

relevant period of time and they have been assigned to the unit

which conducted raids at the narcotics bureau.

6. At about 12.00 hrs on 14.02.2015, PW2 has received a tip off from

a private informant of his, regarding a person named, Wellidan

Sunendra Kumar alias Short, who was due to engage in a

transaction pertaining to the sale of a narcotic substance at a

location in W. A. De Silva Mawatha, Wellawatta. He has been

further informed that the suspect would travel in a threewheel

scooter to the relevant destination and such transaction was due

to take place between 14.00 hrs and 15.00 hrs on that day.

7. PW2 has notified PW1 regarding the tip off he received from his

private informant. PW1 has decided to conduct a raid and for that

purpose PW1 has gathered a team of officers which included PW2,

PW3, PW5 and two other officers named in paragraph 5 above.

PW1 has made an out note and left the bureau with the team of

officers in vehicle bearing registration no. HD2729, driven by PC

49466 Abeywickrama.

5

8. The team had proceeded along the High Level road, and arrived at

a location close to where the building known as Velasitha Niwasa

was situated. Thereafter, PW2 has got in touch with his informant

over the phone, the informant has arrived at the place where the

vehicle was parked and got into it. The team of officers together

with the informant have proceeded along Havelock road and

arrived at the Pamankada junction.

9. The Pamankada junction being a T-junction, the vehicle in which

the team of officers together with the informant travelled, has

made a right turn on to W. A. De Silva Mawatha. They have

proceeded along W. A. De Silva Mawatha for a short distance and

made a U-turn; upon making such U-turn, the officers have

observed in the locality a bookshop. The officers have been

informed by the informant that the transaction referred to in the

tip off would take place close to that location.

10. Thereafter, the team of officers with the informant have travelled

towards the Pamankada junction again and made a left turn and

got onto Havelock road. After proceeding a short distance on that

road, the vehicle has come to a halt.

PW1, PW2, PW5 and the informant have stepped out of the vehicle

and proceeded on foot towards the Pamankada junction again.

They have thereafter positioned themselves on the opposite side

of the bookshop on W. A. De Silva Mawatha and engaged in further

surveillance activity.

6

The informant has been with PW1, while PW2 and PW5 have

positioned themselves individually a little distance away from PW1

and the informant. After some time, they have been informed by

PW3 who was in the vehicle in which they travelled in, about the

threewheel scooter referred to by the informant, approaching W.

A. De Silva Mawatha. The threewheel scooter has had in it a

passenger in addition to its driver. The threewheel scooter had

made a right turn at the Pamankada junction, gone pass PW1, the

informant, PW2 and PW5 proceeded along W. A. Silva Mawatha

for some distance, made a U-turn and stopped at a location close

to the bookshop. At that moment, PW1 has requested the

informant to leave the scene, while PW1, PW2 and PW5 had

crossed the road and gone to the location where the threewheel

scooter was parked. PW1 with the help of PW5 has searched the

passenger and seized a parcel from the possession of the

passenger. PW1 has identified the substance in the parcel to be a

narcotic.

11. PW1 has questioned the passenger, the details narrated by the

passenger has confirmed the fact that he was the person referred

to by the informant. The passenger together with the driver of the

threewheel scooter have been arrested.

12. Subsequently, the team of officers have as narrated in the

evidence of PW1 and PW2 gone to the residence of the suspect (the

passenger) in Dematagoda, searched the residence but have not

found anything illegal, therein.

7

13. Thereafter, the suspects with the parcel and other productions

including the threewheel scooter have been taken to the narcotics

bureau. Basic tests have been conducted on the substance to

identify the nature of the narcotic. Tests have revealed that it was

a heroin mixed powder. The parcel containing the heroin mixed

powder has been placed in an envelope, sealed and handed over

to the production officer of the bureau upon it being registered.

The rest of the items brought to the bureau as productions have

been registered, handed over to the officer on reserve duty. The

sealed envelope containing the parcel with the heroin mixed

powder has thereafter been sent to the government analyst

department for tests. PW10 has run detailed tests on the

substance and confirmed it to be a heroin mixed powder and

prepared an analyst report accordingly.

Application of the Test of Probability to the Prosecutions

Case

14. An informant is a person who provides crime-related information

to law enforcement authorities. They are a vulnerable category of

people. Due to their vulnerability, the identity of an informant is

concealed at all times. An informant would be vulnerable to harm

by a criminal, a person who deals or is connected to a criminal.

Due to such vulnerability, law enforcement agencies at all times

take precautions to not divulge the identity of an informant. The

law enforcement agencies do so by not taking an informant to a

crime scene, by not divulging personal details or the identity of an

informant when giving evidence in a Court of law and by not

exposing an informant to a criminal or a person connected to a

8

criminal. In some instances, security is also provided to an

informant.

15. In the instant case, PW1 and PW2 in their evidence have stated

that the informant was taken along with them to a location close

to the place where the transaction in narcotics was going to take

place. In fact, it is their testimony that the informant was with

PW1 when the threewheel scooter in which the appellant travelled

in went past them. Such an incident discloses a situation where

the law enforcement authorities have not taken action to protect

the identity of an informant, which is not normal or is unusual.

16. Further, W. A. De Silva Mawatha, in Wellawatta has two ends.

One is the Pamankada junction end, on Havelock road and the

other is the Galle road end. The threewheel scooter in which the

appellant travelled has entered W. A. De Silva Mawatha from the

Pamankada junction end on Havelock road. To arrive at the

location close to the bookshop mentioned in the tip off, the

threewheel scooter has proceeded a short distance on W. A. De

Silva Mawatha towards the Galle road, and made a U-turn and

stopped at a location close to the bookshop. However, if it

continued to proceed on W. A. De Silva Mawatha without making

a U-turn, it would have gone onto Galle road, and disappeared

from the sight of PW1, PW2 and PW5. In those circumstances,

PW1, PW2 and PW5 would not have been able to search the

appellant for a narcotic substance. It is also stated in evidence

that when the threewheel scooter made a turn into W. A. De Silva

Mawatha, it travelled pass the locations where PW1, PW2 and

PW2 had positioned themselves. In those circumstances, it would

9

be natural in normal course of things for PW1, PW2 and PW5 to

stop the threewheel scooter at the first given opportunity and

search the persons who were riding in it. PW1, PW2 and PW5 have

not acted in that manner. They have also not explained the

reasons for not doing so. The actions of PW1, PW2 and PW5 reveal

a situation of just obeying rules or requests by superior officers

without a purpose.

17. In the case of Anthony Michael Morril vs. Attorney General

[CA 26/06, decided on 25.05.2010], Sarath De Abrew, J, has

stated,

In assessing the testimonial trustworthiness of this

witness, the learned trial judge had failed to employ the

yardstick of the Test of Probability and Improbability

which is a sine qua non in assessing the evidence of a

trained police witness, which test if it had been properly

used, would have created serious doubts as to the

certainty of this witness.

18. In Wickremasuriya vs. Dedoleena and Others [1996] 2 SLR

95 at page 98, F. N. D. Jayasuriya, J, has stated,

A Judge in applying the Test of probability and

Improbability relies heavily on his knowledge of men and

matters and the patterns of conduct in human beings both

ingenious and those who are less talented and fortunate.

10

19. Further, the Learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant has

also contended that, the testimony of a police officer is no more

acceptable or credible than the evidence of a lay witness and in

fact, unlike an unbiased, independent lay witness, a police officer

has an interest in the successful conclusion of a prosecution.

The Learned Presidents Counsel has also drawn the attention of

this Court to Law of Evidence by E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy,

Volume 2, Book 1 (at page 395) where it is stated that,

In great many cases, the police agents are as a rule

unreliable witnesses. It is always in their interest to

secure a conviction in the hope of getting a reward. Such

evidence ought, therefore, to be received with great

caution and should be closely scrutinised, particularly

where their evidence is the only corroborating evidence

for the evidence of the accomplice, as in bribery cases

20. In the case of Nallaperuma Danuka Roshan vs. Attorney

General [CA 216/15, decided on 12.10.2017], Dehideniya, J, has

stated,

in the present case also the only witness is a police

officer, trained in conducting narcotic raids. Therefore, his

evidence has to be scrutinized closely.

11

21. Furthermore, in the case of Sinnaiya Kalidasa vs. Attorney

General [CA 128/2005, decided on 07.09.2010], Ranjith Silva, J,

has stated,

By the same token the same principles should apply

and guide the judges in the assessment of the evidence

of excise officers in narcotic cases. Judges must not rely

on a non-existent presumption of truthfulness and

regularity as regards the evidence of such trained Police

or excise officers.

22. As the testimony of PW1 and PW2 is as discussed above, their

narrations are bizarre or unusual. The narrations being bizzare,

it is apparent that an improbable account of events that have

supposedly taken place have been stated by PW1 and PW2. When

evaluating the testimonial trust worthiness of PW1 and PW2, the

Learned High Court Judge has failed to direct her attention to the

matters discussed above and employ the test of probability and

improbability in that regard. If such a test had been employed, a

serious doubt would have been created as to the certainty of the

testimony of PW1 and PW2. The Learned High Court Judge has

misdirected herself when she failed to employ such a test to arrive

at a finding on the testimonial trustworthiness of PW1 and PW2.

Failed to consider a vital contradiction?

23. PW1 in his evidence in chief has stated that he searched the

appellant and took into his custody a parcel of some substance,

thereafter ascertained the substance to be a narcotic. And the

12

nature of the narcotic to be a heroin mixed powder. The parcel

according to him was made using a pink coloured plastic bag with

a knot on top. However, the same witness on another occasion has

stated that the parcel was made using a blue coloured plastic bag

and such blue coloured plastic bag was in a second plastic bag

which was pink in colour. The pink coloured plastic bag had been

the one visible to a person who took possession of the parcel.

24. PW1 accordingly has contradicted himself per-se on that fact.

The contradiction being in regard to the interpretation of the

parcel which contained the substance which was ascertained to

be narcotic in the nature of a heroin mixed powder, such

contradiction is a material one in our view. The Learned High

Court Judge in the impugned judgment has disregarded such

contradiction on the basis that it is a typo. However, the Learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant has drawn attention of this

Court to the fact that the proceedings have been corrected prior

to the date the matter was fixed for judgment and to the fact that

the prosecution has not made any attempt to correct the same if

it was a typo as the Learned High Court Judge has concluded. It

is further contended that there is no basis to arrive at a conclusion

as the Learned High Court Judge has done and therefore

misdirected herself in that regard.

25. In K. Padmatillake alias Sergeant Elpitiya vs. The Director

General, Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

13

Corruption [SC Appeal 99/2007, S.C. Minute Dated

30.07.2009], Chandra Ekanayake, J, has stated,

It has to be stressed here that credibility of prosecution

witnesses should be subject to judicial evaluation in

totality and not isolated scrutiny by the judge. When

witnesses make inconsistent statements in their evidence

either at one stage or at 2 stages, the testimony of such

witnesses is unreliable and in the absence of special

circumstances, no conviction can be based on the

testimony of such witnesses. On the other hand one

cannot be unmindful of the proposition that Court cannot

mechanically reject the evidence in criminal cases it

would be of importance to quote what Sir John Woodroffe

& Amir Ali had to say in their work on Law of Evidence

18th Edition-Vol. 1 at page 471:-

No hard and fast rule can be laid down about

appreciation of evidence. It is after all a question of

fact and each case has to be decided on the facts as

they stand in that particular case. Where a witness

makes two inconsistent statements in his evidence

with regard to a material fact and circumstance, the

testimony of such a witness becomes unreliable and

unworthy of credence.

26. Further, since I have dealt with the second and third grounds of

appeal as set out above, a need would not arise to consider the

14

remainder of the grounds of appeal. Therefore, I refrain from doing

so.

27. It has been concluded that an improbable account of events that

had supposedly taken place have been narrated, by PW1 and PW2

at the trial. Hence the credibility of those witnesses are in issue.

The probability of the prosecution establishing its case beyond a

reasonable doubt is remote. Having considered the above, we are

of the view that this is not a fit case to order a retrial.

28. The Accused-Appellant is acquitted of the charges preferred

against him.

29. The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this

judgment to the High Court of Colombo for compliance.

Appeal allowed.
