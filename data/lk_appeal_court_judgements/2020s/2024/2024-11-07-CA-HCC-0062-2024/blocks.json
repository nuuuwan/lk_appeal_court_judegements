Having regard to the manner and the ingenuity with which the crimes that the Accused-Respondent has committed to which he has pleaded guilty, we are of the view that the sentence imposed is grossly inadequate. In our view the crimes to which the Accused-Respondent pleaded guilty are of a very serious nature and have been committed with much planning, deliberation and manipulation and called for an immediate custodial sentence.",
