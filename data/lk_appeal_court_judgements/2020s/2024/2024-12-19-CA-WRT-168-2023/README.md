Briefly, the relevant facts of the case are stated as follows:

As per the petition, the Petitioner is the daughter of one Malhami Arachchige Don Justin

Perera who lived as a tenant under the National Housing at assessment No. 106/1 (now

Page 5 of 8

93/1) formally Baptist Mawatha and now Kanatha Road, Thalapathpitiya, Nugegoda. The

Petitioner states that the Petitioners mother left the matrimonial home due to a

matrimonial dispute and thereafter, the Petitioners father, the said Justin Perera had an

extramarital relationship with the 5th Respondent as a result of which the 5th Respondent

came to live in the impugned premises in 1976. The Petitioner avers that the Petitioners

father passed away on 05.07.1995 who was the permanent tenant of the said premises

which comes under Ceiling on Housing Property Law No. 1 of 1973 until his demise.

The Petitioner contends that subsequent to the death of the Petitioners father, the 5th

Respondent has fraudulently tendered the documents representing as the widow of late

Don Justin Perera to the 1st Respondent and requested to effect a deed of transfer in her

favour in respect of the said premises. Later, the 5th Respondent obtained the ownership

of the property by Deed No. 17469 executed on 12.01.2010 between the 3rd Respondent

and the 5th Respondent.

The main ground urged by the Petitioner is that, the said transfer of the property to the

5th Respondent by the 1st Respondent on the basis that the 5th Respondent was the wife of

late Don Justice Perera by producing false documents is illegal and ultra vires.

We are mindful that the said deed bearing No. 17469 was executed on 12.01.2010.

However, the Petitioner filed this application on 24.03.2023. It is to be noted that the

Petitioner has failed to disclose the reasons for the delay in seeking relief from this Court.

Further, we note that there is no indication in the petition as to when the Petitioner

instituted the application in the District Court of Nugegoda.

When we peruse the said deed marked as X7, the 1st Respondent had taken action to

transfer the deed to the 5th Respondent under Section 12 (2) of the Ceiling on Housing

Property Law No. 1 of 1973 which reads as follows:

Page 6 of 8

Where the commissioner is of the opinion that any house transferred under

subsection (1) is required for the purposes of the redevelopment of the area in

which such house is situated, he may, by notification published in the Gazette,

cancel, with effect from such date as may be specified in such Notification, the

instrument of disposition by which such house was so transferred upon the

cancellation of any such instrument, the title to the house in respect of which such

instrument was execute shall revert to, and vest in, the commissioner free from all

encumbrances.

According to the said Section, it gives discretion to the Commissioner to sell the property

to any other person if the tenant does not accept the offer by the Commissioner. In the

instant case, the original tenant; Justin Perera passed away on 05.07.1995. However, this

transfer took place on 12.01.2010. Further, we observe that the 5th Respondent has paid

consideration of Rs. 21,900/- for the said transfer.

The question before is by transferring the property to the 5th Respondent, has the

Commissioner exceeded his authority. This was considered by His Lordship S.

Sriskandarajah J in Fernando Vs. Commissioner of National Housing & another, CA

WRIT 2053/2003 decided on 02.05.2008, 2008 BLR page 266 at page 268 held that:

Under the above provision (Section 12) the Commissioner is entitled to sell the

said premises to the tenant, if there is no recognised tenant he could sell it to any

person. In these circumstances the Commissioner has not exceeded his authority

in offering the said premises for sale to the 2nd Respondent first and if he fails to

accept, to offer it to the Petitioner. As the 2nd Respondent is in continuous

occupation of the said premises the said decision cannot be considered as

unreasonable.

Page 7 of 8

We also note that there is no evidence placed by the Petitioner that the 5th Respondent

claimed or demanded the particular deed to be transferred in her name as a successor to

the tenant.

During the argument stage, the Counsel for the 5th Respondent brought to the notice of

the Court that in the document marked X8, the 5th Respondent indicated that although

she and the deceased original tenant lived as husband and wife, she was not legally

married to him. Her claim was that she continuously occupied the said premises. This

shows that the 5th Respondent did not misrepresent the facts to the 1st Respondent when

the deed was transferred.

In the instant case, the Petitioner challenges the decision of the 1st Respondent by way

of an application for judicial review.

The concept of judicial review is considered in the following judgment.

In Reg. v. Hull University Visitor, Ex. P., 1993 Appeal Cases, page 682, at page 700, Lord

Browne Wilkinson J. held;

Over the last 40 years, the courts have developed general principles of judicial

review. The fundamental principle is that the courts will intervene to ensure that

the powers of public decision-making bodies are exercised lawfully. In all cases,

save possibly one, this intervention by way of prohibition or certiorari is based on

the proposition that such powers have been conferred on the decision maker on the

underlying assumption that the powers are to be exercised only within the

jurisdiction conferred, in accordance with fair procedures and, in a Wednesbury

sense (Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation

[1948] 1 K.B. 223), reasonably. If the decision maker exercises his powers outside

the jurisdiction conferred, in a manner which is procedurally irregular or is

Page 8 of 8

Wednesbury unreasonable, he is acting ultra vires his powers and therefore

unlawfully.

In the instant case, the Petitioner has failed to establish that the decision made by the 1st

Respondent falls within any of the grounds for judicial review and thereby is ultra vires.

Thus, this Court holds that the decision of the 1st Respondent marked as X8 is in

accordance with law.

For the above said reasons, we dismiss the application with cost.
