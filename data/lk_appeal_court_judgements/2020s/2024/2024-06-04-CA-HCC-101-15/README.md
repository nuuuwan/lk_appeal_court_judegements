The 2nd accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Chilaw

along with another two accused in terms of Section 296 of the Penal

Code for committing the murder of Perimasamy Sadasivam

Subramanium, on or about 24.03.1996 at Kiriyankalliya. The 3rd

accused had died prior to the trial. The 1st accused absconded during

the trial and the trial proceeded in his absence. After trial, the 1st and

2nd accused have been convicted for the charge of Murder by the

Judgment dated 15.06.2015 and death sentence was imposed upon

them. This appeal has been preferred by the 2nd accused- appellant

against the said conviction.

Prior to the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for

the 2nd accused-appellant (herein after referred to as the appellant)

and the learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) for the respondent

Page 3 of 12

filed written submissions. At the hearing, the learned Presidents

Counsel and the learned Additional Solicitor General made oral

submissions.

Briefly, the prosecution case is as follows:

PW-1 and PW-2 are the eyewitnesses to the incident. According to

PW- 2, on the day of the incident, she had gone to the brick kiln owned

by her husband, PW-1. On her way, she had seen the 2nd accused-

appellant and the 3rd accused assaulting the deceased with clubs, in

the house of the 2nd accused-appellant. When she inquired about the

reason why the accused were assaulting the deceased, they told PW-2

that they want to know something from the deceased. Thereafter,

PW-2 had gone to work to the brick kiln. While PW-2 was working in

the brick kiln, she had seen the 1st accused coming to the place of

incident and the three accused who were armed with clubs taking the

deceased to the palmyra woods behind the house of the 2nd accused-

appellant.

Around 3.00- 3.30 pm, PW-1, the husband of PW-2 had also arrived at

the brick kiln to work. After hearing the cries of a person asking not to

beat him from the direction of the 2nd accused-appellants house, PW-1

had inquired his wife about the noise. Thereafter, both PW-1 and PW-2

had gone to the place of the incident and witnessed the 2nd accused

appellant and the 3rd accused continuously assaulting the deceased.

However, PW-1 and PW-2 have interfered and taken the deceased to the

Chilaw hospital. He died on 31.03.1996 at the hospital after seven days

from the incident as a result of the injuries.

At the trial, the prosecution led the evidence of six witnesses. Dying

declaration made to the police by the deceased while undergoing

treatment in the hospital has been admitted as evidence in terms of

Section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance. After the prosecution case was

Page 4 of 12

closed, the 2nd accused-appellant gave evidence on oaths and his

mother was called as a defence witness.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant advanced his

arguments mainly on the ground that the learned High Court Judge

has misdirected himself on facts and law in coming to a conclusion. In

addition, the learned Presidents Counsel contended that the learned

Trial Judge had wrongly relied upon the dying declaration. He also

contended that even if the prosecution story is believed to be true and

correct, the accused-appellant could be convicted only for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder but not for murder.

The learned Additional Solicitor General submitted that the deceased

and the 2nd accused-appellant were residing in close proximity, and

PW-1 and PW-2 had no enmity with the 2nd accused-appellant to give

false evidence against him. The learned ASG contended that the learned

Trial Judge correctly considered the dying declaration and the evidence

of PW-1 and PW-2 regarding the incident and has come to the correct

conclusion.

In this case, a dying declaration recorded by a police officer has been

marked as P-2. The learned High Court Judge has relied upon the dying

declaration in determining the action. In his Judgment, the learned

Judge has extensively dealt with the legal position in accepting a dying

declaration as evidence of a case. The learned Judge has observed that

a dying declaration is also hearsay evidence. The legal position

regarding a dying declaration stated in the Judgment is correct.

However, the legal position stated by the learned Judge regarding the

admissibility of hearsay evidence is incorrect. His observation regarding

the admissibility of hearsay evidence is as follows:

.

(page 16 of the High Court Judgement).

According to the learned High Court Judge, in cases where justice

would not be served if the hearsay evidence is not admitted and the

harm caused by its admission is minimal, provisions are made in Law

of Evidence to admit such hearsay evidence. With due respect to the

learned High Court Judge, I must say that there is no such provision in

the Evidence Ordinance. The rule applicable in accepting or rejecting

hearsay is that when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth

of what is contained in the statement, it is inadmissible and when it is

proposed to establish by the evidence not the truth of the statement but

the fact that the statement was made, it is admissible. The above legal

position has been explained in the Privy Council decision of

Subramaniam V. Public Prosecutor (1956) 1 W.L.R. 965.

The Evidence Ordinance does not state anywhere that hearsay evidence

is inadmissible. However, Section 60 (2) of the Evidence Ordinance

states that oral evidence must, in all cases whatever, be direct; that is

to say, if it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the evidence

of a witness who says he heard that fact. The Evidence Ordinance

provides for from Sections 17 to 39 to admit hearsay evidence.

Accordingly, in terms of Section 32, a statement, written or verbal,

made by a person who is dead could be led in evidence when the

statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death, or as to any

of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death, in

cases in which the cause of that persons death comes into question. A

dying declaration can be led in evidence in terms of the aforesaid section

of the Evidence Ordinance. Therefore, in the instant action, the dying

declaration can be accepted as evidence of the case. However, as

decided in Ranasinghe V. Attorney General (2007) 1 Sri. L.R. 218,

the Trial Judge must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt whether the

Page 6 of 12

statement made by the deceased was true and accurate and whether

the statement made by the deceased could be accepted beyond

reasonable doubt because the statement of the deceased had not been

made under oath and the statement had not been tested by cross-

examination.

PW-1 is the brother of the deceased. PW-2 is the wife of PW-1. The

learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant pointed out a vital

contradiction between the dying declaration and the evidence of PW-1

and PW-2 in respect of the place where the deceased was assaulted.

According to the dying declaration, when the deceased was sleeping in

his house, the 2nd and 3rd accused came armed with clubs and the 3rd

accused dealt a blow to his head with a club. Thereafter, the deceased

was taken outside the house, and then the 1st accused came and

assaulted him. However, according to PW-1 and PW-2, the learned

Presidents Counsel pointed out that the deceased was assaulted by the

2nd and 3rd accused when the deceased was in the verandah of the

house of the 2nd accused-appellant.

The learned Additional Solicitor General contended in reply that there

was no contradiction between the dying declaration and the evidence of

PW-1 and PW-2 regarding the aforesaid point because in the dying

declaration, it is stated about the commencement of the assault and

PW-1 and PW-2 have described not about the commencement but the

events that took place subsequently.

I regret that I am unable to agree with the contention of the learned

ASG because in the dying declaration, not only the commencement of

the assault but also the entire incident of assault has been described

by the deceased. He stated that after dealing a blow to his head, he was

taken outside from his house and again he was hit on his legs and

spine. However, the deceased has never stated that he was assaulted

when he was in the verandah or anywhere at the 2nd accused-

Page 7 of 12

appellants house. It is clear from the evidence of PW-1 appearing on

page 104 of the appeal brief and the evidence of PW-2 appearing on

page 124 of the appeal brief that both of them have clearly stated that

the deceased was assaulted by the 2nd and 3rd accused when he was in

the verandah of the 2nd appellants house. Therefore, there is a vital

contradiction that goes to the root of the case in respect of the place of

assault. If the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 is accepted, the deceaseds

dying declaration that he was assaulted when he was sleeping at his

house would be improbable. If the dying declaration is accepted as true,

the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 would be improbable. Because of the

said contradictory positions, a reasonable doubt arises on the

prosecution case.

Be that as it may, it is apparent from the medical evidence that the

dying declaration is improbable and cannot be relied upon because the

doctor who conducted the postmortem examination has clearly stated

in his evidence that there is no injury to the head of the deceased. The

doctor has described two bruise marks and ten abrasions as external

injuries and seven contusions as internal injuries. However, there is no

any kind of injury on the head of the deceased. If an accused had

inflicted a blow to the head of the deceased with a club, there must be

some kind of injury on his head. Therefore, his dying declaration that a

blow was inflicted on his head when he was sleeping at his home cannot

be believed.

The important matter that arises from the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2

is that the 2nd accused-appellant also stated in his evidence that the

deceased was assaulted when he was at his home. Accordingly, what

the learned High Court Judge should have ascertained is whether the

deceased was assaulted by 2nd and 3rd accused and then by the 1st

accused as stated by PW-1 and PW-2 or whether the deceased was

assaulted only by the 1st accused as stated by the 2nd accused-appellant

when the deceased was at the 2nd accused-appellants house. However,

Page 8 of 12

the learned High Court Judge has not considered these matters. He

accepted the dying declaration, which contradicts the evidence of PW-1

and PW-2 as well as the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2 and concluded that

the charge has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. As explained

previously, according to the medical evidence, this assault could not

have happened in the way described by the deceased in his dying

declaration. In addition, if the dying declaration is accepted, PW-1 and

PW-2s evidence that assault took place in the 2nd appellants house

cannot be believed. Without considering this vital contradiction which

affects the entire prosecution case, the learned Trial Judge has come to

the conclusion that the prosecution has proved its case beyond a

reasonable doubt.

On the other hand, when the prosecution witnesses, PW-1 and PW-2

also state that the deceased was assaulted when he was at the 2nd

appellants house, the learned Trial Judge should have considered

whether the incident could have taken place as described by the 2nd

appellant in his evidence because according to him also, the deceased

was assaulted when he was at his house. The Supreme Court of India,

held in the case of Dudh Nath pandey V. The State of U.P., decided

on 11th February 1981, reported in 1981 AIR 911, 1981 SCR (2) 771

that defence witnesses are entitled to equal treatment with those of the

prosecution.

Instead, the learned High Court Judge has erroneously rejected the

evidence of the 2nd accused as well as the evidence of the defence

witness using a confessionary statement that could not be admitted as

evidence and in fact was not presented during the trial. The reason for

rejecting the evidence of the 2nd accused according to the Judgement of

the learned High Court Judge is that the 2nd appellant had stated in his

statement to the police that he assaulted the deceased with a

broomstick. The learned Judge stated that as a contradiction, the said

portion of the police statement has been marked X-1. [page 27 of the

Page 9 of 12

High Court Judgment] It is apparent from the proceedings of the trial

that the 2nd accuseds statutory statement has been marked as X-1

(page 257 of the appeal brief). In the non-summary proceedings, when

making the statutory statement, the accused had stated that he does

not say anything to the charge and that a written submission would be

tendered on behalf of him. Apart from that, the learned Additional

Solicitor General pointed out that another X-1 has been marked at

page 285 of the appeal brief. This X-1 has been marked as a

contradiction. The contradictory portion reads as follows:

4 :01

..

Therefore, it is apparent that a portion of 2nd accuseds statement to the

police saying that he assaulted the deceased with a broomstick has not

been marked as X-1 in this case. Therefore, the learned High Court

Judge misdirected himself, used a certain portion of the police

statement that was not led as evidence of the case and rejected the

evidence of the 2nd accused-appellant erroneously. It is vital to note that

it is not an unsworn statement from the dock, but the 2nd accused-

appellant had given evidence on oaths, and he had been cross-

examined. The learned Trial Judge not only rejected the evidence of the

2nd accused-appellant on the aforesaid completely wrong basis but also

rejected the evidence of the defence witness stating in his Judgment

that the defence witnesss evidence that led to corroborate the evidence

of the 2nd accused need not be considered as the evidence of the 2nd

accused has been rejected. Therefore, it is apparent that the evidence

of the 2nd accused-appellant as well as the evidence of the defence

witness has been rejected by the learned Trial Judge on a completely

wrong basis. Therefore, this is a case where the Judgment was entered

without considering the defence case which should have been

considered by the learned Trial Judge. Obviously, whatever evidence

has been presented on behalf of the prosecution, the Judgment entered

without considering the defence evidence cannot be allowed to stand.

Page 10 of 12

In this case, as explained previously, the prosecution case consists of

lot of infirmities. The prosecution evidence is contradictory. Dying

declaration cannot be believed when considering the medical evidence.

Hence, even without considering the defence case, it can be concluded

that the prosecution has not proved the charge beyond a reasonable

doubt. However, the learned Trial Judge rejected the defence evidence

and concluded that the prosecution has proved the charge of murder

beyond a reasonable doubt, which I hold is a wrong conclusion.

Another important matter pointed out by the learned Presidents

Counsel was that the aforesaid X-1, that was erroneously used by the

learned High Court Judge to reject the appellants evidence cannot be

admitted as evidence under any circumstances because it is a

confessionary statement. I agree with the said contention of the learned

Presidents Counsel. The learned High Court Judge made two major

errors in referring to "X-1", a portion of the appellant's police statement

in which he claimed to have assaulted the deceased with a broomstick.

One of the errors made by the learned Trial Judge is that the said

portion of the police statement of the appellant, which was not the

evidence of the case, has been used to reject the defence evidence. The

other error made by the learned Trial Judge is that the 2nd accused-

appellants confessionary statement, which cannot be admitted in

evidence in terms of Section 25(1) of the Evidence Ordinance has been

used in determining the action. Section 25(1) of the Evidence Ordinance

states that no confession made to a police officer shall be proved as

against a person accused of any offence. In Seyadu v. The King - 53

NLR 251, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that "Under section 25 of

the Evidence Ordinance, a confession made to a police officer is

inadmissible as proof against the person making it whether as

substantive evidence or in order to show that he has contradicted

himself. The circumstance that no objection was taken to the reception

of such evidence at the time is immaterial." It has been held in this

Page 11 of 12

Judgment that a confessionary statement is inadmissible even if such

statement had come to the case record without an objection.

In King v. Emanis - 42 NLR 166, De Krester J held that "A statement

made by an accused person to a Police Officer in the course of an

investigation under section 122(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code may

be used to contradict him provided the statement is not a confession

within the meaning of section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance. Hence, it

is apparent that confessionary statement cannot be used even to

contradict the accused.

In the case at hand, the learned Trial Judge has used a confessionary

statement of the 2nd accused-appellant which is not a part of the

evidence led before him to reject his evidence. Therefore, the evidence

of the 2nd accused-appellant and the evidence of the defence witness

has been rejected by the learned High Court Judge erroneously and

illegally. Hence, this is a Judgment given without considering the

defence evidence as well as the vital infirmities of the prosecution case.

It must be noted that in the case of Anthony Michael Morril V.

Attorney General Court of Appeal Case No. CA 26/06, decided on

25.05.2010, it was decided that the presumption of innocence should

be operative until the learned Trial Judge peruse and analyze the

entirety of the evidence led in the case, that of the prosecution as well

as that of the defence. In the case at hand, as explained previously, the

appellants evidence as well as the defence witnesss evidence that

should have been analyzed by the learned Trial Judge, have not been

analyzed in entering the Judgment.

To summarize, the learned High Court Judge has not taken into

account that the vital contradiction of the evidence of PW-1 and PW-2

with the dying declaration would cast reasonable doubt on the

prosecution case. The defence evidence that should have been analyzed

has not been analyzed and rejected on a completely erroneous basis.

Page 12 of 12

Thus, the learned High Court Judge misdirected himself on law as well

as facts and has come to a wrong conclusion.

For the foregoing reasons, the Judgment dated 15.06.2015, the

conviction and the death sentence imposed on the 2nd accused-

appellant are set aside. The 2nd accused-appellant is acquitted of the

charge of murder.

The appeal is allowed.
