The Petitioner states that the prosecuting officer in the said case is a Senior State Counsel Mr. Janaka Bandara and that he is also named as a Respondent in the matter taken up for inquiry at the said Commission Chaired by the 1st to 3rd Respondents. The 1st to 3rd Respondents who constitute this Commission, cannot take steps which would directly or indirectly call into question any of the ongoing judicial proceedings, including those connected with the Complainant in the aforesaid Complaint No. PCI/PV/01/Com./50/2020 as the matter inquired into by this commission is under judicial consideration and is thus sub judice. It is the role of the courts to deal with legal issues that are before it. The courts' role should not be usurped by the Respondents making statements/ findings or recommendations concerning how these issues should be dealt with. The notification published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2157/44 dated 09th of January 2020 which sets out the parameters of the Mandate of the Respondents, specifically states in the eighth recital thereof that \"the scope of the inquiry into the said matter under this warrant would not in any way impose a fetter upon the relevant authorities exercising their statutory",

After Your Lordship delivered the judgment, it was brought to my attention as the Attorney General I wrote to the Cabinet of Ministers and wanted a policy decision taken across the board in respect for all these recommendations given by Upali Abeyrathne Commission and also made my suggestion that this matter should come to an end.

They stopped short of making any pronouncement on the Upali Abeyrathna Commission report but of course said that they will not interfere in the Court proceedings before Your Lordships' Court. Those are the very words which they said. It will not interfere in the proceedings initiated before Your Lordships Court. \" \"Now having briefed Your Lordships Court based on what I just mentioned, my submission before Your Lordships Court is that the Upali Abeyrathna Commission Report, the appointing Authority in its wisdom thought it fit, it should not be acted on its own. It should go passed the shifting process of a Special Presidential Commission of inquiry. That Commission of inquiry it should be recorded that nothing flows from the Upali Abeyrathna Commission report. And it is a matter of futility with all due respect whether these cases should proceed I am not for a moment trying to debunk the position taken up by the Petitioner, but I am saying that nothing flows from it because it had a two-tier stage, one tier which had made the recommendation, the 2nd tier came to an abrupt end. So, what is left now, nothing flows from it. \"",

A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought. In other words, he must, by use of his reason, ascertain and follow the course which reason directs. He must act reasonably. (Lord Wrenbury, page 613). It is important to note that there are a few cases in which the matters of Writs concerning the Presidential Commission of Inquiry were decided.",
