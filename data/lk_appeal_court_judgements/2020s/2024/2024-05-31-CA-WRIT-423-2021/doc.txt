Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioners of the Applications bearing numbers CA/WRIT/420/2021,

CA/WRIT/423/2021 and CA/WRIT/431/2021 are primarily seeking a mandate in the

nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Fauna and Flora (Protection, Well-being and

Regularization of Registration of Tamed Elephants) Regulations No. 01 of 2021 (hereinafter

referred to as Regulations) published in Gazette Extraordinary No.241/41 on 19.08.2021.

The Petitioners in the Application bearing No.CA/WRIT/433/2021 primarily seek a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the Order of the learned Magistrate of Colombo dated 06.09.2021 by

which the learned Magistrate has decided to release the elephants subjected to such case to

their registered owners/custodians according to the aforementioned impugned Regulations.

Additionally, a Writ of Mandamus is sought directing the Department of Wildlife

Conservation to seize the possession of the elephants who were ordered to be released as per

the said Order of the Magistrates Court. The Petitioners in the connected matters also

Page 33 of 69

challenge the said Orders of the learned Magistrate of Colombo as well as the Order of the

learned Magistrate of Matale dated 06.09.2021.

On 18.01.2024 the learned Counsel who appeared for the Petitioners and Respondents in the

above-mentioned four Applications (CA/WRIT/420/2021, CA/WRIT/423/2021,

CA/WRIT/431/2021 and CA/WRIT/433/2021) after concluding their oral submissions

invited this Court to pronounce one judgement in respect of all four cases.

Impugned Regulations

The impugned Regulations have been issued by the respective State Minister purportedly

under section 22A of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance [Chapter 469] (hereinafter

referred to as FFPO) read with section 71 of the said FFPO. Part I of the said Regulations

deal with the protection and well-being of tamed elephants, whereas Part III provides for

obtaining tamed elephants for historical/cultural processions. Part II of these Regulations

deals with regularizing the registration of tamed elephants. The grounds of the Petitioners to

challenge the above-mentioned Orders of the learned Magistrate who released the elephants

to the original owners/custodians are also mainly based on the provisions in the said Part II

of the Ordinance.

Until those impugned Regulations were published in the year 2021, the regulations published

in the Gazette Extraordinary Notification No.662/4 on 14.05.1991 governed the registration

and issuance of licenses for tuskers and elephants. It is noted that serious concerns were raised

during the hearing whether the said Gazette Notification No. 662/4 has been duly approved

by the Parliament.

In terms of Regulation No.5(1)1 of the said Regulations the application for the registration of

an elephant for the first time shall be made substantially in the form set out in Schedule II

thereto subject to the conditions specified therein. Regulation 5(2)2 provides that the

1 Regulation 5(1): The application for registration of an elephant for the first time shall be made substantially in the Form set out in Schedule Il hereto subject to the conditions specified therein. 2 Regulation 5(2): The application for registration of an elephant that is in the custody of an owner but has not been registered as at the date of commencement of these regulations shall be made substantially in the Form set out in Schedule III hereto subject to the conditions specified therein.

Page 34 of 69

application for the registration of an elephant that is in the custody of an owner but has not

been registered as of the date of commencement of those Regulations shall be substantially in

the form set out in Schedule III thereto subject to the conditions specified therein. The

provisions stipulated in section 5(2) are crucial as the main arguments of the Petitioners based

on these provisions to challenge the Regulations as well as the respective Orders of the learned

Magistrates who made decisions following these Regulations.

Regulation 6(1) describes the required accompanying documents for the said first-time

registration whilst Regulation 6(2)3 provides that any person having the ownership of an

elephant by a license, sannasa or other legal document or by succession as at the date of

commencement of these regulations shall register such elephant under these regulations and

such registration shall be obtained within three months from the date of coming into operation

of these regulations.

The above provisions detail the procedures and requirements for first-time registration

applications for elephants. Such applicants must follow the format provided in Schedule II,

adhering to specified conditions. Elephants, already in an owner's custody but not yet

registered at the time these regulations come into effect, must use the application format in

Schedule III, subject to specific conditions. This provision is pivotal in legal challenges against

the rules and the learned Magistrate's decisions based on them. The owners of elephants, who

possess them through a license, sannasa, other legal documents, or by succession, must register

these elephants within three months from the date the Regulations commence.

Key Arguments Presented by Petitioners on the on the Part II of the Regulations

The Petitioners submit that the provisions of the impugned Regulations are ex facie contravene

the provisions of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, FFPO and the Offences Against Public

Property Act No.12 of 1982. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners in

3 Regulation 6(2): Any person having the ownership of an elephant by a licence, sannasa or other legal document or by succession as at the date of commencement of these regulations shall register such elephant under these regulations and such registration shall be obtained within three months from the date of coming into operation of these regulations.

Page 35 of 69

CA/Writ/420/2021 referring to section 22A (12) of the FFPO asserts that the Sri Lankan

elephant is expressly declared as public property in terms of the FFPO, and consequently all

offences committed against an elephant, including the offence of unlawful possession of an

elephant, are punishable under the said Offences Against Public Property Act read together

with the provisions of the FFPO.

The Petitioners contend that Regulation 5(2) of the impugned Regulations is untenable in law

and contrary to sections 22A (7), 22A (12) and 23 of the FFPO. Further, the Petitioners submit

that Regulation 6(2) is also contrary to section 22A of the FFPO and untenable in law. In

addition to the above, the Petitioners challenge the Regulations 6(3)4 and 7(1)5 as well.

Similarly, several concerns have been raised by the Petitioners in respect of Regulation 8.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioners in CA/Writ/420/2021 contends that if a

person purportedly owns or has in his custody or possession an elephant or makes use of an

elephant, he must mandatorily show that the said elephant is registered and a license has been

obtained in respect thereof in terms of section 22A of the FFPO. In the event the elephant is

without registration and a license, such purported custodian/owner is deemed to have

committed a non-bailable offence punishable under section 22A (7) or 23 (1) of the FFPO and

the Offences Against Public Property Act. Another important argument raised by the learned

4 Regulation 6(3): (a) Every application submitted under regulation 5 shall be referred by the prescribed officer to the Examination Committee appointed under regulation 8 for examination. (b) The Committee shall determine the criteria for the examination of such eligibility which shall then be referred to the Secretary for his approval. (c) After examining the eligibility of the relevant applicant in keeping with the criteria approved by the Secretary, such Committee shall submit a report to the Secretary to the Ministry of the Minister assigned the subject of Wildlife (hereinafter referred to as the "Secretary") within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of the application. (d) Such application and the report in respect thereof shall be referred by the Secretary to the recommendation committee appointed under regulation 8 within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of such report. (e) After considering the application along with the report referred to in paragraph (d) the recommendation Committee shall submit its recommendations to the Cabinet of Ministers by a Cabinet Memorandum within a period of two weeks from the date of receipt of such application along with the report. (f) The Cabinet of Ministers may grant approval for the issuance of a licence after taking into consideration the recommendations submitted by the recommendation committee. 5 Regulation 7(1): The prescribed officer shall register any person who has fulfilled the eligibility criteria and shall issue a licence substantially in the Form set out in Schedule IV hereto subject to the conditions specified therein.

Page 36 of 69

Presidents Counsel is that the law does not permit the registration of an elephant or the

issuance of a license under the FFPO retroactively.

The attention of this Court has been drawn to the Report (P20 in CA/Writ/420/2021)

compiled by the retired Supreme Court judge Nimal Edward Dissanayake. Certain

paragraphs of pages 1-3 of the said Report which is in Sinhala language have been translated

by the Petitioners as below: (Vide- written submissions of the Petitioners in

CA/Writ/420/2021)

In the above context, it is important to draw Your Lordships' attention to the

Report of His Lordship, Justice N. Dissanayake at 'P20' at, where it is reported that the

increase in demand for elephants for processions, organized by various religious

institutions, as well as due to a perception by a "class of new rich businessmen" that

owning and rearing elephants "will enhance their standing in society", had led to a

lucrative illicit trade of elephant calves stolen from the wild and sold. Justice Dissanayake

reports that "unscrupulous persons with the support of a few corrupt officials of the

Department of Wild Life Conservation" engaged in mass scale capturing of baby

elephants from the jungles of Habarana, Yala, Udawalawe, and the North Central

Province and selling them. Some of these persons had at their disposal, fleets of vehicles

like high-powered off-road jeeps for their travel. They possessed trucks that could go into

deep jungles and bring back baby elephants etc. They had unlicensed guns, tranquilizing

equipment, and ammunition etc., at their disposal. The evidence led before the

Committee of Inquiry had revealed that the following methods had been used by the

culprits in capturing and transport of baby elephants from the jungle;

1. By shooting and killing the mother elephant;

2. By sedating the mother elephant by using the tranquilizing guns;

3. By injecting tranquilizers to the baby elephants;

4. Capturing baby elephants released into the jungle after rehabilitation by the "Ath-Athuru-

Sevena-Udawalawe";

Page 37 of 69

5. Taking baby elephants from the "Ath-Athuru-Sevena" with or without the knowledge of the

Wild Life Department". [vide pages 1 -3 of the Report]

In the above context, I need to take cognizance of the facts mentioned in the said report which

are vital to instant Applications. It is reported that the increase in demand for elephants for

processions, organized by various religious institutions, and the perception by a "class of new

rich businessmen" that owning and rearing elephants "will enhance their standing in society,"

has led to a lucrative illicit trade of elephant calves stolen from the wild and sold. It is divulged

in the said Report that "unscrupulous persons with the support of a few corrupt officials of

the Department of Wildlife Conservation" have engaged in the mass-scale capturing of baby

elephants from the jungles of Habarana, Yala, Udawalawe, and the North Central Province

and selling them. Fleets of vehicles like high-powered off-road jeeps for travel, trucks capable

of entering deep jungles to bring back baby elephants, unlicensed guns, tranquillizer

equipment, and ammunition have been at their disposal. Evidence presented to the respective

Committee of Inquiry has revealed that the culprits use several methods to capture and

transport baby elephants from the jungle.

In summary, several Petitioners argue that under the given circumstances, Regulation 5(2)

allows the registration of an elephant in a purported owner's custody that wasn't registered by

the date these Regulations took effect, following the format of Schedule III. This, according

to the Petitioners, undermines the absolute prohibition stipulated in section 22A (1) of the

FFPO, which clearly and explicitly forbids the ownership, custody, or use of an elephant

unless it is registered and a license has been obtained as per the provisions of the FFPO.

Another important argument of the Petitioners is that it is mandatory under the FFPO to have

the Registration as well as a license to lawfully and legitimately own and have in custody an

elephant. The learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner in CA/Writ/420/2021 relies on

section 22A (6) in support of the above argument. In terms of the provisions of the said section

22A (6) when a person becomes the owner, or obtains the custody, of an elephant by virtue

of sale, gift, the death of the previous owner or in any other manner whatsoever, such person

shall immediately inform the Director or prescribed officer. If the elephant is registered or

licensed, steps should be taken to have the previous registration and license cancelled and to

have a fresh registration made and a fresh license obtained.

Page 38 of 69

The contention of the Petitioners in respect of Regulation 6(2) of the impugned Regulations

is that it is contrary to section 22A of the FFPO to the extent that such provisions enable

unlawful regularization of the fraudulent possession of elephants by retroactive registration.

In essence, a person cannot have ownership of an elephant based only on a license in terms

of the said section 22A and it is essential that such registration should be recorded in the

prescribed Register of Elephants maintained by the Director General of Wildlife

Conservation. Thus, a person can obtain an annual license from the prescribed Officer upon

payment of the prescribed license fee in terms of section 22A (5) once such registration is

recorded in the said Registry of Elephants.

Challenging Regulations 6(3),7(1) and 8 of those Regulations, the Petitioners contend that the

power of registration of elephants and issuance of licenses under section 22A of the FFPO

shifts to a committee comprising of external entities such as politicians, bureaucrats and even

private parties who are not contemplated under the law. The Petitioners argue that the

statutory functions by which the law has exclusively vested in the Director General of Wildlife

Conservation have been replaced by incorporating a committee as prescribed in those

impugned Regulations.

Objections Raised by the Respondents

One of the main objections raised on behalf of the Respondents is that the Petitioners cannot

maintain the instant Applications due to lack of necessary parties. Similarly, objections have

been raised on locus standi of the Petitioners and also on the basis that the Petitioners have

come to Court with unclean hands.

The 41st Respondent of the case bearing No. CA/Writ/420/2021 argue that in the event the

Petitioners impugned the order dated 06.09.2021 of the learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo

and the learned Magistrate of Matale (I intend to deal extensively about those Magistrates

Court cases later in this Judgement), the Added Respondents are necessary parties and

accordingly, such Added Respondents should have been named as Respondents/ Parties at

the very outset. Further, the said 41st Respondent submits that the failure to name him and

the other owners and/or custodians to whom the elephants were released is a non-curable

Page 39 of 69

error. Thus, the said Respondent, particularly moves the application bearing No.

CA/Writ/420/2021 etc., be dismissed.

The said 41st Respondent argues that only the 41st to 50th added Respondents (of

CA/Writ/420/2021) were added as Respondents and anyhow, the Petitioners have failed to

name the following owners and/or custodians to whom the respective elephants were ordered

to be released by the learned Magistrates of Colombo and Matale:

1) Dilshan Wickramarathne Gunasekera - (Ref. -Elephant Registration No.200)

2) S.M. Roshan - (Ref. -Elephant Registration No.209)

3) N.G. Rajapaksha - (who claimed the elephant through a sannasa)

4) K.G. Thilakarathna - (name mentioned in the case of the Magistrates Court of

Matale)

The learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who appears for the 1st to 40th Respondents in

CA/Writ/420/2021 and the respective Respondents in the other three cases raises objections,

inter alia, on the aspect of not adding the necessary parties. The learned DSG asserts that

none of the owners of the elephants who were subjected to the relevant Magistrates Court

case as well as the respective learned Magistrates have been named as parties in the instant

Applications.

It is observed that all intervenient Petitioners who sought to intervene in the instant

Applications were duly added as party Respondents with the consent of the Petitioners.

Hence, the contention of those Respondents that the respective purported owners or the

custodians of the elephants subjected to the relevant Magistrates Court cases were not parties

at the time of filling the instant application cannot be considered reasonable. All the

intervenient Petitioners who sought to intervene participated in these proceedings effectively

as Added Respondents. As such, I cannot assume any substantial prejudice was caused to

these Added Respondents.

It is noted that two of the persons among the above-mentioned individuals highlighted by the

said 44th Respondent are named as Added Respondents in one or more of the instant

Applications. The above-named Dilshan Wickramarathne Gunasekera is the 9th Respondent

of the CA/ Writ/ 423/2021 and the 15th Respondent in the CA/Writ/433/2021 as well.

Page 40 of 69

Whereas S.M. Roshan is the 18th Respondent in CA/Writ/433/2021 and the 12th Respondent

in CA/Writ/423/2021.

The parties in all 4 Applications have already invited this Court to pronounce one Judgment

in respect of all these cases and this Court accordingly needs to take cognizance of the facts

and circumstances of all 4 cases in arriving at a final determination. Therefore, I cannot

assume that any substantial prejudice has been caused to any of the parties or that a blatant

violation of the Rule of Natural Justice exists which compels this Court to dismiss these

Applications solely on such objections.

In Gulam Hussain Ali Asgar Shabbir and Others v. LOLC Finance PLC and Another

(CA/WRIT/181/2024) decided on 05.04.2024 I have extensively dealt with the issue of not

making a judicial officer a party in a review application. It was held in the said Order that;

..........the non-inclusion of the judicial officer who issued the impugned order cannot always be

considered a fatal defect to dismiss in limine an application for judicial review and such non-

inclusion cannot be an obstacle to a comprehensive adjudication of the matter. In any case,

designating the judicial officer in question as a party respondent will be essential if there is a

specific allegation, personal or otherwise, made against him/her. If such accusations are made

against the judicial officer whose order is being challenged by the writ application, then the said

judicial officer should be allowed to present a defense or furnish essential material to the Court of

Appeal. It is crucial to ensure that no name of a person or an institution is merely included in the

caption of a writ application as a superficial addition, especially when the active engagement of

that party in the proceedings is highly unwarranted.

The Court further decided in the said case that the caption of a writ application should not

include ceremonial figures or serve as a mere list of witnesses, nor should it be exploited

for collateral purposes, such as aligning with the Petitioner's stance. In my view, it is not

ethical for a judicial officer to take one side in a review application when an order of such a

judicial officer is challenged in a review application. It was further decided that the inclusion

of a judicial officer as a party respondent in a prerogative writ should be determined by the

Court of Appeal based on the substantive and ancillary details as well as the circumstances of

each case. The degree of involvement or challenge directed at the judicial officer concerning

Page 41 of 69

either the judicial order itself or their conduct needs to be taken into consideration when the

Court of Appeal deals with an objection on necessary parties concerning a judicial officer.

Another objection raised by some of the Respondents is that the Petitioners of the instant

Applications have no locus standi to maintain these Review Applications before this Court.

The Petitioners have declared that they have intended for a Public Interest litigation (PIL).

PIL is aimed at addressing issues that affect the larger community or societal interests and it

generally intends to address matters that impact the public at large, such as environmental

protection, human rights, and social justice. Review Courts in our Country and outside our

jurisdiction taking a positive approach has relaxed the traditional rules on locus standi. The

PIL has often led to an active role for the judiciary in shaping public policy and ensuring that

government actions comply with constitutional and legal standards. The Respondents, in my

view, have failed to establish a reasonable ground for this Court to deviate from the current

developments of the law regarding the PIL and dismiss these Applications based on standing.

Based on the circumstances of these cases I am compelled to put all the other objections such

as a.) application is misconceived in law b.) reliefs sought are vague and ambiguous c.)

petitioners are guilty of suppression and misrepresentation into a basket of stereo-typed

traditional objections. This is due to the reason that, in my view, the Respondents have failed

to establish the worthiness of such objections amidst the special circumstances of the instant

Applications. Furthermore, the Respondents have failed to adduce any reasonable evidence

to establish that the Petitioners have come to this Court with unclean hands or with ulterior

motives/ malice.

Thus, I proceed to overrule all the alleged preliminary objections raised by various

Respondents as the questions that need to be resolved by this Court in these cases are aimed

at addressing issues that affect the larger community, societal interests or a set of animals who

cannot raise a voice in court.

Primary Submissions of the Respondents

The learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who appears for all State Officials in all 4

Applications, in addition to the objections raised on the maintainability of these Applications,

submits that all measures have been taken in Part I of the impugned Regulations to prevent

Page 42 of 69

commercial exploitation regarding tamed elephants and such has been further assured by

amending the long title of the FFPO.

The learned DSG contends that the inquiry against the perpetrators in reference to tampering

with the Register of Elephants maintained by the Director General of Wildlife Conservation

was pending and several issues had cropped up due to the incomplete Register since 2015. It

must be stressed that the Register of Elephant ( ) was summoned by this Court on

our own motion and at that time it was under the custody of the Registrar of the High Court

of Colombo. Both my brother and I perused the said Register and the Registrar of this Court

subsequently was ordered to return it to the Registrar of the High Court of Colombo. It is

noted that none of the Respondents have tendered to court any acceptable evidence of

tampering with the said Register and thus, such alleged assertions have become a mere blanket

application without focusing on the elephants who were subjected to the relevant cases in the

respective Magistrates Courts.

She asserts that the impugned Regulations were published as no adequate measures were

available in the previous set of regulations published in 1991 for the protection and well-being

of the tamed elephants. The learned DSG's perspective is that if this Court decides to quash

the impugned Regulations, there will be no regulations in place for the protection, well-being,

and registration of tamed elephants, as the previous regulations have not only been rescinded

but were also never approved by Parliament. Another key argument of the leaned DSG is that

the Petitioners are not entitled to challenge the orders of the respective Magistrates Court

under the provisions of Article 140 of the Constitution.

Several learned Counsel who appears for the Respondents other than the State officials have

not made submissions justifying the issuance of the impugned Regulations and its alleged

legality. Those Respondents mainly contend that they have not been identified as suspects in

the relevant Magistrates Court cases and are not liable for any offense under the FFPO. The

inference that attempted to be made particularly by the added Respondents is that the

elephants subjected to the respective Magistrates Court cases have not been captured from

the jungle.

Page 43 of 69

Those Added Respondents also raise objections on the maintainability of the instant

Applications as stated above.

Merits of the Submissions of the Petitioners and Respondents on the provisions of Part II of the

impugned Regulations

The attention of this Court has been drawn to the Cabinet papers marked 1R1 to 1R8(B)

(tendered to Court by the learned Deputy Solicitor General), particularly to the Cabinet paper

marked 1R3(a) wherein the late Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, who was the then Minister

of Wildlife submitted a Cabinet Paper under the heading Regulating Tamed Elephants and

Addressing Issues Arising Out of the Pending Cases. Subsequently, the Cabinet appointed a

subcommittee headed by then Minister Sarath Amunugama [Vide - 1R3(c)]. The Cabinet

then directed the Secretary to the Ministry of Wildlife to seek the advice of the Attorney

General in settling the cases related to these elephants.

Subsequently, by way of the Memorandum marked 1R5(a) the Minister of Wildlife sought

permission of the Cabinet inter alia to release the elephants as soon as possible with the

intervention of the Attorney General by taking suitable action in reference to cases filed by

the CID and the elephants who are the productions in those respective cases [Vide -proposal

in Clause 3.1(I)]. The Cabinet by its decision dated 14.01.2020 [1R5(b)] granted approval

inter alia for the proposal at 3.1(I) of the Memorandum, directing the Secretary of Wildlife to

formulate a suitable mechanism in association with the relevant authorities, to permit those

who could and are willing to look after the tamed elephants, under the supervision of the

Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Department of National Zoological Gardens.

In addition, a further Memorandum dated 12.03.2021 marked 1R7(a) was submitted by

Hon. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the then Prime Minister and the then Minister of Wildlife and

Forest Conservation. The Cabinet by its decision dated 15.03.2021 marked 1R7(b) granted

approval for the proposals contained in Clauses 4.1 and 4.3 of the said Memorandum and

advised that necessary action should be taken to reach an amicable settlement in the pending

Court cases with the assistance of the Secretary to the Ministry of Public Security and the

Attorney General. Accordingly, the Minister of Wildlife was entrusted with the task of

preparing a methodology to register again in a formal manner all tamed elephants to whom

Page 44 of 69

licenses and sannas had been given and those without licenses at that time. Clause 4.2 of the

said 1R7(a) specifically provides that all cases of legal action taken at present should be

withdrawn and handed over those animals to their purported present owners according to

the conditions of transferring those animals.

Thereafter, a further Memorandum was submitted by the then Minister of Wildlife and Forest

Conservation dated 12.08.2021 marked 1R9(a) recommending the orders regulating the

protection, welfare and registration of tamed elephants made under section 22A read with

section 71 of the FFPO. In reference to said Memorandum 1R9(a), the Cabinet by its

decision dated 17.08.2023 granted approval to publish the Fauna and Flora (Protection,

Well-being and Regularization of Registration of Tamed Elephants) Regulations. As a

result, the Gazette Extraordinary No. 2241/41 which contains the impugned Regulations was

published on 19.08.2021.

The efforts taken by the Cabinet of Ministers to introduce the impugned Regulations include

regulatory changes to resolve pending court cases, directing the Ministry of Wildlife to seek

even the Attorney General's advice on resolving or withdrawing criminal cases involving

tamed elephants, and facilitating the registration of unlicensed tamed elephants. This

approach raises concerns about disregarding legal principles and statutory mandates, as it

seems to prioritize quickly resolving pending cases over adhering to legal compliance.

On the other hand, the impugned Regulations have been made purportedly under section 71

of the FFPO. In terms of the said section 71(1), the Minister may make Regulations for the

purpose of carrying out or giving effect to the principles and provisions of the said FFPO. In

particular and without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by the above section

71(1), the Minister may make regulations in view of 71(2) for or in respect of all or any of the

following matters: -

(a) the circumstances in which and the conditions subject to which the Director may exercise the

powers conferred on him by section 55,

(b) the circumstances in which and the conditions subject to which any licence or permit may be

issued free of charge;

Page 45 of 69

(c) the fee to be paid for any licence or permit issued under this Ordinance or under any regulation,

and the mode and manner of payment or recovery of any such fee;

(d) the prohibition or regulation of the import, manufacture, sale, possession or use of any head-

constructed so as to be capable of being fitted into any head-gear;

(e) the period of office of the members of the advisory committee appointed under section 70, the

manner in which meetings of that committee shall be convened, the procedure to be followed at

such meetings, and the manner in which the recommendations of that committee shall be made;

(f) the declaration of any period other than that specified in section 72 as a close season in respect

of any particular species of bird or beast either throughout the whole of Sri Lanka or in any

specified area;

(g) the establishment and administration the Wildlife Preservation Fund and the purposes for

which that Fund may be employed ; and

(h) all matters for which regulations are required or authorised to be made under this Ordinance,

all matters stated or required by this Ordinance to be prescribed, and all other matters incidental

to or connected with such matters.

Regulations are often referred to as secondary or delegated legislation. Such regulations derive

their legality from the enabling statute which delegates specific powers to an authorized

person to promulgate detailed rules necessary for the effective implementation and

administration of the Act of Parliament. This delegation is generally meant for flexibility and

expertise in the legislative process enabling wider and technical provisions which need to be

addressed without direct intervention of the whole legislature. When the enabling statute

prescribes the procedure for making regulations, compliance with such procedural

requirements is essential for the legality of the regulations. In an application for judicial

review, the Review Court has the power to invalidate regulations that exceed the powers

granted by the respective Act of Parliament. It is mandatory that the regulations must be

consistent with the primary legislation and the delegatee, who is empowered to make

regulations, cannot alter, amend or override the provisions of the enabling statute. The

promulgation of rules should be guided by the intent of the legislature as specifically expressed

Page 46 of 69

in the respective statute and such power to promulgate the rules is strictly limited to the scope

and the authority granted by the enabling statute.

In the first place, the attention should be drawn to the argument of the Petitioners that the

impugned Regulations violate the Constitution of Sri Lanka, FFPO, and the Offences Against

Public Property Act of 1982. The Petitioners highlight that section 22A (12) of the FFPO

designates the Sri Lankan elephant as public property, making any offense against elephants,

including unlawful possession, punishable under the Offences Against Public Property Act in

conjunction with the FFPO. The Petitioners claim that Regulation 5(2) is legally untenable

and contradicts sections 22A(7), 22A(12), and 23 of the FFPO. They also assert that

Regulation 6(2) contradicts section 22A of the FFPO and is legally indefensible. Additionally,

the Petitioners challenge Regulations 6(3) and 7(1), and raise several issues regarding

Regulation 8.

Section 22A (7) of FFPO reads:

Any person who owns, has in his custody or makes use of an elephant which is not

registered, and in respect of which a license has not been obtained in accordance with the

provisions of this section, shall be guilty of an offence and shall on conviction be liable to a fine

not less than one hundred and fifty thousand rupees and not exceeding two hundred and fifty

thousand rupees or to imprisonment of either description for a term not less than two years and

not exceeding five years or to both such fine and imprisonment.

Section 22A (12):

Any elephant which has not been registered under this section shall be presumed to be

taken or removed from the wild without lawful authority or approval and such elephants shall be

deemed to be public property. The provisions of the Offences Against Public Property Act, No. 12

of 1982 shall accordingly apply in respect of such elephants.

Section 23:

(1) Any person who is in unlawful possession of an elephant shall be guilty of an offence and shall

on conviction be liable to a fine not less than one hundred and fifty thousand rupees and not

exceeding two hundred and fifty thousand rupees or to imprisonment of either description for a

term not less than ten years and not exceeding twenty years or to both such fine and

Page 47 of 69

imprisonment; and the court may on the conviction of any such person make order for the disposal

of the elephant in respect of which the offence was committed, having regard to the rights of any

other person who may appear to the court to be lawfully entitled to the possession of such elephant-

(2) A person who is found in possession of an elephant shall be deemed to be in unlawful possession

of that elephant unless-

(a) he is the captor of that elephant under the authority of a licence issued under this

Ordinance or under any written law repealed by Ordinance No. 2 of 1937; or

(b) he is the successor in title to such captor; or

(c) he is in possession on behalf of such captor or his successor in title.

(d) he has registered and licensed the elephant in terms of section 22A of the Ordinance.

In terms of the above provisions of law any person owning, possessing, or using an

unregistered elephant without a proper license commits an offence. Possessing an elephant

unlawfully is an offence. On conviction, the person is liable to imprisonment or both. The

presumption of Illegal Capture is a paramount feature in section 22A (12). Any unregistered

elephant is presumed to be taken from the wild unlawfully. Such unregistered elephants are

deemed public property. The Court has the discretion to order the disposal of the elephant,

considering the rights of any person lawfully entitled to it.

As pointed out by some of the Petitioners the legal regime of the FFBO with regards to the

registration is only to provide in respect of the elephants

a.) who were there at the time of enacting the FFBO

b.) upon whom license were issued under section 13 of the FFPO

c.) and newborn elephants.

In this context, it is a puzzle how those impugned Regulations recognize a new class of

elephants called tamed elephant that is in the custody of an owner but has not been registered as at

the date of commencement of these regulations as narrated in Regulation 5(2). Moreover, I cannot

Page 48 of 69

find any procedure adopted in the FFPO where registration can be sanctioned for a person

who purportedly becomes an owner through a so-called sannasa.

In the circumstances, the question that arises is whether Regulation 5(2) can be promulgated

allowing the registration of an elephant that is in the custody of an owner but has not been

registered as of the date of commencement of those Regulations, whereas section 22A (1) of

the FFPO explicitly prohibits ownership, custody or use of an elephant unless it is registered

and a license has been obtained in respect of the elephant concerned by the said section

22A(1).

Regulation 6(2) does not reflect any requirement to inquire from a person who seeks belated

registration of an elephant under the said Regulation as to why the purported acquisition of

such elephant has not been reported immediately under section 22A (6) to the Director

General of Wildlife Conservation or the prescribed Officer. Further, it is observed that the

said Regulation 6(2) does not prescribe a particular form for the registration of elephants

acquired through a sannasa etc. It is observed that the Impugned Regulations 5(2) and 6(2)

enable a person who owned, had custody or made use of an unregistered elephant to

regularize their ownership through retroactive registration.

It is noted that in terms of section 22A, only an owner or custodian can seek registration of

elephants and the category of persons stipulated in impugned Regulation 5(1) do not fall into

the category of a person who owns or has in his custody an elephant. It is a vital factor to

disclose how the elephant came into the custody of the person who seeks registration.

I am convinced with the contention of the Petitioners that no person can possess an elephant

without a license and registration provided the registration of elephants was duly carried out

as provided for under the FFPO and the register of elephants was duly maintained.

Further, the Petitioners claim that the impugned Regulations are intended to benefit those

who are subject to the law and who remain liable for prosecution and punishment under the

FFPO and the Offenses Against Public Property Act. However, section 13 of the FFPO

provides for certain steps to be taken by the Director General of Wildlife Conservation

whenever it appears to him that in any area outside a National Reserve damage to any person

or any house, crop, plantation or other property is likely to be caused by any elephant.

Page 49 of 69

Further, it provides that the Director may issue licenses subject to conditions to capture

elephants as described in section 13(1)(a). Section 17(2) provides that the elephant killed or

taken under section 13 is not the property of any person.

On perusal of the aforesaid provisions of the FFPO, the fundamental requisite of the said

FFPO is to keep the Director General of Wildlife Conservation informed forthwith about any

acquisition of an elephant by way of any means including a sale, gift, or death of the owner.

Section 13(1)(b) reads:

whenever it appears to the Director that there is serious danger to life or property in the area

referred to in subsection (1) (a), he may issue licences subject to such conditions as he may deem

necessary or expedient either free or on payment of the prescribed fee or of such fee not exceeding

the prescribed fee, if any, as he may consider adequate, authorizing the licensee to shoot, kill or

take the elephant as the case may be, within that area while the declaration is in force.

It's crucial to recognize that there are allegations that these elephant owners/custodians

acquired and tamed their elephants purportedly through illegal poaching. Consequently,

while the impugned Regulations provide another opportunity for owners of tamed elephants

to register their elephants, effectively legalizing their ownership, the Petitioners contend that

this unfairly provides another chance to legitimize their ownership over wild elephants which

they had previously illegally captured and tamed. Furthermore, the Petitioners contend that

as per the provisions of the Ordinance, wild elephants, not rightfully registered are recognized

as public property, and thus it is unreasonable to legitimize the ownership of these elephants

to individuals who had previously claimed unlawful private ownership over them.

The Petitioners further contend that the Added Respondents sought registration and license

for their elephants retroactively under the impugned Regulations subsequent to the arrest

and/or seizure of the elephants (subjected to the relevant Magistrates Court cases) by the

Director General of Wildlife Conservation based on unlawful ownership or possession. The

Petitioners also argue that several Added Respondents, who are being charged under the

FFPO by the Magistrate Court/High Court for illegal custody and possession, are now

seeking to register and license the elephant following the issuance of the gazette notification

Page 50 of 69

containing the impugned Regulations. According to the Petitioners, it is an attempt to avoid

ongoing criminal prosecution, which has not been definitively concluded.

As per the case of Bombay Dyeing & Mfg. Co. Ltd. (3) v Bombay Environmental Action Group,

(2006) 3 SCC 434, 486-87 (para 10), the amendments in regulations must be construed in

furtherance of the legislative policy and not in derogation thereof. But while doing so, the past

experience of the state which paved the necessities for modifying the earlier regulation should

not be forgotten. Furthermore, In International Spirits & Wines Association of India v. State of

Haryana (2019) 20 SCC 284 it was held that:

where authority empowered to make rules regarding grant of liquor license is

the State government under the Act this power could not be altered through any rules

or regulations. The power granted under Punjab Excise Act, 1914 to the Finance

Commissioner is only a regulatory power and available only after liquor license has

been granted. This power to regulate supply, storage or sale of any intoxicant for the

entire State could not mean grant of liquor license for any "local area" under the Act.

Grant of liquor license is different from regulation of liquor license. Amendment of

Rules by the Finance Commissioner assuming power to determine the number of

licenses will be unreasonable and unsustainable. (Vide - M.P.Jain & S.N.Jain;

Principles of Administrative Law, 9th Edition, 2022)

In light of the reasons given above, I hold that Regulations 5(1), 5(2), 6(1), 6(2), 6(3), 7(1),

7(2) and 7(3) of Part II of the impugned Regulations are not aligned with the provisions of the

FFPO, and the delegatee authorized to promulgate regulations under the FFPO has changed,

amended, or override the basic provisions of the said enabling statute. The Regulations 5(1),

5(2), 6(1), 6(2), 6(3), 7(1), 7(2) and 7(3) have been unlawfully promulgated usurping the power

to make regulations and without confining to the scope and authority granted by the FFPO.

Accordingly, I take the view that Regulations 5(1), 5(2), 6(1), 6(2), 6(3), 7(1), 7(2) and 7(3)

are liable to be quashed. Anyhow I am not inclined to quash the rest of the Regulations in the

said Part II of the Regulations based on the legal framework adopted by me to arrive at the

above conclusion. I am not convinced with the submissions made on behalf of the State

Officials to justify the above Regulations which need to be quashed.

Page 51 of 69

However, I have a reasonable doubt as to how the impugned regulations as prescribed in

Regulation 15 declare that the licence fee or licence renewal fee should be credited to the

Wildlife Conservation Fund without adhering to the rules/law relating to the government

revenue of the country. None of the Petitioners have substantially challenged the said

regulation and no adequate submissions have been made upon the same. Therefore, this

Court is unable to make any determination on the said Regulation 15.

Merits of the Submissions of the Petitioners and Respondents on the provisions of Part I of the

impugned Regulations

The Petitioners in CA/Writ/423/2021 and CA/Writ/431/2021 challenge inter alia, the

provisions of Part I of the impugned Regulations. The learned Presidents Counsel for the

Petitioner in CA/Writ/431/2021 referring to the long title of the FFPO submits that any and

all commercial uses of Fauna and Flora shall be deemed to be misuses in terms of FFPO. He

further submits that not even tamed/domesticated elephants can be used for commercial

purposes and such a position is corroborated by the fact that the FFPO does not recognize or

provide for any permitted commercial uses. The learned Counsel for the Petitioners in

CA/Writ/423/2021 submitted that although the intended effect of the FFPO is inter alia the

prevention of the commercial and other misuses of the Fauna and Flora, the impugned

Regulations have permitted elephants to be used for tourism, tourist safari rides, towing

vehicles, transporting timber, for cinema shooting or any other similar activities.

For clarity and better adjudication, I must reproduce the provisions which need to be adhered

to by every person who owns or has in custody an elephant according to Part I of the

impugned Regulations.

(a) when such elephant behaves violently and abnormally not obeying the commands of the

mahout due to musth or any other cause, reasonable steps using minimum force in keeping with

the traditional methods shall be taken to control such elephant, in order to prevent any damage

caused to such elephant or to the life of the mahout of such elephant or to any other person or

property. Any harmful drug or material which causes unnecessary pain or oppression shall not

be used to control such elephant and if any anesthetic drug is injected to such elephant, such drug

shall be injected only with the directions of a Veterinary Surgeon;

(ii) Director-General of Department of National Zoological Gardens or his

representative;

(iii) a Veterinary Surgeon nominated by the Director-General of Department of Animal

Production and Health;

(iv) Registered Traditional Doctor who treats elephants nominated by the Secretary to

the Ministry of the Minister assigned the subject of Indigenous Medicine; and

(v) the chairperson, secretary or the treasurer of the Tamed elephants Owners'

Organization;

(y) A trained and experienced mahout shall be engaged to take care of such elephant and such

person who owns or has the custody of an elephant and the person who owns or has the custody

such tusk or tush it shall be informed to the Director-General and shall be duly recorded in the

data sheet and get such record endorsed by the Director-General Wildlife when the permit in

respect of tamed elephants is renewed.

On perusal of the above Regulations, it emanates that the expressed intention of such

Regulations is to ensure the welfare and safety of elephants when they are under human care,

as well as the safety of the mahouts, the public, and property. The regulations mandate that

elephants, especially when behaving violently or under musth, should be controlled using

Page 57 of 69

minimal force and traditional methods to avoid unnecessary pain or oppression. Certain

requirements are provided in those Regulations for the transportation of elephants, including

vehicle specifications, duration limits, and speed limits to ensure safe and humane transport.

Similarly, in terms of Regulation 2(r) and 2(s), elephants must be allowed sufficient time to

sleep, especially young elephants under five years old and only traditional tools with specific

standards are allowed for training and control, prohibiting other sharp weapons and

anesthetics to prevent harm.

The question that arises here is whether those Regulations override the provisions of FFPO.

I have already dealt with the impugned Regulations in Part II comparing them with the

provisions of the enabling statute. I am unable to find any implicit violation of the provisions

of the FFPO by promulgating Regulation 2(a) to 2(z) in Part I of the impugned Regulations.

The Respondent's primary contention against the said Regulations 2(a) to 2(z) is that those

provisions encourage using elephants for commercial purposes etc. I do not intend to reject

bluntly such contentions of the Respondents as I need further deliberations and more evidence

upon such elements.

I am unable to ignore the fact that several tamed elephants are in the custody of private

individuals and State authorities. I am aware that those tamed elephants are currently being

used for religious processions and the promotion of tourism by private owners etc. Anyhow,

my fervent view is that any kind of safety and welfare of those tamed elephants upon whom

due licenses have been issued should not be hindered until a public policy is taken by the

authorities to allow those tamed elephants to continue to be under private owners/State or

release all of them to the wild. This Court has no expertise in examining the psychology and

physiology of a tamed elephant who is in the custody of a private owner/State. Further, a

reasonable doubt arises as to whether favorable steps would be taken by the authorities or the

politicians in respect of the existing set of tamed elephants who are duly registered and

licensed in the Country in the event this Court was to quash the Regulations reflected in Part

I of the impugned Regulations. Hence, I am not inclined to disturb the existence of

Regulations 2(a) to 2(z) in Part I of the impugned Regulations at this stage.

Decisions of the Learned Magistrates

The Petitioners in the Applications bearing No. CA/Writ/423/2021 and

CA/Writ/433/2021 inter alia, seek an Order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing

the Order dated 06.09.2021 of the learned Magistrate of the Chief Magistrates Court of

Colombo in case No. B23073/01/15 (P14 in CA/Writ/423/2021 and X5 in

CA/Writ/433/2021) and the Order dated 06.09.2021 of the learned Magistrate of

Magistrates Court of Matale in the case bearing No. B941/14 (P15 in CA/Writ/423/2021).

Further, the Petitioners in CA/Writ/433/2021 seek a mandate in the nature of a Writ of

Prohibition, prohibiting the learned Chief Magistrate of the Magistrates Court of Colombo

from making an order to hand over any elephant inclusive of elephant-bearing Registration

No. 206, presently in judicial and/or State custody, to anybody. Further, the Petitioners in

CA/Writ/423/2021 seek an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing and/or

compelling the Director General of Wildlife Conservation, Criminal Investigations

Department (CID), Inspector General of Police and the Hon. Attorney General to prosecute

all individuals who are/were possessing elephants which have not been lawfully registered in

terms of section 22A of FFPO or any regulations made thereunder.

The CID reported facts to the Chief Magistrates Court of Colombo under the case bearing

No. B23073/01/15 and to the Magistrates Court of Matale under the case bearing No.

B941/14 upon unlawful possession of the elephants subjected to the said cases. Based on a

further report filed by the CID, the learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo has released the

elephants mentioned in the said P14 to the purported registered owners/custodians. It is

paramount to note that the learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo and the learned Magistrate

of Matale have made those orders based on the impugned Regulations, particularly under the

guise of Regulations 5(1) or 5(2). This position is evinced on the face of the record as per the

order marked X5. On a careful perusal of P15 it is observed that the learned Magistrate of

Matale also released the elephants subjected to the respective case to the purported

owners/custodians based on the aforesaid Regulations.

The learned Presidents counsel who appears for the Petitioners in CA/Writ/433/2021 made

submissions drawing the attention of this Court to the provisions of sections 124 and 431 of

Page 59 of 69

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (No. 15 of 1979). He submitted that once an order is

made under section 25 of the FFPO no further steps can be taken in respect of the elephant.

Further, he submitted that the impugned order of the learned Magistrate had been issued

under section 431 of the said Code of Criminal Procedure Act; but the learned Magistrate has

no jurisdiction to make the said impugned order which is ex facie wrong.

At this stage, I must closely examine the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers referred to

above and the background to it as reflected in the documents tendered to the Court. It appears

that such Cabinet Memorandums and Decisions allegedly suggest a concerted effort to

address legal and regulatory challenges surrounding the ownership and management of tamed

elephants subjected to those cases. However, it is pertinent to note that such an alleged effort

appears to have multiple layers, including regulatory changes aimed at resolving pending

court cases. In the process of settlement of Pending Cases, the Cabinet has directed the

Ministry of Wildlife to seek the Attorney General's advice/assistance to resolve the criminal

cases involving tamed elephants or to withdraw such cases. A significant component of the

Cabinet's strategy paved the way for the registration of tamed elephants, including those

without licenses. A reasonable question arises as to whether the emphasis on reaching

amicable settlements in pending court cases and the directive to withdraw such criminal cases

reflect a motive to encourage the authorities to override the legal provisions of FFPO.

I take the view that the Cabinet of Ministers' decisions regarding the regularization of the

registration of tamed elephants reveal a significant disregard for legal principles and statutory

mandates. The concerted effort to settle pending criminal proceedings or to withdraw such

cases without a solid legal foundation, as evidenced by the documents presented, raises

significant concerns about the rule of law and adherence to established legal principals. The

Cabinet's directive to the Ministry of Wildlife to seek the Attorney General's advice for settling

cases related to tamed elephants, rather than allowing these cases to proceed through the

judicial system, undermines the integrity of the legal process. This approach suggests a

preference for expediency over justice, potentially compromising the fair adjudication of

criminal cases.

Page 60 of 69

I take the view that the decision to regularize the registration of tamed elephants, including

those without current licenses, through administrative mechanisms rather than through strict

legal compliance, directly contravenes the FFPO. The FFPO is designed to protect wildlife

through stringent regulations, and any attempt to bypass its provisions undermines its purpose

and effectiveness. The Cabinet's actions lack a reasonable legal basis, as they prioritize the

swift resolution of cases over adherence to the statutory framework. The absence of a vigorous

legal justification for these decisions suggests an ulterior motive that prioritizes the interests

of certain individuals or groups over the principles of justice and legal consistency.

By allowing tamed elephants to be handed over to their purported "present owners" without

thorough legal scrutiny, the Cabinet has opened the doors to potential abuses. These decisions

could enable individuals to retain or acquire elephants without proper authorization,

encouraging illegal possession and exploitation of these elephants. In summary, the Cabinet's

decisions to settle ongoing legal proceedings regarding tamed elephants without reasonable

legal grounds and in violation of the main statute represent a questionable departure from the

principles of justice and the Rule of Law. Any action taken under the impugned Regulations

5(1), 5(2), 6(1) and 6(2), not only undermines the judicial process but also poses a significant

threat to the protection and welfare of wildlife as mandated by the FFPO.

In addition to the above, I cannot possibly overlook the substance of paragraph 42 of the

Written Submissions of the Petitioners in the case bearing No. 423/2021 which reads;

It is respectfully submitted that as a part of this illegal racket elephant calves are captured from

the wild in secret, kept hidden away in the forest till they can be transported surreptitiously by

some vehicle, and maintaining in secrecy till they are tamed without any proper care or facilities

probably causing much greater mortality in these calves.

(Copies of newspaper articles in proof are marked as "P10(a)" to "P10(d) to the Petition).

A copy of the Research paper titled "Illegal capture and internal trade of wild Asian elephants

(Elephas maximus) in Sri Lanka" published on November 3rd in the Nature Conservation

Journal is marked as "P11 (a)" to the Petition.

Several Respondents made assertions on the submissions made by the learned Deputy

Solicitor General (who appeared before the Magistrates Court in Colombo) on 16.09.2021 in

the Magistrates Court of Colombo in the case bearing No. B23073/01/15 to emphasize the

fact that the investigations against several Added Respondents have been concluded due to

the lack of adequate evidence. The learned DSG has submitted to Court that the elephants

subjected to the said case have not been found from forest or other places (the said learned

DSG submitted in Sinhala language as follows:

.). I am not inclined to embrace

such submissions of the learned DSG in a situation where the impugned Regulations have

been published as a result of the Cabinet Decision to resolve or withdraw the pending cases.

Similarly, I simply cannot believe the version of the CID reflected in the final B Report filed

in the respective Magistrates Courts seeking an order to release the elephants based on no

evidence.

The below-mentioned paragraph of His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva (with the

concurrence of His Lordship Justice E.A.G.R. Amarasekara and Her Ladyship Justice

K.K.Wickremasinghe) reflected in the Order dated 01.12.2021 [ 1R8(b)] in the case bearing

No. SC (FR) 109/2021. (The aforementioned Cabinet Memorandum marked 1R7(a) has

been challenged in the said Supreme Court in the said case; However, the Supreme Court has

refused granting leave in the said Case upon reasons not known to this Court.)

The Attorney-General is vested with extensive statutory powers in relation to criminal

investigations and prosecutions. Such powers are held in public trust. They must be exercised for

the due administration of justice according to the rule of law which is the basis of our

Constitution. Any type of dictation from whatever quarter will compromise the independence of

the Attorney-General unless such dictation is permitted by law. Any compromise of the

independence of the Attorney-General will have a negative impact on the rule of law. The heart

of the Petitioners' complaint is that the 1st and 2nd Respondents and the Cabinet of Ministers are

interfering with the statutory powers of the Attorney General.

This is a serious allegation, which if true, has far reaching ramifications. According to Article

4(d) of the Constitution, it is the bounden duty of this Court to secure and advance the

fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. These are proceedings brought on behalf of

Page 62 of 69

the public at large. I hold that this Court must not allow procedural defects of the nature alleged

in this matter to shackle its constitutional duty to examine the allegation of the Petitioners at the

leave to proceed stage. Accordingly, l overrule the third objection. I allow the amended petition

dated 16th August 2021.

I have already concluded that Regulations 5(1), 5(2), 6(1), 6(2), 6(3), 7(1), 7(2) and 7(3) have

been unlawfully promulgated usurping the power to make regulations and without confining

to the scope and authority granted by the FFPO and accordingly, those Regulations 5(1), 5(2),

6(1), 6(2), 6(3), 7(1), 7(2) and 7(3) are liable to be quashed.

In this backdrop, I now advert to examine the legality of the impugned Orders of the learned

Magistrates of Colombo and Matale. As emphasized above in detail, the said learned

Magistrates issued those impugned Orders based on such Regulations 5(1) and/or 5(2).

At this stage, it is important to draw my attention to the judgement in Kelani Valley Plantations

PLC (formerly Kelani Valley Plantations Limited) v. Chairman of the National Housing

Development Authority Others S.C. Appeal No. 70/2015 decided on 03.04.2024. The Supreme

Court in addition to the main issue has considered whether the Gazette Notification subjected

to the said case (No.1145/19) can be impugned within its proceedings by way of a collateral

challenge. His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva (concurring with Their Lordships Justice

Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C. and Justice Arjuna Obeyesekere) in the said case has referred to

Rajakulendran v. Wijesundera (1 Sriskanthas Law Reports 164 at 168) and Bandahamy v.

Senanayake (62 NLR 313) in which cases, the statement made by Lord Denning in Macfoy v.

United Africa Company Limited [(1961) 3 All E.R. 1169 at 1172] have been adopted. In the said

Macfoy case, Lord Denning has stated:

If an act is void, then it is in law a nullity. It is not only bad, but incurably bad. There

is no need for an order of the court to set it aside. It is automatically null and void without

more ado, though it is sometimes convenient to have the court declare it to be so. And

every proceeding which is founded on it is also bad and incurably bad. You cannot put

something on nothing and expect it to stay there. It will collapse.

Page 63 of 69

However, His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva has observed,

Nevertheless, the position in English law is different. This was examined by a divisional bench

of 5 judges in the Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill Special Determination

[Decisions of the Supreme Court on Parliamentary Bills, 2021, Vol. XVI, page 23 at 33]

where it was held:

However, Court observes that Clive Lewis, Judicial Remedies in Public Law, 5th ed.,

South Asian Edition (2017) in discussing the meaning of null and void in

Administrative Law states (page 185):

The primary concern here is the meaning of nullity or voidness solely in the

context of the remedies granted by courts. The concept of nullity has been used to

solve other problems arising in administrative law. For remedial purposes, the

orthodox view is that an ultra vires act is regarded as void and a nullity. An act

by a public authority which lacks legal authority is regarded as incapable of

producing legal effects. Once its illegality is established, and if the courts are

prepared to grant a remedy, the act will be regarded as void from its inception

and retrospectively nullified in the sense that it will be regarded as incapable of

ever having produced legal effects. (emphasis added)

In fact, Wade and Forsyth (supra, page 305), states that the statement of

Lord Denning in Macfoy v. United Africa Co. Ltd.(supra) is not the correct position of

the law. Wade and Forsyth, Administrative Law, (supra, page 304), after restating

the above statement of Lord Radcliffe states as follows:

This must be equally true even where the brand of invalidity is plainly visible

for there also the order can effectively be resisted in law only by obtaining the

decision of the court. The necessity of recourse to the court has been pointed out

repeatedly in the House of Lords and Privy Council, without distinction between

patent and latent defects. Lord Diplock spoke still more clearly [F Hoffmann-La

Roche & Co. v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) AC 295 at

366], saying that;

Page 64 of 69

It leads to confusion to use such terms as voidable, voidable ab initio,

void or a nullity as descriptive of the status of subordinate legislation alleged

to be ultra vires for patent or for latent defects, before its validity has been

pronounced on by a court of competent jurisdiction. (emphasis added)

This approach is consistent with the presumption of validity according to which

administrative action is presumed to be valid unless or until it is set aside by a court

[Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1975) AC

295]. However, this presumption of validity exists pending a final decision by the court

[Lord Hoffmann in R v. Wicks (1998) AC 92 at 115, Lords Irvine LC and Steyn in

Boddington v. British Transport Police (1999) 2 AC 143 at 156 and 161, and 173-

4].

His Lordship Justice Janak De Silva has even referred to a judgement pronounced by His

Lordship in the Court of Appeal in McCallum Brewing Company (Private) Limited v.

Commissioner General of Excise and Another [C.A. Writ 469/2008, C.A.M. 18.12.2019] where it

was held (at page 5) that an ultra vires act can be challenged in two ways including collateral

challenge. Finally, the Supreme Court for the reasons given therein, rejected the contention

of the respondent that the validity of the order published in the said Gazette Notification No.

1145/19 can be impugned in those proceedings by way of collateral challenge.

In the above circumstances, I arrive at the conclusion that the decision of the Chief

Magistrates Court of Colombo in the case bearing No. B23073/01/15 on 06.09.2021 and the

decision of the Magistrates Court of Matale in the case bearing No. B941/14 is a nullity.

Similarly, any decision taken following Regulations 5(1), 5(2), 6(1), 6(2), 6(3), 7(1), 7(2) and

7(3) by a public authority will be nullity and void ab initio. It is up to the learned Magistrate

to consider whether evidence is available against any perpetrator who was keeping the

elephants under illegal custody

Obtaining Tamed Elephants for Historical Cultural Processions

Some of the Petitioners challenge the Regulations stipulated in Part III of the impugned

Regulations which deals with obtaining tamed elephants for a historical cultural procession.

Strong concerns were raised about the Tamed Elephants Owners Organization described in

Page 65 of 69

Regulation 17 of the said Part III. I need to examine the submissions of the learned Counsels

in this regard from a broader and more realistic perspective, considering both the

circumstances of these cases and the elements of law.

Although both elephants and humans are classified as mammals, elephants, despite their

advanced capabilities and complex social behavior, cannot speak. This limitation prevents

elephants from providing verbal testimony or effectively communicating their preferences.

Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognize that changes in their behavior, movements, and

gestures can offer insights into their attempts to communicate with humans, despite their

inability to use words.

Likewise, in noting that elephants communication cannot be ascertained through words, my

attention is drawn to the following excerpt from the poem I know Why the Caged Bird Sings

by the acclaimed American poetess Maya Angelou. Even though the underlying

circumstances of the poem are in relation to the struggle of the black Americans yesteryear,

the following may be relevant;

But a bird that stalks

down his narrow cage

can seldom see through

his bars of rage

his wings are clipped and

his feet are tied

so he opens his throat to sing

When interpreting the above excerpt in its literal meaning, it suggests that, while a tame and

domesticated elephant might be restrained with chains and confined to limited spaces, the

loud trumpeting could indicate the agony and suffering the elephant experiences, in addition

to observable changes in its behavior. Therefore, although elephants cannot communicate

verbally, they certainly express themselves through their actions and sounds.

Page 66 of 69

Thus, any of the parties to these instant Applications and their respective learned Counsel or

this Court are not competent to consider whether elephants genuinely desire to a) participate

in peraheras and other cultural pageants, b) prefer to be in the custody of a private owner, c)

prefer to be in the custody of the State or d) wishes to be released to the wild. Therefore, I

must deal with the assertions in respect of the elephants by human parties who are represented

in these instant Applications under the detailed special circumstances mentioned above and

bearing in mind the scope of the power vested in this Court under Article 140 of the

Constitution.

There is widespread concern that the population of domesticated elephants is rapidly

declining, particularly due to the significant threat this poses to cultural events such as

peraheras. (I have perused the data records on present and future tamed elephants in Sri

Lanka tendered to Court by Mr. Kuvera De Zoysa, Presidents Counsel on 13.01.2023.) From

the period Kings reigned the country tame elephants have been part of the country's culture

but the numbers are declining. In the 1980s, the tame elephant population was over 500. By

1990 it was around 300. Presently, the number of tame elephants has dropped to under

hundred. There is written evidence that tame elephants were used in the construction industry

such as building tanks, building stupas and also in the timber industry.

Considering the above circumstances mentioned under the above subtopic, I cannot directly

cross off the constituting of a Tamed Elephants Owners Organization. This is merely

because the prime intention of all stakeholders should be to protect and provide welfare to

elephants. I presume that an experienced mahout (elephant herder) or a genuine private

owner of an elephant may be more aware of the likes and dislikes of an elephant than the

public officials/activists who operate from air-conditioned rooms in the town. Hence, I do

not see any grave injustice in the adoption of tame elephants by a guardian who has traditional

knowledge and experience of elephants, as well as suitable environmental conditions for an

elephant to live in. I am making all these observations on the footing that there is no current

policy decision in this country to completely disband holding the possession of a tamed

elephant by a private party. Similarly, I cannot gather any policy or a future plan which

provides protection and welfare for tamed elephants who are currently in the custody of

private owners, religious places etc.

Page 67 of 69

Based on such circumstances I am not inclined to quash the provisions of Part III of the

impugned Regulations. I am of the view that the provisions in the said Part III should be

effective until the relevant authorities promulgate detailed rules and regulations to cater to the

multiple dimensions of the tale of the correlation between humans and elephants in Sri Lanka.

It was drawn to our attention that a proposal has been made to prepare a pool of tame

elephants under the intervention of the State and provide elephants for cultural activities.

Implementation of such a decision should be done subject to stringent conditions in favor of

the protection and welfare of elephants. Based on the special circumstances of this case, such

as the inability to communicate on the part of the elephants, I need to observe that the State

parties or Government is bound to protect the Sri Lankan culture which has been in existence

since the Kings era and formulate appropriate rules in that regard for the further protection

/wellbeing of the elephants. In view of promulgating such rules and making policies, the

authorities may take cognizance of the opinions of the experts/experienced private

individuals. I take the view that amongst several recommendations, the following proposals

made by the Committee on Preservation of Wild Life, mentioned in Chapter 5 (under the

heading Our Elephants) in its report published in Sessional Paper XIX-1959, Published on

16.11.1959 are apt here:

With the immense usefulness of the elephant to man and its capacity to be domesticated, we

consider that an endeavour should be made to breed elephants in captivity or in the semi-wild

state. Money, will of course, be needed for such a purpose, but as we consider it worthwhile we

recommend that a State-aided experiment be carried out and an elephant capturing-breeding-

and-training centre be established, as suggested by the Sub-Committee referred to earlier. We

would urge that very early steps be taken to ascertain the elephant population and its distribution;

also that their migratory routes be determined with a view to confirming the jungle corridors

necessary to enable them to pass from one Reserve to another, (as indicated in Appendix 2), or be

driven along them when their haunts are threatened by agricultural encirclement.

We would also urge the banning of licences to individuals for the capturing of elephants for any

purpose. Until the Department of Wild Life is able 1to build up an organisation of expert elephant

trappers the capture of elephants should be entrusted to the Zoo working in conjunction with the

Department of Wild Life.

Page 68 of 69

.The issue of free licences for the destruction of rogue elephants should be

stopped and the control and destruction of dangerous elephants should be the function solely of

the Department of Wild Life. There is considerable abuse and cruelty under the present practice

of issuing licences to individuals for the capture of elephants as well as for the destruction of

dangerous ones. We further stress that the capture of baby elephants by private parties without

authority should be completely prohibited. In cases of baby elephants found abandoned, the

Department of Wild Life should make arrangements for taking them on.

The above committee has been appointed in December 1957 with Mr. K. Somasuntharam as

Chairman and several gentlemen including Dr. R.L. Spittel have served as members who

have commenced the said Chapter 5 stating The elephant is a pride of Ceylon.

Conclusion

I need to reiterate here that, the learned Counsel who appears for all the Petitioners and all

the Respondents in the Applications bearing Nos. CA/WRIT/420/2021,

CA/WRIT/423/2021, CA/WRIT/431/2021 and CA/WRIT/433/2021 after concluding

their oral submissions, invited this Court to pronounce a one judgement in respect of all above

4 Applications. In light of the reasons given above while also bearing in mind the special

circumstances of this Case and on a careful consideration of the whole matter, I should

exercise my discretion to issue,
