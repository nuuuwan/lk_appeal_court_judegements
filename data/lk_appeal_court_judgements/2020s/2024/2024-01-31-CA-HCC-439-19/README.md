The Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as Accused) were indicted before the

High Court of Colombo on the following four Counts under the Bribery Act.

1. Between the period of 23.12.2011 and 21.02.2012, at Kalutara within the jurisdiction

of this Court, you being a public servant to wit Superintendent of Works of the

2. At the same time, place, and in the course of the same transaction referred to in charge

under Section 19 (c) of the Bribery Act.

3. On or about 21.02.2012, at Kalutara within the jurisdiction of this Court, you being a

public servant to wit Superintendent of Works of the Kalutara Urban Council, did

accept a gratification of s.15,000/- being 5% out of the annual insurance installments

official act of handing over the insurance work pertaining to the vehicles and buildings

Page 4 of 11

4. At the same time place and in the course of the same transaction referred to in charge

03, at Kalutara within the jurisdiction of this court, you being a public servant to wit

Superintendent of Works of Kalutara Urban Council, did accept a gratification of

Rs.15,000/- being 5% out of the annual insurance installments payable to the Sri

Lanka Insurance Corporation by the Kaluthara Urban Council from Thalgaha

Withanage Ruwan Thushara and thereby committed an offence punishable under

Section 19 (c) of the Bribery Act as amended.

The prosecution led the evidence from five witnesses, marking productions P1 to P11.

On behalf of the Accused Four witnesses gave evidence and the Accused made a dock

statement, and they closed the case marking document X1.

After the trial, the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo convicted the Accused on

all four Counts,

1. For each 1st, and 2nd Counts fine of Rs.2,500/- and 2 years Simple imprisonment (

Both sentenced should run concurrently).

2. 3rd and 4th counts, fine of Rs.2,500/- and 2 years Simple imprisonment( both

sentenced should run concurrently).

In addition to the above Rs.15,000/- was imposed as a penalty under section 26 of the

Bribery Act and if in default 12 months of simple imprisonment will be imposed.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Accused preferred to

lodge a petition appeal to this Court.

The facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:

In presenting his evidence, PW01, Halgaha Withanage Ruwan Thushara, was

identified as an appointed Insurance Agent for the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation. The

Accused held the position of Works Superintendent within the Kalutara Municipal Council.

Subsequent to a meeting with the secretary, the Accused engaged with PW01. He

disclosed that Achira, the predecessor agent, had customarily allocated 5% of his commission

Page 5 of 11

from the insurance corporation as a standard practice, and anticipated that PW01 would

adhere to the same arrangement. In reciprocity, he assured the allocation of all forthcoming

insurance policies to PW01.

Upon being questioned, he revealed that 5% of the commission received from the

Insurance Corporation for insuring the cab (PB-6360) owned by the municipal council

constituted the agreed sum. As per the witness's account, this amounted to Rs. 15,000/-.

However, there was no evidence presented to elucidate the calculation of this amount.

Subsequently, PW01 filed a complaint with the Bribery Commission, leading to the

orchestration of a sting operation on the 21st of February 2012. Accompanied by an

undercover agent from the Bribery Commission, PW01 met with the Accused at a

prearranged location. Upon the Accused accepting the money, he was apprehended.

The Accused refuted any allegations of soliciting gratification. He claimed that Hon.

Luxman Wijemanna, the UNP MP for Kalutara District, harbored animosity towards him.

At that time, the Kalutara Municipal Council was under UNP's jurisdiction. It was alleged

by the Accused that Mr. Wijemanna had directed the Complainant to the Secretary of the

Kalutara Urban Council, bearing a recommendation letter from Mr. Wijemanna. The

Accused had shared his concerns about this arrangement with the Secretary.

The Accused's defense argued that this situation exacerbated the hostility between

Mr. Luxman Wijemanna and himself, leading to a contrived case against him. The plan,

according to the defense, was to solicit a loan of Rs. 15,000/- from the Accused, which he

naively extended to the Complainant. Upon repayment of this loan by the Complainant, the

Accused was arrested. In his evidence, the Accused acknowledged receiving Rs. 15,000/- from

PW01, but claimed it was in repayment of a loan.

The pivotal issue at hand is whether the Prosecution has substantiated the alleged

solicitation, which is central to Counts 1 and 2. According to these counts, the Prosecution

must demonstrate that the Accused solicited a sum equivalent to 5% of the annual insurance

premiums payable to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation by the Kalutara Urban Council

from Thalgaha Withanage Ruwan Thushara as an inducement.

Upon examining PW01's testimony, it becomes evident that he provided varying

accounts of the solicitation. Initially, he stated that the Accused demanded 5% of the

insurance commission, but later referred to the alleged bribe as 5% of the Premium.

The inconsistency in PW01's evidence was overlooked by the Learned High Court

Judge. It is a well-established principle in our courts that when a witness presents

contradictory statements in their testimony, the reliability of their evidence is compromised.

Chandra Ekanayake, J in Padmatilake (Sgt) V. Director General, Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery/Corruption 2009 2 SLR Page 151, Held that;

It has to be stressed here that credibility of prosecution witnesses should be subject

to judicial evaluation in totality and not isolated scrutiny by the Judge. When witnesses make

inconsistent statements in their evidence either at one stage of at two stages, the testimony

of such witnesses is unreliable and in the absence of special circumstances, no conviction can

be based on the testimony of such witnesses. On the other hand one cannot be unmindful of

the proposition that Court cannot mechanically reject the evidence of any witness. With

regard to appreciation of evidence in criminal cases it would be of importance to quote what

Sir John Woodroffe & Amir Ali had to say in their work on- " Law of Evidence- 18" Edition -

Vol. 1 at pg 471:-

"No hard and fast rule can be laid down about appreciation of evidence. It is after all

a question of fact and each case has to be decided on the facts as they stand in that particular

case. Where a witness makes two inconsistent statements in his evidence with regard to a

material fact and circumstance, the testimony of such a witness becomes unreliable and

unworthy of credence"

Furthermore, the Learned High Court Judge, in his judgment, did not adequately

address the issue of solicitation. According to Counts 1 and 2, the alleged solicitation involves

demanding 5% of the annual insurance installments payable to the Sri Lanka Insurance

Corporation. However, the witness's testimony pertains to 5% of his commission.

The judgment of the Learned High Court Judge lacked a thorough analysis prior to

reaching a conclusion regarding the alleged solicitation. The judgment appears to reveal an

oversight, as the Learned High Court Judge did not discuss both versions of the witness's

testimony and failed to provide reasoning for his determination. To better illustrate this

point, it is necessary to reproduce the relevant portions of the judgment.

I concur that this oversight alone is sufficient to render the judgment invalid. Further

scrutiny reveals that the prosecution has not convincingly established the element of

inducement. What were the actions undertaken by the Accused following the acceptance of

the money?

In PW01's evidence, it was indicated that the inducement by the Accused was to

provide PW01 the opportunity to insure other vehicles and buildings for the insurance

corporation. However, there is no corroborative evidence to affirm that the Accused actually

performed such an act. It is also noted that PW01 was the exclusive agent of the insurance

corporation for insuring properties related to the Municipal Council.

Given the absence of concrete evidence demonstrating that the specific sum of Rs.

15,000/- was obtained as a bribe or through corrupt means, it appears that the Learned High

Court Judge may have overlooked a crucial aspect of the offense under Section 19(c) of the

Bribery Act.

The second point of contention revolves around the calculation of the alleged bribe of

Rs. 15,000/-. Initially, in his evidence, PW01 stated that Mr. Munasinghe, on behalf of the

Accused, had requested a sum equivalent to 5% of the commission he would receive after

insuring the vehicle. However, during cross-examination, PW01 changed his statement,

indicating that the Accused had asked for 5% of the insurance premium payable to the

Insurance Corporation.

Page 10 of 11

There is no direct evidence to suggest that the Accused explicitly demanded Rs.

15,000/- as a bribe. In Counts 3 and 4, where the amount in question is Rs. 15,000/-, clear

evidence is required to prove that the Accused personally demanded this sum. There is no

evidence to indicate that he made such a demand. On the contrary, PW03 mentioned that

the amount was calculated based on the insurance premium.

Additionally, it is important to consider that the Accused claimed to have provided a

loan of Rs. 15,000/- to PW01. According to his account, the money he received from PW01 was

the repayment of this loan. The Learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate this evidence.

We are mindful of the dictum made by Rodrigo J in James Silva V The Republic of Sri

Lanka (1980) 2SLR Page 167 citing Jayasena V the Queen 72 NLR Page 313, Held that

It is a grave error of law for a trial Judge to direct himself that he must examine the

tenability and truthfulness of the evidence of the defence in the light of the evidence led by

the prosecution. Our criminal law postulates a fundamental presumption of legal innocence

of every accused till the contrary is proved. This is rooted in the concept of legal inviolability

of every individual in our society; now enshrined in our Constitution. There is not even a

surface presumption of truth in the charge with which an accused is indicted. Therefore, to

examine the evidence of the accused in the light of the prosecution witnesses is to reverse the

presumption of innocence.

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider all the

matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by the defence in its totality

without compartmentalising and, ask himself whether as a prudent man, in the

circumstances of the particular case, he believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty

- see the Privy Council Judgment in Jayasena v The Queen.

Page 11 of 11

In the instant appeal, we observe that the Learned High Court Judge did not

adequately evaluate the entirety of the evidence presented. Instead, there appears to have

been a selective consideration of portions of evidence from the entire proceedings, leading to

the conclusion that the Prosecution had substantiated its case.

I hold that the evidence led by the Prosecution is insufficient to prove the guilt of the

Accused beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, for the reasons outlined above, the judgment of

the Learned High Court Judge dated 2019.03.21 is set aside. Accordingly, this appeal is

allowed, and the convictions entered, and sentences imposed upon the accused are set aside

and he is acquitted of all charges.
