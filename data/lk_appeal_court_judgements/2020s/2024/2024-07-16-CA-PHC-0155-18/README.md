JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the Aggrieved Party-Petitioner-Appellants

(Hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) challenging the acquittal of

the Accused-Respondent-Respondent (Hereinafter referred to as the

Accused) by the judgment of the Learned Magistrate of Kurunegala

dated 29.08.2014.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 1st Appellant wrote to a letter

dated 10.09.2014 to the Hon. Attorney General seeking his sanction to

appeal against the acquittal of the Accused. The Hon. Attorney General

after examining the proceedings and the judgment of Learned

Magistrate of Kurunegala, informed the 1st Appellant by a letter dated

CA PHC 155/18

5 | P a g e

23.09.2014 that there were no sufficient grounds to prefer an Appeal

under Section 320(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure act No. 15 of

1979 against the judgment of Learned Magistrate of Kurunegala.

As a next step, the Appellants after laps of 04 months filed a revision

application before the Provincial High Court of Kurunegala. After the

notice, the parities had filed their objections and written submissions.

On 05.09.2018, the Learned High Court Judge delivered her judgment

and dismissed the revision application filed by the Appellants on the

grounds that the Appellants had not presented any exceptional

circumstances to invoke revisionary jurisdiction of the High court which

could shock the conscience of the Court.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the High Court, the Appellants

now filed this appeal before this Court.

It is well settled law that the revision is a discretionary remedy that can

be granted only upon exceptional circumstances.

In Wijesinghe v. Tharmaratnam (Sri kantha Law Report Vol-IV 47),

the court held that:

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available

unless the application discloses circumstances which shocks the

conscience of the Court.

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. v. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd.

1987 1 SLR 5 the Court held that:

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the

appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional

circumstances exist warranting its intervention.

CA PHC 155/18

In this case the prosecution had called 15 witnesses and marked

documents P1-P15 in support of their case. When the prosecution

closed their case, the Learned Magistrate of Kurunegala had called for

the defence. The Accused giving evidence from witness box, closed his

case. On 29.08.2014, the Learned Magistrate delivered her judgment

and acquitted the Accused from all the charges.

The one and only exceptional circumstances urged before this Court is

that the Learned Magistrate of Kurunegala had failed to take into

consideration of the documents marked P1-PW15 during the trial. As

these are vital documents, the Counsel for the Appellants strenuously

argued that the Learned Magistrate should have perused and

considered them before delivering her judgment.

On perusal of the judgment of the Learned Magistrate of Kurunegala,

she had very correctly analysed the evidence adduced by the

prosecution and documents marked in the trial. Further, she had very

correctly considered the defence version before she arrived at her

decision. After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the

Learned Magistrate had concluded that the prosecution had failed to

prove the charges against the Accused beyond reasonable doubt.

Therefore, the Accused was acquitted from the case.

The Judgment of the Learned Magistrate does not show any miscarriage

of justice or error in law. The grounds mentioned in the petition of

appeal do not warrant any exceptional circumstances which shock the

conscience of the Court. Hence, the judgment dated 05.09.2018 of the

Learned High Court of Kurunegala dismissing the revision application

too had not caused any miscarriage of justice and is according to law.

Therefore, this appeal is dismissed.
