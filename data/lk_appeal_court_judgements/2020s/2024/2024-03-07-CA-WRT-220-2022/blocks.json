Thereafter the 2nd Respondent had sent notices to the Petitioner and the other residents who reside on either side of the roadway seeking a wayleave for a 33Kv electricity line along the said roadway. The Petitioner had objected to the laying of a 33Kv electricity line along the boundary of the Petitioners residential property. Afterwards, the 2nd Respondent had requested the 3rd Respondent to hold an inquiry and had sought permission to install such an electricity line. Accordingly, an inquiry had been held by the Assistant Divisional Secretary of Kaduwela. After obtaining certain clarifications from the 2nd Respondent pursuant to said inquiry, the 3rd Respondent had permitted the 1st Respondent to lay the 33Kv electricity line using the bundle system along the existing electricity line by his letter dated 01.02.2019 marked P27. A copy of the said letter P27 has also been forwarded to the Petitioner. The Petitioner states that she was unable to foresee the impact of laying the electricity line due to the ambiguous wording of the said letter and due to her lack of knowledge on the technical aspects.",

In terms of the height of the wires, it had been at the level of the second floor of the house.

Further, Regulation No.40 specified that no overhead line shall so far as is reasonably practicable, come so close to any building, tree or structure as to cause danger. The said Regulations do not expressly make a difference between wire or cable lines. The said Part 11 of Schedule 2 of P40 specifies the required minimum distance to be maintained. The 2nd Respondent sought to way leave for 33,000 Volts electricity line. In the case of an electricity line in which the nominal voltage is between 11,000 Volts to 33,000 Volts a minimum of 3.00 meters of vertical distance (minimum height) and 2.00 meters of horizontal distance (minimum width) is to be maintained from the building as per Part 11 of Schedule 2 of P40. The vertical distance would not become an issue in the instant application as the impugned electrical line is not constructed over the Petitioner building.",

At this juncture, it is noteworthy to observe that the 3rd Respondents inquiry marked P23 on whether the electrical line could be constructed within due distance limitations according to the Sri Lanka Electricity Act was met with a positive response from the 2nd Respondent by letter marked P24. However, the 1st and the 2nd Respondents have failed to take into consideration and comply with the Regulations marked P40 while constructing the electrical line as per the authorization given by the 3rd Respondent in P27.",
