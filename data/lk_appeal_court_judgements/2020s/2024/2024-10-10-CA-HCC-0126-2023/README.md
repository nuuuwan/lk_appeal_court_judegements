Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence by

the learned High Court Judge of Matara.

The appellant was initially indicted before the High Court of Matara for

committing the offence of grave sexual abuse of a minor on or about 15-12-

2002, and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of section 365B

(2)(a) of the Penal Code.

However, after the commencement of the evidence of the said minor, namely

PW-01 mentioned in the indictment, the prosecuting State Counsel has

withdrawn the indictment filed on the basis of grave sexual abuse and has

substituted the charge with that of a rape, punishable in terms of section

364(2) of the Penal Code.

The appellant has pleaded not guilty to the said charge, and after trial, the

learned High Court Judge of Matara of the Judgment dated 16-01-2023 has

Page 3 of 14

found the appellant guilty as charged and of the sentencing order of the same

date has sentenced the appellant for a period of 15 years rigorous

imprisonment in addition to a fine of Rs. 25,000/-. He has been ordered to

serve a simple imprisonment period six months in default.

In addition to the above, it has been ordered that the victim, namely the PW-01

should be paid compensation in a sum of Rs. 250,000/- and in default of

paying the said sum, it shall be recovered as a fine and the appellant should

serve one year imprisonment in default.

Facts in Brief

The victim was a 30-year-old married woman with 3 children when she gave

evidence at the trial on 30-05-2018.

She has been living with her mothers younger sisters family since she was 3

or 4 years old, as her mother was having a mental disorder. She was born on

06-11-1987 and has studied up to grade eight in her school. The appellant was

her mothers younger sisters husband. In her evidence she has stated that she

had to face the incident relevant to this case when she was 15 years of age and

on 15-12-2002. By that time her mothers sister had 5 children out of the

marriage with the appellant and all have been living in the same house. On

that day, the victims mothers sister, the wife of the appellant, has gone

overseas for employment. According to the evidence of the victim, the appellant

has returned from the airport and he was drunk at that time. When he came

home, all the children were at sleep and the victim was also sleeping in a room.

While sleeping, she has been awoken by the presence of the appellant near her.

Thereafter, he has removed her clothes and had forcible sexual intercourse

with her. She has described the acts committed by him and had stated that,

she started bleeding as a result of the sexual intercourse because she was

having her menstruation at that time. She has stated further that, this was not

the first time an incident of this nature occurred, but previously also the

appellant committed the same act on her without the knowing of his wife.

Page 4 of 14

She has stated that, she did not inform the rape committed on her previously

to anyone, because she was fearful of the appellant and he threatened her not

to divulge it to his wife.

On the following day morning, the victim has gone and informed one of her

neighbours who was also a relative about what happened to her and on her

instructions had gone to the grama niladharis office to lodge a complaint. She

has stated that she could not complain to the grama niladhari because the

appellant came and took her away. After taking her back to the house, it was

alleged that the appellant took her to the hospital to look after one of his

younger children who was warded at the hospital at that time. Later, she has

made a statement to the police as to the incident faced by her.

The victim has been cross-examined at length on behalf of the appellant and it

has been suggested that because of a love affair, the victim had with a

neighboring boy and because the appellant opposed it, she is making a false

allegation against him, which she has denied. The way the victim has answered

the questions during cross-examination makes it clear why she has been a

reluctant witness because of the fact that she was now happily married with 3

children of her own.

The prosecution has called the grama niladhari mentioned by PW-01 to give

evidence in the case. The grama niladhari was retired at that time, but a

person who knew the victim as well as the appellant and their families very

well. On 16-12-2002 while engaged in his duties, PW-01 has come to his office

around 11-12 noon and has been seated in his office while crying. When

questioned, she has reluctantly informed him that, her Bappa, referring to the

appellant, harassed her, without specifying what was the harassment. He has

advised her to go and inform the police, and has seen the victim leaving his

office. In the evening of the same day, he has gone to the house of PW-01 to

inquire into the matter and had been informed that she went to the police with

Page 5 of 14

two of her relatives. The grama niladhari has given a statement to the police in

this regard later.

The relative mentioned by PW-01, as the person to whom she related this

incident in the morning, has also given evidence as PW-03 in this action.

According to her evidence, she has been living next door to the appellant and

had been a relative of the family. On 16-12-2002 around 9:00 a.m., PW-01 has

come and informed her that she was raped by the appellant during the

previous night. She has instructed her to go to the grama niladhari and

complaint. She has seen the victim going towards the grama niladharis office.

Later, she has observed the appellant assaulting the PW-01 while chasing her

around the house. She has witnessed this incident around 1:30-2:00 in the

afternoon after PW-01 has returned from the grama niladharis office. After the

assault, the PW-01 has again come to her house, and she has been the one

instrumental in taking her to the police station.

According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who has

examined the child after the incident, he has observed an old tear in her

hymen. Although the victim has had no fresh injuries to her vagina, the doctor

has observed contusions on her vaginal walls. The doctor has recorded the

history given by the witness as rape by a known person.

According to the police officer who conducted the investigations into the

incident, the victim has come to the police station on the 18-12-2002 along

with two females and grama niladhari of the area and had complained about

an incident of sexual abuse committed on her by the appellant. This has

resulted in conducting investigations in that regard and the arrest of the

appellant.

Once the prosecution case was closed and the learned High Court Judge called

for a defence from the appellant, he has decided to make a statement from the

dock. He has admitted that the PW-01 was living with his family from a very

young age and has stated that it was he who looked after her. He has admitted

Page 6 of 14

that his wife left for overseas employment on 15-12-2002 and that he came

home after dropping her off at the airport.

He has claimed that, after coming home he went to sleep and in the morning

asked the PW-01 to prepare tea. It was his position that, PW-01 left the house

to fetch some water and did not return. While looking for PW-01, he has found

her at a house of one of his wifes relative. He has been informed that PW-01

wants to go to the grama niladhari. He has claimed that in the afternoon police

came and arrested him. The appellant has denied any involvement in

committing the alleged offence to the victim.

The wife of the appellant has also given evidence on behalf of him, and has

admitted that it was she who looked after the PW-01 because her mother was

suffering from a mental disorder. She has admitted leaving the country for

employment on 15-12-2002 and has claimed that the PW-01 had a love affair

with a person called Zawahir and her husband opposed the affair. She has

claimed that after the incident, PW-01 was sent for treatment for a mental

disorder and has denied that the appellant committed rape on PW-01.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel formulated the

following two grounds of appeal for consideration;

1. The learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the vital

omissions and the relevant contradictions marked V-01, 02 and 03.

2. Totality of the evidence has not been taken into account and as a

result, the learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the

evidence on the basis of lack of consistency, probability and

spontaneity.

It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that the evidence of

PW-01, namely, the alleged victim, lacks consistency as to the alleged offence

committed on her by the appellant. It was his position that the learned High

Page 7 of 14

Court Judge was erred when it was decided that the marked contradiction does

not go to the root of the matter, and therefore does not create a doubt in the

evidence of the victim. It was also his position that, the learned High Court

Judge has failed to consider several omissions brought to the attention of the

Court in the corrects perspective.

It was contended further that the evidence of PW-01 and PW-08 who were the

police officer who conducted investigations, shows that there were several inter

se contradictions in the evidence of PW-01 as to the manner the complaint was

made to the police and in her police statement the victim has failed to mention

that the appellant was drunk at the time the offence was committed on her.

It was also submitted that the PW-01 also claimed forgetfulness as an excuse

for her inconsistent evidence, and that there was no basis to consider that in

the favor of the prosecution case. The learned Presidents Counsel referred to

the medical evidence to argue that, the victim has not mentioned to the doctor

as to who committed the rape on her since the doctor has recorded the history

as raped by a known person.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel that the evidence led by

the prosecution when taken as a whole creates a reasonable doubt as to the

truthfulness of the evidence, which should have been considered in favor of the

appellant. He submitted that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the dock statement made by the appellant and the evidence called on

his behalf in its correct perspective. He moved for the acquittal of the appellant

on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt against the appellant.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General making submission on behalf of

the complainant-respondent, brought to the attention the age of the victim

when this incident occurred and the clear evidence given by her as to the

incident of rape committed on her. It was his position that there were no

reasons to believe that the victim or the other witnesses called on behalf of the

Page 8 of 14

prosecution were lying or not telling the truth. He submitted that the evidence

of the PW-01 can be accepted as cogent and truthful and the prosecution has

proved the case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant.

Referring to the evidence of the JMO, it was the position of the learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General that the doctor has observed clear contusions in the

vaginal walls of the victim even after 5 days of the alleged incident, which

clearly collaborat the evidence regarding rape by the victim. It was also his

position that there was no reason whatsoever for the victim to falsely implicate

the appellant who was the person who looked after her from a very young age.

It was submitted that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the

alleged contradictions, omissions, and whether the evidence can be believed,

and also the defence taken by the appellant, in his determinations, which

needs no interference from this Court.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

As the two grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider

the said grounds of appeal together.

Although, the learned Presidents Counsel made submissions on the basis that

the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the marked contradictions

and the pointed-out omissions in the corrects perspective, I find no basis to

agree with such a contention.

It is amply clear from the Judgment that the learned High Court Judge has

methodically considered the mentioned contradictions marked V-01 to V-03

and also the alleged omissions in the evidence of PW-01.

As correctly considered by the learned High Court Judge, no one is expected to

have a photographic memory of a horrific incident faced by an under-age minor

girl, which happened some 16 years before the victim was required to give

evidence in Court in its exact details or in a video like description.

Page 9 of 14

It was held in the Court of Appeal Case of D. Tikiribanda Vs. The Attorney

General-decided on 06-10-2009 reported in Bar Association Law Reports

2010 (B.L.R.) 92 that;

Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon as

possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders should not be allowed to

capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural inherent weaknesses of

small children.

At this stage, I find it appropriate to refer to the Indian case of Bhoginbhai

Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat (AIR 1983-SC 753 at pp 756-758) very often

cited in our Courts. It was held:

1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video

tape is replayed on the mental screen.

2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The

witness could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an

element of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to

be attuned to absorb the details.

3) Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the

sequence of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short

time span. A witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when

interrogated later on.

4) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court

atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination made by counsel and

out of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of

events, or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The

sub-conscious mind of the witness sometime so operates on account of

the fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witnesses is

Page 10 of 14

giving truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him

perhaps it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on

the spur of the moment.

As I have considered before, it is clear that by the time the victim gave evidence

she was a 30-year-old and was happily married with three children. Her

evidence needs to be considered in that context as well. I do not find any

material contradiction in the alleged contradiction marked V-01. When

considering the evidence of PW-01 and the relevant grama niladhari, what is

relevant is the fact that the victim has gone to the office of the grama niladhari

at the first available opportunity to make a complaint. It is clear from the

evidence of the Grama Niladhari, that the victim has come to his office and had

informed that the appellant harassed her. However, before he could inquire

further into it, the girl has left the place. It also appears that the grama

niladhari has advised her to go to the police, which may be the reason why he

has not probed further into it.

As considered correctly by the learned High Court Judge, the alleged

contradiction marked V-02 is not a contradiction that can be considered

relevant. And also, the contradiction marked V-03 where she has stated to the

police that at the time the appellant committed rape on her she did not feel

pain and there was no blood. The evidence of PW-01 amply provides that, she

has found blood due to her menstruating period being active. The evidence of

the JMO provides that this was not the first time she has been subjected to

penile penetration, as the scars found in her vagina were old ones which are

suggestive of previous sexual intercourse as stated by the victim in her

evidence.

Similarly, as well considered by the learned High Court Judge, the mentioned

omissions are not material when the evidence is considered in its totality as to

the trustworthiness of the evidence of PW-01.

Page 11 of 14

I have no basis to agree that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the evidence in its totality rather than compartmentalizing the same

or has failed to consider the consistency, probability and spontaneity of her

evidence.

The learned High Court Judge, after having drawn his attention to the essential

ingredients that need to be proved in a criminal case has addressed his mind to

the above factors before evaluating the evidence of the victim, as well as other

witnesses.

The fact that the victim was living with the family of the appellant since she

was a very young girl is an admitted fact. Her mother who was the elder sister

of the wife of the appellant was suffering from a mental ailment was also an

admitted fact. The appellant has admitted that, his wife left for overseas

employment on 15-12-2002 and he returned home late in that night after

dropping her off at the airport.

It is the evidence of the victim has been that the appellant he was drunk and

committed rape on her on that night. She has also given evidence to the effect

that this was not the 1st time, but it happened previously as well, without her

aunt being aware of such acts committed by the appellant. She has stated that

she did not understand the gravity of what was happening to her until late. It

is clear from the evidence that the victim has informed her relatives who lived

next door about the incident faced by her on that night. The testimony of PW-

03 confirms that fact. It was she who has advised the victim to go and meet the

grama niladhari. The grama niladhari (PW-04) confirms that the victim came to

his office and remained there while crying, and also the fact when inquired

briefly, she complained about harassment of her by the appellant.

Although it was not clear as to the events that took place thereafter, it is clear

that the victim has left the grama niladhari office before the grama niladhari

could probe further into it, which may be the reason as to why he has taken

upon himself to go an inquire about it in the afternoon.

Page 12 of 14

According to the evidence of the police officer who conducted investigations into

the matter, it is clear that the victim has come to the police station along with

two females and the grama niladhari to complain about what happened to her.

When considering the evidence in its totality, there cannot be any doubt as to

the fact of the victim lodging a complaint to the police under difficult

circumstances faced by her at that time. I do not find any reason to believe that

the circumstances under which the victim made her complaint to the police, as

a reason to doubt the evidence of PW-01 and other relevant witnesses. The

admitted mental ailment suffered by PW-01 has resulted after the incidents of

rape faced by her, which has been clearly explained in her evidence. This is not

a reason to suspect the truthfulness of the evidence of PW-01.

The Indian Supreme Court, in the case of Ramakant Rai Vs. Madan Rai AIR

2004 SC at 84, observed;

A person has, no doubt, a profound right not to be convicted of an offence

which is not established by the evidential standard of proof beyond

reasonable doubt. Though this standard is a higher standard, there is,

however, no absolute standard. What degree of probability amounts to

proof is an exercise particular to each case. Doubts would be called

reasonable if they are free from a zest for abstract speculation. Law cannot

afford any favorite other than truth. To constitute reasonable doubt, it must

be free from an over emotional response. Doubts must be actual and

substantial doubts as to the guilt of the accused persons arising from the

evidence, or from the lack of it, as opposed to mere vague apprehensions.

A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary trivial or a merely possible doubt:

but a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense. It must grow out

of the evidence in the case. The concepts of probability, and the degree of

it, cannot obviously be expressed in terms of units to be mathematically

enumerated as to how many of such units constitute proof beyond

reasonable doubt. There is an unmistakable subjective element in the

Page 13 of 14

evaluation of the degrees of probability and the quantum of proof. Forensic

probability must, in the last analysis, rest on a robust common sense and

ultimately, on the trained intuitions of the Judge. While the protection given

by the criminal proceeds to the accused persons is not to be eroded, at the

same time, uninformed legitimization of trivialities would make a mockery

of administration of criminal justice.

After having considered the prosecution evidence and being satisfied that the

prosecution has established a strong prima facie case against the appellant, the

learned High Court Judge has proceeded to consider the defence put forward

by the appellant, which was the correct approach in considering evidence in a

criminal case. The learned High Court Judge has well considered the manner

under which such a defence should be considered and after having drawn his

attention to the relevant legal principles in that regard, has cogently considered

whether the defence case put forward has created a reasonable doubt against

the evidence of the prosecution or at least whether it has provided a reasonable

explanation in that regard.

The position taken up by the appellant had been that the victim is

orchestrating a false narrative because he opposed a love affair she had with a

neighbouring boy. I do not find that as a reason for a girl of 15 years of age who

was dependent on the appellant and is family, to make a serious false

accusation of this nature and consistently maintain that stand.

When one looks at the evidence as a whole, it is quite obvious that such a

position has not created any reasonable doubt about the evidence of PW-01

and other witnesses. PW-03 and PW-04 can have no reason to give false

evidence if such a thing did not happen as they narrate. The evidence of the

wife of the appellant who gave evidence on behalf of him cannot speak about

the incident of rape alleged to have happened after she left the country. Her

evidence does not provide a basis to hold that, a doubt has been created or a

Page 14 of 14

reasonable explanation has been provided against the overwhelming evidence

placed before the Court by the prosecution.

For the reasons as stated above, I find no basis in the grounds of appeal urged

before this Court on behalf of the appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The judgement and the

sentence dated 16-01-2023 affirmed.

However, having considered the fact that the appellant has been in

incarceration from his date of conviction and sentence, it is ordered that the

sentence shall deem to have commenced from his date of sentence, namely,

from16-01-2023.
