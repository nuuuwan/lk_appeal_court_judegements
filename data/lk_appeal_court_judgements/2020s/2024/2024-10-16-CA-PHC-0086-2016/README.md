Introduction

This Appeal arises from the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of

Ratnapura, who dismissed the revision application submitted by the Defendant-

Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant). The revision

application was filed against the order of the learned Magistrate of Balangoda,

delivered under Section 10(1) of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act

No. 7 of 1979, as amended (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The learned

Magistrate's order directed the eviction of the Appellant, along with any

dependents, from the land in question.

The learned High Court Judge dismissed the application filed by the Petitioner

on the ground that, in light of the judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in

The Superintendent, Stafford Estate and Two Others v. Solaimuthu Rasu1

(hereinafter referred to as the Solaimuthu Rasu case), the Provincial High Court

lacks revisionary jurisdiction over an order issued by the Magistrate's Court

under the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act.

Aggrieved by this decision, the Appellant has appealed to this Court.

CA/PHC/0086/2016

When this matter was taken up for argument on the 20th June 2024, both parties

agreed to resolve the case by filing written submissions instead of presenting oral

arguments. Consequently, the Court fixed dates for the parties to file their

respective submissions. However, on the 28th August 2024, both parties

requested the Court to deliver judgment based on the written submissions that

had already been filed.

In response, the Court fixed the matter for judgment.

Factual background

The Complainant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) is the designated competent authority of the Plantation Industries

Monitoring Division under the Ministry of Plantation Industries. The

Respondent issued a quit notice in accordance with Section 3 of the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act, requiring the Appellant to vacate the land he was

occupying. When the Appellant failed to comply, the Respondent filed an

application with the Magistrates Court of Balangoda under Section 5 of the Act.

The learned Magistrate, acting under Section 6 of the Act, issued notice to the

Appellant, giving him the opportunity to show cause for why he should not be

evicted. The Appellant did respond, but the learned Magistrate, being dissatisfied

with the reasons provided, issued an order for ejectment under Section 7 of the

Act.

Aggrieved by this decision, the Appellant has sought to have the order of the

learned Magistrate revised by the High Court of Ratnapura. As previously stated,

the learned High Court Judge dismissed the Appellants application.

This appeal arises from the said order of dismissal by the learned High Court

Judge.

Analysis

It is well-established law that the right to appeal must be expressly granted by

statute2 and in the absence of such statutory provision, no right of appeal exists

against an order made by a lower Court. In this case, the State Land (Recovery

of Possession) Act specifically excludes the right to appeal as provided in

Section 10(2) of the Act. Therefore, the available remedies for the Appellant are

either to challenge the quit notice through an application for a prerogative writ

or to seek to revise the order of the learned Magistrate through a revision

application.

In the Solaimuthu Rasu case, the Supreme Court specifically held that, pursuant

to Article 154P(4)(b) of the Constitution, the writ jurisdiction of the Provincial

High Court cannot be invoked in matters concerning state lands that are not

included in the Provincial Council List.

At page 44 the Supreme Court observed;

When one transposes this interpretation on the phrase "any matter set out in

the Provincial Council List" that is determinative on the ingredient necessary

to issue a writ in the Provincial High Court in relation to State Land, the vital

precondition which is found in Article 154P (4)(b) of the Constitution is sadly

lacking in the instant case. (Emphasis added)

At page 55 it was observed;

There is much significance in the use of the words "any matter set out in the

Provincial Council List." The fundamental principle of constitutional

construction is to give effect to the intent of the framers and of the people

adopting it. Therefore, it is the paramount duty of this Court to apply the words

6

CA/PHC/0086/2016

as used in the Constitution and construe them within its four corners. (Emphasis

added)

In the present case, the Appellant has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction

conferred upon the Provincial High Court by Article 154P (3) of the Constitution,

and not the writ jurisdiction provided under Article 154P (4). It is important to

note that these two Articles are distinct to one another.

For clarity, I will reproduce the two Articles, which read as follows:

154P. (1)-(2) ()

(3) Every such High Court shall-

(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal jurisdiction

of the High Court of Sri Lanka in respect of offences committed

within the Province;

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any

law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect

of convictions, sentences and orders entered or imposed by

Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province;

(c) exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as Parliament

may, by law, provide.

(4) Every such High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue, according to law

(a) orders in the nature of habeas corpus, in respect of persons

illegally detained within the Province; and

(b) order in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against any person

exercising, within the Province, any power under

(i) any law; or

(ii) any statutes made by the Provincial Council

established for that Province.

CA/PHC/0086/2016

(5)-(6) ()

Appellants Contention

The learned Counsel for the Appellant argued in the written submissions that the

Solaimuthu Rasu case was predicated on Article 154P(4)(b), while the present

case is based on Article 154P(3)(b) of the Constitution. He emphasized the

distinction between the two Articles and contended that the judgment of the

Supreme Court in the Solaimuthu Rasu case does not serve as a binding

precedent for this appeal.

Furthermore, he referred to the case of Divisional Secretary, Kalutara and

Others v. Kalupahana Mestrige3 Jayatissa and argued that the learned High

Court Judge's finding that the High Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the

Appellant's revision application is clearly erroneous. However, it is important to

note that in the aforementioned case, the Supreme Court did draw a distinction

between Article 154P (4) and Article 154P (3) in its judgment, but it refrained

from making any definitive findings regarding the jurisdictional implications of

this distinction. For clarity, I will reproduce the relevant paragraph of the

judgment, which reads as follows:

At the stage of the hearing of this appeal it was argued on behalf of the

Applicant, that the order made by the High Court was made without jurisdiction

and for that reason is bad in law. Relying on the decision of this court in the case

of, The Superintendent, Stafford Estate Vs. Solaimuthu Rasu in S.C Appeal

21/2013 - SC minutes 17th July 2013, it was contended on behalf of the Applicant

that the Supreme Court had held, that there is no basis to invoke the writ

jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court on the subject of State Lands, as the

subject does not fall within the Provincial Council list.

I do not wish to consider this issue in the present judgement for two reasons.

Firstly, in the case referred to, the Supreme Court dealt with the powers of the

3 SC Appeal 246,247,249 & 250/14, Supreme Court Minutes dated 4th August 2017.

8

CA/PHC/0086/2016

Provincial High Court under Article 154P (4) of the Constitution (writ

jurisdiction), whereas in the instant case the Provincial High Court derives

jurisdiction under Article 154(P)(3) (powers to act in revision). Secondly, this

was not an issue on which leave was granted by this Court.

Nonetheless, the Appellant contends that since the Appellants application to the

High Court was a revision application under Article 154P (3) and not a writ

application under Article 154P(4)(b), the Provincial High Court has the

jurisdiction to hear and determine this matter.

The learned Counsel referenced an extract from the judgment in Nirmal Paper

Converters (Pvt) Ltd v. Sri Lanka Port Authority4, which appears to be irrelevant

to the current issue at hand. Furthermore, I could not locate such a statement in

the judgment of the cited case5.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant also cited Section 1836 of the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act in his written submissions; however, it is important

to note that the Act contains only Sections up to 16.

Respondents case

The learned President's Counsel for the Respondent, addressing the current issue

in his written submissions, has asserted that Articles 154P(3)(b) and 138 of the

Constitution clearly indicate that the revisionary jurisdiction regarding an order

under Section 10 of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act is not held by

the Provincial High Court, but rather by the Court of Appeal.

Solaimuthu Rasu is the judgment in which the Supreme Court interpreted Article

154P (4) of the Constitution. Under Article 154P(4)(b), the High Court is

empowered to grant orders in the nature of Writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus, and quo warranto only against any person exercising

6 At paragraph 22 of the written submission filed by the Appellant.

CA/PHC/0086/2016

power within the province under:

(i) any law; or

(ii)any statute made by the provincial Council established for that Province,

in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List.

Consequently, the Supreme Court, having examined Article 154P(4)(b) along

with other relevant Constitutional provisions, held that the action of the

Competent Authority in issuing a quit notice for ejectment does not fall within

the scope of the matters specified in the Provincial Council List. As a result, the

Provincial High Court does not possess jurisdiction to exercise writ jurisdiction

concerning quit notices issued under the State Land (Recovery of Possession)

Act, as amended.

Notably, Article 154P (3) does not contain any restrictions, such as any matter

set out in the Provincial Council List in Article 154P (4).

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Respondent submitted that the position

established by the Supreme Court in the Solaimuthu Rasu case was reaffirmed

in the case of Walallawita Kankanamlage Mahinda v. Herath Mudiyanselage

Nandasena, Divisional Secretary7. In that latter case, Their Lordships of the

Supreme Court held: in view of the judgement of this Court in Supreme Court

appeal 21/2013 the High Court of Badulla has no jurisdiction to hear and

determine this matter.

These proceedings are misplaced in law. The application is dismissed.

The Supreme Court Appeal No. 21/2013 referred to in the judgment above is the

Solaimuthu Rasu case. The judgment of the High Court of Badulla, which was

appealed to the Court of Appeal and subsequently to the Supreme Court,

originated from High Court (Badulla) Case No. 56/2012. According to the

certified copy filed in the record, this was a revision application submitted to the

7 S.C. Spl/L.A. No.211/2013, Supreme Court Minutes dated 20th January 2014.

10

CA/PHC/0086/2016

High Court. Therefore, the applicable constitutional provision should have been

Article 154P (3), whereas the Supreme Court scrutinized Article 154P (4) in the

Solaimuthu Rasu case.

Nonetheless, as correctly submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Respondent, the Supreme Court, in its brief order, has held that the High Court

of Badulla lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine the matter based on the

judgment delivered in the Solaimuthu Rasu case. However, it is important to note

that neither the Supreme Court in the Solaimuthu Rasu case nor in Walallawita

Kankanamlage Mahinda v. Herath Mudiyanselage Nandasena, Divisional

Secretary considered Article 154P (3) of the Constitution.

There is no doubt that this Court, being inferior to the Supreme Court, is bound

by the decisions of the latter. However, the key question arises as to whether the

decision in Walallawita Kankanamlage Mahinda v. Herath Mudiyanselage

Nandasena, Divisional Secretary8, made without considering the relevant

Constitutional provisions, is binding on this Court in an appeal from an

application filed in the High Court under Article 154P(3) of the Constitution. In

my view, with all respect to Their Lordships, the answer is no.

Substantive argument of the Appellant

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant contended that,through the

enactment of the phrase convictions sentences and orders entered or imposed

in Article 154P(3)(b), the Legislature clearly demonstrated its intention to grant

the Provincial High Court only appellate and revisionary powers over the

criminal jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court or Primary Court within that

province. It was argued that the Legislature did not intend to grant general

revisionary powers over all orders, particularly those of a civil nature, but rather

limited them to orders of a punitive or criminal nature.

The learned President's Counsel argued that the term orders in Article

154P(3)(b) is preceded by the words convictions and sentences and followed

8 SC Spl/LA No.211/2013, Supreme Court Minutes dated 20th January 2014.

11

CA/PHC/0086/2016

by the words entered or imposed. Applying the ejusdem generis rule, where

general words follow specific ones, he submitted that the Legislature's intent was

to confine the meaning of orders to those associated with convictions and

sentences, which are of a criminal nature. He further argued that the

Legislature's deliberate use of the specific terms convictions and sentences

before the general term orders reflects this intent. Consequently, orders must

be interpreted ejusdem generis with convictions and sentences. Additionally,

he pointed out that only convictions are entered and sentences are

imposed, leading to the conclusion that the orders referred in Article

154P(3)(b) are inherently punitive in nature.

Consequently, it was argued that an order made under Section 10 of the State

Land (Recovery of Possession) Act does not fall within the same category

(genus) as convictions and sentences.

However, I note that there is a significant difference between the Sinhala version

and the English version of Article 154P (3) (b). The Sinhala text states as follows:

154. (1)-(2) ()

(3) () (...)

() 138 , ,

,

;

() (...)

.

(4)-(6) (...). (Emphasis added)

According to Article 23 of the Constitution, all laws and subordinate legislation

must be enacted, made, and published in Sinhala and Tamil, along with their

English translations. Therefore, the Sinhala version of Article 154P(3)(b) takes

precedence over the English translation. In the Sinhala text, the Provincial High

Court is granted revisionary jurisdiction over ,

12

CA/PHC/0086/2016

(convictions, sentences, and orders), meaning that no limitations

or qualifications can be added to the word orders as per the Sinhala text.

I am mindful that the interpretation of the Constitution does not fall within the

jurisdiction of this Court, as it is the prerogative of the Supreme Court. However,

in this instance, it is not a matter of interpretation but rather a case of adhering

to the official text of the Constitution.

Therefore, the argument put forward by the Respondent cannot be sustained.

This appeal arises from an order () issued by the Magistrate under Section

10 of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act, in response to an application

made under Section 5 of the Act.

The learned President's Counsel for the Appellant argued that the revisionary

jurisdiction concerning orders made under Section 10 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act is granted to the Court of Appeal under Article

138(1) of the Constitution.

Article 138(1) of the Constitution. reads as follows;

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of the

Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all

errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by the High Court, in the

exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance,

tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal,

revision and restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions,

matters and things of which such High Court, Court of First Instance tribunal

or other institution may have taken cognization. (Emphasis added)

In his written submissions, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant

argued that, according to Article 138(1) of the Constitution, the Court of Appeal

possesses revisionary jurisdiction over all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions,

matters, and things. While the Constitution restricts the jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court to "convictions, sentences, and orders entered or

imposed," the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is not so confined; it is broad

13

CA/PHC/0086/2016

and encompasses all causes, suits, actions, proceedings, matters, and things.

When Article 154P(3)(b) was enacted, it was specifically limited to convictions,

sentences, and orders entered or imposed, reflecting the intention to confine it to

criminal matters. Thus, the revisionary jurisdiction over any orders that do not

fall within the same category as convictions and sentences remains exclusively

with the Court of Appeal.

The jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under Article 138 of the Constitution

encompasses appellate jurisdiction for correcting all errors of fact or law made

by the High Court in its appellate or original jurisdiction, or by any court of first

instance, tribunal, or other institution. This includes sole and exclusive

cognizance, through appeal, revision, and restitutio in integrum, of all causes,

suits, actions, prosecutions, matters, and things that such High Court, court of

first instance, tribunal, or other institution may have taken cognizance. Before

the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, this jurisdiction was exclusively

exercised by the Court of Appeal.

The Thirteenth Amendment granted appellate and revisionary jurisdiction over

convictions, sentences, and orders entered or imposed by the Magistrate's Courts

and Primary Courts within the Province to the Provincial High Court.

Significantly, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction over orders made by

tribunals or other institutions was not granted to the Provincial High Courts.

Consequently, the authority for the High Court to hear and determine appeals

from orders of the Labour Tribunals and from orders made under Sections 5 and

9 of the Agrarian Services Act had to be specifically provided for under the High

Court of Provinces (Special Provincial) Act No. 19 of 1990, as amended. The

restitutio in integrum jurisdiction was retained by the Court of Appeal, which

continues to exercise this power exclusively. As a result, the High Courts

concurrently exercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction over the matters that

were pro tanto transferred to them.

I acknowledge that when jurisdiction was conferred to the High Courts, the

Legislature did not use the terms all causes suits actions, prosecution, matters

and things ( , , , , )

14

CA/PHC/0086/2016

found in Article 138. Instead, Article 154P(3)(b), which established the

jurisdiction of the High Courts, specifically limited it to appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction concerning conviction, sentences and orders entered or imposed

by Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the Province.

Under the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act, as amended, an application

for ejectment under Section 5 must be filed in the Magistrate's Court that has

local jurisdiction over the land in question. According to Article 154P(3)(b), the

High Court of the Province has appellate and revisionary jurisdiction concerning

convictions, sentences, and orders ( ,

) issued by the Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within the

province.

The orders issued by the Magistrates Court are not confined to convictions

and/or sentences or related matters. There are many other types of orders made

by Magistrates in the exercise of their judicial powers that are unrelated to

convictions or sentences. A few examples include:

Under Section 61, the Magistrate can order the attachment of property

belonging to a person proclaimed under Section 60 of the Criminal

Procedure Code.

Under Section 81, the Magistrate can order security for maintaining the

peace.

Orders can be made under Chapter IX for the removal or abatement of

nuisances.

These examples illustrate just a few of the many orders a Magistrate can issue

that are not associated with convictions and sentences.

There is no doubt about the Legislature's clear intention to grant expanded

jurisdiction to the High Court in each Province to make justice more accessible

to the public, thereby reducing litigation costs and delays. Therefore, it is

reasonable to conclude that the Legislature did not intend to grant the High Court

appellate and revisionary jurisdiction over convictions and sentences, which are

more serious in nature, while reserving the jurisdiction to address minor orders

15

CA/PHC/0086/2016

made by a Magistrate for the Court of Appeal, a court that is higher than the High

Court in the judicial hierarchy.

Another issue raised by the Respondent is that the Appellant failed to outline any

exceptional circumstances in the Petition to the High Court that would justify the

exercise of the High Court's revisionary jurisdiction. However, the learned High

Court Judge did not assess the merits of the application; instead, he rejected the

Appellant's application solely on the basis that the High Court lacked jurisdiction

over the order made by the learned Magistrate under the State Land (Recovery

of Possession) Act.

Therefore, this Court need not engage with the aforementioned matter.

Conclusion

In light of the above analysis, I am of the view that the order () of

ejectment issued by the learned Magistrate under Section 10 of the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act clearly falls within the scope of Article 154P(3)(b)

of the Constitution.

Therefore, I hold that the learned High Court Judge erred in dismissing the

Revision Application filed by the Appellant on the grounds that the High Court

lacks jurisdiction. I set aside the order of the High Court Judge of Ratnapura

dated 3rd August 2016 and direct the sitting judge of the High Court of Ratnapura

to hear and determine this application on its merits expeditiously. No costs.
