JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54 (A) (b) and 54 (A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Trafficking and the Possession of 04.40 grams of Heroin (Diacetylmorphine)

on 11th January 2013.

Following the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the

learned High Court Judge of Colombo imposed the death sentence for both

counts on 20/06/2019.

CA/HCC/172/19

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the hearing,

the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The prosecution version fails test of credibility and probability.

2. The learned High Court Judge wrongly refused the evidence of defence

witnesses.

3. The Appellant was denied a fair trial.

In this case, the raid was conducted based on specific information received.

The raid was headed by PW1 with six male police officers from the Police

Narcotics Bureau. Each of them including the Government Analyst has been

named as witnesses in the indictment. The prosecution had called PW1,

PW6, PW9, and PW11 and marked productions P1 to P14 in support of their

case. The Government Analysts qualifications were admitted under Section

420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had made a dock statement,

called five witnesses, and closed his case.

Background of the case albeit briefly is as follows.

On 11/01/2013 PW1 SI/Udara attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau of

Colombo had conducted a raid acting based on information received from

PW6 PC 70731 Weerasinghe. PW6 had received information from his

personal informer that the Appellant was coming in a green coloured three-

CA/HCC/172/19

wheeler with Heroin said to have purchased from a place in Maligawatta. As

per the information, the Appellant was to arrive at Awwalsaviya Watta in the

Grandpass Police Division. After meeting with the informer, PW1 and PW6

had arrested the Appellant close by who had come in a three-wheeler as

expected according to the information received. Upon searching him, a

cellophane bag with some substance was recovered from underneath his

underwear. Upon the substances in the parcel recovered from the Appellant

reacting for Heroin (diacetylmorphine), he was arrested at 14:00 hours and

subjected to further investigation. As the investigation revealed that his

house was situated in Awwalsaviya Road, Grandpass, the police party had

gone to the Appellants house. Firstly, PW6 had searched the Appellants

house and found a cardboard box containing 1305 sachet packets which

were identified as consisting of Hans drug. Thereafter, the police party had

returned to the Police Narcotics Bureau at 18:10 hours, sealed the

production and entered the same in the production register. The substances

weighed about 300 grams. The sealed Heroin parcel was handed over to the

production officer PW9 IP/Rajakaruna on the following day, as he was not

available at the Bureau. Until such time, the sealed production was in the

custody of PW1.

Thereafter, PW6 was called to give evidence to corroborate the evidence of

PW1 and it was followed by the evidence of the Government Analyst and

PW9.

Usually, the burden of proof lies with the person who brings a claim in a

dispute. It is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas

probandi incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: "The necessity of proof

always lies with the person who lays charges." Hence an accused person has

no burden to prove his case unless he pleads a general or a special exception

in the Penal Code.

CA/HCC/172/19

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus:

[1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required

in a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree

is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree

of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof

beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the

community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of

justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a

remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the

sentence, of course it is possible, but not in the least probable, the case

is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will

suffice.

CA/HCC/172/19

6 | P a g e

As the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant are interrelated, the said

grounds will be considered together in this case.

The prosecution will often rely on evidence in the form of witnesses in order

to strengthen their claims. Witnesses are used to testify to seeing a person

committing a crime or who are able to place the suspect at the time and or

location of the crime. Experts fall into a separate and special category of

witnesses as they rely mainly on their expertise in a given field in order to

shed light on obscure or ambiguous aspects of a case.

However, it must be kept in mind that although alleged witnesses may testify

as to what they allegedly witnessed, it is up to the Judge or the Jury to assess

the credibility of the witness and therefore to confirm whether they can be

relied on.

The role of probability is pivotal in persuading the judge on specific points,

as higher probabilities increase the likelihood of the judge being convinced.

Probability plays a crucial role in criminal investigations, aiding in the

evaluation of the relevance of different types of evidence. In order to accuse

someone "beyond reasonable doubt," it is essential to possess substantial

evidence. To achieve this, certain assumptions must be made to draw

conclusions. The likelihood of these assumptions being accurate is precisely

termed the principle of probability in legal contexts.

In this case, police officers had conducted the raid relying upon the

information received by PW6. According to the informant a person was

suspected to have purchased Heroin from Maligawatte and to be travelling

to Awwalsaviya Road in a green coloured three-wheeler.

It must be mentioned here that the utilization of informants in Sri Lankan

criminal cases are quite common. Law enforcement officers often use

informants to attempt to fabricate cases against someone they believe is

guilty of a crime. Hence, quite understandably, the Judiciary faces a dilemma

CA/HCC/172/19

7 | P a g e

and it becomes quite an arduous task when it comes to verifying the

reliability of an information.

Throughout the trial, the defence took up the position that PW1 and PW6

had arrested a person called Rizwan before the arrest of the Appellant. It was

further contested that the Appellant was arrested at his residence upon the

information provided by Rizwan and at the Awwalsaviya Road as claimed by

the prosecution. When this position was put to PW1 and PW6 by the defence,

the duo had vehemently denied that they arrested Rizwan before they

arrested the Appellant. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Although PW1 and PW6 denied the arrest of a person called Rizwan, the

Officer-in-Charge of the Police narcotics Bureau and the Registrar of the

Colombo Magistrates Court who were called as defence witnesses confirmed

the arrest of a person called Rizwan just before the Appellant was arrested.

Defence witness CI/Hiriyadenya, Officer-in-charge of the Police Narcotics

Bureau admitted that before the arrest of the Appellant PW1 had arrested a

person called Rizwan who was produced to the Magistrate Court of Colombo-

This is a clear misdirection which certainly affect the right to a fair trial

guaranteed under the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

It is the evidence of PW1 that the substances were recovered from the

underneath of the Appellants underwear. But this position was contradicted

by PW6 who was near the Appellant when PW1 recovered the parcel.

According to PW6 the contraband was recovered between the underwear and

the trouser zip of the Appellant. As PW1 and PW6 stood together and

recovered the Heroin from the Appellant, their evidence cannot contradict on

this crucial point. This had escaped the attention of the learned High Court

Judge when he delivered the judgment.

The contention of the defence is that the Appellant was not arrested as stated

by PW1 and PW6, but was arrested at his house after he was shown to the

police by a person called Rizwan. This had been properly suggested to PW1

and PW6 by the defence. Although this position was denied by PW1 and PW6,

the defence witnesses endorsed the contention that a person called Rizwan

was arrested before the arrest of the Appellant. The learned High Court

Judge had come to the conclusion that that PW1 and PW6 had admitted the

arrested of Rizwan prior to the Appellant. This is a clear misdirection which

certainly affect the outcome of the case.

Judges formulate their judgments based on the information presented to

them during court proceedings, including verbal arguments, written

submissions, and supporting documents provided by the parties through

their legal representatives. They meticulously examine the facts presented

and evaluate the evidence that has been entered into the court record.

Ultimately, their decisions are based on an objective analysis of the law and

the evidence presented, rather than subjective personal beliefs. Relying on

personal beliefs would introduce significant bias into the judicial process,

CA/HCC/172/19

11 | P a g e

undermining the fairness and impartiality that are fundamental principles

of the legal system.

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the

prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant drew the attention of this court to the

questioning directed at the defence witnesses by the learned High Court

Judge.

In Sisilinona v Balasuriya [2002] 1 SLR 404 the Court held that:

The court must not question the witness in the spirit of beating him down

or encourage him to give answers accepting the position put to the witness-

It appears that the intention of the trial judge had been not to ascertain the

truth of the matter but to obtain contradictions which he did. In the

circumstances the conclusions arrived at by the trial judge are untenable.

In The Queen v David Perera 66 NLR 553 the Court held that:

A judge is not entitled to put leading questions, the answers to which are

calculated to prejudice the accused. Further, he must not ask questions in

CA/HCC/172/19

12 | P a g e

such manner or in such great number as to encroach upon the functions of

a Counsel who appears in the case.

In Gamage v Attorney General and Others [2020] 1 SLR 44

Samayawardena, J. held that:

Judges are not above the law. They cannot do anything they think

right. Although section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code, sections

164-165 of the Civil Procedure Code, and section 165 of the Evidence

Ordinance seemingly give unfettered discretion to the trial judge to

question witnesses, this is not so. These provisions are intended to be

used by judges sparingly and cautiously, not as a rule but as an

exception with the ultimate objective of ascertaining the truth, not to fill

in the gaps of the case of either the prosecution or defence.

Article 13(3) of our Constitution enshrines the concept fair trial. The Article

states:

Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard, in

person or by an Attorney-at-Law, at a fair trial by a competent court.

To determine whether you are innocent or guilty, the concept of fair trial

plays a vital role. A fair trial is a universally recognised human right. Fair

trials help to establish the truth and are vital for everyone involved in a case.

It is a cornerstone of democracy, helping to ensure fair and just societies.

In this case the learned High Court Judge from the Court had directed

voluminous questions to the defence witnesses. Thereby treated the defence

witnesses indifferently. This is an act which certainly affect the concept of

fair trial afforded to the Appellant.

CA/HCC/172/19

13 | P a g e

In this case the raid was conducted on information received. Further, the

raid conducted and the recovery of productions have failed to pass the test

of probability in this case. If the learned Trial Judge had examined the

evidence presented from the correct perspective, he would have been inclined

to accept the testimony provided by the Appellant.

Guided by the above cited judicial decisions, I conclude that the 1st, 2nd, and

3rd grounds advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on the

prosecution case.

As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 20/06/2019 on the Appellant. Therefore, he

is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
