This is an application in revision by the accused-appellant-petitioner (hereinafter

referred to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the discretionary power of revision

granted to this Court by Article 138 of The Constitution.

The petitioner has been charged before the Magistrates Court of Galle for having

in his possession 9750 milliliters of unlawfully manufactured liquor, and thereby

committing an offence punishable in terms of the Excise Ordinance.

After trial, the learned Magistrate of Galle has found the petitioner guilty as

charged of her judgment dated 16-11-2020. Having considered the previous

conviction record of the petitioner, the learned Magistrate has sentenced him for

a period of 6 months simple imprisonment and has fined him Rs. 50,000/- with

a default sentence of 3 months simple imprisonment.

Page 4 of 11

Being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence, the petitioner has filed an

appeal before the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province Holden in Galle

in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution.

It is clear from the certified copy of the case record of the High Court of Galle

that the petitioner has not diligently maintained his appeal. Although he has

been given several dates to file his written submissions and get ready for the

case, it has not been done. When the matter was finally taken up for argument,

the petitioner has been absent from the Court, and there had been no legal

representation for him as well.

It appears from the case record that the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of the Southern Province Holden in Galle, despite the

appellant being absent and unrepresented, has considered the merits of the

matter in pronouncing the appeal judgment dated 28-04-2023, wherein, the

learned High Court Judge has decided to dismiss the appeal on the basis that it

has no merit.

It is against this judgment, the petitioner has now filed the instant revision

application. Although the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of Galle has

been pronounced on 28-04-2023, the revision application before this Court has

been filed on 11-07-2023.

When this matter was supported for notice and for a stay order, this Court,

having considered the facts and the circumstances, decided to issue notice on

the respondent-respondents mentioned, and also issued an order staying the

proceedings before the Magistrates Court of Galle Case No. 93084 until the final

determination of this matter.

Accordingly, the respondent-respondents were allowed to file objections and the

petitioner was also allowed to file counter-objections in this regard.

When this matter was taken up for argument, the learned State Counsel who

represented the Hon. Attorney General and the complainant-respondent-

Page 5 of 11

respondents raised several preliminary objections as to the maintainability of the

application. However, this Court decided to consider the said preliminary

objections together with the merits of the application before this Court.

The learned State Counsel submitted that this is a matter where the proper

remedy available for the petitioner was to file an application for Leave to Appeal

to the Supreme Court before the Provincial High Court itself, or to seek Special

Leave to Appeal from the appellate judgment of the High Court from Their

Lordships of the Supreme Court, which the petitioner has failed to do. It was his

contention that if the petitioner chooses to file an application for revision against

judgment of the Provincial High Court pronounced, exercising its appellate

jurisdiction granted in terms of Article 154P of The Constitution, it is the duty of

the petitioner to plead before this Court the reasons as to why he did not exercise

his statutorily guaranteed remedy. The learned State Counsel submitted that

since it has not been explained, the revision application should be dismissed on

that ground itself.

He also submitted that the petitioner has even failed to provide exceptional

grounds under which he can seek remedy of revision, and what he has stated as

exceptional grounds in his petition, cannot be treated as so. It was his view that

the said grounds should have been pleaded in a properly submitted Leave to

Appeal application before the correct forum.

It was also pointed out that the petitioner has failed to explain his delay in filing

this revision application, which is a matter that disentitles him from seeking the

remedy of revision. It was also submitted by the learned State Counsel that the

learned Magistrate of Galle, as well as the learned High Court Judge of the

Provincial High Court of the Southern Province Holden in Galle, has decided the

matter on its merit, and hence, there is no basis to consider this application

based on exceptional circumstances.

Page 6 of 11

Answering the preliminary objections, the learned Counsel for the petitioner took

up the position that the Hon. Attorney General has failed to file his objections

following the Appellate Court Procedure Rules.

He relied on the case of Gita Fonseka Vs. The Monetary Board of The Central

Bank of Sri Lanka (2004) 1 SLR 149 to argue that the preliminary objections

should fail, as it has not been supported by an affidavit. He insisted that the

petitioner has submitted sufficient exceptional grounds in his petition, which

needs the intervention of this Court.

The learned Counsel explained the delay in filing this application stating that the

COVID pandemic contributed to the delay. He also submitted several grounds

challenging the conviction of the petitioner by the learned Magistrate and also

the appellate judgment by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High

Court of the Southern Province Holden in Galle, stressing that this is a fit and

proper case for this Court to intervene and set aside the relevant judgments as

justice demands. He also submitted that there was no fair trial towards the

petitioner.

Before moving on any further, I would like to comment on the argument mooted

by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the respondents have failed to

follow Appellate Court Procedure Rules when filing objections since the

objections have not been accompanied by an affidavit.

I am of the view that the cited case of Gita Fonseka Vs. The Monitory Board of

The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (supra) has no relevance to the above

submission.

The cited case was a matter where the respondent has filed only an affidavit

instead of a proper statement of objections in relation to an application before

the Court of Appeal. It has been held that such procedure amounts to not

following Rule 3(4)(b)(i) of the COURT OF APPEAL (APPELLATE RULES) 1990 and

Rule 3(7), where it is necessary for a respondent to file a statement of objections,

Page 7 of 11

and if such statement of objection contain any averment of facts, such facts shall

be supported by an affidavit in support of such averments.

In the instant matter, the respondents have duly filed their statement of

objections and since it does not mention any averments of facts, it is the view of

this Court that no affidavit would be necessary. As submitted correctly by the

learned State Counsel, if the appellate judgment of the learned High Court Judge

of the Provincial High Court of the Southern Province Holden in Galle was

pronounced without hearing the petitioner for no fault of him, the proper

procedure would have been to go before the same Court seeking a relisting of the

appeal. I find that the petitioner has failed to follow that course of action before

filing this revision application.

Besides that, for a person aggrieved of an appellate judgment pronounced by a

High Court of the Province exercising its appellate jurisdiction granted in terms

of Article 154P of The Constitution, the statutory remedy available has been

prescribed in section 9 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act

No.19 of 1990, which reads thus;

9. Subject to the provisions of this act or any other law, any person

aggrieved by

(a) A final order, a judgment, decree or a sentence of a High

Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the

exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph

(3)(b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or section 3 of this act

or any other law, in any matter or proceeding whether civil or

criminal which involves a substantial question of law may

appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court if the High Court grants

leave to appeal to the Supreme Court ex maro moto or at the

instance of any aggrieved party to such matter or proceedings:

Provided that the Supreme Court may in its discretion, grant

special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court from any final or

Page 8 of 11

interlocutory order, judgment, decree or sentence made by such

High Court in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested

on it by paragraph (3)(b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or

section 3 of this act or any other law where such High Court has

refused to grant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court or where

in the opinion of the Supreme Court, the case or matter is fit

for review by the Supreme Court :

Provided further that the Supreme Court shall grant leave to

appeal in every matter or proceeding in which it is satisfied that

the question to be decided is of public or general importance

It is an admitted fact that the petitioner has not availed the above-mentioned

statutory right, but has come before this Court seeking to exercise the

exceptional discretionary remedy of revision that can be exercised by this Court.

It is well settled law that even in a situation where a specific appellate right has

been provided, yet a person can file an application for revision before the Court

of Appeal.

In the case of The Attorney General Vs. Podisingho 51 NLR 385, it was held

that,

That the powers of revision of the Supreme Court are wide enough to

embrace a case where an appeal lay but not taken. In such a case, however,

an application in revision should not be entertained save in exceptional

circumstances, such as,

(a) Where there has been a miscarriage of justice,

(b) Where a strong case for the interference of the Supreme Court has been

made out by the petitioner, or

(c) Where the applicant was unaware of the order made by the Court of

trial.

Page 9 of 11

It is also my considered view that in such situations, the person who files the

revision application must plead as to the reasons why he did not or could not

avail himself of such statutorily available remedy.

As pointed out correctly by the learned State Counsel, the petitioner has failed

to provide any reasons in that regard in his petition filed before this Court.

It is also settled law that any person who comes before this Court seeking the

discretionary remedy of revision must establish sufficient exceptional grounds,

which needs this Courts intervention.

In the case of Caderamanpulle Vs. Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd. (2001) 3 SLR 112,

it was held that,

The existence of exceptional circumstances is a pre-condition for the

exercise of the powers of revision.

Per Nanayakkara, J.

when the decided cases cited before us are carefully

examined it become evidence in almost all the cases cited that

the powers of revision had been exercised only in a limited

category of situations. The existence of exceptional

circumstances is a pre-condition for the exercise of the powers

of revision and absence of exception circumstances in any given

situation results in refusal of remedies.

What is termed as exceptional grounds in paragraph 16 of the petition are

grounds that can be generally stated when filing an appeal challenging a

judgment pronounced by a competent Court, and cannot be considered as

exceptional grounds that requires the intervention of this Court exercising the

Courts revisionary jurisdiction.

As required by law, the discretionary remedy should be sought as soon as

possible by the aggrieved party. The petitioner has filed this application before

Page 10 of 11

this Court on 13-07-2023, seeking to challenge an appellate judgment

pronounced by the Provincial High Court on 28-04-2023. The petitioner has

failed to explain such a delay in filing the petition before this Court. I am of the

view that stating that the COVID pandemic prevented him from filing this

application when this matter was raised before this Court would not be a

sufficient explanation for such a delay, as the said pandemic was not prevalent

at that time to a level which prevented a person from asserting his rights.

Although the question of delay is a subjective thing, which may vary depending

on the facts and the circumstances unique to each case, I do not find that

sufficient explanation has been provided in the instant matter for the delay.

In the case of Biso Menike Vs. C.R. de Alwis (1982) 1 SLR 368, which was a

case decided relating to an application for a Writ of Certiorari, a similar

discretionary remedy, it was observed by Sharvananda, J. (as he was then),

A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be held

to be a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. The exercise of this

discretion by Court is governed by certain well-accepted principles. The

Court is bound to issue it at the instance of a party aggrieved by the order

of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has disentitled himself to

the discretionary relief by reason of his own conduct, submitting to

jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or waiver.. The proposition that the

application for Writ must be sought as soon as injury is caused is merely an

application of the equitable doctrine that delay defeats equity and the longer

the injured person sleeps over his rights without any reasonable excuse the

chance of his success in Writ application dwindles and the Court may reject

a Writ Application on the ground of unexplained delay.An Application for

a Writ of Certiorari should be filed within a reasonable time.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the learned State

Counsel has raised valid preliminary objections before this Court.

Page 11 of 11

Apart from the above, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has

acted correctly when the learned High Court Judge considered the merits of the

appeal preferred before the Court, despite the appellant being absent from the

Court.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has considered the facts before the

Court in its correct perspective, which needs no interference from this Court.

Accordingly, the revision application is dismissed based on the preliminary

objections, and this Court finds no merit in relation to the facts stated therein.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

Provincial High Court of the Southern Province Holden in Galle for information,

and to the Magistrates Court of Galle for necessary procedural steps.
