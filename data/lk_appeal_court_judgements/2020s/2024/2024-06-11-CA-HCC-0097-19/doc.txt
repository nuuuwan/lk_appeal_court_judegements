WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for

trafficking and possessing 2.64 grams of Heroin, on or about

24.07.2014, offences punishable under Section 54A(b) and 54A(d) of

the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by

Act No.13 of 1984. After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo

convicted the accused-appellant of both counts by his judgment dated

15.05.2019 and imposed life imprisonment for both counts. This appeal

has been preferred against the said convictions and the sentences.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of both

parties. The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant and the

learned Senior State Counsel (SSC) for the respondent made oral

submissions at the hearing of the appeal.

In brief, the prosecution story is as follows:

On July 24, 2014, about 14:40, IP Mahinda Wanasinghe, PW-1,

received information from an informant that a bearded man named

Kasun, who lives in the Henamulla camp and is dressed in a black

collarless t-shirt and red shorts, is making preparations to bring heroin

to a place near the mosque situated close to the playground called

Somaliyawa. PW-1 was asked to come over and be located nearby, and

he was further informed that he would make a follow-up call when the

aforementioned Kasun" leaves his residence.

At 14:45 p.m., PW-1 organized a group of twelve police officers,

including IP Wasantha Kumara and, PW-2, for a raid, and they departed

the police station for the detection by a van belonging to the police

department. The investigation team arrived at 15.05 p.m. and parked

the van at a land belonging to the Municipal Council which was situated

near to the Playground called Somaliyawa. While they were waiting in

the Van around 15:10 p.m., the informant called again, urging them to

approach the mosque right away. Accordingly, the police team drove up

to the mosque, parked the van there, and ten police officers continued

walking along the street where the van had been parked. Thereafter,

they turned onto a by-way on the left and saw a person who fit the

informant's description approaching them from a distance of roughly

ten to fifteen meters. However, according to the prosecution evidence,

the person has turned back presumably after seeing PW-1 who was

wearing the police uniform at the time. Thereafter, the police team ran

behind him and caught him. Upon search, the police found a light pink

colour cellophane bag in his right-side trouser pocket containing a light

brown powder which was identified as heroine and accordingly he was

arrested at 15.15 p.m. The heroin found in the possession of the

accused-appellant was put to the envelope that police took along with

sealing equipment. The heroine package was then weighed and sealed

at the Dedigama Pawning Centre on Baseline Road, where the police

Page 4 of 11

team next went. They then went on to the Colombo Crimes Division,

where the investigating team was based, and arrived there at 15.25 p.m.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant did not formulate

specific grounds of appeal. He contended that PW-1 stated once that he

arrested the suspect at 3.15 p.m. (page 72 of the appeal brief) and in

his evidence in chief, PW-1 stated the van that they travelled reached

the Colombo Municipal Council at 3.15 p.m. (page 40 of the appeal

brief) and he received the telephone call from the informant at 3.10 p.m.

The learned Presidents Counsel pointed out if the van reached the

Colombo Municipal Council at 3.15 p.m. the accused-appellant cannot

be arrested at the same time, thus, the prosecution story is improbable.

Pointing out the items of evidence appear at page 66 of the appeal brief,

the learned SSC submitted that the aforesaid times mentioned by the

learned Presidents Counsel are typing mistakes. However, it is to be

noted that the learned State Counsel appeared in the High Court had

not taken steps to rectify them if they were typing mistakes.

Another point that the learned Presidents Counsel stressed was that

the information received was that a bearded person named Kasun is

getting ready to bring heroin to a place near a mosque situated close to

playground called Somaliyawa. Also, he has informed PW-1 that when

the Kasun leaves his home he will give another telephone call. The

learned Presidents Counsel contended that when the police received an

information that a person is coming from home with heroin, it is natural

to search the home after that person is arrested. However, in this case,

the learned Presidents Counsel contended that no police officer had

searched the house of the accused-appellant and this reason also

makes the prosecution story improbable.

The learned Presidents Counsel also contended that according to

PW-1, the detection took place on a by road after he noticed the

accused-appellant walking towards them, whereas according to PW-2

Page 5 of 11

the detection took place not on a by road and PW-2 did not see from

where the accused came to the scene of the detection on the main road

leading to the Heinamulla camp.

The learned Presidents Counsel pointed out further that according to

PW-1 hand cuffs were taken (page 39 of the appeal brief) when they

went for the raid but according to PW-2 hand cuffs were not taken (page

106 of the appeal brief).

The learned Presidents Counsel also submitted that PW-2 made his

notes after he came to the police station, but even at the police station,

he has not made his notes on the information book maintain at the

police station but on a crime pad and thereafter the notes that he made

on the crime pad has been pasted three days later. The learned

Presidents Counsel contended that this is also an unusual way of

making notes. It is correct that if PW-2 came to the police station and

made notes, he could have used the information book maintained at

the police station to make notes without making notes on the crime pad

and taking three days to paste the notes.

Other than the aforesaid discrepancies and improbabilities of the

prosecution case, the learned Presidents Counsel has also pointed out

some other defects in the prosecution case and contended that the

charges have not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant stressed another fact that the

main investigating officer PW-1 was clad in uniform and he went with

twelve other officers who were not in uniform. What the learned

Presidents Counsel pointed out was that in a raid of this nature, one

police officer goes with the uniform but normally the main investigating

officer does not go with the uniform. The learned SSC stated in reply

that the main investigating officer clad in uniform is not unusual.

The important matter that this Court observed is that although the

learned High Court Judge stated that prosecution has proved the

Page 6 of 11

charges beyond a reasonable doubt, the learned Judge has not given

reasons for the said decision. His Judgment contains seventeen pages.

Up to the page 15 of the Judgment, there is only narration of evidence

of the prosecution and defence. Thereafter, the learned Judge states

that there are no discrepancies in the prosecution evidence and the

prosecution has proved the first and second counts beyond a

reasonable doubt. Accused-appellants dock statement has been

rejected for the reason for not complaining to a higher police officer

about his illegally arrested.

When the learned High Court Judge came to the conclusion that there

are no discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, he

has not considered any of the contradictions pointed out by the learned

Presidents Counsel for the appellant. When PW-2 stated that they did

not take hand cuffs when they went for the raid, and PW-1 stated that

they took hand cuffs when they went for the raid, the learned High

Court Judge decided stating no reason that it is proved that they had

taken hand cuffs (page 8 of the High Court Judgment) when they went

for the raid. Not only the aforesaid contradiction, but also the other

discrepancies, infirmities and improbabilities pointed out by the

learned Presidents Counsel have not been considered by the learned

Judge. It appears clearly that this is a Judgment written without

analyzing the prosecution evidence. In other words, the learned High

Court Judge has concluded that two charges have been proved beyond

a reasonable doubt without analyzing the prosecution evidence.

Apart from that, the learned High Court Judge rejected the dock

statement of the accused-appellant for the reason that the accused-

appellant had not complained to the higher police officer if he had been

arrested without any reason. No other reason is mentioned in the

Judgment to reject the dock statement. The learned Judges reason for

rejecting the dock statement appears as follows:

Page 7 of 11

.

It must be said that this is by no means a reason to reject the dock

statement. The meaning of the said statement of the learned Judge is

that when an accused makes a statement from the dock stating his

innocence, the said statement cannot be considered if he had not made

a complain about that to a higher police officer. When a person is

produced before a Magistrate as a suspect for an offence under Section

54A of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance,

Magistrate has no jurisdiction to grant bail. Hence, after the arrest, the

suspect has to be in remand. Therefore, practically, the suspect has no

opportunity to make a complaint to a higher police officer. Even if there

was an opportunity, any accused person can come to the Court and

claim his innocence and there is no requirement to complain to the

police before coming to the Court to consider his statement or evidence

by the learned Trial Judge.

The presumption of innocence is a fundamental principle that lies at

the core of the Criminal Justice System in Sri Lanka as well as in many

other jurisdictions worldwide. Under this principle, every accused of a

crime is deemed innocent until proven guilty by a competent Court of

Law. When a Trial Judge is called for a defence, every accused is free to

state his innocence before the Court by way of a dock statement or by

giving evidence. In the instant action also, when the appellant stated in

making a dock statement that he was arrested without any reason, the

learned Trial Judge should have considered his statement and see

whether the said statement creates a reasonable doubt on the

Page 8 of 11

prosecution case. Certainly, the learned Trial Judge can reject the said

statement, if he is not satisfied but he must first consider the dock

statement of the accused and if the learned Judge thinks that the dock

statement cannot be accepted, he can reject it stating the reasons for

the rejection. In the case at hand, as stated previously, the learned High

Court Judge rejected the dock statement for the reasons stated above

without considering the same. Therefore, the learned Judge has not

only did not analyze the prosecution evidence but also did not consider

the dock statement in deciding that the charges have been proved

beyond a reasonable doubt.

In addition, when convicting the accused-appellant for the first charge

of trafficking 2.64 grams of heroin, the learned High Court Judge

convicted him for the said offence stating in the Judgment that 2.64

grams of heroin is not kept for his personal consumption and thus, it

should have been kept on the intention of trafficking. I must say that

the said basis of the learned Trial Judge to convict the appellant for the

offence of trafficking is completely wrong. In the Section 54A of the

Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drug Ordinance as amended by the Act

No. 13 of 1984, the meaning of traffick is given as follows:

(a) To sell, give, procure, store, administer, transport, send,

deliver or distribute; or

(b) To offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a).

If it is found that the accused is engaged in one of the things specified

in the aforesaid interpretation of traffick, he could be convicted for

trafficking. In the case at hand, if it was found after correct analysis of

the evidence that the appellant was in possession of heroin, he could

have been convicted for trafficking, as he had transported the heroin

according to the prosecution story. However, it is completely wrong to

convict an accused for trafficking when the Trial Judge felt that the

quantity of heroin is excess than what is kept for personal

consumption.

Page 9 of 11

Section 283(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states that The

judgment shall be written by the Judge who heard the case and shall

be dated and signed by him in open court at the time of pronouncing it,

and in case where appeal lies shall contain the point or points for

determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for the decision

(emphasis added). The impugned Judgment does not contain the points

for determination and the reasons for the decision. Hence, the

Judgment is not in compliance with Section 283(1) of the CCPA and

cannot be allowed to stand.

The next matter to be considered is, as requested by the learned SSC

whether this case can be sent back for retrial. In this case, the offence

was committed on 24th of July 2014 according to the indictment. The

accused-appellant was convicted on 15.05.2019. The appeal was heard

in 2024. Now, ten years have elapsed since the date of the offence. The

appellant has been incarcerated for almost five years. In the case of

Nandana V. Attorney General (2008) 1 Sri L.R. 51, it was held that

therefore, a discretion is vested in the Court whether or not to order a

retrial in a fit case, which discretion should be exercised judicially to

satisfy the ends of justice, taking into consideration the nature of the

evidence available, the time duration since the date of the offence, the

period of incarceration the accused person had already suffered, and

last but not least, the trauma and hazards an accused person would

have to suffer in being subject to a second trial for no fault on his part

and the resultant traumatic effort in his immediate family members

who have no connection to the alleged crime.

In the case at hand also, there was no fault of the accused-appellant.

In fact, there was no fault of the prosecution as well. The prosecution

presented their case and the accused-appellant presented his case.

However, the learned Trial Judge has come to a conclusion without

analyzing the prosecution evidence and not considering the dock

statement. There is a maxim Actus Curiae Neminem Gravabit. The

Page 10 of 11

meaning of this maxim is that an act of the Court shall prejudice no

man. Hence, the accused-appellant of this case should not suffer again

by facing a fresh trial after ten years.

In the said Judgment of Nandana V. Attorney General it is also stated

as follows: as regards the second ground as to the time duration, it

must be noted as the alleged offence has been committed on 07.02.99,

almost ten years have elapsed since the date of the offence. In a long

line of case law authorities, our Courts have consistently refused to

exercise the discretion to order a retrial where the time duration is

substantial.

In Peter Singho V. Werapotiya 55 NLR 157, Gration, J. refused to

order a retrial where the time duration was over 04 years.

In Queen V. Jayasinghe - 69 NLR 413, Sansoni, J. refused to

order a retrial where the time duration was over 03 years.

In L.C. Fernando V. Republic of Sri Lanka 79 (2) NLR 313 at

374 Wijesundara, J. held that it is a basic principle of the

criminal law of our land, that a retrial is to be ordered only, if it

appears to the Court that the interest of justice so required.

In the case at hand, as ten years have elapsed since the date of the

offence, in view of the aforesaid decisions, I hold that this is not a fit

and proper case to order a retrial.

For the reasons stated above, the appeal is allowed and the convictions

and sentences dated 15.05.2019 are set aside. The accused-appellant

is acquitted of both counts.
