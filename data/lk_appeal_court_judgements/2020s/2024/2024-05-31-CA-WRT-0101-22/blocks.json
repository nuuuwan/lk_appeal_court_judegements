It is important to note that the State was not a party to above mentioned partition action. The decree in a partition action is considered as a decree in rem and accordingly, the 1st Respondent is also bound by the decree in the above partition decree even though the State was not a party to such partition action. However, neither such interlocutory decree nor the final decree has been set aside or interfered with, by way of an appeal or revision. Hence, it is contended that the 1st Respondent has no power or authority to make a finding contrary to that of the said partition decree in issuing the relevant quit notices under the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act. The Petitioners further submit that, in any event, a fair hearing should be given to all relevant parties in order to decide whether the land in issue is State land or not for the purpose of issuance of a quit notice, however, the 1st Respondent has failed to do so.

This Court must state that in doing so, it is not the function of this Court to consider the title of the State, or for that matter, the title of the person sought to be ejected, to the said land.

This Court wishes to state however that merely because a person who is to be ejected or against whom an order for ejectment has been made, has a remedy by way of Section 12, does not absolve the Competent Authority from his obligation to act reasonably and legally when forming the all important opinion in terms of Section 3.",

As the Respondents submit, a note which appears in the Advance Tracing Plan X2 specifies that the land depicted in the X2 is part of the reclaimed Negombo Lagoon as depicted in the aforesaid Plans R1, R2 and R3. Accordingly, the documents prepared by the Superintendent of Surveyor (Gampaha) identify the impugned lots referred to in the quit notices marked X-1a, X-1b, and X-1c as part of a reclaimed portion of the Negombo Lagoon. As per Section 21 of the Survey Act No.17 of 2002, a cadastral map or plan prepared by the Surveyor General shall be taken to be prima facia evidence. The said Section 21 reads;",
