Introduction

The Petitioner is the father of minor child Udayasooriyan Oneliya Steffani1 who

sought admission to Grade 1 of Girls High School, Kandy (hereinafter referred to

as the GHS, Kandy).

The 1st Respondent is the Principal of GHS, Kandy and the 2nd Respondent is the

president of the Interview Appeal Board for Grade 1 admissions to the school for

the year 2020. The 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents are respectively Secretary to the

Ministry of Education, Director in charge of National Schools and the Hon.

Miniter of Education. The 6th Respondent is the Hon. Attorney General and

according to the Petitioner, was named in compliance with the constitution and the

rules of this Court. However, the 1st, 3A and 5A Respondents stated that there is no

constitutional or procedural requirement to name the Hon. Attorney General in

proceedings of this nature.

The Petitioner, being the father of the aforesaid child, instituted these proceedings

seeking inter-alia, a writ of mandamus directing the 1st and 3rd Respondents to

1 Birth certificate P 1.

5 CA/WRT/0294/2020

enrol the Petitioners daughter Udayasooriyan Oneliya Steffani to the school under

the category of close proximity and based on Christianity.

The 1st, 3A and 5th Respondents filed their objections seeking to dismiss the

Petition.

In reply, the Petitioner filed a counter affidavit.

Factual background

The Petitioner submitted an application2 to the GHS, Kandy seeking to enrol his

child Udayasooriyan Oneliya Steffani to Grade 1 of the school. The Petitioner

states that he submitted all necessary documents to substantiate his claim to be

qualified under the close proximity category and Christianity basis, in terms of

circular No.29/2019 (1 R 1/P 3(a)) issued by the Ministry of Education.

It was revealed during the argument that the copy of the circular annexed to the

Petition marked P 3 A was incomplete, and the parties subsequently agreed to

follow the circular submitted by the Respondents marked 1 R 1. However, the

Circular provided with the objections was missing some pages. Therefore, the

Respondents later submitted the full text of the circular along with a motion.

In response to the Petitioners claim that he submitted all necessary documents, the

Respondents argued that the documents did not substantiate the 'proximity'

required to secure the necessary marks for that category. Addressing the 1st, 3A,

and 5A Respondents' contention, the Petitioner stated in his counter affidavit that

he explicitly mentioned in the first section of his application 'P 3' that he was

seeking enrolment for his child on the 'Christianity basis,' under the 'close

proximity category.' Specifically, the Petitioner wrote in his application3,

' ( )' as the

category.

2 P 3, 1st cage. 3 P 3.

6 CA/WRT/0294/2020

The Respondents correctly pointed out that Circular No. 29/2019 does not include

a category under Clause 3 as described by the Petitioner. The only applicable

category under Clause 3 for the Petitioners application is the proximity category4.

The Petitioner clarified that his application to enrol his child in the nearest school

where the Christian religion is taught. The religious basis is not a distinct category

under Circular No. 29/2019; rather, it is a consideration within the categories listed

in Clause 3.

It is important to note that while the Circular acknowledges religious basis, there is

no specific section in the application for stating this basis, though there are

sections for stating the religion of the parents. Therefore, the Petitioner cannot be

faulted for including this basis in section 1, where the application category is

indicated. Be that as it may, GHS, Kandy considered the Petitioners application

under the proximity category and maintained that the child could not be admitted

due to a limit of six allocated seats.

The Petitioner attended the interview for admission to GHS, Kandy, and his child

received only 32 out of 100 marks5. Subsequently, the Petitioner appealed to the 1st

Respondent, the Principal of GHS, Kandy. After a hearing, it was decided that no

change in the marks was necessary, and consequently, the child did not qualify for

admission.

The Petitioner alleges that he was not informed of the decision to reject his appeal.

However, the Respondents contended that the decision was communicated to the

Petitioner, as indicated by letter 'P 8'. 'P 8' is a letter sent in response to an

application made by the Petitioner under the Right to Information Act. It states that

the rejection letter was sent on 27th December 2019, via registered mail, but a copy

could not be issued as one was not retained. According to Clause 2.6 of Circular

No. 29/2019, applicants who were not selected must be informed by a letter

bearing the signature and seal of the principal. This letter should follow the format

4 Clause 3.1. 5 P 6.

7 CA/WRT/0294/2020

specified in Schedule V of the circular and should include both the cut-off marks

for the category under which the application was made and the marks obtained by

the candidate.

Under Clause 18.3, comprehensive records of such letters must be maintained at

the school. However, letter 'P 8', the response sent to the Petitioner by the

Information Officer of GHS, Kandy, does not include the information requested by

the Petitioner regarding the marks obtained by his child. The letter states that

copies of the rejection letters are not retained, and thus the requested information

cannot be provided. If comprehensive records had been maintained as required,

there should have been no difficulty in providing this information. Therefore, the

only reasonable inferences the Court can draw are that either the 1st Respondent

failed to comply with the Circular, constituting a procedural error, or they avoided

providing the information because it was adverse to the Respondents.

Analysis

According to the Petitioner, they are baptised Christians6. The Petitioner asserts

that there are no other schools teaching non-Roman Catholic Christianity in the

area, and GHS, Kandy is the only school within the feeder area where the

Petitioners child can be admitted, as per Circular No. 29/2019. Clause 4.7 of the

Circular states that the feeder area for GHS, Kandy encompasses the entire

administrative District.

The Respondent denied this claim, stating that there are other Christian schools in

the area, including St. Anthonys Girls College, Kandy, and Ampitiya Berrewaerts

College7. However, it is important to note that the Respondents did not consider

these two schools when deducing marks for the other nearby schools and instead

considered seven other schools stated below in this judgement. Hence, I am of the

view that the interview panel has acted irrationally.

6 P 9 and P 9A. 7 Paragraph 10 (a) of the objections.

8 CA/WRT/0294/2020

Nonetheless, the Petitioner categorically denied the above contention, stating that

there are no other schools in the feeder area, aside from GHS, Kandy8, that admit

10% or more non-Roman Catholic Christian students.

Since the Respondent argued that the Petitioner failed to establish residence and

therefore, the Petitioners child could not be admitted under the proximity

category, it is crucial for this Court to consider the marks awarded to the Petitioner

by the interview panel. The Petitioner received only 15 out of 50 marks for

proximity. The interview panel purportedly deducted 5 marks each for the seven

schools mentioned in 'P 6', following Clause 7.2.4 of the Circular. Clause 7.2.4

defines that schools with a primary section to which the child could be admitted

are those with the desired medium of study, girls', boys', or mixed schools as it is

applicable to the child, and that admit 10% or more children from the child's

religion. However, the interview panel arbitrarily decided, as reflected in the

document marked '1 R 7', to consider all schools with a primary section when

deducting marks for other available schools in the proximity. The learned Counsel

for the Petitioner contended that none of these schools teach non-Roman Catholic

Christianity or admit 10% or more students from the child's religion. The learned

Deputy Solicitor General did not dispute this position in her submission, and there

are no other materials before the Court that contradict the Petitioners learned

Counsel's above submission. Hence, I am inclined to accept this as correct.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued with utmost confidence that, in

accordance with Clause 3.2 of Circular No. 29/2019, GHS, Kandy is obliged to

admit his child to the school.

Admittedly, GHS, Kandy was vested to the Government under Gazette

Notification (Extraordinary) No. 12,839 dated 30th December 19619, at which time

the school had a total of 968 students. Of these, 373 were Christian students: 81

were Methodists and the remaining 292 belonged to other denominations of

8 Paragraph 11 of the counter affidavit. 9 1 R 4.

9 CA/WRT/0294/2020

Christianity10. Accordingly, Christians comprised 38% of the student population,

with 8% being Methodists and 30% belonging to other denominations.

Additionally, at that time, the school had approximately 5.8% Hindu students,

48% Buddhist students, and 7% Muslim students.

The number of students admitted to Grade 1 for the year 2020 is 17511. The

Respondent stated that out of these 175 students, 25 were admitted based on their

parents' service in operational areas, the Sri Lanka Police, or the three-Armed

Forces.

The quota allocated to the Sri Lanka Police and the three-Armed Forces is

categorised under Clause 13 of Circular No. 29/2019. According to Clause 13, a

special concessionary quota is granted to the Sri Lanka Police and the three-

Armed Forces, with five children to be admitted to each Grade 1 class under this

scheme. The Respondents stated that there were five Grade 1 classes in total in the

year 2020. Therefore, admitting 25 children based on this criterion is in

accordance with Circular No. 29/2019.

The Petitioner claimed that based on the proportion existing at the time the school

was vested to the Government, a total of 72 Christian students12 should have been

admitted to GHS, Kandy for the year 2020. However, in the written submission

filed by the Petitioner, the learned Counsel submitted that out of the total 175

seats, 50% of them, amounting to 87 seats, should be allocated to the 'close

proximity category' as per Clause 7.1 of the Circular. Furthermore, out of these 87

seats, 38%, which is 33 seats, should be allocated to Christian students.

Specifically, according to Circular No. 29/2019, this allocation should consist of

8% Methodist students and 30% students of other denominations of Christianity,

totalling 38% of Christian students.

10 1R5 and P 10. 11 Paragraph 21 of the Petition and paragraph 12 (e) of the objections. 12 Paragraph 22 of the Petition.

10 CA/WRT/0294/2020

The Respondent states that the seats allocated to the 'close proximity' category was

75, which is 50% of 15013, a point which I concede. After admitting 25 children

from the Sri Lanka Police and three Armed Forces, as per Clause 13 of Circular,

the remaining seats for the categories mentioned under Clause 3 amount to only

150. Among these, 50% should be allocated to the 'close proximity' category14,

resulting in 75 seats. Accordingly, 38%, or 28 students, should be admitted from

the Christian community. Within this 38% of Christian students, 8% should be

Methodists and 30% from other Christian denominations.

However, the Respondent contends that the school has consistently admitted only

8% Christian students, and therefore, admitted 6 students who met the criteria.

Based on this established ratio, the Respondent argues that GHS Kandy does not

qualify as a school admitting 10% or more Christian students, as per Clause 7.2.4

of Circular. Therefore, the Respondent asserts that GHS, Kandy is entitled to

deduct marks for each school within the feeder area. However, this argument lacks

merit since the correct ratio for admission of Christian students should have been

38% and not 8%.

As I have analysed above, it is evident that the Petitioner's application for the

admission of their child to GHS, Kandy falls under the category of 'close

proximity'15. Clause 4.2 of Circular, stipulates that in admitting students to a

school vested to the state under the Assisted Schools and Training Colleges

(Special Provisions) Act No. 5 of 1960 and Assisted Schools and Training

Colleges (Supplementary Provisions) Act No. 8 of 1961, available vacancies

should be divided according to the specified categories and religions outlined in

the Circular. Clause 9.1.1 further specifies that the interview panel of a school

where religious basis is applicable must first seek applications according to

religion before examining them16.

13 Paragraph 12 (g) of the objections. 14Clause 7.1 i. 15 Clause 3.1 of the Circular No. 29/2019 (1R1). 16 Clause 4.2.

11 CA/WRT/0294/2020

If there are fewer applicants than the number allocated to a specific religious

sector, the remaining slots should be proportionally distributed among candidates

from different sectors within the same religion. Should there be no candidates or

insufficient numbers to fill the allotted slots, those vacancies should then be

proportionally distributed among applicants from other religions.

Close Proximity Category

Under this category, the aerial distance from the applicant's residence to the school

is taken into consideration. If there are no other primary schools to which the child

could be admitted, the applicant should receive the full 50 marks17. However, if

there are other government schools closer to the residence, 5 marks should be

deducted for each such school. According to the definition provided in Clause

7.2.4, schools to which the child could be admitted include those with the desired

medium of study, whether they are girls', boys', or mixed schools, as applicable to

the child. Additionally, these schools must admit 10% or more children from the

religion to which the child belongs.

The Respondents argued that the Petitioner failed to establish residence based on

the fact that the Petitioner only obtained 32 marks, falling short of the cutoff marks

of 35% out of 100 as indicated in the documents marked 1R7. However, as I

have already observed regarding the deduction of marks for every school having a

primary section within the feeder area, this decision is arbitrary by the interview

panel since there is no rule in the Circular authorizing such action.

Cutoff mark

While the Circular does provide provision for the panel of interview to shortlist

applicants, it does not include any provision to impose a cutoff mark18. The cutoff

mark cannot be set up in advance. The cutoff mark should be determined

according to the slots available in the school for the relevant year.

17 Clause 7.2.4. 18 Clause 9.3.

12 CA/WRT/0294/2020

As per Clause 9.1.2 of Circular, the number of applicants called for the interview

should be four times the number of available slots. Petitioner has successfully

overcome this hurdle. Following the interview, a list of applicants, ranked from

highest to lowest marks obtained, must be prepared, and the marks of the child

whose name appears last among the available slots should serve as the cutoff

mark.

Therefore, introducing a pass mark of 35% by the panel of interviewers through

the document marked 1R7 is also arbitrary.

Allocation of Marks

For the documents

The Petitioner was granted 12.5 marks out of 25 for registering their name in the

electoral register, a main document according to the Circular19. Since only the

Petitioner's name was registered, the interview panel followed the Circular's

guidelines and awarded the allotted marks accordingly.

Under the category of other documents for proof of residence, 1.5 marks were

allocated for water bills, electricity bills, and the agreement (P 5(a)). However,

it's noted that the agreement P 5(a) does not fall within the same category as water

and electricity bills. Instead, it could be considered under a distinct category where

applicants could earn 5 marks if they possess a certificate issued by the Municipal

Commissioner in their name.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued20 that by presenting the agreement

between the Petitioners father and the Municipal Council of Kandy, the Petitioner

is entitled to the marks allocated for such a document. However, the Circular

explicitly states that if such a certificate is not in the name of the applicant, marks

should not be awarded. Since 'P 5(a)' is in the name of the Petitioner's father, the

Petitioner is not entitled to the 5 marks.

19 Clause 7.2.2. 20 At paragraph 21 of the Written submission.

13 CA/WRT/0294/2020

Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, while the Petitioner is entitled to 0.5 marks

each for the electricity bills and water bills in accordance with Clause 7.2.1.1 of

the Circular, the Petitioner is not eligible for the 0.5 marks assigned for the

agreement P 5(a).

However, the Petitioner should have been awarded marks for presenting his birth

certificate21, which serves as proof of residence. Additionally, the panel of

interviewers granted an additional 3 marks under the additional documents

category, as the Petitioner provided their national identity card22, marriage

certificate23, childs birth certificate24, and bank passbook25. According to Clause

7.2.1.2, the Petitioner should have received 4 marks for these 4 documents but was

awarded only 3 marks.

Consequently, the marks earned by the Petitioner for the documents should be 18,

but only 17 marks were allotted.

For the proximity

The Petitioner's child received only 15 marks out of 50 for the proximity to the

school26. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner argued that since GHS, Kandy is

the only Christian girls school admitting 10% or more Christian students as per

the Circular, the Petitioner is entitled to the full 50 marks under the proximity

category. However, the Respondents countered this by stating that there are seven

other schools available for the Petitioners child, namely Viharamahadevi,

Rasingdev, Gothami, Mahamaya, Hemamali, Badi Ud Din, and Presidents

College27. As I have already stated above in this judgment, the Petitioner denied

that these schools admit 10% or more Christian children.

21 P 5(e). 22 P 2. 23 P 5(c). 24 P 1. 25 P 5(l) 26 Vide P 6. 27 P6 and 1R3.

14 CA/WRT/0294/2020

Consequently, it was argued by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that the

Petitioner is entitled to the full 50 marks under the proximity category, increasing

the total marks to sixty-seven, thus making his child eligible for admission to

GHS, Kandy under the proximity category, subject to the religious quota.

Based on the analysis provided above, I concede that the Petitioner should have

been awarded the full marks of 50 under the proximity to school category.

Additionally, as per the previous analysis, they are entitled to 18 marks. Therefore,

the Petitioner should have received a total of 68 marks, which exceeds the

purported cutoff mark.

The Respondents have not disclosed the cutoff mark of the 150th child, the last one

admitted to the school. The 50% of this number, which amounts to seventy-five,

must be allocated to the proximity category as per Clause 7.1 of Circular. Out of

these seventy-five seats, 38% of them, which is 28 seats, must be allocated to

Christian students. Within this 38%, 30% of the seats, totalling 22, must be

allocated to non-Methodist Christians like the Petitioner, while 8% should be

allocated to Methodists, amounting to six seats.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the Respondent argued that as per Clause

6.2.6 the interview panel has the authority to make decisions regarding the

admission of students to the school. However, it's important to note that the same

Clause specifies that student admissions should be in accordance with the Circular.

The discretion granted to the interview panel is intended for considering all

relevant factors and arriving at suitable decisions, within the framework of the

Circular. Therefore, in my opinion, the discretion afforded to the interview panel

under Clause 6.2.6 is not unrestricted, but rather aimed at making and

implementing appropriate decisions within the confines of the Circular. Thus,

from my perspective, the interview panel has overstepped the bounds of discretion

afforded to them by the circular, thereby abusing the discretion.

15 CA/WRT/0294/2020

The learned Deputy Solicitor General cited the judgment of Aluwihare P.C., J. in

the case of R.M. Dayawathi v. The Principal, Girls' High School Kandy and three

others28, where His Lordship held that the religious quota is a special factor for

consideration and not a separate tier of admission. Accordingly, it was argued that

the Petitioners application must be considered under the proximity to the school

category.

As I have analysed above in this judgment, no doubt can exist the Petitioners

application falls under the proximity category29. The religious basis is not a

separate category but a factor that should operate within each category, subject to

the percentages that existed when the schools were vested to the government.

As outlined above in this judgment, the Petitioners grievance is that his child was

not admitted to GHS, Kandy under the proximity category, considering the

religious quota.

In the case of B. M. Asiri Tharanga and another v. the Principal, Kingswood

College, Kandy and three others30 Her Ladyship Eva Wanasundara PC. J.,

observed as follows;

If the documents show that he is a Christian and if the number of Christian

children already admitted are not above the allowed percentage () under the

religious category, then that child has a right to be admitted under Clause 3.2 of

the Circular.

No body can ignore the law provided by two statutes of Parliament, namely, Act

No. 5 of 1960 and Act No. 9 of 1961. The school authorities and the Ministry of

Education cannot turn a blind eye to the provisions of law already in force.

I am unable to find any statutory provision in the Assisted Schools and Training

Colleges Act No. 5 of 1960, Act No. 9 of 1961, or the Assisted Schools and

28 S.C. Application No 459/17 (FR). 29 Paragraph 2 of the Respondents written submission. 30 SC/FR application No. 335/2016.

16 CA/WRT/0294/2020

Training Colleges (Amendment) Act No. 65 of 1961 that mandates maintaining

the religious ratio that existed when the schools were vested with the government.

Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has clearly emphasized that the provisions in the

Circular regarding the religious basis must be implemented.

Conclusion

In light of the analysis provide in this judgement, there is no evidence that the

number of applicants exceeded the number of seats allotted to Christian students

under the proximity category. As previously stated in this judgment, the number

allotted to Christian students in GHS, Kandy should have been 28, whereas GHS,

Kandy allocated only 6 seats. Therefore, under Clause 4.2 of Circular, the

Petitioners child is entitled to be admitted to GHS, Kandy as a matter of right.

Consequently, this Court is inclined to grand the writ of mandamus prayed for in

prayer (b) of the Petition directing the 1st and 3rd Respondents to enrol the

Petitioners child Udayasooriyan Onelia Steffani to the Girls High School,

Kandy.
