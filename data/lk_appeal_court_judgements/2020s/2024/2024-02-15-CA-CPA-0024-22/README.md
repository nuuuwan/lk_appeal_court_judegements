Argued on: 17.01.2023

Decided on: 15.02.2023

MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant application for revision has been filed to set aside the order dated 3.2.2022

of the High Court of Negombo.

The petitioner had been arrested while driving a motor vehicle and on inspection

police had detected a substance similar to be heroin in the trouser pocket of the

petitioner on 25.7.2020 and upon producing the petitioner before the Magistrate he

had been remanded under the provisions of the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs

act on 20.7.2020 and the petitioner had been in remand ever since.

The Government Analyst report had been received by the Magistrate on 15.2.2021

and 17 grams of heroin had been detected from the substance recovered from the

custody of the petitioner.

The main grouse of the petitioner is that he has been in remand for over a period of

two years without the due administration of justice taking place against him. He

further averred that it is over a period of one year since the receipt of the Government

Analyst report.

The Counsel for the Respondents objected to the application purely on the basis of

nonexistence of exceptional circumstances.

The law pertaining to this matter is that if a suspect or accused is produced under the

provisions of the instant act and if it is under section 54 A and B the said suspect or

accused can be released on bail if the quantity is over 10 grams by the Court of Appeal

only upon exceptional circumstances.

The exceptionality urged in this matter is the delay in due administration of justice

taking place against the petitioner.

This Court draws its attention to the case of CA (PHC) APN No 16/12 in which Justice

Sisira De Abrew has held that for an allegation of 3.59 grams of heroin his Lordship

has held that the suspect being in remand for over a period of one year even after the

issuance of the Government Analyst report is exceptional enough to consider bail for

the suspect.

In the instant matter we observe that although the Government Analyst report has

been received due administration of justice has not taken place hence it is the

considered view of this Court that the instant application for revision should be

allowed and we direct the learned High Court Judge to enlarge the petitioner on

suitable conditions of bail.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal.
