Therefore, the fact that the holder's interest is converted from a Permit to a grant does not alter any nomination previously made by the holder to the relevant authority. Consequently, any nomination of a successor under the Permit should be considered as transferred to the Grant. Justice J.A.N. de Silva, then of the Court of Appeal, in the case of Nanayakkara v.

Furthermore, in my view the 1st to 4th Respondents have lawfully alienated the land initially assigned to the late Joseph Selliah through lease agreements to the 5th and 7th to 10th Respondents. As a result, there are no valid reasons to issue a writ of certiorari to annul the decision contained in 'P 20' to lease the land to the 5th and 7th to 10th Respondents, nor is there justification for issuing a writ of mandamus to allocate the land to Joseph Selliah's surviving children through lease or other legal means.",
