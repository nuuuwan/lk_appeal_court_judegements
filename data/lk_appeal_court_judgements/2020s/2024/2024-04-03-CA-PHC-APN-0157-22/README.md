******************************

JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Complainant-Respondent-Responded (Hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) had filed a charge sheet Under Section 46(a) and 54(2) of

the Excise Ordinance against the Accused in the Magistrate Court of

Welisara. As the Accused pleaded guilty to the charge sheet, the Learned

Magistrate of Welisara had convicted the Accused and imposed a fine of

Rs.75,000/- and fixed for an inquiry to confiscate the Vehicle bearing No.

WP PI-6212.

At the conclusion of the inquiry, the Learned Magistrate had decided to

confiscate the aforesaid vehicle by his order dated 12th February 2020.

At the inquiry the Accused and the Petitioner had given evidence.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Petitioner filed a

revision application in the Provincial High Court of Western Holden at

Negombo to revise the order of the Magistrate of Welisara. After support,

the Learned High Court Judge had issued notice to the Respondent and

the matter was fixed for argument. After the inquiry, the Learned High

court Judge had dismissed the said revision application. Now the

Petitioner filed this revision application to set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of Negombo dated 21/10/2022. At present

CA (PHC) APN 157/2022

5 | P a g e

the vehicle in question was released to the Petitioner on a bond of value

of Rs. 500,000/- pending inquiry.

The Appellant submitted following grounds of appeal:

i. The said judgement is contrary to the facts, materials, evidence

placed before the Magistrate Court and the circumstances of this

case;

ii. The learned Judge of the Provincial High Court and the learned

Magistrate has misdirected themselves by concluding that the

petitioner had failed to take precautions to prevent the vehicle

being used for commission of the said vehicle;

iii. The learned Magistrate and the learned judge of the Provincial High

Court misdirected themselves by failing to appreciate that the

Petitioner had no knowledge or involvement in the said vehicle

being used for commission of the said offence.

iv. The learned judge of the Provincial High Court misdirected himself

has misdirected himself by dismissing the said application of the

Petitioner on the delay on the part of the Petitioner, whereas the

Petitioner had explained the delay in making the said application

and for the said order of the learned Magistrate was ab initio void;

v. The learned Magistrate and the learned judge of the Provincial High

Court misdirected themselves by failing to evaluate the evidence

led at the said inquiry in the correct manner to, which satisfied the

Magistrate Court to release and discharge the said vehicle from

confiscation.

vi. Grave miscarriage of justice has caused by the said order of the

learned Magistrate and the order of the learned judge of the

Provincial High Court marked P2;

vii. The said judgment is palpably wrong.

It is settled law that revision is a discretionary remedy, and such power

shall be invoked only upon demonstration of exceptional circumstances.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In Marian Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed 69 CLW 34 the court held that:

Power of revision is an extraordinary power of the court

which is independent and distinct from the appellate

jurisdiction. The object of revisionary jurisdiction is to ensure

the due administration of justice and the correction of all

errors in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice.

In the case of Rasheed Ali v.Mohammed Ali and Others [1981] 1 SLR

262, the court held that:

the powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are

very wide and the Court can in a fit case exercise that power

whether or not an appeal lies. When, however, the law does

not give a right of appeal and makes the order final, the Court

CA (PHC) APN 157/2022

7 | P a g e

of Appeal may nevertheless exercise its powers of revision,

but it should do so only in exceptional circumstances.

Ordinarily the Court will not interfere by way of review,

particularly when the law has expressly given an aggrieved

party an alternative remedy such as the right to file a separate

action, except when non-interference will cause a denial of

justice or irremediable harm.

In Commissioner of Police v. Tanes (1957-58) 68 CLR 383, the court

held that:

"It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone can

be punished or prejudiced in his person or his property by any

judicial or quasi-judicial procedure, he must be afforded

adequate opportunity of being heard ... "

In this case the Learned High Court Judge only considering the order of

the Magistrate Court of Welisara decided to dismiss the revision

application stating that that the Petitioner had failed shock the conscious

of the court.

In this case a car had been confiscated for transporting 562,500 ml of

illicit liquor.

The Petitioner has given evidence in the court and has claimed that she

was unaware of the crime being committed as she has given the vehicle

on rent to the Nishan Tours, a rent a car company by an agreement

marked X1 for a monthly rental of Rs.40,000/- for a period commencing

from 11/12/2018 to 11/06/2019.

The said rent a car company had given the same on rent to the Accused

on an agreement marked X2 for the period commencing from

10.03.2019 to 10.04.2019 and the said agreement had been extended by

CA (PHC) APN 157/2022

8 | P a g e

an employee of the said Nishan Tours at the request of the Accused by a

phone call.

The Learned Magistrate has dismissed the application on the basis that

the Petitioner had failed to show that she took all necessary precautions

to prevent a crime being committed.

In this case the owner of the vehicle, the Petitioner had given evidence in

court. According to her, she had given the vehicle to Nishan Torus on a

rent. Her husband Chaminda Pushpakumara is the person who handled

the transaction and supervised the vehicle on her behalf.

Chaminda Pushpakumara also gave evidence and corroborated the

evidence given by the Petitioner.

The Owner of the Nishan Tours also gave evidence and corroborated the

evidence gave by husband of the Petitioner.

In this case the Petitioner had legally entered into an agreement with

Nishan Tours and rented her vehicle which is the subject matter of this

case. Further she made supervision through her husband about the

movement of the vehicle and she also called the Nishan Tours to check

her vehicle. Nishan Tours had re-rented the vehicle as per the agreement

and the incident had happened without the knowledge of the Petitioner.

Hence, the Learned Magistrate simply dismissing the application on the

basis that the Petitioner had failed to show cause that she took all

necessary precautions to prevent a crime being committed is not correct

in this case.

Endorsing the finding of Learned Magistrate, the Learned High Court

Judge had failed to consider the evidence adduced on behalf of the

Petitioner properly.

Hence, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Negombo

dated 21.10.2022 and the order of Learned Magistrate of Welisara dated

12.02.2020.

Therefore, the revision application is allowed.

I direct that the vehicle No. WP-PI-6212 be released to the Petitioner.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgment to the High

Court of Negombo and the Magistrate Court of Welisara.
