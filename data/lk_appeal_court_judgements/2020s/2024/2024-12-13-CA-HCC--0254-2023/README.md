about Rs.2,0175,500/- and Rs.2,930,000/- respectively for sale. The

relevant dates for second and third charges are 05.04.2008 and 24.04.2008

respectively.

The learned High Court Judge after closure of the prosecution case, called

for the defence as he had found sufficient evidence to answer a case by the

Appellant. The Appellant informed Court that he was going to give evidence

and to call three witnesses on his behalf. Accordingly, the Appellant gave

evidence and concluded his evidence on 02.08.2019. On that day the defence

Counsel informed the Court of the Appellants willingness to tender a guilty

plea and conclude the matter. Accordingly, the Appellant pleaded guilty to

all the charges on 07.07.2023.

After considering all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the

case, the learned High Court Judge imposed the following sentence to the

Appellant on 10.08.2023.

For the 1st Count the Appellant was sentenced to 08 months rigorous

imprisonment and suspended the same for 15 years. A fine of

Rs.20,000/- was imposed subject to 03 months default sentence.

Acting under Section 17(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15

of 1979, a compensation of Rs.1,000,000/- was ordered to pay the

widow of PW1, Jayasinghe Arachchige Septiman Sunil Baratha Perera

with a default sentence of 02 years.

For the 2nd Count the Appellant was sentenced to 08 months rigorous

imprisonment and suspended the same for 15 years. A fine of

Rs.20,000/- was imposed subject to 03 months default sentence.

Acting under Section 17(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15

of 1979, a compensation of Rs.1,500,000/- was ordered to pay to the

widow of PW1, Jayasinghe Arachchige Septiman Sunil Baratha Perera

with a default sentence of 02 years.

For the 3rd Count the Appellant was sentenced to 08 months rigorous

imprisonment and suspended the same for 15 years. A fine of

Rs.20,000/- was imposed subject to 03 months default sentence.

Acting under Section 17(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15

of 1979, a compensation of Rs.2,500,000/- was ordered to pay to the

widow of PW1, Jayasinghe Arachchige Septiman Sunil Baratha Perera

with a default sentence of 02 years.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid sentence only, the Appellant preferred this

appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

is on bail and has given consent to argue this matter in his absence.

Back ground of the case

In this case the Appellant had involved in gem business during the period

mentioned in the indictment.PW1 was also involved in gem business and had

handed over the gems worth about Rs.6,192,500/- to the Appellant on the

promise that he would pay back the Appellant the sale money. Although the

Appellant had given 08 cheques, all had been bounced upon tendering to the

bank.

As the Appellant pleaded guilty to the indictment, it is not necessary to

consider the evidence led in the trial.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant mainly argued that the compensation

imposed on the Appellant is excessive considering the old age of the

Appellant. It is pertinent to mention that the Appellant did not challenge the

conviction.

CA/HCC/0254/23

In Dhananjoy Chatterjee v State of W.B. (1994) 2 SCC 220 the Court held

that:

The imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which the

Court respond to the societys cry for justice against the criminal. Justice

demand that Court should impose punishment befitting the crime so that

the Courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime.

In Sevaka Perumal etc v State of Tamil Nadu (1991) AIR SC 1463 the Court

held that:

Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to

the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law

and society could not long endure under such serious threats. It is therefore

the duty of every Court to award proper sentence having regard to the

nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or

committed etc.

When the learned High Court Judge passed the sentence, he had considered

all the submissions made by both parties. The learned High Court Judge had

considered the age of the Appellant and the other cases filed against him.

Further, the learned High Court Judge had very correctly considered the

sorry plight of the wife of PW1. PW1 had passed away after giving evidence

in the High Court.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge has considered the submissions

made by both parties very correctly before passing the sentence. He had

given plausible reasons as to why he passed this sentence.

Hence it is wrong to say that the Learned High Court Judge was

predetermined and passed an excessive sentence.

Considering all the evidence presented during the trial, and the submissions

made I conclude that this not an appropriate case in which to interfere with

the decision of Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 10/08/2023.

Hence, I dismiss this appeal.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of Colombo

along with the original case record.
