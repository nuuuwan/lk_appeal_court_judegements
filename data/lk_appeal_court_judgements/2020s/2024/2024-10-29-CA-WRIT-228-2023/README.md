This is an application filed by the Petitioner by the amended petition seeking to quash

the quit notice issued by the 1st Respondent dated 29.09.2022 marked as P17 and to order

the 1st Respondent to permit the Petitioner to re-enter the quarters bearing Assessment

number 483/1, Jeremias Fernando Mawatha, Rawatawatta, Moratuwa.

According to the petition filed on 03.05.2024, the Petitioner has sought for a writ of

prohibition, prohibiting the 1st Respondent and the Registrar of Magistrate Court

Moratuwa from proceeding with action No.05176 instituted before the Magistrates Court

of Moratuwa and issue a stay order until a final determination of the application

restraining the 1st Respondent and the Registrar of Magistrate Court Moratuwa from

proceeding with the writ of possession dated 28.03.2023 issued by the Learned Magistrate

of Moratuwa.

According to the Petitioner, the Petitioner worked at the Western Province Provincial

Road Development Authority in the capacity of Chief Internal Auditor from 02.01.2006 to

23.09.2015. After reaching 60 years of age, the Petitioner continued to work in the same

capacity as a Chief Internal Auditor in the said Authority on a contractual basis from

29.05.2015 to 27.04.2019. Somewhere in 2008, the Petitioner has requested the Authority

for government quarters and the Petitioner was granted permission for the said quarters

by the said Authority. At the end of the said agreement, the Petitioner has requested for

a three months extension to stay in the said quarters which was allowed. Again, by letter

dated 18.07.2019, the Petitioner has further requested for an extension of another three

months. The 1st Respondent, the Chairman has indicated to the Petitioner by letter dated

10.06.2020 marked as 1R7, informing the Petitioner to hand over the said quarters. In

reply to that letter, by letter dated 23.06.2020, the Petitioner requested for a further 6

months extension to stay in the said quarters on the basis that he was receiving treatment

at a hospital in Katubedda. Thereafter, on 05.01.2021, the Chairman sent another letter

to the Petitioner to vacate the said premises. In reply to the said letter, by letter dated

05.01.2021, the Petitioner requested to stay further in the quarters due to the Covid-19

pandemic.

By letter dated 01.03.2021, the 1st Respondent requested the Petitioner to vacate the

premises on or before 31.03.2021. Thereafter, the Chairman issued a quit notice under

the Government Quarters Recovery of Possession Act No. 7 of 1969 on 29.09.2022 and

filed the papers in the Magistrates Court of Moratuwa bearing case No. 05176 praying

for the recovery of the said quarters and ejection of the Petitioner. Upon the receipt of the

application for ejection, the Learned Magistrate issued a writ of possession on 28.03.2023.

The main ground urged by the Petitioner is that, the Quit Notice was not issued by a

competent authority.

We are mindful that, the particular quarters was given by the 1st Respondent by letter

marked 1R2. According to Section 9 of the Government Quarters Recovery of Possession

Act, a competent authority includes, the Secretary to the Ministry charged with the

subject of Public Administration or any public officer authorized by such Secretary to be

a competent authority.

We are also mindful that, after the retirement in 2015 as a government servant, the 1st

Respondent has given several extensions to the Petitioner to stay in the said quarters.

This Court notes that, the government quarters are designated for the accommodation of

the public servants. By this application, the Petitioner deprives the public officers who

are in need of such accommodation.

In any event, the Learned Magistrate has issued a writ of possession and the Petitioner

was dispossessed by the order. The Petitioner has failed to challenge the particular order

made by the Learned Magistrate.

The Petitioner has also failed to show that, the Chairman did not have the authority to

issue notice.

We observe that, the Respondents have given sufficient time for the Petitioner to occupy

the quarters even after his retirement.

Therefore, we hold that, there are no reasons to issue notices to the Respondents as the

1st Respondent has followed the proper procedure when issuing the Quit Notice.

For the aforementioned reason, we dismiss the application with costs.
