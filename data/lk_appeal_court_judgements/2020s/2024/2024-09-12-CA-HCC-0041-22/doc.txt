The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Gampaha for

committing grave sexual abuse of a girl below the age of 16 years on or

about 02nd June 2013 by inserting his tongue to the female genitalia of

the victim and thereby committing an offence punishable under section

365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code. After trial, the learned High Court Judge

convicted the accused by his Judgment dated 30.11.2021 and

sentenced him for 10 years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine

of Rs.25,000/- which carries a default sentence of 06 months simple

imprisonment. Further, compensation of Rs.100,000/- which carries a

default sentence of 01-year simple imprisonment was also ordered.

This appeal is preferred against the said conviction and sentence. Prior

to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of both parties.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned counsel for the appellant and

the learned Senior State Counsel for the respondent made oral

submissions.

In brief, the facts of the prosecution case are as follows:

At the time of the incident, the victim was a seven-year-old girl who had

been living with her parents and three sisters in Ragama. She was

Page 3 of 12

fourteen years old at the time of giving evidence. On the day of the

alleged abuse, which was a Sunday, the victim had attended dhamma

school and came to her home around 11.30 a.m. After having her

lunch, she had gone to the well, which was located near her house.

According to the victim (PW-1), when she was near the well, the

accused-appellant who was living in the adjacent land to the victims

house had come to that place. The victim had just come out of the toilet

and came near the well and she had not been wearing any clothes for

her lower part of the body at that time. According to PW-1, at this

instance, the accused had kissed the genital area of the victim using

his mouth.

The learned Counsel for the appellant has raised following three

grounds of appeal in his written submissions.

i. The learned Trial Judge had failed to evaluate the evidence

properly and failed to apply the legal principles.

ii. The findings of the learned High Court Judge are not

supported and contrary to the evidence of PW-1.

iii. Hon. High Court Judge had failed to evaluate the required

legal elements of the offence of grave sexual abuse and

convicted the appellant for the said offence.

Although the aforesaid grounds of appeal have been raised in the

written submissions, at the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel

for the appellant mainly relied upon a legal issue. He contended that

due to the said legal issue, the conviction cannot stand. The legal issue

that he raised is that the learned Judge who wrote the Judgment has

never heard the evidence of the case and according to Section 283(1) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (CCPA), the Judgment shall be

written by the Judge who heard the case. Since the learned High Court

Judge who wrote the Judgment had never heard the case, the learned

Counsel for the appellant contended that the conviction cannot stand.

Page 4 of 12

Further written submissions have been filed on behalf of the respondent

in respect of the aforesaid legal issue.

Section 283(1) of the CCPA reads as follows:

The judgment shall be written by the Judge who heard the case and

shall be dated and signed by him in open court at the time of pronouncing

it, and in case where appeal lies shall contain the point or points for

determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for the decision.

In the instant case, the trial had been commenced before the learned

High Court Judge, Hon. Nimal Ranaweera. The prosecution evidence

was lead before him and the accused-appellant made a statement from

the dock before the same Judge. After the case was fixed for closing

submissions of both parties, Hon. Navaratne Marasinghe was

appointed as the Judge of this High Court. When the matter came

before Hon. Navaratne Marasinghe, the learned Counsel for the accused

made an application to proceed the case before Hon. Navaratne

Marasinghe adopting the evidence led before his predecessor. The

learned High Court Judge made his order stating that he decides to

proceed with the case, as it was agreed to adopt the evidence so far led

and to proceed thereon. The application of the learned defence counsel

and the order made by the learned High Court Judge appear as follow:

(page 96 of appeal brief)

The contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant was that even

if the Counsel for the accused requested to adopt the evidence and

proceed, the learned High Court Judge should have referred the case

back to his predecessor to write the Judgment because Section 283(1)

states that the Judgment shall be written by the Judge who heard the

case. The learned Counsel submitted the case of Nimal Pinsiri

Godakandeniyage alias Nimal pinsiri V. Hon. Attorney General

Court of Appeal No. CA 77/2014, decided on 18th November 2019, in

substantiating his argument and pointed out that the said case has

been sent back for retrial. In the case of Nimal Pinsiri V. Attorney

General, the learned Counsel for the appellant raised an argument and

stated that the accused-appellant had been seriously prejudiced

because the evidence for the prosecution and the defence had been led

before one Judge of the Court and the evidence had been considered

and the Judgment had been pronounced by a different Judge of the

High Court.

It is correct that the aforesaid case submitted by the learned Counsel

for the appellant has been sent back for retrial by the Court of Appeal.

However, the reason for sending back the case was not that the evidence

of the case has not been heard by the Judge who wrote the Judgment.

The reason was that the learned Judge has never considered the

accuseds dock statement. It was observed by the Court of Appeal that

in the Judgment, the learned High Court Judge had made no reference

at all to the dock statement made by the accused. As the Court of

Appeal concluded that the learned High Court Judge has arrived at the

finding of guilt only upon considering the evidence led by the

prosecution, the Judgment of the High Court had been set aside and

the case was sent back for retrial. It must be specifically mentioned that

Page 6 of 12

there is no single word in that Judgment to the effect that a Judgment

cannot be entered by the succeeding Judge considering and analyzing

the evidence led before his predecessor.

In addition, it is apparent from that Court of Appeal Judgment that the

succeeding Judge can write a Judgment considering the evidence taken

by his predecessor even if no evidence is led before the succeeding

Judge because in the said Court of Appeal Judgment it has been

mentioned that the learned High Court Judge should have referred to

the nature of the dock statement made by the accused, pronounced his

decision to reject the dock statement and given reasons for the rejection

of the dock statement. This finding of the Court of Appeal decision

clearly implies that a succeeding Judge who did not hear any evidence

of the case can enter the Judgment on the evidence led before his

predecessor but the entirety of the evidence including the dock

statement should be considered and analyzed in writing the Judgment.

Therefore, the said judicial authority submitted by the learned Counsel

for the appellant is against the argument formulated by the learned

Counsel.

Presently, the legal position regarding the adoption of evidence is

settled. In the case of Somapala V. The Commissioner to Investigate

Bribery and Corruption- (CA (PHC) APN 37/2009, CA Minutes of

03.02.2010), it was observed that the legislature repealed the proviso

to Section 48 of the Judicature Act and substituted thereof, of the

following proviso by Judicature (Amendment) Act No. 27 of 1999:

Provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding or matter

(except on an inquiry preliminary to committal for trial) is continued before

the successor of any such Judge, the accused may demand that the

witnesses be re-summoned and reheard.

Citing the aforesaid Court of Appeal Judgment, the Supreme Court

observed in the SC Appeal No: SC/APPEAL/139/2019 (The Hon.

Page 7 of 12

Attorney General V. Chandana Sri Lal Gurusinghe), SC Appeal No:

SC/APPEAL/2/2022 (Hettiarachchilage Wasantha Rathna V. OIC

Yakkala Police Station and The Hon. Attorney General) and SC SPL

LA No: SC/SPL/LA/267/2018 (Rajapakse Gedara Nandasena alias

kirikolla V. The Hon. Attorney General) decided on 05.04.2024 as

follows:

This amendment removed the right of the parties to civil actions to

demand the resummoning and rehearing of witnesses. Following the

amendment, this right is now confined only to accused persons in

criminal cases.

This amendment also restricted the accuseds rights, which he previously

enjoyed. After the amendment, there is no compulsion on the part of the

Court to resummon and rehear witnesses and commence the trial afresh

when an application is made by the accused; the part in which case the

trial shall commence afresh found in the original proviso was removed.

By removing that portion, the legislature granted the Court the discretion

to decide whether to allow the accuseds application to resummon and

rehear witnesses, based on the facts and circumstances of each

individual case.

Accordingly, the Supreme Court decided the following two questions of

law in negative:

(a) Does a Court of first instant require the fact of adopting evidence

by the succeeding Judge to be recorded in order to comply with

Section 48 of the Judicature Act, as amended, when there was no

demand by accused person to resummon and rehear the

witnesses?

(b) Would the Cout of Appeal be correct in law in holding that the

absence of a record of adoption of evidence in the above

circumstances vitiates the proceedings, without considering the

matter before it?

Page 8 of 12

Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the succeeding Judge can

proceed with the case adopting the evidence taken by his predecessor

even without recording the adoption of evidence when there is no

demand by an accused person to resummon and rehear the witnesses.

However, it is to be noted that it is advisable to record the consent of

the parties whenever the evidence is adopted and then proceed before

the succeeding Judge.

The issue before us is slightly different. The argument raised by the

learned Counsel for the appellant was that the learned Judge who wrote

the Judgment has never heard even a part of the evidence of the case,

and all the evidence of the case had been led before his predecessor. It

is correct that no evidence has been led before the learned Judge who

wrote the Judgment. Closing submissions on behalf of the accused has

been tendered in writing to the learned Judge who wrote the

Judgement. Thereafter some typographical errors have been corrected.

In the aforesaid Supreme Court decision, a portion of the decision of

the case, Central Finance Company PLC V. Chandrasekera (2020)

1 Sri L.R. 161 is cited as follows:

It should be born in mind that in the above case, no evidence was led

before the judge who dismiss the action; all the evidence was led before

his predecessor. It is in that context Jayawardena, J. stated that where

a succeeding judge is called upon to deliver the judgment in a case where

no evidence had been led before him, it is obligatory on the succeeding

judge to have the case called in open Court and notify the parties that he

is required to deliver the judgment since his predecessor is unavailable

and decide which of the three lines of action referred to in the principle

part of Section 48 should be followed, i.e. (a) to act on the evidence

already recorded by his predecessor, or (b) partly recorded by his

predecessor and partly recorded by him or, (c) if he thinks fit, to re-

summon the witness and commence the proceedings afresh. (Emphasis

added)

Page 9 of 12

In the above case also, no evidence has been led before the Judge who

wrote the Judgment and dismissed the action. According to the said

Supreme Court decision, one of the options available to the succeeding

Judge is to act on the evidence already recorded by his predecessor.

Therefore, even if no evidence has been led before the Judge who writes

the Judgment, the succeeding Judge can act on the evidence already

recorded by his predecessor. What the Supreme Court emphasized in

the said Judgment is that it is obligatory on the succeeding Judge to

have the case called in the open Court and notify the parties that he is

required to deliver the Judgment. In the aforesaid case of Central

Finance Company PLC V. Chandrasekera, the learned Judge who heard

the evidence in the Commercial High Court was elevated to the Court

of Appeal. However, even if the Judge who heard the evidence is in a

High Court, the same principles apply and the succeeding Judge can

write the Judgment acting upon the evidence already recorded by his

predecessor after notifying and informing the parties of the case.

In the case at hand, it is apparent from the aforesaid proceedings dated

22.04.2021 that even before the learned High Court Judge, Hon.

Navaratne Marasinghe inquired whether the accused-appellant is

willing to adopt the evidence and proceed before him, the learned

Counsel for the accused, on his own, requested to adopt the evidence

so far led and to proceed. Then only, the learned High Court Judge

decided to proceed with the case, as the accused-appellant agreed to

adopt the evidence and proceed. Therefore, the procedure specified in

the aforesaid Supreme Court case has been perfectly complied with by

the learned High Court Judge who wrote the Judgment. Therefore, I

hold that the Judgment of this case is not contrary to Section 283(1) of

the CCPA and the learned Judge has written the Judgment in

accordance with the law. Therefore, I regret that I am unable to agree

with the legal issue raised by the learned Counsel for the appellant.

Page 10 of 12

The next main issue raised by the learned Counsel for the appellant

was that the act of grave sexual abuse described in the charge has not

been established by the evidence of PW-1. What the learned Counsel

pointed out was that according to the charge, the accused-appellant

inserted his tongue to the female genitalia of the victim but according

to the evidence of the victim, PW-1, the accused-appellant had kissed

her genital area using his mouth.

The learned SSC for the respondent contended in reply that the victim

was seven years old at the time of the offence and when giving the

history to the doctor who examined her, she had told that the accused

inserted his tongue to her genitalia, however, when she gave evidence

at the age of fifteen, she had omitted to state that the tongue had been

inserted to her genitalia but clearly stated that the accused kissed her

genitalia using his mouth. The learned SSC contended further that

there was no discrepancy between her evidence in Court and the history

given to the doctor and this slight omission could be occurred when

giving evidence after seven years of the incident.

I agree with the contention of the learned SSC because after seven years

of the incident, this kind of omission could have occurred. It is normal

that she did not want to repeatedly describe this unpleasant incident

in detail. Although, it is not stated in her evidence that she wanted to

forget this incident, obviously, any person with common sense could

understand that any girl who faces this kind of sexual abuse tries to

forget that unpleasant incident as soon as possible.

However, it should be considered whether the ingredients of the charge

have been proved on the said evidence of PW-1. Interpretation of the

offence of grave sexual abuse in terms of Section 365B(1) is that grave

sexual abuse is committed by any person who, for sexual gratification,

does any act by the use of his genitals or any other part of the human

body or any instrument or any orifice or part of the body of any other

Page 11 of 12

person, being an act which does not amount to rape under Section 363,

in circumstances falling under any of the following descriptions, that is

to say

In the instant action, according to the evidence of PW-1, part of the

accuseds body, that is his mouth was used on the genitalia of the victim

when kissing that area. It is apparent from the evidence that the

accused-appellant performed that act for his sexual gratification.

Therefore, when kissing the genitalia of the victim using the accuseds

mouth, whether he inserted his tongue or not, the ingredients of the

charge of grave sexual abuse are proved.

According to Section 166 of the CCPA, an error or omission of the charge

in stating the particulars of the offence shall not be regarded as

material, unless the accused was misled by such error or omission.

When considering the evidence of PW-1 as to the way that the accused

committed the offence, it is obvious that the accused is not misled by

the description of the offence in the charge. Therefore, the said

discrepancy pointed out by the learned Counsel for the appellant has

no impact in proving the charge against the accused-appellant.

The other matters pointed out by the defence have been considered by

the learned High Court Judge and it is my view that the learned Judge

has come to the conclusion after correct analysis of the evidence of the

case. The findings of the learned Judge are supported by the evidence

presented in the case. The learned Counsel for the appellant did not

canvas the sentence imposed on the accused-appellant. In the

circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the Judgment and the

sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the conviction dated 30.11.2021 and the sentence imposed

on the accused-appellant are affirmed.
