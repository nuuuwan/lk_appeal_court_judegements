For legal purposes, the expectation cannot be the same as anticipation. It is different from a wish, desire or a hope nor can it amount to a claim or demand on the ground of a right. However, earnest and sincere a wish, a desire or a hope may be and however confidently one may look to them to be fulfilled, they by themselves cannot amount to a legitimate expectation and a mere disappointment does not attract legal consequences. A pious hope even leading to a moral obligation cannot amount to a legitimate expectation. The legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure followed in regular and natural sequence. Again, it is distinguishable from a genuine expectation. Such expectation should be justifiable, legitimate and protectable. Every such legitimate expectation does not by itself fructify into a right and, therefore, it does not amount to a right in a conventional sense.",

Another argument raised on behalf of the Respondent was that the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate his claim that the order X3, sought to be quashed, is ultra vires. Citing section 8 of the Ordinance, as amended in 2019, the Petition claims that only two members have participated in the order, and therefore it is ultra vires the said section.

Matters before this Court will have to be dealt with not by all the justices sitting together, but as mandated by the said Article 146. This Court has no way to ascertain the total complement of members of the Kurnegala branch board. The Application seeking the Writ ought to have provided the material necessary to ascertain and determine the matters alleged as to the Order X3 being ultra vires. But there is utter, and dismal, failure in this regard. At page 3 of order X3, in the middle of the 4th line of the second paragraph, and at the very end of the 5th line thereof, the Sinhala words 'theeranaya karamu' have been used. Similarly, the last line in the last page (page 4) also has the same two Sinhala words. These demonstrate that more than one member has participated in the Order X3. On Petitioner's own showing, the very next document annexed, namely X4, also shows that two members have participated in pronouncing the order. Two is the minimum possible according to the Regulations of 1942. The Petitioner has failed to supply the material to demonstrate the allegation of ultra vires. Therefore, the Application for writ has to be failed. Conclusion in X3 is based on findings of primary facts. Even in a civil appeal findings on primary facts should not be lightly be disturbed, unless those findings are perverse. Order X3 has, as amply discernible from its four pages, been arrived at based on very good, valid and plausible reasons. Thus, the findings concerned are in no way perverse. The Petition does not claim, or at least offer any hint, as those findings being perverse. Thus, there is no plausible grounds on which to disturb or upset them.",
