Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Gampaha for committing the offence of grave sexual

abuse on a minor by having intercrural sex with her, for sexual gratification on

or about 18-05-2007 at a place called Hanepola, within the jurisdiction of the

High Court of Gampaha, and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms

of section 365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code as amended by Penal Code Amendment

Act No. 22 of 1995, 29 of 1998 and 16 of 2006.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha of the judgment dated 24-

01-2020 found the appellant guilty as charged and he was sentenced for a period

Page 3 of 13

of 14 years rigorous imprisonment and was also ordered to pay a fine of Rs.

10,000/-. In default of paying the fine, he was sentenced for a period of 8 months

simple imprisonment.

In addition to the above, the appellant was ordered to pay Rs. 200,000/- as

compensation to PW-01, who was the victim of this incident. In default of paying

the compensation, it was ordered that the said amount shall be recovered as a

fine, and in default, he should serve a rigorous imprisonment period of 2 years.

It was also ordered that the default sentences in relation to the fine and

compensation should be served consecutive to each other.

Being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred this

appeal.

Facts in Brief

The victim of this incident (PW-01) was a 12-year-old minor girl during the time

relevant to this incident, and when she commenced her evidence before the High

Court on 10-08-2016, more than 9 years after the incident, she was a 22-year-

old married woman. Although she has attended school up to grade 9, she is a

person who cannot read or write, but who can only place her signature.

Her mother has passed away when she was a child, and she has been living with

her father and the grandmother at Hanepola since 2006. She had two other elder

brothers who were also living with them. At one point, she had been admitted to

a childrens home before this incident came to light. After the incident relating

to this action, she was institutionalized again and had returned home after

reaching 18 years of age.

According to her version of events, this incident has occurred at her home.

During this period, her father was invalid due to a fall from a tree. The appellant

was a person well known to her, who had been a frequent visitor to her home

who used to have liquor with her father.

Page 4 of 13

She has stated that she gave a statement to the police after about two weeks

from the incident, and on that day, when the appellant came to her house, she

was alone as her father had gone to a nearby boutique. The appellant has come

to her house and after coming to know that her father was not at home, has

taken the PW-01 to a room of the house. Thereafter, he had removed her clothes

and has had intercrural sex with her.

In describing what happened (at page 82 of the appeal brief), she has explained

the incident in the following manner,

: ?

: .

However, at a later stage of her evidence, she has stated that the appellant

inserted his penis into her vagina. After engaging in the act, the appellant has

left the house telling her not to divulge the incident to anyone.

However, she has informed her grandmother of the incident faced by her on the

following day, but no one has taken any steps in that regard. When the incident

was informed to her father, he had scolded stating that not to go to the police

station. She has further stated that even before this incident, the appellant took

her to the forest on one day, and on that occasion too, he did the same thing to

her as described earlier.

Although the victim or her family members had not complained to the police

about these abuses, the police appear to have received an information about

these incidents, which has resulted in the police coming to her house and

recording a statement and initiating investigations which led to the indictment

against the appellant.

Page 5 of 13

When the victim was cross-examined, she has stated that the appellant inserted

his penis into her vagina and it happened for about half an hour, and there was

blood after the incident, which the appellant wiped off using his sarong.

The learned Counsel for the appellant has brought to the notice of the Court that

she has neither stated that there was blood on her, or the incident occurred for

about half an hour in her statement to the police.

It appeared from her evidence that the victim child had been admitted to a

childrens home previous to this incident and had returned home after some

time. The incident relevant to this matter has occurred thereafter, and she has

been institutionalized again until she reached the age of 18.

According to the evidence of PW-04 who was one of the police officers who

investigated this incident, the investigations have commenced as a result of a

119-call received by police informing about the relevant sexual abuse incident.

After being informed by the police to come for an investigation, her grandmother

and the child have gone to the police station where PW-04 had recorded their

statements on 23-05-2007. It is she who has produced the victim child before

the doctor.

PW-06 was the doctor who examined the victim child and prepared the Medico-

Legal Report marked P-02. The examination has been done on 24-05-2007 at

the Gampaha hospital. Giving the history of the incident, the child had stated

that Mahathun Uncle came in the night and assaulted her father and he has

previously come about three times and used to remove her clothes and place his

penis on her legs and used to do something.

The doctor has observed her having a fimbriated hymen, but has not observed

any injuries or any other marks in her vaginal area. However, he has opined that

he cannot exclude intercrural sex, because such sex can happen without leaving

any marks. He has also expressed the opinion that although he could not observe

any injuries on the vagina of the child, since she was having a fimbriated hymen,

even penile penetration is possible without causing any tears or any other marks

Page 6 of 13

to the vagina. Several other police officers who assisted the investigations into

the matter has given evidence. After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the

learned trial Judge has decided to call for a defence from the appellant.

Making a statement from the dock, he has stated that he is working in brick kiln

industry and when he came home around 5.00 p.m., he saw Wasantha Rohana

scolding his mother, which resulted him assaulting the said Rohana using a

club. He has claimed that he went back to work after the incident and around

10.00 p.m. the police came and arrested him, informing him that he is wanted

as a suspect of a quarrel. He has claimed that he only came to know

subsequently that he was arrested as a suspect in a rape case and was unaware

any such incident.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The learned High Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence of

PW-01 properly, and thereby had failed to give the benefit of the doubt

to the accused appellant.

2. The prosecution has failed to prove the date of offence and had led

conflicting evidence with regard to the date of offence.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the

prosecution has failed to establish the date of offence as mentioned in the

indictment and the evidence of the victim child in that regard was conflicting. He

also submitted that even the alleged incident which has been described in the

indictment as having intercrural sex with the victim has not been established

beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant. It was his contention that the

victim child has spoken about a penile penetration at one time and her evidence

had been conflicting in that regard as well.

Page 7 of 13

He was of the view that there was a reasonable doubt as to the incidents spoken

of by the victim child, and since there is no other evidence to corroborate the

incidents, the doubt that arises should be held in favour of the appellant. He

also pointed out that the victim child was also not certain as to whether this

incident occurred during the daytime or the night.

He lamented that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

omissions brought to the notice of the Court in favour of the appellant and has

considered what should have been held in favour of the appellant as a

justification for the failures in the victims evidence in the second paragraph of

page 4 (page 150 of the appeal brief) of the judgment.

He was of the view that several other instances relating to the incident that

should have been held in favour of the appellant has been justified without a

sufficient basis in order to find the appellant guilty.

It was the submission of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) on

behalf of the respondent that the evidence of the victim child needs to be

considered in its totality, and the prosecution has proved the case beyond

reasonable doubt against the appellant. The learned SDSG pointed out the age

and the social background of the victim child and her evidence as to the date of

the offence to argue that the prosecution has proved the date of the offence to

the satisfaction of the Court.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

I will now proceed to consider the 2nd ground of appeal where it has been

contended that the prosecution has failed to prove the date of offence, as I find

that it is a matter that should be considered before considering the 1st ground of

appeal urged.

In the indictment, the prosecution has stated the date of the offence as on or

about 18-05-2007.

Page 8 of 13

Section 165(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979, which

provides guidance on particulars as to time, place and the person that should

be mentioned in a charge reads as follows;

165(1). The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and

place of the alleged offence and as to the person (if any) against whom

and as to the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed as

are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the manner

with which he is charged and to show that the offence is not

prescribed.

Section 166 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act which refers to the effects of

any errors mentioned in a charge reads thus;

166. In error in stating either the offence or the particulars required

to be stated in the charge and any omission to state the offence or

those particulars shall not be regarded at any stage of the case as

material unless the accused was misled by such error or omission.

The above mentioned relevant statutory provisions clearly stipulate the purpose

of mentioning the date of an offence and other particulars is to give sufficient

notice to any accused person as to the charge against him and for the purposes

of showing the offence has not been prescribed. Any omission or error in giving

the required particulars in a charge becomes material only if such error or

omission has caused the accused to be misled as to the charge or charges

preferred against him.

When it comes to the facts and the circumstances of the appeal under

consideration, there is nothing to indicate the appellant was misled in any

manner as to the charge against him.

The question whether the prosecution has failed to prove the date of the offence

to the satisfaction of the Court has to be taken into consideration not by taking

Page 9 of 13

into account the evidence of the victim child, but by considering the evidence led

in the trial in its totality.

The evidence clearly shows that the victim child was virtually living as an orphan

because her mother has passed away when she was young and her father has

become an invalid person due to a fall from a tree and a person which appears

to be addicted to liquor. The only person who has looked after her appears to be

her grandmother. Although the child has attended school, when she gave

evidence at the age of 22, it has been found that she was a person who could not

read or write, which shows that the level of care given towards her by her father

and the elders of the family, who should have cared for her.

According to the evidence of the PW-04, who was one of the police officers who

conducted investigations into the matter, it was after receiving a 119 message

that a child is being repeatedly raped at a house, the police have commenced

their investigations. After commencing the investigations, they have gone to the

house of the victim child on 20-05-2007, and had recorded the statement of the

grandmother of the child on 23-05-2007.

In her evidence, PW-01 has stated that she made a statement to the police two

weeks after the incident. However, even at that stage, it has been clear that the

victim was not certain about the date of the offence. I find that it was under these

circumstances the date of offence has been stated as on or about 18-05-2007,

in order to give sufficient notice to the appellant as to the allegations against

him.

There is nothing to indicate that the appellant has been misled or prejudiced by

the victim childs inability to give an exact time or date of the incident, or a reason

to conclude that it has created a reasonable doubt as to the evidence of the victim

child.

Page 10 of 13

At this juncture, I would like to draw my attention to the case of R. Vs. Dossi 12

Cr. App. R., 158 where this aspect was sufficiently discussed.

It was held,

That a date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless

it is an essential part of the alleged offence; the defendant maybe

convicted although the Jury find that the offence was committed on a

date other than that specified in the indictment. Amendment of the

indictment is unnecessary, although it will be a good practice to do so

(provided there is no prejudice) where it is clear on the evidence that

if the offence as committed at all, it was committed on the day other

than that specified.

In the case of D.R.M Pandithacoralage Vs. V.K Selvenayagam 56 NLR 143, it

was held that a mistaken date in an indictment is not a material error unless

the date is the essence of the offence or the accused is prejudiced.

It needs to be noted that the victim child was an 12 year-old when these incidents

occurred and has given evidence before the High Court, 09 years afterwards. The

ability of a person to remember things that occurred a decade ago or the day or

dates upon which such incidents occurred depends on the mental capacity of

such a person and several other factors.

In the case of D. Tikiri Banda Vs. The Attorney General, Bar Association Law

Reports 2010 (B.L.R. 92) it was held,

1. Mostly the victims of sexual harassment prefer not to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon as

possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders would not be allowed to

capitalize or to take mean advantage of these natural, inherent weaknesses

of small children.

Page 11 of 13

2. If the evidence of the victim could be relied upon as trustworthy, firm etc.,

there is no impediment on the part of the occur in acting solely on the

evidence of the victim and it is only when the evidence of the victim suffers

from some infirmity or where the Courts believe that it would not be prudent

to base conviction solely on that evidence the Court should look for

corroboration.

In the case of Attorney General Vs. Dardadagamage Chandraratna

Jayawardene alias Shantha, CA 85/2013 decided on 25-05-2018,

Thureirajah, J. observed,

Time and again the Courts have discussed the acceptance of the evidence

of children of tender ages. Our judges are not there to test the memory of the

witnesses. They are expected to find the actual fact and the truth. Witnesses

are human beings. They are not memory machines nor robots to repeat the

incident as it was. Further, the natural behaviour of human beings is to

forget incidents, especially sad memories. No one wants to re-visit painful

moments and keep detailed memories with them.

However, this does not mean that every mistake or contradiction can be brushed

aside in favour of a victim of a sexual crime. However, I am of the view that

discrepancies, omissions or whatever the drawbacks of a prosecutions case have

to be material discrepancies or omissions that creates a reasonable doubt as to

the credibility of a witness. I do not find any basis to conclude that the evidence

of the victim child and other supporting evidence, when taken as a whole, has

created any doubt in relation to the narration of events by the victim child.

Hence, I find no basis for the 2nd ground of appeal.

The 1st ground of appeal urged by the learned Counsel was that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence in the proper perspective and

has failed to give the benefit of doubt in matters that favoured the appellant to

him.

Page 12 of 13

It was contended that the evidence of the victim where she has stated at one

point that the appellant had intercrural sex with her and at another point he

inserted his penis into her vagina should have been considered in favour of the

appellant on the basis that the victim was not consistent in her evidence, but

the learned High Court Judge has considered it otherwise, in favour of the

victims version of events.

I do not find any basis to consider the above submission as a weakness in the

analysis of evidence by the learned High Court Judge. The judgment clearly

provides that the learned High Court Judge has correctly considered the evidence

in its totality, and has considered all the relevant factors to come to a finding

that the evidence of the victim was cogent enough for him to believe as truthful,

for which I find no reason to disagree. It is amply clear from the judgment that

the learned High Court Judge has well considered all the discrepancies alleged

in relation to the evidence placed before the Court, and has come to his

determinations with sound reasoning.

The defence taken up by the appellant has not created an iota of doubt as to the

evidence of the victim.

For the completeness of this judgment, I would like to quote the Indian Supreme

Court judgment in State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. M.K Anthoney (1984) S.C.J

236-1985 Cri. L.J. 493 at 498.

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring

of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the

Court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the

deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of

the evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor

discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-

Page 13 of 13

technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here and there

from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed

by the investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not

ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the Court before

whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion

about the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate Court

had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of

evidence by the trial Court and unless there are reasons weightily and

formidable it would not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of

minor variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details. Even honest

and truthful witness may differ in some details unrelated to the main

incident because power of observation, retention and reproduction differ

with individuals.

The Appeal is dismissed, as I find no merit in the grounds of appeal urged.

The conviction and the sentence dated 24-01-2020 affirmed.

However, since the appellant had been in incarceration from his date of

conviction, it is directed that his conviction shall be deemed to have commenced

from the date of the conviction, namely from 24-01-2020.
