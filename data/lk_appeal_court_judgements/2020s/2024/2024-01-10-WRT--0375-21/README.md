The 3rd respondent was the original owner of the subject land of this

application. The petitioners purchased the said land from the 3rd respondent

by the Deed of Transfer No. 10469 dated 23.03.2004. The 3rd respondent

agreed with the petitioners to have the land re-transferred in the event the 3rd

respondent pays back the money obtained from the petitioners with the

interest. The petitioners claimed that they have become absolute owners of

the subject land as the 3rd respondent has failed to act upon the agreement.

Then, the land was acquired by the State as per the Gazette Extraordinary

No. 1981/77 dated 25.08.2016 (P-3). The petitioners stated that they were

not aware that the land had been acquired by the State, the petitioners were

cheated by the 3rd respondent to sign a deed re-transferring the property to

Page 3 of 10

him, but in fact, the petitioners had no title to the land to confer on the 3rd

respondent by a Deed of Transfer because the land had been acquired by the

State. The 3rd respondents position was that there was no transfer of

beneficial interest of the property but only a nominal transfer had taken place.

Anyhow, the notice under Section 7 of the Land Acquisition Act was published

in respect of lots 641,642 and 643 of the preliminary plan No. 198 prepared

by the Surveyor General. Inquiry under Section 9 of the Act was held. The

compensation for the acquisition of land was first awarded to the petitioners

by the awards P-6(a), P-7(a) and P-8(a). Subsequently, on or about

02.12.2020, the 1st respondent made minutes on P-6(a), P-7(a) and P-8(a)

cancelling those awards. The petitioners stated that thereafter they received

fresh notices dated 02.09.2020 issued by the 1st respondent under Section

10 (1) (a) of the Land Acquisition Act stating that the 3rd respondent was

determined as the owner of the said land.

The petitioners by this application seek to quash awards P-14, P-15 and

P-16. The petitioners also seek Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the

1st respondent to cancel awards contained in P-6(a), P-7(a) and P-8(a). In

addition, the petitioners seek a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the

1st respondent not to refer the dispute to the District Court and a Writ of

Mandamus directing the 1st respondent to refer the dispute to District Court

for determination under Section 10 (2) of the Land Acquisition Act.

At the hearing, the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the learned Deputy

Solicitor General for the 1st respondent and the learned Counsel for the 3rd

respondent made oral submissions. Subsequently, all three parties tendered

written submissions, in addition to the oral submissions that they have made.

The contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioners was that the 3rd

respondent obtained the petitioners signatures for a deed by

Page 4 of 10

misrepresentation and fraud. The learned Counsel contended that the

petitioners were cheated by the 3rd respondent to sign a deed transferring the

property to him and the petitioners were not aware that the land had been

acquired by the State. Further, the learned Counsel contended that the 3rd

respondent had submitted a document prepared using a blank sheet signed

by the petitioners expressing the petitioners consent for payment of

compensation to the 3rd respondent in respect of the said land.

The main allegation of the learned Counsel for the petitioners was that after

revoking awards made in favour of the petitioners, although a fresh inquiry

was called for, the petitioners were not given a hearing. The learned Counsel

for the petitioners contended further, although, it was mentioned in P-14,

P-15 and P-16 that if the petitioners wish to have the dispute referred to the

District Court, they should apply within fourteen days, when the petitioners

made an application to refer the matter to the District Court, the 1st

respondent refused to refer the dispute to the District Court. The contention

of the learned Counsel was that the 1st respondent has no power to do so.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the 1st respondent raised

following objections and urged to dismiss the application.

i. The petitioners have willfully suppressed and/or misrepresented

material facts, have failed to come before Court with clean hands

and are in breach of the duty of disclosure, thus, lack Uberima Fides.

ii. The petitioners have failed to disclose a public duty owed to them by

the respondents.

iii. The petitioners are guilty of laches and there is an inordinate delay

in filing this application.

In addition to the aforesaid objections, the learned DSG pointed out that the

major facts pertaining to the application are in dispute and thus the

petitioners cannot invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court. With regard to

Page 5 of 10

the delay, the learned DSG pointed out that the awards P-6(a), P-7(a) and

P-8(a) were issued on 2nd December 2020, awards P-14, P-15 and P-16 were

issued on 21st August 2020 but the petitioners came before this Court on 5th

August 2021 which is over a year later. As pointed out by the learned DSG

there is no averment in the petition to explain the delay. Unexplained delay

is a reason to dismiss this application.

The learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent agreed with the submissions made

by the learned Deputy Solicitor General. The learned Counsel for the 3rd

respondent submitted further, if compensation had been awarded to a wrong

person, the aggrieved party has a remedy in terms of Section 57(1) of the Land

Acquisition Act. When there is an alternative remedy, the learned Counsel

contended that the petitioners are not entitled to seek the discretionary

remedy by way of a writ.

The petitioners have filed this application for the purpose of obtaining

compensation for the acquisition of subject land. The petitioners complaint

is that awarding compensation to the third respondent is incorrect and that

they should be compensated.

Initially, in terms of Section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act, the awards P-6(a),

P-7(a) and P-8(a) were made in favour of the petitioners. However, as it was

found that the said decisions under Section 10(1)(a) and Section 17 of the

Land Acquisition Act had been made erroneously, said awards were revoked

and a fresh inquiry was called. Then, the 1st respondent decided in terms of

Section 10(1)(a) of the Land Acquisition Act that the 3rd respondent was the

owner of the aforesaid three allotments of land.

Section 10 of the Act reads as follows:

(1) At the conclusion of an inquiry held under section 9, the acquiring officer

holding the inquiry shall either-

Page 6 of 10

(a) make a decision on every claim made by any person to any

right, title or interest to, in or over the land which is to be acquired

or over which a servitude is to be acquired and on every such

dispute as may have arisen between any claimants as to any such

right, title or interest, and give notice of his decision to the claimant

or to each of the parties to the dispute, or

(b) refer the claim or dispute for determination as hereinafter

provided.

(2) A claimant whose claim is wholly or partly disallowed, or a party to a

dispute which is determined, by the decision of an acquiring officer under

subsection (1) may, within fourteen days of the service on him of notice of the

decision, make application to that acquiring officer for the reference of the claim

or dispute, as the case may be, for determination as hereinafter provided; and

that acquiring officer shall make a reference accordingly.

(3) Every reference under the preceding provisions of this section shall be made

to the District Court or the Primary Court having jurisdiction over the place

where the land which is to be acquired or over which a servitude is to be

acquired is situated, according as the total amount of the claims for

compensation for the acquisition of the land or servitude exceeds or does not

exceed one thousand five hundred rupees.

(4) In every case in which a reference is made to the District Court or to the

Primary Court as hereinbefore provided, the acquiring officer shall defer the

making of his award under section 17 in respect of the land or servitude to

which such reference relates until a determination on such reference is made

by that court or, in the event of an appeal under section 14, by the Court of

Appeal.

Page 7 of 10

(5) Where an acquiring officer makes a decision on any claim or dispute under

subsection (1), and the claim or dispute is not referred for determination as

provided in subsection (3), the decision shall be final.

The main allegation made by the learned Counsel for the petitioners was that

the 1st respondent did not refer the dispute to the District Court although the

petitioners requested to refer the dispute to the District Court. It is correct

that in P-14, P-15 and P-16, it is mentioned that if the matter needs to be

referred to the District Court, an application has to be submitted to the 1st

respondent within fourteen days.

Referring a dispute to the District Court is done in terms of Section 10(1)(b)

when there is a dispute between claimants. In this matter, the only claimant

for the subject land according to the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1981/77 was

the 3rd respondent. When there was only one claimant, there was no dispute

to be referred to the District Court. The claimants should have made their

claims before the Divisional Secretary. If there is a dispute regarding those

claimants only, the matter is referred to the District Court. What has

happened here is only the 3rd respondent was the claimant before the

Divisional Secretary. After issuing the awards P-14, P-15 and P-16, the

petitioners came forward and requested to refer the matter to the District

Court. Section 10(1) of the Act does not permit to refer the matter to the

District Court in such instances. Therefore, the 1st respondent correctly

refused to refer the matter to the District Court.

Apart from that, the petitioners have made a statement before the Divisional

Secretary of Thumpane on 19.03.2018 specifically expressing their consent

to pay the 3rd respondent the entire compensation. The relevant portion of the

statement of the petitioners is as follows:

Page 8 of 10

.

At the hearing of this application, the learned Counsel for the petitioners

contended that the petitioners signatures have been obtained to the said

statement fraudulently. He stated that petitioners signatures were obtained

to a blank paper. This statement is contained in the inquiry held in terms of

Section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act. The said document has been marked

as 1-R8F. Recording the said statement was an official act performed in the

Divisional Secretariat of Thumpane. The officer who recorded the statement

has signed at the end of the statement. The Divisional Secretary stated at the

beginning of making the statement that the statement is made in front of her.

After making the statement, the Divisional Secretary has signed stating that

it was made before her. The allegation made by the learned Counsel for the

petitioners that the Divisional Secretary has fraudulently obtained

petitioners signatures for a statement that they have not made is a very

serious allegation. Apart from making that allegation in this Court, it is

strange to see that the Petitioners have not made a complain to anywhere else

that the Divisional Secretary has fraudulently obtained their signatures for a

blank sheet and recorded a false statement that they did not make.

In perusing the document 1-R8F, it is apparent that in the page where the

petitioners statement is recorded, part of the 3rd respondents statement also

appears at the top of the page. Petitioners statement appears in the middle

of the page. So, this is a continuation of recording statements of the parties.

In addition, the petitioners have not just placed their signatures at the end of

the statement but they placed their signatures in front of their names. Hence,

if the petitioners placed their signatures to a blank sheet, their signatures

cannot exactly come to the end of their statement and exactly in front of their

names. It cannot happen under any circumstances. Hence, it is apparent that

Page 9 of 10

the allegation made by the learned Counsel for the petitioners against the

Divisional Secretary is baseless. Anyhow, the petitioners admit that their

signatures appear in that document. The Divisional Secretary certified that

the petitioners made that statement before her and placed their signatures.

This is an official act performed by the Divisional Secretary under the

provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. According to Section 114 illustration

(d) of the Evidence ordinance, the Court may presume that judicial and official

acts have been regularly performed. In the case of Jayaweera V. Assistant

Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another (1996) 2

Sri L.R. 70, it was observed that there is a presumption that official and legal

acts are regularly and correctly performed. Therefore, the petitioners cannot

maintain this application on that allegation as it is not proved in a Court with

competent jurisdiction or anywhere else that the said statement have been

recorded fraudulently by the Assistant Divisional Secretary who conducted

the inquiry under Section 9 of the Land Acquisition Act.

The statement made by the petitioners during Section 9 inquiry appears in

the document marked 1-R8F. According to the statement of the petitioners

contained in 1-R8F, the petitioners categorically requested to pay the

compensation to the 3rd respondent. This is a proof not only that the

petitioners did not claim compensation but also, they requested to pay the

same to the 3rd respondent. Hence, there was only one claimant, and there

was no dispute among claimants and there was no necessity to refer the

matter to the District Court. Accordingly, the 1st respondent correctly made

the awards P-14, P-15 and P-16 to the 3rd respondents and refused the matter

to be referred to the District Court. In the circumstances, I hold that the

petitioners are not entitled to seek the reliefs prayed for in the petition.
