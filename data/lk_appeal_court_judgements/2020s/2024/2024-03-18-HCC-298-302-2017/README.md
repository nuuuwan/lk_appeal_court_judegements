Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an action where seven accused were indicted initially before the High

Court of Kurunegala. Subsequently, the case has been transferred to the High

Court of Kuliyapitiya after the said High Court was established.

Pending the trial, on the basis that the 4th and the 7th accused had passed away,

the indictment has been amended. The amended indictment against the

remaining accused reads as follows.

1. On 14-08-1996, the accused along with the now deceased Liyana

Aarachchilage Thilakarathne and A. P. Chaminda Wijerathne were

members of an unlawful assembly with the intention of causing injuries

to one Makewita Liyanage Padmasiri, and thereby committed an offence

punishable in terms of section 140 of the Penal Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, being members of the

said unlawful assembly, causing the death of the earlier mentioned

Padmasiri, by assaulting him with the said common object, and thereby

Page 4 of 20

committed an offence punishable in terms of section 296 read with

section 146 of the Penal Code.

3. At the same time and at the same transaction, being members of the

said unlawful assembly and with a common object, caused injuries to

one Chaminda Nalin Kumara, and thereby committed an offence

punishable in terms of section 314 read with section 146 of the Penal

Code.

4. At the same time and at the same transaction, caused the death of the

earlier mentioned Padmasiri, and thereby committed the offence of

murder punishable in terms of section 296 read with section 32 of the

Penal Code.

5. At the same time and at the same transaction, caused injuries to earlier

mentioned Nalin Kumara, and thereby committed an offence

punishable in terms of section 314 read with section 32 of the Penal

Code.

When the charges were read over to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 6th accused who

were the available accused at that time, all of them have pleaded not guilty to

the charges and had opted to have a non-jury trial.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya, pronouncing his

Judgement on 08-11-2017 had found the accused guilty to the 1st and the 2nd

counts preferred against them, and had acquitted them from the 3rd count. On

the basis that the 4th and the 5th count should be considered as alternate counts,

the learned High Court Judge has decided not to pronounce an order in relation

to the said counts.

The said accused had been sentenced to 6 months each rigorous imprisonment

on count 1 and had been sentenced to death on count 2.

It is against the said Judgement and the sentence the accused-appellants have

preferred this appeal. While the appeal is pending, the 3rd accused-appellant

namely Arampath Piyanlage Thilakarathne also has passed away while in prison

Page 5 of 20

custody. Therefore, the appeal before this Court now only relates to the 1st

accused-appellant namely Kachchikaduge Gamini Tissa, the 2nd accused-

appellant namely Hitithami Appuhamilage Gamini Kinsley Joseph, the 5th

accused-appellant namely Athukoralalage Chandrapala and the 6th accused-

appellant namely Handun Pathirannahalage Ranjith Pathirathna (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 1st accused, 2nd accused, 5th accused, and 6th

accused for easy reference.)

It needs to be mentioned that although in the judgement, the learned High Court

Judge has mentioned the already deceased 4th accused Liyana Aarachchilage

Thilakaratne as one of the accused tried before the Court, it should stand

corrected as the 3rd accused namely Arampath Piyanlage Thilakaratne, according

to the indictment. However, I am of the view that since both these persons are

now deceased, it has not caused any prejudice towards the other accused-

appellants as a result of the above misdirection in the Judgement.

Before I would proceed to consider the grounds of appeal proper, I would now

briefly summarize the evidence in the following manner.

Facts in Brief

The incident has occurred in the afternoon of 15-08-1996. On the said day after

work, the deceased along with several other friends including some of the

witnesses had gone to have a bath in a well near his house.

PW-03 Priyantha Senadeera was one of the friends who accompanied the

deceased. Around 2.30 - 3.00 in the afternoon, a known group of around 20-30

people including Chuti, Gamini, Pathiratne, Chaminda and several others have

come in an agitated state towards them. The deceased was bathing at that time,

and when he saw the crowd, he has told the witness and his other friends,

namely Samantha and Ranjith, to run. The witness did not know the reason for

the crowd to attack them. The persons who ran after the deceased had got hold

of him, and Gamini, the second accused has started assaulting him using a club.

The others have also joined him, and among them, the witness has seen Sujee,

Page 6 of 20

Chuti, Pathiratne and Chaminda. The witness has identified the person called

Chuti as the first accused and the person called Sujee as the 4th accused. He

has stated that the 5th accused was also present, but he was unable to remember

his name, while the 6th accused, namely Pathiratne was also a participant of the

assault. According to him, the others also has attacked the deceased using clubs.

There appears to be a confusion as to whether the person who was dead at that

time when the indictment was amended was actually Liyana Arachchilage

Thilakarathne as mentioned in the amended indictment, or it was in fact, the 3rd

accused, namely Arampath Piyanlage Thilakarathne.

According to the witness, the incident has taken place for about 20-30 minutes,

and Samantha, who was one of the friends with them also sustained injuries as

a result of this incident. The witness has observed the incident from few meters

away, while hiding in a thicket.

It is noteworthy to mention that the witness has given evidence before the trial

Court on 21-01-2015, nearly 18 years after the incident, and while being in

prison for over 14 years for committing another offence. It appears from his

evidence that as a result, he has forgotten most of the details of the incident,

which has resulted in several contradictions and omissions in his evidence.

He has spoken about several persons who had assaulted the deceased while

carrying swords with them as well.

PW-01 is the sister of the deceased referred to by PW-03 as Shantha, whose real

name is Makewita Liyanage Padmasiri. According to her evidence, she has not

seen the actual incident, but has gone to the place where her brother had been

fallen after hearing that he has been attacked and injured.

When she reached there, the 1st, 6th, 4th and 5th accused, who are well known to

her were present. The 1st appellant has told her to get ready to perform final

rights () to her brother.

Page 7 of 20

She has observed injuries all over his body, and after taking him to the hospital,

she has come to know that her brother had passed away. She has testified that

she is unable to remember whether the said persons had any weapons with

them.

The injured person in the incident, namely Athukorala Chaminda Nalin Kumara

has also given evidence at the trial, and has substantiated the version of events

as stated by PW-03.

According to him, when they were running to escape from the crowd coming

towards them, the deceased and he could not run away as they have fallen on

the ground. The persons who came started to assault him and the deceased, and

it was one Thilake who has initially attacked him. He has stated that the 1st

accused is the one who rescued him from being attacked. He has identified the

1st, 5th, and the 6th accused as the persons who were among the group who

assaulted the deceased and him.

The witness has admitted that he too is an accused in another case, but has

denied the suggestion that he was falsely implicating the accused for the offence.

The doctor who examined the injured has marked his Medico-Legal Report (MLR)

as P-03 and has testified that the injured had two contusions. He has also

confirmed that in the history given by the injured, he stated that it was Gamini,

Tikka and Sujee who assaulted him.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who held the postmortem was not present in

the Court to give evidence and the defence has admitted the Postmortem Report,

which has been recorded as an admission in terms of Section 420 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge has

decided to call for a defence from all the available accused including the

appellants, and all of them had made dock statements.

Page 8 of 20

The 1st, 2nd, 4th and the 6th accused appellants had denied their involvement in

the incident and has claimed that due to political rivalry, they were falsely

implicated.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the 1st accused appellant

formulated the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. There is a serious doubt as to the participation of the 1st accused appellant

in view of the inter se and per se contradictions.

2. There is a reasonable doubt as to the participation of five or more people

with a common object of unlawful assembly.

3. The dock statement has not been evaluated separately and had been

rejected in the strength of the prosecution evidence.

The learned Counsel for the 2nd accused appellant formulated the following

grounds of appeal.

1. Evidence of PW-03, namely Priyantha Senadeera is wholly contradictory,

unsafe and unreliable.

2. Evidence of PW-04, namely Chaminda Nalin Kumara is erratic, and no

reliance could be placed on his evidence.

3. Following closely on the heels of ground 01 and 02, the learned trial Judge

woefully failed to assess the credibility and testimonial trustworthiness of

the said witness.

4. Conflict of evidence between PW-03 and PW-04 creates a serious doubt

with regard to the prosecution case, which the learned trial Judge has

totally failed to address his mind.

5. The judgement of the trial Court is in violation of Section 283 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act and defective for the reasons set out below,

namely;

Total failure to assess the testimonial trustworthiness of the

eyewitness.

Page 9 of 20

Total failure to reason out the reliance placed on the

eyewitness.

Failure to apply the relevant law relating to unlawful

assembly.

Failure to address its legal mind to conflict of evidence and

infirmities in the testimony of PW-03 and PW-04.

The learned Counsel for the 5th and 6th accused appellant associated himself

with the ground of appeals urged by the learned Counsel for 1st and 2nd accused

appellants.

In their submissions before this Court, the general contention of the learned

Counsel was that the evidence of the witnesses was contradictory to each other

and are not trustworthy and cogent enough to find the accused appellants guilty

for the charge based on such evidence.

However, the main contention of the learned Counsel was that the judgement

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge was not a judgement in terms of

Section 283 of Code of Criminal Procedure Act, and there was no analysis of the

evidence and conclusions based on such an analysis. Therefore, the purported

judgement should stand vacated, as it cannot be said that it was a judgement

pronounced in accordance with the law.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

The learned Counsel for all the appellants made extensive submissions

challenging the way the judgement has been written to argue that it should be

vacated based on the failure of the learned High Court Judge to pronounce a

correct judgement in accordance with law. Hence, I find it necessary to consider

the said submission in relation to the judgement under appeal.

In his judgement which amounts to 13 pages, the learned High Court Judge has

mentioned the charges and the number of witnesses led at the trial from 1st to

4th page. The learned High Court Judge has summarized the prosecution

Page 10 of 20

evidence and the dock statement from 5th to 10th page and, thereafter, has stated

the following:

When it comes to a judgement, it is needless to say that each Judge has his or

her own way of judgement writing. However, it is my considered view that

whatever the way of writing maybe, for it to be considered as a judgement in

terms of the relevant provisions of the law, the necessary ingredients of a

judgement should be considered and the judgement should reflect that it was

so. The final determinations need to be reached based on considerations given

to the evidence placed before the Court and the relevant law.

Page 12 of 20

The essential ingredients of a judgement in terms of section 283(1), (2) and (3) of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act read as follows;

283. The following provisions shall apply for the judgments of Courts

other than the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal:-

(1) The judgement shall be written by the Judge who heard the

case and shall be dated and signed by him in open Court at the

time of pronouncing it, and in a case where appeal lies shall

contain the point or points for determination, the decision

thereon, and the reasons for the decision.

(2) It shall specify the offence if any of which and the section of

the law under which the accused is convicted and the

punishment to which he is sentenced.

(3) If it be a judgement of acquittal it shall state the offence of

which the accused is acquitted.

Our superior Courts have consistently interpreted the essential requirements of

a judgement providing necessary guidelines for trial Judges to enable them to

enhance their judgement writing skills, which in my view, our trial Judges

should endeavour to follow all the time.

In this regard, Jayasuriya, J. with reference to several other decided cases,

observed the following in the case of Chandrasena and Others Vs. Munaweera

(1998) 3 SLR 94 at 96;

In Ibrahim Vs. Inspector of Police 59 NLR 235, the Supreme Court

emphasized that the mere outline of the prosecution and the defence without

reasons being given for the decision but embellished by such phrases as I

accept the evidence of the prosecution and I disbelieve the defence is by

itself an insufficient discharge of duty cast upon the Judge by section 306(1)

of the Criminal Procedure Code. Vide also the decision in Thusaiya Vs.

Pathihamy 15 CLW 119 by Nihill, J.- According to the presently applicable

section 283(1) of the Code 283(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.

15 of 1979, the Judgement shall contain the point or points for

Page 13 of 20

determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for the decision. The

Supreme Court stressed that the object of the statutory provision is to enable

the Supreme Court to have before it the specific opinion of the Judge in the

lower Court on the question of fact, so that it may enable the Court to

ascertain whether the finding is correct or not. The weight of authority is to

the effect that the failure to observe the imperative provisions of the section

is a fatal irregularity and that even in a simple case that the provisions of

this statute must be complied with.

Considering grounds of appeal similar in nature, Ranjith Silva, J. in C.A.

Appeal No. 62-65/2005 decided on 07-06-2011 made the following

observation emphasizing the importance of a proper judgement.

We have perused the Judgement and the Judgement runs into nine pages

but not a single paragraph contains any evaluation of evidence. The learned

Judge has not said anything about omissions and had just brushed aside

one of the contradictions stating that they are insignificant, but does not

refer to the other two contradictions. This Judgement is only a repetition of

evidence and does not amount to a Judgement in terms of section 283 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The learned Judge appears to have very

conveniently discharged her functions without taking any pains to write a

proper Judgement. It is extremely pathetic to note how much time and how

much money that has been spent on this case over the years and finally it

has to end up in a situation where this Court is compelled to order a retrial.

It is also true that the learned High Court Judge has turned a blind eye with

regard to the dock statement. She has not mentioned the concepts or a single

authority or tried to appreciate or evaluate the dock statement in that light.

In this context although we find that the Judge could have easily supported

the conviction with real evaluation of evidence and contradictions and

omissions, we are unable to justify this although a Court of Appeal will not

lightly interfere with the findings of facts especially with regard to the

credibility as it was held in Fraad Vs. Brown and Company 20 NLR 282,

Page 14 of 20

Piyasena Vs. Alwis (1993) 1 SLR 119 at 122, Wikramasooriya Vs.

Dedolina (1996) 2 NLR 95.

It is well settled law that the duty of a trial Judge is to consider the evidence

placed before the Court by both the prosecution and the defence as a whole, and

come to his findings, rather than compartmentalizing as happened in the

impugned Judgement.

In the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 SLR 167,

the trial Judge stated that, I had considered the defence of the accused and I

hold that it is untenable and false in the light of the evidence led by the

prosecution.

Held:

There is a serious misdirection in law. It is a grave error for the trial Judge

to direct himself that he must examine the tenability and truthfulness of

the evidence of the accused in the light of the evidence led by the

prosecution. To examine the evidence of the defence of the accused in the

light of the prosecution witness is to reverse the presumption of innocence.

Per Rodrigo, J.

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to

consider all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the

prosecution or by the defence in its totality without

compartmentalizing and, ask himself whether as a prudent man, in

the circumstances of the particular case, he believes the accused

guilty or not guilty.- See the Privy Council Judgement in Jayasena

Vs. The Queen 72 NLR 313.

At this juncture, I find it relevant to cite the Indian Supreme Court judgement in

the case of State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Anthony (1984) SCJ 236/ (1985) CRI

L.J. 493 at 498/499, which provides clear guidance as to how to approach the

analyzing of evidence in a case by a trial Judge.

Page 15 of 20

It was held:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring

of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the

Court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the

deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of evidence given by the witness and whether earlier evaluation of the

evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies

on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach

by taking sentences torn out of context here and there from the evidence,

attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating

officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit the

rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the Court before whom the witness

gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about the general

tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate Court which had not

this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by

the trial Court and unless there are reasons weightily and formidable it

would not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of minor variations

or infirmities in the matter of trivial details. Even honest and truthful witness

may differ in some details unrelated to the main incident because power of

observation, retention and reproduction differ with individuals.

With the above guidelines in mind, I will now proceed to consider whether the

submissions made by the learned Counsel on the basis that the judgement

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge cannot be considered a judgement

in terms of Section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act have any

justification.

The first count preferred against the accused had been that they were members

of an unlawful assembly with the common object of causing injuries to the

deceased person. The second count upon which the accused were convicted had

Page 16 of 20

been based on the fact that the accused committed the offence of murder while

being members of that unlawful assembly.

Therefore, for the accused to be convicted of the first and the second count, it

was paramount for the learned High Court Judge to consider whether the offence

of unlawful assembly had been established beyond reasonable doubt, and

whether the accused mentioned in the charge had in fact been members of the

said unlawful assembly.

In terms of Section 138 of the Penal Code, to constitute an unlawful assembly,

there must be five or more persons in that assembly with a common object of

committing one or more of the offences mentioned in the section itself.

The learned High Court Judge has stated in his judgement that there was

evidence before the Court to the effect that a large number of persons came as a

group and 1st to 7th accused mentioned in the charge were members of that

group. It has been stated that the deceased passed away as a result of the assault

by the said group, who had a common object and a pre-arrangement, and there

is no evidence to conclude that there was no unlawful assembly.

It is correct that a group of persons had come and assaulted the deceased.

However, to prove the 1st and the 2nd counts against the accused, it becomes

necessary to show that the accused were among the group who came and

assaulted the deceased.

The only persons who have given evidence as eyewitnesses to the incident had

been PW-03 and PW-04. PW-04 is the person who has sustained injuries in the

incident and the person mentioned in the third count as the injured person.

According to the evidence of PW-03, although he speaks about 20-30 persons

coming towards them and assaulting the deceased, in Court he has only

mentioned the names of four persons, namely Chuti, Gamini, Pathiratne, and

Chaminda. He has identified the 2nd accused as Gamini and the 1st accused as

Chuti, and had stated that the other two are not in the Court, probably referring

to the accused who was deceased at that time. He has also identified the 4th and

Page 17 of 20

5th accused as persons who were present there, and the 6th accused as a person

who assaulted.

The evidence of PW-04 had been to the effect that several persons came to assault

the deceased and the 1st accused came to the place of the incident afterwards,

and it was he who rescued him from being assaulted. According to him, he has

identified one Thilake and Chaminda among the persons who came and

assaulted him.

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge should have analyzed these

pieces of evidence and come to a firm finding based on a proper analysis whether

the evidence establishes an unlawful assembly and the accused were members

of the said unlawful assembly, which I am unable to determine by studying the

judgment.

The learned High Court Judge has viewed the evidence of PW-01, the sister of

the deceased who had subsequently come to the place of the incident, the words

allegedly uttered by the 1st accused to get ready to perform the final rites, as an

indication of the common object.

Although the learned High Court Judge has stated that the evidences was

unchallenged, there is no basis to come to such a conclusion as the evidence

had been challenged by the accused. Under the circumstances, it was the duty

of the learned High Court Judge to analyze the evidence and come to a finding

in that regard, rather than making a statement that the evidence was

unchallenged.

Commenting on the dock statements of the accused, the learned High Court

Judge has come to a finding that when PW-01 was giving evidence, she has not

been questioned about any animosity that existed between the parties. It has

also been determined that apart from PW-01s evidence, the incident has been

proved beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence of other eyewitnesses.

Page 18 of 20

I am of the view that this is a highly unsatisfactory way to come to a

determination of facts. In this case, the only other witness apart from PW-03,

who has spoken about seeing the incident was PW-04, the other injured person.

However, the learned High Court Judge has acquitted the accused from the third

count preferred against them in that regard on the basis that PW-03s evidence

was unsatisfactory. If that was so, there is a duty cast upon the learned High

Court Judge to analyze the evidence and state the reasons for his conclusion

that there are other eyewitnesses who speaks about the incident.

The learned High Court Judge has observed that there are discrepancies as to

the weapons used by the accused, and due to the fact that the evidence has

commenced nearly 20 years after the incident, the witnesses cannot have a

photographic memory, which is true. However, I find it necessary for the learned

High Court Judge to elaborate more on that and to highlight the relevant

discrepancies and justify them, rather than making a general statement in the

judgement.

Having considered the above, I am of the view that the analysis of the evidence

in this matter, as reproduced earlier, was inadequate to conclude that this was

a conviction reached after proper analysis of the evidence. Therefore, I find merit

in the ground of appeal urged by the learned Counsel on the basis that the

judgement was not in accordance with the requirements of Section 283 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

Accordingly, I have no option but to set aside the conviction and the sentence as

it cannot be allowed to stand on the considered ground of appeal alone.

Therefore, I find it unnecessary to give attention to the other grounds of appeal

urged before the Court.

Hence, I set aside the conviction and the sentence of the appellants by the

learned High Court Judge.

Page 19 of 20

The next matter I would like to draw my attention is whether this is a fit case to

be sent for a re-trial.

Considering the grounds upon a retrial should be considered, in the case of L.C.

Fernando Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 79-II NLR 313 at 374 it was held:

It is a basic principle of the criminal law of our land, that a retrial is to be

ordered only, if it appears to the Court that the interests of justice so require.

The charge laid against the accused is of serious nature, and it may be, a

trial Court may find the accused guilty at a retrial upon relevant and

admissible evidence. But it must be remembered that the acquisitions have

been made about seven years ago.

Further, the trial had been long and protracted. There have been no less

than thirty-five trial dates. The accused would have to bear undue hardship

and heavy expense to defend himself again. I must also state that the

defence in no way contributed to the reception of inadmissible and irrelevant

evidence, which prejudice the trial.

Under the circumstances, it seems to me to be harsh and unjust to order a

retrial. It does not appear to me that the interests of justice require a retrial.

In the case of Nandasena Vs. Attorney General (2008) 1 SLR 51, it was held:

A discretion is vested in the Court whether or not to order a retrial in a fit

case, which discretion should be exercised judicially to satisfy the ends of

justice taking into consideration the nature of the evidence available, the

time duration since the date of the appeal, the period of incarceration the

accused had already suffered, the trauma and hazards an accused person

would have to suffer in being subjected to a second trial for no fault on his

part and the resultant traumatic effect in his immediate family members

who have no connection to the alleged crime, should be considered.

Page 20 of 20

The incident relating to this case has occurred on 14-08-1996, nearly 28 years

ago. As observed correctly by the learned High Court Judge in the judgement as

well, it has taken nearly 20 years after the incident for the 1st witness to give

evidence before the trial Court. By that time, two of the accused had already

been dead, and after the conviction, another accused had also passed away.

The evidence of the key witnesses when they gave evidence nearly 20 years after

the incident shows that they have forgotten most of the material points. There is

no basis to believe that if they were to be called upon to give evidence again some

28 years after the event, their evidence would be reliable or can be relied upon

to find the accused guilty.

The appellants had been in incarceration from the date of their conviction on 08-

11-2017, which amounts to more than five years in total.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that no purpose would be

served by sending the case back for a re-trial after such a long period from the

date of the crime.

Therefore, I acquit the accused appellants from the charges.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

P. Kumararatnam, J.

I agree.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
