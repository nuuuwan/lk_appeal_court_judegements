JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the 1st

Appellant and 2nd Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Chilaw under

Section 296 of the Penal Code for committing the murder on Iswaralage

Kaushalya a female child on or about 02nd April 2005.

When the indictment was read over to the Appellants, they pleaded guilty for

the charge of murder, but the Learned High Court Judge ordered the trial to

proceed in usual manner as if the Appellants had not pleaded guilty as per

the Section 197(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

Thereafter the trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Chilaw as the

Appellants had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecutions case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence

and the Appellants had made a dock statement and closed their case. After

considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court

CA/HCC/190-191/17

3 | P a g e

Judge had convicted the Appellants under section 296 of Penal code and

sentenced them to death on 31/05/2017.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence due to

the Covid 19 pandemic. Also, at the time of argument the Appellants were

connected via Zoom from prison.

Background of the Case

The prosecution had called 9 witnesses and marked productions P1 to P6.

According to PW1, Pushpa Ranjani, she was legally married to 2nd Appellant.

This witness and the Appellants were living together at a room in the housing

scheme belonging to a tile factory named Silusavi. At that time, all three

were employed in the said tile factory situated in Punchi Lida Road,

Haldanduwana. The 1st Appellant is the mother of the dead child and the 2nd

Appellant had been harassing the child at that time and that he even kicked

the child while she was on the floor. The child was about 03 months old at

the time of her death.

On 05.04.2005, PW1 had gone for work in the tile factory, but the Appellants

have remained in the house with the deceased without going for work. On

that day when PW1 came for breakfast at about 9.30 am, she had heard the

infant crying and had seen the 2nd Appellant strangling the deceased. After

having noticed this, she had gone back to her workplace without having her

breakfast. When she returned in the afternoon, she had found the deceased

child was missing. When she inquired from the 1st Appellant about the child,

she had told her not to ask about the child. When she inquired from 2nd

Appellant about the child, he had not uttered a word.

CA/HCC/190-191/17

4 | P a g e

PW1, having felt suspicious about the disappearance of the deceased, had

informed this to PW3, Chandrakanthi, who in return conveyed this story to

her husband and the manager of the tile factory PW2, namely Mendis

Illangaratne. PW2, immediately brought this to the notice of the owner of the

tile factory PW7, Leslie Appuhamy. As per the instruction of PW7, PW1 had

gone to the Koswatte Police Station on 06.04.2005 and lodged the first

complaint. The police had commenced investigation after receiving this

information and found the dead body dumped in a plantation cultivation plot

adjacent to the land where the tile factory is situated. The corpse was sent

to the Chilaw base Hospital to conduct post mortem examination on

07.04.2005.

According to the police, after receiving the complaint they had commenced

investigation and looked for the Appellants but could not apprehend them

on 06.04.2005. On 07.04.2005, the Appellants were caught by village people

while hiding under a bridge and they were handed over to the police.

PW09, JMO Wijewardena had conducted the post mortem examination and

come to the conclusion that the death was caused due to difficulty of

breathing caused by the pressure applied on the neck and mouth of the

infant child.

When the defense was called the Appellants had made a brief dock statement

and denied the charge levelled against them.

Both Counsels jointly raised following appeal grounds on behalf of the

Appellants.

1. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the

circumstantial evidence placed before court is not sufficient to

arrive at a confirmation that the Appellants committed the offence

of murder as per the indictment.

CA/HCC/190-191/17

5 | P a g e

2. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the

prosecution has failed to prove the date of offence beyond

reasonable doubt.

3. The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the contradictory

and inconsistent version of prosecution witnesses and thereby the

conviction is bad in law.

In the first appeal ground the Appellant contends that the Learned High

Court Judge has wrongly concluded that the items of circumstantial

evidence are sufficient to come to the conclusion that the Appellants only

had committed the murder.

In the case of C.Chenga Reddy and others v. State of A.P.(1996) 10 SCC

193 the court held that:

In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the settled law is that the

circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is drawn should be

fully proved and such circumstances must be conclusive in nature.

Moreover, all the circumstances should be complete and there should be

no gap left in the chain of evidence. Further the proved circumstances

must be consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt of the accused and

totally inconsistent with his innocence.

In the case of McGreevy v. Director of Public Prosecution [1973] 1

W.L.R.276the court held that:

There is no requirement, in cases in which the prosecutions case is

based on circumstantial evidence that the judge direct the jury to acquit

unless they are sure of the facts proved are not only consistent with guilt

but also inconsistent with any other reasonable conclusion. The question

for the jury is whether the facts as they find them to be drive them to

the conclusion, so that they are sure, that the defendant is guilty.

CA/HCC/190-191/17

6 | P a g e

In the case of Attorney General v. Potta Naufer & others [2007) 2 SLR 144

the court held that:

When relying on circumstantial evidence to establish the charge of

conspiracy to commit murder and the charge of murder, the proved items

of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.

In the case of Kusumadasa v. State [2011] 1 SLR 240 the court held that:

The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused

had the opportunity of committing the offence. The accused can be found

guilty and only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is

consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence.

In Premawansha v. Attorney General [2009] 2 SLR 205 the court held that:

In circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to be drawn, such

an inference must be the one and only irresistible and inescapable

conclusion that the accused committed the offence.

In this case in order to find the Appellants guilty of the charge, all the

circumstances must point at the Appellants that they are the one who

committed the murder of the deceased and not anybody else. It is the

incumbent duty of the prosecution to prove the same beyond reasonable

doubt.

In this case according to PW01 at the time committing the offence, she and

the Appellants were living together in the same line room. The evidence

further revealed that even though the 2nd Appellant was legally married to

CA/HCC/190-191/17

7 | P a g e

PW1, he lived with 1st Appellant as well. Hence, the admissibility of the

evidence given by PW1 need to be discussed under Section 120(2) of the

Evidence Ordinance.

The Section states:

In criminal proceedings against any person the husband or wife of

such person respectively shall be a competent witness if called by the

accused, but in that case all communication between them shall cease

to be privileged.

The Learned High Court Judge had failed to resolve this legal position when

he accepted the evidence given by PW1, who was the legal wife of the 2nd

Appellant.

The Section 81 of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance states:

"Notwithstanding anything in the Evidence Ordinance contained, the

wife or husband of a person charged with an offence specified in the

First Schedule shall be a competent witness for the prosecution.

FIRST SCHEDULE

OFFENCES AGAINST CHILDREN AND YOUNG PERSONS IN RESPECT

OF WHICH SPECIAL PROVISIONS OF THIS ORDINANCE APPLY.

1. Any offence under Section 308 and 360 of the Penal Code.

2. Any offence against a child or young person under any of the

following Sections of the Penal Code;

Sections 296,297,343,345,357,360A,364,365,365A.

Hence, under Section 81 of the Children and Young Persons Ordinance, PW1

is competent witness for the prosecution.

In this case, PW1 had clearly seen the 2nd Appellant strangling the deceased

when she came home for breakfast. Although 1st Appellant was in the house,

CA/HCC/190-191/17

8 | P a g e

she did not take any attempt to prevent the deceased being strangled when

PW1 came home after work in the evening and inquired about the deceased,

the 1st Appellant had replied to her saying not to ask about the child.

Further, when PW1 asked the same from 2nd Appellant, he had not answered

her questions.

According to police investigation, when they came to the house where the

Appellants and the deceased lived, they were not to be found until

07.04.2005 when the villagers caught hiding under a culvert.

The previous and subsequent conduct of the Appellants also give rise to a

reasonable suspicion about them.

Section 8(1) and 8(2) of Evidence Ordinance are read as follows:

8 (1) Any fact is relevant which shows or constitute a motive or

preparation for any fact in issue or relevant fact.

8 (2) The conduct of any party, or of any agent to any party, to any suit

or proceedings in reference to such suit or proceedings or in reference

to any fact in issue therein or relevant thereto, and the conduct of any

person an offence against whom is the subject of any proceeding, if

such conduct influences or is influenced by any fact in issue or

relevant fact, and whether it was previous or subsequent thereto.

The evidence given by PW1 and PW9, JMO and the suspicious conduct of the

Appellants it is very reasonable that the trial judge had come to the

conclusion that the Appellants are responsible of the death of the deceased.

Hence, this ground appeal has no merit.

In the 2nd ground of appeal, the Counsels contend that the Learned High

Court Judge had failed to consider that the prosecution has failed to prove

the date of offence beyond reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC/190-191/17

9 | P a g e

In the indictment the date of offence has been clearly mentioned. PW1 giving

evidence had clearly said that the incident that she saw had taken place on

02.04.2005. Thereafter the deceased was not to be found until in the evening

of 07.04.2005.

PW9 had not mentioned the date of death but had mentioned that the

decomposed body of the deceased was brought to Chilaw Morgue on

07.04.2005 around 2.00 pm. While giving evidence, the JMO expressed an

opinion that the death of the deceased could have occurred 4-5 days prior to

the postmortem examination. The date of death mentioned in the indictment

clearly establish the date on which PW1 had seen the 2nd Appellant

strangling the deceased.

As per the Section 165 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979,

the Appellant had been given reasonable notice the time of incident. For

clarity the Section 165 of CPC is re-produced below:

165. Particulars as to time, place and person.

(1) The charge shall contain such particulars as to the time and place

of the alleged offence and as to the person (if any) against whom and

as to the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed as are

reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with

which he is charged and to show that the offence is not prescribed.

(2) When the accused is charged with criminal breach of trust or

dishonest misappropriation of movable property, it shall be sufficient

to specify the gross sum or, as the case may be, the gross quantity in

respect of which the offence is alleged to have been committed, and

the dates between which the offence is alleged to have been committed

without specifying particular items or exact dates, and the charge so

framed shall be deemed to be a charge of one offence within the

meaning of section 174:

Provided that the time included between the first and last of such dates

shall not exceed one year.

CA/HCC/190-191/17

10 | P a g e

(3) When the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned

in section 164 and the preceding subsections of this section do not

give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is

charged, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner

in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that

purpose.

In Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat (supra) the court held further:

In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an

occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the

spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect

people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters.

It is unrealistic to expect a witness to be a human tape recorder.

In R. v. Dossai 13 Cr.App.R. 158 the court held that:

A date specified in an indictment is not a material matter unless it is

an essential part of the alleged offence; the defendant may be convicted

although the jury finds that the offence was committed on a date other

than that specified in the indictment. Amendment of the indictment is

unnecessary, although it will be good practice to do so (provided that

there is no prejudice below) where it is clear on the evidence that if the

offence was committed at all, it was committed on the day other than

that specified.

As the Appellants had been given sufficient notice regarding the date of

offence under which they had been indicted and led plausible evidence

through witnesses regarding the period, I conclude that this has not caused

any prejudice or failure of justice. Hence, this ground of appeal has no merit

at all.

CA/HCC/190-191/17

11 | P a g e

In the 3rd ground of appeal, the Counsels contended that the Learned High

Court Judge had failed to consider the contradictory and inconsistent

version of prosecution witnesses and thereby the conviction is bad in law.

According to PW1, the incident had taken place on 02.04.2005 and she gave

evidence on 13.06.2012, seven years after the incident. Hence, it is not

possible to remember everything accurately as stated in the police statement.

In the case of The Attorney General v. Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa

(2011) 2 Sri L.R. 292 held that,

Witnesses should not be disbelieved on account of trifling discrepancies

and omissions. When contradictions are marked, the Judge should

direct his attention to whether they are material or not and the witness

should be given an opportunity of explaining the matter...The court

observed further, that human beings are not computers and that it

would be dangerous to disbelieve the witness and reject evidence based

on small contradictions or discrepancies.

In this case, no contradiction was marked and no omission was highlighted.

The Learned High Court Judge had correctly mentioned in his judgment.

Hence, this ground also has no merit.

The Learned Counsels in addition to above considered grounds of appeal,

further argued that the judgment pronounced in this case is devoid of proper

judicial analysis and evaluation of evidence and total disregard of the Section

283 of Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

Accordingly, the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the

Constitution of our country provides provisions to rectify any error, omission,

or irregularity in a judgment where such error, omission or irregularity which

has not prejudiced the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a failure

of justice.

CA/HCC/190-191/17

12 | P a g e

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No: 15 of 1979 states as

follows:

Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account-

(a) of any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrants, charge, judgment, summing up or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

Unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has

occasioned a failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

Article 138 of The Constitution of Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka

states:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an

appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact

or in law which shall be 111 [committed by the High

Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original

jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance], tribunal or

other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by

way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things

112 [of which such High Court, Court of First Instance]

tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgment, decree, or order of any

court shall be revised or varied on account of any

error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

CA/HCC/190-191/17

13 | P a g e

the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

Considering the Learned High Cout Judges judgment, I neither find

prejudice occasioned nor the occurrence of a failure of justice in this case.

As discussed under appeal grounds, the prosecution had adduced strong

and incriminating circumstantial evidence against the Appellants. The

Learned High Court Judge had very correctly considered all the evidence

presented by both parties and come to the conclusion that all the

circumstances are consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the

Appellants and totally inconsistent with their innocence.

As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellants for

the charge of murder, I affirm the conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the

Appellants.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to the High Court of Chilaw

along with the original case record.
