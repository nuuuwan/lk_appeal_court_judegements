This is an appeal preferred by the petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved by the judgement dated 10-05-

Page 4 of 7

2018 of the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of Southern

Province Holden in Hambantota.

From the impugned judgement, the learned High Court Judge has dismissed the

revision application filed by the appellant seeking to challenge an order

pronounced by the learned Magistrate of Hambantota on 26-06-2013, wherein

the learned Magistrate has ordered the appellant to deposit Rs. One million

based on his failure to produce a vehicle handed over to him on a bail bond of

one million rupees.

This is a case where this Court previously dismissed the appeal as the appellant

has failed to appear before the Court and pursue his appeal with due diligence.

However, upon an application to relist the appeal, this Court allowed the relisting

and heard the learned Counsel for the appellant, as well as the learned State

Counsel who represented the respondents-respondents.

The learned Counsel for the appellant at the very beginning of the argument on

this matter informed the Court that he will be relying on the written submissions

filed in that regard. However, the learned Counsel also conceded that he has a

very poor case to argue before this Court. The learned State Counsel made

submissions justifying the judgement of the learned High Court Judge as well as

the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota.

This is a case where a person has been charged before the Magistrates Court of

Hambantota for having transported cattle without a valid permit obtained from

the relevant authority, and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms

of the Animals Act.

The said accused has pleaded guilty to the charge against him and had been

sentenced. The learned Magistrate has confiscated the cattle that was illegally

transported and has decided to hold an inquiry as to whether the vehicle involved

in transportation of cattle, namely, vehicle number SP-LE-5212, allowing the

Page 5 of 7

registered owner of the vehicle to show cause as to why the vehicle should not

be confiscated in terms of section 3 of the Animals Act.

By that time, the said vehicle had been in the custody of its registered owner as

the vehicle had been released previously on a bond.

When the matter was taken up for inquiry, there had been a confusion as to

whom the vehicle had been released, and the learned Magistrate has directed the

Registrar of the Magistrates Court to hold an inquiry and report to whom the

vehicle was released on a bond. It has been reported to the Court that the vehicle

had been released to Lokugamage Lalith Chandra as the registered owner on a

bond of Rs. 1 Million rupees. The present appellant is the said registered owner

mentioned. The said vehicle has been released to the said Lalith Chandra on 26-

02-2007.

When the appellant was notified to appear before the Court, he has initially

denied that the vehicle was released to him, but upon inquiry, he has admitted

that the vehicle was released to him, but has stated that he sold the vehicle and

unable to produce the it for the purposes of the inquiry.

As the person who took charge of the vehicle as its registered owner, namely the

appellant, has failed to produce the vehicle for the purpose of the inquiry, the

learned Magistrate who was unable to hold the inquiry without the vehicle, has

decided to order the registered owner of the vehicle, namely the appellant, to

deposit the value of the bond upon which he got the vehicle released and

admittedly sold.

It is against this order that the appellant has preferred the mentioned revision

application before the Provincial High Court of Southern Province Holden in

Hambantota.

The learned High Court Judge of Hambantota after having considered the

relevant facts and the circumstances had found no reason to interfere with the

order of the learned Magistrate.

Accordingly, the revision application has been dismissed. It is against this

judgement and the order of the learned Magistrate of Hambantota; the appellant

has preferred this appeal.

Having considered the relevant facts and the circumstances, and the law that

led to the order of the learned Magistrate, it is the view of this Court that the

learned Magistrate has followed the correct procedure when deciding to order

the appellant to pay the value of the bond he executed. It is clear from the case

record that it had been the appellant who has taken charge of the vehicle after

signing the bail bond for a value of one million rupees.

When he was required to produce the vehicle for the purposes of the inquiry,

initially he has attempted to mislead the Court, making use of a situation that

existed then by saying that it was not he who got the vehicle released, but the

finance company who had a finance leasing agreement in relation to the vehicle.

Upon inquiry, it has been established that it was not so, and it was the appellant

who got the vehicle released based on a bond of Rs. one million.

It has also been established that the vehicle in question was a vehicle used in

several occasions previously in committing similar offences, which may be the

very reason why the appellant has disposed of the vehicle after getting it released

on a bond.

As the appellant has failed to produce the vehicle as required for the purpose of

the inquiry, the learned Magistrate had no option but to order the appellant to

pay the agreed sum mentioned in the bail bond. The learned High Court Judge

after having considered the relevant facts, circumstances and the law has come

to a correct finding in that regard.

The appeal is dismissed for the reasons considered above, as I find no merit in

the appeal preferred.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the

Provincial High Court of Hambantota along with the original case record.

The Registrar is also directed to forward a copy of this judgement to the

Magistrates Court of Hambantota for necessary implementation purposes.
