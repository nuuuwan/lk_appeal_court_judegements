The charges in the indictment were read over to both accused and they

pleaded not guilty to the charges. From the commencement of the trial,

the second accused absconded the Court and the trial proceeded

against him in his absence. After trial, the learned High Court Judge

convicted both accused in respect of all three charges leveled against

them and sentenced them. This appeal is preferred by the 1st accused-

appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) against the

conviction and sentence.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of both

parties. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Counsel for the

appellant and the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) for

the respondent made oral submissions.

In brief, the prosecution case is as follows:

PW-2 and PW-3 are husband and wife. On the day of the incident, about

2.00 am in the morning, PW-2, Dayaratne was sleeping with his wife in

one of the rooms of the house where they were living. Their two children

were also sleeping in the adjoining room. He had awakened hearing a

big noise like a bomb explosion. The front door of the house had fallen

into the living room. PW-2 had seen the 1st accused-appellant holding

a torch at him and another person carrying a torch, inside their house.

PW-2 has seen the two accused coming to the doorstep of the room

where PW-2 and his wife were sleeping. While PW-2 and PW-3 were on

their bed, one of the accused has attacked PW-3. PW-2 had stood up

shouting not to beat his wife and at that time the 1st accused-appellant

had attacked PW-2 using a cutting weapon, which PW-2 had explained

as a sword and caused injuries to his mouth. After this attack, PW-3,

the wife had turned a tube light that was kept near the bed they were

sleeping. PW-2 has also seen her wife injured and seen blood on her

chest and hand. He has seen a gun in the hand of the 2nd accused after

the attack.

The learned Counsel for the appellant advanced his arguments on the

following grounds of appeal:

i. The identification of the 1st accused-appellant had not been

established.

ii. The prosecution has not proved the case beyond a reasonable

doubt.

iii. Common intention doctrine cannot be applied in this case.

The main argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant was that

the prosecution witnesses have not properly identified the appellant.

The learned Counsel stated in his written submission that PW-1 has

not mentioned the names of any of the accused in the first complaint.

PW-1 made the first complaint to the police but this is not an incident

related to PW-1. The second count is an attempted murder charge in

respect of PW-3 and the third count is a grievous hurt charge in respect

of PW-2. In his evidence in Court, PW-1 has stated that her sister PW-

3 shouted that Upali and Kapila (the 1st and 2nd accused) assaulted her.

Then he had seen blood and injuries on the body of her sister and taken

her to the hospital. It is clear that when making the first information in

such a disturbing situation, PW-1 wanted to inform the police about

the serious incident occurred in his sisters place without any delay and

not the names of the people involved in the incident and other details.

In these circumstances, PW-1, not mentioning the names of the

accused in the first information does not cast a doubt regarding the

identification of the accused.

The other argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant with regard

to the identification was that PW-2 has stated in his evidence that the

person who came to the room has covered his face with a piece of cloth.

Also, the learned Counsel pointed out that according to the Medico-

Legal Report, when PW-2 gave the history to the doctor, he had stated

that he was assaulted by an unknown person who came to the house.

Page 5 of 8

The learned SDSG contended that PW-2 had identified the appellant

from his shape and the voice. Also, the learned SDSG stated that in re-

examination, PW-2 has stated that he identified the appellant and other

accused clearly with aid of lights switched on, when they were leaving

the house. The learned SDSG contended further that, anyhow, PW-3

has given cogent evidence regarding the identification of the accused

and she has clearly identified the appellant.

There is clear evidence that two persons entered their house, one person

who was armed with a gun fired at PW-3, the other person who was

armed with a sword assaulted PW-2, and then they went away.

Undoubtedly, there was no involvement of any other person to this

incident other than these two persons. PW-3 stated that she had

switched the emergency light and identified both persons as the 1st and

2nd accused. Although the faces were covered, when these persons were

seen at the first instant, it is clear from the evidence of PW-3 that after

she had switched the emergency light, she identified both persons as

the 1st and 2nd accused. There was no difficulty for her to identify both

accused because according to the evidence, PW-3 had known both

accused from their childhood and they were from the same village. In

addition, PW-3 has stated that the appellant threatened to kill them if

they divulged the names of the accused. From the said evidence, it is

very clear that even the appellant realized that she had identified him.

Also, it is evident that PW-3 identified the appellant and the other

accused because PW-1 stated in his evidence that when she met his

sister, PW-3 soon after the incident, she told him that the appellant and

the other accused assaulted her. Also, in the history given to the doctor,

PW-3 clearly stated that Upali and Kapila (the 1st and 2nd accused)

assaulted and the said item of evidence also demonstrate that PW-3

clearly identified the appellant and the other accused. Hence, even

though PW-2s evidence regarding the identification of the accused is

disregarded it is precisely clear from the evidence of PW-3 that the two

persons who came to her house and assaulted her and her husband

Page 6 of 8

were the appellant and the other accused. Hence, PW-3s evidence is

cogent and can be accepted without any doubt; no other evidence is

needed to establish the identity of the appellant. Hence, the

identification of the appellant is established beyond a reasonable doubt

and the first ground of appeal fails.

In this case, the appellant neither gave evidence nor made a statement

from the dock. The only witness called on behalf of the defence, a Senior

Superintendent of Police stated that he could not find the file that he

was asked to produce and give evidence. Therefore, there was no

evidence from the defence to be considered by the learned High Court

Judge in determining this case. Apart from the issues raised with regard

to identification, the learned Counsel for the appellant did not raise any

argument to demonstrate that the prosecution has not proved the case

beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution evidence has been

correctly and carefully analyzed by the learned High Court Judge.

Hence, I see no merit in the aforesaid second ground of appeal.

In replying to the aforesaid third ground of appeal, the learned SDSG

contended that this is one of the best cases that he has come across in

illustrating the doctrine of common intention. In the case of Queen V.

Mahatun 61 NLR 540, it was held that under Section 32 of the Penal

Code, when a criminal act is committed by one of several persons in

furtherance of the common intention of all, each of them is liable for

that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. If each of

several persons commits a different criminal act, each act being in

furtherance of the common intention of all, each of them is liable for

each such as if it were done by him alone.

To establish the existence of a common intention, it is not

essential to prove that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant

Page 7 of 8

to a pre-arranged plan. A common intention can come into existence

without pre-arrangement. It can be formed on the spur of the moment.

In Queen V. Vincent Fernando and two others - 65 NLR 265, it was

held that to be liable under Section 32, a mental sharing of the common

intention is not sufficient, the sharing must be evidenced by a criminal

act.

In the case at hand, the 1st accused was armed with a sword or a cutting

weapon similar to a sword. The other accused was armed with a gun.

Both of them used the weapons that they possessed. It is evident from

the Medico-Legal Report of PW-3 that there were gunshot injuries to

her. It transpires from the Medico-Legal Report of the PW-2 that the

third grievous injury explained in the MLR has been inflicted with a

cutting weapon. The intention of firing from a gun is to kill a person.

Therefore, the murderous intention is apparent. The appellant and the

1st accused came together armed with a gun and a cutting weapon,

entered the house of PW-2 and PW-3, caused injuries to them using the

weapons at their hands and left the house together threatening not to

disclose their names. Hence, the common intention is evident from their

criminal acts. In the instant action, two of the accused committed

different criminal acts, firing, and cutting, each act being in furtherance

of the common intention of them, each of the two accused is liable for

each such act as if it were done by one accused alone, as explained in

the aforesaid judicial authority. Therefore, the common intention of the

appellant to commit all three offences described in the three charges

has been established.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the learned High Court Judge has

come to a correct conclusion and there is no reason to interfere with his

Judgment dated 21.07.2022.

Accordingly, the conviction and the sentence imposed on the appellant

are affirmed. The appeal is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
