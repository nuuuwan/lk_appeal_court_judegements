Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

WICKUM. A. KALUARACHCHI, J. Counsel: K. G. R. Chathurangani with K. A. Chandana for the Petitioner Navodi de Zoysa, SC for the Respondent Argued on: Matter disposed by way of written submissions Written Submissions on: 24.01.2024 (by the Petitioners) 17.01.2024 (by the Respondents)

Decided on: 29.02.2024 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioners in this Application are seeking orders in the nature of Writs of

Certiorari quashing certain decisions of the Respondents to cancel and/or

refuse renewal of the Permits issued unto the Petitioners and inter alia Writs

of Mandamus directing the Respondents to renew and/or abide by certain

earlier decisions. In response, objections were raised, with Statement of

Objections being submitted on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, as well

as the 5th Respondent.

This Application concerns certain permits issued to the Petitioner under the

Mines and Minerals Act, No. 33 of 1992. The Petitioners are identified as

individuals conducting small-scale artisanal sand mining operations in the

vicinity of the Gal Oya river and the bridge situated in Ampara and were

previously holders of Artisanal Mining Licenses duly issued by the Geological

Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) (as substantiated by the Petitioners in the

tabulated contents of Paragraph 22 of the Petition). Thereafter, admittedly the

said mining licenses have expired, and subsequent licenses have not been

issued to the Petitioners. The Petitioners primary complaint is that the

Respondents have not thereafter issued licenses permitting them to carry out

such mining operations within the range of the specified area.

5

Any individual desiring to engage in mining activities must obtain a license

from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau (GSMB) specifically authorizing

such activities, subject to the terms and conditions delineated within the said

license. The GSMB issues a variety of mining licenses, all of which are

temporally limited. Typically, such licenses are granted for durations of less

than one year, although in instances of industrial mining, licenses may extend

for one year. Consequently, upon expiration of the validity period of a mining

license, individuals are required to reapply to the GSMB for license renewal.

The fundamental rationale behind the temporal/time-based limitation of

mining licenses is predicated on the presumption that circumstances

surrounding the license issuance are subject to change. Consequently, the

Authority consistently imposes a finite duration on licenses, thereby retaining

the discretion to periodically assess the necessity for license renewal.

The Petitioners have been granted Artisanal Mining Licenses for river sand

extraction in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Mines and

Minerals Act, No. 33 of 1992 (marked P5(i) to P5 (xiv)). The mining sites of

all Petitioners were situated in close proximity to the Gal Oya river and the

bridge located in Ampara, specifically within a radius of 1 and 2 km from the

Galoya bridge. This fact is acknowledged in the Petition, and the precise

mining locations of each Petitioner are delineated in Paragraph 22 of the

Petition.

It has consistently been the stance of all governmental stakeholders that a

clearance distance of 1 km should be upheld on both sides of the bridge to

mitigate any potential damages resulting from excessive sand mining.

However, multiple Applications for sand mining, including those from the

Petitioners, have been received within the range of 1km to 2km. While a

decision had been made at one point to allow sand mining beyond the 1km

mark, resulting in the issuance of mining licenses to the Petitioners, concerns

had arisen when numerous parties sought permission for mining within the

6

1km to 2km range. It was then understood by relevant government

stakeholders that such extensive sand mining in close proximity to the bridge

could lead to adverse effects on the bridge structure and negatively impact

the natural equilibrium of river systems. The rapid expansion of riverbed and

riverbank sand mining could potentially result in widespread environmental,

social, and economic ramifications. Consequently, there was an urgent need

to cease the issuance of mining licenses for river sand extraction within the

1km to 2km range to mitigate the adverse effects on the environment and the

structural integrity of the Gal Oya bridge, had such activities been permitted.

On or around the 23.12.2019, a meeting had been convened at the District

Secretariat office of Ampara, presided over by Wimalaweera Disanyake, State

Minister of Environment and Wildlife. During this meeting, the

aforementioned concern regarding sand mining activities near the Gal Oya

bridge was raised. Subsequently, it was directed by the then State Minister

that, in order to ensure the safety of the Gal Oya bridge, mining activities

within a 2-kilometer radius from the bridge should be ceased. This directive

was communicated to the Secretary of the Ministry of Environment and

Wildlife by the District Secretary of Ampara through a letter dated 21.01.2020

(marked 1R1).

Pursuant to the aforementioned directive, Artisanal Mining Licenses within a

2-kilometer radius from the Gal Oya bridge were withheld. Consequently, the

Welfare Society of Ampara Galoya River Permit Holders, Suppliers, and

Transporters conveyed their concerns to the Minister of Land Development,

Environment, and Wildlife via a letter dated 02.01.2020 (marked as IR2).

Subsequently, on 05.02.2020, the Regional Mining Engineer, acting through

the Senior Director (Mining), addressed a letter to the Director General of the

GSMB elucidating the prevailing circumstances. The letter emphasized the

necessity for conducting a thorough inquiry into specific matters outlined

therein, advocating for the formation of a technical group and emphasizing

the importance of conducting a field visit (marked 1R3). In accordance with

7

these directives, a field visit has been conducted on 12.03.2020, with the

participation of various state representatives, including the Divisional

Secretary of Ampara, officials from the Road Development Authority, National

Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), GSMB, and the Director of

Irrigation - Ampara. Observations and recommendations were provided by the

state representatives who partook in the field visit (marked 1R4(a) to 1R4(d)).

Following a comprehensive review of all recommendations provided by

relevant state representatives, a report was compiled by the Senior Mining

Engineer, detailing and summarizing the findings of the field visit on

12.03.2020, and presenting his own recommendations (marked 1R5(a)).

Then it was determined that no mining licenses for river sand extraction

would be issued within a 2-kilometer radius from the Gal Oya bridge.

Furthermore, additional field visits concerning the same matter had been

conducted with the participation of pertinent government stakeholders on

27.04.2022 and 09.11.2022. Both field visits concluded that maintaining a

safety buffer of 2 km on either side of the bridge is imperative to prevent

damage to the Gal oya bridge and the pipeline upstream of the Gal oya bridge

(marked IR6 and IR7).

These reports encompass the perspectives of all pertinent state

representatives. Upon examination of these reports, it is evident that each

state representative deliberated on whether mining activities within the 1km

to 2km range should be permitted, considering their respective contexts. For

instance, the Road Development Authority evaluated the potential impact of

such mining activities on the Gal Oya bridge, while the Regional Irrigation

Department assessed its potential impact on the Gal Oya lake.

Following a deliberative process, it has been ultimately determined that

Artisanal Mining Licenses for mining activities within a 2 km radius from the

Gal Oya bridge would not be granted to any party. As the mining sites of all

8

Petitioners were located within the 1km to 2km range from the Gal Oya bridge,

the Petitioners' were not successful in having their licenses renewed.

It is submitted by the Petitioners that sand mining activities are legally

permissible in certain other areas within the distance ranging from 1 km to 2

km surrounding the Adal Oya Bridge in Ampara, as well as the Kandy Road,

Maha Oya Bridge, Polwatta Karana Bridge, and Kotapola Bridge, all situated

within the Ampara region. They also submit that the principal causes of severe

damage to bridges is attributed to the forceful velocity of floodwaters. The

accumulation of sand dunes exacerbates the occurrence of floods by

disrupting the natural flow of water. Additionally, the Petitioners are of the

position that in view of the associated history and state policy supporting a 1-

km distance from the Gal Oya River and Bridge according to which the

Petitioners were previously granted permits at the designated sites, their

licenses/permits need to be renewed.

However, in light of the aforementioned circumstances, it becomes apparent

that subsequent to a meticulous examination comprising three distinct field

visits, and upon the unanimous consensus of all pertinent state authorities,

it has been conclusively determined that sand mining activities should not be

authorized within a 2 km radius of the Gal oya bridge and river. This

determination is grounded within the paramount objective of safeguarding

both the natural environment and the pertinent infrastructural edifice. In this

context, it is the view of this court that there exists no explicit statutory or

legal obligation on the Respondents mandating issuance or renewal of any

license thereto. Thus, I see no reasons that merit the grant of any of the writs

prayed for by the Petitioners.

Furthermore, Prayer (b) seeks a Writ of Certiorari to quash any decision of the

Respondents to revoke the permits granted to the Petitioners. However, there

exists no imperative to grant this remedy since no decision has been made to

revoke the permits bestowed upon the Petitioners. As pleaded in Paragraph

22 of the Petition, all permits issued to the Petitioners have reached the

9

expiration of their validity period. None of these permits were rescinded during

their term. Given that the permits are now void due to the lapse of their

validity period, the necessity to grant relief as per prayer (b) does not arise.

It is also imperative to note that Section 39 and 40 of the Mines and Minerals

Act, which stipulates the right of appeal afforded to a licensee in instances

where the licensee is aggrieved by a decision of the Geological Survey and

Mines Bureau (GSMB) to either cancel or decline to renew the license provides

an opportunity to appeal to the Secretary and therefrom to the Supreme

Court. Therefore, it is evident that the Mines and Minerals Act provides a clear

statutory remedy to an aggrieved licensee, mandating adherence to the

prescribed procedure, rather than resorting to the Writ jurisdiction under

Article 140, which constitutes a discretionary remedy. The Petitioners have

not succeeded in substantiating, nor have they provided any rationale or, at

the very least, notified the court as to the reasons behind their failure to utilize

such prescribed appeal procedure.

For the reasons detailed hereinabove, I dismiss the Application of the

Petitioners and make no order as to the costs of this Application.

Application dismissed. No costs.
