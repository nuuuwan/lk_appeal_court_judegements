JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter after referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General before the High Court of

Kandy under Sections 54(A)(b) and 54(A)(d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No.13 of 1984 for Trafficking

and Possession respectively of 2.80 grams of Heroin on 25th May 2013.

After the trial the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the learned

High Court Judge of Kandy has imposed life imprisonment for both counts

on 07th of June, 2023.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Counsel for the Appellant informed this Court that the Appellant had

given his consent to argue this matter in his absence. Hence, argument was

taken up in his absence but he was connected via Zoom platform from

prison.

On behalf of the Appellant, the following Grounds of Appeal were raised.

1. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

inconsistencies of evidence presented by the prosecution.

CA-HCC 0144/2023

3 | P a g e

2. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

vital discrepancy with regard to the quantity of Heroin recovered from

the Appellant.

3. The judgment of the learned High Court Judge is void of any reasoning

and lack basic principle of law.

PW1, SI/Jayananda, was the Officer-in Charge of the Anti-Corruption Unit

of the Kandy Police Station when he conducted this raid. While he and his

team were engaged in daily routine duty, they had received an information

from the Bogambara Prison about the discovery of Heroin by a prison Jailor.

PW1 had gone to the Bogambara Prison at 13:40 hours along with a police

team and had met PW11, Karunaratne, the Chief Jailor at the Prison. They

had been escorted inside the prison to meet PW10, Jailor Dissanayake who

had handed over the Appellant along with an envelope. PW10 had seen three

cellophane parcels inside the envelope. The contents were put onto a white

paper and weighed. 11 grams of substance were found in all three parcels.

As such, the Appellant was arrested for possession of Heroin

(diacetylmorphine). The production was entered into production register

under No.133/13 and handed over to PW7, PC Seneviratne. The Appellants

statement was recorded at the Bogambara Poison before the police party set

off from the prison. On their way, PW1 and his team had conducted two more

raids, arrested two other persons, and had handed them over to the reserve

police officer along with the Appellant.

PW2 PC Herath Banda was called by the prosecution to corroborate the

evidence of PW1.

On the day of the arrest of the Appellant, PW10, Jailer Dissanayake had been

entrusted with the duty of managing people who had come to visit the

inmates. The Appellant who was a Jail Guard had come to enter the prison

on that day. Having felt suspicious, PW10 had checked the Appellant in the

presence of the Chief Jailor at the Chief Jailers Office. Upon searching, a

cellophane bag with small packets suspected to be Heroin was discovered

CA-HCC 0144/2023

4 | P a g e

from the person of the Appellant. Initially the detected substance was sealed

temporarily by using the prison seal. Thereafter the Appellant and the

suspected Heroin packets were handed over to the police who came to the

prison upon being informed by the Chief Jailer.

In his dock statement, the Appellant took up the position that he was never

in possession of any dangerous drugs as claimed by the prosecution. Further

he was never shown any parcel that was allegedly to have been recovered

from him. Nothing was sealed nor weighed in front of him.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread as discussed in Woolmington v. DPP

[1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

In trials of this nature, the prosecution not only need to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt but should also ensure, with cogent evidence that

the inward journey of the production has not been disturbed at the all-

material points.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of

the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to fill

the gaps of badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the good

analysis for examination has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. A

prosecutor should take pains to ensure that the chain of events

CA-HCC 0144/2023

5 | P a g e

pertaining to the productions that had been taken charge from the

Appellant from the time it was taken into custody to the time it reaches

the Government Analyst and comes back to the court should be

established.

In the first ground of appeal the Appellant contended that the learned High

Court Judge had not considered the glaring inconsistencies between the

evidence presented by PW1, PW2 and PW10.

PW1 in his evidence took up the position that the weighing of the production

was done in front of the Appellant inside the prison. According to him when

he was on routine duty at Kandy Town, at about 1.30 p.m., he had received

the information from the prison regarding suspicious activity. As no scale

was available at the Kandy Police Station, he had borrowed the weighing

scale from the Police Welfare Shop. The relevant portion of the proceeding is

re-produced below:

Although he had taken the weighing scale from the Police Welfare Shop, he

had failed to check its accuracy. Further, although PW1 said that he went to

the prison with the scale and weighed the substances in front the Appellant

and the prison officials, in the B Report filed in the Magistrate Court of Kandy

he had mentioned that the substances were weighed at the welfare shop.

This was marked as a contradiction - V1. The relevant portion of the

proceeding is re-produced below:

PW10, the Jailer who handed over the Appellant to PW1 and his team

confirmed that the police had not weighed substances inside the prison. The

The above-mentioned contradiction clearly supported the defence version

and the dock statement of the Appellant.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant had pointed out another glaring

contradiction of the evidence given by PW1 and PW2. According to PW1 after

arresting the Appellant he and his team had gone to a hotel situated in

Hantana and arrested three more people before the Appellant was brought

to the police station. The relevant portions of the proceedings are re-

produced below:

This position was contradicted by PW2, who was called to corroborate the

evidence of PW1. According to PW2, after the arrest of the Appellant all had

come to the police station and he had remained in the police station with the

Appellant. PW1 had kept the production in his locker and taken the key with

him. The relevant portions of the proceedings are re-produced below:

Material contradictions create serious doubts as to the truthfulness of a

witness. Further it affects the prosecution case significantly and render the

testimony unreliable. Therefore, it is the profound duty of a judge to assess

whether the discrepancies undermine the overall credibility of the witness.

Further the judge must determine its impact on the case.

In number of cases the Apex Court of Sri Lanka repeatedly held that serious

contradictions which go to the root of the case render the prosecution

evidence unreliable.

Hence, the above noted contradictions are very serious in nature and will

affect the integrity of the prosecutions case.

In the second ground of appeal, the Appellant takes up the position that

there is a discrepancy in the weight of Heroin said to have recovered from

the Appellant and the Government Analyst Report. The Counsel for the

Appellant contends that the learned Trial Judge misdirected himself by

failing to analyse the discrepancy in weight of the substance allegedly

recovered which disturbs the production chain. He further submits that this

is a substantial fact, which the prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable

doubt.

This ground of appeal has direct impact on the first ground of appeal.

According to PW1, the recovered substances was weighed at the prison in

front of PW10 Jailer Dissanayake. But PW10 in evidence admitted that the

said substances were not weighed inside the prison premises.

Further, according to both PW1 and PW2 the substances was weighed using

a scale obtained from the police welfare shop. The gross aggregate weight of

the substance was 11 grams. Weighing such a meagre amount in a welfare

shop scale raises very serious doubts as to accuracy as most of the items

sold, at a welfare shop is over 100 or 250 grams.

When the productions were taken to the Government Analyst Department, a

notable difference had been noted in the parcel. According to the Government

CA-HCC 0144/2023

10 | P a g e

Analyst Report the weight of parcel was mentioned as 12.84 grams. This is

1.84 grams in excess to the original weight. Hence the Appellant argues that

the weight difference creates a serious doubt in the prosecution case as the

weight difference is very significant.

When this Court invited the Respondent to explain regarding weight

discrepancy transpired from the evidence, the Deputy Solicitor General

following the best traditions and highest standard admitted the weight

discrepancy in the production and further added that she is unable to

explain the reason.

Further, although PW1 said that the production was in his custody until he

returned to the police station with the Appellant, PW2 had said that the

Appellant was directly brought to the police station, was kept under the

custody of PW2 until the return of PW1. Another significant item of evidence

revealed by PW2 is that PW1 had stored the production recovered from the

Appellant in his personal locker until he returned to the police station after

concluding another raid.

This clearly shows that PW1 was handling the substances recovered from

the Appellant in a dangerous and unsafe manner. This position of the

Appellant clearly supports the weight discrepancy in the substance

recovered from the Appellant and sent to the Government Analyst

Department for analysis.

In Perera V. Attorney General [1998] 1 Sri.L.R it was held:

the most important journey is the inward journey because

the final analyst report will depend on that.

In the case of Koushappis v. The State of WA [2007] WASCA 26; (2007) 168

A Crim R 51 at para 85 the court held:

CA-HCC 0144/2023

11 | P a g e

Whilst the safe custody of critical exhibits such as these ought to be

readily proved by clear and specific evidence rather than being left to

inference, having regard to the way the case was conducted on both

sides, the evidence here was such in my view, as to allow the jury to be

satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the drugs that were analysed

were in fact those seized by police from the appellants house;

The afore-mentioned judgments clearly highlight the critical importance of

chain of custody evidence in drug-related offenses. They provide clear

guidance on how this evidence should be presented to satisfy the trial court.

Each piece of evidence requires thorough analysis to ascertain its origin and

who had access to it, ensuring no deviations from standard practice.

In cases revolving around drugs, chain of custody issues is of critical

importance. The prosecution must present undisputable evidence to

establish the chain of custody of the exhibits. Additionally, they must prove

that the item presented at trial is the same item originally in the possession

of or taken from the accused. Relying on tainted, unreliable, or tampered

evidence would undermine the integrity of the judicial system.

In this regard, the learned High Court Judge had made general comments

about weight discrepancy in his judgment. In absence of the evidence led

regarding this particular point; the comment made by the learned High Court

Judge has no doubt caused great prejudice to a fair trial.

The evidence placed by the prosecution with regard to the inward journey of

the products creates a serious doubt on the conviction against the Appellant.

Further, the evidence given by prosecution witnesses consists of

contradictions and improbabilities.

Considering the two grounds of appeal discussed above, it clearly supports

the stance taken by the Appellant in defence as well as in his dock statement

and certainly affects the root of the case. Hence, I decided not to address the

third ground of appeal.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned

High Court Judge of Kandy dated 07/06/2023 on the Appellant. Therefore,

he is acquitted from all the charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send a copy of this judgment to High

Court of Kandy along with the original case record.
