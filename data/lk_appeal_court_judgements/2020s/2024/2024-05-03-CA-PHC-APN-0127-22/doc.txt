JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named 1st Accused Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) was indicted along with 2nd Accused by the Attorney General on

following charge:

3 | P a g e

On or about the 10th November 2011 the accused jointly committed

the murder of Mohamed Ibrahim Riyaz which is an offence punishable

under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

When the indictment was read and explained to the Petitioner and the 2nd

Accused, they opted for a non-jury trial. Accordingly, the case was fixed for

trial. Before, the commencement of the trial it was reported that the

Petitioner and the 2nd Appellant had gone abroad without the leave of the

Court. Hence, an inquiry under Section 241(1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 was held and trial proceeded in absentia of

them.

At the trial, the prosecution had led twelve witnesses and marked several

productions and closed the case. Learned High Court Judge having satisfied

that the evidence presented by the prosecution established a prima facie case

against the Petitioner and the 2nd Accused, by his judgment dated

31.07.2009 convicted the Petitioner and the 2nd Accused as charged and

sentenced them to death.

The Petitioner being aggrieved by the judgment of the Learned High Court

Judge of Ampara, had filed this revision application stating to consider

following exceptional circumstances:

a) The entire trial beginning at the trial court is irregular as the Section

241 inquiry was based on hearsay evidence;

b) The Prosecution relied only on a single piece of evidence that the

deceased was seen in morning with the Petitioner which is not a

sufficient piece of circumstantial evidence to convict the Petitioner for

the offence of murder;

c) To attract the last scene theory the Prosecution had failed to establish

the exact time to death of the deceased;

d) The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the concept of

last scene theory in his impugned judgment; and

4 | P a g e

e) The Learned High Court Judge in his impugned judgment had no

considered the well-established principles pertaining to

circumstantial evidence in analysing the evidence for the Prosecution.

At the very outset of the hearing of this matter, the Learned Deputy Solicitor

General representing Hon. Attorney General informed that she is taking up

several preliminary objections as to the maintainability of this application

before this Court, and moved this Court to dismiss of this application in

limine. The Application was allowed.

The background of the case is briefly as follows:

According to PW1, he is the father of the deceased. On the date of the

incident, i.e. 10/11/2001, The Appellant and 2nd Accused had gone to this

witnesss house and accompanied his deceased son who was 16 years of age

at that time. At that time the deceased was carrying on a love affair with the

sister of the 2nd Accused. After leaving with them, the deceased did not return

home on that day. On the following day after receiving an information, he

had gone to the Ampara Hospital and identified his sons body.

PW2, who was a teacher by profession and help her husband who ran a retail

shop. On the day of the incident, when she was at her shop, three persons

had come to her shop and asked for tea. After staying some time, the said

persons went towards the jungle. After some time, school children who were

returning home after school informed PW2 that a person was lying fallen

with blood under a wood apple tree. They also told her that they had passed

this information to the nearby Army camp. When she saw the body, she

identified the dead body as one of the persons who visited her shop with two

others. According to her, the dead person is the youngest among the other

persons who came to her shop. She was attended the identification parade

and identified the Appellant and the 2nd Accused as persons who

accompanied the deceased and came to her shop.

5 | P a g e

It is well settled law that the revision is a discretionary remedy that can be

granted only upon exceptional circumstances. In the petition filed by the

Petitioner does not disclose any specific exceptional circumstances, which

he relies upon. The main contention is that irregular procedures had been

adopted to conduct the trial.

In Wijesinghe v Tharmaratnam (Sri kantha Law Report Vol-IV 47), the court

held that:

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the

Court.

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. V Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd. 1987 1

SLR 5 the Court held that:

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the

appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances

exist warranting its intervention.

In this case the Petitioner had gone abroad without the leave of the Court.

When he absconded, the Petitioner was aware very well that a serious case

was pending against him before the High Court of Ampara. As such, the

prosecution, furnishing necessary information through the police, led

evidence under Section 241(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15

of 1979 and proceeded the case against the Petitioner and the 2nd Accused

in absentia of them.

There is no any irregular procedure adopted by the Court as claimed by the

Petitioner. The Petitioner, in his affidavit admitted that he was continuously

in overseas due to his poor income. But he had left the country without

informing or getting prior approval of the High Court of Ampara. Therefore,

6 | P a g e

the Petitioner now cannot argue that the procedure adopted by the Court

under Section 241(1) of the CPC was irregular.

The Petitioner submits that the delay in lodging this revision application

before this Court is since he was continuously in overseas due to his poor

income and his application under Section 241(3) of the CPC to hear was

dismissed on 31.08.2022. As such, he instructed his Counsel to file this case

and therefore, he further, submits that he is not guilty of laches.

The Learned DSG, in her preliminary objections submits that this

application for revision was filed by the Petitioner after an inordinate delay.

According to her, the Petitioner and the 2nd Accused were convicted in

absentia and the sentenced them on 31.07.2009. The Petitioner had arrived

in Sri Lanka in May, 2022 and had been arrested at the airport and produced

before the High Court of Ampara. An inquiry under Section 241(3) of the CPC

was held and the Learned High Court Ampara refused the application for a

trial in denovo on 31.08.2022. This revision application was filed against the

order of Learned High Court Judge of Ampara. The Petitioner has taken one

and half months to come before this Court. The delay is not satisfactorily

explained.

Delay is a fatal error that would cause an application to be dismissed in

limine, if the petitioner fails to adduce sufficient and reasonable explanations

for such delay.

This matter was discussed at length in Rajapakse vs The State (2001) 2

SLR 161 which stated the following:

if this Court were to act in revision the party must come before Court

without unreasonable delay. In the instant case there is a delay of 13

months.

In this regard vide Justice Ismails judgement in Camillus Ignatious vs. OIC

of Uhana Police Station (Rev) CA 907/89 M.C. Ampara 2587 (Application

in revision) where His Lordship was of the view that a mere delay of 4 months

7 | P a g e

in filing revision application was fatal to maintain a revision application

before the Court of Appeal. His Lordship further added

These matters must be considered in limine before the Court decides to

hear the accused-petitioner on the merits of his application. Before he

could pass the gateway to relief his aforesaid contumacious conduct

and his unreasonable and undue delay in filing the application must be

considered and determination made upon those matters before he is

heard on the merits of the application.

The Learned DSG further submitted that the Petitioner has never pleaded or

averred that he was unaware of the case proceedings to trial in absentia or

the fact that he was unaware of the conviction and sentence at any point

from the date of such order or judgment or until application under Section

241(3) of the CPC was made. Hence, the Petitioner is time barred and has

now made this application in revision before this Court as he is compelled to

do so due to the unexpected arrest and imposition of the sentence.

The Petitioner admitted in evidence before the High Court that he did not

attend the trial after the indictment was served on him except for one day.

He had admitted that he did not take permission from Court to leave the

country knowing that he required to sign every month at the police station

in terms of bail conditions imposed on him. This clearly shows the Petitioner

has deliberately evaded the Court and violated the bail conditions as well as

the obligation to appear in Court.

In Sudarman De Silve v Attorney General [1986] 1 SLR 09 the Court held

that:

Contumacious conduct on the part of an accused is relevant only where

the exercise of a discretion vested in the court is involved.

8 | P a g e

In this case the Learned High Court Jude in his judgment dated 31.07.2009

considered all evidence presented and concluded that the Petitioner and the

2nd Accused were guilty to the charge of murder.

Considering all the circumstances of this case, especially the delay, the

contumacious conduct of the Petitioner and the absence of exceptional

circumstances, this Court conclude that this is not an appropriate case to

use discretionary power in favour of the Petitioner.

Therefore, this revision application is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Ampara for information.
