Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The primary issues of the instant Application emanate from Regulations 2020 (published

in Gazette Extraordinary No. 2165/1 on 02.03.2020) made under the National Gem and

Jewellery Authority Act No. 50 of 1993 (Act). Those Regulations have been promulgated

to prevent unlawful gemming and the unlawful removal of gems from Sri Lanka and also

for the purpose of issuing licences to carry on the gem industry as stipulated in sections

14(1)(f) and 15 of the said Act. Such Regulations read:

A licence shall not be granted to any person unless -

(a) he himself owns the land;

Page 3 of 12

(b) he has obtained the written consent of so many of the other owners as to

ensure that the applicant and such other consenting owners together own at

least two-thirds ownership of the land; or

(c) such person who is not a co-owner of the land, has obtained the written

consent of co-owners including lease hold rights for gemming as to ensure

that such consenting co-owners own at least two-thirds ownership of the

land,

in respect of which the application has been made.

Regulation 8 of the by-laws/original regulations made under the same Act also seem to be

similar to the aforesaid Regulations 2020 but the said original regulations have not been

tendered to Court by any of the parties.

The stand taken by the Petitioners is that they share co-ownership of the land upon which

the impugned Gem Mining License marked X10 was issued in favor of the 5th

Respondent. The Petitioners challenge the decision of the 3rd Respondent marked X6 and

the title investigation report marked X9. The 1st Respondent-National Gem and

Jewellery Authority (Authority) has communicated its decision to grant the Gem Mining

License (marked as X10) to the 5th Respondent based on the reasons contained in the said

X6 and X9. The Petitioners primarily seek a writ of certiorari quashing the said X6,

X9 and X10.

Referring to the 5th Respondent's application form for such license for the year 2022 (P27-

at bottom page 246 of the 'X1') and for the year 2023 (X8), the Petitioners claim that the

5th Respondent relies on Deed of Transfer No. 72 attested on 20.09.2021 (P30- at bottom

page 250 of the 'X1') in proof of his title. According to the schedule to the said Deed No.

72 the subject land is referred to as Halgaha Digana in Aluth Nuwara which is in extent

of A01- R00- P30. The Petitioners contention is that they also co-own the larger portion

of the subject land which is supposed to be a part of Halgaha Digana.

The Petitioners plead that the 1st Petitioner is entitled to a total of 6/20 shares whilst the

2nd Petitioner is entitled to a total of 4/20 shares based on their title deeds. The 1st and 2nd

Page 4 of 12

Petitioners claim entitlement to the total of 10/20 share (1/2 share) of the co-owned land

within the said larger land namely, 'Halgaha Digana' which is in extent of 3 Amuna.1

On a careful consideration of the contents of the said Deed of Transfer No. 72 by which

the 5th Respondent allegedly acquired title, it is noted that the said transfer has taken place

subject to the Rajakari Panguwa of the Uggal Aluth Nuwara Kataragama Dewalaya. The

interest of the said Dewalaya in the subject land could be further evinced based on the letter

marked X11 dated 08.04.2022 through which the Basnayake Nilame tenders the auction

report marked X12. Accordingly, the said Dewalaya is to be provided with 1/10th of the

monthly total proceeds after auctioning the gems.

As opposed to the Petitioners contention, the 5th Respondent argues that the land in respect

of which the impugned gemming license has been issued is not part of the said larger co-

owned land called Halgaha Digana. Further, it is stated that the land subject to the

impugned gemming license (X10) is a separate and distinct land free from any prior co-

ownership rights. The said arguments of the 5th Respondent are based on a Statutory

Determination (SD) made by the Land Reform Commission (LRC) under the Land

Reform Law No. 1 of 1972. Accordingly, the contention of the 5th Respondent is that the

land subject to the impugned gemming license is within the land described in the SD

published in Gazette Extraordinary No.1780/14 dated (16.10.2012) marked P42.

The 5th Respondent in this regard relies on the judgement of Jinawathie and Others v.

Emalin Perera (1986) 2 Sri L.R. 121. Accordingly, he asserts that;

Once the statutory determination is made the person in whose favour it was made

becomes owner of the land specified in the determination with all the incidents of

ownership. The land does not then cease to be a distinct and separate entity and it

does not become once again an undivided portion of the larger land from which

such specified portion was carved out.

I do not hesitate to accept the findings of the five eminent judges of the Supreme Court in

the above judgement. However, a reasonable question arises as to whether this Court

could adopt such findings unequivocally into the issues of the instant Application. In this

1 Generally, one Amuna's sowing is equal to 2 acres, 2 roods and 37 perches in the case of Paddy. See- http://www.negombolawsociety.com

Page 5 of 12

backdrop, I need to firstly, draw my attention to the following specific paragraphs of the

aforesaid judgement.

Sec. 72 of this Law is the provision which has to be resorted to in such a situation. The

provision of this section requires, by the use of a statutory fiction, the interests of a co-owner,

which would, at the time this Law comes into operation be only an undivided share of a larger

land owned in common, to be treated as a distinct and separate entity. Such an assumption

is only "for the purposes of this Law". The purpose, as already stated, is primarily to

determine the extent of the holding of such a person so that such holding could thereafter be

restricted to an extent of only 50 acres. (Emphasis added) (at p.129)

The moment this Law comes into operation the undivided share of a co-owner, whether he

be one whose interests are over fifty acres or not, becomes, in the eye of the law, a distinct and

separate entity, equal to the undivided extent he was earlier entitled to in the common land.

Such entity is, at that time, still not identified or located on the ground, as distinct from the

larger land. (Emphasis added) (at p.129)

The effect of the operation of the provisions of sec. 7 is to bring about a separation or partition

of the undivided share of a person, who, at the time this Law comes into operation, owns such

interests in common with several others, and transform such undivided share into a distinct

and separate portion. Even though still only notional and only existing on paper, yet, the law

requires the extent of land such person is entitled to, to be treated as a distinct and separate

entity. (Emphasis added) (at p. 129)

Even in regard to the determination of the specific portion to be given over to a statutory

lessee, who was once a co-owner, the other co-owners would not be without an opportunity of

making representations to the Commission if their interests are affected. Even though there is

no express provision granting an affected co-owner an opportunity of being heard before a

statutory determination is made, yet, as the concept of determination connotes a hearing of

affected parties, "the justice of the common law" will step in and provide him with such

opportunity. (Emphasis added) (at p. 133)

2 The said section 7 of the Land Reform Law- For the purposes of this Law, where any agricultural land is co-owned, each co- Owner shall be deemed to own his share in such land as a distinct and separate entity.

Page 6 of 12

Sec. 29 of this Law, which is relied on strongly by the defendants-appellants, provides for a

notice calling upon "every person who was interested in such land immediately before the date

on which such land vested" to claim "the whole or any part of the compensation payable

under this Law in respect of such land". Hence it has been contended that, in the case of an

agricultural land such as Flensberg Estate, which was co-owned by the plaintiff-respondent

and the defendants-appellants immediately prior to 26.8.1972, each one of such co-owners

would come within the category of "Every person who was interested in such land" and as

such each one of them could claim a proportionate share of the compensation payable by the

Commission in respect of the land which has vested in the Commission. (Emphasis added)

(at p. 136)

The agricultural land, which is vested in the Commission and in respect of which

compensation is payable under this section, is the entirety of the agricultural land which the

statutory lessee owned on the day preceding the 26th August 1972, less the extent of fifty acres

which the Commission permits such lessee to retain. (Emphasis added) (at p.136)

Applying the provision of this section to the facts and circumstances of this case, the land, in

respect of which such compensation is payable, would be the extent of 78 acres, which the

plaintiff-respondent was deemed to own as a distinct and separate entity from and out of

Flensberg Estate, less the extent of 50 A.OR.21 P. depicted as Lot 6 in plan P8. The said

extent of 78 acres, treated as distinct and separate entity, was taken away from the plaintiff-

respondent on the basis that the plaintiff-respondent was the owner of the said entity. No

dispute had been raised by any of the other co-owners, the defendants-appellants and the wife

of the 3rd defendant-appellant, to the title of the plaintiff-respondent to the said extent of 78

acres. The 50 acres, which is described in P6 and which by then has been actually

demarcated on the ground, within the said Flensberg Estate, is an extent carved from and

out of the aforesaid extent of 78 acres, and given to the plaintiff-respondent as the maximum

extent of land the plaintiff-respondent will thenceforth be permitted to hold. (Emphasis

added) (at pp. 136, 137)

After an in-depth study of the above judgment in the said Jinawathie case I take the view

that the Supreme Court has never implied to cure any defects of title that existed before

the Land Reform Law came into operation (i.e., 26.08.1972) or before publishing the

respective SD. The final conclusion in relation to the Land Reform Law in the judgement

is based on a specific purpose and it is to determine primarily the extent of the holding of

Page 7 of 12

a declarant under the said Law and thereafter to restrict such holding to an extent of 50

acres. As per the requirement of law, it is important to ascertain the extent of such a portion

of land, for the same to be treated as a distinct and separate entity. In this regard the

relevant block of land to be actually demarcated on the ground is also very important. The

said judgement has been formulated in a scenario where none of the co-owners, the

defendants-appellants and the wife of the 3rd defendant-appellant of the said Jinawathie

case have not raised any dispute to the title of the plaintiff-respondent to the extent of 78

acres referred to therein.

Another significant aspect considered by the Supreme Court in the said judgement is the

necessity of giving an opportunity for the co-owners to make representations to the LRC

if their interests are affected. Thus, the connotation of hearing of affected parties has been

established in the said judgement. The Supreme Court has observed that even after a

particular portion of land is considered as distinct and separate from the larger land, each

one of the co-owners would come within the category of every person who was interested

in such land.

However, when considering the facts and circumstances of the instant case, it becomes

clear that the Petitioners and the 5th Respondent are at disagreement over whether the land

upon which the impugned gemming license was granted is a portion of the larger land

called Halgaha Digana. It is paramount to note that the Land Reform Law applies only

to agricultural land as such a crucial question arises in the instant Application whether

paraveni nilakaraya''3 is left out of the definition of agricultural land stipulated in the said

Law. While it is debatable whether the subject land qualifies as Dewalagam Land, the

reference to the "Rajakari panguwa" 4in the said Deed of Transfer No. 72 implies that the

Uggal Aluth Nuwara Kataragama Dewalaya is also an interested party whose rights may be

3 According to SAWERS there were four chief classes of tenants (q), namely; - (c) Nilakarayas, who held panguwas on condition of cultivating the muttettu, or performing services attached by custom to their particular holdings. (Vide- 'The Laws and Customs of the Sinhalese or Kandyan Law' by Frederic Austin Hayley, Navarang, New Delhi 1993 at p.239).

4 "paraveni pangu shall mean an allotment or share of land in a temple or nindagama village held in perpetuity by one or more holders, subject to the performance of certain services to the temple or nindagama proprietor; (Vide- 'Buddhist Ecclesiastical Law' by Wickrema Weerasooria, 2011, p.211).

affected if the license were granted to any of the parties involved in the instant Application.

No adequate evidence has been made available to this Court through affidavits to arrive

at a clear finding on the actual title of the Petitioners or the 5th Respondent. Although the

5th Respondent has tendered to this Court a pedigree such has been annexed only to his

written submissions.

In addition to the above, the Petitioners contend that the land subjected to the said Deed

No. 72 is also an undivided land and thus, the predecessors of the 5th Respondent had no

divided land/share to transfer in favour of the 5th Respondent. Further, the Petitioners

referring to Deed No. 1745 attested on 09.08.1995 (at bottom page 290 of X1) assert that

the 3rd vendor to Deed No. 72 having undivided 1/4th share of 'Halgaha Digana' land

(which is the extent of 3 Amuna) could not possibly transfer a divided portion of land as

described in the schedule to the said Transfer Deed No. 72.

A careful consideration of the contents of the SD marked P42 implies that the said SD

has been made to deposit the same in favour of the testamentary case No. 31/T which was

pending in the District Court of Panadura. Furthermore, the 5th Respondent's claim in

respect of the SD is based on the block of land described in its item 16. The said block of

land is described in the SD as an undivided portion of Lot No. 199 which is within the

'Halgaha Digana' land and its extent is A00- R02- P15. However, the license marked as

'X10' has been issued in respect of a portion of the said Lot No. 199 which is in extent of

A01- R00- P30. Thus, it appears that the license 'X10' has been granted to a larger land

than the block of land secured under the said SD. This clearly implies that the land

described in item No.16 in the SD marked 'P42' has not been clearly identified or located

on the ground and it is further evinced with the existence of the word 'undivided' in the

said paragraph of the SD. Therefore, claims made by the 5th Respondent based on the said

SD need to be considered only upon clear evidence in respect of his actual title.

Moreover, the judgement in the said Jinawathie case has been pronounced well before the

said Act came into operation and as such there was no necessity for the Supreme Court to

give thought to the Regulations promulgated under the said Act. Those Regulations

expressly restrict the Authority granting any gemming license to any person unless such

person fulfills the specific requirements in Regulations 2022. Hence, the Authority is duty

bound to inquire whether those requisites have been duly satisfied before granting license

to any person especially when the land described in the SD cannot be physically identified

Page 9 of 12

or located on the ground and further, the extent of the land described in the SD and in the

respective license are distinct.

Furthermore, the plaintiff- respondent of the said case has instituted the respective action

in the District Court of Kurunegala seeking for a declaration of title and an ejectment order

in respect of a land described in a SD whereas the instant Application deals with a

gemming license under the said Act.

In the above circumstances, I hold that the dicta and the final determination of the

Jinawathie case cannot be applied to the facts and circumstances of this case in which the

parties are at variance on several key aspects. Having considered the applicability of the

said Jinawathie case I must now consider whether the relevant officials of the said

Authority have followed the due process when arriving at the decisions reflected in the

impugned documents marked X6 and X9.

The 3rd Respondent in the said letter marked X6 with concurrence of the 2nd Respondent

(dated 31.08.2023) has expressed the reasons for the decision to grant the gemming license

in favour of the 5th Respondent based on application form marked X8. Such reasons given

by the 3rd Respondent stem from the said SD marked P42. He has arrived at a conclusion,

based on the said SD, that the land upon which a gemming license was sought by the 5th

Respondent is not an undivided land. It is important to draw my attention to the following

paragraph of X6;

CA 78/2022

,

,

,

2/3

,

0131385

Page 10 of 12

.

I believe that the long sentence quoted above raises ambiguity about the undivided 2/3rd

portion and also how the 3rd Respondent has arrived at such a decision. In my view the 3rd

Respondent has failed to consider any of the vital issues I have mentioned above in this

judgement. It is obvious that the 3rd Respondent has not considered relevant material

concerning the question of whether the land subject to the gemming license ('X10') is co-

owned. The 3rd Respondent ought to take into account several other issues regarding the

title of parties including the issue whether the land described in item 16 of the SD can be

separately and distinctly identified and located on the ground of the larger land called

'Halgaha Digana'. This is especially because the determination of the said Jinawathie case,

as I have decided earlier, cannot be applied to the instant case. Whether the subject land

falls within the category of 'dewalagam' lands is also a vital issue that needs to be addressed.

Similarly, I take the view that the 3rd Respondent has not adopted the due effect of the

aforesaid Regulations when arriving at the impugned decisions. It appears that the 3rd

Respondent has not taken into consideration the said Regulations 2020 and has failed to

exercise his duties diligently by not duly inquiring upon the specific requisites mentioned

therein. In other words, the 3rd Respondent without giving effect to the two main limbs

(i.e., (i) Ownership of the land; (ii) consent of the other co-owners who own at least 2/3rd

ownership) of the said Regulations 2020 has attempted to give an undue interpretation to

what was decided in the said Jinawathie case even without making a single reference to

the said Judgement. It is a puzzle to this Court as to how the 3rd Respondent gained such

wisdom to adopt the rationale in the said Jinawathie case to overlook the fundamental

requisites stipulated in those Regulations.

I take the view that claiming the ownership of a separate and distinct portion of land

described in a SD issued under the Land Reform Law may confirm any person's ownership

of a land. Nevertheless, for the purpose of issuing a gemming license under the Act,

proving ownership through a SD is not sufficient when the extent of the land in the SD

and in the license are different and the land described in the SD cannot be separately and

distinctly identified or located on the ground. Especially when a land subjected to a SD

cannot be separately and distinctly identified or located on the ground, as in the case, such

Page 11 of 12

a SD cannot undermine the operation of the other main limb of the Regulations mentioned

below:

(a) the 5th Respondent has obtained the written consent of so many of the other

owners as to ensure that the applicant and such other consenting owners together

own at least two-thirds ownership of the land; or

(b) such a person who is not a co-owner of the land has obtained the written consent

of co-owners including leasehold rights for gemming to ensure that such consenting

co-owners own at least two-thirds ownership of the land.

It is further noted that the 3rd Respondent has failed to hear all the interested parties such

as the Uggal Aluth Nuwara Kataragama Dewalaya whose rights tend to be affected. As the

5th Respondent has submitted the application forms for such license for the year 2022 and

2023 based on his title referred to in Deed of Transfer No. 72, the 3rd Respondent should

have given thought to the genuineness of the information provided specifically in cage 10

of the both the aforesaid application forms ('P27' of 'X1' and 'X8')

On the other hand, the decisions reflected in the title investigation report marked 'X9' have

been reached on the basis that the land subject to the license 'X10' and the SD are one and

the same land. The Inquiry Officer has failed to consider the difference of the extent of the

land mentioned in 'X10' and the SD. No reasons have been given as to how the license has

been granted in respect of a larger land than the land described in the SD marked 'P42'.

The Petitioners strenuously argue that the relevant officials of the Authority have given a

wrong interpretation in the said 'X9', to the interim order issued by this Court on

28.03.2022, in the application bearing case No. CA/Writ/78/2022 filed by the Petitioners

named above. This Court in the said order issued an interim relief as prayed for in

paragraph (d) (i) of the prayer of the said petition and accordingly restricted the Authority

to issue license to the 5th Respondent. I am not convinced with the reasons given by the

Authority for them to deviate from the said interim order and to make contrary decisions

causing prejudice to the interested parties whose rights have been affected. The Authority

or any of its officials cannot take law into hand and take such arbitrary decisions perhaps

for their personal gains.

Therefore, I hold that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the unnamed Inquiry Officer who

issued 'X9' have taken decisions without taking into consideration the relevant material

Page 12 of 12

but considering irrelevant material. In light of the reasons given above, I am of the opinion

that the objections raised on behalf of the 1st to 4th Respondents have no bearing to the

facts and circumstances of the instant Application and therefore, those objections are

devoid of merit.

In the circumstances, I proceed to issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions

contained in the documents marked 'X6', 'X9' and also the license marked 'X10'. Anyhow,

I am not inclined to grant any other reliefs as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition.

However, this judgement is not an impediment for the Authority to arrive at a fresh but a

lawful decision upon fresh applications that may be submitted by any party for license in

respect of any portion of the land subjected to this case. The Authority must assay such

applications considering relevant material based on lawful grounds and also according to

law.
