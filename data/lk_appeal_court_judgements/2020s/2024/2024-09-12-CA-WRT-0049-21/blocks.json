Upon the complaint made by the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent inquired into the matter and thereafter, on the instruction of the 2nd Respondent (P18) decided that the impugned permit issued to the 3rd Respondent was lawful. The Petitioner states that he had a legitimate expectation of a permit being issued to him in view of continued possession of the land in dispute.

It is borne out from the documents marked as P7 and P8 that the 1st Respondent had inquired into the dispute between the Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent pertaining to the permit in dispute, and thereafter, the 1st Respondent had informed the Petitioner by letter dated 25-08-2020 marked as P10 that the Permit issued to the 3rd Respondent in 1996 was lawful as the 3rd Respondent had been in possession of the subject matter around 40 years. By letters dated 31-08-2020 (P12) and 22-09-2020 (P13), the Additional District Secretary of Anuradhapura and the Assistant Land Commissioner of North Central Province (P13) respectively requested the 1st Respondent to inquire into this matter. Accordingly, after inquiry, the 1st Respondent by letter dated 28-09-2020 informed the Assistant Land Commissioner of North Central Province (P16), that the permit in dispute had been issued to the 3rd Respondent in 1996 as he has been in possession for the last 40 years. Thereafter, by letter dated 27-10-2020, the Commissioner of Land, North Central Province (P18), informed the 1st Respondent that the permit in dispute had been issued to the 3rd Respondent in accordance with the third schedule of the said Ordinance. Having scrutinized the documents tendered, it is abundantly clear that the 3rd Respondent has been in possession of the land in dispute. The Petitioner failed to establish the fact that he is in possession. In this scenario, it appears to this Court that the impugned permit issued to the 3rd Respondent (Grandson of the original permit holder) is within the purview of the Land Development Ordinance.",
