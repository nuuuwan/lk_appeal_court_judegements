JUDGMENT

M.C.B.S. Morais J.

This is an appeal under and in terms of section 34(1) of the Right to Information Act No. 12

of 2016 read with Court of Appeal Rules.

The Public Authority-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) is a Licensed

Commercial Bank operating pursuant to the provisions of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988,

and constituted as a body corporate in accordance with the Peoples Bank Act No. 29 of

1961. The 1st Respondent Commission is a statutory body corporate established under and by

Page 3 of 9

virtue of Section 11 of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016. The Appellant

Respondent is the individual who has submitted the request for the information at issue.

The AppellantRespondent, through an information request dated 25th July 2022, sought

specific details pertaining to the expenditure incurred in connection with the 2022 Poson

Poya almsgiving and the Poson Bathi Gee event organized by the Buddhist Society of the

Anuradhapura Regional Branch of the Petitioner Bank.

The Information Officer of the Petitioner, by letter dated 9th August 2022, responded to the

aforementioned request and denied the providing of the requested information. This refusal

was made allegedly in pursuant to and in accordance with Section 5(1)(a) of the Right to

Information Act No. 12 of 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the RTI Act), on the grounds

that the information sought constituted third-party information.

The AppellantRespondent subsequently lodged an appeal with the Designated Officer of the

Petitioner Bank through an application dated 15th August 2022, pursuant to Section 31 of the

RTI Act. The Designated Officer formally acknowledged receipt of this application by way

of a letter dated 17th August 2022.

The Designated Officer, through a letter dated 19th September 2022, affirmed the decision

rendered by the Information Officer.

Dissatisfied with the decision of the Designated Officer, the AppellantRespondent submitted

an appeal dated 27th October 2022 to the RTI Commission, pursuant to Section 32 of the RTI

Act. The RTI Commission served the notice of appeal on 13th January 2023.

The RTI commission entered decision dated 31.08.2023 which was communicated to the

Petitioner Bank by letter dated 07.09.2023 which was delivered to the Petitioner on

13.09.2023 and directed the release of all information stipulated in the Information Request

of the Appellant-Respondent.

The Petitioner, being aggrieved by the decision of the RTI Commission appealed to this court

in terms of section 24(1) of the Right to Information Act No.12 of 2016 under the following

grounds.

Page 4 of 9

a. The impugned decision marked X8 is tainted with procedural impropriety as the

commission has acted in gross violation of Section 34 (1) of the Right to Information

Act in compelling the release of the contested information prior to the expiration of

the statutory period of the appeal;

b. The impugned decision is misconceived in law, arbitrary, contrary to law and

established judicial principles and conflicts with the rights/ interests of third parties in

violation of Article 14A (2) and Article 28 (e) of the Constitution.

c. The commission has gravely erred in law by the mis-application of Section 5 (1) (a)

of the RTI Act in contravention of Article 14A (2) and Article 28 (e) of the

Constitution by failing to appreciate that the information request involves the release

of personal information of third parties.

d. The commissioner has gravely erred in law by failing to conclude that columns 2, 3

and 4 in the Table depicted in the request for information all require disclosure of

personal information of third-party suppliers, including supplier details and costs

charged by the suppliers for the requested products and/ or services.

e. The impugned decision is void ab initio as the commission has gravely misdirected

itself by failing to judicially consider the Decision of the Designated Officer as

contained in Letter dated 19.09.2022 marked X4 which forms the basis of the appeal

in terms of Section 32 of the RTI Act.

f. The impugned decision is ultra vires, ill-conceived in law and fact and arrived at in

breach of the principles of natural justice as it fails to inter alia consider and/or

address the position taken up by the Public Authority in the Decision of the

Designated Officer as well as its Written Submissions tendered during the inquiry

before the commission.

g. The commission has gravely erred in fact and law by failing to take cognizance of the

fact that the almsgiving for the 2022 poson programme received financial

contributions from various third parties unrelated to the Petitioner, as corroborated by

the Letter of Request for Contributions issued by the Buddhist Society of the

Anuradhapura Regional branch of the Peoples Bank, annexed to the written

submission of the Public Authority;

h. The commission has gravely erred in law by failing to take cognizance that all funds

for the almsgiving for the 2022 Poson Programme were collected and deposited in the

account maintained by the Buddhist Society of the Anuradhapura Regional branch of

the Peoples Bank, and thereby failed to take cognizance of the fact that the requested

Page 5 of 9

information was within possession, custody or control of the Buddhist Society of the

Anuradhapura Regional branch of the Peoples Bank and not the Public Authority

within the meaning of Section 3(1) of the RTI Act.

i. The impugned decision is tainted with futility and unenforceable, as it is not possible

to identify the amounts contributed by the Public Authority for each of the items listed

in the table depicted in the request for information, as payments made to suppliers

were from contributions received from all parties, including third party contributors.

j. The commission has gravely misinterpreted the provisions of the Right to Information

Act No. 12 of 2016 by failing to determine that the burden of proving the existence of

any relationship to any public activity or interest and/or larger public interest, as

evidenced by Section 5 of the Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016, is upon the

Appellant- Respondent.

k. The commission has gravely erred in law by failing to engage in the balance of

competing interests of third parties as safeguarded in terms of Article 14A (2) of the

Constitution and Section 5(1) (a) of the RTI Act.

Hence, the Petitioner seeks relief from this Court to;

a) Issue notice on the Respondents;

b) Issue an Interim Order to stay the execution of the decision of the Right to

Information Commission as communicated to the Public Authority undercover of

the letter dated 07.09.2023 marked X8 until final determination of this

Application;

c) Set aside the said decision of the Right to information Commission marked X8

dated 07.09.2023 sent under the registered cover;

d) Grant costs; and

e) Such other and further relief as to this court shall seem meet.

When this matter was supported exparte on 13th of November 2023, the court was pleased

only to issue notice as for prayer a) above. Thereafter, the Respondents having come before

this court, and having filed their objections, this matter was argued before this court on 18th

of September 2024 and thereafter both parties filed their written submissions at the registry. I

have duly considered the materials submitted to us orally and in writing.

According to the section 5(1)(a) of the RTI Act,

5. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) a request under this Act for access to

information shall be refused, where

(a) the information relates to personal information the disclosure of which has no

relationship to any public activity or interest, or which would cause unwarranted

invasion of the privacy of the individual unless the larger public interest justifies the

disclosure of such information or the person concerned has consented in writing to

such disclosure;

The Petitioners principal argument for withholding the requested information rests on the

contention that the information sought by the Appellant-Respondent pertains to several third

parties. Due to the involvement of multiple external parties and the potential implications for

their rights and interests, the Petitioner asserts that disclosing such information would be

improper and, therefore, deny the request on these grounds. They maintain that the

dissemination of third-party information, without appropriate consent or legal basis, could

infringe on privacy rights and other protections afforded to these individuals or entities.

Consequently, the Petitioner argues that the request for information must be rejected to

uphold these legal and ethical considerations.

However, the Appellant-Respondent, in their information request dated 25th July 2022, has

sought the following details.

This appeal has been allowed by the Right to Information Commission; thus, our duty is to

consider whether the Petitioners appeal bears sufficient merits to quash the decision of the

RTI Commission.

Under subsection 5(1)(a), it is argued that the requested information pertains to personal

information. However, upon analyzing this provision in conjunction with the information

sought, it becomes clear that the requested information does not fall within the scope of

personal information as defined under the relevant legal framework.

Specifically, the disclosure of a name or the identity of an institution to which the Petitioner

has directed payments from public funds does not, in itself, constitute an unwarranted

invasion of privacy of such third party. Such information relates directly to the use of public

resources, which is inherently subject to public scrutiny. Public institutions operate under the

principle of accountability, and their expenditures should be transparent to ensure that they

Page 8 of 9

adhere to legal, ethical, and financial standards. Consequently, the disclosure of such

information should not be withheld unless there is a compelling reason to demonstrate that

doing so would harm an individual's right to privacy in a manner that outweighs the public

interest and transparency.

Furthermore, the financial dealings of a public institutionparticularly those involving

payments made from public fundscannot be categorized as confidential or exempt from

disclosure. Any claim that such information is undisclosable must be weighed against the

fundamental principle that public funds must be managed openly and responsibly. Such open

disclosure would serve to enhance trust in public institutions by allowing for oversight and

accountability, ensuring that no illegal, undisclosable, or unaccountable expenditures occur.

The mere fact that the information in question may reveal the names of third parties involved

in transactions with a public institution does not, on its own, provide sufficient justification

for withholding it. Such names are relevant insofar as they pertain to activities conducted

using public funds, and their disclosure is crucial to maintaining transparency in public

administration. Unless the disclosure can be shown to result in an unwarranted invasion of

privacybeyond the reasonable expectation of privacy in the context of public

expenditurethere is no legal or ethical basis for preventing access to this information.

In conclusion, while the protection of personal information is a legitimate concern, it must be

balanced against the public's right to access information about the use of public funds. The

disclosure of the requested information does not violate privacy rights in an unwarranted

manner and aligns with the broader objectives of transparency, accountability, and good

governance.

Therefore, providing the information requested does not constitute a violation of Article 14A

(2) or 28(e) of the Constitution. Providing the information requested does not harm the rights

of third parties, as the requested information does not infringe upon any individual's privacy,

reputation, or other protected rights. The Right to Information (RTI) Act makes it compulsory

for the disclosure of information unless it explicitly falls under exceptions that would harm

the rights of others. In this case, after a careful review of the nature of the requested

information, it is evident that it does not contain personal or confidential details about third

parties that would undermine their privacy or reputational interests. The information pertains

Page 9 of 9

to public administrative matters, and there is no indication that its disclosure would lead to

any harm or breach of privacy of individuals who are not directly involved in the subject

matter of the request.

The Buddhist Society of the Anuradhapura Regional Branch of the Peoples Bank is a part of

the relevant public authority itself and is not a separate independent entity. Therefore,

according to the section 3(1) of the RTI Act every citizen shall have a right of access to

information which is in the possession, custody or control of a public authority. This

provision ensures that any information held by any body or entity that forms part of a public

authority, including subsidiaries or internal divisions, is subject to the same transparency and

accountability standards as any other records maintained by the parent organization.

Just as every co-owner of a land has ownership over every square inch of that land, any

amount of money spent by a public authority must be accountable and made available for

scrutiny when inquired by a member of the public who is interested unless it is withheld for

cogent and cohesive reasons. Moreover, such actions must be conducted with transparency.

According to the above analysis, I see no valid reason to refuse such information being

released. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Right to Information Commission and

dismiss this appeal with costs awarded to the Applicant-Respondent payable by the Public

Authority- Appellant in an amount of Rs. 100,000.
