In the case of Ridge v. Baldwin [(1963) 2A.E.R. 661 Lord Hodson referred (at page 114) to the three features of natural justice which stand out are; 1) the right to be heard by an unbiased, 2) the right to have notice of charges of misconduct, 3) the right to be heard in answer to those charges, all of which have been denied to the Petitioner at this inquiry.",
