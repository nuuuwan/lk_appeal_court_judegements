JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named 1st Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted along with 2nd Appellant and 3rd Accused by the

Attorney General for committing the offences as mentioned below.

1. On or about the 27th of October 2003 the accused committed the

murder of Bandula Abeywardena alias Chamilt at Uddagandara which

is an offence punishable under Section 296 read with Section 32 of the

Penal Code.

2. In the course of the same transaction the accused had inflicted the

grievous hurt to Achala Sanath Abeywardena punishable under

Section 317 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Hambantota as the

Appellants and other accused opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had

led 03 witnesses and marked production P1-05 and closed the case. The

Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that evidence presented by the

prosecution warranted a case to answer, called for the defence and explained

the rights of the accused. The 1st and 2nd Appellants and the 3rd Accused had

made dock statements and closed their case.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the 1st Appellant on first and sentenced him to

death on 22/09/2022. For the second count he was sentenced to 06 years

CA/HCC/172-173/22

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

and 2nd Appellant had preferred this appeal to this court.

While the Appel was pending, the 2nd Appellant had withdrawn his appeal

on 10.05.2023. Hence, his appeal was stand dismissed. Now this appeal is

only considered in respect of the 1st Appellant and hereinafter he will be

referred to as the Appellant.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to PW3, who 15 years at the time of the incident, his second sister

had a love affair with the Appellant for which the deceased vehemently

opposed. On the previous day of the incident, at about 7.30pm while the

witness watching TV had seen the Appellant and 3rd Accused running away

from their backyard. On the following day morning when he was going to the

school, had met the Appellant and the 3rd Accused on the road. When he

inquired from them why they had come to their house on the previous night,

the Appellant and the 3rd Accused denied the allegation. As such, PW3 had

slapped both of them at that time.

On the same day when this witness was standing near the school, at about

11.15 am the 2nd Appellant had come there and asked why he had hit the

Appellant and the 3rd Accused. The 2nd Appellant had threatened that he

would bring his friends and assault him for not wearing school uniform.

On the same night, at around 7.00 pm when PW3 was playing carrom with

his friends in a shop which belongs to PW1, heard the shouting of the

deceased. When he ran there and tried to reach the deceased, the 2nd

Appellant and the 3rd Accused held him and the Appellant had stabbed him

on his abdomen with a knife. Immediately after stabbing, the Appellant had

CA/HCC/172-173/22

5

stabbed the deceased twice before he ran away from the scene of crime. The

other two also ran away from the scene. PW1 had taken deceased and PW3

to the hospital immediately. PW3 had given his statement to police while

receiving treatment in the hospital.

PW1, Keerthiratna was the owner of the shop close to which the incident had

happened. On the date of incident while he was playing carom with PW3,

heard the deceased shouting that he did not scold them in the morning, it

was his son had scolded them. This incident had happened about 50 meters

away from his shop. As the area is properly with the light emanating from

the houses situated close by, he could witness the incident properly. When

he ran to the spot had seen the Appellant fighting with PW3 and assaulting

the deceased. At that time when PW3 went aside holding his stomach, the

Appellant had stabbed the deceased with a knife and ran away from the

scene. Although PW1 had chased the deceased, but could not apprehend

him. He had seen the 2nd Appellant and the 3rd Accused were sanding little

distance away from the scene. He had taken the both injured to the hospital,

but the deceased was pronounced dead on admission.

PW11, ASP Dissanayake had conducted the investigation, arrested the

Appellant, and recovered a knife upon his statement to the police. The handle

of the knife recovered was a part of a 4-inch-long deer antler. The blade is

about 4 inch long. There was stain on the knife blade.

PW14, JMO Dharmasena who held the post mortem of the deceased had

noted two stab injuries on the deceased body. The 1st injury is categorized

as a serious fatal injury because it penetrated the diaphragm, spleen and

stomach and caused heavy bleeding. The 2nd injury is categorized a non-life-

threatening injury. According to the JMO the death was caused due to

haemorrhage following the stab wound to vital organs of the body.

PW13, JMO Nanayakkara who examined PW3, stated in his MLR that injury

caused to the left side of the abdomen area is a grievous injury.

The Appellant making a statement from the dock denied that charges levelled

against him. He claims that an incident happened between him the deceased

and PW3 in the morning of the date of incident.

The Appellant had raised following grounds of appeal.

1. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

special exceptions in the light of sudden fight with sudden provocation.

2. Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

cumulative provocation.

3. The evidence led at the trial does not support the conviction of murder.

It is trite law that the burden of proof is on the prosecution in all criminal

cases.

In The Queen v. K.A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the

evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden

is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to

give evidence and explain the circumstances.

In this case, the case is rest on direct and circumstantial evidence.

In the first ground of appeal the Counsel for the Appellant contends that the

Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the special exceptions in

the light of sudden fight and sudden provocation.

Exception 1 to Section 294 of the Penal Code reads as follows:

Couplable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the

power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, cause the death

of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other

person by mistake or accident.

CA/HCC/172-173/22

7

Further, the Explanation under this exception reads as:

Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the

offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.

For an accused to succeed a plea of provocation there are several factors

that has to be proved on a balance of probability. First there has to be a

provocation that had taken place. However, each and every instance of

provocation would not be being a situation within the parameters of this

exception. Such provocation needs to be grave and sudden. In addition to

the existence of such provocation, the accused should have been deprived of

the power of self-control due to such provocation.

In Attorney General v John Perera 54 NLR 265 the court held that:

In order to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter the offender

must show first that he was deprived of self-control and secondly that

deprivation was cause by provocation which in the opinion of the jury

was both grave and sudden.

In Attorney General v K.D.J.Perera 54 NLR 265 the court held that:

that the provocation must be such as to bring it with the category

termed sudden, that is to say, that there should be a close proximation

in time between the acts of provocation and of retaliation-which is a

question of fact. This element is of importance in reaching a decision as

to whether the time that elapsed between the giving of provocation and

the committing of the retaliatory act was such as to have afforded and

did in fact afford the assailant an opportunity of regaining his normal

composure, in other words, whether had been a cooling of his temper.

CA/HCC/172-173/22

The evidence led at the trial clearly proves the intention of the Appellant at

the time of killing. There were two separate incidents had happened on the

day of the incident in question. At the time of the incident, according to the

evidence led, does not show provocative behaviour of PW3 or the deceased

when they were approaching the place of incident.

The Appellant had failed to take up the position that the deceased or PW3

provoked him and he lost his self-control due to such provocation. Even if

the initial incident -the scuffle between PW3 and the Appellant-is taken as

an act of provocation, there was a cooling off period between the said incident

and the act of stabbing with the knife.

The Learned Additional Solicitor General very correctly contended that if the

incident of slapping in the morning is considered as the act of provocation,

it was done by PW3 and not by the deceased and the explanation says that

whether it is grave and sudden enough depends on the facts of the case. PW3

had slapped him twice because the Appellant had lied that he didnt visit

PW3s house the night before. The Learned ASG further contended that

merely slapping a person twice with the hand doesnt provoke a reasonable

man to commit murder. Hence, he submitted that the Appellant should not

be entitled to succeed in this exception of grave and sudden provocation.

Exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code states:

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having undue advantage or acted in a

cruel or unusual manner.

Further, the Explanation under this exception reads as:

It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or

commits the firs assault.

CA/HCC/172-173/22

Although the Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Appellant had

acted as a result of a sudden fight when they attacked the deceased. The

evidence transpired that the deceased had been unarmed and had not

harmed the Appellant. Therefore, even if the deceased was the first person to

start the fight, it should not have been a very serious fight which could

provoke an ordinary man to commit murder and cause such fatal injuries

which could cause death in the ordinary cause of nature.

According to the evidence adduced by the prosecution the Appellant was in

possession of a knife when the deceased who was unarmed had gone to the

shop to buy cigarettes. This shows that the deceased was not intended to

engage in a fight with the Appellant. The Appellant, carrying a knife, going

to the shop and engage in fight with the deceased and PW3 clearly

demonstrate his intention to harm unarmed persons.

The Learned ASG further contended that a sudden fight cannot be

premeditated as the word sudden clearly means that there cannot be any

such pre-arrangements. The lapse of time between the initial argument and

the final fight is material for an accused to come within Exception-4, since

the lapse of time may grant the opportunity for an accused to premeditate

for a fight. Such a fight is not spontaneous and therefore cannot be regarded

as one that could be described as sudden. If there is lapse of time between

incidents prior to the final assault, it is quite clear that the heat of passion

upon the quarrel would have subsided and the death on such a instance an

instance would be regarded as murder.

In Velayuthan v Attorney General the court held that:

The counsel for the Appellant contended that the death of the deceased

had occurred due to a sudden fight. But at the trial stage the defence

had not pointed out this position. The prosecution evidence revealed, at

the time of the incidents, that the deceased was unarmed and didnt

CA/HCC/172-173/22

10

cause any injury to the Appellant. But the Appellant had inflicted a fatal

blow to the deceased. The sole eye witness and the medical evidence

support this position.

In Ahmad Sherair A.I.R 193 1936 LAH 513 the court held that:

Where the deceased was unarmed and did not cause any injury to the

Appellant, the Appellant following a sudden quarrel had inflicted fatal

blows to the deceased, it was held, exception of sudden fight did not

apply.

In this case the evidence led by the prosecution revealed that at the time of

stabbing, the deceased was unarmed and went to buy cigarettes from the

boutique owned by PW1. The Appellant sustained no injuries at that time.

Further, the Appellant had inflicted serious injury to PW3 who too was

unarmed and merely went to the spot to save deceased father. Hence, the

Appellant cannot take refuge under the cover of the plea of sudden fight as

enshrined under Exception-4 of the Section 294 of Penal Code.

The Counsel for the Appellant contended that the Learned High Court Judge

erred in law by failing to consider the cumulative provocation.

Cumulative Provocation is an extension to the exception 1 of Section 294 of

the Penal Code. Cumulative Provocation as a special exception to a murder

charge has been discussed in several judgments in our courts.

In Premalal v Attorney General [2000] 2 SLR 403 Kulatilaka,J held that:

Until the judgment of Chief Justice H.N.G Fernando in

Samithamby v Queen (1) (de Krester,J-dissenting) our court

followed a strict view in applying Exception (1) set out in Section

294 of the Penal Code. Our judges following their counterparts in

CA/HCC/172-173/22

11

England interpreted the phrase sudden provocation to mean

that provocation should consist of a single act which occurred

immediately before killing so that there was no time for the anger

to cool and the act must have been such that it would have made

a reasonable man to react in the manner as the accused did. Our

Courts were reluctant to take into consideration any special

circumstances which manifested in the particular offenders

case.

Kulatilaka, J. further held that:

Of late we observe a development in other jurisdictions where

Courts and juries have taken a more pragmatic view of the

mitigatory plea of provocation. In a series of cases in applying the

mitigatory plea of provocation Courts took into consideration the

prior course of relationship between the accused and his victim.

In R.W.M.Nandana Senarathbandara v Attorney General

SC/Appeal/32/2015 decided on 17/07/2020 His Lordship Jayantha

Jayasuriya C.J. has held that:

Jurisprudence referred to above demonstrate that in considering

the plea of grave and sudden provocation an accused is entitled

to rely upon a series of prior events that ultimately led to the

incident at which the death was caused. A court should not

restrict its focus to an isolated incident that resulted in the death,

in considering a plea of grave and sudden provocation. The

aforementioned jurisprudence has widened the scope of this plea

by expanding the limitations recognized in its statutory form.

Thereby, the concept of Continuing or Cumulative provocation

has been recognized as a plea coming within the purview of the

plea of grave and sudden provocation recognized under

CA/HCC/172-173/22

12

Exception-1, section 294 of the Penal Code. Therefore, the

proximity of time between the actus reus of the accused and the

provocative act of the victim should be considered in the context

of the nature and circumstances in each case, in deciding whether

an accused is entitled to the benefit of the plea of Grave and

Sudden Provocation.

Guided by above cited judgments, it is pertinent to consider whether the

benefit of the plea of Grave and Sudden Provocation on the basis of

Cumulative Provocation could be awarded to the Appellant as claimed by

him under this ground of appeal.

According to PW3, the first incident was happened in the morning where he

had slapped the Appellant and the 3rd Accused. Deceased was not involved

in the morning incident. In the evening when the deceased went to buy

cigarettes he was stabbed by the Appellant. The deceased doesnt have a

close relationship with the Appellant. Although the 2nd Appellant had an

affair with the one of the daughters of the deceased, but in no case that

problem can be extended to the Appellant. As such the plea of cumulative

provocation was in any event should not be available to the Appellant.

In this case two eye witnesses had seen the incident. Their evidence not

subjected to major omissions or contradictions. Although they were under

lengthy cross examination the defence could not raise any serious doubt on

the evidence given by prosecution witnesses.

As discussed under the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence against the

Appellant. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analyzed all the

evidence presented by both parties and come to the conclusion as to why he

accepting the prosecution version and rejecting the defence version.

As the Learned High Court Judge had rightly convicted the Appellant for the

charges levelled against him in the indictment, I affirm the conviction and

dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Embilipitiya along with the original case record.
