JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted in the High Court of Colombo under Section 296 of

the Penal Code for committing the murder of Sathasivam Sri Priya on or

about 31st July 2015.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Colombo as the

Appellant had opted for a non-jury trial. After the conclusion of the

prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the defence

and the Appellant had made a dock statement. After considering the evidence

presented by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the

Appellant as charged and sentenced him to death on 06/09/2022.

CA/HCC/0162/22

3 | P a g e

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in his absence. Also, at

the time of argument the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from

prison.

Background of the Case.

According to PW1, Sathyasri is the daughter of the deceased. She was around

7 years old when she witnessed the gruesome incident. On the date of

incident, in the morning PW1 and her deceased mother had gone to a nearby

Hindu temple to engage in religious activities. After completing such

activities, both had gone to a nearby hotel to have something to eat. After

having food, they had returned home, gone upstairs, and relaxed by playing

video games. PW1 had then left the house to play with neighboring children.

As she was leaving the house she had seen PW3, a person who was boarding

in the deceaseds house sleeping on the floor. When PW1 went out a neighbor

had called her to bring a jug to take some Payasam which is a desert

prepared in Tamil homes. When she returned home to get a jug, she had

noticed that the door of the house was open and that the Appellant was

standing on the staircase calling the deceased to come downstairs. When the

deceased obliged and came down, the Appellant had slapped the deceased

and making the deceased to fall on the ground. The Appellant had then gone

out of the house, brought a knife and had dealt several blows on the legs,

hands, abdomen and chest of the deceased mercilessly. The deceased called

her mother three times before going silent. The Appellant had then kept his

hand near the nose of the deceased and checked whether the deceased was

breathing. Although PW1 hid behind a curtain near the sink of the house

out of fear, she could see the entire episode very clearly. Then PW1 had

managed to run to the nearby boutique and informed the incident to her

grandmother PW2. When she came back with PW2, they had seen the

CA/HCC/0162/22

4 | P a g e

deceased lying on the ground in a pool of blood. When PW1 ran out, she had

seen the Appellant running out of the deceaseds house.

PW2, Krishnaveni had taken the deceased to the Colombo General Hospital

with the assistance of the neighbors and the police but the deceased had

succumbed to her injuries around 6.00pm. PW3, Bairavi had also witnessed

the Appellant stabbing the deceased using a knife.

The Appellant had surrendered to police on 02.08.2015 through a lawyer. A

blood-stained knife was recovered upon the statement of the Appellant. The

recovery of the knife was witnessed by a person called Ariyaratne. The

deceased had suffered 20 stab injuries and 19 cut injuries on the upper and

lower limbs and the chest. According to PW10, the JMO the death was

caused due to multiple stab injuries to the chest and abdomen.

Being satisfied that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against

the Appellant, the Learned Trial Judge had called for the defence. The

Appellant had made a statement from the dock and closed his case. The

learned High Court Judge had sentenced the Appellant to death on

06/09/2022.

The Appellant had filed the following grounds of appeal.

1. The learned trial Judge has failed to properly analyze the

contradiction of whether PW1 was observing the murder incident

while she was staying under the sink or while standing away from

the sink.

2. The learned trial Judge has failed to analyze that the crucial parts of

PW1s testimony are not independent and ex mero motu given

evidence as the same have been suggested by the prosecution

unnecessarily.

3. The learned trial judge has erroneously analyzed that it has been

proven that there was a dispute as the deceased had made a tip off/

CA/HCC/0162/22

5 | P a g e

information against a family member of the Appellant which had

ultimately resulted as a motive for this offence committed.

4. The learned trial Judge has failed to analyze that all the witnesses

have failed to identify the knife that was marked as P1 and it is not

correct to mark the same via PW1 since she had stated she was

unable to witness the same properly at the time of the incident.

Considering the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant, it is apparent

that grounds are inter related to each other. Hence, I decided to consider all

the grounds jointly hereinafter.

In this case PW1 was 07 years old when he witnessed the gruesome incident.

When he gave evidence in the High Court, he was 10 years old.

In Ranjeet Kumar Ram v. State of Bihar [2015] SCC Online SC 500 the

court held that:

Evidence of the child witness and its credibility would depend upon the

circumstances of each case. Only precaution which the court has to bear

in mind while assessing the evidence of a child witness is that the

witness must be a reliable one.

In this case PW1 and PW3 are eye witnesses. Hence, admissibility of the

evidence of an eye witness needs to be discussed very clearly.

Eyewitness testimony is one of the most important kinds of criminal

evidence. In criminal cases, the judges regularly face the difficult but crucial

task of evaluating eyewitness testimony. This sometimes means checking

whether the witnesss story fits with other established facts of the case.

However, the veracity of such a story cannot always be verified or falsified

directly. In such cases judges will have to look at whether the statement

comes from a reliable source.

CA/HCC/0162/22

6 | P a g e

Further, an eyewitnesss testimony is probably the most persuasive form of

evidence presented in court, but in many cases, its accuracy is dubious.

There is also precedent that erroneous eyewitness evidence can lead to

wrongful convictions sending people to prison for years or decades, even to

death row, for crimes they did not commit.

When considering the evidence of an eye witness, the Court should look at

the demeanour of the witness, the inherent probability of the account, any

internal inconsistencies in the account, whether the account is consistent

with previous statements by the witness, whether the witness has any bias

against the accused or any family or group to which the accused belongs,

whether the evidence at the crime scene supports the account, and whether

the witnesss testimony is supported by the testimony of other witnesses.

These factors are very important as the burden of proof is on the prosecution

in all criminal cases.

In The Queen v K.A. Santin Sangho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the evidence

the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden is the same.

This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to give evidence and

explain the circumstances.

The credibility of the witness does not stand impeached merely by proving

contradictions on record. It is required for the defence side to show that

prosecution witnesses may deliberately depose change or improve their

original statement in order to cause prejudice to the accused. Similarly,

minor omission or discrepancy in evidence is not enough to hold the accused

not guilty.

CA/HCC/0162/22

The learned High Court Judge had very extensively analysed the evidence of

PW1 and PW3 and considered the contradictions and omission and decided

to accept their evidence as true in this case. The relevant portion of the

judgment is re-produced below:

Although motive is not necessary to be proved in a criminal trial, existence

of a motive would strengthen the prosecution case. In this case the evidence

revealed that the deceased had given information about a drug business

carried out by a family member of the Appellant. This was revealed from the

evidence of PW1 and PW2.

The defence had marked contradictions and omissions on the evidence of

PW1. As those contradictions are not forceful enough to create a doubt on

the prosecution case, the rejection of those contradictions has not caused

any prejudice to the Appellants. Further, none of the witnesses are expected

give 100% accurate evidence in a trial.

CA/HCC/0162/22

9 | P a g e

In State of Uttar Pradesh v. M. K. Anthony [AIR 1985 SC 48] the court held

that:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must

be whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears

to have a ring of truth. Once that impression is formed, it is

undoubtedly necessary for the court to scrutinise the evidence

more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, draw-backs

and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and

evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of the evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier

evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of

belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core

of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn

out of context here or there from the evidence, attaching

importance to some technical error committed by the investigating

officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily

permit rejection of the evidence as a whole. Even honest and

truthful witnesses may differ in some details unrelated to the

main incident because power of observation, retention and

reproduction differ with individuals. Cross examination is an

unequal duel between a rustic and refined lawyer.

Further the evidence given by PW1 and PW3 is well corroborated by each

other regarding inflicting injuries to the deceased. Both had seen the

Appellant dealing a number of blows with a knife before he left the place.

PW1 went on to further say that the Appellant had kept his hand close to her

mothers nose to ensure whether the deceased was breathing. The injuries

sustained by the deceased and the conduct of the Appellant had clearly

CA/HCC/0162/22

10 | P a g e

established that the Appellant had only intended to kill the deceased as she

was an obstacle for their smooth running of drug business.

The evidence given by the lay witnesses had very well tallied with the medical

evidence pertaining to the injuries inflicted on the deceased.

The learned High Court Judge had considered and analyzed the evidence

accurately even though he did not have the advantage of seeing the

demeanour and deportment of the eye witnesses.

As the prosecution had presented overwhelming evidence against the

Appellant, it is not correct to say that the prosecution had not proved the

case against the Appellant beyond reasonable grounds.

In this case a knife had been recovered upon the statement of the Appellant

under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

Ordinarily, a statement made by an accused person is inadmissible against

him. As exception to this rule is the admissibility of statement under Section

27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance where a portion of a statement made to a

police officer and which leads to the discovery of a fact can be led in evidence.

In this case, after receiving information a team of police officers had

conducted investigations, arrested the Appellant, and recovered a knife

based upon his statement under Section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance.

PW1 in her evidence stated that the Appellant used a similar knife to inflict

injuries to her mother.

Upon recovery of the knife, it was sent to the Government Analyst for DNA

testing. According to PW11, the Government Analyst, deceaseds blood had

been identified on the knife which had been marked as P1 in the trial.

Given the reasons above, I conclude that leading investigation evidence and

marking recovery done under Section 27(1) of Evidence Ordinance through

CA/HCC/0162/22

11 | P a g e

PW1 is not improper and has not occasioned any prejudice to the Appellant

in this case.

The prosecution had led firm evidence that the Appellant had come there

armed with a knife. This evidence was not contradicted in the trial. Even

though PW1 was not certain about the identity of the knife, it is not capable

of creating a doubt on the overwhelming evidence presented by the

prosecution. Hence acceptance of prosecution evidence has not occasioned

a failure of justice in this case.

The single most important criterion in evaluating the fairness of a trial is the

observance of the principle of equality of arms between the defence and the

prosecution. Equality of arms, which must be observed throughout the trial,

means that both parties are treated in a manner ensuring their procedurally

equal position during the course of the trial.

In this case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence

presented by both parties to arrive at his decision. He has properly analyzed

the evidence given by both sides in his judgment. As the evidence adduced

by the Appellant failed to create a doubt over the prosecution case, the

conclusion reached by the learned High Court Judge in this case cannot be

faulted. Therefore, I reject the grounds of appeal urged by the Appellant in

this case.

As discussed under the grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellant, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating evidence against the

Appellant. The learned High Court Judge had accurately analyzed all the

evidence presented by all the parties and come to a precise finding that the

Appellant is guilty of committing the murder of the deceased in this case.

CA/HCC/0162/22

Therefore, I affirm the conviction and dismiss the Appeal of the Appellant.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgement to the High Court of

Colombo along with the original case record.
