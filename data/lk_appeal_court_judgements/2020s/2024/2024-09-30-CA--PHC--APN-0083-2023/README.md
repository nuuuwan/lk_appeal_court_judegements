Decided on : 30-09-2024

Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

petitioner) invoking the revisionary jurisdiction granted to this Court by Article

138 of The Constitution.

The petitioner is seeking to challenge the order dated 06-07-2023 made by the

learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province

Holden in Colombo, where the revision application filed by him against the orders

made by the learned Magistrate of the Magistrates Court of Colombo Fort on 07-

06-2023 and 21-06-2023 was refused without notice being issued to the relevant

respondents named in the application.

Page 7 of 19

The said revision application has been made before the Provincial High Court of

the Western Province Holden in Colombo urging the Court to exercise the

revisionary jurisdiction granted to it in terms of Article 154P of the Constitution.

When this matter was supported for notice, this Court decided to issue notice

after having considered the relevant facts, circumstances, and the law urged by

the petitioner.

Accordingly, the named respondent-respondents, including the Hon. Attorney

General was allowed to file objections to the application. At the hearing of the

application, this Court heard the submissions of the learned Presidents Counsel

who represented the petitioner, as well as that of the learned State Counsel who

represented the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and the 4th respondent-respondents.

This is an issue that revolves around the matters arising out of the B-report No.

B25774-23 filed before the Magistrates Court of Colombo Fort by the 1st

respondent-respondent, the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department

(CID).

In the above mentioned B-report, the said Director of the CID has reported facts

to the Court in terms of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

(ICCPR) Act No-56 of 2007 and also in terms of sections 120, 291(a), 291(b) of

the Penal Code and section 6 of the Computer Crimes Act No. 24 of 2007,

informing the Court that the 1st suspect-respondent has made statements that

are defamatory and hateful in order to disturb religious harmony, and thereby

committed offences punishable in terms of the above Acts.

Based on the above information filed before the Court, the 1st suspect-

respondent and the 2nd suspect-respondent have been arrested and produced

before the Magistrates Court of Colombo Fort on 28-05-2023 and remanded.

Both of them have been later released on bail on 06-07-2023.

Page 8 of 19

When this matter was taken up for consideration before this Court, it was

intimated to the Court by the learned State Counsel who represented the 1st to

4th respondent-respondents that after the completion of the inquiry against the

1st and 2nd suspect-respondents, they have been now discharged from the

proceedings of the Magistrates Court as it has been decided to not prosecute

them for the alleged offences mentioned in the B-report.

However, the learned Presidents Counsel who represented the petitioner of this

matter urged the Court to consider the application before the Court and

pronounce a judgment as required, since the orders made by the learned

Magistrate of Colombo Fort, sought to be challenged in this revision application

are still in force.

The facts placed before this Court reveals that when the matter where the 1st

and 2nd suspect-respondents were produced before the Magistrates Court from

remand custody on 07-06-2023 was mentioned, the CID has informed the Court

that the investigations have not been concluded, while the learned Presidents

Counsel who represented the suspects sought bail for them.

At that juncture, submissions have been made by another Counsel on the basis

that he is representing the party aggrieved. Yet another Counsel has appeared

before the Court informing that he is representing a person from an organization

called Sinhala Rawaya, and has informed the Court that after the two suspects

in relation to the case were remanded, a person called Widarshana Kannangara

has conducted a press briefing and had conducted a media circus by making

comments, criticizing the remanding of the two suspects which amounts to

contempt of Court. Making extensive submissions in that regard and by filing a

video recording of the alleged press conference, he has stated that several others

had also participated in the said press conference and that he can also produce

photographs. He has urged the Court to conduct an investigation in that regard.

Page 9 of 19

The learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort has made the impugned 1st order on 07-

06-2023 in relation to the application for bail, and also in relation to the

application made by the Attorney-at-Law who represented the earlier mentioned

organization.

The application before this Court by the petitioner relates to the order made by

the learned Magistrate in relation to the alleged contempt of Court.

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the relevant part of the order made

by the learned Magistrate, which reads thus;

.

, , , ,

.

.

.

.

Consequent to this order, on 21-06-2023, the learned Magistrate has made

another order, which appears to be a one relating to the earlier mentioned order

regarding the complaint of contempt of Court.

The said order reads as follows;

,

2023/6/9 CID

.

/:

Page 10 of 19

The petitioner being one of the persons named by the learned Magistrate in his

order dated 07-06-2023 has filed the impugned revision application before the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo under the High

Court Revision Case No. HCRA 75-2023 in terms of Article 154P of The

Constitution. In his application before the High Court, the petitioner has taken

up several grounds which he has referred to as exceptional grounds available for

him in order to challenge and seek to set aside the orders made by the learned

Magistrate of Colombo Fort.

He has urged that the learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort had no jurisdiction in

terms of section 55(1) of the Judicature Act to take cognizance of the alleged

contempt of Court matter which has occurred outside of his jurisdiction and

presence, and therefore, had no jurisdiction to order an investigation in that

regard.

It has been urged that if at all, for an alleged contempt of Court of this nature, it

is only the Court of Appeal that has jurisdiction in terms of Article 105(3) of The

Constitution.

Another ground that had been taken up was that the alleged press conference

had been held within the Maradana police area, and therefore, was within the

jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court of Maligakanda, and the learned Magistrate

had no jurisdiction to order the CID or the Computer Crimes Investigation

Division of the police to conduct investigations in that regard.

It has also been argued that without a proper complaint or application in terms

of section 136(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the Magistrate had no

jurisdiction to entertain a mere statement made by an Attorney-at-Law in Court,

in the manner it was done, and therefore, basic principles of law have been

ignored and violated.

Page 11 of 19

Urging the above matters as exceptional circumstances available to him, the

petitioner has urged the High Court to issue notice in relation to his revision

application, and also for stay orders in relation to the orders made on 07-06-

2023 and 21-06-2023 by the learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort.

The learned High Court Judge, after having listened to the submissions of the

learned Presidents Counsel who represented the petitioner, has pronounced a

considered order on 06-07-2023, where the learned High Court Judge has

refused to issue notice on the basis that the petitioner has failed to establish any

matter that shocks the conscience of the Court, which amounts to a positive

miscarriage of justice.

Although the order made was in relation to the issuing of the notice to the

respondents, it appears that the learned High Court Judge has considered each

of the matters urged by the petitioner in his petition in detail, before deciding to

refuse notice.

In his application before this Court, the petitioner submitted the following

grounds, which he termed as exceptional grounds available to him, in order to

challenge the order made by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High

Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo, as well as the relevant two

orders made by the learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort.

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the said exceptional grounds urged.

(a) The learned High Court Judge has erroneously held that the petitioners

name is not mentioned in the order of the learned Magistrate and failed

to notice that the name of the petitioner is in fact contained in the order

dated 07-06-2023 in the Magistrates Court case record which was filed

along with the Revision Application No. HCRA-75-2023 marked as X1.

Page 12 of 19

(b) The learned High Court Judge has erred in law by concluding after

analyzing section 9(b)(i), that the Fort Magistrate has the power to order

an investigation regarding the alleged offence. The Hon. Magistrate has

no jurisdiction under section 55(1) of the Judicature Act No. 02 of 1978

to take cognizance of the alleged contempt of Court committed outside

of the Magistrates Court.

(c) Without prejudice to the above, since the impugned press conference

took place in the Maradana police area within the jurisdiction of the

Maligakanda Magistrates Court, the Magistrates Court of Colombo

Fort has no territorial jurisdiction in view of section 9(b)(i) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act.

(d) The learned High Court Judge has erred in law by failing to consider

that exceptional circumstances are not required in the circumstances

of this case as there is no right to appeal from the impugned order of

the learned Magistrate.

It is settled law that revision being a discretionary remedy, such a remedy can

only be granted under exceptional circumstances. What can be constituted as

exceptional circumstances had been defined by our Superior Courts in several

consistent judgments pronounced in that regard.

I would like to quote from the case of Sadi Banda Vs. Officer In Charge of

Norton Bridge Police Station (supra) which I find relevant in the above context.

The revisionary power of Court is a discretionary power. This is an

extraordinary jurisdiction which is exercised by the Court and the grant of

relief is entirely dependent of the Court. The grant of such relief is of course

a matter entirely in the discretion of the Court, and always be dependent on

the circumstances of each case. Existence of exceptional circumstances is

the process by which the extraordinary power of revision should be adopted.

The exceptional circumstances would vary from case to case and their

degree of exceptionality must be correctly assessed and gauged by the Court

Page 13 of 19

taking into consideration all antecedent circumstances using the yardstick

whether a failure of justice would occur unless revisionary powers are

invoked.

It was held in the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Mercantile Hotels

Management Ltd (1987) 1 SLR 5 that,

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

In the case of Wijesinghe Vs. Thamararatnam (Sriskantha Law Report

Volume IV page 47) it was stated that;

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available unless the

application discloses circumstances which shocks the conscience of the Court.

In the case of Vanik Incorporation Ltd Vs. Jayasekare (1997) 2 SLR 365, it

was observed,

Revisionary powers should be exercised where a miscarriage of justice has

occasioned due to a fundamental rule of procedure being violated, but only

when a strong case is made out amounting to a positive miscarriage of justice.

Making submissions before this Court, the learned Presidents Counsel

contended that the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Colombo has failed to appreciate the relevant legal

provisions when notice was refused in relation to the revision application filed

by the petitioner.

Referring to the two orders made by the learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort, it

was submitted that there was no basis for the learned Magistrate to act on a

mere statement made by an Attorney-at-Law representing a party who was not

a party to a case.

Page 14 of 19

It was submitted that the learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction under the

contempt of Court provisions or the territorial jurisdiction to determine on the

alleged statement made by the Attorney-at-Law on 07-06-2023 when the

impugned order was made.

The learned Presidents Counsel also referred to the fact that in the order, the

learned Magistrate has named several persons including the petitioner ordering

the CID to conduct investigations in relation to the alleged contempt of Court,

whereas, in the statement made before the open Court, the Attorney-at-Law has

referred to only one person. He was of the view that the learned Magistrate may

have acted on some prior knowledge when he made this order, which, according

to him, was not an order the learned Magistrate had jurisdiction to make.

The facts submitted to this Court reveal that the impugned order dated 07-06-

2023 in relation to the alleged contempt of Court has been based on a press

conference held in Maradana area. This goes on to show that the alleged incident

had occurred not in the presence of the Court or committed in the course of any

act or proceeding of the said Court.

As correctly pointed out by the learned Presidents Counsel, if any contempt has

been committed by the persons mentioned in the order of the learned Magistrate,

the relevant provision under which the Magistrates Court can take cognizance

of such contempt of Court is section 55(1) of the Judicature Act of No. 02 of 1978

as amended by the Amendment Act No. 16 of 1989.

The relevant section 55(1) reads as follows.

55(1). Every District Court, Small Claims Court and Magistrates

Court shall for the purpose of maintaining its proper authority and

efficiency, have a special jurisdiction to take cognizance and to

punish with the penalties in that behalf as hereinafter provided, every

Page 15 of 19

offence of contempt of court committed in the presence of the Court

itself and all offences which are committed in the course of any act

or proceeding in the said Court respectively, and which are declared

by any law for the time being in force to be punishable as contempt

of court.

As I have considered before, the alleged contempt of Court is not something that

has been committed in the presence of the Court nor in the course of any act or

proceedings in the said Court. Therefore, the only provision under which an

action can be brought, if such contempt had been committed in the course of

the alleged press conference, would be by filing an action before the Court of

Appeal in terms of Article 105(3) of The Constitution.

In my view, that is a matter for the party who claims that such contempt of Court

occurred, and not for the learned Magistrate, unless he is the person who is

taking the initiative to file contempt proceedings before the Court of Appeal.

It is also the view of this Court that the statement made before the learned

Magistrate by an Attorney-at-Law has been in relation to a specific press

conference, which has already been concluded by that time. It has been stated

that he is producing a compact disc with the relevant video and some

photographs to the Court, which means that there was nothing to investigate

further on to the matter, but only a matter of commencing contempt of Court

proceedings in the correct forum.

Under the circumstances, I do not find any basis for the learned Magistrate to

order the CID to conduct an extensive investigation in relation to the alleged

contempt of Court and also to refer the matter to the Director of Computer

Crimes Investigation Division by his order dated 21-07-2023.

I find that the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Colombo was misguided when the learned High

Court Judge considered only the journal entry made by the learned Magistrate

Page 16 of 19

to determine that there is no order to conduct an investigation against the

petitioner.

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when section

30 of the Judicature Act and section 9(b)(i) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

were considered when issuing of notice to the respondents mentioned in the

application before the High Court was refused.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the provisions of

section 55(1) of the Judicature Act, which is the provision as to contempt of

Court proceedings before a Magistrates Court, in its correct perspective.

Section 30 of the Judicature Act provides the forum jurisdiction for a Magistrate

to perform and exercise all powers and duties, which a Magistrate is empowered

to exercise and perform by virtue of the provisions of the Penal Code or of the

law relating to criminal procedure or any other enactment for the time being in

force.

However, it needs to be noted that the Judicature Act in itself has provided for a

specific provision in relation to the matters of contempt of Court under section

55(1) of the Act. In such a scenario, I find that it is only in terms of section 55(1),

a Magistrate can gain jurisdiction in relation to matters of contempt of Court.

It is the view of this Court that the learned High Court Judge has applied section

9(b)(i) to justify the actions of the learned Magistrate without any acceptable

basis.

The relevant section 9(b)(i) reads as follows.

9(b). Jurisdiction -

(i) To inquire into all offences committed or alleged to have

been committed wholly or in part within its local

jurisdiction or in relation to which jurisdiction is by this

Page 17 of 19

Code given to such court to inquire into, to summon and

examine all witnesses touching such offences, and to

issue warrants and other processes to apprehend and

summon all criminals and offenders and deal with them

according to law;

There cannot be any argument as to the jurisdiction a Magistrate will have as

provided for by the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and other

applicable statutes. However, it needs to be noted that for the purposes of

administration of justice, Sri Lanka has been divided into Judicial Zones,

Judicial Districts and Judicial Divisions. It is undoubted that the Magistrates

Court of Colombo Fort comes within the Judicial Division of Colombo, but has

been assigned to perform functions of a Magistrate in relation to a particular

area within the said Judicial Division.

It is an admitted fact that the alleged press conference has taken place in

Maradana area, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Magistrates Court of

Maligakanda.

Therefore, it is clear that the learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort had no

jurisdiction to order an investigation or inquiry as it was ordered, in relation to

an alleged offence that has been admittedly committed within an area of another

Magistrates Courts jurisdiction. Even if an information is provided to the

learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort in relation to an offence, the directive would

have been to report facts before the relevant Magistrate under whose jurisdiction

the offence has been committed and obtain orders from that Magistrates Court.

I am of the view that the learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort was acting without

jurisdiction when the relevant orders were made to the CID and to the Computer

Crimes Investigation Division to conduct a thorough investigation.

Page 18 of 19

For completeness of this judgment, I would like to cite the Supreme Court

judgment in Regent International Hotels Ltd Vs. Siril Gardiner and Others

(1978-79-80) 1 SLR 278 which held:

1. That the Court of Appeal has all the powers under Article 105(3) of The

Constitution of punishing for contempt whether committed in facie

curiae or ex facie curiae.

2. That the jurisdiction of an inferior Court to punish or for contempt in

confined to punishment for contempt as are perpetrated in facie curiae

and does not extend to those committed out of Court unless express

statutory power is given for that purpose.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the petitioner has

adduced sufficient exceptional circumstances for this Court to intervene into the

order dated 06-07-2023 made by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial

High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo and the relevant part of

the order made by the learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort, which I have referred

previously in this judgment, in relation to the petitioner and several others on

the basis that they should be investigated over contempt of Court. Also the order

made on 21-06-2023 where a directive has been made to the Director of the

Computer Crimes Investigation Division, as none of the said orders can be

allowed to stand.

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 06-07-2023 of the learned High Court

Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo,

and also set aside the relevant part of the order made by the learned Magistrate

of Colombo Fort on 07-06-2023 and the relevant part of the order made by the

learned Magistrate of Colombo Fort on 21-06-2023.

Page 19 of 19

Accordingly, the revision application is allowed.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo, and also to

the Magistrates Court of Colombo Fort for necessary information and

compliance.
