Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) on being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence by the

learned High Court Judge of Monaragala.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Monaragala for causing the

death of one Mayalagu Yogeshwari, at a place called Kumaradola within the

jurisdiction of the High Court of Monaragala, on or about 19-06-2012, and

thereby committing the offence of murder, punishable in terms of section 296 of

the Penal Code.

Page 3 of 18

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Monargala, of her

judgment dated 17-01-2018 found the appellant guilty as charged, and

accordingly, he was sentenced to death.

The Facts in Brief

Mayalagu Irulai (PW-01) is the sister of the deceased who was also known as

Nagamma. She has lived some 8 miles away from her house, but used to be a

frequent visitor to her house. During the time relevant to this incident, she had

been working at a hotel in the town. Irulai Kandasami is a person who lived close

to her house and also a close relative, whose son is the appellant in this matter.

She has referred to the appellant as Ganesh and has admitted that her sister

Nagamma used to consume liquor. On the last day her sister visited her house,

namely on 19-06-2012, her sister has scolded Kandasami and his family,

alleging that they got down her son and made him to consume liquor with them.

Due to this reason, there had been a verbal exchange between Kandasami and

her sister, where Kandasami has threatened her with death.

After this incident, the deceased Nagamma has left the house of PW-01 and she

has come to know later that her sister has gone missing. After about 5 days,

Nagammas body has been recovered among the bowlders situated near the place

where she lived. That has been the place where the water supply tank that

supplies water to the area was also situated, and was also the place where the

appellant has worked and lived. Although the body was in a decomposed state

when discovered, PW-01 has identified the body as her sisters.

According to the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who conducted the post-mortem

marked P-02 at the trial, the death has been caused due to ligature

strangulation. He has expressed the opinion that the strangulation may have

been caused by something similar to a wire, and has expressed the opinion that

the wire marked and produced as P-01 could have been used as the instrument

used for the strangulation.

Page 4 of 18

According to the evidence of PW-11 (the police officer who had conducted the

main investigations into the offence), he has reached the place where the body

of the deceased was found on 23-06-2012 after receiving an information in that

regard. He has found the body between two bowlders and it had been in a

decomposed state. The body has been identified by her sister and other relatives.

The investigation officer has come to know that the deceased had gone missing

since the 19th of that month. When he searched the surrounding area, he has

discovered a blue-coloured piece of cloth on a rock which was about 3 meters

away from the body.

Upon further investigations, he has received an information of a suspect named

Pechchamuthu Ganesh alias Kalua, who is the appellant. Accordingly, he went

to the place where he worked, which was situated nearby and had arrested him.

Based on the information provided by him, he has recovered a cable (one end

wrapped with a blue-coloured cloth), among the grass cover near the body of

the deceased. Although he has discovered this cable, since he intended to bring

it to the notice of the Magistrate for the purposes of the inquest, he has let the

said cable to be in the same place until the Magistrate observed it.

Based on the same information provided by the appellant, the investigating

officer has gone to his house and had recovered 4 pieces of triangular shaped

blue-coloured cloth near the cooking stove in the kitchen.

The witness has marked the relevant portion of the statement that led to the

discovery of the cable and the pieces of cloth as P-03 in terms of section 27 of

the Evidence Ordinance. The cable mentioned has been marked as P-01 earlier

in the evidence, and the blue-coloured piece of cloth which was wrapped around

the cable as P-02, and the pieces of cloth found in the kitchen as P-4 and P-5 A,

B, C, D.

Although it has been suggested on behalf of the appellant that the productions

marked through him were not recovered as a result of the statement made by

Page 5 of 18

him to the police, the witness has denied it stating that the productions were

recovered only because of the statement made by the appellant.

PW-07 Thangavelu Pichchamuththu is the father of the appellant. He is the same

person mentioned by PW-01 as Kandasami. He has confirmed that the deceased

Nagamma came to her sisters house who lived near his house and there was an

altercation between the deceased and himself. It had been his position that the

deceased used filthy language towards him after getting drunk, which resulted

in the altercation.

The appellant has come home after going to the town around 8.00 p.m. that day

and has left the house around 9.00 p.m. stating that he is going to attend a party

at the water tank. The water tank mentioned here is the place where the

appellant has worked, and according to the evidence of the father, the appellant

has been living in the premises of the water tank.

The appellant has returned on the following day and has informed his mother

that Nagamma died. The PW-07 has given clear evidence to the effect that after

informing his mother, when questioned, the appellant said the same thing to him

as well. It has been his evidence that although he was informed of the death, he

did not inform it to anyone else, and only after he was arrested and taken to the

police station, he revealed this information to the police.

Under cross-examination, he has stated further that once he and his family

members were taken to the police station, they were assaulted by the police.

Although it has been suggested to him that there was a dispute between him and

his son, he has refuted that, though he has admitted that his son once assaulted

him and he received injuries as a result. To the suggestion that he was lying in

this regard, he has maintained the position that he has no reason to lie against

his own son, other than revealing what he told him about this incident.

The prosecution has also called the Government Analyst as a prosecution

witness. The Government Analyst has testified that the blue-coloured pieces of

Page 6 of 18

cloth produced before him for testing were parts of the same cloth by giving clear

reasoning as to reaching such a conclusion.

Apart from the above witnesses, police officers who assisted the investigations

have given evidence at the trial to substantiate their roles in the investigations.

At the conclusion of the prosecution evidence, the learned trial Judge has

decided to call for a defence of the appellant based on the evidence placed before

the Court. The appellant has decided to make the following statement from the

dock.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. In view of the self-contradictory and inconsistent evidence of the Chief

Investigating Officer, namely Wijesinghe, a serious doubt arises as to

whether the alleged section 27 statement is that of the accused-

appellant named in the indictment.

2. The learned trial Judge has failed to take cognizance of the fact that the

prosecution has woefully failed to establish the chain of custody

(inward journey).

3. The learned trial Judge totally failed to address her judicial mind of the

aforementioned infirmities in relation to section 27 recoveries.

4. The learned trial Judge legally flawed on the principles relating to

section 27 recoveries.

5. Police statement of the main witness, namely PW-07, Thangavelu

Pechchamuthu had been obtained illegally under duress and torture

based on his own admission.

Page 7 of 18

6. Due to the inherent weaknesses and infirmities in the evidence of the

main witness (PW-07), it is unsafe to place reliance on the evidence of

the said witness to form the basis of the conviction.

7. The evidence of PW-07 is wholly contradicted by PW-10 (police

evidence) further creating a doubt in the prosecution case.

8. Evaluation of the dock statement is deficient and legally flawed as the

learned trial Judge has examined the legality and the tenability of the

dock statement in the light of evidence led by the prosecution.

9. The evaluation of the circumstantial evidence on the part of the learned

trial Judge is deficient and flawed.

10. Application of the Ellenborough Principle to the instant case is wholly

unwarranted.

11. In the totality of the aforementioned grounds of appeal, the judgment

of the learned trial Judge is defective and deficient, thereby rendering

the judgment legally and factually wrong.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

The evidence placed before the trial Court in this matter makes it clear that there

had been no eyewitnesses to the incident.

This is a matter where the prosecution has relied on the circumstantial evidence,

the scientific evidence, and the confession that has been allegedly made to the

father of the appellant by him, to prove the prosecution case. It is therefore my

view that before considering whether the grounds of appeal urged have merit,

the relevant law in that regard should be considered.

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz, J.,

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and

inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his innocence.

Page 8 of 18

In the case of Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01, it was

held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the

offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can

be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved beyond

reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence the

only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the

offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing the

offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

However, when considering the circumstantial evidence, what has to be

considered is the totality of the circumstantial evidence before coming to a firm

finding as to the guilt of an accused, although each piece of circumstantial

evidence when taken separately, may only be suspicious in nature.

In the case of King Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145, it was held:

In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence may, taken

cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence, although

each fact, when taken separately, may be a circumstance only of suspicion.

Page 9 of 18

The jury is entitled to draw inferences unfavourable to an accused where he

is not called to establish an innocent explanation of evidence given by the

prosecution, which, without such explanation, tells for his guilt.

In the case of Regina Vs. Exall (176 English Reports, Nisi Prius at page 853),

Pollock, C.B. considering the aspect of circumstantial evidence remarked;

It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a chain,

and each piece of evidence as a link in a chain, but that is not so, for then,

if any one link brock, the chain would fall. It is more like of a rope composed

of several cords. One strand of the rope might be insufficient to sustain the

weight, but three stranded together may be quite of sufficient strength.

It was observed in the case of Karunaratne Vs. Attorney-General (2005) 2 SLR

233,

Per Jagath Balapatabendi, J.,

The primary advantage of circumstantial evidence is that the risk of perjury

is minimized since it, unlike direct evidence, does not emanate from the

testimony of a single witness. It is therefore more difficult to fabricate

circumstantial evidence, than it is to resort to falsehood in the course of

giving direct evidence.

There is no principle of the law of evidence which precludes a conviction in

a criminal case based entirely on circumstantial evidence. There are no

uniform rules for the purpose of determining the probative value of

circumstantial evidence. This depends on the facts of each case.

In the case of Krishantha de Silva Vs. The Attorney General (2003) 1 SLR

162:

Per Edirisuriya, J.,

It is admitted that this is a case of circumstantial evidence. In such a case,

circumstances relied upon should be consistent with the guilt of the accused

Page 10 of 18

and inconsistent with his innocence. If the circumstantial evidence relied

upon can be accounted for on the supposition of innocence then the

circumstantial evidence fails. Circumstantial evidence can be acted upon

only if, from the circumstances relied upon the only reasonable inference to

be drawn is the inference of guilt. If the circumstances are consistent both

with guilt and with innocence then the case is not proved on circumstantial

evidence. The hypothesis of innocence must be excluded by the

circumstances relied upon and the circumstances must point to one

conclusion alone, i.e. the guilt of the accused. The learned trial Judge has in

detail discussed these principles to be followed in appreciating

circumstantial evidence in the instant case.

The 1st, 3rd and the 4th ground of appeal urged before this Court relates to the

alleged section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance recovery made by the police as a

result of the statement made by the appellant. Based on his statement, police

have recovered a cable from the vicinity where the body was found, which had a

blue-coloured piece of cloth wrapped on one end of it. They have also recovered

several blue-coloured pieces of cloth from the house of the appellant, which

matched the earlier mentioned wrapped cloth and the other piece of cloth

recovered by the main investigating officer near the body.

Although a ground of appeal was raised on the basis that the evidence in that

regard by the main investigating officer was contradictory and inconsistent, I am

unable to find such contradictions and inconsistencies.

I am not in a position to conclude that the learned High Court Judge was

misdirected as to the relevant applicability of a section 27 statement as

contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant.

It is settled law that the value that can be attached to a recovery made based on

a section 27 statement is to impart the knowledge of the fact discovered to the

person who made the statement.

Page 11 of 18

The Indian Supreme Court in the case of Kottaya Vs. Emperor 1947 AIR PC at

Page 70 held;

In Their Lordships' view it is fallacious to treat the' fact discovered' within

the section as equivalent to the object produced; the fact discovered

embraces the place from which the object is produced and the knowledge of

the accused as to this, and the information given must relate distinctly to

this fact. Information as to past user, or the past history, of the object

produced is not related to its discovery in the setting in which it is

discovered. Information supplied by a person in custody that 'I will produce

a knife concealed in the roof of my house' does not lead to the discovery of

a knife; knives were discovered many years ago. It leads to the discovery of

the fact that a knife is concealed in the house of the informant to his

knowledge, and if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission

of the offence, the fact discovered is very relevant. But if to the statement

the words be added 'with which I stabbed A these words are inadmissible

since they do not relate to the discovery of the knife in the house of the

informant.

In Rex Vs. Jinadasa 51 NLR 529, the evidence against the accused was purely

circumstantial. This was a case of murder using a katty consequent to

information given by the accused. The body was found the next morning. In his

statement the accused also stated I can point out the place where I threw it.

The katty was discovered thereafter. The main question which came up for

consideration in this case was whether any oral information given by the accused

could be used to prove a discovery of a fact. It was held, that even where a fact

had been discovered consequent to an oral information, such evidence can be

led.

In Rex Vs. Packeerthamby 32 NLR 262, it was held that even though a

confession may be generally inadmissible, any discovery could be proved under

Page 12 of 18

Section 27. This judgment was cited with approval in Iver Vs. Galgoda 44 NLR

94.

It is clear from the judgment under appeal that the learned High Court Judge

has not used the recovery made in terms of the statement made by the appellant

as the sole reason for the conviction. The learned High Court Judge has only

considered the fact that if not for the knowledge of the appellant, the said

discoveries would not have been made, in her deliberations and evaluation of

evidence, as pieces of circumstantial evidence against the appellant, for which I

do not find any reason to disagree.

The 2nd ground of appeal was on the basis that the prosecution has failed to

establish the chain of custody of productions.

It is clear from the evidence that it was the main investigating officer (PW-11),

who has recovered the cable alleged to have been used in committing the crime

and blue-coloured pieces of cloth from the crime scene, as well as from the

kitchen of the appellants house. The cable and the pieces of cloth recovered from

the house have been recovered based on the section 27 statement of the

appellant. After the discovery, the cable has been kept as it is until the arrival of

the Magistrate to hold the inquest, and thereafter, all the relevant productions

have been handed over to the police reserve. After obtaining a Court order in that

regard, the relevant productions have been sent to the Government Analyst

under proper custody and had been duly returned after the Government Analyst

Report was made available. Although it was alleged that there had been a break

in the chain of custody, I do not find any reason to accept such a contention.

The ground of appeal number 5, 6, and 7 was on the basis that the police

statement of the main witness, namely PW-07 (the father of the appellant), has

been obtained illegally under duress and torture, and because of the inherent

weaknesses of his evidence, it was unsafe to place reliance on such evidence. It

was also argued that the evidence of PW-07 was contradictory to that of PW-10.

Page 13 of 18

According to the evidence of PW-07, who was the father of the appellant, the

appellant has come home a day after the deceased was last seen and has

confessed to him that the deceased is dead.

It was contended by the learned Counsel for the appellant that the PW-07 was

taken into custody by the police and had been assaulted according to his own

evidence, and therefore, his statement has been recorded under duress, and

thus, evidence based on such a statement cannot be accepted as a basis for a

conviction.

When the relevant police officer who recorded the statement of PW-07 gave

evidence before the Court, he has denied that PW-07 was assaulted and his

statement was recorded under duress. That was the reason for the argument

that the evidence of PW-07 and PW-10 are contradictory in that regard.

It is the view of this Court that no police officer will admit an assault of a person

under police custody when giving evidence in a Court of law. It is my view that

such a denial in itself cannot be considered as contradictory to the evidence of

PW-07.

The admissibility of evidence obtained by illegal, improper or unfair means has

been well discussed by E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his authoritative book, Law

of Evidence, Volume II (Book 2) Chapter 27, pages 989 1041.

He has clearly expressed the view that such evidence cannot be excluded merely

on the basis that they were obtained illegally, improperly or by unfair means by

itself.

In the case of Rajapakse (Excise Inspector) Vs. Fernando (1951) 52 NLR 36,

a Supreme Court bench of three Judges consisting of Dias S. P. J., Gunasekara,

J. and Pulle, J. having considered a case where in a prosecution under the

Excise Ordinance, an excise officer tendered evidence which was discovered by

him in the course of an illegal or irregular search, overruling three decisions of

Nagalingam, J. on the same question, held that, such evidence was admissible.

Page 14 of 18

Murin Perera Vs. Wijesinghe (1950) 51 NLR 337, Andiris Vs. Wanasinghe

(1950) 52 NLR 83, and David Appuhamy Vs. Weerasooriya (1950) 52 NLR 87

overruled.

Held further;

1. That the Evidence Ordinance is a statute which consolidates and

amends the law of evidence. Therefore, the Courts are precluded from

refusing to admit admissible evidence on the ground of public policy.

The Courts are not empowered to invent a new head of public policy.

2. That while it may undesirable that agent provocateur and others should

tempt or abate persons to commit offences, it is not open to a Court to

acquit an accused person, where the offence charged is proved, on the

sole ground that such evidence was procured by unfair means. Such

considerations may affect the credit of the witness, but such evidence

is not inadmissible and therefore, when the offence charged has been

proved on such evidence, it is the duty of the trial Judge to convict.

In the appeal under consideration, although PW-07 says that he was arrested

and assaulted at the police station, he has not claimed that as a reason for him

to say that his son confessed to him of causing the death of the deceased. He

has clearly denied that he is giving such evidence under the influence of anyone

or falsely, but telling what was told to him by his son.

It was argued that the evidence of PW-07 refers to something what the appellant

has told his mother and not to the PW-07 himself. Therefore, such evidence

becomes hearsay evidence as the mother of the appellant has not given evidence

in the case, and hence, inadmissible.

However, I find that although PW-07 has commenced his evidence stating that

his son, after coming home told his mother about the death of the deceased, he

in fact told him as well, after he spoke to him about that. I find that the evidence

of PW-07 when taken in its totality, it becomes clear that he has not spoken

something not told to him by the appellant, but clearly of a confession made by

Page 15 of 18

the appellant to him, and also to his mother in the same process. I am of the

view that his evidence cannot be considered as hearsay under any circumstances

for the reasons as considered above. The evidence of PW-07 speaks about a clear

confession made to him by his own son. That goes on to show that the appellant

has made the confession voluntarily and on his own free will, may be out of his

own feelings of guilt in that regard.

In the ground of appeal number 8 and 10, it was argued that the learned High

Court Judge has failed to properly evaluate the dock statement made by the

appellant at the trial, and the Ellenborough Principle had been wrongly applied

by the learned High Court Judge in her judgment.

It is abundantly clear from the judgment that the learned High Court Judge has

clearly considered the evidence made available before the Court to come to a firm

finding whether the prosecution has established a strong prima facie case

against the appellant. The learned High Court Judge has listed the instances of

circumstantial evidence against the appellant and has determined that the

appellant has failed to give a reasonable explanation as to the incriminating

circumstantial evidence against him.

Although it is correct to argue that an accused person can remain silent, and

has no burden of proof in a criminal case, and also the burden of proving a

charge or charges beyond reasonable doubt is solely on the prosecution, it is

settled law that once the prosecution establishes a strong prima facie case

against an accused person, such a person is required to offer a reasonable

explanation that creates a doubt as to the incriminating evidence against him.

In this action, when the appellant was called upon for a defence, he has only

denied the allegation against him and has stated that his father, brother and the

police have initiated a false action against him. Other than that, he has not said

anything relating to the circumstantial evidence against him or the confession

made by him to his father. Even when the relevant witnesses were cross-

Page 16 of 18

examined on his behalf, no reasonable doubt or reasonable explanation has been

created as to the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his book, Law of Evidence, Volume1 at page 21

has observed in this regard as follows:

"The recent tendency of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka also appears

to be to expect an explanation of telling circumstances, though the failure

that is commented on is the failure of the accused to offer evidence and

not to give evidence himself. A partys failure to explain damning facts

cannot convert insufficient into prima facie evidence, but it may cause prima

facie evidence to become presumptive. Whether prima facie evidence will be

converted into presumptive evidence by the absence of an explanation

depends on the strength of the evidence and the operation of such rules as

that requiring a specially high standard of proof on a criminal charge."

In the case of Krishantha de Silva Vs. The Attorney General (supra), it was

held;

1. Even though the accused made a statement from the dock, he was

silent as to what happened after the deceased was placed on the bed;

the statement that he did not know anything about the incident cannot

be accepted.

2. An accused person is entitled to remain silent, but when the

prosecution has established strong and incriminating evidence against

him, he is required to offer an explanation of the highly incriminating

evidence. The accused has failed to bring an explanation of such

circumstances established against him.

In the Supreme Court case of Munasinghe Mudalihamy Koralage Dissanayake

Vs. The Director General, Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption

SC Appeal No. 160/2017 decided on 21-11-2023, Yasantha Kodagoda, P.C.,

Page 17 of 18

J. having considered in detail the value that can be attached to a dock statement

observed as follows;

Indeed, a person accused of having committed an offence has an unfettered

right to remain silent. That means there can be no compulsion on an accused

person to incriminate himself or to give evidence which is exculpatory in

nature. Be that as it may, an accused also has the entitlement to give

evidence under oath from the witness box. If at a time when the accused is

being ably defended by Counsel, he opts to make a dock statement which

is an unsworn statement from the dock, in my view a pragmatic and realistic

approach to criminal justice should necessitate the Court to consider inter-

alia as to why the accused has opted to make a dock statement. The reasons

are obvious. They are, (i) unwillingness to take an oath or affirmation before

commencing to give evidence, (ii) unwillingness to face cross-examination,

(iii) to prevent the contents of the dock statement being compared and

contrasted during cross-examination with the exculpatory statements and

admissible inculpatory statements.

Thus, while it is necessary to assess the credibility of the accused and the

testimonial trustworthiness that may be attributed to the testimony

contained in a dock statement, when doing so, the trier of facts (the Judge

or the jury as the case may be) must keep in mind the afore-stated factors

which has prompted the accused to make a dock statement. While the

contents of a dock statement should indeed be treated as evidence, it is

necessary to bear in mind that the evidential weight that may be attached

to a dock statement is much less than the weight that may be attached to

evidence given under oath or affirmation.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the learned trial Judge

has rightly determined the value of the dock statement made by the appellant,

and the dock statement as well as the defence taken up by the appellant has not

Page 18 of 18

created any reasonable doubt as to the evidence against him or has provided a

reasonable explanation which can be considered in favour of the appellant.

As I have already considered, I find no basis to accept that the evaluation of the

circumstantial evidence by the learned High Court Judge was deficient and

flawed. I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has well considered

the circumstantial evidence and also the confession made by the appellant to his

father and other relevant evidence, and has come to a finding that, the only

inference that can be drawn would be the inference of guilt of the appellant.

The learned High Court Judge has determined that the appellant is guilty to the

charge after having considered the relevant legal principles in its correct

perspective, which needs no disturbance from this Court.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no basis for the grounds of appeal

urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence dated 17-

01-2018 affirmed.
