The Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that evidence presented by

the prosecution warranted a case to answer, called for the defence and

explained the rights of the accused. The Appellant had made dock statement

and closed his case.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellant for charges 01,05,06 and 07 and

sentenced him as follows on:

Count No. 01. - Death Sentence.

Count No. 05 - 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment and fine of

Rs.10,000/- with a default sentence of 01 month

Simple Imprisonment.

Rs.10,000/- with a default sentence of 01 month

Simple Imprisonment.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment dated 29.05.2020 further

ordered that the sentences imposed on Count No. 05, 06, and 07 to run

concurrent to each other.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellant

had preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given his consent to argue this matter in his absence due to the Covid

19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform

from prison.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

According to PW1, Nilanka Kumara, on the date of incident when he was

going to the playground, he had met the Appellant and a person referred to

as son of Bomba Sunil. An argument erupted which ended up in a fight

between them. This was the first incident.

Secondly, when PW1 and other prosecution witnesses were in the

playground, the Appellant with the son of Bomba Sunil and the son of

Siripala had gone there and PW1 was attacked by the son of Siripala with

a hockey stick. At that time PW1 had seen a bomb was in the possession of

the Appellant. Due to this assault, he had run away from that place.

Third incident which led the death of the deceased and injuring several

people had taken place when PW1 with 12-15 persons got together and went

in search of the Appellant in retaliation to Bosevena Watta where the

Appellant resides. When the mob entered the Bosevana Watta according to

PW1, the Appellant had hurled a bomb at the mob which exploded and

injured several persons in the mob and caused the death of the deceased.

PW2, Tilak Perea who was a member of the mob went in search of the

Appellant and gave evidence and said that a person resemble to the Appellant

had thrown the bomb at them.

PW3, Pradeep Hemantha also gave evidence but not mentioned as to who

threw the bomb at them.

PW4, Upali Perera owner of a boutique stated that he had seen a mob

shouting in front of his house and had seen a bomb was thrown from

direction where the Appellant was but he did not see as to who threw the

bomb. He admitted that two groups were facing each other at that time.

CA/HCC/148/2020

PW16 Channa Ayeshmantha also gave evidence but did not see as to who

threw the bomb.

The Learned High Court Judge had considered the judicial dicta relating to

acting upon the evidence of a solitary witness concluded that the evidence

given by PW1 is convincing and acted upon the said evidence under Section

134 of the Evidence Ordinance to convict the Appellant.

The Appellant had raised following grounds of appeal.

1. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by convicting the Appellant

on the uncorroborated evidence of PW1.

2. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration

that the prosecution had failed to prove the identity of the dead body.

3. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration

whether the Appellant could be convicted for a lesser offence under

one of the special exceptions to Section 294 of the Penal Code.

4. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to evaluate the dock

statement according to the law and had failed to give proper reasons

in rejecting the dock statement.

The Learned High Court Judge in his judgment had come to the conclusion

that the evidence of PW1 is convincing and proved the charge beyond

reasonable doubt.

In The Queen v. K.A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the

evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden

is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to

give evidence and explain the circumstances.

CA/HCC/148/2020

Under the 1st ground of appeal, the Counsel for the Appellant contended that

he Learned High Court Judge failed to scrutinize the testimony of sole

eyewitness according to the principles established in law and failed to

evaluate the creditworthiness of the said witness.

Eyewitness testimony stands as one of the paramount types of criminal

evidence, posing a challenging yet pivotal task for judges in evaluating

criminal cases. This often entails scrutinizing whether the witness's

narrative aligns with established facts of the case. However, direct

verification or falsification of such accounts may not always be feasible.

Consequently, judges must assess the reliability of the source.

Moreover, while an eyewitness's testimony holds significant sway in court

proceedings, its accuracy in numerous cases remains questionable.

Evidence suggests that erroneous eyewitness accounts can result in

wrongful convictions, leading individuals to serve extended prison sentences,

and in severe cases, facing capital punishment for crimes they did not

commit.

When deliberating on eyewitness evidence, the court should consider various

factors, including the demeanour of the witness, the inherent plausibility of

the account, internal consistencies, consistency with prior statements,

potential biases, the compatibility of the account with crime scene evidence,

and corroboration from other witnesses. These considerations hold great

significance, especially considering that the burden of proof lies with the

prosecution in all criminal cases.

The Learned High Court Judge in considering the evidence given by PW1,

stated that his evidence was corroborated by the evidence given by PW2.

Although While PW2 initially stated that he witnessed the Appellant throwing

a bomb at them, he later mentioned observing a person resembling the

Appellant throwing the bomb.

According to PW2, the reason he could not identify the person who threw the

bomb was due to presence of number of people at that time.

PW4 had said that he saw the bomb thrown from the direction where the

Appellant was. This was due to presence of number of people at the place of

incident. According to him there were two groups facing each other at that

time. This evidence directly contradicts the testimony provided by PW1, the

purported eyewitness, as he claimed to have only seen the Appellant at the

entrance of "Bosevana Watta" and no one else. This evidence is a clear

contradiction of the evidence given by PW1, as the prosecution had not

framed charges under unlawful assembly or common intention. Further,

PW16, also not sure as to who threw the bomb at them at that time.

CA/HCC/148/2020

In Sumansena V Attorney General [1999] 3 Sri L.R. at 137 Justice

Jayasuriya observed that;

In our law of evidence, the salutary principle is enunciated that

evidence must not be counted but weighed and the evidence of a single

solitary witness if cogent and impressive could be acted upon by a court

of law. Section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance sets out that no particular

number of witnesses shall, in any case, be required for the proof of any

fact.

His Lordships in the above judgement is of the view that a person may be

convicted even on the evidence of one witness.

Witnesses are evaluated based on their credibility and reliability. Credibility

pertains to whether a witness is sincere and making genuine efforts to tell

the truth, or if they are trying to deceive or mislead the court. Reliability, on

the other hand, concerns whether the witness's memory or perception is

trustworthy and accurate.

In this case, a group people with PW1 had gone to Bosevena Watta in

search of the Appellant and his friends who had assaulted PW1. No one other

than PW1 had seen who had thrown bomb at them. Further, PW1s evidence

had been contradicted by other Prosecution witnesses on material points

which, in my view which certainly affects the root of the case. Therefore, I

am unable to agree with the Learned High Court Judge who delivered the

judgment as PW1s evidence is not cogent and impressive to act upon his

evidence only, to convict the Appellant. In the case, considering all the

circumstances, I conclude that the evidence of PW1 should be corroborated

with other witnesses as they went in a group to attack the Appellant. Hence,

I conclude that the prosecution had failed to establish as to who threw the

bomb at the time. As this ground is a substantial issue which cannot be

disregarded in this case.

CA/HCC/148/2020

10

Considering that the first ground of appeal raised is a significant issue that

undoubtedly impacts the outcome of the case, I hereby grant the appeal and

acquit the Appellant of all charges.

Since the first appeal ground presents a significant issue that

unquestionably alters the case's outcome, I will not consider the other

grounds raised in this appeal.

As the prosecution had not proven this case beyond reasonable doubt, I

quash the conviction and the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court

Judge of Colombo dated 29/05/2020 on the Appellant. Therefore, his appeal

is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
