The Petitioner observed that a few villagers in the area visit the said so-called church which is not a recognized place of religious worship by the Department of Christian Affairs to pray. The Petitioner states that the 7th and 8th Respondents intend to disqualify the Petitioner from obtaining a liquor license for the year 2019 by wrongfully and illegally construing that the said establishment is a Christian church. The impugned liquor license has been granted to the Petitioner after evaluation of his application and respective documents submitted with the application including the survey report. Hence, Petitioner claims that if any inconsistency with Exercise Notifications, inclusive of religious place of worship was located within a 500-meter radius from the licensed premises, the Exercise Department should have refused to grant the said license. In the absence, it is presumed that the said premises is in compliance with the requirements specified in the Excise Notifications and /or if any establishment exists it would have been constructed consequent of the issuance of said license. Accordingly, the Petitioner states that the direction of the 1st Respondent and /or 5th Respondent to carry out a further survey to ascertain whether the licensed premises of the Petitioner do not comply with the provision of Rule 20(c) of the Excise Notification No.902 and is mala fide and collateral and extraneous considerations. Therefore, it is claimed that granting a license to said premises complies with the provisions under the Excise Ordinance, the regulations made thereunder and the Petitioners legitimate expectation to carry on its business.",

Hence, there is no rigid rule to inform the Petitioner about such complaints received by the Commissioner prior to conducting the survey as per Rule 13(h)of the Excise Notification No.902.

    "text": "granted the license after evaluating the Petitioners application for liquor license with other relevant documents tendered thereon including the survey report P12. It is submitted that as the license was granted without any issue or demur and in compliance with the provisions of the Excise Notifications, the Petitioner would be able to form a legitimate expectation to carry out the business without any impediment. It is on the common ground that the liquor license (P3) issued to the Petitioner is conditional. The license (P3) itself refers that it is subjected to the general conditions applicable to all Excise Licenses, the conditions laid down in Excise Notifications and the special conditions laid down in the respective license. Therefore, the Petitioner was definitely aware that he would only be entitled to hold the license subject to the above conditions. Hence, the Petitioner would only be able to claim any legitimate expectation, if any, subject to the conditions laid down in the license including the power of the authorities to investigate public complaints therein. In Galappaththi v. Secretary to the Treasury 1996(2)SLR109 at 114, Ranaraja J. in the Court of Appeal held that a claim by a Petitioner that he has a legitimate expectation of receiving a benefit based on an assurance given to him by a public authority, cannot succeed if he has breached a condition specified in that assurance as one with which he must comply in order to receive the benefit.",

In the said circumstances, I hold that the Petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition of the Petitioner.
