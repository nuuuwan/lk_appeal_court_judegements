Decided On: 01.08.2024

M.C.B.S. Morais J.

In this instant case, the Party of the 2nd Part Petitioner-Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the petitioner) Mr. Jayamaha Mudalige Don Disal Sugath Priyankara is

challenging both the orders of the learned High Court Judge of Negombo dated 27th February

2024 in Revision Application No. HCR Rev 54/22 and the order of the learned Magistrate of

Welisara dated 28th September 2022 in Case No. 57021/21.

On the 30th of June 2021, the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent (subsequently referred to

as the Complainant herein) initiated legal proceedings by filing an information report

pursuant to section 66(1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 in the

Page 4 of 6

Magistrate's Court of Welisara. The report highlighted an ongoing dispute over land

involving the petitioner and the Party of the 1st Part Respondent-Respondents (herein after

referred to as the Respondents), alleging an imminent breach of peace.

The Honorable Judge of the Magistrate Court, Welisara has determined that, as of the date

when the initial information report was filed, possession of the subject land was held by the

Respondents, Jayamaha Mudalige Don Anthony Apollinaris and Jayamaha Mudalige Don

Mark Lucien Prasad and the petitioner has not been dispossessed of the said property within

two months prior to filing of the case, as for the provision of 68 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979. Consequently, the court has adjudicated that the Respondents

shall retain possession of the said land and the Respondents are entitled to maintain

possession of the land, or a designated portion thereof, until such time that they are lawfully

evicted through an order or decree issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

Being aggrieved by the said order issued by the learned Magistrate of Welisara, sought

recourse through a revision application in the High Court of Negombo. However, upon

consideration of the petitioner's application, the learned High Court Judge of Negombo, in an

order dated 27th February 2024 dismissed the application.

This petitioner has invoked our jurisdiction under Article 138 of the constitution, seeking the

relief of Restitutio in Integrum.

In the matter at hand, it is imperative to acknowledge the provisions of the Primary Courts'

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, which furnish temporary reliefs designed to preserve peace

within the community. While these measures serve an essential role, it is within the realm of

civil litigation that permanent resolutions are sought and established.

It must be emphasized that the invocation of the extraordinary jurisdiction of Restitutio in

Integrum is reserved for exceptional circumstances. This jurisdiction should not be engaged

unless the order in question is ex-facie contrary to accepted legal principles, leaves the

petitioner without any other remedy, is manifestly erroneous on its face, or is of such a nature

that it shocks the conscience of this court.

In the article, Two unusual appellate remedies: revision and restitutio in integrum in

the law of Sri Lanka - Jerold Taitz - Senior Lecturer Faculty of Law, University of Cape

Town and Attorney of the Supreme Court of South Africa states that,

Restitutio in Integrum originated in Roman law through the imperium (supreme judicial

powers) delegated to the praetors after the expulsion of the kings. It has been described as the

judicial termination of the inequitable situation (created by the law per se) and the restoration

of the status quo. There were two essential requirements for the grant of this discretionary

equitable remedy, namely:

(i) That the aggrieved party suffered loss or injury resulting from the effect of a valid

and binding legal principle, for which there was no ordinary remedy; and

(ii) That the presence of an equitable ground for the grant of restitution existed, more

particularly, fraud, duress, error, minority and absence.

Therefore, in the absence of these stringent conditions, we must refrain from utilizing this

extraordinary measure, adhering instead to the ordinary legal processes and remedies

available within the framework of civil litigation.

The Learned Magistrate of Welisara had considered the materials adequately and made a

decision according to the law. To resolve issues concerning land, there are alternative and

comprehensive legal remedies available within the legal system.

One of the grounds that the petitioner relies on is the delay in initiating the proceedings by

the complainant under the Primary Courts Procedure Act in the Magistrates Court after the

expiration of two months. It is contended that, it is beyond the control of the complainant

and they should not be penalized for such. If the delay was attributable to inefficiencies on

the part of the Police, the petitioner would have sought relief through a private application

under Section 66(b) of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act. The petitioners failure to pursue

this alternative remedy indicates a lack of diligence in enforcing their rights. Thus, the

absence of reasonable efforts on the part of the petitioner to address and rectify the delay

undermines the merit of their objection based on procedural timelines.

In light of these considerations, the petitioner's argument concerning the delay does not

warrant favorable consideration, as they have not demonstrated a reasonable effort to pursue

available remedies.

Therefore, the Learned Magistrate has acted according to the law. I do not find any injustice

or irremediable loss or illegality with the order of the Learned Magistrate of Welisara.

In light of the above, as this case does not fall within the scope of Restitutio in Integrum, I

refuse to issue notice on the Respondents.

Therefore, this application is refused and dismissed.
