(4) of the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011.

Upon service of the indictment, the Respondents raised several

preliminary objections which are set out below:

I. The first charge in the indictment is illegal as it has

exceeded one year which contradicts Section 174 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979.

II. Under Alter Ego principle, directors cannot conspire with a

company.

III. The Court cannot apply the provisions of Finance Business

Act No.42 of 2011 retrospectively to offences committed

under the Finance Companies Act.

After calling written submissions from the parties, the Learned High

Court Judge delivered his order on 06.10.2023. Upholding the 3rd

preliminary objection of the Respondents, the Leaned High Court Judge

discharged the Respondents from the case. In his order the Learned

High Court Judge had stated that proceeding for trial under defective

CA PHC APN 165-2022

5 | P a g e

indictment is pointless. He further held that the impugned order is not

a bar to file a fresh indictment against the Respondents.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo, the Petitioner had preferred this revision application before

this Court.

Background of the case

The 5th Respondent was registered as private limited liability company

on 21.05.2008. Among the other purpose, the said company was

primarily established for the purpose of engaging in Jewellery Business.

It was clearly mentioned in the Articles of Association and nowhere in

the Articles of Association mentioned that the company would engage in

Finance Business. In contrary, the company had engaged in Finance

Business without being registered as a Finance Company.

As the company failed to pay interest nor the capital to the depositors,

the matter was brought to the attention of His Excellency the President

and His excellency after considering the fact that the large number of

depositors and large amount of money had been defrauded, appointed a

Presidential Commission of Inquiry to look into the matter.

Based on the outcome of the inquiry, an investigation was conducted by

the Criminal Investigation Department and forwarded the same to the

Hon. Attorney General for necessary action. After considering the

investigation dossier, Hon. Attorney General forwarded an indictment

against the Respondents in the High Court of Colombo on 29.01.2021.

Both parties had agreed to resolve this matter through their respective

written submissions filed in this Court.

According to the Petitioner, Section 02 of Act No. 42 of 2011 requires a

company engaging in Finance Business to be registered as Finance

Business Company and accordingly licensed. Moreover, Section 02 of

Act No. 78 of 1988 also states that company engaging in Finance

Business needs to be registered as a Finance Company and accordingly

CA PHC APN 165-2022

6 | P a g e

licensed. Hence, it is quite apparent that the two offences in the two

enactments are identical.

Section 56 (1) of the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011 states:

(1) Any person who is guilty of an offence under subsection

(4) of section 2 of this Act shall be liable on conviction

after trial before the High Court to imprisonment of

either description for a term not exceeding five years or

to a fine not exceeding five million rupees or to both

such imprisonment and fine and to settle liabilities of

such person to depositors and other creditors under the

supervision of court:

Section 38 of the Finance Companies Act No.78 of 1988 states:

Every person who is guilty of an offence under this Act

shall be liable on conviction after trial before a

Magistrates Court to imprisonment of either description

for a term not exceeding three years or a fine not

exceeding one million rupees.

Section 71 of the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011 states:

(1) The Finance Companies Act, No 78 of 1988 is hereby

repealed.

(2) Notwithstanding the repeal of the Finance Companies

Act, No 78 of 1988, every regulation, notice, order, rule,

guideline or direction issued, requirement imposed,

determination or delegation made under the repealed Act

and in force on the day preceding the date of

commencement of this Act shall in so far as such regulation,

notice, order, rule, guideline, direction, requirement,

CA PHC APN 165-2022

7 | P a g e

determination or delegation is not inconsistent with the

provisions of this Act, be deemed to be a regulation, notice,

order, rule, guideline, direction, requirement, determination

or delegation issued, imposed or made, as the case may be,

under the provisions of this Act.

Under both Acts, non-registering a company which engage in Finance

Business need to registered and licensed. The outcome of violating this

requirement would end up in a criminal prosecution under both Acts.

Hence non-registering Finance Business has been criminalised under

both acts. Therefore, the offences prescribed in the repealed Act and the

new Act are identical and the new Act carry enhanced punishment than

the repealed Act. Hence, the Petitioner before the High Court took up

the position that, notwithstanding that with the enactment of Finance

Business Act 42 of 2011, the Finance Companies Act No. 78 of 1988 got

repealed, Section 71(2) of the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011

leaves an opening for the requirement of the registration of Finance

Companies Act alive and thereby it had continued to be a requirement

under the Finance Business Act No.42 of 2011. Accordingly, the offence

which is committed under the Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011

included any violation of the requirement under the Finance Companies

Act No. 78 of 1988.

The Learned High Court Judge, not considering the Section 71(2) of Act

No. 42 of 2011, held that Act No. 42 of 2011 does no specifically

recognize a retrospective effect of its offences under Section 56 of the

same. It was further held, that for an offence to have a retrospective

effect, the Act which created the offence should specifically state the

same in the Act.

But the Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the very

specific provision under Section 71(2) of Act No. 42 of 2011 which links

the two laws in all instances where it is not inconsistent with the new

law. Further, the change of laws should not pave way for the offenders

CA PHC APN 165-2022

8 | P a g e

to be acquitted or not charged for the offence that they had wilfully

committed.

Hence, I conclude that the failure to consider Section 71(2) of the

Finance Business Act No. 42 of 2011 in the impugned order of the

Learned High Court Judge is erroneous in law.

Therefore, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo dated 06.10.2023 and direct the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo to consider 1st and 2nd preliminary objections before procced

with the trial as per the indictment after issuing notice to the

Respondents.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo for necessary implementation.
