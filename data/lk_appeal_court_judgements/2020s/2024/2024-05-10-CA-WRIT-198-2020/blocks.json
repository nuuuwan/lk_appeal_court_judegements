    "text": "3 The Federalist, commonly referred to as the Federalist Papers, is a series of 85 essays written by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison between October 1787 and May 1788. The essays were published anonymously, under the pen name \"Publius,\" in various New York state newspapers of the time. The Federalist Papers were written and published to urge New Yorkers to ratify the proposed United States Constitution, which was drafted in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787. In lobbying for adoption of the Constitution over the existing Articles of Confederation, the essays explain particular provisions of the Constitution in detail. For this reason, and because Hamilton and Madison were each members of the Constitutional Convention, the Federalist Papers are often used today to help interpret the intentions of those drafting the Constitution.

    "text": "the common law, or principle of natural justice, that requires reasons to be given for administrative decisions, even decisions which have been made in the exercise of a statutory discretion and which may adversely affect the interests, or defeat the legitimate or reasonable expectations, of other persons. That this is so has been recognized in the House of Lords (Sharp v Wakefield [1891] AC 173 at 183; Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food [1968] AC 997 at 1032-33, 1049, 1050-54 and 1061-62) and the Privy Council (Minister of National Revenue v Wrights' Canadian Ropes, Ltd [1947] AC 109 at 123); in those cases, the proposition that the common law does not require reasons to be given for administrative decisions seems to have been regarded as so clear as hardly to warrant discussion. More recently, in considered judgments, the Court of Appeal in England has held that neither the common law nor the rules of natural justice require reasons to be given for decisions of that kind: R v Gaming Board; Ex parte Benaim [1970] 2 QB 417 at 430-31; Payne v Lord Harris [1981] 1 WLR 754 at 764 ; 2 All ER 842 at 850-51. It has similarly been held that domestic tribunals are not bound to give reasons for their decisions; see McInnes v Onslow-Fane [1978] 1 WLR 1520 ; 3 All ER 211 and earlier authorities collected in Pure Spring Co Ltd v Minister of National Revenue [1947] 1 DLR 501 at 534-5 The contrary view appears to have been expressed by Lord Denning MR in Breen v Amalgamated Engineering Union [1971] 2 QB 175, but that was a dissenting judgment and if it was intended to suggest that reasons must be given for the decision of a statutory or domestic body whenever the circumstances make it fair to do so it is inconsistent with R v Gaming Board; Ex parte Benaim, in which the judgment of the court was written by Lord Denning MR himself, and with Payne v Lord Harris, a decision to which Lord Denning MR was a party. https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/print?DocID=JUD%2F9ALNN85%2F00001 7 In Public Service Board of NSW v Osmond (1986) 159 CLR 656, the High Court held that there is no general duty to provide reasons for administrative decisions. The rule in Osmond has been criticised by scholars and greatly qualified by the introduction of statutory duties to give reasons. This Before the High Court examines the rule established in Osmond, the case for and against a general common law duty to provide reasons, and the various statutory duties to provide reasons. It also considers the recent law of several other common law jurisdictions, by which the courts have recognised limited duties to provide reasons for administrative decisions. The pending case of Wingfoot Australia Partners Pty Ltd v Kocak [2013] HCA Trans 105 (Kocak), for which special leave was granted on 10 May 2013, provides an occasion for limited but important change to the law.

This is a case of great consequence, both as to the property, the honour, and the learning, of this university, and concerns every graduate there, to law. though at present it is the case only of one learned man, and the head of a college. The question is, whether the university can suspend and degrade, and by what rules they may proceed in either or both of these cases ? And to this matter, it is allowed they may suspend or degrade for a reasonable cause; but then the cause must be specially set forth, that the Court may judge whether it is reasonable, and accordingi And upon this ground it is, that a return of a suspension for contumacy generally will not be good, for the particulars of the contumacy ought to be specified. 5 Rep. 57. [162] It is agreeable to law, that a man shall not be deprived of his property without being heard, unless it be by his own default ; but it is hard that it should be in the power of one man to suspend or degrade another without any appeal for if he should err, as all men are subject to error, then the person suspelded or degraded has no remedy. It is allowed, that this university has a jurisdiction in several cases ; and this Court will support them in the exercise of such jurisdiction, if they do not exceed their proper bounds and limits. Now as to the return, there are several causes set forth both for the suspension and degradation, viz. in saying, \" that he would not obey the summons ; that it was illegal ; that the Vice-Chancellor stltd egit; and that he was not his judge ;\" aiid all this spoken to a beadle who served the process of their court, and in a very indecent manner, in diminution of the authority thereof, and to make it ridiculous, which is consequently a contempt thereof ; and if the like had been done to an officer of this Court, it would have been accounted a great indignity, and the person should be punished ; but then the matter must be brought before the Court in a proper manner: and whether that was done in this case is now to be determined. Now by this return it appears, that depositions for a con tempt were exhibited by the beadle, but it does not shew that those depositions were taken before a proper judge ; and this being the foundation of the degradation, it does not appear to this Court that they had any power to degrade",

All degrees were originally given by the Crown ; and though the present right of conferring them is prescribed for by the university, yet that prescription must be presumed to be founded upon a right derived by authority from the Crown; so that a person advanced to the degree of a doctor, &c. may be esteemed to be advanced by the King. There were no degrees among the Grecians or Romans, nor among the first Christians ; they began about the twelfth or thirteenth century, and have been since attended with great privileges and profits, universitatis is the proper Latin word for corporation. A learned man of this university told me, that there were no degrees ever granted there until the university was a corporation. The seminaries for education of youth were antiently held in the cathedrals of the churches of the first Christians.

Neither does it appear that Dr. Bentley was ever summoned to answer this contempt ; and it is against natural justice to deprive a man of his right before he is heard ; therefore if there was a custom so to do, such custom would be absolutely void ; and it is a thing of daily experience to grant prohibitions to Spiritual Courts, if they deny the defendants a copy of the libel, because such denial is against natural justice. And now to offer a common instance, viz. suppose an officer of this Court should show any contempt thereof, could he be deprived of his office for such contempt? Certainly he could not. It is true, they who have argued for the university insisted, that the proceedings there are according to the civil law, and this they have done to justify the suspension, without being summoned to answer the contempt; but it does not appear upon the return (upon which this Court is (164] to judge), that they proceed there by the civil law ; and if so, then the Court must intend that they proceed by the common law, which they have not done, for there is no manner of proof that the doctor was surnmoned to appear to answer the contempt; and it can never be said, that a court which proceeds according to the common (a) law, shall suspend or degrade a person without being heard or summoned. It is said likewise, that this was not a proceeding by virtue of a charter alone, but by a charter-confirmed by Act of Parliament. Now admitting that to be true, it must be granted that convictions, even upon Acts of Parliament, are frequently quashed, for not summoning the persons convicted, though not required by the statute, because it is still against natural justice to convict without hearing, The want of a summons is an objection that can never be got over. Had the custom been returned to deprive without summons, it had been void, as against natural justice. If a justice of peace convict any man without a summons, such conviction is void. I heard a learned civilian say, that God himself would not condemn Adam for his transgression until he had called him to know what he could say in his defence. Gen. iii. 9. Such proceeding is agreeable to justice. Admitting the university has a jurisdiction, yet this Court will inquire what they have done, and how they have used that jurisdiction, as it was done in * Bushel's9 case, where it was insisted, that the merits of the cause could not be inquired into upon the return of a habeas corpes, but it was over-ruled ; and this Court cannot affirm the proceedings in this case without over-ruling Bushel's case, and several other authorities of the like nature.",
