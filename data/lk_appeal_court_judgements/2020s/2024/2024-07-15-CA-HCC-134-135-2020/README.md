not preferred an appeal.

Facts in Brief

The prosecutrix, namely PW-01 has been the legally married wife of the 2nd

appellant during the time relevant to this incident. However, when she gave

evidence before the Court for the 1st time on 20-08-2020, she and the 2nd

appellant have been divorced.

According to her evidence, they had one child out of the marriage and was about

one and a half years old during the time relevant to this incident. Her marriage

with the 2nd appellant was in turmoil at that time. It has been alleged that the

Page 5 of 19

2nd appellant had various other relationships, and was attempting to divorce her.

He has failed and neglected to maintain her and his child.

On the day of the incident, the child has been taken by the childs grandmother

and the PW-01 had been alone in the house. Her husband, the 2nd appellant had

not come home in four days. While she was at home, the 1st accused whom she

knew well has come and inquired about her husband and has left. Since she was

alone in the house, she has gone to the neighbours house to sleep. While she

was sleeping in the night, she has heard a land master tractor being driven into

their house compound. After hearing the noise, she has returned to her house

where she has seen three individuals including her husband consuming arrack.

In her evidence-in-chief, she has stated that when she went to the house, he

gave me soda, without specifying who gave it to her. She has stated that she

drank it and as result, she felt dizzy and fell asleep. She has further stated that

she saw her husband intoxicated and in a state of unconsciousness. She has

stated further that Thariq, referring to the 3rd accused, held her by her leg and

placed his leg on her and whispered to her ear saying things similar to going to

bed with his wife. He had been on top of her when he stated the said things.

Later in her evidence, she has stated that it was Thariq who gave her soda, which

made her dizzy. After getting on top of her, Thariq has had sexual intercourse

with her and has moved away. Thereafter, the 1st accused had dragged her and

had left her close to her husband. She has seen all three of them lying in a row

and her husband vomiting and in an unconscious state.

When she got up, she has realized that it was 4 oclock in the morning and the

2 individuals had left. She has felt hungry and has seen her husband preparing

tea, but has not given anything to her. Around 6 oclock in the morning, she has

had a fight with her husband and after that, while carrying the lamp they had in

the house, it had accidently fallen on her, causing burn injuries to her body.

Thereafter, the husband has doused the fire and she has been taken to Muthur

Page 6 of 19

hospital and from there, to the Trincomalee General Hospital. She has received

treatment at the hospital for about 3 months.

Under cross-examination, she has admitted that she did not say that the three

persons who came had a bottle of arrack with them in her statement to the police.

She has also admitted that in her police statement, what she stated was that it

was her husband who gave her soda. She has explained the said discrepancy

stating that she said so without much thought, and, it came to her mind while

giving evidence actually it was the 3rd accused who did so.

It has been suggested to her that she did not say in her police statement that the

3rd accused Thariq kept his male organ inside her female genitals, to which she

has replied stating that she said so. However, she has admitted that she did not

state in her police statement what the 3rd accused whispered into her ear as

stated by her in her evidence. It has been suggested to her that since she was

angry with her husband and the others who came with him for consuming liquor

and believed that they are the persons who helped him in his affair with another

woman, a false complaint was lodged against them. She has dismissed it saying

that it was not the case.

After the conclusion of the evidence of the prosecutrix, the prosecution has called

PW-04 who was the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who examined the prosecutrix

at the Base Hospital Trincomalee. He has examined her on 26-05-2015 at 3.45

in the afternoon, which was nearly one and a half months after the alleged

incident.

Explaining this delay in examining the prosecutrix, the JMO has stated that she

has been a patient transferred from Muthur hospital on 26-05-2015 for further

medical treatment and there was no indication in the bed head ticket that the

police being informed of this incident. When he inquired her about the history of

the incident, it came to light that the burn injuries suffered by her was not self-

inflicted, but caused by some others who attempted to set fire on her.

Page 7 of 19

The JMO has recorded the history of the incident as narrated by the prosecutrix

after translating it to English language.

She has given the history of the incident stating that on 13-04-2015, she was

sleeping in the neighbours house and around 11 oclock in the night, Fahim and

Thariq who came with her husband raped her, and it was Thariq who raped her

and Fahim held her legs, and her husband too was present at the place of the

rape. She has also stated that since she had not eaten properly for the previous

three days, she fainted while she was being raped and had forgotten everything

what happened thereafter, and when she gained consciousness, she was

admitted to Muthur hospital. She has also stated to the doctor that her husband

used to ill-treat her and caused her pain of mind asking for a divorce, but she

never attempted to commit suicide by setting herself on fire by using kerosene

oil.

However, JMO has not been able to examine her vaginal area due to the fact of

it being in a swollen state as a result of the burn injuries.

PW-03 was the neighbour to whose house the prosecutrix has gone and stayed

until she left after hearing her husband has returned home. She has left the

house of PW-03 around 9.00 p.m., and on the morning of the following day at

around 6.30 p.m., PW-03 has heard the prosecutrix screaming. When she and

the other neighbours rushed to the house of the prosecutrix, they have seen her

ablaze and had taken steps to take her to the hospital for treatment.

PW-02 was another neighbour who has rushed to the scene after the incident.

According to the evidence of the police officers who conducted investigations into

the incident, first information in this regard has been received by the Muthur

police station from the police post of Trincomalee General Hospital on 16-04-

2015. However, it appears that the statement of the prosecutrix has been

recorded only on 21-05-2015. No explanation has been given as to the delay of

recording the statement of the prosecutrix. There is nothing to indicate that she

Page 8 of 19

was not in a position to make a statement to the police after her admission to

the hospital.

After the closure of the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge has

decided to call for a defence from the appellants as well as the 3rd accused. Both

the appellants have made lengthy dock statements.

The 1st appellant has admitted that he, along with the 2nd appellant and the 3rd

accused went to the house of the 2nd appellant and consumed liquor. He has

stated that after consuming liquor, he got drunk and fell asleep and left

afterwards. He has denied that he raped the prosecutrix or had any hand in

assisting anyone in that regard.

The dock statement of the 2nd appellant who was the husband of the prosecutrix

had been to the same effect. He has stated that he came home along with two

other friends believing that his wife would not be at home and they consumed

liquor, as a result, he got intoxicated and did not know what happened. When

he woke up in the morning, he has seen the 1st appellant and the 3rd accused

sleeping near the door of his house and saw his wife near him. Later, his wife

had an argument with him due to the fact of him receiving some phone calls.

While he was preparing tea, he saw the lamp that was lit in the house had

accidently fallen on his wife and she had received burn injuries.

The 3rd accused who has not appealed his conviction has given evidence under

oath. He has admitted that he had liquor along with the 1st and the 2nd appellant,

but has denied that he committed rape on the prosecutrix.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellants formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

belatedness and the test of promptness and spontaneity.

Page 9 of 19

2. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by not considering the

medical finding of the JMO that there was no penetration as evidenced

in the Medico-Legal Report.

3. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

absence of actus reus and mens rea.

4. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

absence of common intention.

5. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to analyze the

non-existence of the element of commission or abetting the commission

of participatory presence by each member.

6. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

absence of corroboration.

7. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

absence of resistance and implied consent on the part of the

prosecutrix.

8. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to analyze whether

the prosecutrix is a credible witness and her evidence satisfied the test

of consistency.

9. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by not considering the

failure to mark the 1st information by the prosecution which amounts

to a denial of a fair trial.

10. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to analyze the

identity of the accused when there was no ID parade.

11. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by mistaking as to which

was the 1st information.

12. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by concluding that the case

has been proved based on circumstantial evidence.

13. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by using the short history

given by the prosecutrix as corroboration of her own testimony.

Page 10 of 19

14. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by using the dock

statements of the 1st and the 2nd accused to corroborate the evidence

of the prosecutrix.

15. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by using the dock statement

of one accused against the other accused.

16. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider and

properly evaluate the dock statements of the 1st and the 2nd accused

and the evidence given on oath by the 3rd accused.

17. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to apply the maxim

falsus in uno falsus in omnibus.

18. Did the learned High Court Judge impose an illegal sentence in terms

of section 364(4) of the Penal Code.

19. Is the prosecutrix a competent witness against her husband in terms

of section 120 of the Evidence Ordinance.

20. Has the learned High Court Judge failed to appreciate that section

363(e) of the Penal Code excludes the possibility of committing rape by

a husband.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

Although 20 grounds of appeal were urged by the learned Counsel for the

appellants, I will now proceed to consider them together as they are interrelated.

The learned Counsel for the appellant, among other matters contended, pointed

out several misdirections of law by the learned High Court Judge in his

judgment, to argue that the judgment cannot be allowed to stand under any

circumstance due to the material infirmities of the judgment.

He was of the view that there was no credible evidence placed before the Court

to decide that the 1st and the 2nd appellant committed the offence of gang rape.

He pointed out several major discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecutrix

which has not been properly considered by the learned High Court Judge, which

if considered in the correct perspective, would make the evidence of the

Page 11 of 19

prosecutrix not credible. He contended that under the said circumstances, the

learned High Court Judge should have looked for corroboration of the incident,

which has not been considered. He also submitted that the delay in making a

complaint has not been considered and pointed out that considering the short

history given by the prosecutrix one and a half month after the incident to the

JMO as corroboration was a misdirection.

He also pointed out that this was not a case based on circumstantial evidence,

although the learned High Court Judge has considered alleged circumstantial

evidence in the judgment. Further, it was stated that the learned High Court

Judge has considered the dock statements made by the appellants as

corroborative evidence of the prosecution case, which was also a misdirection as

to the law. He pointed out several other infirmities in the judgment for the

consideration of the Court.

The learned SDSG submitted that the evidence has established that when the

prosecutrix returned home, the 2nd appellant who was her husband was drunk

and unconscious. He agreed that there was no evidence to establish that he was

in any way connected with an offence of gang rape, although he was convicted

of the said offence.

He submitted further, that the only evidence as stated by the prosecutrix against

the 1st appellant was the fact that he dragged and kept her near her husband.

He submitted that other than the said statement, there was no evidence as to

his participation of a gang rape. He agreed that apart from the above fact, there

was no other evidence to connect the 1st appellant for the offence of gang rape,

although, admittedly, he has been present and consuming liquor along with the

2nd appellant and the 3rd accused.

The learned SDSG conceded that there are several misdirections as to the

applicable law and the way the evidence has been considered by the learned High

Court Judge in his judgment, and agreed that he is not in a position to defend

the judgment due to the said misdirections.

Page 12 of 19

Before I proceed any further in considering the appeal, I would like to express

my appreciation to the learned SDSG for agreeing as to the infirmities in the

judgment and the strength of the evidence, as a responsible officer of the Court,

enabling the Court to decide on this appeal.

This is a case where the only eyewitness to the incident had been the prosecutrix

herself. I am in agreement with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the

appellants that the prosecutrix was not a credible witness for the trial Court to

act entirely on her testimony in order to decide that the prosecution has proved

its case.

There is no doubt that it is unfair to expect independent eyewitness accounts on

an incident of this nature. However, this Court is of the view that a trial Court

can rely on the evidence of a victim alone on an incident of rape, if it can be

decided that her evidence was credible in that regard.

This Court is very much mindful that looking for corroboration should not be the

norm in cases of this nature, and is also mindful of what the Indian Supreme

Court observed in the case of Bohoginbhai Hirijibai Vs. State of Gujarat (1983)

AIR S.C. 753 which stated thus,

In the Indian setting, the refusal to act on the testimony of as victim of

sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule, is adding insult to

the injury.

However, it is the view of this Court that in a situation where it is not prudent to

act only on the evidence of a prosecutrix, the Court should look for some

corroboration which connects the accused to the offence.

This view is supported by the decision in the case of Sunil Vs. The Attorney

General (1986) 1 SLR 230 wherein Dheeraratne, J. held:

Corroboration is only required or afforded if the witness requiring

corroboration is otherwise credible. If the evidence of the witness requiring

corroboration is not credible that testimony should be rejected and the

Page 13 of 19

accused acquitted. Seeking corroboration of a witnesss evidence should not

be used as a process of inducing belief in such evidence where such

evidence is not credible.

In the case of Inoka Gallage Vs. Kamal Addararachchi and Another (2002) 1

SLR 307, it was held:

Generally, a conviction of rape almost entirely depends on the credibility of

the woman so far as the essential ingredients are considered, the other

evidence being merely corroborative. There may be many factors in a case

tending to show that the testimony of the prosecutrix suffer from infirmities

or defects in a manner so as to make it either unsafe or impossible to base

a conviction on her evidence.

In the instant case, the indictment has been forwarded to the High Court on the

basis of gang rape committed by the appellants along with the 3rd accused. The

indictment has also included a charge against the 2nd appellant for committing

attempted murder on the prosecutrix.

It appears that the charges have been drafted by the Hon. Attorney General

based on the statements made by the prosecutrix to the investigators of the

matter and also on the non-summary proceedings before the relevant

Magistrates Court.

However, in giving evidence at the trial, the prosecutrix has stated that she

received burn injuries due to an accident, and not because her husband set her

on fire, which I see as a piece of evidence that creates a major concern as to her

credibility. Besides that, her evidence has been that her husband was drunk,

unconscious and even vomiting when she came to their house, which shows that

the husband has played no part at all in any incident of alleged gang rape, which

also creates a doubt as to the way she has narrated the incident before the trial

Court. Her evidence against the 1st appellant also does not suggest any

involvement by him to an offence of gang rape or aiding and abetting such an

offence.

Page 14 of 19

Besides that, she has stated in her evidence in chief that it was the 3rd accused

who gave her soda which made her dizzy after drinking it. However, it has been

established before the Court that in her statement to the police, what she has

stated had been that it was her husband who gave her soda which was also a

matter that raises a credibility issue as to the evidence of the prosecutrix.

I am of the view that the evidence clearly suggestive of an act committed by the

3rd accused making use of the drunkenness of the others who were present at

that time.

Explanation 01 in section 364(1) of the Penal Code, which explains the offence

of gang rape reads as follows;

Explanation 01 Where the offence of rape is committed by one or

more person in a group of persons, each person in each group

committing or abetting the commission of such offence is deemed to

have committed gang rape.

The offence of gang rape was introduced to the Penal Code by the Penal Code

(Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995. There was no offence of gang rape until such

time.

The object of introducing a specific offence as gang rape, including its

explanation and applicability has been explained by the Indian Supreme Court

in Promod Mahto and Others Vs. The State of Bihar (1989) SC 1475 in the

following words;

This explanation has been introduced by the legislature with a view of

effectively deal with the growing menace of gang rape in such

circumstances, it is not necessary the prosecution should not adduced

clinching proof of a completed act of rape by each one of the accused on the

victim or on each one of the victims when there are more than one in order

to find the accused guilty of gang rape and convict them under section 367

of IPC.

Page 15 of 19

Shirani Bandaranayake, J. (as she was then) having considered the relevant

provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the ingredients that should be proved

in relation to the offence of gang rape as stated in our Penal code, while

considering the above-mentioned case and several other cases in Sajeewa alias

Ukkuwa and Others Vs. The Attorney General (Hokandara Case) 2004 2 SLR

263 at 285 held as follows,

Accordingly, in terms of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act, there is no need

for a member of a group of persons to be held liable for an offence of gang

rape, to establish that each member of the group acted with a common

intention to commit the said offence. What is necessary is to establish that,

the accused had been members in the group and had either committed rape

or had abetted the said crime. Once it is established that one of the accused

had committed the offence of rape and there had been aiding and abetting

the all of them would be guilty under section 364(2)(g) in terms of

explanation 01 of the Penal Code (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1995

irrespective of the fact that whether the victim was raped by more than one

of them.

It is my view that since there was no evidence to establish that the 1st appellant

had sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix or he abetted the commission of the

offence of rape by anyone else in the group, there was no basis to conclude that

the prosecution has proved the offence of gang rape against him.

Another matter that needs the attention of this Court is the fact that the 2nd

appellant was the legally married husband of the prosecutrix when the alleged

incident has occurred.

Section 363 is the relevant section of the Penal Code, which describes the offence

of rape. This section states that a man is said to commit rape who has sexual

intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the stated

descriptions :-

Page 16 of 19

Description (e) of section 363 reads as follows,

With or without her consent when she is under 16 years of age

unless the woman is his wife who is over 12 years of age and is

not judicially separated from the man.

Section 120 of the Evidence Ordinance is a section that describes competent

witnesses before a Court of law.

Section 120(3) reads thus,

120. (3) In criminal proceedings against a husband or wife for any

bodily injury or violence inflicted on his or her wife or husband such

wife or husband shall be a competent and compellable witness.

It is my view that although section 120(3) of the Evidence Ordinance has stated

so, when it comes to a legally married wife giving evidence against her own

husband in a charge of rape, she cannot be considered as a competent witness

subjected to the provisions of section 363(e) of the Penal Code.

This is the very same question that has been considered by Sisira De Abrew, J.

in the case of Saman Kumara Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka (2009) 1 SLR 18

where it was held;

1. To call the wife of the husband under section 120(3), it should be

proceedings instituted against the husband for causing bodily injury or

violence to the wife. Section 120(3) envisages a situation where husband

or wife assaults his or her spouse but not when sexual intercourse was

performed on his wife by the husband.

2. The prosecution in a case of rape cannot call the wife of the accused to

give evidence against her husband. The prosecutrix is not a compatible

witness against the accused unless and until the marriage is declared

void by the District Court.

Page 17 of 19

In the above judgment, his Lordship considered the judgment in K.C. Morjan

Vs. Attorney General C.A. 3/2002 Court of Appeal Minute 13.01.2003

where the same question arose for consideration. In the said case, the

prosecutrix was the legally married wife of the accused. When the matter was

brought to notice of the trial Judge, he overruled the objection raised by the

defence.

Per Raja Fernando, J.

In terms of section 19 of the Marriage Registrations Ordinance or

section 607 of the Criminal Procedure Code it is only the District Court

that has the jurisdiction to either dissolve or annul a marriage. Further

section 42 of the Marriage Registrations Ordinance makes the

certificate of marriage proof of marriage. We hold the prosecutrix was

not a compellable witness against the accused unless and until the

marriage is declared void by the District Court.

In the instant case, since the prosecutrix has admitted that the 2nd appellant

was her legally married husband and the marriage was dissolved sometime after

this incident, I find that the prosecutrix was not a competent witness against the

2nd appellant when it comes to her evidence against him in relation to the charge

relating to gang rape, although she is a competent witness in relation to the 4th

charge relating to attempted murder.

In considering the corroborative evidence in relation to the evidence given by the

prosecutrix, the learned High Court Judge has considered the evidence of PW-

03, the occupant of the house where the prosecutrix was before she returned to

her house as corroborative evidence. Although it may corroborate the

prosecutrixs version of events before she left the house and returned to her own,

it has not provided any corroboration as to what happened thereafter, which

should be the material corroboration that should have been considered.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the history given to the JMO by

the prosecutrix as a corroboration of her story.

Page 18 of 19

There again, I find that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected as to the

history given in the MLR which can only show the consistency of a story narrated

by a victim of a crime, which does not provide corroboration per se of the

incident. Although the learned High Court Judge has discussed at length the

absence of corroboration and the fact that the corroboration is not always

necessary in cases of sexual offences, as I have reflected before, it is my

considered view that this a case where it is dangerous to act only upon the

evidence of the prosecutrix in the absence of corroboration.

The learned High Court Judge has considered several passages of the statements

made by the two appellants in their dock statements as corroboration of the

evidence of the prosecutrix and to find that against the appellants. Although the

appellants have made several admissions in their dock statements to the effect

that they went to the house of the 2nd appellant, consumed liquor and slept in

the house after they got drunk, that cannot in itself be considered as

corroboration of the offence of gang rape under which the appellants have been

indicted.

I find that there was no basis for the learned High Court Judge to consider the

principles of circumstantial evidence in his judgment as this was not a case

relied on circumstantial evidence to prove the charges against the appellants.

The evidence of the prosecutrix where she has stated that the 1st appellant pulled

her by her hand and left her near her husband has been compared with the

statement from the dock by the 1st appellant where he has stated that, when he

was sleeping on the floor, a hand fell on me and without knowing whose hand I

tossed the hand off as corroboration of the evidence of the prosecutrix. There

again, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge has considered the

dock statement in the wrong perspective to rely on it to convict the appellants.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge has clearly compared the evidence

of the victim against the dock statements of the appellants and the evidence

given under oath by the 3rd accused which was again a clear misdirection as to

the way the evidence should be considered in a criminal action.

Although there are several other misdirections in the judgment as pointed out

correctly by the learned Counsel for the appellants and conceded by the learned

SDSG, I find it unnecessary to consider the said arguments any further, as the

judgment cannot be allowed to stand on the above considered legal grounds

alone.

I am of the view that the prosecution has failed to prove the offence of gang rape

against the two appellants.

As stated by Sisra De Arbrew, J. in C.A. No.100-2002 decided on 20.07.2007,

in this instance too, I am reminded of the sacred and respected view adopted

throughout by our Courts, that is to say,

It is better to acquit hundred offenders, rather than to send one innocent

man to jail

Therefore, I am of the view that the prosecution case was saddled with doubts,

which can be termed as reasonable doubts that should have been considered in

favour of the appellants.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction of the appellants by the judgment dated

02-11-2020 and the sentence imposed upon them.

The 1st and 2nd accused-appellants are acquitted of the respective 1st and the 2nd

counts preferred against them.
