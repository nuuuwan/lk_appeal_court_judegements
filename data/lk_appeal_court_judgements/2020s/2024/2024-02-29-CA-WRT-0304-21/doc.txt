Decided on: 29.02.2024

Sobhitha Rajakaruna J.

The Petitioners plead that the 1st Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent under a joint venture

agreement were manufacturing Black Tea after processing refuse tea using refuse tea of the

3rd Respondent and other tea factories not owned by the 3rd Respondent. The Sri Lanka Tea

Board - 1st Respondent (SLTB) on 21.01.2021 issued a Circular marked P24 prohibiting

plantation companies from purchasing refuse tea from tea factories not owned by such

plantation companies for the processing of refuse tea. The Petitioners state that before issuing

P24, the SLTB on 21.05.2018 has taken a board decision (P25)

1. to request from all Regional Plantation Companies (RPC);

Page 4 of 12

i) to have re-processing centers for their own refuse tea,

ii) that all refuse tea processing factories of RPCs should be managed by RPC

management itself.

2. if there are any difficulties with regard to the capacity utilization, RPCs are in a

position to purchase refuse tea from other RPCs for reprocessing,

Based on a mutual agreement between the Petitioners and the 3rd Respondent, the 1st

Petitioner Company has commenced renovating the factory and burner at the Mathurata Tea

Factory belonging to the 3rd Respondent, who has authorized the 1st Petitioner Company to

commence operations after completion of such renovations. The 1st Petitioner has mortgaged

the said property and secured a bank loan amounting to rupees 12 million from the Bank of

Ceylon to renovate the above factory. The joint venture agreement No.79 signed between the

1st Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent on 06.06.2018 is marked as P15.

While such renovations were in progress the 3rd Respondent served a notice of termination

dated 12.03.2021 (P31) on the 2nd Petitioner informing the decision of the 3rd Respondent to

terminate the said joint venture agreement under its Clause 2.5.3. The issuance of the

aforesaid Circular marked P24 by the SLTB is cited as one of the grounds for such

termination. The 3rd Respondent states in the said letter that the Petitioner Company in terms

of the said Circular marked P24 will no longer be able to process refuse tea purchased from

tea factories other than the refuse tea produced by factories belonging to the 3rd Respondent.

As a result, the Petitioners claim that they had to face a severe crisis since the 1st Respondent

Company had been compelled to incur a huge production cost together with bank interests,

wages of the employees, factory rentals, electricity bills, etc. while producing only a meager

quantity of Black Tea by reprocessing refuse tea. The 3rd Respondent relies on the below-

mentioned Clause 2.5.4 of the said joint venture agreement (P15) and claims that in the

event that the joint venture agreement is terminated, the Petitioner Company will not be

entitled to compensation or damages for improvements made to the relevant premises.

On these presents being terminated for whatever reason or on its expiry the Party of the Second

Part shall:

Page 5 of 12

(i) deliver quiet, peaceful and vacant possession of the said subject premises to the MPL inclusive

of all the buildings, improvements, machinery fixtures and fittings thereon.

(ii) pay all the outstanding dues up to the date of expiry or the termination of the Joint Venture

and all taxes, duties and charges referred hereto.

(iii) Not claim any compensation or damages from the MPL for the improvement done in the

said subject premises by Party of the Second Part.

In the circumstances, the Petitioners seek relief in the form of orders to quash the said Circular

marked P24 issued by the SLTB and also to prohibit the 3rd Respondent from dispossessing

the Petitioners and or handing over the relevant premises to any other person.

Firstly, I must consider whether this Court can interfere with the decision of the 3rd

Respondent to terminate the said joint venture agreement or to dispossess the 1st Petitioner

from the factory premises belonging to the 3rd Respondent. The pivotal argument of the 3rd

Respondent is that the said joint venture agreement or the notice of termination is not

amenable to the writ jurisdiction of this Court. Referring to paragraph (i) of the prayer of the

Petition, the 3rd Respondent submits that the Petitioners have already conceded the placing of

the contractual rights on the joint venture agreement with the 1st Petitioner Company itself.

The 3rd Respondent relied on the judgement of Waligama Multi-purpose Cooperative Society

Ltd vs. Chandradasa Daluwatte (1984) 1 Sri L.R. 195. Sharvananda J. (as he was then), in the

said judgement giving reference to the case of Perera v. Municipal Council Of Colombo, (1947)

48 N. L. R. 66, has held as follows:

The Writ will not issue for private purposes, that is to say for the enforcement of a mere private

duty stemming from a contract or otherwise. Contractual duties are enforceable by the ordinary

contractual remedies such as damages, specific performance or injunction. They are not

enforceable by Mandamus which is confined to public duties and is not granted where there are

other adequate remedies.

During recent times this Court has repeatedly enhanced the jurisprudence in respect of

invoking writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal concerning matters of contractual nature. In

Dr. D. Wijewardena and Others v. E. M. A. J. Ekanayake, President, Nilanthattuwa Farmers

Organisation and Others CA/Writ/ 63/2021 (decided on 10.01.2024) it was held that this

Page 6 of 12

court should be able to exercise its writ jurisdiction even in respect of an organization which

can be considered as a Club or an Association, to the extent necessary to ensure giving due

effect to certain provisions of a statute. Further, this Court has constantly decided1 that the

Court of Appeal has the discretionary power to exercise writ jurisdiction even on a question

arising out of a contract of employment, inter alia if the disciplinary order of a public authority

was in breach of statutory restrictions/ provisions.

In Ajith Siyambalapitiya and another v. Hon. Minister of Sports and Others

CA/WRIT/139/2021 decided on 17.01.2024, I have decided that:

I take the view that the question of whether one could invoke the writ jurisdiction against a body

corporate such as the SLC should be determined based on facts and circumstances of each case.

One cannot consider only the statutory flavour in the decision-making process of such an entity

to be the exclusive need for invoking writ jurisdiction. In addition to the element of statutory

flavour it is important to consider whether this court should be able to exercise its writ jurisdiction

in respect of such corporate body to the extent necessary to ensure giving due effect to the relevant

provisions of any statute passed by Parliament. (Emphasis added)

I am unable to capture any constructive or substantive link between the conditions in the said

joint venture agreement and the statutory foundation of the impugned Circular marked P24

issued by the SLTB. It cannot be assumed that a quashing order could be issued by this court

against the decisions (P40 & P41) of the 3rd Respondent to terminate the joint venture

agreement even in the event this Court decides to quash the said Circular P24. In light of the

above judicial precedent and based on the facts and circumstances of this case I take the view

that the Petitioner is not entitled to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this Court in reference to

the alleged grievance or the matters emanating from the termination of the said joint venture

agreement by the 3rd Respondent.

Now I must consider whether the SLTB or the Tea Commissioner (the 2nd Respondent) have

exceeded their powers when issuing the impugned Circular P24. The Petitioners argue that

1 See: W G Chamila v Urban Development Authority and others CA/WRIT/215/2022 decided on 26.10.2022; Devendra Budalge Sudesh Lalitha Perera v Janatha Estates Development Board and others CA/WRIT/004/2022 decided on 06.10.2022; Vithanage Vajira Kelum Perera v Sudath Rohana Chairman, Independent Television Network and Others CA/WRIT/508/2021 decided on 29.08.2023

Page 7 of 12

the said P24 purports to distinguish, differentiate and/or discriminate against plantation

companies that do not possess refuse tea processing factories and accordingly it violates

Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution. The Petitioner further asserts that the 1st and

2nd Respondents have no power or jurisdiction to compel plantation companies to build tea

processing factories in addition to tea manufacturing factories. Similarly, the Petitioners

submits that the 1st Respondent has no power or authority to dictate terms and/or give any

direction to plantation companies prohibiting 3rd parties from managing tea processing

factories of such plantation companies as it is not within their purview.

Contrary to the above, the Tea Commissioner - 2nd Respondent, affirming an Affidavit on

04.11.2022, justifies the issuance of the said impugned Circular marked P24 as follows:

Answering to the Petition I further state as follows;

(a) In order to regulate the malpractices reported in the refuse tea industry the board of

the 1st Respondent decided to request Regional Plantation Companies to process tea

under their own management without subleasing the same to a 3rd party

(b) Due to continued practice of refuse tea processed by 3rd parties the board decision was

implemented by the issuance of the impugned circular marked as P24 to the Petition

to regulate the processing of refuse tea.

(c) the impugned circular annexed as P24 to the Petition has been issued in order to ensure

that Refuse Tea manufactured by a particular company is made utilizing only the tea

leaves from the plantation of that company. Thus, a company that brands its products

as X, cannot purchase tea leaves from plantation Y and manufacture Refuse Tea

market the same under the brand X. The tea marketed under the brand X must be

manufactured from the tea leaves from the plantations belonging to X.

(d) each Plantation manufactures a unique brand of tea with a distinct flavour. Purchasing

from other plantations can lead to mixing of tea from different plantations. This will

undermine the distinctiveness of a particular plantation and compromise the

perception of quality of Ceylon Tea in the foreign market.

Page 8 of 12

(e) the circular annexed as P24 to the Petition has been issued as a quality control measure

with a view to protecting the high standards of the tea industry.

(f) the Petitioner Company does not have the necessary approvals to engage in the tea

manufacturing/processing industry. Thus, the enterprise of the Petitioner Company is

an illegal operation.

(g) the Maturata Tea Company has not obtained the necessary approvals required for the

leasing of the factories to the Petitioner Company. Thus, the enterprise of the

Petitioner cannot be lawfully carried on at the said factories.

(h) Therefore, the motivation to issue P24 and P25 was the need to protect the unique

taste flavour, name and recognition of tea produced in specific estates. As such it was

necessary to ensure that the processing of refuse tea by a particular factory was limited

to the refuse tea cultivated in that particular estate.

The preamble of the Tea Control Act, No.51 of 1957 declares that it is an Act to provide for

the registration of tea plantations and the proprietors thereof; for the registration of tea

manufacturers and the factories operated by them; for the development and maintenance of

tea plantations and tea factories and the consequences for non-compliance with orders issued

by the Commissioner; for the control of the planting and replanting of tea, the possession,

sale, transport and purchase of tea, and the exportation of tea, tea seed and such parts of the

tea plant as are capable of being used for propagation; for the imposition of an export duty on

tea; for the establishment of a Tea Advisory Board; and for matters connected therewith or

incidental thereto.

I am aware that maintaining the high standards of Ceylon Tea in global markets is crucial

due to its vital role in the Sri Lankan economy. As one of the main exports, the success of the

tea industry has a direct impact on employment, foreign currency earnings, and overall

economic stability in the Country. With its renowned taste and scent, Ceylon tea represents

Sri Lanka's rich cultural heritage and dedication to quality. Guaranteeing its consistent quality

overseas not only strengthens Sri Lanka's position as a top global tea producer but supports

the livelihoods of numerous smaller tea farmers and workers also. Therefore, I take the view

that the scheme of the said Act essentially provides to preserve the reputation of Ceylon tea

Page 9 of 12

in international markets which is essential for the Nation's economic prosperity and global

reputation. Thus, a strong and accountable obligation is cast upon the Tea Commissioner and

the SLTB to uphold the expected true aims and goals of the said Act passed by Parliament.

Thus, the role of the SLTB or the 2nd Respondent should be assayed or interpreted in line with

such goals and aims of the said Act.

In this backdrop, I must examine the assertions of the Petitioners that their rights, particularly

under the said Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g), have been affected due to the said Circular P24.

In R.A. Piyaratna and Others v. Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka and Others

CA/Writ/133/2022 decided on 10.06.2022 I have observed as follows:

The Public Trust Doctrine and/or violation of fundamental rights or any other ground

established through judicial creativity should be adopted in judicial review applications only as

a conduit to make a determination by Court subject to the provisions of the Constitution and

according to law. I find that the grounds for review in writ applications are inextricably

interwoven with the fundamental rights recognized by law and however the adoption of such

grounds should be carefully done by Review Courts subject to above limitations based on the

respective jurisdiction of the Court. Therefore, I am compelled to focus my mind with the issues

of the instant application in those lines and not make any determination just on a mere assertion

of an infringement of fundamental rights of a person.

It is important to note that most of the correspondence annexed to the Petition are letters

exchanged between the 1st Petitioner Company and the 3rd Respondent Company. I cannot

find any letter addressed to the SLTB by the Petitioners, except the letter marked P27, by

which the 2nd Petitioner has sought information under the RTI Act2. The Managing Director

of the 1st Petitioner Company, within a period of almost one and half months from the date

of issuance of P24 has informed the 3rd Respondent by its letter dated 09.03.2021 marked

P38 that justice had been served to the Petitioners as a result of the frequent discussions with

the Tea Commissioner regarding the issues that arose in relation to the impugned Circular

P24. The Petitioners further clarify in the said letter that the license to get tea from other

2 Right to Information Act No. 12 of 2016

Page 10 of 12

estates to carry out the work of the respective factory has been granted by the SLTB on

04/09/2021 under license number GM/MF/612/2021/271.

In consideration of the above statement made by the Petitioners in the said P38, I cannot

seem to find a justification as to why they would now choose to challenge the said Circular

P24 in the instant Review Application. The Petitioners further plead that they had carried

out the renovations with the legitimate expectation that they may purchase refuse tea from

any tea factory Island-wide for processing refuse tea as was customarily done. The Petitioners

contend that if P24 is complied with, the 1st Petitioner will be limited to purchasing refuse

tea only from companies owned by the 3rd Respondent and would suffer considerable loss

while repaying their bank loan. Similarly, the Petitioners claim cheating and unjust

enrichment on the part of the 3rd Respondent as reasons to seek relief from this Court.

However, I take the view that none of the above reasons can be considered as substantive

material to establish ultra vires of the decision made by the Tea Commissioner in P24.

Section 24 of the said Tea Control Act deals with the permits for purchase of refuse tea. The

Tea Commissioner may, on application made in that behalf, issue a permit to any person to

purchase or take delivery of refuse tea. In general, when a permit is issued the operational

limits, restrictions or other guidelines will be set down by the authority who is empowered to

grant permission for execution of specific operations under such permit. In terms of section

24(2) every permit issued under subsection (1) shall-

(a) specify the maximum quantity of refuse tea which may be purchased under the authority

thereof;

(b) specify the manufacturer from whom such a quantity may be purchased;

(c) specify the date on which the permit shall cease to be valid; and

(d) contain such conditions as the Commissioner may consider necessary, including conditions

specifying or restricting the purposes for which the refuse tea may be used by the holder.

The said section 24(2) confers a considerable amount of discretion upon the Tea

Commissioner to specify the manufacturer from whom such a quantity may be purchased

and also to specify the maximum quantity of refuse tea which may be purchased. This reflects

Page 11 of 12

that the 1st or 2nd Respondents have the authority within their purview to regularize the

operations of plantation companies concerning refuse tea. However, the Petitioners have

failed to establish that the impugned decision marked 'P24' is eminently irrational or

unreasonable or is guilty of an illegality. Likewise, during the course of hearing into the instant

application it did not appear to this Court that there is prima facie evidence of an infringement

or imminent infringement of the provisions of Articles 12(1) and 14(1)(g) by any of the

Petitioners.

At the same time, I cannot possibly overlook the contents of the letters [P39(b) and P39(c)]

issued by the 3rd Respondent to the 1st Petitioner, whereby the 3rd Respondent has made strong

allegations on the purported undue intentions of the 1st Petitioner Company revolving around

the said impugned Circular. I can summarize the relevant paragraph in P39(c) as follows;

Likewise, the Mathurata Tea Factory was given to Rado Lanka Private Limited for a period of

10 years and agreements were signed. So far, a period of 03 years from the contracted period has

been completed. It appears that efforts are being made to cancel this agreement by including these

Circulars and creating some problems. There are 07 more years to the end of the contractual

period. By linking this Circular there is an attempt to deceive our institution in hopes of selling

this factory to another company for more money.

Similarly, it is vital to take into consideration the fact that the 3rd Respondent has instituted

action bearing case No.DSP/158/2021 in the District Court of Colombo seeking, inter alia,

the eviction of the 1st Petitioner from the aforesaid factory premises. Hence, it is noted that

the District Court of Colombo has assumed jurisdiction over the disputes between the 1st

Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent upon the said joint venture agreement.

In the above circumstances, I am compelled to hold that the impugned Circular marked P24

is not unlawful and ultra vires of the said Tea Control Act. I am convinced with the

justification elaborated in the Affidavit of the 1st Respondent in issuing P24. The reasons

given therein outweigh the assertions of the Petitioners who claim that their rights have been

affected as a result of the said P24. Furthermore, based on the circumstances of this case, I

am of the opinion that the termination of the joint venture agreement by the 3rd Respondent

cannot be subjected to Judicial Review.

Page 12 of 12

In view of the foregoing, I hold that the Petitioners are not entitled to any of the reliefs as

prayed for in the prayer of the Petition. Hence, I proceed to dismiss the instant Application.

Application is dismissed.
