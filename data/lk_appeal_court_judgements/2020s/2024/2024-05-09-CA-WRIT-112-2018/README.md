Decided on: 09th May 2024

D.N. Samarakoon, J

The petitioner seeks to quash P. 54.

It contains one and a half (1 ) pages.

It says,

6 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

(i) Samantha Gunasekera in his evidence referred the attention of the

Committee to the act of corruption committed in 2007 in the process of

importing an elephant from Burma to Sri Dalada Maligawa

(ii) Usually the value of an elephant in the open market is 10 or 15 lackhs

(iii) But in importing an elephant for Sri Dalada Maligawa in 2007 it has been

stated in invoices the value as Rs. 261,592,500/- and remitted that

money overseas by Custom receipt No. 97382 according to his evidence

(iv) Hence those who were involved on behalf of the Dalada Maligawa having

fraudulently shown the value of the elephant imported from Burma as

Rs. 261,592,500/- has committed a fraud involving foreign currency

(v) It appears that thereby that person has committed an offence in terms of

foreign currency regulations, custom regulations and the Penal Code of

Sri Lanka

(vi) Although time has lapsed an investigation must be conducted by

customs, central bank, the controller of exchange and the police

(vii) It is the responsibility of the department of wildlife which issued the

permit to make complaints to the police, customs and to the treasury

(viii) To avoid liability there should have been a good coordination between

wildlife conservation ministry, department of import and export (ministry

of finance) which issues import permits and the department of customs

and after investigating the loss caused to the country money should be

recovered from him

(ix) Further if he has committed an offence involving fraudulent

embezzlement of public funds he should be punished with imprisonment,

either under exchange control laws or the penal code of Sri Lanka

The above is the English rendering of P. 54.

It is signed by the member of the one man committee.

It is dated 25.05.2016.

The report P. 54 is attached to a letter dated 23.11.2017 signed for the secretary

of the ministry of sustainable development and wild life under the Right to

Information Act No. 12 of 2016.

It is addressed to Pradeep Nilanga Dela.

He is the petitioner.

P. 51 is a letter written by the petitioner on 09.11.2017.

It is addressed to the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs.

The letter refers to a complaint made by one R. S. P. B. Senanayake of

Peradeniya in respect of functions of Sri Dalada Maligawa.

It requests, to provide the petitioner with, the matters submitted by the

complainant to the inquiry; and the determination of the Commissioner

General thereof, if an inquiry has been held.

P. 51 refers to two tuskers donated to Sri Dalada Maligawa.

Sri Dalada Maligawa is the Temple of the Tooth, in Kandy. The petitioner is the

Diyawadana Nilame or the lay custodian of the tooth relic.

P. 53, P.52 and P.51 shows, that, the petitioner was unaware of any

proceedings or inquiry held in respect of an allegation against him or involving

him the nature of which was referred to above.

The following is what the petition in this case dated 02nd March 2018 say,

64 The Petitioner states that notwithstanding all of the above most clear

circumstances, more than 10 years after the said two tuskers arrived in

Sri Lanka, he came to know, to his utter shock, surprise, dismay, pain of

mind and embarrassment, , through newspaper articles published in the

Sunday Times and the Ada e-paper on 22nd of October 2017 and the

Lankadeepa, Lankadeepa online, the Lakbima and the Ada newspapers on

23rd of October 2017 that, a one man committee comprising of the 8th

8 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

Respondent abovenamed, appointed by the 4th Respondent, the then

Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Hon Gamini

Jayawickrama Perera had most outrageously and recklessly, reported that

the two elephants have been imported for the Dalala Maligawa claiming a

higher value than the market price and that a fredulent invoice had been

generated, to that amount and that money had been sent out of the

country, illegally.

..

67. The Petitioner did not have intimation about the Inquiry or

Proceedings. It was only after the Newspaper Articles of 22 10.2017 (the

Sunday Times and the Ada e Paper) and 23.10.2017 (the Lankadeepa and

the Lankadeepa online, the Lakbima, the Ada newspaper) were published,

that he became aware of the purported Inquiry that was said to have been

conducted by the one man committee comprising of the 8th Respondent.

The said Inquiry was with regard to some other issue of mismanagement

of the records, but in that process, this matter has also been contrived to

have been inveigled into the same, based on utterly false evidence given by

the 6th Respondent and most disturbingly, without any form of recourse

to the petitioner, who is the aggrieved party by sucn an irresponsible and

grievously illegal process.

68. Immediately upon seeing the said news reports, the petitioner sent a

clarification to the media and this was carried on 24.10,2017 in the Ada

Newspaper, the Daily News newspaper, the Rivira newspaper, the Lakbima

newspaper, the Mawbima newspaper, the Island and on 26.10.2017, in

the Daily Mirror Newspaper.

69. Thereafter, the 7th Respondent abovenamed, R.S.P.B. Senanayake,

contrived to hold a press conference on or about 25.10.17 and stated that

he has made a complaint to the 10th Respondent, the Commissioner

General of Buddhist Affairs requesting him to suspend the Petitioner from

9 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

his office as the Diyawadana Nilame and to commence an inquiry and a

purported contention portraying false information by the 6th respondent,

was carried in the Divaina and the Dinamina newspapers on 26.10,17 and

in the Lakbima, the Lankadeepa The Island, the Mawbima newspapers on

27.10.17.

70. The petitioner states that the 7th Respondent contested the Position

of Diyawadana Nilame in 2005 and he secured only 5 votes and in 2015,

he Couldn't even find any person to propose his name. Thus, he is a

disaffected, mischief maker with a collateral personal agenda.

71. The Petitioner further states that the Divaina on 26.10.17 and the

Lakbima, the Lankadeepa and the Mawbima newspapers on 27. 10.17

("P42", "P44", P45" and "P47" annexed hereto) also carried a media release

by the Petitioner that the Petitioner will be forced to take legal action

against those who made false allegations against him.

72. The petitioner obtained a copy of the Letter dated 24.10.17 of the 7th

Respondent, written to the 10th Respondent, Commissioner General of

Buddhist Affairs, which was mentioned in the aforesaid newspaper

articles, marked "P42", "P44", "P45" and "P47". The said letter of the 7th

Respondent had evern most mischievously been copied, in a bid to do

maximum damage, H.E. the President, H.E. the Prime Minister, the Hon

Minister of Foreign Affairs and Justice and the Hon. Attorney General and

had requested a suspension the Petitioner from the office of Diyawadana

Nilame.

73. It had been contended most falsely and wrongfully and disgracefully,

that the petitioner had utilized Dalada Magawa or Government funds for

the aforesaid amount of Rs. 261,592,500/- stated in the said purported

invoices mentioned in the Report of the 8th Respondent. There was also

imputation of criminal liability made in respect of the same.

At this stage, it is pertinent to consider the submissions made by Mr. Mohan

Gopallawa Senior Deputy Solicitor General on 04.10.2023 and the contents of

the written submissions filed on behalf of the respondents he represented, 1st to

6th, 10th and 11th who are,

1. D. Nanayakkara, Secretary of the Ministry of Sustainable Development

and Wildlife

In his stead A. P. G. Kithsiri has been substituted.

2. J. A. K. N. Jayathunge, Additional Secretary of the above ministry

P. H. Ananda substituted.

3. Ravindra Samaraweera, Minister of the above.

Sarath Fonseka substituted.

3. Gamini Jayawikrema Perera, former Minister of above.

4. R. M. D. B. Meegasmulla, former secretary of the above ministry.

5. K. V. R. Samantha Gunasekera

10. Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs

11. Dr. R. H. S. Samarathunge, Secretary to the Treasury.

The above respondent represented by the state for whom the learned S. D. S. G.,

appeared, have taken a stance of defending P.54, the findings of the one man

committee report.

In fact the written submissions of the one man member of the committee, the

former Judge of the Supreme Court, represented by Mr. Sumedha

Mahawanniarachchi, who made oral submissions on 08.11.2023 has taken up

the position in his written submissions that P. 54 is only the two pages of the

report compiled by the 08th respondent and in it there is no reference to the

11 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

petitioner and the final recommendation in it is in reference to the Import

Controller and not to the petitioner. (paragraphs 07 and 08).

The official respondents, except the 6th, represented by Mr. Gopallawa too agree

that P.54 is not the whole report. Because their written submissions at

paragraph 15 says that the report is not solely about the petitioner, that it is a

report of 63 pages; and the only part relevant to the petitioner is pages 62 and

63 (which is marked as document P. 54 of the petition). So these official

respondents, except for the unofficial one as 6th respondent accept, that, P. 54

represents the pages relevant to the petitioner. The rest not relevant to the

petitioner. So the petitioner need not mark the rest. He can come to court

marking only P.54. Hence the allegation that the petitioner attempted to mislead

the court, at paragraph 07 of the written submissions for the 08th respondent

(represented by Mr. Mahawannioarachchi) is unwarranted to say the least. The

petitioner is not asking for a writ in rem1, his concern, naturally, is about his

rights and his reputation.

There is also a matter to be taken into account by this Court, which is revealed

by the submissions made for the respondents represented by Mr. Gopallawa, S.

D. S. G.; and Mr. Mahawanniarachchi. That is,

(i) The learned counsel for the 08th respondent argues, that, although the

petitioner was not personally noticed to appear (so this is admitted for

the 08th respondent) the public was made aware of the inquiry held by

the 08th respondent by publishing in the newspapers that those who are

interested concerned or affected had a right to come before the committee

(paragraph 05)

(ii) The learned S. D. S. G., submits that the issue of permits with regard to

domesticated elephants is an ongoing public question as there are

discrepancies and irregularities in respect of the conditions to the issue

of the permits and it is to investigate that a one man committee

1 If there is one, that is

12 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

comprising of a former judge of the Supreme Court was appointed, to

investigate into the malpractices in respect of granting of permits to

import domesticated elephants (paragraph 08)

(iii) The learned S. D. S. G., further submits, that, hence the investigation

was not confined to the activities of the petitioner but relates to a larger

public question and hence upon a cabinet memorandum dated

04.12.2015 submitted by the minister of Sustainable Development and

Wildlife that committee was appointed (paragraph 09)

The above (i) (ii) and (iii) must be considered together.

So the one man committee was appointed to investigate into malpractices

committed in importing elephants to Sri Lanka.

If they had published, as they say, a newspaper advertisement, that was, then,

about importation of these wild beasts into this country violating import

regulations, etc.

So why should the petitioner be concerned? Why should he think that he is

affected? Why should he be interested? (the words used in paragraph 05 in (i)

above).

He does not represent the whole of Sri Lanka, or any part thereof for that

matter, but, only the Dalada Maligawa (the temple of the tooth) in Kandy. And

according to him, the two tuskers were not imported by him for the temple, but

they were donated from a foreign country.

If the above respondents position is accepted, there must be a proposition in

administrative law, that, if the allegations are of general nature; and as they

say a public question (issue) or a larger public question (issue), then having

published an advertisement in newspapers that the matter is being

investigated, any particular adverse finding could be reached, without notifying

that party; and or giving him an opportunity of being heard in his defence. For

example if importing narcotics to the country is a larger public question; and

13 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

on conducting a public inquiry on that, if a person comes before the committee

and gives evidence against a specific person or an institution, then, without

that person or the representative of that institution being heard, adverse

findings could be arrived at, because the mandate of the committee is not to

investigate about that person only, but about any person suspected of; and that

person is also one of the suspects.

There is no such proposition in administrative law, as the examination of

authorities would show.

4. The above respondents (both sets) also argue, that, P.54 was only a fact

finding inquiry report, that it cannot be quashed; and it only leads to some sort

of formal proceedings at which a hearing would be given (paragraph 09 of 08th

respondents written submission).

The 6th respondent (as per the report P.54) has provided evidence that the

elephants imported by the Dalada Maligawa in 2007 have been effected

pursuant to a payment of Rs. 261,592, 500?- which is twice the market value

of an elephant which ranges (the written submissions of respondent

represented by the Attorney General

So, there was evidence. The committee acted on that evidence. Must not the

committee before recommending various actions, most of which are of drastic

in nature, hear the relevant person?

The written submissions of the petitioner were received by this Court somewhat

late, one reason that this judgment could not be given before this. It starts by

saying, Mr. Jayawardane made very comprehensive oral submissions

before.Court.

Whereas his well expressed grace of language added beauty to the proceedings

of this Court, it is the substance, or the elements of the principle on which his

submission is based, not the form, or the vehicle that transported it, that

becomes the subject of cognizance of this Court.

14 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

The Latin maxim audi alteram partem, translating to "listen to the other side"

or "let the other side be heard as well," represents a foundational principle of

natural justice and due process in legal systems worldwide. Its invocation

ensures that all parties involved in a dispute receive an equitable opportunity

to present their case before a decision is made. This part of the judgment will

explore the historical and literary applications of this principle, coupled with

an introduction to authoritative decided cases that have shaped its

interpretation and application in the realms of law and society.

At the core of many legal systems is the belief in fair hearing. The maxim audi

alteram partem embodies this belief, asserting that no person should be judged

without a fair chance to present their side of the story. This principle is

intrinsically linked to the notion of justice; it reflects a commitment to

impartiality and fairness in adjudicating disputes. Since ancient times,

societies have recognized the importance of this principle in various forms,

ensuring that decisions are made only after all evidence and arguments have

been considered.

Historical records are replete with examples of the audi alteram partem

principle. In Ancient Greece, the Athenian democracy was renowned for its

public courts, where litigants would have the opportunity to make their case to

citizen juriesthe dikasteria2. The Romans, too, incorporated this concept in

their legal system, and it was during this period that the expression audi

alteram partem originated.

Literary works often serve as a reflection of the values and principles of a

society. The idea that every voice deserves to be heard is vividly encapsulated

2 This system was comprised of three separate institutions: the ekklesia, a sovereign governing body that wrote laws and dictated foreign policy; the boule, a council of representatives from the ten Athenian tribes and the dikasteria, the popular courts in which citizens argued cases before a group of lottery-selected jurors. Although this Athenian democracy would survive for only two centuries, its invention by Cleisthenes, The Father of Democracy, was one of ancient Greeces most enduring contributions to the modern world. The Greek system of direct democracy would pave the way for representative democracies across the globe. https://www.history.com/topics/ancient-greece/ancient-greece-democracy

in the Bards play, "The Merchant of Venice". Shakespeare presents a dramatic

courtroom scene where Shylock, though vilified, is given the platform to argue

for his bond, embodying the audi alteram partem principle. Despite Shylock's

ultimate defeat, the process underscores the significance of a fair hearing.

The maxim has been crystallized in the legal annals through its citation in

numerous judicial decisions. One landmark case that reaffirmed its importance

is Ridge v. Baldwin (1964). In this case, the House of Lords held that a police

chief constable wrongfully dismissed without a proper hearing had his audi

alteram partem rights infringed.

Another pivotal instance is provided by the European Court of Human Rights

in the case of Al-Nashif v. Bulgaria (2002). Although the maxim audi alteram

partem did not directly applied, in ECtHR - Al- Nashif v Bulgaria, Application

no. 50963/99, 20 September 2002, The Court found that a minimum

requirement of an effective remedy (even where there is an allegation of a threat

to national security) is that the competent independent appeals authority must

be informed of the reasons grounding the deportation decisions even if those

decisions are not publicly available. The authority must be allowed to reject the

executives assertion that there is a threat to national security where it finds it

arbitrary or unreasonable3.

In the Commonwealth, the principle was further enforced in Osmond v. Public

Service Board of New South Wales (1986), (Public Service Board of New South

Wales v Osmond [1986] HCA 7; 159 CLR 656; 60 ALJR 209; 63 ALR 559) in

which the High Court of Australia held that there is no general duty to provide

reasons for administrative decisions4, but this ruling has been subject to

3 https://www.asylumlawdatabase.eu/en/content/ecthr-al-nashif-v-bulgaria-applciation-no-5096399-20-september-2002 4 The High Court of Australia said, With the greatest respect to the learned judges in the majority in the Court of Appeal, the conclusion which they have reached is opposed to overwhelming authority. There is no general rule of the common law, or principle of natural justice, that requires reasons to be given for administrative decisions, even decisions which have been made in the exercise of a statutory discretion and which may adversely affect the interests, or defeat the legitimate or reasonable expectations, of other persons. That this is so has been recognized in the House of Lords (Sharp v Wakefield [1891] AC 173 at 183; Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and

16 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

criticism and has been greatly qualified by the introduction of statutory duties

to give reasons in subsequent years5. Although Matthew Groves, the writer

referred to in fn.4, attempts to imply that reasons are not absolute, there is, as

this Court sees, a fundamental link between reasons and the maxim audi

alteram partem.

The object of judicial process is arriving at the correct decision. The decision

maker should have an objective mind. This is twofold. He or she must be open

in mind so as to allow the free inflow of all facts and circumstances the presence

of which is necessary to arrive at the right decision. He or she must also have

an unfettered ability to discern good from evil. This is the ability to take

independent and unbiased decisions. But it goes deeper. Ability to discern good

from evil is not what anybody and everybody think good and evil, for it could

be different from one person to another. This stands on a harder surface than

Food [1968] AC 997 at 1032-33, 1049, 1050-54 and 1061-62) and the Privy Council (Minister of National Revenue v Wrights' Canadian Ropes, Ltd [1947] AC 109 at 123); in those cases, the proposition that the common law does not require reasons to be given for administrative decisions seems to have been regarded as so clear as hardly to warrant discussion. More recently, in considered judgments, the Court of Appeal in England has held that neither the common law nor the rules of natural justice require reasons to be given for decisions of that kind: R v Gaming Board; Ex parte Benaim [1970] 2 QB 417 at 430-31; Payne v Lord Harris [1981] 1 WLR 754 at 764 ; 2 All ER 842 at 850-51. It has similarly been held that domestic tribunals are not bound to give reasons for their decisions; see McInnes v Onslow-Fane [1978] 1 WLR 1520 ; 3 All ER 211 and earlier authorities collected in Pure Spring Co Ltd v Minister of National Revenue [1947] 1 DLR 501 at 534-5 The contrary view appears to have been expressed by Lord Denning MR in Breen v Amalgamated Engineering Union [1971] 2 QB 175, but that was a dissenting judgment and if it was intended to suggest that reasons must be given for the decision of a statutory or domestic body whenever the circumstances make it fair to do so it is inconsistent with R v Gaming Board; Ex parte Benaim, in which the judgment of the court was written by Lord Denning MR himself, and with Payne v Lord Harris, a decision to which Lord Denning MR was a party. https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/print?DocID=JUD%2F9ALNN85%2F00001 5 In Public Service Board of NSW v Osmond (1986) 159 CLR 656, the High Court held that there is no general duty to provide reasons for administrative decisions. The rule in Osmond has been criticised by scholars and greatly qualified by the introduction of statutory duties to give reasons. This Before the High Court examines the rule established in Osmond, the case for and against a general common law duty to provide reasons, and the various statutory duties to provide reasons. It also considers the recent law of several other common law jurisdictions, by which the courts have recognised limited duties to provide reasons for administrative decisions. The pending case of Wingfoot Australia Partners Pty Ltd v Kocak [2013] HCA Trans 105 (Kocak), for which special leave was granted on 10 May 2013, provides an occasion for limited but important change to the law.

it may appear because it is so connected with the rationality of human mind.

It may be called first principles or fundamental principles but whatever it may

be called it is that which arises by cause following effect, reason.

Hence the reason or the basis for the existence of the maxim audi alteram

partem is to allow the free inflow of all relevant information, on which; and on

which only, a correct decision can be made.

In addition to these cases, the principle remains alive in literature, as evidenced

in "To Kill a Mockingbird6," Harper Lees seminal work set against the backdrop

of racial injustice. The character of Atticus Finch, while defending Tom

Robinson, exemplifies the essence of audi alteram partem, pleading for the jury

to listen to both sides without prejudice, albeit in an atmosphere of deep-seated

bias.

The significance of the maxim audi alteram partem cannot be overstated. Both

historically and in modern jurisprudence, this principle safeguards individuals

against the miscarriage of justice. It is not merely a procedural requirement but

an ethical commandment that validates the essence of human dignity in the

adjudicative process. While the examples from both history and literature

reveal the challenges in realizing this ideal in practice, they also underline its

perpetual relevance.

Across ages and cultures, the audi alteram partem rule has been an enduring

beacon of justice, underscoring the belief that fairness cannot be achieved

without lending an ear to all those affected by the laws reach. As depicted in

6 To Kill a Mockingbird is a significant novel by Harper Lee that explores themes of racial injustice and moral growth. In the story, the jury plays a crucial role in the trial of Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Despite clear evidence of his innocence and a compelling defense by Atticus Finch, the all-white jury convicts Tom Robinson, reflecting the deep-seated racial prejudices of the time123. The jurys decision is a pivotal moment in the book, highlighting the societal issues of the American South during the Great Depression and serving as a catalyst for the protagonist Scouts understanding of the complexities of human nature and justice. https://www.britannica.com/topic/To-Kill-a-Mockingbird; https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/section10/; https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/summary/

literature and realized in courtrooms, this maxim remains a cornerstone of fair

play and equity, imperative for a society founded on principles of justice,

equality and the Rule of Law.

Prior to coming to the reasons adduced for the petitioner, that, he was in no

way involved in importing elephants violating import regulations and or

committing an exchange fraud, for this Court considers, not only the

application of the above maxim, but also the factual basis too; and further

examine cases cited in respect of the maxim for the petitioner, a part of the final

address by Mr. Jayawrdane, Presidents Counsel to the court on behalf of the

petitioner (from the transcript of the proceedings) is reproduced, for this Court

thinks, that it should be preserved.

art thou? Hast thou not eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that

thou shouldst not eat?' And the same question was put to Eve also8.

SLT asked for the quashing of the recommendation of the Human Rights

Commission. The state took the objection that this is only a

recommendation that it does not attract writ. Justice Sri Skandharajah

upheld that objection. Supreme Court said the Court of Appeal was wrong

and cited the 05 judge Bench case of G. P. A. de Silva vs. Sadiq of

as it adopted principles of fairness.

9 The monarch of England in 1723 was George I1. He reigned from 1714 to 17272. During his reign, the power of the monarchy diminished and the modern system of government by a cabinet developed under the leadership of the first Prime Minister, Robert Walpole. 10 Rhadamanthus is perhaps most famous for his role in the afterlife.

questions affecting rights. It is not essential that the body should

be established by Statute (provided it is not merely a private or

domestic tribunal) or that the rights must necessarily be rights

which are enforceable by action.

(iv) Before any lawfully constituted body arrives at a finding in respect

of any person, it is necessary that such body should give a fair

hearing to the person concerned. The principle audi alteram

partem is one that is widely applicable.

The learned Presidents Counsel also submitted, that, the writ court can quash

a decision which is only a mere step in a process that .alters his legal position

into a disadvantage (Judicial Remedies in Public Law Lewis at page 136) and

referred to what he called the watershed case of Amaradasa vs. Land Reforms

arriving in Sri Lanka to be donated to the Dalada Maligawa is depicted in the

following passages in the petitioners written submissions.

15. In these circumstances, most irresistibly, Your Lordship would see the reliefs sought by the

Petition dated 02/03/2018, should necessarily granted ex debito justitiae, with regard to that PORTION OF THE 8TH RESPONDENTS REPORT WHICH IS CONTAINED IN P-54, PER SE, WHICH RELATES TO THE PETITIONER.

16. The Petitioner does not seek to do any violence to the rest of the report of the 8th respondent,

which deals with matters not concerning the Petitioner and confined his reliefs only to P-54, which is the purported adverse and prejudicial findings of the Petitioner.

17. In fact, the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs in his Statement of Objections, duly

and correctly admits the receipt of the communication from the Sri Dalada Maligawa, produced marked P-51, which shows the due interposition of the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs in this nationally important process on a Government to Government basis. 18. The 6th Respondent in his Objections makes a pathetic and most despicable attempt to

mislead Your Lordships Court and he annexes the Customs Declarations 6R1 and 6R-1 and attempts to portray an exorbitant amount has been paid for these elephants. 19. We invite Your Lordships attention to the counter affidavit of the Petitioner 24/10/2021,

where the Petitioner has clearly pointed out in paragraph 30(i) as follows:-

in any event, I also state that both Customs Declarations produced marked 6R-1 and 6R-2, in cage No. 28, most categorically states as follows:- No foreign exchange involved 20. We invite Your Lordships Court attention to the said Customs Declaration 6R-1 and 6R-2

and to page 28 thereof ( which was highlighted to Your Lordships during oral submissions), which expressly states:-

No foreign exchange involved 21. This is obviously so because the documents from P-1 onwards shows that this was a gift

arranged from Government to Government basis from Myanmar in order to foster and strengthen Buddhist religion and to show good will to Sri Lanka and in reverence to the Sri Dalada Maligawa, which consecrates the Tooth Relic and is one of the chief places of veneration and worship in Sri Lanka and Internationally as well.

22. In any Customs Declaration there is a pro forma requirement of placing the value even

whether its zero rated and even whether no payments have been made with regard to a gift. This is only purely for the purpose of the record.

23. We draw Your Lordships Court attention to several sub-paragraphs (a) to (e) of paragraph

30, in pages 18 and 19 of the counter affidavit.

24. We respectfully submit that quite apart from the Petitioner not being noticed and not been

duly offered an opportunity of being heard, in respect of this spurious complaint, the Petitioner was never made aware of any adverse material against him and if the Petitioner had been granted this opportunity, the Petitioner would have empathically refuted this complaint by demonstrating all the large number of documents which he had in his possession, which demonstrates that this was a gift to the country.

It is also pertinent to note, that, the petitioners written submissions, in

explaining documents P.01 to P.12 states, as follows,

1. The following documents unequivocally prove this:-

A. In the 2nd paragraph of P-1, it is evident that the intervention of the Sri Lanka Ambassador

for Myanmar had interposed himself as part of a meritorious deed through the donation of the tuskers by Myanmar and that he had stipulated that it should be facilitated through the ministry of foreign affairs of Sri Lanka. The title of the document is request for donation of tuskers B. P-2 the official letter shows the intervention of Sri Lanka embassy in Myanmar with the foreign

Ministry of the Government of Myanmar and to the Minister of foreign affairs of Myanmar. C. P-3 is the official communication by Sri Lankan embassy in Myanmar, issued by none other

than Mr. Arthur Samaraseke Presidents Counsel, then Ambassador to Myanmar, addressed to the Secretary, Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka, referring to the Sri Lankan Embassys communication of Yangon, of the Government of Myanmar. D. Your Lordships would see the notation at the bottom of P-3, vide at lines 5 and 6, where it

clearly states from Sri Lankas officials to his Excellency. The ambassador that Myanmar has agreed to donate, one elephant to Sri Lanka.

E. P-5 is the official communication under the letter head of the Government of the Union of

Myanmar- Ministry of Foreign Affairs, addressed to SL embassy, which at 2nd paragraph states:- the Ministry accordingly has the honour to inform that the authorities concerned of the Union of Myanmar has agreed to the said request. The Embassy has advised to choose the two tuskers amongst the 5 tuskers which have been gathered at the Hlawga park. F. P-5 is an official communication by Sri Lanka ambassador in Myanmar to Secretary, Ministry

of Foreign affairs in Sri Lanka intimating that the Ministry of for affairs of Myanmar that the relevant authorities of Myanmar have agreed to grant the 2 tuskers to the Maligawa. G. P-6 is the official communication where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sri Lanka, officially

invites the Petitioner as the Diyawadana Nilame of the Dalada Maligawa, to visit Myanmar to select the suitable tuskers. H. P-7 is the follow- up letter in that connection under the letter head of the Maligawa to his

I. P-8- press notice showing pictorially the minister of religious of Myanmar receiving the

religious delegation led by the Petitioner at the religious affairs ministry of Myanmar and where Myanmars deputy Minister and the DG of Religious affairs and DG of Promotion and propagation of Sasana were all officially present. J. P-9 is an official letter addressed by the Ambassador of Sri Lanka, Mr. Excellency, Mr. Arthur

Samarasekere PC, in his letter titled donation of two tusker elephants to the temple of tooth Sri Lanka and thanking Myanmar, its agreement to donate elephants to Sri Lanka and proposing that:- may I suggest that the actual making of the donation be timed to coincide with the visit of H.E the Prime Minister of Union of Myanmar to Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister of Sri Lanka has already extended the necessary invitation for such visit. If the visit is taking place, it may be possible to arrange the actual handing over of the two tusker elephants to be made at Kandy itself on that occasion

In the very top of the 2nd page of P-9 refers to the very great meritorious act of not only of Sri Lanka of all the people of Sri Lanka and that one day these tuskers would carry the golden Casket of the venerated Tooth Relic during the Annual Pageant held in Kandy.

26 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

K. P-10 is the official letter from the Sri Lankan Embassy to the Myanmars Ministry of Foreign

Affairs, arranging the logistics of the transport of the elephants from Myanmar to Sri Lanka. L. P-11 is the official approval of the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs of the expenditure of

Rs. 150,000 for the relevant air fare. M. P-12 is the official communication by the ministry of Forestry of the government of Myanmar

addressed to Sri Lanka embassy stating inter alia :-

at the request of the Government of Sri Lanka, the Government of the Union of Myanmar is now ready to donate the 2 full blown elephants

2. Surely, Your Lordships Court would see most irresistibly that if the petitioner was noticed and

afforded a hearing by this Cabinet appointed Committee this document and the other documents would have proved beyond doubt that this was a Government to Government donation and WAS NOT A PRIVATE PURCHASE OF THE MALIGAWA. It is nothing short of (pardon the colloquial phrase) scary that in this day and age, such decisions in the nature of P-54 can be grievously be made against a citizen, without noticing and hearing that citizen and then contriving to arrive at very perfunctory precipitous and regrettably nave findings, unsustained by proper material.

A. P-13 shows all the logistical arrangements that were made;

B. P-15 expressly refers to the donation of the 2 tuskers; C. P-17 which is the official clearance issued by the Department of Wildlife of Sri Lanka at

cages 5 to specimens to be imported as DONATION FOR RELIGIOUS PURPOSES TO THE MALIGAWA; D. P-18 onwards are also several official communications between the two governments; E. P-20(c) is the international animal certificates, which is the CITIES permit, 3. And number of several other documents , each of which were duly examined during the oral submissions.

Hence it is clear as clear can be, that,

(i) The petitioner did not import any elephant (tusker) or elephants as

alleged in 2007

(ii) Thus the petitioner was not involved in any foreign exchange fraud or

any other violation of any law, rule or regulation pertaining to the

importation of flora and fauna

In respect of the proposition, that, there exists a right to know the opposing

case, the petitioner refers to following cases, [among other things not quoted

here]

Capital Trust Holdings Limited Vs Securities and Exchange Commission

CA/WRIT/465/2022, CAM 12.12.2023,

I take the view that this Court should be guided with the following words

of Lord Denning reflected in the Writ Remedies; Remediable Rights Under

Public Law (by Justice B.P. Banerjee, 7th Edition, at page 1093) upon

which the Petitioners have placed reliance:

One of the requirements of natural justice is that the objector should have

the opportunity to know and meet if the case made against him. Lord

Denning in Kanda v. Government of Malaya, (1962) AC 322 observed that

if the right to be heard is to be a real right which is worth anything it must

carry with it a right in the accused man to know the case which is made

against him. He must know what evidence has been given and the

statement has been made affecting him and then he must have been given

a fair opportunity to correct or contradict the same.

THE QURAN

In Surah An-Nisa (4:135), it states: "O you who have believed, be persistently

standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves

or parents and relatives." This verse underscores the importance of

upholding justice even when it may go against one's personal interests or

relationships. Additionally, the concept of 'Adl' (justice) is central in Islamic

teachings, emphasizing the need to treat all individuals fairly and with

dignity.

THE BIBLE

You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great

alike. You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for the judgment is Gods. And

the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.

Sharvananda J(as he then was) in Ittepana v. Hemawathie [1981](1) S.L.R. at

page 476] , observed that, The Principles of natural justice are the basis

of our laws of procedure

[This Court is of the view that the principles of natural justice go beyond mere

procedure and it is the basis of the Rule of Law. Laws of procedure are only a

reflection of the Rule of Law]

In Amaradasa V. LRC, 79 NLR 505, the Supreme Court has most

emphatically upheld that a persons right to be heard is entrenched in the

principles of natural justice as well as forms part and parcel of administrative

law principles, failure to adhere to which, would render such decision, a

nullity.

Sundakaran Vs. Bharathi [1989] 1 SLR 46, Justice A.R.B. Amarasinghe held that

:-

If the principles of natural justice are violated in respect of any decision

it is, indeed, immaterial whether the same decision would have been

arrived at in the absence of the essential principles of justice. The

decision must be declared no decision. "

Sarath Amunugama and Others Vs Karu(narathne) Jayasuriya, Chairman,

United National Party and others [2000] 1 SLR 172, the Supreme Court

held that . whatever the uncertainty inherent in the phrase, natural

justice connotes, above all, the maxim audi alteram partem. What is the

fuss about natural justice and the right to a fair hearing about? The right

to a hearing has been accepted as a basic principle in many civilizations

and over many years. In Greece, the requirement of hearing both sides

before reaching a conclusion formed a part of the Athenian judicial oath

and is referred to by Aristophanes, Euripedes and Demosthenes.. As

might be expected, in Sri Lanka too matters were adjudicated after hearing

both sides: ubhaya paksayen ma adyanta asa ganna dadek da says the

Saddharmarathnavaliya. . As far as the law is concerned, we have in

Sri Lanka in this area closely followed the common law which, from

very early times, recognized the right to a fair hearing., prior to

making a decision which affect rights of parties.

[3rd February, 2000 AMERASINGHE, ACTING C.J.]

Ranjith Flavian Wijeratne vs Asoka Sarath Amarasinghe, in SC Appeal

40/2013, SCM 12/11/2015, the Supreme Court held as follows:-

In Russell v. Duke of Norfolk (1949) 1 All E.R. 109 Tucker L.J. observed

that one essential requirement in regard to the exercise of judicial and

quasi judicial powers is that the person concerned should have a

reasonable opportunity of presenting his case.

I am of the opinion that where the power is conferred in an administrative

body or tribunal which exercises power in making decisions which affect

the rights of persons, such body or tribunal should act according to the

principles of natural justice except in cases where such right is excluded,

either by express words or by necessary implication, by the legislature.

Lord Diplock in the case of OReilly v. Mackman (1983) 2 AC 237 at 276

held that the right of a man to be given a fair opportunity of hearing what

is alleged against him and of presenting his own case is so fundamental to

any civilized legal system that it is to be presumed that Parliament

30 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

intended that a failure to observe it should render null and void any

decision reached in breach of this requirement.

A tribunal exercising quasi judicial functions is not bound to adopt a

particular procedure in the absence of statutory provision. In some

situations the tribunals have to act within certain limits. However, it needs

to observe certain minimum standards of natural justice and fairness

when discharging its functions.

In the said case, it was further held as follows:

.. The failure of the Commissioner to afford the 1st Respondent an

opportunity of showing cause as to why the house should not be vested in

the Commissioner violates the principles of natural justice. Further, the

inquiry before the Commissioner is inquisitorial proceedings and, as such,

the burden is on the Commissioner to conduct the inquiry. Further, in the

absence of laid down procedure in the said Law the inquiry should be

conducted according to the principles of natural justice. Thus, the

Commissioners order is in violation of the principles of Natural Justice

which require that a party such as the 1st Respondent should have been

afforded an opportunity of being heard before any decision affecting his rights

was made by the Commissioner. Any decision given in breach of the rules of

natural justice is null and void and has no force in law.

Jayawardena V. Dharani Wijayatilake, Secretary, Ministry of Justice and

Constitutional Affairs And Others, ([2001]1 Sri L.R. 132), the Supreme

Court, held as follows:-

The legal principles are clear. In Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works it

was, laid down that "although there are no positive words in a statute,

requiring that the party shall be heard, yet the justice of the common law will

supply the omission of the legislature." In a passage which has repeatedly

31 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

been cited with approval, Lord Loreburn, LC, referred to the duty of public

bodies and officers when called upon to decide questions, even involving

discretion:

"In the present instance, as in many others, what comes for determination is

a matter to be settled by discretion, involving no law. It will, I suppose,

usually be of an administrative kind; but sometimes it will involve matter of

law as well as matter of fact, or even depend on matter of law alone. In such

cases [they] will have to ascertain the law and also to ascertain the facts. I

need not add that in doing either they must act in good faith and listen fairly

to both sides, for that is a duty lying upon every one who decides anything.

But I do not think they are bound to treat such a question as though it were

a trial. They have no power to administer an oath, and need not examine

witnesses. They can obtain information in any way they think best, always

giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for

correcting or contradicting anything prejudicial to their view." Board of

Education v Rice, [1911] AC 179.

Splendour Media (Pvt.) Limited vs Commissioner of Labour, CA (Writ)

Application No: 102/2017, CAM 1st November 2019, it was observed as

follows:-

The importance of natural justice and why Courts insist upon it are

captured by the following paragraphs in 'Administrative Law' by Wade:

"Just as the courts can control the substance of what public authorities do

by means of the rules relating to reasonableness, improper purposes, and so

forth, so through the principles of natural justice they can control the

procedure by which they do it. In so doing they have imposed a particular

procedural technique on government departments and statutory authorities

32 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

generally. The courts have, in effect, devised a code of fair administrative

procedure based on doctrines which are an essential part of any system of

administrative justice.

Procedure is not a matter of secondary importance. As governmental powers

continually grow more drastic, it is only by procedural fairness that they are

rendered tolerable. A judge of the United States Supreme Court has said:

'Procedural fairness and regularity are of the indispensable essence of liberty.

Severe substantive laws can be endured if they are fairly and impartially

applied. One of his colleagues said: 'The history of liberty has largely been

the history of the observance of procedural safeguards.

It is true that the rules of natural justice restrict the freedom of

administrative action and that their observance costs a certain amount of

time and money. But time and money are likely to be well spent if they reduce

friction in the machinery of government; and it is because they are essentially

rules for upholding fairness and so reducing grievances that the rules of

natural justice can be said to promote efficiency rather than impede it.

Provided that the courts do not let them run riot, and keep them in touch

with the standards which good administration demands in any case, they

should be regarded as a protection not only to citizens but also to officials.

Moreover, a decision which is made without bias, and with proper

consideration of the views of those affected by it, will not only be more

acceptable; it will also be of better quality. Justice and efficiency go hand in

hand, so long at least as the law does not impose excessive refinements.

Lalith Oeshapriya vs. Captain Weerakoon and Others, Marsoof, J/President

of the Court of Appeal (as he then was) held as follows :

33 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

"Even more serious is the violation of the two cardinal principles of natural

justice embodied in the maxims 'audi alteram partem' and 'nemo judex in

causa sua potest'. The first of these principles postulates a fair hearing before

the rights of a citizen are affected by a quasi judicial or administrative

decision. In this context, it is now recognised that 'qui aliquid statuerit parte

in audita altera acquum licet discerit, haud acquum fecerit' - which means

that he who determines any matter without hearing both sides, though he

may have decided right, has not done justice. According to the jurisprudence

built around the 'audi alteram partem' principal, there should not only be a

hearing of both sides, but the hearing should be more than a pretence. The

procedure followed should be fair and conducive to the achievement of

justice. In Board of Education v Ricell Lord Loreburn, L. C. in his famo us

dictum laid down that a tribunal was under duty to "act in good faith, and

fairly listen to bath sides for that is a duty lying upon everyone who decides

anything." In De Verteuil v Knaqqs it was laid down as follows: "In general,

the requirements of natural justice are first, that the person accused should

know the nature of the accusation made; secondly, that he should be given

an opportunity to state his case; and thirdly, that the tribunal should act in

good faith

In regard to the maxim audi alteram partem, this Court wishes to state further,

as follows,

In FALEEL v. SUSIL MOONESINGHE AND OTHERS 1994 (2) SLR 303,

Justice Ismail referred to the case of John vs. Rees. The latter, which is a

decision by Megarry J., in 1968 referred to Fortescue J., in his reference to

the God and Adam [and Eve]. In a series of Tea Board cases, where the

question was, whether the factory owners must be heard prior to suspending

the operations of the factory on allegations of the tea adulterated by excess

amounts of glucose [in these cases the Tea Board effected the suspension by

informing the brokers not to accept tea from the particular factory; and

34 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

informed the factory owner after 2 or more days] in which the Attorney

General cited Faleels case, in my judgments C. A. Writ 195 2020 dated

22.09.2022, C. A. Writ 196 2022 dated 03.05.2024 and C. A. Writ 198 2020

which incidentally will be given today, 10th May 2024, I have been referring

to the statement of Fortescue J.; and presently consider delving more on the

factual basis of Johns case.

Firstly, this is what Ismail J., said,

The submission on behalf of the petitioner is that there was no situation of

emergency, a critical situation, a destablising factor or a compelling reason

to resort to a holding operation by way of a suspension. Learned Counsel

referred to the judgment of Lord Denning M. R. in Lewis v. Hefer (3) in which

he used the term holding operation after quoting Megarry J. in John v. Pees

(4). It arose in this manner. In the course of the submissions in John v. Rees

it was the contention of the counsel for the plaintiff that the rules of natural

justice apply not only to expulsion or dismissal, but also to suspension from

office, and among the cases cited by him were Burn v. National Amalgamated

Labourers' Union of Great Britain and Ireland (5),.

Having examined a case decided by Denning L. J., too, which will be referred

to in due course, Ismail J., decided that as per the facts in that case a hearing

prior to the decision was not necessary.

But in John vs. Rees itself, [of which I have the original law report from the

Judges Library] Megarry J., decided, that, the rule audi alteram partem

should have been followed.

The facts were as follows,

On March 27, 1968, the Member of Parliament for Pembrokeshire, Mr.

Desmond Donnelly, was expelled from the Labour Party. Ten days later, on

April 6, the annual meeting of the Pembrokeshire Divisional Labour Party

(referred to as P.D.L.P.), took place. At the start of the meeting, Mr. James

35 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

Cecil Gough John, as president of P.D.L.P., took the chair. The meeting was

attended by about 100 people, mostly delegates from various local Labour

Parties within the constituency. After Mr. John had welcomed the delegates,

the assistant national agent of the Labour Party addressed the meeting on

loyalty to the party. He reminded members of their obligations, referred to

Mr. Donnelly's expulsion, and ended by suggesting that a resolution be

passed to the effect that P. D. L. P. should continue to act in strict conformity

with its constitution, and the rules and constitution of the Labour Party. No

such resolution appeared on the agenda and when Mr. John sought to put

such a resolution, which had been moved and seconded by delegates from

the floor, to the vote disturbances broke out, since the majority of those

present were supporters of Mr. Donnelly, and favoured disaffiliation from the

Labour Party. There was a certain amount of noise, disorder and, in a few

cases, bodily contact, but nothing that could really be called violence, and no

one appeared to have been put in fear. After some attempt to restore order,

Mr. John purported, as chairman, to adjourn the meeting sine die, and left

the meeting accompanied by a number of other delegates. Those who

remained proceeded with the business of the meeting, which included the

election of officers. Mr. Bartholomew Cleare was elected president, in place

of Mr. John, and Mr. Haydn J. Lewis was elected treasurer. Mr. Glyn Rees,

the secretary, remained secretary since his office was not amongst those to

be filled, In addition to other business, the meeting then passed, by 69 votes

to 1, a resolution to disaffliliate from the Labour Party. The validity of the

continuation of the meeting, after the purported adjournment, was

challenged by Mr. John, as plaintiff, in a writ issued on May 6, 1968 [1968

J. No. 2692],: and a notice of motion was issued on the same date, claiming

an injunction to restrain Mr. Rees, Mr. Cleare and Mr. Lewis (the first, second

and third defendants, respectively), from dealing in any way with the moneys

or other property of the P.D.L.P. Mr. John, the plaintiff, claimed to represent

all members of the P.D.L.P. other than the three defendants and also, to be

acting personally. [page 351 of John vs. Rees and others [1968 J. No. 2692];

Martin and another vs. Davis and others [1968 M No. 2390] and Rees and

another vs. John [1968 R. No. 2276] 1970 Chancery Division 345].

Meanwhile, on April 24, 1968, the National Executive Committee of the

Labour Party, hereinafter referred to as N.E.C., passed two resolutions, one

suspending the activities of the P.D.L.P., and the right of its officers to handle

the funds of the party, and the other authorising the national agent to take

such steps as are necessary to complete the reorganization of the P.D.L.P.

In pursuance of these resolutions the national agent resolved, inter alia, to

convene a meeting of the Haverfordwest Local Labour Party, but before doing

so he sent a letter by registered post to leading members of the dissident

faction who supported Mr. Donnelly, informing them of the proposed

reorganisation and requesting from them an undertaking that they accepted,

and would conform to, the constitution, programme, principles and policy of

the Labour Party, that they neither belonged to nor were actively associated

with any proscribed organization and that they would co-operate in re-

establishing the P.D.LP. in accordance with the rules and constitution of the

Labour Party. [page 352].

Among other things, one question for decision was, whether the National

Executive Committee should have heard the purportedly elected members of

the P. D. L. P., [after Mr. James Cecil Gough John, who was known as

Counsellor John since he was having 40 years of experience as an active

member adjourned the disorderly meeting sine die and left it] prior to making

the decision to suspend them.

Megarry J., said,

However that may be, what matters here is, in my judgment, not

the terminology but the substance and the reality: and looking at

37 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

that, it seems plain that the principles of natural justice prima facie

apply. Mr. Sparrow sought to avoid this conclusion by urging that what

was done bore generally on P.D.L.P. and was not directed against

individuals. He further contended that the principles of natural justice did

not apply because the acts were administrative, because there had been

no dismissal of any disaffiliates, and because these principles did not

apply to unpaid offices.

I do not find any of these contentions persuasiveA party or a

club if unincorporated is not an entity separate from its members; and

action against the collective unit takes direct effect against the individuals

comprising that unit. This seems to me to be quite different from the

indirect effect that a proposal for a new road may have on the individual

landowners, to which Lord Reid referred in Ridge vs. Baldwin [1964] A. C.

40 at page 72. On these submissions, as throughout, I look to the

realities and not to the labels. Further, without authority to support it,

I can see no warrant for the view that the application of the principles of

natural justice to dismissal or suspension should be withheld from

honorary office and yet accorded to ordinary membership. My reference to

the office of Treasurer of an Inn of Court was later to move Mr. Sparrow to

protest on the ground that the Inns were peculiar bodies. Indeed, they may

be; but there are many other offices, both honourable and honorary, in

other bodies; and unless constrained by authority (and none has been

cited) I refuse to hold that the right to natural justice depends upon the

right to a few pieces of silver.

Accordingly, I must consider what are the principles of natural justice

which prima facie are applicable, and whether or not there is anything

to oust their application. In doing this, it is convenient to refer to a case

concerning an avowed expulsion from a political party which came before

me some three weeks after the conclusion of the argument in this case,

38 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

namely, Fountaine v. Chesterton. It may be that there is other authority

on the point that I have in mind: but none was cited to me in that case or

in this. The decision was briefly reported in The Times of August 20, 1968

and 112 S. J. 690: but I gather from the asterisk attached to the latter

report that no full report is likely to appear, at any rate in the Weekly Law

Reports. Accordingly, it may be convenient if I set out as best I can from

my notes the passage in that judgment which I have in mind.

In that case I said: [Megarry J.,]

"The expression 'the principles of natural justice' is, I think, now

a technical term. As Maugham J. pointed out in Maclean v. Workers'

Union [1929] 1 Ch. 602, 624, among most savages there is no such

thing as justice in the modern sense. In a state of nature, self-interest

prevails over any type of justice known to civilisation; the law of the

jungle is power, not justice. Nor am I clear what the word 'natural'

adds to the word 'justice.' It cannot be intended to indicate the

antithesis of 'unnatural justice,' which would indeed be an odd

concept; I imagine that it is intended to suggest justice that is simple

or elementary, as distinct from justice that is complex, sophisticated

and technical.

The term 'natural justice' has often been used by eminent judges,

and although Maugham J. said (at p. 624) that it 'is, of course, used only

in a popular sense,' I would prefer to regard it as having become

something of a term of art. To extract the quintessence of the process

of justice is, indeed, notoriously difficult. 'The ideas of natural

justice,' said Iredell J., 'are regulated by no fixed standard; the ablest

and the purest men have differed on the subject': Calder v. Bull (1798)

3 U.S. 386, 399. In Ridge v. Baldwin [1964] A.C. 40, 132, Lord Hodson

referred to a 'certain vagueness' in the term, but rejected the view

that because the requirements of natural justice depended upon the

39 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

circumstances of the case, this made natural justice so vague as to

be inapplicable. He added: 'No one, I think, disputes that three

features of natural justice stand out - (1) the right to be heard by an

unbiased tribunal; (2) the right to have notice of charges of

misconduct; (3) the right to be heard in answer to those charges.' I do

not think that I shall go far wrong if I regard these three features as

constituting in all ordinary circumstances an irreducible minimum of

the requirements of natural justice. I need only add that all these

requirements are essentially procedural in nature; I regard natural

justice as a distillate of due process of law.

I then turned to consider a submission based on the judgment of

Denning L.J. in Lee v. Showmen's Guild of Great Britain [1952] 2 Q.B.

329, 342 to the effect that public policy would invalidate any

stipulation excluding the application of the rules of natural justice to

a domestic tribunal, and said that although I respectfully inclined to the

same view, it seemed to have been expressed obiter and was not

mentioned by the other members of the court, so that I would hesitate

to decide the case on that ground. I went on to refer to the rule which

was said to justify the expulsion, and then said:

"It is trite law that the rules of an unincorporated association form

a contract between all the members of that association. It is, indeed,

a somewhat special form of contract; but subject to that, what I am

required to do is to construe the terms of a contract. Where the

terms in issue deal with the exercise of a power of peremptory

suspension or termination of the rights of one of the parties to such

a contract, then I think that the common expectation of

mankind would be that the power would be exercised only in

accordance with the principles of natural justice unless the

contrary is made plain. This expectation rests upon high and

40 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

ancient authority. When a member of a university was deprived of

his degrees without being given an opportunity to defend himself,

Fortescue J. said: 'The laws of God and man both give the party an

opportunity to make his defence, if he has any. I remember to have

heard it observed by a very learned man upon such an occasion,

that even God himself did not pass sentence upon Adam, before he

was called upon to make his defence. Adam (says God) where art

thou? Hast thou not eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee

that thou shouldst not eat? And the same question was put to Eve

also': Rex v. Cambridge University (1723) 1 Stra. 557, 567. Even if

the law permits the principles of natural justice to be effectually

excluded by suitable drafting, I would not readily construe the

rules as having achieved this result unless they left me in no

doubt that this was the plain and manifest intention. Put a little

differently, I would say that if there is any doubt, the

applicability of the principles of natural justice will be given the

benefit of that doubt. The cry 'That isn't fair' is to be found from

earliest days, in nursery, street and school alike; and those who wish

to confer upon the committee or other governing body of a club or

association a power to act unfairly or arbitrarily in derogation of

common and universal expectation must make it plain beyond a per

adventure that this has been done. This view is, I think, at least

consistent with the approach of Romer L.J. in Lee v. Showmen's

Guild of Great Britain [1952] 2 Q.B. 329, 349, C.A. on a not

dissimilar point, where he said that it would require 'the use of clear

language' before he was satisfied that the members of any body such

as the trade union in question had agreed to leave the construction

of the trade union's rules to the committee, to the exclusion of the

courts.

41 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

Having now had the opportunity of reconsidering the language that I used

in that case, I must say that I can see no reason for resiling from it. Before

resorting to public policy, let the rules of the club or other body be

construed: and in the process of construction, the court will be slow

to conclude that natural justice has been excluded. Only if the rules

make it plain that natural justice was intended to be disregarded will it be

necessary for the courts to resolve the issue of public policy. In this case,

accordingly, I approach both clause 8 (2) of the Labour Party constitution

and the resolution of the N.E.C. dated April 24, 1968, as provisions

requiring to be construed strictly, and as not excluding the processes of

natural justice except in so far as this is made plain. Nothing that I can

see in clause 8 (2) even begins to exclude the process of natural justice.

The phrase "to take any action it deems necessary" cannot, in my

judgment, be read as if it continued "however contrary to natural

justice it may be"; nor, in my judgment, are the words "disaffiliation,"

"expulsion" or even "or otherwise" to be qualified in any such way.

These things may be done: but they must be done fairly and justly,

and not unfairly or unjustly.

not unfairly or unjustly. Accordingly, the first resolution, spending the

activities of the Pembroke Constituency Labour Party and depriving the

officers of the right for the time being to handle the funds of the party, falls

to be tested by the standard of whether it was made in accordance with

the rules of natural justice. Whatever may be said about the right to an

unbiased tribunal, the process of giving notice of the charges and giving

those concerned the right to be heard in answer to the charges was plainly

not followed. Accordingly, in my judgment the resolution was a nullity. It

was effective neither to suspend the activities of the Pembroke

Constituency Labour Party nor to deprive the officers of that party of their

right to handle the funds.

42 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

The two limbs of the second resolution, though directed to the same end,

are markedly different in function. The first is an operative decision that

the Pembroke Constituency Labour Party be re-organised." The second

provides that the national agent be given authority" to take such steps as

are necessary to complete the re-organisation" and so confers authority

on another to take certain steps. Both are very wide and indefinite in their

terms, depending on the protean word "re onganise. Plainly there is

considerable scope for argument about what that word means. But

whatever it means, I do not think it can be said to include a process which

excludes from the benefits of membership, without making a charge and

without affording a hearing, anyone who fails to sign return within a

reasonable time the form put forward in this case.

Mr. Sparrow did contend that sending out the form amounted to affording

the members an opportunity of being heard: but not even his considerable

powers of advocacy sufficed to give any life to as barren a contention as I

have heard. I cannot believe that the concept of "Write a letter in the form

I dictate, or you are out" would seriously be regarded by any of the great

judges who have spoken on the subject as making even an approach to

conformity with the requirements of natural justice; and the prospects of

this are not increased by the words "or you are out not being there but

being represented only by the hint to be derived from the reference to

making any recommendation to the National Executive Committee about

your continued membership of the party.

These are not days of linguistic accuracy. Euphemisms abound: and as I

said on a completely different subject in Pet Library (London) Ltd., vs.

Walter Ellson & Son Ltd., [1968] F.S.R. 359, 361, today

many words of precision are being weakened by

misapplication, sometimes for convenience but more often by

ignorance: words such as alibi and disinterested spring readily

43 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

to mind. There are also words which are persistently misused; thus

even in circles of high respectability (and I look with sorrow at Vol.

29 of Halsbury's Laws of England (3rd ed.) (1960), p. 646), the word

'escapees is sometimes applied to the fugitive prisoners rather than

the governor and prison officers that they left behind them."

Nevertheless, after making all due allowances for an age of semantic laxity

I do not think the word re organize can be held to comprehend a process

which in substance amounts to expulsion without a charge and without

an opportunity to meet it. The more indefinite the language, the less apt it

is to exclude the members reasonable expectation of being accorded

natural justice.

I also bear in mind the rule that, in general, a failure to give due notice of

a meeting to even one member of a body who is entitled to attend

invalidates the decisions of that body: see, for example, Smyth v. Darley

(I849) 2 H.L. Cas, 789, concerning the election of an officer, and Young v.

Ladies Imperial Club Ld. [1920] 2 K.B. S23 where an expulsion was in

issue. Here, no notice of the second meeting was given to a number of the

members of the local Labour Party: and it is clear that this was due not to

inadvertence or accident but to deliberation. It follows that the meeting

was not validly constituted, and so its proceedings were void. In the words

of Lord Campbell L.C. in Smyth v, Darley, at p. 803, "even a unanimous

election by those who did attend would be void,"

The next two passages which I will quote from the judgment of Megarry J., the

Vice Chancellor of Her Majesty the Queen, who among other great sayings of him

said, that, the most important person in a court is the litigant who is about to

lose; and the judgment must show why he lost, are extremely crucial and out of

the two, the first one, in addition, is monumental.

It may be that there are some who would decry the importance which

the courts attach to the observance of the rules of natural justice. When

44 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

something is obvious," they may say, why force everybody to go through

the tiresome waste of time involved in framing charges and giving an

opportunity to be heard? The result is obvious from the start. Those who

take this view do not, I think, do themselves justice. As everybody who has

anything to do with the law well knows, the path of the law is strewn with

examples of open and shut cases which, somehow, were not: of

unanswerable charges which, in the event, were completely answered: of

inexplicable conduct which was fully explained; of fixed and unalterable

determinations that, by discussion, suffered a change. Nor are those with

any knowledge of human nature who pause to think for a moment likely

to underestimate the feelings of resentment of those who find that a

decision against them has been made without their being afforded any

opportunity to influence the course of events.

Let me add this. What was done was, in my judgment, wrong; but there is

nothing before me to suggest that it was consciously wrong. I do not for

one moment say that the N.E.C. deliberately or knowingly resolved to

ignore the rules of natural justice. There is no evidence before me on the

point, but it may very well be that the thought never entered the minds of

the members of that committee. I am content to assume that the process

of getting round all problems relating to expulsion" was not the object of

the committee, but merely the contention of the advocate seeking, quite

properly, to make the best that he could of what had been done.

Nevertheless, however innocent the committee, what was done was wrong.

It follows that, subject to any argument that there may be about the

precise terms of the order, the plaintiffs are entitled to the injunctions

sought by the notice of motion.

inspectors was investigatory and not judicial, they must, in view of the

consequences which may follow from their report act fairly.

This directly applies in the present case. There cannot be fair action without

adhering to audi alteram partem.

It is pertinent, at this stage, to further consider the case of Rex vs. The University

of Cambridge or The King against The University of Cambridge from the original

law report. It is as follows,

CASE 94. THE KING against THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. [Referred to, Bonaker v. Evans, 1850, 16 Q. B. 171 ; Marquis of Abergavenny v. Bishop of Llandaff, 1888, 20 Q. B. D. 472.]

Time allowed to shew cause to a mandamus. A mandamus lies to restore a member of a university to doctor's degrees, from which he had been degraded by the University Court for speaking contemptuous words of the vice-chancellor, and of the process of the Court.-S. C. 2 Ld. Ray. 1334. S. C. Stra. 557. S. C. Fort. 202.

Mandamus to the vice-chancellor, masters, and scholars of Cambridge, to restore Dr. Bentley to the degrees to which he had been admitted by the university, and had been surreptiously degraded (as was suggested), or that they should shew cause why he should not be restored.

The counsel for the university desired time to shew cause why a mandamus should not go, for that there were several old books and charters which were necessary to be inspected before they could shew cause.

And thereupon the time was enlarged for that purpose.

And upon another day.

It was argued for the university, that by virtue of a charter given to them by Queen Elizabeth, they had a Court of Judicature to try and determine all matters arising within their jurisdiction, in which Court a plaint was levied by Dr. Middleton against Dr. Bentley, and thereupon a summons was sent by the beadle to the doctor, which he received, and spoke contemptuous words of the court, for which he was degraded, and from which no appeal would lie; no more than a writ of error would lie for imposing a fine by a Temporal Court for a contempt, because every Court of Record is entrusted with the final judgment of what shall be a contempt to their anthority; therefore if an appeal or a writ of error would lie in such case, it would put the trial of what is a contempt [149] to the discretion and judgment of a Superior Court, and to strip an Inferior Court of that power which they have by law to judge what is a contempt to them; whereas contempts of the authority of Courts are undoubtedly to be judged by the same Courts to whom the contempt is offered which is the reason that a writ of error will not lie on a sentence for a contempt to this Court ; but then it must be plainly proved. Now the same thing is done by a mandamus after an indirect manner as would have been done by an appeal or writ of error, if that would lie ; but as an appeal will not lie for a contempt, so neither will a mandamus ; for admitting this degradation

46 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

had been ad libitum, yet a Temporal Court could not grant a mandamus. It is like the case of a recorder of a corporation who was removeable at will, and being displaced moved for a mandamus, but it was denied. Besides, the constant course and custom of this university warrants a dis cretionary power amongst them to confer degrees on some, and to degrade others for any contempt; and in this case they have done all they could to bring Dr. Bentley to an easy agreement; for after the first summons they sent another in writing by their beadle, but the doctor's doors were then shut, and he would not be seen ; then they adjourned from day to day, on purpose to give him leave to appear, before they would suspend him ; but when he contemptuously declined, they first suspended and afterwards degraded him. Now as a mandamus was never yet granted to admit a man to a degree in the university, after he had performed all his exercises, so there ought to be none to restore one after a degradation, because degrees are arbitrarily given by the universities, and so are degradations arbitrarily made; for if they should by any means rashly admit an unlearned man to a degree, they may upon better information degrade him, without taking a traverse to the return of a mandamus, which must be tried by a jury of lay freeholders. Besides, these degrees are but titles of honour and precedency, and give no temporal right, and for that reason a mandamus ought not to go ; for if a knight should be degraded in a Court of Honour, no mandamus would lie to restore him (a), which is a case in point ; therefore if it should lie in this case, it would introduce a new method to evade [150] the privileges given by this charter, which was afterwards confirmed by Parliament; and as it hath been formerly adjudged in the case of Castle v. Litchfield (b), that a certiorari or writ of error will not lie to correct a judgment given for a contempt, so no mandamus ought to go, which is in effect the same. If it should be objected, that his degree qualifies him for some temporal employment, of which he would be incapable without it; now admitting that to be true, yet such employments are only consequential, and not directly incident to his degree, and therefore ought not to be regarded. And is another objection should be made, viz. that the doctor would have appeared by a proctor, but was not allowed so to do; though this may be true, yet it is no objection of weight, because it might not be the course of their court to admit such appearances, and the universities have a privilege to proceed according to their own laws, as an encouragement to learning; and if they have proceeded accordingly, this Court will not interpose. Now take the case as it stands upon Dr. Bentley's affidavit, there will be no reason to grant a mandamus; for he makes oath, that he has appealed from the sentence of the University Court; which if true, then there is another remedy for him to be restored, viz. by an appeal ; and where there is another remedy, a mandamus is never granted. Moreover the doctor made oath, that the university had no power to degrade him ; if so, then he is not degraded for want of a sufficient power so to do, and consequently a mandamus ought not to go, for it is impossible that a man should be restored to his degree who was never degraded.

But on the other side it was said, that the merits of this cause ought not to be argued upon a motion, but upon the return of the mandamus; and for that reason it ought to be granted.

The Court. All care shall be taken that justice shall be duly administered in the universities ; but if they assume an arbitrary power exempt from the jurisdiction of any other Court of Judicature, then they may do what they please without cotitroul , and where people are under such a government, they are in a very bad condition. But this Court hath a greater regard to the learning of the universities than to admit the arbitrary sentence of a vice-chancellor to be final. [151] As

47 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

to what has been said, that the degrees in the universities are only honorary ; this is a mistake, for they are blended with a temporal right so far as to deserve a mandamus to restore a mal degraded. It is true, this might have been a proper objection before the statutes of 21 Hen. 8, c. 13, and 13 & 14 Car. 2, c. 4, were made, which render a man incapable of a benefice if he had not taken his degrees in some university ; for before those statutes, such degrees were only titles of precedency, and the allowing them, or a degradation, was no temporal advantage or loss ; therefore in such case the Temporal Courts had no reason to interpose ; and this may be the reason why the universities degraded ad libitim, and of their constant course so to do. But this is no objection since the making those statutes. Neither shall it be said, that where a corporation has admitted a mal willingly to his freedom, that they shall have power to disfranchise him, because they do not like him ; neither can the universities give degrees to whom they please, and take them away ad libitum. AinI though their counsel have objected against this mandamus, for that they have an exempt and absolute jurisdiction amongst them selves, this seems to be a good reason why it should be granted, though it might have been otherwise if they had shewed that they had a visitor, to whom an appeal would lie ; for probably that might have excluded the superintendency of this Court; but to deny a degree to him who had performed all his exercises to qualify him for a degree, would be a great discouragement to learning; and in such case this Court would grant a mandamus to admit him, especially since it is accompanied with a temporal interest. Now admitting it should be enacted by some statute, that a mail should be incapable of such an office if he was not a knight, should not a knight degraded have a mandamus? Certainly he should ; and so had Dr. Bentley in this case.

The mandamus was granted, and the university made this return:

[The report of the case, then records, what appears to be the appeal by the university].

[Then it gives the judgments of the Chief Justice and two other judges, which includes that of Fortescue J.].

Pratt, Chief Justice. This is a case of great consequence, both as to the property, the honour, and the learning, of this university, and concerns every graduate there, to law. though at present it is the case only of one learned man, and the head of a college. The question is, whether the university can suspend and degrade, and by what rules they may proceed in either or both of these cases ? And to this matter, it is allowed they may suspend or degrade for a reasonable cause; but then the cause must be specially set forth, that the Court may judge whether it is reasonable, and accordingi And upon this ground it is, that a return of a suspension for contumacy generally will not be good, for the particulars of the contumacy ought to be specified. 5 Rep. 57. [162] It is agreeable to law, that a man shall not be deprived of his property without being heard, unless it be by his own default ; but it is hard that it should be in the power of one man to suspend or degrade another without any appeal for if he should err, as all men are subject to error, then the person suspelded or degraded has no remedy. It is allowed, that this university has a jurisdiction in several cases ; and this Court will support them in the exercise of such jurisdiction, if they do not exceed their proper bounds and limits. Now as to the return, there are several causes set forth both for the suspension and degradation, viz. in saying, " that he would not obey

48 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

the summons ; that it was illegal ; that the Vice-Chancellor stltd egit; and that he was not his judge ;" aiid all this spoken to a beadle who served the process of their court, and in a very indecent manner, in diminution of the authority thereof, and to make it ridiculous, which is consequently a contempt thereof ; and if the like had been done to an officer of this Court, it would have been accounted a great indignity, and the person should be punished ; but then the matter must be brought before the Court in a proper manner: and whether that was done in this case is now to be determined. Now by this return it appears, that depositions for a con tempt were exhibited by the beadle, but it does not shew that those depositions were taken before a proper judge ; and this being the foundation of the degradation, it does not appear to this Court that they had any power to degrade the doctor. But admitting they had such a power, then the next thing to be considered oil this return is, whether the cause returned is sufficient to justify this degradation : and if it was, then whether [163] They return, that they had power to degrade for a con it was well returned. tempt, and this was given to them by a charter of Queen Elizabeth, and for any other reasonable cause : now the cause returned was neither, for it was not a contempt to the university, but to the Vice-Chancellor's Court; it is like a contempt to a mayor, which can never be said to be a contempt to the whole corporation ; therefore, though they might degrade for a contempt to the university, it cannot be inferred from thence, that they may degrade for a contempt to a private court of that university.

Fortescue, Justice. The words are "a contempt to the court," for which he ought to have been committed if he had been present in court; and if not, he ought to have been bound to his good behaviour. I do not see how a deprivation for this cause is agreeable to reason or justice: many customs of the university have been adjudged void. It is a rule, that all customs shall be certain. Now this custom to deprive _po connacit is uncertain as to the meaning of the word "contmnacy," whether it means contumacy to the congregation, to the vice chancellor to this court, or to the university ; whether to Dr. Gooch as head of the college, or as Judge of the Iiferior Court.

Pratt, Chief Justice (as to this matter). The words are improper and indecent we should punish all persons who should speak so disrespectfully of our process, and might bind them to their good behaviour ; but the authorities seem too strong to allow a power to remove a person from his freehold for such words.

Eyre, Justice, said, that lie was not satisfied that the university can deprive for a contempt to the vice-chancellor; for a contempt to the vice-chancellor is no con tempt to the university ; they cannot deprive for all contumacies, ior have they returned a power to deprive for a contumacy to the vice-chancellor. It must be university. Suppose, in any other corporation a member should offer a contempt to an Inferior Court, can the corporation deprive- him ? No: they can only punish him as other inhabitants. A proper punishment for a contempt is fine and imprisonment, but not loss of freehold ; an officer of this Court ought not to lose his office for con temptuous words to the Court. A tenant to the lord of a manor or district cannot lose his estate for non-attendance at any court.

Fortescue, Justice. Though a degree in the university is only a civil honour, yet interest and property being the consequence of such degree, the Court considers it as such with all its attendances. It is like the case of an alderman, which of itself is no profit, only by consequence. All degrees were originally given by the Crown ; and though the present right of conferring them

49 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

is prescribed for by the university, yet that prescription must be presumed to be founded upon a right derived by authority from the Crown; so that a person advanced to the degree of a doctor, &c. may be esteemed to be advanced by the King. There were no degrees among the Grecians or Romans, nor among the first Christians ; they began about the twelfth or thirteenth century, and have been since attended with great privileges and profits, universitatis is the proper Latin word for corporation. A learned man of this university told me, that there were no degrees ever granted there until the university was a corporation. The seminaries for education of youth were antiently held in the cathedrals of the churches of the first Christians. Besides, where any person is degraded for a contumacy, it ought to be by that court to whom the contempt was offered; but it is not pretended by this return, that the vice-chancellor's court had any power to degrade. Neither does it appear that Dr. Bentley was ever summoned to answer this contempt ; and it is against natural justice to deprive a man of his right before he is heard ; therefore if there was a custom so to do, such custom would be absolutely void ; and it is a thing of daily experience to grant prohibitions to Spiritual Courts, if they deny the defendants a copy of the libel, because such denial is against natural justice. And now to offer a common instance, viz. suppose an officer of this Court should show any contempt thereof, could he be deprived of his office for such contempt? Certainly he could not. It is true, they who have argued for the university insisted, that the proceedings there are according to the civil law, and this they have done to justify the suspension, without being summoned to answer the contempt; but it does not appear upon the return (upon which this Court is (164] to judge), that they proceed there by the civil law ; and if so, then the Court must intend that they proceed by the common law, which they have not done, for there is no manner of proof that the doctor was surnmoned to appear to answer the contempt; and it can never be said, that a court which proceeds according to the common (a) law, shall suspend or degrade a person without being heard or summoned. It is said likewise, that this was not a proceeding by virtue of a charter alone, but by a charter-confirmed by Act of Parliament. Now admitting that to be true, it must be granted that convictions, even upon Acts of Parliament, are frequently quashed, for not summoning the persons convicted, though not required by the statute, because it is still against natural justice to convict without hearing, The want of a summons is an objection that can never be got over. Had the custom been returned to deprive without summons, it had been void, as against natural justice. If a justice of peace convict any man without a summons, such conviction is void. I heard a learned civilian say, that God himself would not condemn Adam for his transgression until he had called him to know what he could say in his defence. Gen. iii. 9. Such proceeding is agreeable to justice. Admitting the university has a jurisdiction, yet this Court will inquire what they have done, and how they have used that jurisdiction, as it was done in * Bushel's case, where it was insisted, that the merits of the cause could not be inquired into upon the return of a habeas corpes, but it was over-ruled ; and this Cou-t.cannot affirm the proceedings in this case without over-ruling Bushel's case, and several other authorities of the like nature.

For which reasons the Court was unanimous in granting a peremptory mandamus; and in Easter term, in the tenth year of George the First, the doctor was restored to his degree.

George the First ascended throne on 01st August 1714. His tenth year was

1724. The law report says the judgment is dated 1723.

There are examples to the principle that the decision is a nullity if a material

party is not heard in popular culture too12.

The 08th respondent in his written submissions attempts to distinguish the

following cases relied upon for the petitioner,

(i) Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd., vs Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka,

2020(1) SLR 212

The Human Rights Commission directed parties to do certain things,

whereas P.54 is only a fact finding report.

As Lord Megarry V. C. said in John vs. Rees,

These are not days of linguistic accuracy. Euphemisms13 abound: and as

I said on a completely different subject in Pet Library (London) Ltd., vs.

Walter Ellson & Son Ltd., [1968] F.S.R. 359, 361, today

12 In the English version of the play The Caucasian Chalk Circle of Bertolt Brecht, Azdak [before he was appointed the Judge by Ironshirts] in interviewing Bizergen Kazbeki, the nephew of Prince Ahzen Kazbeki, for the vacant post of a judge stages a mock trial; Azdak coming as the Grand Duke, who is accused of losing the war. Azdak maintains that he declared war only on the advise of patriots like Uncle Kazbeki, who wanted the war to steal money from the treasury. Bizergen, the candidate in his judgment finds the Grand Duke (Azdak) guilty of losing the war and sentence him to be hung by neck; and says Azdak, demanding to annul the sentence .war lost, but not for princes. Princes won their war. Collected three million eight hundred sixty three piasters for horses not delivered..Therefore victorious. War only lost by Gruzinia, not present in this court. What Azdak means is that since a necessary party is not before court, the decision is a nullity. In the German original it is said, .Krieg verloren, aber nicht fur Fursten. Fursten haben ihren Krieg gewonnen. Haben sich 3863000 Piaster fur Pferde bezahlen lassen, die nicht geliefert. Krieg nur verloren fur Grusibien, als welches nicht anwesend vor diesem Gericht. Which translates into War only lost for Grusinia, as which is not present before this court". But to the credit of Mr. Henry Jayasena who translated it into Sinhala, he adds, something that is not in the original version too, for he says, yudde peradune Grusiniawe mahajanathawa. Egollo methana neee nisa me naduwath weradyi, theenduwath weradyi!! [Caucasian chalk circle] 13 a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt when referring to something unpleasant or embarrassing.

many words of precision are being weakened by

misapplication, sometimes for convenience but more often by

ignorance: words such as alibi and disinterested spring readily

to mind. There are also words which are persistently misused; thus

even in circles of high respectability (and I look with sorrow at Vol.

29 of Halsbury's Laws of England (3rd ed.) (1960), p. 646), the word

'escapees is sometimes applied to the fugitive prisoners rather than

the governor and prison officers that they left behind them."

Nevertheless, after making all due allowances for an age of semantic laxity

I do not think the word re organize can be held to comprehend a process

which in substance amounts to expulsion without a charge and without

an opportunity to meet it. The more indefinite the language, the less

apt it is to exclude the members reasonable expectation of being

accorded natural justice.

Although the 08th respondent says fact finding, it has come to

conclusions without the affected party, the petitioner being heard; and in

a way similar to what the 08th respondent says the Human Rights

Commission did in Sri Lanka Telecom case, by way of recommendations

or otherwise it directs taking of certain action against the petitioner.

(ii) Dias vs. Abeywardene 68 NLR 409

A writ of prohibition does not lie against a Commissioner appointed

under the Commissions of Inquiry Act.

H. N. G. Fernando S. P. J., (later Chief Justice) considered the case of

King v. Electricity Commissioner [1 (1924)1 K. B. 171.].

However, his lordship said,

Let me suppose that the Commissioner in the instant case makes a

report in which is contained a determination that X intercepted certain

52 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

telephone messages at the instigation of Y and divulged the contents of

the messages to Z. There is literally nothing in the Commissions of

Inquiry Act by reason of which such a determination can create, affect or

prejudice the rights or obligations of X, or Y or Z. Even though the finding

which the Commissioner is required to reach according to his terms of

reference is that a person unlawfully intercepted a telephone message,

the finding would not be one made in terms of the Telecommunication

Ordinance, under which the function of determining whether there has

been such unlawful interception is committed solely to the ordinary

Courts. Even if the report of the Commissioner in this case were to be

published, it would not, in the absence of any supplementary legislation,

be proof for any purpose that X or Y or Z had (in the example I have

taken) done any act found by the Commissioner to have been done by

him.

The above case was decided in 1966 some 58 years ago. The distinction between

judicial and quasi judicial or administrative has thinned. In Balmoral Tanks

Limited and Balmoral Group Holdings Limited v Competition and Markets

Authority, [2019] EWCA Civ 162, Balmoral Tanks faced legal consequences for

its actions related to information sharing, even though it was not directly

involved in the initial cartel arrangements.

(iii) Fernando vs. Jayaratne 78 NLR 123

Sharvananda J., (later Chief Justice) said, that,

The only power that the Commissioner has is to inquire and make a

report and embody therein his recommendations. He has no power of

adjudication in the sense of passing an order which can be enforced

proprio vigore, nor does he make a judicial decision. The report of the

respondent has no binding force ; it is not a step in consequence of which

legally enforceable rights may be created or extinguished."

53 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

Obiter-" I am constrained to add that while there may be no duty to

act judicially, it does not follow that there is no duly to act fairly by

observing the principles of natural justice. Reason and justice

require that the person concerned against whom the Commissioner

may feel inclined to make an adverse report should be heard before

a finding is reached against him."

Hence even if the decision is not judicial audi alteram partem must be followed.

The authority 08th respondent relies itself operates to nullify his position.

(iv) Ratnagopal vs. The Attorney General 72 NLR 145

This case did not say anything about quasi judicial as the 08th

respondents learned counsel claims. The Privy Council decided, that,

.inasmuch as the scope of the inquiry was not limited by the Governor-

General and was to be decided by the Commissioner, the appointment of

the Commissioner in terms of the warrant was ultra vires and invalid

having regard to the powers of the Governor-General under section 2 of

the Commissions of Inquiry Act. It followed that the conviction of the

appellant for contempt of Court should be set aside.

The appeal was allowed.

(v) Silva and others vs. Sadique and others [1978,79,80] (1) SLR 166

Here 05 judges of the Supreme Court, among other things, said,

Before any lawfully constituted body arrives at a finding in respect

of any person, it is necessary that such body should give a fair

hearing to the person concerned. The principle audi alteram partem

is one that is widely applicable.

Hence whatever the characteristics of the commission of inquiry, etc., audi

alteram partem must be followed.

The petitioner submits, on the question, that, THE PURPORTED

CONCLUSIONS AND FINDINGS ARE JUSTICIABLE IN LAW, as follows,

In the case of Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd., vs Human Rights Commission of Sri

Lanka, SC. Appeal No. 215/12, SCM 01/03/2017, the Honourable

Supreme Court held as follows:-

If a decision of a Public Body affects the rights of an individual, can such

a decision be quashed by issuing a writ of certiorari? In this connection, I

would like to consider a passage of the judgment of Lord Justice Atkin in

Rex Vs Electricity Commissioner (1924) 1 KB 171 at 205 which reads as

follows:

Whenever anybody of persons having legal authority to determine

questions affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act

judicially, act in excess of their legal authority they are subject to the

controlling jurisdiction of the Kings Bench Division exercised in these

writs.

In B Sirisena Cooray Vs Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and Two others [1999]

1SLR 1 this court issuing a writ of certiorari quashed the determination of

the Presidential Commission. His Lordship Justice Dheeraratne in the said

judgment observed as follows:

The determinations and recommendations of the Commission are flawed

firstly as being unreasonable in that the Commissioners did not call their

own attention to the relevant matters; secondly as they are not based on

55 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

evidence of any probative value; and thirdly because those determinations

and recommendations have been reached without giving the petitioner a

right of hearing in breach of the principles of natural justice.

HWR Wade & Forsyth in the book titled Administrative Law 10th Edition

page 518 discussing the question of issue of writ of certiorari states as

follows: They will lie where there is some preliminary decision as opposed

to a mere recommendation which is a prescribed step in a statutory

process which leads to a decision affecting rights even though the

preliminary decision does not immediately affect rights itself.

In GPA DE Silva Vs Sadique [1978-79-80] page166 at page 171-172 this

court observed thus: The circumstances in which a Writ of Certiorari will

issue have been the subject of judicial pronouncements. Brett L.J. in R. v.

Local Government Board [1982] Vol: 10 QBD 309,321 said. "Wherever the

Legislature entrusts to anybody of persons other than to the superior

Courts the power of imposing an obligation upon individuals the Courts

ought to exercise as widely as they can the power of controlling those

bodies if they attempted to exceed their statutory powers." That this

principle applies not merely to statutory bodies is clear. In Wood v. Wood,

[1874] LR Vol: 9 Ex 170 it was said - 12 "this rule is not confined to the

conduct of strictly legal tribunals but is applicable to every tribunal or

body of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters

involving civil consequences to individuals." It appears to be clear that

certiorari will also lie where there is some decision, as opposed to a

recommendation, which is a prescribed step in a statutory process and

leads to an ultimate decision affecting rights even though that decision

itself does not immediately affect rights.

Considering the above legal literature, I hold that if a recommendation of

a Public Body affects the right of an individual, Superior Courts, in the

56 | C . A . W r i t 1 1 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 9 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

exercise of their writ jurisdiction, have the power to quash such a

recommendation by issuing a writ of certiorari.

Hence there is no doubt whatsoever, that, the petitioner is entitled to what he

asks.

Reliefs under paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of the petition are granted without the

part which prays for the calling of the report, as the case is over. Writs of

certiorari are granted as per paragraphs (c) and (d) and a writ of prohibition is

granted under paragraph (e).

The petitioner is entitled for the costs of this application.
