More recently, in considered judgments, the Court of Appeal in England has held that neither the common law nor the rules of natural justice require reasons to be given for decisions of that kind: R v Gaming Board; Ex parte Benaim [1970] 2 QB 417 at 430-31; Payne v Lord Harris [1981] 1 WLR 754 at 764 ; 2 All ER 842 at 850-51. It has similarly been held that domestic tribunals are not bound to give reasons for their decisions; see McInnes v Onslow-Fane [1978] 1 WLR 1520 ; 3 All ER 211 and earlier authorities collected in Pure Spring Co Ltd v Minister of National Revenue [1947] 1 DLR 501 at 534-5 The contrary view appears to have been expressed by Lord Denning MR in Breen v Amalgamated Engineering Union [1971] 2 QB 175, but that was a dissenting judgment and if it was intended to suggest that reasons must be given for the decision of a statutory or domestic body whenever the circumstances make it fair to do so it is inconsistent with R v Gaming Board; Ex parte Benaim, in which the judgment of the court was written by Lord Denning MR himself, and with Payne v Lord Harris, a decision to which Lord Denning MR was a party. https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/print?DocID=JUD%2F9ALNN85%2F00001 5 In Public Service Board of NSW v Osmond (1986) 159 CLR 656, the High Court held that there is no general duty to provide reasons for administrative decisions. The rule in Osmond has been criticised by scholars and greatly qualified by the introduction of statutory duties to give reasons. This Before the High Court examines the rule established in Osmond, the case for and against a general common law duty to provide reasons, and the various statutory duties to provide reasons. It also considers the recent law of several other common law jurisdictions, by which the courts have recognised limited duties to provide reasons for administrative decisions. The pending case of Wingfoot Australia Partners Pty Ltd v Kocak [2013] HCA Trans 105 (Kocak), for which special leave was granted on 10 May 2013, provides an occasion for limited but important change to the law.

In the story, the jury plays a crucial role in the trial of Tom Robinson, a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell.

It is like the case of a recorder of a corporation who was removeable at will, and being displaced moved for a mandamus, but it was denied. Besides, the constant course and custom of this university warrants a dis cretionary power amongst them to confer degrees on some, and to degrade others for any contempt; and in this case they have done all they could to bring Dr. Bentley to an easy agreement; for after the first summons they sent another in writing by their beadle, but the doctor's doors were then shut, and he would not be seen ; then they adjourned from day to day, on purpose to give him leave to appear, before they would suspend him ; but when he contemptuously declined, they first suspended and afterwards degraded him. Now as a mandamus was never yet granted to admit a man to a degree in the university, after he had performed all his exercises, so there ought to be none to restore one after a degradation, because degrees are arbitrarily given by the universities, and so are degradations arbitrarily made; for if they should by any means rashly admit an unlearned man to a degree, they may upon better information degrade him, without taking a traverse to the return of a mandamus, which must be tried by a jury of lay freeholders. Besides, these degrees are but titles of honour and precedency, and give no temporal right, and for that reason a mandamus ought not to go ; for if a knight should be degraded in a Court of Honour, no mandamus would lie to restore him (a), which is a case in point ; therefore if it should lie in this case, it would introduce a new method to evade [150] the privileges given by this charter, which was afterwards confirmed by Parliament; and as it hath been formerly adjudged in the case of Castle v. Litchfield (b), that a certiorari or writ of error will not lie to correct a judgment given for a contempt, so no mandamus ought to go, which is in effect the same. If it should be objected, that his degree qualifies him for some temporal employment, of which he would be incapable without it; now admitting that to be true, yet such employments are only consequential, and not directly incident to his degree, and therefore ought not to be regarded. And is another objection should be made, viz. that the doctor would have appeared by a proctor, but was not allowed so to do; though this may be true, yet it is no objection of weight, because it might not be the course of their court to admit such appearances, and the universities have a privilege to proceed according to their own laws, as an encouragement to learning; and if they have proceeded accordingly, this Court will not interpose. Now take the case as it stands upon Dr. Bentley's affidavit, there will be no reason to grant a mandamus; for he makes oath, that he has appealed from the sentence of the University Court; which if true, then there is another remedy for him to be restored, viz. by an appeal ; and where there is another remedy, a mandamus is never granted. Moreover the doctor made oath, that the university had no power to degrade him ; if so, then he is not degraded for want of a sufficient power so to do, and consequently a mandamus ought not to go, for it is impossible that a man should be restored to his degree who was never degraded.",

It is true, this might have been a proper objection before the statutes of 21 Hen. 8, c. 13, and 13 & 14 Car. 2, c. 4, were made, which render a man incapable of a benefice if he had not taken his degrees in some university ; for before those statutes, such degrees were only titles of precedency, and the allowing them, or a degradation, was no temporal advantage or loss ; therefore in such case the Temporal Courts had no reason to interpose ; and this may be the reason why the universities degraded ad libitim, and of their constant course so to do. But this is no objection since the making those statutes. Neither shall it be said, that where a corporation has admitted a mal willingly to his freedom, that they shall have power to disfranchise him, because they do not like him ; neither can the universities give degrees to whom they please, and take them away ad libitum. AinI though their counsel have objected against this mandamus, for that they have an exempt and absolute jurisdiction amongst them selves, this seems to be a good reason why it should be granted, though it might have been otherwise if they had shewed that they had a visitor, to whom an appeal would lie ; for probably that might have excluded the superintendency of this Court; but to deny a degree to him who had performed all his exercises to qualify him for a degree, would be a great discouragement to learning; and in such case this Court would grant a mandamus to admit him, especially since it is accompanied with a temporal interest. Now admitting it should be enacted by some statute, that a mail should be incapable of such an office if he was not a knight, should not a knight degraded have a mandamus? Certainly he should ; and so had Dr. Bentley in this case.",

This is a case of great consequence, both as to the property, the honour, and the learning, of this university, and concerns every graduate there, to law. though at present it is the case only of one learned man, and the head of a college. The question is, whether the university can suspend and degrade, and by what rules they may proceed in either or both of these cases ? And to this matter, it is allowed they may suspend or degrade for a reasonable cause; but then the cause must be specially set forth, that the Court may judge whether it is reasonable, and accordingi And upon this ground it is, that a return of a suspension for contumacy generally will not be good, for the particulars of the contumacy ought to be specified. 5 Rep. 57. [162] It is agreeable to law, that a man shall not be deprived of his property without being heard, unless it be by his own default ; but it is hard that it should be in the power of one man to suspend or degrade another without any appeal for if he should err, as all men are subject to error, then the person suspelded or degraded has no remedy. It is allowed, that this university has a jurisdiction in several cases ; and this Court will support them in the exercise of such jurisdiction, if they do not exceed their proper bounds and limits. Now as to the return, there are several causes set forth both for the suspension and degradation, viz. in saying, \" that he would not obey",

    "text": "is prescribed for by the university, yet that prescription must be presumed to be founded upon a right derived by authority from the Crown; so that a person advanced to the degree of a doctor, &c. may be esteemed to be advanced by the King. There were no degrees among the Grecians or Romans, nor among the first Christians ; they began about the twelfth or thirteenth century, and have been since attended with great privileges and profits, universitatis is the proper Latin word for corporation. A learned man of this university told me, that there were no degrees ever granted there until the university was a corporation. The seminaries for education of youth were antiently held in the cathedrals of the churches of the first Christians. Besides, where any person is degraded for a contumacy, it ought to be by that court to whom the contempt was offered; but it is not pretended by this return, that the vice-chancellor's court had any power to degrade. Neither does it appear that Dr. Bentley was ever summoned to answer this contempt ; and it is against natural justice to deprive a man of his right before he is heard ; therefore if there was a custom so to do, such custom would be absolutely void ; and it is a thing of daily experience to grant prohibitions to Spiritual Courts, if they deny the defendants a copy of the libel, because such denial is against natural justice. And now to offer a common instance, viz. suppose an officer of this Court should show any contempt thereof, could he be deprived of his office for such contempt? Certainly he could not. It is true, they who have argued for the university insisted, that the proceedings there are according to the civil law, and this they have done to justify the suspension, without being summoned to answer the contempt; but it does not appear upon the return (upon which this Court is (164] to judge), that they proceed there by the civil law ; and if so, then the Court must intend that they proceed by the common law, which they have not done, for there is no manner of proof that the doctor was surnmoned to appear to answer the contempt; and it can never be said, that a court which proceeds according to the common (a) law, shall suspend or degrade a person without being heard or summoned. It is said likewise, that this was not a proceeding by virtue of a charter alone, but by a charter-confirmed by Act of Parliament. Now admitting that to be true, it must be granted that convictions, even upon Acts of Parliament, are frequently quashed, for not summoning the persons convicted, though not required by the statute, because it is still against natural justice to convict without hearing, The want of a summons is an objection that can never be got over. Had the custom been returned to deprive without summons, it had been void, as against natural justice. If a justice of peace convict any man without a summons, such conviction is void. I heard a learned civilian say, that God himself would not condemn Adam for his transgression until he had called him to know what he could say in his defence. Gen. iii. 9. Such proceeding is agreeable to justice. Admitting the university has a jurisdiction, yet this Court will inquire what they have done, and how they have used that jurisdiction, as it was done in * Bushel's case, where it was insisted, that the merits of the cause could not be inquired into upon the return of a habeas corpes, but it was over-ruled ; and this Cou-t.cannot affirm the proceedings in this case without over-ruling Bushel's case, and several other authorities of the like nature.",

Azdak maintains that he declared war only on the advise of patriots like Uncle Kazbeki, who wanted the war to steal money from the treasury. Bizergen, the candidate in his judgment finds the Grand Duke (Azdak) guilty of losing the war and sentence him to be hung by neck; and says Azdak, demanding to annul the sentence .war lost, but not for princes. Princes won their war. Collected three million eight hundred sixty three piasters for horses not delivered..Therefore victorious. War only lost by Gruzinia, not present in this court. What Azdak means is that since a necessary party is not before court, the decision is a nullity. In the German original it is said, .Krieg verloren, aber nicht fur Fursten. Fursten haben ihren Krieg gewonnen. Haben sich 3863000 Piaster fur Pferde bezahlen lassen, die nicht geliefert. Krieg nur verloren fur Grusibien, als welches nicht anwesend vor diesem Gericht.
