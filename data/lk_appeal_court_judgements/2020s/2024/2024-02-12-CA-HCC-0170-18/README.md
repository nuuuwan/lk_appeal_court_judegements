Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Colombo on following counts.

(1) The Appellant possessed a T-56 gun without a lawful authority on

22nd May 2005, and thereby committed an offence punishable in

Page 3 of 14

terms of section 22(3) read with section 22(1) of Act No-37 of 1916 as

amended by Amendment Act No- 22 of 1996.

(2) At the same time and at the same transaction, he possessed 29 live

ammunitions, and thereby committed an offence punishable in terms

of section 27 read with section 9 of the Explosives Act No- 21 of 1956.

Although the prosecution has not mentioned the relevant Act by its name in

the first count, it has not been disputed that it was in fact, the Firearms

Ordinance under which the appellant has been indicted in relation to the first

count.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo found the appellant guilty

as charged of his judgment dated 24-08-2018. Accordingly, he had been

sentenced to life imprisonment on count one, and for a period of six months

imprisonment on the second count.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant

preferred this appeal.

Before I move on to consider the grounds of appeal raised by the learned

Presidents Counsel, I find it useful to mention the facts in brief that led to the

arrest of the appellant.

Facts in brief

PW-01 who was the officer-in-charge of the Organized Crimes Division of

Criminal Investigations Department has been informed on 22-05-2005 at

around 1.30 - 2.00 p.m. by a subordinated officer that an information had been

received about an illegal possession of a T-56 gun in the Peliyagoda police area.

This has resulted in him joining with the police team who were already in that

area and leading the raid conducted in that regard.

Page 4 of 14

Acting on the information provided by the private informant, PW-01 and his

team of officers had surrounded the house mentioned and had confronted the

appellant who was in the upper floor of the house.

When they searched the room occupied by the appellant, it is alleged that they

discovered the T-56 gun and the ammunition under the mattress of the bed

used by the appellant. Accordingly, the appellant has been arrested for the

offences of illegal possession of a gun and ammunition, and the indictment

preferred against him was the result of that arrest.

At the trial, although two Sub Inspectors of Police and several other police

officers had accompanied the PW-01 in the raid, the prosecution has called

PW-09, PS23481 who was one of the officers who took part in the raid to

substantiate the evidence of PW-01 in relation the discovery of the T-56 gun

and ammunition.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel formulated the

following ground of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

(1) The case has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt as required in

an action of this nature.

(2) The conviction cannot be supported having regard to the evidence led

at the trial.

(3) There is no evaluation of the prosecution evidence.

(4) The learned High Court Judge has failed to appreciate the credibility

of PW-01 and PW-09 who gave evidence before the Court, especially in

the context that the raid was a planned detection.

Page 5 of 14

(5) The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself of the burden of

the prosecution and that of the defence, and the Ellenborough dictum

was applied erroneously.

(6) There was no proper analysis of the dock statement.

(7) The judgment was totally contrary to section 283 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

(8) The absence of notes by the police officers in the context of fact that

this was a planned detection has not been considered by the learned

High Court Judge.

(9) Whether it is safe to convict the accused under the circumstances.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

The learned Presidents Counsel made extensive submissions in relation to the

evidence led before the trial Court to argue that the prosecution has failed to

prove the charges against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. However, the

learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) on behalf of the respondent contended

that there was sufficient evidence before the trial Court to prove the guilt of the

appellant.

Although submissions were made in relation to the facts, since it was mainly

contended that the judgment pronounced by the learned High Court Judge has

denied a fair trial towards the appellant because of the way the learned High

Court Judge had apparently decided to convict the appellant, I find it necessary

to consider the relevant grounds of appeal urged before moving onto other

grounds of appeal. Hence, I will now consider the relevant 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th,

grounds of appeal collectively.

It was contended that the learned High Court Judge has decided the matter

based on the defence taken up by the appellant and not deciding whether the

Page 6 of 14

prosecution has proved the charges beyond reasonable doubt. It was pointed

out that the judgment cannot be considered as a Judgement in terms of section

283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and, therefore, should be set aside.

In this regard, the submission of the learned DSG has been that each trial

Judge has his or her own way of writing judgements, and merely because the

learned High Court Judge has not followed the conventional approach of

writing a judgement, it cannot have the effect of vitiating the same. He was of

the view that since the prosecution has established a strong prima facie case

against the appellant at the trial, this is a fit case where ordering a retrial

should be considered in the event the Court agrees with the submissions of the

learned Presidents Counsel on the validity of the judgment.

The essential ingredients of a judgement in terms of section 283(1), (2) and (3)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act read as follows;

283. The following provisions shall apply for the judgments of

courts other than the Supreme Court or Court of Appeal:-

(1) The judgment shall be written by the Judge who heard the

case and shall be dated and signed by him in open court at the

time of pronouncing it, and in a case where appeal lies shall

contain the point or points for determination, the decision

thereon, and the reasons for the decision.

(2) It shall specify the offence if any of which and the section

of the law under which the accused is convicted and the

punishment to which he is sentenced.

(3) If it be a judgment of acquittal it shall state the offence of

which the accused is acquitted.

Page 7 of 14

In this regard, Jayasuriya, J. with reference to several other decided cases

observed the following, in the case of Chandrasena and Others Vs.

Munaweera (1998) 3 SLR 94 at 96,

In Ibrahim Vs. Inspector of Police 59 NLR 235, the Supreme Court

emphasized that the mere outline of the prosecution and the defence

without reasons being given for the decision but embellished by such

phrases as I accept the evidence of the prosecution and I disbelieve the

defence is by itself an insufficient discharge of duty cast upon the Judge

by section 306 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Vide also the decision in

Thusaiya Vs. Pathihamy 15 CLW 119 by Nihill, J.- According to the

presently applicable section 283(1) of the Code 283(1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, the judgement shall contain the

point or points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for

the decision. In the Supreme Court stressed that the object of the statutory

provision is to enable the Supreme Court to have before it the specific

opinion of the Judge in the lower Court on the question of fact, so that it

may enable the Court to ascertain whether the finding is correct or not. The

weight of authority is to the effect that the failure to observe the imperative

provisions of the section is a fatal irregularity and that even in a simple

case that the provisions of this statute must be complied with.

Considering grounds of appeal similar in nature, Ranjith Silva, J. in C.A.

Appeal No. 62-65/2005 decided on 07-06-2011 made the following

observation emphasizing the importance of a proper judgment.

We have perused the judgement and the judgement runs into nine pages

but not a single paragraph contains any evaluation of evidence. The

learned Judge has not said anything about omissions and had just

brushed aside one of the contradictions stating that they are insignificant

Page 8 of 14

but does not refer to the other two contradictions. This judgement is only a

repetition of evidence and does not amount to a judgement in terms of

section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The learned Judge

appears to have very conveniently discharged her functions without taking

any pains to write a proper judgement. It is extremely pathetic to note how

much time and how much money that has been spent on this case over the

years and finally it has to end up in a situation where this Court is

compelled to order a retrial. It is also true that the learned High Court

Judge has turned a blind eye with regard to the dock statement. She has

not mentioned the concepts or a single authority or tried to appreciate or

evaluate the dock statement in that light. In this context although we find

that the Judge could have find that easily supported the conviction with

real evaluation of evidence and contradictions and omissions, we are

unable to justify this although a Court of Appeal will not lightly interfere

with the findings of facts especially with regard to the credibility.

Although I am in agreement with the learned DSG that each Judge has his or

her own way of judgement writing, and no specific format can be expected in a

judgement, I am also of the view that whatever the way of writing may be, the

basic ingredients of a judgement cannot be disregarded in the guise of ones

own way of writing.

As pointed out correctly by the learned Presidents Counsel, the learned High

Court Judge has commenced the judgement by considering the defence put

forward by the appellant. After commenting on the defence case, the learned

High Court Judge has stated that, firstly, it is necessary to consider whether

the prosecution has proved the case beyond doubt and any attempt by the

accused to create a doubt should not be a mere doubt but a reasonable doubt.

Page 9 of 14

Having determined as above, I find that the learned High Court Judge, rather

than analyzing the prosecution evidence and coming to a finding that the

evidence can be believed and the prosecution has established a strong prima

facie case, has compared the stand taken up by the accused with the

prosecution evidence to determine that the defence case cannot be accepted.

Throughout the judgement, it is clear that the learned High Court Judge has

relied on the weaknesses of the defence put forward by the appellant at the

trial in order to find him guilty.

In the Indian case of Narender Kumar Vs. State (NCT of Delhi) AIR 2012 SC

2281, it was stated that;

Prosecution case has to stand on its own legs and cannot take support

from the weaknesses of the case of defence. However, grate the suspicion

against the accused and however strong the moral belief and conviction of

the court, unless the offence of the accused is established beyond

reasonable doubt on the basis of legal evidence and material before the

court, he cannot be convicted for an offence.

In the case of R. Venkatakrishnan Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation

(2009) INSC 1409 (7th August 2009), it was held:

The law is certain that the prosecution must stand on its own legs basing

its findings on the evidence that has been led by it. It matters little as to

whether the accused has made out a plausible defence or not.

It is well settled law that the duty of a trial Judge is to consider the evidence

placed before the Court, whether by the prosecution or by the defence as a

whole, and come to his findings, rather than compartmentalizing as happened

in the impugned judgement.

Page 10 of 14

Although the learned High Court Judge has claimed that the evidence was

considered as a whole towards the very end of the judgement, I find no basis to

accept that this was a judgement reached after considering the evidence placed

before it in its correct perspective.

In the case of James Silva Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 SLR 167,

the trial Judge stated, I had considered the defence of the accused and I hold

that it is untenable and false in the light of the evidence led by the

prosecution.

Held:

There is a serious misdirection in law. It is a grave error for trial Judge to

direct himself that he must examine the tenability and truthfulness of

the evidence of the accused in the light of the evidence led by the

prosecution. To examine the evidence of the defence of the accused in the

light of the prosecution witness is to reverse the presumption of

innocence.

Per Rodrigo, J.

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to

consider all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the

prosecution or by the defence in its totality without

compartmentalizing and, ask himself whether as a prudent man, in

the circumstances of the particular case, he believes the accused

guilty or not guilty.- See the Privy Council judgement in Jayasena

Vs. The Queen 72 NLR 313.

For the reasons as considered above, I find that this a judgment that shall not

be allowed to stand on the considered grounds of appeal alone, since it cannot

Page 11 of 14

be considered a judgement pronounced in accordance with the law. Hence, I

find it unnecessary to consider the other grounds of appeal urged on behalf of

the appellant.

Accordingly, I have no option but to set aside the conviction and the sentence

dated 24-08-2018 by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

Having determined as such, for completeness of this judgement, I find it

appropriate to reproduce the Indian Supreme Court judgement in the case of

State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Anthony (1984) SCJ 236/ (1985) CRI L.J. 493

at 498/499, cited by the learned DSG in his written submissions, which I

believe would provide clear guidance as to how to approach the analyzing of

evidence in a case by a trial Judge.

It was held:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be

whether the evidence of the witness read as whole appears to have ring of

truth. Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the

Court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the

deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a

whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor

of evidence given by the witness and whether earlier evaluation of the

evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies

on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical

approach by taking sentences torn out of context here and there from the

evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the

investigating officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily

permit the rejection of the evidence as a whole. If the Court before whom

the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about

the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the appellate Court

Page 12 of 14

which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the

appreciation of evidence by the trial Court and unless there are reasons

weightily and formidable it would not be proper to reject the evidence on

the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matter of trivial details.

Even honest and truthful witness may differ in some details unrelated to

the main incident because power of observation, retention and

reproduction differ with individuals.

The next matter to be considered is whether this is a fit case to send back for a

retrial as contended by the learned DSG.

This is an incident that is said have occurred on 22 May 2005, more that 18

years ago. The indictment is dated 8th May 2006. The trial proper has

commenced on 24-10-2007. The judgement has been pronounced on 24-08-

2018. More that 13 years after the alleged incident. The appellant had been in

incarceration since his conviction, which amounts to almost five and a half

years from the date of the judgement.

In the case of Nandasena Vs. Attorney General (2008) 1 SLR 51, it was held:

A discretion is vested in thew Court whether or not to order a retrial in a

fit case, which discretion should be exercised judicially to satisfy the ends

of justice taking into consideration the nature of the evidence available, the

time duration since the date of the appeal, the period of incarceration the

accused had already suffered, the trauma and hazards an accused person

would have to suffer in being subjected to a second trial for no fault on his

part and the resultant traumatic effect in his immediate family members

who have no connection to the alleged crime, should be considered.

Page 13 of 14

In the case of L.C. Fernando Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 79-II NLR 313 at

374 it was held:

It is a basic principle of the criminal law of our land, that a retrial is to be

ordered only, if it appears to the Court that the interests of justice so

require.

The charge laid against the accused is of serious nature, and it may be, a

trial Court may find the accused guilty at a retrial upon relevant and

admissible evidence. But it must be remembered that the acquisitions have

been made about seven years ago.

Further, the trial had been long and protracted. There have been no less

than thirty-five trial dates. The accused would have to bear undue

hardship and heavy expense to defend himself again. I must also state

that the defence in no way contributed to the reception of inadmissible and

irrelevant evidence, which prejudice the trial.

Under the circumstances, it seems to me to be harsh and unjust to order a

retrial. It does not appear to me that the interests of justice require a

retrial.

Apart from the above considerations, I find it necessary to consider that that

this was a raid conducted by a group of police officers where the appellant is

said to have been found possessing a weapon. If a retrial is ordered, the

witnesses being police officers who have the advantage of referring to their

notes will be in a position to rectify whatever the shortcomings in their

evidence, which amounts to a denial of a fair trial towards the appellant.

Page 14 of 14

Therefore, having considered the above factual matters and the law, I am of the

view that this is not a case fit to order a retrial.

The appellant is acquitted of the charges preferred against him.

Appeal allowed.
