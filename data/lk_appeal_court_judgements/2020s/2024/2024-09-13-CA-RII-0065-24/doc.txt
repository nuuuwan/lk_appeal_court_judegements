This is an application for restitutio-in-integrum under section 753 of the Civil Procedure

Code read with the Article 138 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of

Sri Lanka.

In this instant case, the Substituted Plaintiff Appellant Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Petitioner) Ms. Hetti Pathirennehelage Ganga Kumari is challenging both

the judgements of the Civil Appellate High Court of Anuradhapura dated 29th of November

2023 in case bearing No. NCP/HCCA/ANP/FA/033/22 and the District Court of

Polonnaruwa dated 10th of March 2022 in Case bearing No. 13858/L.

The Petitioners father initiated legal proceedings under case number 13858/L in the District

Court of Polonnaruwa, seeking a judgment that the 1st Respondent holds no rightful claim to

the disputed land under Deed No. 1010, and further requesting a declaration that the land

described in the second schedule rightfully belongs to the Petitioner. The Petitioner asserts

that the 2nd Respondent is the spouse of the 1st Respondent, both of whom have refuted the

Petitioners claims. However, both the District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court

have rejected the Petitioners applications.

Being aggrieved by the said decisions, Petitioner seeks permission to consider this restitutio-

in-integrum application on the following grounds.

a) There are serious of miscarriage of justice in the judgement of their Lordships of the

Civil Appellate High Court and the Learned District Judge, therefore Your Lordships

have right to exercise the Restitutio-in-integrum powers and set aside the judgment of

the Civil Appellate High Court and the District Court.

b) The judgement of the District Court is contrary to the Law and against the

fundamental principles of Law.

c) Their Lordships of the Civil Appellate High Court as well as the Learned District

Judge have determined the Deed No. 1010 was duly executed instrument by a Notary

Public in terms of Notaries Ordinance and the Prevention of Fraud Ordinance is

wrong.

d) The Lordships of the Civil Appeal High Court as well as the Learned District Judge

have not considered the Defendants marking document 9.

e) The Lordships of the Civil Appeal High Court as well as the Learned District Judge

have not considered the fact that whether the Deed No. 1010 was duly executed and

whether there was a consideration for execute the deed between the parties.

The extraordinary jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum is meant to be used only in very rare

and exceptional circumstances where no other legal remedies are available, and the court is

faced with a situation so unjust that it demands intervention. This remedy is not one that

courts will invoke lightly; instead, it is reserved for cases where specific and stringent criteria

are met.

The invocation of the extraordinary jurisdiction of restitutio in integrum is tightly restricted

to situations where an order is blatantly wrong on its face, leaves the Petitioner with no other

remedy, it is ex-facie contrary to accepted legal principles and is so unjust that it shocks the

conscience of the court. It is a remedy of last resort, reserved for only the most egregious

cases, where an obvious and undeniable miscarriage of justice has taken place.

In the case SRI LANKA INSURANCE CORPORATION LTD. v. SHANMUGAM AND

ANOTHER (1995) 1 SLR 55 Ranaraja J. held that,

In this country the remedy of restitutio in integrum was recognised as a mode of

relief as far back as the time of Sir Charles Marshall, and has taken deep root in the practice

and procedure of our courts. (Abeysekera Vs. Haramanis Appu 14 NLR 353). At present,

Article 138(1) of the Constitution has vested this court with sole and exclusive jurisdiction to

grant relief by way of restitutio in integrum. This remedy cannot, unlike an appeal, be

claimed by a party as of right. The power of this court to grant such relief is a matter of

grace and discretion. (Usoof v. Nandarajah Chettiar 61 NLR 173). The power of restitution

differs from revisionary power of this court in that the latter is exercised where the legality or

propriety of any order or proceedings of a lower court is questioned. Restitution reinstates a

party to his original legal condition which he has been deprived of by the operation of law.

Thus it follows, the remedy can be availed of only by one who is actually a party to the legal

proceeding in respect of which restitution is desired. (Perera v. Wijewickrema 15 NLR 411),

(Menchinahamy v. Munaweera 52 NLR 409). A party seeking restitution must also show that

he has suffered actual damage, (Phipps v. Bracegyrdle 35 NLR 302) although damages

cannot be claimed in an application for restitution. (Dember v. Abdul Hafeel 49 NLR 62).

Restitutio in integrum being an extraordinary remedy, it is not to be given for the mere asking

Page 5 of 7

or where there is some other remedy available (Mapalathan v. Elayavan 41 NLR 115). It is a

remedy which is granted under exceptional circumstances and the power of court should be

most cautiously and sparingly exercised, (Perera v. Wijewickrama 15 NLR 411). A party

seeking restitution must act with utmost promptitude, Babun Appu v. Simon Appu 11 NLR

115, (Menchinahamy v. Munaweera 52 NLR 411), and before a change has taken place in the

position of the parties, (Sinnethamby v. Nallathamby 7 NLR 139). Where there has been

negligence on the part of the applicant seeking relief or his attorney-at-law, restitution will

not be granted, (Wickremasooriya v. Abeywardene 15 NLR 472). The party invoking the

extraordinary powers of this court must display honesty and frankness. Thus where a party

by its own conduct has acquiesced in or approbated the defective proceedings, court will not

exercise its discretion to set aside the impugned proceedings. For it is not the function of

court in the exercise of its jurisdiction in restitution to relieve the parties of the consequences

of their own folly, negligence or laches, (Don Lewis v. Dissanayake 70 NLR 8)

Therefore, in the absence of these stringent conditions, we must refrain from utilizing this

extraordinary measure, adhering instead to the ordinary legal processes and remedies

available within the framework of civil litigation. None of the grounds mentioned above do

not fall within the scope of restitutio in integrum. All these grievances could have been

remedied by an appeal to the Supreme Court.

In the matter at hand, learned district judge of Polonnaruwa has dismissed the application on

10th of March 2022 and being aggrieved by the said decision the Petitioner has appealed to

the Civil Appeal High Court of Anuradhapura and the learned judges of the said court also

have dismissed the application.

However, according to the section 5C of the High Courts of Provinces (Special Provisions)

(Amendment) Act No.54 of 2006, the Petitioner can appeal directly to the Supreme Court

against any judgement, decree or order pronounced or entered by a High Court established by

Article 154P of the Constitution in the exercise of its jurisdiction granted by section 5A of

this Act with leave of the Supreme Court first had and obtained. According to the Article 5A

of the Act, a High Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from District Courts and Family

Courts.

It is pertinent to note that all the grounds urged by the Petitioner could have been adequately

addressed by an appeal to the Supreme Court, in accordance with Section 5C of the High

Courts of Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006. However, the

Petitioner did not avail himself of this option, and this omission is attributable to his

negligence. It is a well-established principle that when a party is afforded a clear legal avenue

for redress, such as the right to appeal to the Supreme Court, the onus lies on that party to

exercise the option within the prescribed period. In the present case, the party was fully aware

of their right to appeal but chose not to act in a timely manner.

The party now seeks relief by way of restitutio in integrum. However, the Court cannot

overlook the fact that this failure to appeal is not attributable to any external impediment but

stems from their own inaction. Restitutio in integrum is not designed to rescue a party from

the consequences of their own neglect or carelessness.

Their failure to exercise the option to appeal to the Supreme Court, when available and

clearly within their rights, is a significant omission. It is neither a mere oversight nor a trivial

lapse; it reflects a disregard for procedural diligence. The law favors those who act within the

framework of due process, and the party's failure in this regard cannot be remedied by

invoking restitutio in integrum.

In the case A.K.W. Perera Vs. G.Don Simon 62 NLR 118 Sansoni J. stated that,

Restitutio in integrum can be claimed on the ground of Justus error, which I

understand to connote reasonable or excusable error. I am unable to see that such a ground

exists in this case. It is, on the contrary, an example of damage arising from carelessness or

negligence. I would refer in this connection to Mapalathan v. Elayavan 41 NLR 115 and

Dember v. Abdul Hafeel 49 NLR 62. In those cases, it was held that restitutio would not be

granted where there has been negligence on the part of the applicant for relief. The case is

all the worse if the error is due to the act of the plaintiff himself, as would appear to be the

case here.

As such, the Court finds that the request for restitution is untenable. The partys failure to

appeal, being a product of their own neglect, precludes them from the relief they now seek.

In light of the above, as this case does not fall within the scope of restitutio in integrum, I

refuse to issue notice on the Respondents.
