i) to grant such other and further reliefs.

Facts of the Petitioners case

3) The Petitioner has contended that the Petitioner is a citizen of Sri

Lanka. The Petitioner is a tax payer of the 1st Respondents

Department. Further the Petitioner had stated for the assessment

years 2008/2009 to 2013/2014 the Petitioner had duly paid her

income tax payments.

4) Subsequently, additional assessment notices had been issued to the

Petitioner dated 18th April 2016 in respect of an alleged additional

income received by rent and salary.

5) The Petitioner is a resident of Baudhaloka Mawatha Colombo 7

since the year 2000. The aforesaid assessment notices were served

at Katuwela Road, Madewachchiya. The Petitioner had not received

the said notices and had not responded to it.

6) Later a notice of default had been dispatched to the Petitioner to her

residence at Katuwela Road, Madewachchiya on 3rd November 2016.

7) The Petitioner did not receive the said default notice. Subsequently

the 1st Respondent had sent further reminders to the Petitioner.

8) On that the Petitioner had received communications of the pending

matters at the Department of Inland Revenue and the Petitioner had

sent two detailed replies to the Department of Inland Revenue which

is marked and produced as P6 (a) and P6 (b) for which the Petitioner

had not received a reply.

9) Later, on the request made by the Petitioner, an interview was

granted by the Respondents to which the Petitioner attended and

objected for the additional assessment made by the 1st Respondent

and to revise it.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

10) As a result of the aforesaid request, additional notice of assessment

dated 26th July 2017 was issued and the Petitioner duly made the

payments accordingly and no appeal had been lodged against the

said notice.

11) On 4th June 2019 the Petitioner was served with a notice to submit

further documents for the assessment years 2015/2016 to

2017/2018 and was requested to be present for an interview on 24th

September 2019.

12) The Petitioner has contended, that the Petitioner had already settled

the assessment values for the year 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.

Therefore, the Petitioner had not made any appeal for the

assessment notice dated 26th July 2017.

13) The reminder letters regarding the assessment payments dated 3rd

July 2019 and 19th July 2019 had been dispatched to the

Madewachchiya address. Subsequently, the Petitioner had replied to

those letters and had requested additional time to submit a detailed

explanation.

14) Later the Petitioner was called for an interview on 24th September

2019. The said interview had finally taken place on 18th October

2019. The grounds on which the interview was held was incorrect

and after making the payment for the assessment years 2011/2012

a fresh assessment had been issued.

15) Further the 4th Respondent had taken steps to issue tax in default

notice for the year 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 imposing Rs.

12,945,648/- for the year 2011/2012 and Rs. 5,038,797/- for the

year 2012/2013.

16) The Petitioner vehemently objected to the said notice of default

marked and produced as P19 which is illegal, unlawful and

irrational.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

6

17) Subsequently, once again the Petitioner was served with a further

notice of default on 1st January 2020 where the 3rd Respondent had

deducted the payments made by P11(a) and P11(b) and had issued a

further tax default notice by P24.

18) The Petitioner has contended the said tax default notice is

completely repugnant to the relevant provisions of the Inland

Revenue Act No.10 of 2006 which was objected to by the Petitioner

by letter marked and produced as P25.

19) Later the Department of Inland Revenue had sent seizure notices to

the Banks where the Petitioners accounts are maintained and

issued summons from the Magistrate Court of Anuradhapura for

non-payment of tax on a sum of Rs.179,996,393/-

20) After obtaining the case record, the Petitioner had found an

amended certificate of tax in default which is marked and produced

as P29(a) and P29(b) which is illegal, irrational and wrongful which

violated the Provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No.10 of 2006.

21) On the said grounds the Petitioner had sought to invoke the Writ

Jurisdiction of this Court for the conduct of ultra vires, illegal,

unreasonable, unfair and irrational which violates the legitimate

expectation of the Petitioner.

Objections of the 1st to 5th Respondents

22) The Respondents had stated that the Petitioner had not submitted

accurate information in her returns. Her additional income had not

been declared and revealed. On that, due payment of income tax

had been evaded by the Petitioner.

23) On the said grounds, P1 (a) to P1 (f) additional assessments had

been issued by the Respondents with regard to the undeclared rent

and salary which was not included in the declared returns.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

7

24) However, the Petitioner failed to pay the taxes referred to in the

additional assessment and or appeal against that. Thus the 6

notices of assessments were deemed to be final as per the Provisions

of the Inland Revenue Act.

25) Thereafter, the Respondents had issued 2 notices of tax in default

and reminders which are marked and produced as P2 (a), P2 (b) and

P3.

26) As the Petitioner had not honoured the tax default notices the

Respondents have informed the Petitioner by P3 document that legal

action will be instituted on the unpaid tax default notices.

27) As the aforesaid P3 notice had been flouted the Respondents had

instituted action in the Magistrate Court of Anuradhpura based on

the certificate of tax in default.

28) Even though the Petitioner had failed to appear the Magistrate had

not reissued notice and the case was laid by until the verification of

the Petitioners address.

29) Further the Respondents have contended that the Petitioners letter

dated 29th November 2016 which is marked as P6 (b) had requested

that the assessment issued to the Petitioner be canceled.

30) Letters marked as 1R5 and 1R5 (a) are letters of intimation and not

assessments and an appeal sent prior to the assessment cannot be

considered by the Respondents. The actual assessments are dated

30th November 2016 which is marked as 1R6 and 1R6 (a).

31) On the said grounds, the Respondents had contended that the

Respondents had taken steps to recover the tax due by the

Petitioner as the assessments had been finalized.

32) On that, the Petitioner does not have any legal right for discretionary

remedies of the Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus and the

Respondents had moved to dismiss the application of the Petitioner.

Disputed facts

33) The argument commenced on 27th October 2023 and the Counsel

for the Petitioner concluded his submissions. Subsequently the

matter was refixed and the learned Deputy Solicitor General made

her submissions on 6th December 2023 and the Counsel for the

Petitioner concluded his reply submissions on 13th December

2023. Thereafter both parties have filed their written submissions.

34) In considering the petition, objections, written submissions,

documents and arguments raised before this court, to address the

issues in this matter the following disputed points should be

considered.

I. Is the Petitioner a tax payer?

II. Has the Petitioner disclosed all her income for the assessment

years 2008/2009 to 2013/2014 as per P29 (a) and (b) notices?

III. If not, is the Petitioner liable to pay the income tax as per the

default notices 1R12 and 1R15?

I) Is the Petitioner a tax payer?

35) Both parties have admitted that the Petitioner is a tax payer.

36) The issue in this case had arisen after the issuance of P1 (a) to P1 (f)

additional notices of assessments on which the dispute of payment

of tax for the years 2008/2009 to 2013/2014 had evolved.

37) Therefore, it is obvious that the Petitioner is a tax payer to the

Respondent Inland Revenue Department.

38) It is noteworthy to consider the literary construction of the definition

of tax. Blacks Law Dictionary1 gives the definition for tax as follows;

1 Black's Law Dictionary, 11th ed., Bryan A. Garner, pg 1758.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

9

A charge, usu. monetary, imposed by the government on persons, entities, transactions, or property to yield public revenue. Most broadly, the term embraces all governmental impositions on the person, property, privileges, occupations, and enjoyment of the people, and includes duties, imposts, and excises. Although a tax is often thought of as being pecuniary in nature, it is not necessarily payable in money. "Taxes (including, in the term, assessments) are burdens or charges imposed by the legislature, or under its authority, upon persons or property, to raise money for public, as distinguished from private purposes, or to accomplish some end or object public in its nature." 2 John F. Dillon, Commentaries on the Law of Municipal Corporations 727-28 (3d ed. 1881). "Taxes are the enforced proportional contributions from persons and property, levied by the state by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of government and for all public needs. This definition of taxes, often referred to as 'Cooley's definition,' has been quoted and indorsed, or approved, expressly or otherwise, by many different courts. While this definition of taxes characterizes them as 'contri-butions,' other definitions refer to them as 'imposts,' 'duty or impost,' "charges,' 'burdens,' or 'exactions'; but these variations in phraseology are of no practical importance." 1 Thomas M. Cooley, The Law of Taxation 5 1, at 61-63 (Clark A. Nichols ed., , 4th ed. 1924).

39) In the said definition it is emphasized taxes are enforced

proportional contributions from the persons and property levied by

the State by virtue of its sovereignty for the support of the

government and for all public needs.

40) Therefore it is obvious that taxes are paid by the public to benefit

the State affairs and to make use of it for the betterment of the

public.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

10

41) Further, it is interesting to read the interpretation given by N.S.

Bindra in his book of Interpretation of Statutes.2

42) Bindra has defined and expressed taxation as follows3;

"The concept of a welfare state is that the state is entitled to make a levy even against the will of the people sought to be benefited. Therefore, it is of no relevance that the person sought to be benefited by the Act does not consider it to be so, In a taxing provision if there are two possible constructions of the words of the statute then effect is to be given to the one that favours the citizen and not the one that imposes a burden on him. If there is authority to impose taxes after doing a certain act, the State cannot impose the taxes unless that act is done and the authority must show, if challenged, that the act was done. Thus, in Commissioner Central Excise and Customs v Larsen and Toubro Ltd the Supreme Court was required to decide whether service tax could be levied upon indivisible work contracts before the Finance Act of 2007, which expressly made work contracts taxable. The Supreme Court answered the question against the revenue on the reasoning that composite work contracts combine sale of goods and services. Whilst the former was taxable by the States, the second could be taxed by the Centre. In the absence of an express legislative demarcation between the Centre and the States, such a tax could not be levied.

43) Further, he has reiterated Rule of Determining Tax Liability as

follows4;

Cases under the taxing Acts always resolve themselves into the question whether or not the words of the Act have reached the alleged subject of taxation. In construing a taxing statute one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is no equity about a tax. There is no room for any intendment. There is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in and nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used. When a transaction is embodied in a

2 N S Brinda, Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Ed,2017

3 N S Brinda, Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Ed,2017 pg.860

4 N S Brinda, Interpretation of Statutes, 12th Ed,2017 pg.862

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

11

document the taxing statute has to be applied in accordance with the legal rights of the parties to the transaction, and the liability to tax depends upon the meaning and content of the language used in accordance with the ordinary rules of construction.

44) To support his rules, he has cited a judgement of Lord Cairn. I

reproduce the said judgement as follows5;

"As I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation, it

is this: If the person sought to be taxed comes within

the letter of the law, he must be taxed, however great

the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On

the other hand, if the crown, seeking to recover the tax,

cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law, the

subject is free; however apparently within the spirit of

the law, the case might otherwise appear to be. In other

words, if there be admissible, in any statute, what is

called an equitable construction, certainly such a

construction is not admissible in a taxing statute, where

you can simply adhere to the words of the statute.

45) There too, it is specified, taxation should be applied in accordance

with the legal rights of the parties to the transaction. Further it is

an understood principle in the aforesaid legal literature that tax is

imposed for the welfare of the State and the State is entitled to make

a levy even against the will of the people, to benefit the public.

Therefore, the assessment of tax and the payment of tax should not

be undermined by a party.

II) Has the Petitioner disclosed all her income for the assessment

years 2008/2009 to 2013/2014 as per P29 (a) and (b) notices?

46) The question that had arisen in the instant Writ application is

whether the Petitioner has defaulted tax payments referred to in the

additional notices of assessment issued by the Respondents which is

marked and produced as P1(a) to P1(f).

47) The argument raised by the Petitioner is that the Petitioner had

already settled all the payment of taxes which were referred to in the

additional notices and those matters had been looked into by the tax

department at the interview held with the Petitioner by the Assessor.

The notes of the said interview are marked and produced as P9.

48) However, the said position was vehemently objected for and denied

by the Counsel for the Respondents as P9 does not carry the name

of the person who conducted the said inquiry and the Respondents

were confounded by the reliefs granted in P9.

49) Therefore, the Respondents have brought to the notice of court that

an assessor cannot grant the reliefs mentioned in P9 and that does

not prevent the Respondents from issuing additional notices of

assessments based on the information received by the Respondents

and after detecting the relevant documents pertinent to the

additional income for which the Petitioner had failed to answer

truthfully.

50) The Petitioner had submitted tax returns for the years 2008/2009 to

2013/2014 which are marked and produced by the Respondent as

1R1 (a) to 1R1 (f).

51) The question that had arisen was whether the Petitioner had

submitted accurate information on the said tax returns. On that the

Petitioner had deliberately defaulted and evaded due payment of

income tax to the Department of Inland Revenue.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

13

52) The said matter was identified by the Respondents. 06 notices of

assessments had been issued to the Petitioner which is already

referred to as P1 (a) to P1 (f).

53) The said assessment notices had contained that the Petitioner had

failed to submit the rent and salary income. After the issuance of

the said notices as the Petitioner had not responded, the

Respondents had issued P2 (a) to P2(c) tax default notices for the

unpaid taxes. The Petitioner had failed to honour the said notices

as well.

54) As the Petitioner has evaded the payment after the default notice,

the Respondent had issued further notices and reminder letter to

the Petitioner which is marked and produced as P4 and P5.

55) As the Petitioner has failed to reply to the said letters, the

Respondents had taken steps to institute an action before the

Magistrate Court of Anuradhapura based on the certificate of tax

default which is marked and produced as P29 (a) and P29 (b).

56) The said position is strongly objected to by the counsel for the

Petitioner. The position taken by the counsel for the Petitioner is,

that the Petitioner had already settled all the overdue taxes

referenced in the additional notice of assessment. Therefore, it is

illegal and arbitrary to issue such assessment notices for which the

Petitioner is not liable to make any payment.

57) Further, the Petitioners contention was the statute only provides to

issue additional assessments and not multiple additional

assessments. The Petitioner has relied on P9 notes, where the

Petitioner had participated for an interview and an assessor had

considered the payments made by the Petitioner and had granted

reliefs referred to in the said notes.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

14

58) In considering the aforesaid position, I draw my attention to the

Provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006. Section

163(1)(a) and (b) states as follows ;

(1) Where any person who in the opinion of an Assessor

is liable to any income tax for any year of assessment,

has not paid such tax or has paid an amount less than

the proper amount which he ought to have paid as such

tax for such year of assessment, an Assessor may,

subject to the provisions of subsection (3) and (5) and

after the fifteenth day of November immediately

succeeding that year of assessment, assess the amount

which in the judgment of the Assessor ought to have

been paid by such person, and shall by notice in writing

require such person to pay forthwith -

(a) the amount of tax so assessed, if such

person has not paid any tax for that year of

assessment; or

(b) the difference between the amount of tax

so assessed and the amount of tax paid by

such person for that year of assessment, if

such person has paid any amount as tax for

that year of assessment:

59) The Provisions referred to in the aforesaid section are absolutely

clear; if a person has paid an amount lesser than the proper

amount which he ought to have paid, the assessor can assess the

difference and the amount that he ought to pay or the difference

between the amount can be taxed.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

15

60) Therefore, the position taken by the Petitioner cannot be sustained

as the Provisions of the Inland Revenue Act is clear and it

supersedes the facts pertinent to the Petitioners case.

61) On the said grounds, additional assessment had been issued to the

Petitioner. The said assessment should be paid by the Petitioner

unless the Commissioner General of the Department of Inland

Revenue holds the payable of the said tax under Section 173(5) and

Section 173 (6) of the Inland Revenue Act.

62) The said Sections are reproduced as follows;

(5); Where any assessment has been made on any

person for any year of assessment by an Assessor, the

amount of the tax as specified in the notice of

assessment shall, for the purposes of subsection (3), be

deemed to be the tax payable by that person for that

year of assessment.

(6); Tax shall be paid notwithstanding any appeal

against the assessment, unless the Commissioner-

General orders that payment of tax or any part thereof

be held over pending the determination of such appeal,

and the amount of the tax or part thereof so held over

shall not be deemed to be in default.

63) Further, it is specified under Section 173(6) the Petitioner should

pay the assessed tax despite preferring an appeal.

64) In the instant action although the notice of assessment, tax in

default letters and reminders were issued, the Petitioner had failed

to lodge an appeal. Instead, the Petitioner objected and sent a

request letter to cancel the assessment notice, relying upon the P9

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

16

interview notes, which had been conducted without following the

proper rules and regulations of the Inland Revenue Act.

65) On perusal of P9 document as the Deputy Solicitor General argued

there is no name of the assessor who conducted the said interview

with the Petitioner and the agent of the Petitioner. The manner in

which the reliefs had been granted cannot be accepted as a normal

interview conducted by an assessor.

66) Further, the signature on the said P9 interview notes is not known

to the Respondents.

67) Therefore, the said document had created suspicion and doubt that

it had been conducted by an assessor who is not known to the

Respondents. It also should be noted that this is a departmental

document which had been obtained by the Petitioner which is also

questionable. Thus, taking disciplinary actions or quashing P9 is a

matter for the Department of Inland Revenue.

68) After auditing the documents relevant to the assessment and

documents produced by the Petitioner, the Respondents came to the

conclusion that the Petitioner had failed to provide correct

information regarding the Payment of Tax.

69) It should be noted that this case is not an appeal from the decision

taken by the Inland Revenue Department or the Tax Appeal

Commission. This is a Writ application to quash the seizure notices

and to amend the certificate of tax by issuing a Writ of Certiorari. I

will discuss later, if the Respondents had acted in accordance to the

Provisions of the Inland Revenue Act and had not violated any legal

rights of the Petitioner and/or no illegalities had been conducted,

whether the Petitioner has the right to pursue the Writ of Certiorari

in this application.

70) However, the Petitioner in his petition and in the submissions had

challenged that the Respondents have acted illegally and or

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

17

committed wrongful acts in respect of the Petitioners tax

assessments.

71) Counsel for the Petitioner tried to emphasize that the issuance of

P10 additional notice of assessment is illegal. Further the

Respondents requested that the Petitioner to be present at an

interview for the assessment years 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. The

said assessment P12 had been served with notice to the Petitioners

Madewachchiya address.

72) From the outset the Petitioner had taken up the position that the

Petitioner had shifted to Baudhaloka Mawatha Colombo 07.

Therefore, she did not get the said letters of assessment at the

correct time. Although the Petitioner had taken up this position, the

Petitioner had failed to inform the Inland Revenue Department of the

change of address and she had continued to proceed with the

interview with the same address in the letters written to the Deputy

Commissioner of Inland Revenue by P15, P16, P25 written in the

year 2019 and 2020.

73) Therefore, the Petitioners position that she did not receive the

additional notices of assessments and further reminders sent by the

Department of Inland Revenue cannot be accepted.

74) Considering the arguments and the submissions made by the

Respondents, the Respondents had taken steps to issue the

additional assessment notices after considering all the documents

tendered by the Petitioner and identifying that the Petitioner had

failed to disclose the purchase of property in Colombo 06 and

Colombo 07 and purchase of jewelry and rental incomes. The

counsel for the Petitioner argued that the Colombo 06 property was

purchased in 2006. However the Petitioners contention was that

the Colombo 06 and 07 properties were gifted by the father of the

Petitioner.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

18

75) The said position taken by the Petitioner had failed as the

Petitioners fathers tax file had been misplaced and could not be

traced and the funds utilized to purchase the properties were not

disclosed properly by the Petitioner. As per the Respondents there

were no other documents to prove that the Petitioners father had

purchased the said properties. Thus, the tax pertinent to the said

properties had been included in the additional assessments.

76) When considering the Petitioners stand that multiple assessments

had been issued against her cannot be accepted as the Respondents

have acted according to the Provisions of the Inland Revenue Act.

After calling for documents and interviewing the Petitioner and the

agent, the Respondents had come to the conclusion that the

aforesaid incorrect information and tax returns had been submitted

by the Petitioner.

77) The Respondents have issued 1R10 amended notice of assessment

after deducting the payments made by the Petitioner. Further,

considering the request made by the Petitioner dated 24th July 2020

the amended tax certificates 1R14 and 1R15 had been issued.

78) The Counsel for the Respondents had relied that the said amended

assessment and tax certificates had been issued after holding the

interview with the Petitioner and in considering the payments made

after the impugned P9 interview notes. To my view those are not

multiple assessments or tax certificates.

79) The narrow view of the Petitioner is that the Respondents have acted

illegally and issued multiple assessments which cannot be accepted.

80) Furthermore, the Petitioner had objected to the assessments prior to

receiving the same.

81) On the said grounds, the written objections sent by the Petitioner

cannot be accepted as an appeal as the assessment notices were not

submitted by the Respondents.

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

19

82) At this stage I draw my attention to Section 165 of the Inland

Revenue Act.

83) The said Section reads as follows;

(1)Any person who is aggrieved by the amount of an

assessment made under this Act or by the amount of

any valuation for the purposes of this Act may, within a

period of thirty days after the date of the notice of

assessment, appeal to the Commissioner-General

against such assessment or valuation:

Provided that the Commissioner-General, upon being

satisfied that owing to absence from Sri Lanka,

sickness or other reasonable cause, the appellant was

prevented from appealing within such period, shall

grant an extension of time for preferring the appeal.

(2) Every appeal shall be preferred by a petition in

writing addressed to the Commissioner-General and

shall state precisely the grounds of such appeal.

(3) Where the assessment appealed against has been

made in the absence of a return, the petition of appeal

shall be sent together with a return duly made.

84) It is abundantly clear on the aforesaid Provision, if a person is

aggrieved by the assessment or valuation, within a period of 30 days

after the notice of the date of the assessment, can appeal to the

Commissioner General.

85) The Petitioner in the instant action had not made use of the said

provision and the appeal against the assessment or valuation had

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

20

not been made. Therefore, the Respondents had correctly specified

that the appealable period had already lapsed.

86) On the said context, my considered view is that the Respondents

had not violated any provisions of the Inland Revenue Act when

taking steps against the Petitioner.

III) If not, can the Petitioner maintain this application to

obtain reliefs under Writ Jurisdiction?

87) This is an application that the Petitioner has instituted to obtain

reliefs under the Writ of Certiorari.

88) The Writ of Certiorari is defined in Dr. Sunil Coorays Book of

Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka 6 as follows;

Quashing by certiorari is only declaratory of the legal

position where it is an invalid act that is quashed,

Quashing by certiorari for error of law on face of record.

Is constitutive, not merely declaratory,

Quashing only the bad which is severable from the good

which is left intact, like in an appeal,

Unlike in an appeal, no substitution of good order for

the bad one,

Once decision is quashed by certiorari, fresh decision

may, and must when so urged be made, if necessary

after fresh inquiry, except when there was no

jurisdiction

89) The Petitioner had sought in the instant action to issue a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the notices of default marked and produced as

63rd Ed Vol 2 Pg 769

C.A. WRIT 0312 -2020

21

P19 and P24 and the amended certificate of tax which is marked

and produced as P29(b).

90) These documents were issued by the Respondents acting in their

official capacity. To quash documents issued by a government

official under Writ of Certiorari the said documents should have

been issued arbitrarily, illegally or in violation of the principles of the

relevant acts under which the said documents are issued.

91) In the instant application on the perusal of the documents and the

interview notes I do not see that the Respondents have acted

illegally, arbitrarily and/or in violation of the Provisions of the Inland

Revenue Act.

92) As I have stated above, this is a Writ application and not a tax

appeal. However, parties have gone beyond their limits explaining

the calculation of the tax to be payable and to quash the tax notices.

93) The main context is to overview that the Respondents have acted

arbitrarily, illegally and or without following the provisions of the

Inland Revenue Act and issued P19, P24 and P29 (b) notices and

amended tax certificate.

94) However, the documents issued by the Respondents had been

issued after considering the assessments forwarded by the

Petitioner. Further, the Respondents have acted upon considering

the P9 notes, a doubtful interview which had been conducted

without referring to the assessors name and granted concessions

which under the normal circumstances could not have occurred.

95) In the said circumstances as I have reiterated above, I do not see

any violation on the part of the Respondents issuing P19, P24 and

P29 (b) documents.

96) At this stage, I draw my attention to the following decision.

Lordship the Chief Justice in the said judgement had referred to as

follows;

It is a cardinal maxim that every power has legal

limits, however wide the language of the empowering

Act. If the Court finds that the power has been exercised

oppressively or unreasonably, or if there has been some

procedural failing, such as not allowing a person

affected to put forward his case, the act may be

condemned as unlawful. There are no absolute or

unfettered discretions in public law; discretions are

conferred on public functionaries in trust for the public,

to be used for the public good, and the propriety of the

exercise of such discretions is to be judged by reference

to the purposes for which they were so entrusted.

97) Further, Justice Palakidnar in the case of Podimahtthaya V the Land Reform Commission8 had said that;

On the more basic circumstance of the interference of

this Court by a writ, one must examine whether there

was reasonableness This Court can interfere where

there is manifest unreasonableness in an

administrative act. The test is whether the

administrative authority has acted within the rules of

reason and justice. The conduct of the administrative

authority must be legal and regular as one correlates

the acts complained about to the powers given under

the statute.

98) In the said decision it is decided a person who is entitled to obtain a

Writ has to prove the illegality of the government official.

99) I note it is decided in the following judgement of Mendis v. Seema

Sahitha Panadura Janatha SanthakaPravahanaSevaya and

Others9Justice Sarath N. Silva, J. expressed that;

It is clear these Writs come within the purview of

administrative law which is a branch of law that has

been developed by courts for the control of the exercise

of governmental or statutory powers by mainly public

authorities.... Writs of Certiorari and Prohibition are

instruments of Public Law to quash and restrain illegal

governmental and administrative action.

The essential ingredient is that a member of the public

who is affected by such a decision has to submit to the

jurisdiction of the authority whose action is subject to

review. In other words, there is an unequal relationship

between the authority wielding power and the

individual who has to submit to the jurisdiction of that

authority.

100) Moreover, in Hapuarachchi and Others Vs Commissioner of

Elections and Another10 Dr. Shirani Bandaranayake, J. held that;

To deprive a person of knowing the reasons for a

decision which affects him would not only be arbitrary,

but also a violation of his right to equal protection of the

law.

On a consideration of our case law and in the light of

the attitude taken by Courts in other countries, it is

quite clear that giving reasons for an administrative

decision is an important feature in todays context,

which cannot be lightly disregarded. Moreover in a

situation, where giving reasons have been ignored, such

a body would run the risk of having acted arbitrarily, in

coming to their conclusion.

101) In considering the aforesaid decisions it is obvious that the

Petitioner is not entitled to obtain a Writ of Certiorari in the instant

application as the Respondents have not violated any legal

provisions of the Inland Revenue Act and or acted illegally or

arbitrarily.

102) For the reasons spelt out above I would like to draw my attention to

a phrase referred to in Blacks Law Dictionary11. The reference

includes the Latin term Nemo est supra leges, which means "no

one is above the laws."

103) Thus, in the instant action although I have decided that there are no

grounds supported to invoke the Writ Jurisdiction, at the same time,

considering the payment of tax it is imposed by the Legislature,

people who are governed by the said Legislature are bound to make

the payment and no one should evade it, as that is how the State

mechanism functions to benefit the public.
