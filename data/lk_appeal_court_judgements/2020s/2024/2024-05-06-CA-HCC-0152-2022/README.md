Being aggrieved by the above conviction and the sentence the appellant has

preferred this appeal.

The Facts in Brief

The victim of this incident of rape has given evidence as PW-01 at the trial. She

was 71 years of age when the trial commenced on 18-12-2019. She was a

widowed mother of two grown up children. She was living alone in her house

during the time relevant to this incident. On 17-11-2016 around 6.30 p.m. in

the evening, she has been cleaning her cooking utensils just outside of the house.

There was a slight drizzle at that time.

According to her evidence, the appellant who suddenly appeared from the

direction of the latrine situated next to the house had forcibly lifted her and taken

her inside the house. Although his face had been covered with a t-shirt, he is

alleged to have said , while in the process of forcibly

taking her inside the house.

The mentioned Mala was a neighbor, who had a close relationship with her. She

has known the appellant for over 12 years by that time. It has been her evidence

that the appellant removed his face cover while committing the act on her, where

she was able to clearly see his face. After taking her to the room of the house, he

has pushed her onto the bed, forcibly lifted the clothes she was wearing and had

Page 4 of 18

removed his clothes as well. It has been her evidence that, he forced her to engage

in oral sex initially, and subsequently had sexual intercourse with her.

It is clear from the way she has narrated the incident of rape; she has been

reluctant to describe it in conventional terms. She has used gestures towards

her female sexual organ and has described the sexual intercourse committed by

the appellant. She has been very specific that although the room had no

electricity, since it was not dark at that time and because of the open room

windows, she was clearly able to identify the appellant positively. She has stated

that although she struggled with the attacker, she could not escape his grip, and

though she screamed seeking help, no one heard her.

After engaging in sexual intercourse with her, the appellant has threatened her

not to tell anyone, and has stated that if you tell anyone, I will kill you and I will

also go to the camp and shoot myself. The victim had known that the appellant

was serving in the army at that time.

On the following day the victim has gone to the house of her neighbour, and had

informed the lady of the house the incident. This has resulted in the husband of

the lady, giving a call to her daughter stating that her mother has faced an

incident of this nature. After hearing the news, the daughter has come and gone

to the house of the appellant to confront him, but since her daughter had been

threatened, both the victim and her daughter have gone to the police.

However, it has been her evidence that, when she went to the police for the first

time, she did not inform the police about the rape incident committed by the

appellant, but the complaint had been to the effect of harassment. She has

explained the reason saying that she was reluctant to come out with what

happened to her because of the shame she felt and even did not tell the full

incident in detail initially to her children due to the same reason.

This initial complaint has resulted in the police summoning the appellant and

arranging for a settlement between the parties. However, when she and her

daughter returned home, she has been subjected to threats by the sister of the

Page 5 of 18

appellant, on the basis that the victim caused embarrassment to them and she

will face consequences. There had been an incident of throwing stones at the

house as well, after this incident.

This has resulted in the victim making a second complaint on 28-11-2016, as to

the incident of rape committed by the appellant to her.

The defence taken up by the appellant at the trial, had been a complete denial

of the incident.

Under cross-examination, the prosecutrix has well explained the light condition

of the house at that time, and she was able to clearly identify the appellant as

the person who committed the rape on her. She has also well explained the delay

in making a complaint of rape, and the reasons for her initial complaint about

harassment and not about a rape, stating that she was ashamed of what

happened and the repercussions it may bring to her and her family and also the

fear as a person living alone in a house. Explaining what she said to her neighbor

on the following day, she has stated that what she told her was that Malas son

came and harassed because she felt embarrassed.

The Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who examined the victim on 28-11-2016,

some 10 days after the alleged incident, has given evidence and submitted his

Medico-Legal Report (MLR) as P-01. In giving the history of the incident, the

victim had informed the doctor that she was forced to have sexual intercourse

by a person named Indika, meaning the appellant, and has described the

incident in very much similar manner, as stated by her in her evidence before

the High Court. The JMO has only seen a redness around the vulva of the victim

in the genital examination.

However, he has expressed the opinion that due to the delay of the examination,

penile penetration cannot be excluded or proven, and has observed psychological

disturbances in the victim when he examined her. When giving evidence, the

JMO has expressed the opinion that a redness he observed at the vulva of the

Page 6 of 18

victim which can be a result of a forcible sexual assault or even due to natural

causes like scratching or some other reason.

PW-02 called to give evidence, had been the neighbour to whom the victim has

gone and informed about the incident on the following day. The victim has come

to her house around 1.00 p.m. on that day and had informed her that, while she

was washing her pots and pans around 7.00 p.m. on the previous day, Indika

whom she knew as a person from the village, came and forced her inside the

house. She has identified the appellant as the person named Indika. It has been

her evidence that other than that the victim did not divulge any further details

to her.

The daughter of the victim has given evidence as PW-03. It has been her evidence

that on 18-11-2016, a neighbor of her mother gave her a call and informed her

that her mother has faced an incident and to come. When inquired, she has been

informed that Indika has done something vulgar to her. This has resulted in her

visiting the mother on the same day and when questioned, the mother has cried.

When questioned further, mother has informed that the appellant used to come

and attempt to get into the house previously as well, and on the 17th he came

and harassed and committed rape on her. She has identified the person named

Indika as the appellant.

It has been her evidence that, the mother initially did not inform the full incident

to her, but only subsequently she told her what happened. She has admitted

that the initial complaint made by her mother was only regarding a harassment

and not about the rape. She has admitted that the complaint of rape was made

on the 28-11-2016 and that was after the members of the family of the appellant

started harassing her mother for making a complaint against the appellant. She

has stated that the mother did not want to complain about the rape committed

on her due to shame, and that was the reason why the initial complaint was only

about the harassment by the appellant.

Page 7 of 18

The prosecution has closed its case after calling the relevant police officers who

conducted the investigations in relation to the incident.

When the appellant was called upon for a defence, he has chosen to make a

statement from the dock. He has stated that he is not guilty to the offence and

at the time of this complaint, he was doing a good job in the army and when he

was at home on leave, the police came and informed him about a complaint

against him by the appellant for harassment and the matter was settled at the

police station.

It had been his position that, there had been a dispute after that with his sister

by the prosecutrix and her daughter, which resulted in the complaint made on

28-11-2016. He has pleaded that he did not commit the offence.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant urged the

following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court:

1. The learned High Court Judge has relied on inadmissible evidence to

convict the appellant.

2. The evidence of the PW-01 fails the test of credibility.

3. The learned High Court Judge has relied on evidence not made

available before the trial Court.

4. The learned High Court Judge has not evaluated the evidence

impartially and independently.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

Since all four grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider

the said grounds collectively.

It was the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that, the

prosecution has failed to establish the penile penetration which is an essential

ingredient to prove a charge of rape, and the evidence in that regard had been

Page 8 of 18

elicited by putting leading questions to the victim which has resulted in a denial

of a fair trial towards the appellant.

In order to prove a charge under section 364(1) of the Penal Code, the

prosecution must prove the following ingredients beyond reasonable doubt.

1. Sexual intercourse was committed to the woman.

2. Sexual intercourse was committed to the woman by the accused-

appellant.

3. Sexual intercourse was committed to the woman without her consent

or against her will.

It appears that the contention of the learned Counsel that the prosecution has

failed to prove the penile penetration had been based on the reluctance of the

victim (PW-01) to come out as to what happened to her at the trial, where she

has not directly stated about penile penetration.

However, if one looks at her evidence in the correct perspective, it becomes

abundantly clear from what she has stated had been that the appellant inserted

his penis into her vagina without her consent.

For matters of clarity, I would now reproduce some of the evidence of the victim

in that regard.

If one considers the above highlighted portions of the evidence as a whole, it

would clearly show that what the witness has stated was that the appellant had

sexual intercourse with her against her will. Hence, I am not in a position to

agree with the submission of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the

prosecutrix has failed to speak about the penile penetration.

Page 10 of 18

The learned Counsel submitted further that, the relevant evidence has been

elicited from the prosecutrix by putting leading questions to her and that has

denied a fair trial towards the appellant.

There again, I am not in a position to agree. It is clear that the victim has spoken

about what happened to her stating that the appellant had forcible sexual

intercourse with her, although she has not stated that in direct terms, but

indirectly when giving her evidence. It clearly appears that, the learned

prosecuting State Counsel, in order to get a clear explanation as to what she

narrated before the Court, has put questions to her, not with the intention of

getting something out of her mouth that was not told by her to Court.

I am of the view that, this procedure has not dented the credibility of the evidence

of the prosecutrix. She being an old woman and a reluctant witness with a village

background, some persuasion for her to come out with what happened in detail

would be necessary, and I do not see that as denying a fair trial towards the

appellant.

Ranjith Silva, J. considering the way to assess credibility of a victim of a sexual

crime stated in Perera Vs. The Attorney General (2012) 1 SLR page 74,

It is inconceivable that one could apply the tests of contemporaneity or

spontaneity in rape matters especially in child rape matters. A perusal of

the proceeding itself will give an indication as to how reluctant the victim

was to come out with the story at the trial in the High Court. A fair amount

of coaxing and persuasion which justified under the circumstances was

needed to extract the evidence from the victim

Another matter that should attract consideration is, whether the delay in making

the complaint of rape and also not coming out with incident of rape in the initial

complaint made by the prosecutrix to the police has shaken the credibility of the

evidence adduced before the trial Court.

Page 11 of 18

It is an admitted fact that the initial complaint by the prosecutrix was of

harassment and was not of rape. Accordingly, police have summoned both

parties and has settled the matter.

The prosecutrix has explained the reasoning behind making a complaint of

harassment initially, stating that she was ashamed of what happened and since

she was living alone in her home and also because of the death threats made to

her by the appellant she only complaint about harassments by the appellant

believing that it would stop him from further harassing her.

However, it appears that subsequent to the settlement, the family members of

the appellant have threatened the prosecutrix and her family of legal action on

the basis that she caused insult to their family. This has led to her making the

second complaint, giving in detail what happened at the hands of the appellant.

The evidence of the neighbour clearly establishes the fact that the prosecutrix

has gone and informed her that the appellant came to her house while she was

washing her pots and pans and forced her inside the house. Although she has

not given much detail, the evidence of the prosecutrix is clear that she has been

reluctant to come out as to what really happened due to the factors I have

considered before. Even to her own daughter, she has been reluctant to inform

what happened.

It appears that although the daughter was made to understand what really

happened, she has gone along with the prosecutrixs intention not to pursue the

matter for various obvious reasons.

When considering the evidence in its totality, I am of the view that, the victims

initial reaction to the incident can be justified given the facts and circumstances

unique to this case.

Page 12 of 18

In the case of Bandara Vs. The State (2001) 2 SLR 63 it was held that;

If there is a valid reason or explanation for the delay and if the trial judge

is satisfied with the reasons and the explanations given, no trial judge

would apply the test of spontaneity and contemporaneity and reject the

testimony of a witness in such circumstances. Delayed witnesses evidence

could be acted upon if there were reasons to explain the delay

Discrepancies and inconsistencies, which do not relate to the core of the

prosecution case ought to be disregarded, especially when all probabilities

factor echoes in favour of the version narrated by a witness.

In the case of D. Tikiri Banda Vs. The Attorney General, Bar Association Law

Reports 2010 (V.L.R.) 92 it was held that;

If delay of making a statement is explainable, the evidence of a witness

should not be rejected on that ground alone.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that, the prosecutrix has

well explained the reasons for her not stating that she was raped in her initial

complaint to the police and of the view that has not caused any doubt about the

credibility of the version of events as narrated by the prosecutrix.

When the prosecutrix commenced her evidence at the trial, she has stated that

she came to give evidence about the thief who entered the house and had

thereafter narrated about the events that took place on the day of the incident.

The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that, this shows the

inconsistency of the evidence by the prosecutrix. However, I am not in a position

to agree. The very fact of the way the prosecutrix commenced her evidence shows

that she was very much reluctant to come out in open Court in greater detail as

to what happened to her. Being a villager who has no exposure to this kind of an

incident, her evidence has to be considered in its totality and not in its isolation.

If taken in its totality, it is clear that the way the victim commenced her evidence

was not a reason to consider that her evidence was inconsistent.

Page 13 of 18

The learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the version of the

prosecutrix as to how she was able to identify the perpetrator as the appellant,

was not probable.

He was of the view that being a person well known to the prosecutrix, no

perpetrator of a crime of this nature will remove the cover he had on his face and

expose himself to the victim if he was forcibly committing rape on her.

I am of the view that, this again is a matter that has to be considered in its

totality. The evidence of the prosecutrix has been that when she was washing

her pots and pans outside of the house around 6.30 in the evening, a person

jumped in front of her suddenly and took her inside the house. She has stated

that the person had his face covered by using a t-shirt. However, while the sexual

act was in progress the perpetrator has removed his cover and threatened the

prosecutrix with death if she reveals this incident to anyone.

Although the light condition at that time was not bright sunlight, the prosecutrix

has given clear evidence as to the identity, because she knew the appellant well.

It has been her evidence that on previous occasions too, the appellant attempted

to enter her house and he could not succeed. This may be the very reason why

the initial complaint was made on the basis of harassment, rather than of an

incident of rape.

I am of the view that, when a person is so engrossed of a sexual act of this nature,

there is a high probability for such a person to commit an error while in the act

by exposing his identity believing that the victim may not complain due to fear

or due to several other possible factors.

The evidence has established the fact that, the nearest house to the house of the

prosecutrix had been about 40 meters away and the place of the incident was an

isolated spot. The appellant being a person well conversant with the geography

of the area, would know that his actions would go unnoticed to others, which

may be the reason why he has committed the attack on the prosecutrix in the

manner stated by her.

Page 14 of 18

Under the circumstances, I find that the evidence of the prosecutrix as to the

way she was able to identify the appellant was highly probable and could be

relied upon.

The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that, since the evidence of the

prosecutrix was not cogent enough, the Court should have looked for

corroboration of the incident of rape and the learned High Court Judge was

misdirected when the doctors evidence was considered as corroboration. He

submitted that the redness observed by the JMO in the vulva of the prosecutrix

can be due to several reasons and that cannot be considered as corroborative

evidence in relation to a penile penetration. It was submitted further that such

a thing can happen due to other reasons as well, and the learned High Court

Judge has failed to appreciate that fact in its correct perspective.

However, I find that the learned High Court Judge has not decided the matter

only on the said observations by the JMO. She has considered the reasons as to

why there could be no visible marks of forcible sexual intercourse in a 68-year-

old woman, and has considered the opinion expressed by the JMO that, such an

incident cannot be overruled.

I find that this should be the approach in relation to medical evidence in a matter

of this nature.

The prosecutrix had been consistent in her version of events when she narrated

the history of the incident to the doctor. This shows that the prosecutrix has

been consistent in her version of events, which is a matter that should be

considered in favour of her evidence, although history cannot be considered as

corroboration.

At this juncture, I am reminded of the observations made by the Indian Supreme

Court in Boginbhai Hirjibhai Vs. State of Gujarat (1983) AIR S.C. 753,

wherein it was stated thus;

Page 15 of 18

In the Indian setting refusal to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual

assault in the absence of corroboration as whole is adding insult to the

injury.

It is my considered view that, any perpetrator of a sexual crime like rape or grave

sexual abuse, will commit it by making sure that no one sees his actions, and

more often than not with pre-planning. An eyewitness account of such incidents

is so rare, unless there are chance instances where somebody has seen such

incidents under unexpected circumstances.

Therefore, I am of the view that the test should be whether the victim of a crime

of this nature is telling the truth and whether her version of events is cogent

enough and trustworthy and can be acted upon.

Although there may be some discrepancies in the evidence of a victim, of a sexual

crime of this nature, that should not be viewed as the victim is telling untruth,

unless those deficiencies go into the core of the matter to make the allegation

against the accused highly improbable or false.

I find that although the case of D. Tikiri Banda Vs. AG (supra), was a case of

grave sexual abuse of a child, the determinations made are of relevance to a case

of rape as well. It was held;

Mostly victims of sexual harassment do not want to talk about the

harrowing experience and would like to forget about the incident as soon

as possible (withdrawal symptom). The offenders should not be allowed

to capitalize or take mean advantage of these natural inherent

weaknesses

Insignificant omission of such a victim or her utterance of dreadful words

should not be taken as a contradiction having effect or impact on the

credibility of the victim.

Per Ranjith Silva, J.

In the Indian as well as the Sri Lankan settings it can be safely said

that rarely will a girl or a woman make false allegations of sexual assault

Page 16 of 18

or will a mother instigate, induce or compel her small daughter to make

such allegations for fear of lasting consequences. One cannot expect her

to be so silly, not to appreciate the stigma attached and that she and the

rest of her family would be virtually ostracized for the rest of her life.

Under the circumstances of this case to suggest that the victim in this

case made a false complain against the appellant because the mother of

the victim or any member of the family had a strained relationship with

the appellant or any member of his family is totally unacceptable.

I would like to express similar sentiments in relation to the evidence of the

prosecutrix in this case as well. There is no probability of her making a false

allegation of rape given her age and the relevant facts and circumstances, and

the stigma attached to such a thing becoming common knowledge.

Another matter raised by the learned Counsel for the appellant was that, the

learned High Court Judge has considered evidence not available on record in

favor of the prosecution.

He referred to what had been stated by the learned High Court Judge at page 04

of the judgment (page 117 of the appeal brief) to the effect that the evidence of

PW-02, who was the neighbour of the victim, and also that of PW-04 the daughter

of the victim, has corroborated the evidence of victim to argue that none of the

witnesses have come out with the fact that they were told about the incident of

rape by the victim.

However, the careful scrutiny of the judgment shows that, the determination had

not been that the victim told them that she was raped.

It was the evidence of PW-02, that although the victim did not tell her that she

was raped, she told her that the appellant came and dragged her inside the

house. The daughter of the victim has been informed by the victim that she was

harassed and had come out with the incident of rape later. The learned High

Court Judge has considered their evidence only in that context and nothing else.

Page 17 of 18

Hence, I am in no position to agree that the evidence of the mentioned two

witnesses had been considered on the basis of something not mentioned in their

evidence.

For the reasons considered as above, I find that the learned High Court Judge

was well aware as to the manner in which the evidence in a criminal case against

an accused person should be considered and the requirement of proving the case

beyond reasonable doubt.

The judgement clearly demonstrates that the learned High Court Judge has

considered whether the basic ingredients that should be proved in a case of rape

has been established beyond reasonable doubt. The question whether penile

penetration has been established, whether the victim has identified the appellant

positively and the probability and the credibility factors of the evidence of the

prosecutrix has been well considered by analyzing the evidence in that regard.

The learned High Court Judge has also considered the delay in making the

complaint and whether there should be corroboration as to the evidence of the

prosecutrix.

After having satisfied that the prosecution has established a strong pima facie

case against the appellant, for which I am in full agreement, the learned High

Court Judge has considered whether the defence taken up by the appellant has

created a reasonable doubt against the evidence of the prosecution or has

provided acceptable explanation as to the evidence against him.

Having considered the dock statement made by the appellant and the value that

can be attached to such a dock statement, and the evidence placed before the

Court, the learned High Court Judge has considered that no doubt has been

created or reasonable explanation has been provided in relation to the charge

against the appellant.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has come to a correct determination in

convicting the appellant to the charge preferred against him.

Page 18 of 18

Accordingly, I find no reasons to interfere with the conviction and the sentence

of the learned High Court Judge.

The appeal is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence dated 28-07-2022 is

affirmed.

Since it was informed that the appellant is on bail pending appeal granted from

the High Court, it is directed that the sentence of the appellant shall commence

from the day this judgment is pronounced upon the appellant by the learned

High Court Judge of Kegalle.
