The land which forms the subject matter of this application is a portion of land co-owned

by the Petitioner and her sisters. According to the Petitioner, Somewhere around in

October 2014, Officers from the Government Survey Department, entered the premises to

carry out the survey to the said land. According to the Petitioner, only her mother was

present at that time. Therefore, they were not in a position to recall as to whether the

notice was affixed to the property.

Later they admitted, that the section 2 notice was served to them and the said notice was

published in all 3 languages. According to the Petitioner, after 8 years, they have received

a letter dated 21.12.2022 indicating that, lots 1,2 and 3 depicted in the Plan No.

KA/BRW/14/265 had been acquired by the order made under the proviso to the section 38

Page 4 of 7

of the Land Acquisition Act for the Beruwala Maradana Anchorage and to handover

vacant position on 16.01.2023.

The Petitioner has challenged the particular gazette notification No. 2240/26 dated 12th

August 2021 on the basis that there is a long delay to fulfil the Public purpose of

constructing an anchorage at Maradana Beruwala. On the other hand, the Respondent

has stated that, subsequent to the survey conducted by the Survey Department on the

request of the 2nd Respondent they have come to know that, the extent of land which was

to be acquired had been greater in extent than the portion of land that was originally

depicted in the said notice. Therefore, steps were taken to exhibit a fresh notice, regarding

to the additional portion of the land. According to the Grama Niladhari who has informed

the 2nd Respondent, that the notice was purportedly exhibited. Further the Respondents

have pleaded that, the anchorage which was primarily constructed adjacent to the coast

line and established in the impugned land had been declared open on 20.01.2016. They

have further stated that, since a larger land to be acquired, there had been a requirement

to obtain fresh assessment of expenditure with regard to the acquisition of the said land.

Therefore, they sought approval under financial regulation No 53 for the revision of the

valuation of the land. They admit the fact that, between 2015 to 2021 there were multiple

administrative issues that has to be looked into by the relevant officials which resulted

the delay to complete the project. According to the Respondent, they have utilized the

portion of land (described in the earlier notice) for the purpose for which it was acquired.

The main argument put forward by the Petitioner was that, since no steps have been

taken by the Respondent to construct the anchorage, there was no need for the minister

to act under section 38A of the Land Acquisition Act to take over the immediate possession

on the ground of urgency.

Section 38A- Immediate possession of certain lands acquired for the purposes of local

authorities.

1) Where any land is being acquired for the purposes of a local authority and the

preliminary valuation of that land made by the Chief Valuer of the Government

does not exceed the specified sum, the immediate possession of such land on the

ground of urgency, within the meaning of the proviso to section 38, shall be

deemed to have become necessary, and accordingly the Minister may make an

Order of possession under section 38 of this Act.

When we consider the above section, the decision of the Minister is based on the

urgency which initiate the Minister to make order for immediate possession.

Page 5 of 7

Therefore, to quash the said decision, the Petitioner has to satisfy this Court that,

there is no urgency for the minister to act under the section.

According to the Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance, which reads as follows;

Section 101. Whoever desires any Court to give Judgement as to any legal right or

liability dependent on the existence of facts which he asserts, must prove that

those facts exist.

This proposition was considered by Samarakoon CJ in Marie Indira

Fernandopulle and Another v. E.L. Senanayake, Minister of Lands and

Agriculture, 79 (2) NLR 115 at page 118; Chief Justice held that;

A reading of section 38 reveals that it comes into operation only after an order

under section 2 and/or section 4. Both these sections operate on the Minister's

decision under these two sections that the land is required for a public purpose.

Section 38 nowhere refers to " public purpose ". It only refers to the sections where

the need for such purpose has been decided. The only decision it is concerned with

is the " urgency" which necessitates " immediate possession " of the land being

taken. The Minister's sole power under that section is to decide the question of

urgency to meet the need for which an order was made under section 2 and/or

section 4, I therefore find myself unable to follow that decision so far it concerns

the provisions of section 38 and must respectfully disagree.

Further held that,

The next question is whether the Minister's decision regarding ' the urgency, and

therefore the need to take immediate possession, can be reviewed by Court.

Counsel for the Petitioner stated that the Court must apply an objective test and

not a subjective test. State Counsel contended for the latter. If one looks at the

entire Act two main powers are given to the Minister. They are: -

1. The power to decide whether the land is required for public purpose and to direct

that it be acquired, and

Page 6 of 7

2. Whether there is an urgency compelling the immediate possession being taken

of the land of and to direct that possession be taken.

Further held that,

No doubt primarily the Minister decided urgency. He it is who is in possession of

the facts and his must be the reasoning. But the Courts have a duty to review the

matter. In this case the need for a playground and a farm had been mooted as far

back as 1974. Political influences and extraneous forces delayed the take over of

the land.

Four years dragged on and school's needs were still waiting to be met. The delay

and the need decided the urgency. These being the facts the Petitioner has failed

to satisfy me that there was no urgency. I would therefore dismiss the application

with costs.

The above said case was considered by Sriskandharajah, J. in Sheriff and Another

v. Rajitha Senaratne and Three others, CA/WRIT application No. 2210/2003,

Decided on 14.05.2007, ( 2007 BLR 153, )

The Respondents have satisfied this Court that, after section 2 notice was published in

2014, steps were taken to set up the anchorage in the year of 2016. And also, the

Respondents have produced document ( 1R5) requesting further approval under financial

regulation. It clearly shows that, the acquisition was not abandoned. Therefore, we hold

that the Petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court that there was no urgency, when the

Minister made the impugned Order.

Further, we observe that, the Petitioner has not challenged the acquisition of the said

premises. The effect of the Order under s 38 was described in S 40 of the said Act.

Section 40- Effect of Order under section 38

When an Order of the Minister under section 38 is published in the Gazette,

a) where that Order is in regard to the taking possession of a particular land, that

land shall, by virtue of that Order, vest absolutely in the State free from all

encumbrances with effect from the date on which that Order is so published, and

Page 7 of 7

any officer who is authorised to do so by that Order may, on or after that date, take

possession of that land for and on behalf of the State; or

b) where that Order is in regard to the subjection of a particular land to a particular

servitude, that land shall be subject to that servitude, and that servitude may be

utilised for the public purpose for which it was acquired, on and after the aforesaid

date.

The above section was considered in S.M.S. Karuketiya v. S.M.P. Karuketiya and

others, CA 419-420-421/94(F), Decided on 04.06.2009, Gooneratne J. (2009) BLR at page

123 held that,

The effect of a Section 38 order under the Land Acquisition Act as referred to in Section

40 and 40A (Amended by Act No. 28 of 1964) of the said Act is to vest absolutely in the

State free from encumbrances with effect from the date of publication of the order (5R4)

and such order should be received in all courts as conclusive evidence of title of the State.

Therefore the learned District Judge should have excluded State land from the corpus in

terms of the Survevor General's Plan and the prayer to the statement of claim of the added

Defendant-Appellant.

According to the above section, it is clear that the virtue of the Order made under Section

38, the land in question vested absolutely with the State. Therefore, the quit notice issued

by the Respondents in terms of the Section 3 of the State Land (Recovery of Possession

Act) is legal. Also, we hold that the action instituted in the Magistrate Court Kalutara in

terms of State Land (Recovery of Possession Act) by the Respondent is legal.

For the above said reasons, we dismiss the action with costs.
