Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the 8th intervenient petitioner-respondent-petitioner

(hereinafter referred to as the petitioner) seeking to invoke the revisionary

jurisdiction of this Court granted to this Court in terms of Article 138 of The

Constitution.

When this matter was supported for notice and for an interim order, this Court,

having heard the parties, issued notice to the respondents mentioned, and also

issued a stay order suspending the order made by the learned Provincial High

Court Judge of the Western holden in Colombo on 25-09-2023 in High Court

Case No. HC/RA/113/2023.

At the hearing of this application, this Court heard the submissions of the

learned Counsel for the petitioner, as well as the submissions of the learned

Counsel for the 1st party respondent-respondents.

The petitioner who is the Provincial Road Development Authority of the Western

Province is seeking to revise and set aside the order dated 25-09-2023 made by

the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Western

Province Holden in the earlier mentioned application.

The impugned order has been pronounced as a sequel to an order made by the

learned High Court Judge on 21-09-2023.

The learned High Court Judge, after having considered the revision application

filed by petitioners in the above-mentioned case, which has been filed in terms

of Article 154P of The Constitution, has decided to issue notices to the

respondents mentioned in the application before the High Court.

Page 25 of 32

In the same order, having considered an application for an interim order, the

learned High Court Judge has ordered that the order dated 16-12-2022 should

be made effective as it is. However, it was also ordered that this interim order

shall not stand as a bar to the Magistrates Court to proceed with the inquiry,

and come to a final conclusion or for the parties to come to a settlement.

Although the order itself does not give any indication as to what was meant by

the order dated 16-12-2022, it is clear from the documents filed before this Court

that it was an order made by the learned Additional Magistrate of Nugegoda in

Magistrates Court on Nugegoda Case No. 11296/22, which was an order relating

to an application filed before the Court in terms of section 98(1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act, for removal of a nuisance.

The Officer-in-Charge of Maharagama police station has filed the above-

mentioned application naming 28 persons as the 1st party and 3 parties as the

2nd party.

The 1st person mentioned as the 2nd party is an individual named Samaranayake,

while the 2nd and 3rd persons mentioned had been the Secretary of the

Maharagama Urban Council and the Engineer of the Western Provincial Road

Development Authority Moratuwa. It needs to be noted that both the latter

mentioned parties are not legal personalities, but are officials of the relevant

institutions.

The public nuisance referred to by the police had been in relation to allowing

rainwater to be released into a roadway used by the 1st party, and thereby

causing a public nuisance.

The learned Additional Magistrate of Nugegoda having heard evidence from the

1st party in that regard, has made the following order on 16-12-2022, which was

the order the learned High Court Judge has directed that should be carried out.

.

Page 26 of 32

.

It appears that the learned Additional Magistrate has made the above order in

terms of section 98(1)(a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act which reads as

follows.

98. (1) Whenever a magistrate considers on receiving report or other

information and on taking such evidence (if any) as he thinks fit

(a) That any unlawful obstruction or nuisance should be removed

from any way, harbour, lake, river, or channel which is or may

be lawfully used by the public or from any public place; or

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

such Magistrate may make a conditional order requiring that the

person causing such obstruction or nuisance or carrying on such

trade or occupation or keeping any such goods or merchandise or

owning, possessing, or controlling such building, substance, tree,

tank, well or excavation shall within a time to be fixed by such order

(i) remove such obstruction or nuisance; or

(ii) suppress or remove such trade or occupation; or

(iii) remove such goods or merchandise; or

(iv) prevent or stop the construction of such building; or

(v) remove, repair, or support it; or

(vi) alter the disposal of such substance; or

(vii) remove such tree; or

(viii) fence such tank, well, or excavation as the case may be.

Page 27 of 32

The provisions of section 98 are clear that, whatever the conditional order a

Magistrate decides to make should be definitive and should be a one one that

could be carried out, and there should be a time limit to carry out the order as

well. I am unable to find any of the above in the said order.

After the order was served on the mentioned 2nd party named before the

Magistrates Court, the Chief Engineer of the Provincial Road Development

Authority has appeared before the Court, and a clarification has been sought as

to the conditional order.

It appears that, submissions have been made before the learned Additional

Magistrate to the effect that as a solution to flooding which occurs in Borella to

Kottawa road situated adjacent to the land belonging to the 1st respondent of the

2nd party, the said respondent has given a part of the land belonging to her to

the Provincial Road Development Authority for the authority to construct a

drainage system to bring down the water from the said road up to the railway

culvert situated towards the Northern boundary of her land, and accordingly,

the Provincial Road Development Authority of the Western Province has

constructed a drainage system far back as the year 2004. This is the drainage

system the 1st party respondents named in the Magistrates Court case had

wanted the learned Additional Magistrate to close down.

The Provincial Road Development Authority has also submitted a proposal where

it has been indicated to the Court that if an underground drainage system can

be built along the road used by the 1st party, the issue of rainwater running

through the roadway could be resolved.

However, it appears that the learned Additional Magistrate has made another

order on 15-02-2023 on the basis that she is clarifying the order made on 16-

12-2022, which reads as follows.

.

.

Page 28 of 32

.

.

I am of the view that none of the conditional orders made by the learned

Additional Magistrate are orders made with clarity which can be implemented. It

is imperative on a Magistrate when making conditional orders to identify the

place or the structure or the issue where the nuisance should be prevented.

When making such an order, a Magistrate needs to consider all the relevant

factors and consider where the balance of convenience lie. There should be a

time limit fixed by such an order as well.

I am unable to find any of the basic matters that should be stated in an order of

this nature has been mentioned by the learned Additional Magistrate, so that

the conditional order can be carried out.

After making the above two orders, it appears that the learned Additional

Magistrate has carried out an inspection of the place where the alleged nuisance

is taking place. There had been a public disturbance at the inspection as several

persons have come forward claiming that if the drainage system is closed, they

will be affected as a result.

Several other parties have intervened to the case after the inspection. The

petitioner has also intervened in the matter as the party responsible for the

construction of the drainage system and maintenance of the roads within the

Western Provincial Council area.

After having considered the submissions made by the intervening parties, the

learned Additional Magistrate, on 02-08-2023, has made the following order.

.

.

Page 29 of 32

.

. , 100(2)

, "

185

" .

.

.

.

101 .

Although the learned Additional Magistrate has not specifically stated so, it is

clear that the learned Additional Magistrate has decided that if the earlier

conditional order made was to be carried out, it will cause more prejudice to

some other parties. In all practical terms, the effect of the above order had been

the suspension of the earlier mentioned conditional order and to hold an inquiry

in terms of section 101 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

It is against the said order made on 02-08-2023, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th

and 11th parties of the 1st party respondents (hereinafter referred to as the

respondents) named in the Magistrates Court action have filed the revision

application number HC/RA/113/23 before the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Colombo.

In their petition, they have sought a stay order against the earlier mentioned

order of the Magistrate and for an order that the original conditional orders made

on 16-12-2022 and 15-02-2023 be made effective.

the Western Province Holden in Colombo, the learned High Court Judge has

pronounced the impugned order.

At the hearing of this application, the main contention of the learned Counsel

who represented the respondents was on the premise that there was nothing

wrong in the conditional order pronounced by the learned Additional Magistrate,

and if the petitioner wanted to challenge the said order, the only way the

petitioner could challenge would be under and in terms of section 98(2) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

He was of the view that the petitioner has failed to do so, and has failed to abide

by the conditional order causing great inconveniences to the respondents.

Making extensive submissions as to the public nuisance caused by the alleged

actions of the petitioner, the learned Counsel submitted that the revision

application should be dismissed for want of merit.

He also submitted that the originally named 2nd party 3rd respondent before the

Magistrates Court, namely the Engineer of the Provincial Road Development

Authority, has also filed an application in revision challenging the clarification

made by the learned Additional Magistrate on 15-02-2023 in relation to the

conditional order made by the learned Additional Magistrate on 16-12-2022,

under Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo Case

No. HC/RA/37/2023.

The said application has been dismissed by the order dated 22-03-2024 by the

learned Provincial High Court Judge of the Western Province Holden in Colombo.

As I have stated before, it is clear from the material placed before this Court that

the learned High Court Judge has decided to issue notice and hear the

application filed in revision by the respondents. The learned High Court Judge,

while giving a direction that the order dated 16-12-2022 should be given effect

until the conclusion of the application before the High Court, has also given

permission for the learned Additional Magistrate to hold the inquiry as decided

Page 31 of 32

by her order dated 02-08-2023 and has also allowed the parties to pursue any

possible settlements.

I am of the view that the part of the said order where the learned High Court

Judge says that the conditional order dated 16-12-2022 should be given effect

was an order made without having due consideration as to the fact whether it

was an order that can be carried out.

As I have already stated, this was an order that cannot be carried out as it was

not a clear order in that regard. The very reason why the learned Additional

Magistrate decided not to implement the order and to hold an inquiry instead,

shows that the original order was an order that cannot be implemented.

I am in no position to agree with the contention of the learned Counsel for the

respondents that the petitioner has failed to come before the Magistrates Court

in terms of section 98(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and make an

application in terms of the said section.

It is clear that the police have failed to name the correct party that should be

brought before the Court, who should be actually held responsible for the

construction of a drainage system which causes the alleged nuisance. The

petitioner on its own motion has intervened into the matter and had even

suggested the possible solution to the issue.

That means that in fact, the petitioner has come before the Magistrates Court in

terms of section 98(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and has made the

relevant application in terms of the section, despite the fact there had been no

time frame given in the conditional order.

I am of the view that the learned High Court Judges interim order where it has

been directed that the conditional order made by the learned Additional

Magistrate should be given effect until the final conclusion of the revision

application filed before the High Court cannot be justified for the reasons as

considered above.

Therefore, allowing the revision application, I set aside the interim order

pronounced by the learned High Court Judge on 25-09-2023 up to the extent of

setting aside the order where it says that the order dated 16-12-2022 of the

learned Additional Magistrate of Nugegoda should be carried out.

The remainder of the order, where it says that the Magistrate should proceed

with the inquiry, and the parties are entitled to consider entering into a

settlement shall remain intact.

Subject to the above variation to the order dated 21-09-2023 and 25-09-2023,

the learned High Court Judge is directed to proceed with the revision application

as already decided, and pronounce a judgment in that regard, expeditiously as

possible.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden in Colombo, and also to

the Magistrates Court of Nugegoda for necessary compliance.
