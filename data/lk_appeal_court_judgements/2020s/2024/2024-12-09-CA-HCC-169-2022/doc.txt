Introduction

1. When this matter was initially called in the High Court of

Kurunegala my sister Justice Menaka Wijesundera (as she then

was) happened to be the presiding High Court Judge but was

then heard and determined by her successor. However, when this

appeal was taken up for argument Mr. Rikaz Riffard AAL., was

appraised of the same. Mr. Riffard then informed that as those

were mere mention dates prior to the trial the appellant has no

objection to Justice Wijesundera being a member of this bench

considering this appeal. Accordingly, this was taken up for

argument on 11.11.2024.

2. The accused-appellant was indicted with three counts of grave

sexual abuse committed on a girl less than 16 years of age and

was convicted of count No. 01 and acquitted of counts 02 and 03

by Judgment dated 25.05.2022. Thereafter, the learned High

Court Judge imposed a sentence of ten years rigorous

imprisonment and also a fine of Rs. 15,000.00 with a default

sentence of three months simple imprisonment. Further, the

Page 3 of 11

payment of Rs. 100,000.00 compensation to the aggrieved party

was also ordered with a default sentence of six months simple

imprisonment. The accused-appellant being aggrieved by the said

conviction and the sentence did prefer this appeal. However,

when the matter was taken up for argument on 11.11.2024. Mr.

Rikaz Riffard, AAL., for the appellant informed that the appellant

intends only to pursue with the appeal against the sentence and

accordingly abandoned and withdrew the appeal against the

conviction.

3. In respect of the sentence, the Counsel submitted that the

learned Trial Judge has imposed a sentence of ten years which is

above the minimum mandatory sentence and submitted the that

the following mitigatory circumstances be considered and a

variation of the sentence be made in favour of the appellant. The

said grounds are;

i. The incident has taken place almost ten years prior

to date of sentencing.

ii. The defence has admitted the Medico Legal Report.

iii. The accused is a father of two children and is the sole

breadwinner.

4. In addition to the above, attention was also drawn to the plea in

mitigation made on behalf of the appellant on 01.06.2022. They

are;

i. Absence of any previous convictions.

ii. Being in remand for over one year prior to the

conviction.

5. Mr. Hiranjan Pieris S/DSG in his usual magnanimous form did

inform that he would not seriously object to this application and

submitted that he would leave the matter entirely to court.

Facts

6. The victim is a girl who was around seven years of age when this

incident took place between 2011 and 2012. The accused-

appellant is a person living close to their house in the village

maybe about half a kilometer away. On that particular day, she

had accompanied her mother who has gone for employment

where her mother works on and off, along with others making

bricks in a land adjacent to the accuseds house. When all were

at work, the accused has surreptitiously called the victim into his

house, taken her to a room and has placed his penis on her

female organ and pressed. After a short while having heard her

mother call, she had come out of the house. She had not divulged

this to her mother. At a later point of time, she had told this to

her grandmother. Then her mother having been informed had

taken her to the police and this complaint was thus made. The

victim also narrates that she had been so abused on a few other

occasions by this accused. These are the basic facts of the

offending.

7. After trial, the accused was convicted of count No. 01, that of

grave sexual abuse of the victim punishable under Section

365B(2)(b) of the Penal Code. Now this appeal is limited to the

sentence only. The appellant moves for a variation and a

mitigation of the sentence in his favour.

The Law

8. At the outset, it is prudent to consider the sentence prescribed

by law for this offence. It is a term of not less than seven years

and not exceeding twenty years with a fine and also

compensation. Therefore, a minimum mandatory sentence is

prescribed by law. However, the Supreme Court in SC

Reference/3/2008 has decided that a Trial Judges discretion to

Page 5 of 11

determine the sentence is not circumscribed by the minimum

mandatory sentence prescribed by law. Thus, it is now settled law

that a Trial Judge has a discretion to decide on an appropriate

sentence notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence

prescribed by law (vide SC/3/2008). The Supreme Court opined

unanimously that, the minimum mandatory sentence in Section

362 (2) (e) is in conflict with Article 4 (c), 11 and 12(1) of the

Constitution and that the High Court is not inhibited from imposing

a sentence that it deems appropriate in the exercise of its judicial

discretion notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence.

9. However, one must be mindful that penal statutes do provide for

minimum mandatory sentences even as at today. Thus, a

category of offences which provide for a minimum mandatory

sentence is active in our statutes. No doubt, in view of the

Supreme Court decision in 3/2008, the discretion of a sentencing

judge is not inhibited by such limitation. This does not mean and

cannot or be construed to say that where a minimum mandatory

is prescribed in a penal provision now it has no meaning or

relevance. Subject to the judicial discretion there exists a

category of offences in which a minimum mandatory sentence is

prescribed. This is buttressed by the fact that, long after the

Supreme Court decision in 3/2008 the Legislator has recently in

the amending Act No. 25 of 2024 referred to statutes where a

minimum mandatory sentence is stipulated in the proviso to

section 283A (1) of the Criminal Procedure Act.

10. Hence to my mind, when the legislature has prescribed a

minimum mandatory sentence, it certainly is a manifestation and

an indication that the said offence is considered to be serious and

warrants a deterrent sentence. Parliament determines and set the

parameters for such condign and appropriate punishment and in

that process determines a minimum sentence of imprisonment

Page 6 of 11

for certain offences to provide a deterrent impact. This is a clear

insistence that manifests Legislature's resolve to meet such

offences with a very strong sanction as means of deterrence. That

is the policy of law. The courts are obliged to respect this

legislative mandate.

11. Certainly, in view of SC Reference 3/2008 though a trial Judge is

neither shackled nor inhibited by the said minimum mandatory

sentence, is required to have regard to the fact that a minimum

mandatory sentence is so fixed. A court now certainly has the

discretion to impose a sentence of imprisonment less than the

prescribed minimum. However, I am of the view that the judge

should have and there should be some adequate reason/s to go

below the said minimum sentence. The court should mention

such reasons in the judgement when awarding a sentence less

than the prescribed minimum. In order to exercise the discretion

to impose a sentence less than the minimum prescribed there

should be and the court has to record such reason/s which is

adequate. This to my mind should necessarily be some tangible

and good reason which is not fanciful. Thus, to my mind it is

necessary and prudent to assign and give the reason if and when

a Judge decides to impose a sentence below the minimum

mandatory fixed by law.

12. At this juncture it is relevant to note that there were a series of

decisions by the Supreme Court following the principle as laid

down in 3/2008, acting in appeal did reduce the sentence well

below the minimum mandatory. They are Rohana alias Loku vs.

Attorney General (2011) 2 SLR 174 and Ambagala

Mudiyanselage Samantha Sampath vs. Attorney General

SC/Appeal/17/2013.

In the case of Rohana alias Loku vs. Attorney General (2011) 2

SLR 174, the Supreme Court imposed a sentence below the

Page 7 of 11

mandatory minimum due to several mitigating circumstances.

They are that the prosecutrix was aged 15; was in a consensual

romantic relationship with the accused; she had urged him to

take her away from her home, where she faced harassment from

her family; and she threatened to commit suicide if he refused.

Acting out of emotional impulse rather than coercion, the

accused took her to his uncles and sisters homes, where they

stayed for four days and engaged in consensual sexual

intercourse.

The court also noted that the accused had not used force or

malicious intent and that the prosecutrix was a reluctant witness

against the accused. Accordingly, although the accused was

considered technically guilty of the offence described in Section

364(2)(e) of the Penal Code, set aside the sentence of the High

Court and the reduced five-year sentence of the Court of Appeal,

substituting a sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment

suspended for a period of ten years.

Then in Ambagala Mudiyanselage Samantha Sampath vs.

Attorney General [(SC/Appeal/17/2013) decided on

12.03.2015], the accused, who was married to the victims sister,

was invited to live with the victims family after his wife left him,

the victim became pregnant, and the accused acknowledged

paternity, actively supporting and caring for the child, including

financial maintenance and involvement in her education. The

Supreme Court prioritized the best interests of the child,

emphasizing that sentencing the accused to 10 years

imprisonment would deprive the child of paternal care during her

formative years. Additionally, the family had initially chosen to

resolve the matter privately without involving law enforcement.

Following the Supreme Courts determination in 03/2008, the

Court held that mandatory minimum sentences should not

Page 8 of 11

override judicial discretion, particularly when constitutional

rights and individual circumstances are at stake. Consequently,

the court upheld the suspended sentence imposed by the High

Court to balance justice and the childs welfare.

13. In these two decisions the respective Court did advert to such

reasons that warrants going below the minimum mandatory

sentence. Thus, as held above if and when a Judge decides to

impose a sentence below the minimum mandatory fixed by law it

is necessarily have and to expressly state and give the reason.

Consideration of the Sentence

14. Now to consider the Appellants sentence, the Trial Judge upon

considering the impact and the trauma suffered by the victim has

imposed a deterrent sentence of ten years imprisonment. This is

above the minimum mandatory of seven years. When the

minimum mandatory is prescribed, no doubt, a Judge now has

discretion to determine the appropriate sentence considering the

circumstances of the offending and the gravity of the offence. In

this instance, the victim was a girl of seven years and the accused

is a known adult well above the age of the child. In the normal

course of event, one would expect such an elder in a village to

protect minor children. Thus, the appellant has clearly, by

committing this act, breached the trust and confidence reposed

in him which is a serious breach of trust so to say. Further, the

appellant has very cunningly and artfully taken advantage of the

innocence of this girl and committed this act of sexual abuse

which is abhorrent by any civilized standard. Until the taking up

of this appeal, the appellant has not demonstrated any remorse

or repentance. There is almost no reason or mitigatory

circumstance that is evident from the proceeding or the

submission to consider in favour of the appellant, as such, there

is no reasonable ground or basis to consider a sentence below the

Page 9 of 11

minimum mandatory prescribed by law. As for the long-drawn-

out trial I find that the appellant, himself is responsible to a great

extent to this delay. Therefore, it is unfortunate that the delay

also cannot be considered in his favour.

15. In sentencing and determining the appropriate punishment, a

Court is required to consider the same from the point of view of

the appellant as well as the public. In Attorney General V. H.N.

De Silva 57 NLR 121 Basnayake A.C.J. clearly and concisely has

explained the matters that should be considered in determining

the sentence as follows;

In assessing the punishment that should be passed on an

offender, a judge should consider the matter of sentence

both from the point of view of the public and the offender.

Judges are too often prone to look at the question only from

the angle of the offender. A Judge should, in determining the

proper sentence first consider the gravity of the offence as it

appears from the nature of the act itself and should have

regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other

statute under which the offender is charged. He should also

regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent and

consider to what extent it will be effective. If the offender

held a position of trust or belonged to a service which enjoys

the public confidence that must be taken into account in

assessing the punishment. The incidents of crimes of the

nature of which the offender has been found to be guilty and

the difficulty of the detection are also matters which should

receive due consideration. The reformation are also matters

which should receive due consideration. The reformation of

the criminal, though no doubt an important consideration is

subordinate to the others I have mentioned. Where the public

interest or the welfare of the state (which is synonymous)

Page 10 of 11

outweighs the previous good character, antecedents and age

of the offender, public interest must prevail.

16. In recent years, by the numerous cases in this court we have seen

that crimes against women and children are on the rise. These

crimes are violations of the person of the victims and an affront to

the human dignity of any civilized society. Imposition of

inadequate sentences is not only an injustice to the victim of the

crime in particular and the society as a whole in general, but also

at times encourages a criminal to act with impunity. The Courts

have an obligation while awarding punishment to impose

appropriate punishment particularly keeping with the intent and

the mandate of the Legislature. Further the public abhorrence of

the crime should be reflected through the punishment. The Courts

must not only consider the rights of the criminal but also the

rights of the victim of crime and the society at large whilst

determining the appropriate sentence.

17. That being so, in this appeal I find no tangible or appreciable

reason which justifies or enables the court to consider a sentence

below the minimum mandatory. However, the fact that the

appellant opted to abandon and withdraw the appeal against the

conviction to some extent manifests at least a belated sense of

remorse or an acknowledgment of his wrongdoing.

18. Then the Medico Legal Report has been admitted by the defence

during the trial. Section 420 of the Criminal Procedure Act

provides that, the court shall, when passing sentence on the

accused person have regard to the fact that he has made an

admission under this section. This is a matter that may be

considered in favour of the appellant when passing the sentence,

which I am inclined to. This considered along with the fact that

the accused had not acted in any cruel manner or resorted to

Page 11 of 11

violence in committing this offence, do give rise to some reason

which may be lawfully considered in favour of the appellant in

mitigation.

Conclusion

19. Accordingly, I am inclined to vary and reduce the sentence from

ten years to seven years rigorous imprisonment. Subject to this

variation, the fine and compensation along with the default terms

as imposed by the Trial Judge are all affirmed.

20. Further, I direct that the sentence to be operative with effect from

01.06.2022, the date of sentencing. Subject to the above variation

in the sentence, the appeal against the conviction is dismissed and

the appeal against the sentence is partially allowed.
