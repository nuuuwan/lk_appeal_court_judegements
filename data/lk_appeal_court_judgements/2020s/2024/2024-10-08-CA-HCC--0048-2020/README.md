JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for the

Trafficking and Possession of 11.54 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on

18th April 2013.

Following the trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the

learned High Court Judge of Colomb imposed the death sentence for both

counts on 05/03/2020.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

CA/HCC/48/20

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the hearing,

the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. The learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration

material contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses.

2. The learned High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration that

the version of the prosecution fails the test of probability.

3. The learned High Court Judge had arrived at the wrong conclusion that

the prosecution had proved the chain of productions.

4. The learned High Court Judge had erroneously rejected the dock

statement and the learned High Court Judge had expected the

Appellant to prove his case by calling witnesses and thereby shifted

the burden on the Appellant to prove his innocence.

In this case, the raid was conducted based on specific information received.

The raid was headed by PW1 with six male and one female police officer from

the Police Narcotics Bureau. Each of them including the Government Analyst

has been named as witnesses in the indictment. The prosecution had called

PW1, PW7, PW8, and PW10 and marked productions P1 to P14 in support

of their case. The Government Analysts qualifications were admitted under

Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had made a dock statement and

closed the defence case.

As the Appellant absconded after making his statement from the dock,

evidence was led under Section 241(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No.15 of 1979 to conclude the matter in absentia of the Appellant. As such,

CA/HCC/48/20

4 | P a g e

only the prosecution had made closing submissions in this case. But the

Appellant was very well represented until the conclusion of the case. The

Judgment was delivered on 05.03.2020 and he was arrested and produced

on 20.07.2020.

Background of the case.

On 18/04/2013 PW1 SI/Delgahapitiya attached to the Police Narcotics

Bureau Colombo had conducted a raid acting based on information received

from PW7 PC 74811 Rathugamage. PW7 had received an information from

his personal informer that the Appellant was selling Heroin at a place called

Cardernanawatta, in the Borella Police area. After meeting the informer close

to the place of arrest, PW1 and PW7 had arrested the Appellant close to his

house. Upon searching him, a cellophane bag with some substance was

recovered from his right-side trouser pocket. Upon the substances in the

parcel recovered from the Appellant reacting for Heroin (diacetylmorphine),

he was arrested at 11.30 hours and subjected to further investigation. As the

investigation revealed that his house was situated in Serpentine Road,

Borella, the police party had gone to the Appellants house and firstly PW7

had searched the Appellant and found Rs.317,000/- from his left side

trouser pocket. Although the house was searched, they were not successful

in recovering any illegal substances. But the police team had been able to

recover Rs.297,000/- and some jewelleries from an almirah used by the

Appellants wife. As such, the Appellants wife Mangalika Samanthi too were

arrested along with the recovery. Thereafter, the police party had returned

to the Police Narcotics Bureau at 13:30 hours, sealed the production, entered

the same in the production register and handed over the Appellant to the

reserve duty officer at that time. But the sealed Heroin parcel was handed

over to PW8 on the following day, as he was not available in the Bureau.

Until such time, the sealed production was in the custody of PW1.

CA/HCC/48/20

Thereafter, PW7 was called to give evidence to corroborate the evidence of

PW1 and it was followed by the evidence of the Government Analyst and

PW8.

Although the wife of the Appellant was arrested along with Rs.297,000/- and

gold jewelleries, she was released along with the cash and the jewelleries.

In this case, although a preliminary objection was raised with regard to the

appeal being out of time by the learned Deputy Solicitor General, it was not

persuaded due to the Gazette Notification No. 2175/2 dated 12.05.2020

which had extended the appealable time period due to the Covid pandemic.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus:

[1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

CA/HCC/48/20

6 | P a g e

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required

in a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree

is well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree

of probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof

beyond the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the

community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of

justice. If the evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a

remote possibility in his favour which can be dismissed with the

sentence, of course it is possible, but not in the least probable, the case

is proved beyond reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will

suffice.

As the 1st and 2nd appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are interrelated,

the said grounds will be considered together in this case.

The role of probability is pivotal in persuading the judge on specific points,

as higher probabilities increase the likelihood of the judge being convinced.

Probability plays a crucial role in criminal investigations, aiding in the

evaluation of the relevance of different types of evidence. In order to accuse

someone "beyond reasonable doubt," it is essential to possess substantial

evidence. To achieve this, certain assumptions must be made to draw

conclusions. The likelihood of these assumptions being accurate is precisely

termed the principle of probability in legal contexts.

In this case, police officers had conducted the raid upon the information

received by PW7. According to the informant a person has been selling Heroin

close to a house with an assessment No. 145/25. PW1 admitted that even

though he had said that the information revealed a person called Wasantha

selling Heroin, in his notes he had not entered the name Wasantha.

It must be mentioned here that the utilization of informants in Sri Lankan

criminal cases are quite common. Law enforcement officers often use

informants to try to fabricate cases against someone they believe is guilty of

a crime. Hence, quite understandably, the Judiciary faces quite an arduous

task when it comes to verifying the reliability of an information.

PW7, who received the information, had not put any notes of meeting the

informant, establishing the identity of the Appellant and the place where they

had met the informant etc. PW7 admitted that he only entered the notes as

follows:

Both PW1 and PW7 had stated that they had met the informant at

Cardernana Watta and all walked in very close proximity to the Appellant

before the informant left the place. The learned Counsel strenuously argued

that this raises serious probability issues as usually the informant never

appears in public to indicate the culprits to the police officers. In this case

as per PW1 and PW7, the informant had walked with them until they were

very close to the place where the Appellant was standing. Considering the

above cited portion of the brief, a doubt had been created as to whether PW1

and PW7 actually met the informant at Cadernana Watta prior to the arrest

of the Appellant.

According to PW1, the Appellant was arrested in front his house. But

contradicting PW1, PW7 had stated that he was arrested at the entrance of

the Cadernana Watta. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

According to the prosecution, the Appellant had possessed 249 currency

notes amounting to Rs.317,000/-in his trouser pocket. When PW1 and PW7

had checked him, they had only found the Heroin parcel from his right-side

trouser pocket. But they had not detected anything in the possession of the

Appellant until they checked him when they were inside his house. The

relevant portion is re-produced below:

The contention of the defence is that the Appellant was not arrested as stated

by PW1 and PW7, but was arrested at his house and that all the money was

recovered from his house. This had been properly suggested to PW1 by the

defence. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

The explanation given by the Appellant is that he had raised the money after

selling a vehicle to repair his house. It is very pertinent to note that PW1 and

PW7 had also recovered some gold jewelleries and Rs.297,000/- from the

Appellants wifes almirah and arrested the wife of the Appellant as well.

Although she was arrested, she was discharged from the case and the money

Rs.297,000/- and her jewelleries were returned after accepting her

explanation. The prosecution had not elicited any explanation as to on what

basis they had released the money and jewelleries to the wife of the Appellant

when she was released from this case.

Judges formulate their judgments based on the information presented to

them during court proceedings, including verbal arguments, written

submissions, and supporting documents provided by the parties through

their legal representatives. They meticulously examine the facts presented

and evaluate the evidence that has been entered into the court record.

Ultimately, their decisions are based on an objective analysis of the law and

the evidence presented, rather than subjective personal beliefs. Relying on

personal beliefs would introduce significant bias into the judicial process,

CA/HCC/48/20

10 | P a g e

undermining the fairness and impartiality that are fundamental principles

of the legal system.

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the

prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlewis JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim

the benefit of any omission or mistake made by the other side,

and a Judge's position in a criminal trial is not merely that of an

umpire to see that the rules of the game are applied by both sides.

A Judge is an administrator of justice, not merely a figure-head,

he has not only to direct and control the proceedings according to

recognised rules of procedure but to see that justice is done.

The burden of proof is usually on the person who brings a claim in a dispute.

It is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas probandi

incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: "The necessity of proof always

lies with the person who lays charges."

It is commonly acknowledged that shifting a legal onus onto the accused

with respect to an element of an offence that is essential to culpability is an

encroachment on the presumption of innocence, and more difficult to

justify. Shifting the burden of proof on such an issue involves the possibility

of unfair conviction.

The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has argued before the

Supreme Court that a law that reverses the burden of proof on to an accused

person, thereby putting a legal burden on them to disprove an element of an

offence, interferes with their right to a fair trial as protected by the

Constitution.

CA/HCC/48/20

11 | P a g e

Sinad Gibney, Chief Commissioner of the Irish Human Rights and Equality

Commission stated:

Given its importance to the integrity of the justice system, a reversal of

the burden of proof, particularly in a criminal case where the accused

persons right to liberty is at stake, must always be subject to the

highest tests and exist within the parameters set by the Constitution.

Article 13(3) of our Constitution enshrines the concept fair trial. The Article

states:

Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard, in

person or by an Attorney-at-Law, at a fair trial by a competent court.

To determine whether you are innocent or guilty, the concept of fair trial

plays a vital role. A fair trial is a universally recognised human right. Fair

trials help to establish the truth and are vital for everyone involved in a case.

It is a cornerstone of democracy, helping to ensure fair and just societies.

In this case the learned High Court Judge in his judgment at page 293 of the

brief stated as follows:

Page 293 of the brief.

ke;'

This portion of the judgment clearly demonstrate that the Appellant had not

been afforded a fair trial.

In this case the raid was conducted on an information received. Further, the

raid conducted and the recovery of productions have failed to pass the test

of probability in this case. If the learned Trial Judge had examined the

CA/HCC/48/20

12 | P a g e

evidence presented from the correct perspective, he would have been inclined

to accept the testimony provided by the Appellant.

Further, the Appellant was not afforded a fair trial as guaranteed in the

Constitution.

Guided by the above cited judicial decisions, I conclude that the 1st, 2nd and

4th grounds advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on the

prosecution case. As such, the 3rd ground of appeal is not considered in this

appeal.

As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 05/03/2020 on the Appellant. Therefore, he

is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
