RESPONDENTS Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. Counsel: Chamara Nanayakkarawasam, instructed by Sunil Watagala for the Petitioner. Ms. Shemanthi Dunuwella, SC for the Respondents. Argued on : 05.06.2024 Written Submissions on : 12.07.2024 (by Petitioner) Decided on : 04.09.2024 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner through his amended Petition seeks orders in the nature of

writs of Certiorari to quash the Charge Sheet marked P26 and the decisions

contained in P16 and P17 to suspend the Petitioner's services. Furthermore,

the Petitioner also seeks an order in the nature of writs of Mandamus directing

Page 3 of 9

the 1st to 4th Respondents, or any one or more of them, to reinstate the

Petitioner in service and to pay the Petitioner back wages and other

emoluments that the Petitioner would have otherwise been entitled to if P16,

P17, and P26 had not been issued against the Petitioner.

This case arises from the actions taken by the Respondents against the

Petitioner during his employment. The Petitioner, a Certified Public

Accountant and Internal Auditor with extensive qualifications and experience,

was employed as the Project Internal Auditor for the Badulla Chenkaladi Road

Improvement Project, a project under the Ministry of Transport and Highways

(marked 'P1(a) to P1(d)').

The Project, funded by the Saudi Fund for Development and the OPEC Fund,

consists of two components: improvement of roads from Bibila to Chenkaladi

(Component A) and from Badulla to Bibila (Component B) (marked 'P5'). The

estimated cost for each component is submitted to be USD 60 million. The

project commenced in January 2017 and is scheduled to continue until

December 2025, barring any further extensions (marked 'P5').

The Petitioner was appointed to the role of Project Internal Auditor in 2018

after responding to an advertisement published by the Ministry (marked 'P3').

His initial contract was for one year but was extended multiple times based

on his performance and the needs of the project, with his term extended until

a replacement could be found (marked 'P4', 'P5', 'P6', 'P7', 'P8', 'P9').

On 13th January 2023, the Petitioner notified the 2nd Respondent, the Project

Director, of his intention to contest the Local Authorities Election of 2023 as

a candidate from the National Peoples Power (NPP) party (marked 'P13').

Subsequently, the Petitioner submitted his nominations on 19th January

2023. Initially scheduled for 9th March 2023, the election was postponed

indefinitely due to financial constraints (marked 'P12').

Page 4 of 9

On 13th March 2023, the Petitioner re-submitted his intention to contest the

election following a request from the 2nd Respondent (marked 'P14'). However,

the 2nd Respondent sought instructions from the Additional Secretary

(Administration) of the Ministry regarding the Petitioners candidacy (marked

'P15'). On 20th March 2023, the 2nd Respondent issued a letter suspending

the Petitioner's services, citing instructions from the 3rd Respondent, pending

guidance from the Election Commission (marked 'P16', 'P17').

The Petitioner appealed the suspension, asserting that he had not violated

any laws or procedures by contesting the election (marked 'P18'). He further

inquired whether the Respondents had sought instructions from the Election

Commission, but it was revealed that no such instructions had been

requested (marked 'P20'). Despite the Petitioner's continued appeals and his

dire economic and health circumstances, including undergoing heart surgery,

the Respondents failed to reinstate him or provide any resolution (marked

'P22', 'P32').

On 12th July 2023, the 1st Respondent issued a charge sheet against the

Petitioner, alleging that as a Staff Grade Officer in the public service, he was

required to resign before submitting his nominations for the election (marked

'P26'). The Petitioner contested this charge, arguing that he was not a public

officer as defined by the Constitution or the Establishments Code, and that

his role as an auditor in a project was distinct from a typical public service

position (marked 'P27'). Furthermore, he contended that he had informed his

Appointing Authority of his intention to contest the election, and no objections

were raised at the time (marked 'P13', 'P14').

The Petitioner submits that his suspension and the issuance of the charge

sheet have severely impacted his career and financial stability. He now seeks

judicial intervention for the quashing of the suspension and charge sheet,

reinstatement in his position, and compensation for the back wages lost due

to the Respondents' actions, which he alleges were arbitrary, unreasonable,

and politically motivated.

The Respondents argue that the Petitioner delayed filing his application by

five months after his suspension, demonstrating laches, and that he misled

the Court by claiming he is not bound by the Establishments Code, despite

his appointment letter stating otherwise (Clause 4 of document marked 'P4',

'P16'). They acknowledge the Petitioners role as Project Internal Auditor but

maintain that his employment is governed by the Management Services

Circulars and the Establishments Code. As a Senior Staff Officer under

category PS4, the Petitioner was required to comply with these regulations,

including rules on political candidacy (marked 'P11', 'R11').

The Respondents argue that the Petitioners notification of his intent to

contest the Local Authorities Election was mishandled, as his initial letter

referred to a Provincial Council Election that was not due, leading to

confusion. They claim he did not properly notify them of his actual candidacy

until March 2023, after submitting his nominations (marked 'P13', 'P14', 'R9').

The Respondents justify the Petitioners suspension on the basis that it was

necessary to ensure compliance with the law while they sought further

instructions. They contend that this was a procedural step taken while

investigating whether the Petitioners actions breached statutory or regulatory

requirements (marked 'P16', 'P17', 'R10').

They assert that the Petitioner, as a Senior Staff Officer bound by the

Establishments Code, was required to resign before submitting his

nominations for the election. The charge sheet issued against him was based

on his failure to comply with this requirement, which the Respondents argue

was a clear violation of the relevant provisions of the Establishments Code

(marked 'P26', 'R6(a)', 'R6(b)').

The Respondents deny any allegations of unlawful or arbitrary conduct,

stating that all actions taken were in accordance with legal and administrative

standards. They emphasize that the Petitioner was given a fair hearing and

Page 6 of 9

that their actions were justified, including the suspension and the issuance

of the charge sheet (marked 'R14', 'R15', 'R16').

The Respondents also argue that the Project is nearing completion, rendering

the Petitioners request for relief, including reinstatement, futile.

In the aforesaid context, Petitioner contends that the actions taken by the

Respondentsspecifically his suspension and the issuance of a charge

sheetwere unlawful, arbitrary, and without any legal foundation. The

Petitioner asserts that his role as Project Internal Auditor was governed by

specific contractual terms distinct from those applicable to public officers in

the general civil service. The relief sought through the issuance of Writs of

Certiorari and Mandamus is grounded on the premise that the Respondents

have acted in violation of established legal principles and administrative

fairness, thus warranting judicial intervention in favour of the Petitioner.

Central to the Petitioners argument is the nature of his employment and the

applicability of the Establishments Code. The Petitioner maintains that his

appointment was governed by the Management Services Circular No.

01/2019, which specifically addresses the terms and conditions of project

staff, including salary scales, contractual obligations, and disciplinary

procedures (marked 'P11'). He asserts that the Establishments Code, which

primarily regulates public officers, does not apply to his role as a project

employee. The Respondents position that the Petitioner was bound by the

Establishments Code, particularly the requirement to resign prior to

contesting an election, is therefore legally untenable. The Petitioner argues

that his role was explicitly defined under the terms of his contractual

engagement, and thus outside the conventional public service structure,

thereby exempting him from the provisions cited by the Respondents (marked

'P11', 'P27').

The Petitioner further contends that he had adequately notified the relevant

authorities of his intention to contest the Local Authorities Election in

Page 7 of 9

January 2023. This notification was made in writing to the 2nd Respondent,

who, at the time, raised no objections and verbally indicated that there were

no legal impediments to the Petitioners candidacy (marked 'P13'). The

Respondents, however, allege that the Petitioner failed to properly notify them

and instead misled them by referring to an incorrect type of election. The

Petitioner disputes this, emphasizing that his good faith efforts to

communicate his candidacy were met with acceptance, and no objections or

formal guidance were provided by the Respondents at the time. The

subsequent disciplinary actions taken against him, including his suspension,

were thus not only procedurally flawed but also in direct contradiction to the

Respondents initial tacit approval of his election candidacy.

The Petitioners suspension of services without pay on 20th March 2023, is a

critical issue. The Petitioner argues that this suspension was executed

without due process and without any legal justification, infringing upon his

right to a fair and unbiased administrative procedure. The Petitioner asserts

that the suspension was ordered on vague grounds, pending guidance from

the Election Commissiona step that was never conclusively pursued by the

Respondents. This, highlights the Respondents arbitrary exercise of

disciplinary powers, which were used as a punitive measure without

substantiated cause. Furthermore, the suspension deprived the Petitioner of

his livelihood and professional standing without any conclusive findings of

misconduct, thereby violating basic principles of natural justice.

The issuance of the charge sheet on 12th July 2023, which accused the

Petitioner of failing to resign from his post before submitting his election

nominations, is further evidence of the Respondents flawed approach

(marked 'P26'). The Petitioner argues that this charge was premised on a

fundamental misinterpretation of his employment status and the applicable

legal framework. He points out that as a project employee, he does not fall

within the definition of a public officer under the Establishments Code or the

Constitution, and therefore, the provisions cited in the charge sheet do not

apply to him. The Petitioner contends that the Respondents decision to issue

Page 8 of 9

the charge was not only legally incorrect but also a gross overreach, as it

sought to impose public service standards on a distinct contractual

engagement. The Respondents failure to recognize this distinction has

resulted in a charge that is both procedurally and substantively flawed,

rendering it void ab initio.

In addressing the Respondents arguments, the Petitioner emphasizes that

the Management Services Circular clearly delineates the boundaries of project

staff employment and does not equate such roles with public officers subject

to the Establishments Code (marked 'P11'). The Petitioners legitimate

expectation of continued employment until the completion of the project in

December 2025 was repeatedly affirmed through extensions of his contract,

which recognized his valuable contributions without any noted deficiencies or

objections regarding his professional conduct (marked 'P7', 'P8'). The

Respondents abrupt and punitive actions, taken without due cause, violated

the Petitioners right to a stable and predictable work environment, further

justifying his claim for reinstatement and compensation for lost wages.

The Respondents position that the Petitioners suspension was necessary

pending further investigation is, according to the Petitioner, an after-the-fact

justification that fails to address the procedural lapses that occurred at the

time of suspension. The lack of immediate and clear communication with the

Election Commission, coupled with the absence of any urgent or compelling

evidence of misconduct, underscores the arbitrary nature of the Respondents

actions. The Petitioner argues that the Respondents have misused their

disciplinary powers, applying them in a manner that is both disproportionate

and without proper procedural safeguards.

The Petitioners submission that he is not bound by the Establishments Code

is further reinforced by the distinction between his contractual role and that

of a public officer. The Respondents reliance on specific provisions of the

Establishments Code fails to consider the particularities of project-based

employment, where distinct rules apply as defined by relevant Management

Page 9 of 9

Services Circulars. This failure to appreciate the legal nuances of the

Petitioners position has led to unjust disciplinary measures that are

unsupported by law.

In the said circumstances, this court is of the view that the Petitioner has

successfully demonstrated that the Respondents actions were legally flawed,

procedurally unsound, and motivated by an incorrect application of the law.

The suspension of his services, the issuance of the charge sheet, and the

Respondents overall conduct constitute a violation of his rights as a project

employee and an abuse of administrative authority. The Petitioner has

established a clear entitlement to the relief sought, including the quashing of

the suspension and charge sheet, reinstatement to his position, and

compensation for lost wages. The Respondents arbitrary actions, lack of

adherence to due process, and misapplication of regulatory standards

unequivocally entitle the Petitioner to the issuance of Writs of Certiorari and

Mandamus as prayed for prayers (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) of his Amended

Petition.

Application allowed with costs of Rs. 10,000.00/- payable by the Respondents.
