JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Officer-in-Charge of Punewa Police Station (hereinafter referred to

as the Complainant) had filed a case against the Accused-

Respondents-Respondents (Hereinafter referred to as the Accused

Persons) for committing an offence under the Forest Ordinance for

transporting timber without permit in the Magistrate Court of

Medawachchiya under the case No.1429 on 31.10.2022.

As the Accused Persons pleaded guilty to the charge, they were

sentenced accordingly. Thereafter an inquiry was held in respect of the

vehicle involved in this case. The vehicle involved in this case is a

tractor with a Trailor. The registered owner of the tractor and the trailer

bearing No.NC RH 4929 and NC RZ 4519 respectively is the Petitioner

in this case. The Learned Magistrate held an inquiry under Section 425

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 and summoned

the Petitioner to show cause as to why the Tractor and the Trailer

CA PHC APN 45/24

5 | P a g e

should not be confiscated in terms of Section 40 of the Forest

Ordinance. After the inquiry the Learned Magistrate pronouncing the

order on 10.07.2023, confiscated the said Tractor and the Trailer to the

State.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Learned Magistrate, the Petitioner

filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of North Central

Province Holden at Anuradhapura to revise the order of the Magistrate

of Medawachchiya. After an inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge of

Anuradhapura had affirmed the order of the Learned Magistrate of

Medawachchiya and dismissed the said revision application on the

ground that the Petitioner had failed to adduce exceptional

circumstances.

Now the Petitioner filed this revision application to set aside the both

orders of the Learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura dated

27/03/2024 and the Learned Magistrate of Medawachchiya dated

10.07.2023 and to release the said Tractor and the Trailor to the

Petitioner.

The Petitioner submitted following grounds for the consideration

of Court:

1. The learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate have

failed to appreciate that the degree and limits of precautions an

owner of a vehicle could take, depends, and varies on prevailing

circumstances of each case.

2. The learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate have

erred in expecting a higher degree of precautions from the

Petitioner which would have been impractical under

circumstances prevailed at the relevant time.

3. The learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate have

erred in concluding that the Petitioner has thereby failed to

sufficiently show cause in the confiscation inquiry.

CA PHC APN 45/24

6 | P a g e

4. The learned Provincial High Court Judge has failed to consider

the findings of the judgment of Hewapathirana Jayawickrama v.

OIC Mawathagama CA/PHC/143/2018, which were raised in the

written submissions of the Petitioner as an appropriate judicial

precedence to the instant case.

5. The learned Magistrate has erred in refusing to follow the

judgment of Atapattu Mudiyanselage Sadi Banda v. OIC Nortan

Bridge CA/PHC APN 03/2013, which more fully appropriate

under the circumstances of the present case.

6. The learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate have

failed to consider the grave prejudice and substantial loss caused

to the Petitioner due to the impugned orders, especially where the

Petitioner has not even been charged with the crime.

In the revision application there is a burden on the Petitioner to

establish that his petition discloses exceptional circumstances.

In AG Vs.Podisingho 51 NLR 385 the court held that:

the revisionary jurisdiction ought not to be exercised unless

there are exceptional circumstances.

Background of the case albeit as follows:

According to the Petitioner, she is a farmer and she had purchased the

Tractor and the Trailer mentioned above for the purpose of her farming

activities. She had purchased the Tractor and the Trailer by obtaining

financial facility from LOLC Development PLC.

On date of incident the 1st Accused a well-known person of her village

borrowed the vehicle to transport paddy. He had borrowed the vehicle

for the same purpose previously too. But this time her vehicle along

with the Accused persons were arrested by the Punewa Police for

transporting timber without a permit. The value of the timber is

Rs.26,985.11.

CA PHC APN 45/24

7 | P a g e

The Petitioner who is the registered owner of the vehicle giving evidence

had said that when she gave the vehicle to 1st Accused had given

necessary instructions not to use the vehicle for illegal activities. She

only came to know the vehicle had been used to transport timber when

she received a call from a person of her village. When she gave the

vehicle to 1st Accused, she had given specific instructions not to use for

any illegal activity. In her evidence she had reiterated that she gave the

vehicle only to transport paddy. According to the Petitioner the vehicle

never involved in any illegal activity previously and this is the first time

the police had taken into their custody.

Although the Petitioner who is the registered owner of the Tractor and

the Trailer gave evidence how she had taken necessary precautions to

thwart misuse of the Tractor and the Trailer, but the Learned

Magistrate disregarded her evidence on the basis that she had not

corroborated her evidence with necessary witnesses.

It is very pertinent to note that the timber logs transported in the

tractor are less than 2 meters in length.

The main contention of the Counsel for the Appellants is that both the

Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate had failed to

evaluate the evidence led at the inquiry.

The Petitioner is a 54 years old woman who does the cattle farming. She

had purchased the Tractor and the Trailer in order to use in her farm.

In her evidence she said that she had taken all necessary steps to

prevent the vehicle being used for illegal activity. No previous or

pending cases reported.

In Manadadu v.AG [1987] 2 SLR 30 the Court held that:

The Magistrate must hear the, owner of the lorry on the question

of showing cause why the lorry is not liable to be forfeited. If the

CA PHC APN 45/24

8 | P a g e

Magistrate is satisfied with the cause shown, he must restore the

lorry to the owner.

Considering the evidence led before the Magistrate Court and the

argument advanced by the Petitioner, I set aside the order dated

10.07.2023 by the Learned Magistrate of Medawachchiya and the order

of the Learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura dated 27.03.2024 as

they cannot be allowed to stand.

I direct that the Tractor bearing No. NC-RH 4929 and the Trailer

bearing No. NC-RZ 4519 which are the subject matters of this action

shall be released to the Petitioner as she is the registered owner of the

vehicle.

Therefore, this revision is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgment to the

High Court of Anuradhapura and the Magistrate Court of

Medawachchiya for necessary action forthwith.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
