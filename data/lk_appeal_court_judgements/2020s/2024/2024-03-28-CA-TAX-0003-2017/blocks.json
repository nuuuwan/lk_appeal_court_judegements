The above was a case where the taxpayer applied to the Court of Appeal for a writ to quash the assessment on the ground that the Assessor did not give written reasons for rejecting the return. The Court of Appeal granted the writ and the CGIR appealed to the Supreme Court. In the majority judgment, His Lordship Samarakoon C.J. observed that it is a fit matter for writ jurisdiction; writ of certiorari. However, this was not a case like the one at hand where the taxpayer exercised his right of appeal to the CGIR, then appealed to the TAC, and subsequently the CGIR appealed to the Court of Appeal against the order of the TAC. The Supreme Court did not consider the provisions regarding appeals such as those in the TAC Act. As such, there are material differences between the facts of the said case and the case at hand. Moreover, it is important to note that His Lordship did not hold that writ is the only remedy. All that His Lordship observed was that writ of certiorari is the appropriate remedy. It was just a passing remark made in response to a submission made in the case and was an obiter statement.",

Chandrasiri, in his letter dated 6th August 2015, following an additional delay of almost seven months, requested permission from the Senior Commissioner (Appeals) to refer the matter to the CGIR without attempting to reach an agreement within the appeal branch. This request was made because there were only four months and twenty days left within the prescribed time frame16. However, the Senior Commissioner advised the Senior Deputy Commissioner to schedule a meeting with the taxpayer promptly and attempt to reach a settlement. Only if unable to settle, should the matter then be referred to the higher authority17. It was contended by the Appellant that a letter was sent to the Respondent summoning him for an interview on the 20th August 201518. The letter requesting the Respondent for an interview was counter signed on 13th August 2015, seven days before the date fixed for the interview. Thereafter, the Senior Deputy Commissioner (Appeals), in his report dated 11th September 2015, counter signed by Commissioner (Appeals) L.M. Chandrika Weerakoon, submitted the appeal to the CGIR for determination. It is important to observe that the appeal report had been prepared by the same Senior Deputy Commissioner who signed the aforementioned letter said to have been sent to the Respondent19. Therefore, if a letter was in fact sent to the Respondent by the Senior Deputy Commissioner, undoubtedly, he would have mentioned about the letter in his own appeal report prepared on the 11th September 2015.

The Respondent claimed that the letter allowed only five working days for him to attend the interview. In total, there were only seven days, including the time required for postal delivery. Importantly, the Respondent contested receiving the said letter. During the hearing, the appellant presented a copy of the postal article dated 14th August 2015, as evidence that the letter was dispatched to the Respondent's address. The Respondent also submitted the same registered postal article and a letter dated 14th October 2020, from the Postal Department stating that they dispose of registered postal article receipts after two years, hence unable to provide information regarding the mentioned letter. However, in a letter dated 22nd January 2020, submitted by the Appellant, the Postal Department provided information regarding the letter posted on 14th August 2015, five years later. Notably, in the registered postal article receipt provided by both parties, the name and address of the addressee are not specified.

Furthermore, the Respondent outlined the grounds of appeal in a general manner. It's worth noting that the Notice of Assessment was issued on 26th November 2013, while the Respondent's appeal was submitted on 24th December 2013. Thus, the appeal was lodged within the thirty-day timeframe stipulated by Section 165(1) of the IR Act following the Notice of Assessment.",
