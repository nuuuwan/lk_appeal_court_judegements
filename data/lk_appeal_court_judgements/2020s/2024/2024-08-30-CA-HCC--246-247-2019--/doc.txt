JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted along with the 3rd and 4th Accused by the Attorney

General for committing an offence as detailed below:

That on or about the 03rd of June 2003 with others unknown to the

prosecution, the Accused above named, subjected one Waragoda

Mudalige Gerard Perera to torture, in order to extract information or a

confession from him and that they have thereby committed an offence

punishable in terms of Section 2(4) of the Convention Against Torture

and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment,

Act No.22 of 1994 read along with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Negombo and the

prosecution had called 11 witnesses. As the 3rd Accused passed away

pending trial, the indictment was amended accordingly by the prosecution.

The learned High Court Judge being satisfied that evidence presented by the

prosecution warranted a case to answer, called for the defence and explained

the rights of the accused. Having selected the right to make a statement from

the dock, the Appellants and the 4th Accused had proceeded to deny the

charges and called witnesses on behalf of them.

After considering the evidence presented by both the prosecution and the

defence, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the Appellants as

charged and sentenced them to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

4 | P a g e

of Rs.50,000/- each with a default sentence of 3 years simple imprisonment

on 28.06.2019. The 4th Accused was acquitted from the charge.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the 1st

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence. The 2nd

Appellant was present in person as he is on bail pending appeal. At the

hearing the 1st Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

History of the case

Originally the Hon. Attorney General preferred an indictment against 7

Accused including the Accused named above on counts of Torture and

Degrading Human Treatment along with aiding and abetting to commit

Torture and Degrading Human Treatment. Before the commencement of the

trial, the indictment against the 7th Accused - the Officer-in-Charge of the

Wattala Police Station IP/Suraweera was withdrawn by the Hon. Attorney

General and the trial was proceeded against 1st to 6th Accused. At the

conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge who heard the trial had

acquitted all 6 Accused from the case.

As the Hon. Attorney General did not prefer an appealed against the

acquittal, an aggrieved party preferred an appeal against the acquittal in the

Court of Appeal. At the conclusion of the appeal, his Lordship while

conforming the acquittal of 5th and 6th Accused, set aside the acquittal

against 1st to 4th Accused and directed a re-trial against the above-named 1st

to 4th accused.

The Accused above named made a Special Leave to Appeal to the Supreme

Court under case No. SC.SPL.LA 259/2021 against the re-trial decision. On

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

5 | P a g e

2nd June 2014, His Lordship Mohan Peiris, PC., CJ affirming the Court of

Appeal decision held further,

We have taken into consideration the evidence of the brother, Ranjith who

implicates Renuka as a person who was concerned with the transaction.

We are also dissatisfied with the manner in which the O.I.C. (7th Accused

Suraweera) has given evidence. This Court therefore sees no reason to

interfere with the Judgment of the Court of Appeal in ordering a re-trial in

respect of 1st ,2nd ,3rd and 4th Petitioners. We are however of the view that

the Court of Appeal should have gone further in this matter. The evidence

in this case materially touches the conduct of the O.I.C of Wattala Police

Station and Renuka. We are therefore of the view that in the presentation

of the new indictment at the re-trial, consideration must be given by the

Hon. Attorney General as to whether the O.I.C. of Wattala Police Station

Suraweera and the officer named Renuka ought to have made accused or

cited as witnesses, so as to ensure an effective prosecution.

The background of the case

Re-trial commenced and the prosecution called 11 witnesses.

Notwithstanding the directions given by the Apex Court of the country, the

Hon. Attorney General did not make the Officer-in-Charge of the Wattala

Police Station, IP/Suraweera and officer Renuka at least as a witness to

ensure an effective prosecution.

According to PW2 Pathma, the wife of the victim, on 03.06.2002 at about

11.45 a.m. a police party led by the 1st Appellant had come in search of her

husband to proceed with an investigation with regards to the murder of three

persons in the Hendala area. As the victim was not at home at that time, the

Police had subjected PW2 to a lengthy enquiry about the victim. At about

12.45 p.m. when the victim got off from the bus, he was dragged into the

jeep and PW2 and her son were dropped near a boutique namely Countasge

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

6 | P a g e

Kade. PW2 along with PW3, the brother of the victim had gone to Gampaha

Police Station to lodge a complaint but was not entertained.

In the evening on the same day, PW3 had gone to the Wattala Pollice Station

but his brother was not to be seen. When he was seated near the reserve

duty officers table in the police station, he had seen his brother walking to

the Officer-in Charge IP/Suraweeras room with the assistance of SI/Renuka

and another police officer. When PW3 went to the Wattala Police Station

again at about 9.00 p.m., he had seen some police officers applying some

pain reliving balm on the victims body. Their identity had not been

established by the prosecution.

According to PW5, the victim was released on police bail on the direction of

the OIC of Wattala Police Station on the following day by the OIC of the Crime

Division, IP/Nawaratna.

In this case the Appellants admitted that they arrested the victim on

03.06.2002 and that he was handed over to PC 29245 Ratnayake who was

on reserve duty on that day. Although PC Ratnayake was named as witness

number 32 the prosecution had not taken any endeavour to call him as a

prosecution witness. But he was called as a defence witness in this case.

Grounds of appeal advanced by the Appellants

1. The learned High Court Judge failed and neglected to appraise the

circumstantial evidence as required by law.

2. The learned High Court Judge failed to evaluate the evidence of PW3

Francis Ranjith Perera the brother of the victim as required by the law.

3. The learned High Court Judge failed to direct himself appropriately

with regard to the failure of the prosecution to follow the direction of

their Lordship of the Supreme Court.

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

7 | P a g e

4. The learned High Court Judge failed to direct himself appropriately

with regard to the evidence relating to the arrest and handing over the

victim to the police.

5. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by deciding to only acquit

the 4th Accused on the basis that the prosecution failed to prove the

case against the 4th Accused beyond reasonable doubt and failing to

consider appealing against the acquittal of 4th Accused.

As the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellant are interconnected, all

grounds will be considered together hereinafter.

The Appellants contended that the learned High Court Judge erred in law by

his failure to follow the settled law and relevant legal principles relating to a

case entirely based on circumstantial evidence.

Circumstantial evidence gives rise to a logical inference that facts exist. It is

indirect evidence that does not, prima facie prove a fact in issue. Therefore,

such evidence requires the court to draw additional reasonable inferences to

support a given claim.

While in general this type of evidence is admissible in courts, the courts are

rather wary and cautious of cases in which the sole type of evidence available

is circumstantial evidence.

Circumstantial evidence must be treated with caution that is, they should

be closely examined and looked at in connection with other evidence. While

a court would be very hesitant to convict a defendant based on a single piece

of circumstantial evidence. However, where there are more pieces of cohesive

circumstantial evidence, they will bear more weight when considered

together.

In order to convict an Accused person on the basis of circumstantial evidence

it is the duty of the trial judge to be satisfied that that the facts proved are

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

8 | P a g e

only consistent with the guilt of the Accused and the facts proved exclude

every other possibility other than the guilt of the Accused.

In King v Abeywickrama [1943] 44 NLR 254 the Court held that:

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury must

be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the

accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of his

innocence.

In Gunawardena v the Republic [1981] 2 SLR 315 the Court held that

Each piece of circumstantial evidence is not a link in a chain for if one

link breaks the chain would fail. Circumstantial evidence is more like a

rope composed of several cords. One strand of rope may be insufficient

to sustain the weight but three stranded together may be quite

sufficient.

In Hanumant v State of M.P [1952] AIR SC 343; 1953 Cri LJ 129 the Court

laid down following guide lines to be used when a case is found to solely rest

on circumstantial evidence.

(i) The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn

should be fully established. The circumstances concerned must or

should and not may be established;

(ii) The facts so established should be consistent only with the

hypothesis of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, that should not be

explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty;

(iii) The circumstances should be conclusive;

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

9 | P a g e

(iv) They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be

proved.

(v) There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any

reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of

the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must

have been done by the accused.

In this case the Appellants admitted the arrest and handing over of the victim

to the reserve police officer PC 29245 Ratnayake of Wattala Police Station on

02nd June 2002 at 13:10 hours. PW28, CI/Eric Perera who was the Officer-

in-Charge of the Wattala Police Station during the trial, produced the police

books relevant to this case. According to him the Appellants had departed

the Wattala Police Station on 03rd June 2002 at 12:30 hours for crime

prevention duty headed by the 1st Appellant. The relevant entry entered by

the 1st Appellant was marked as P3. The Appellants and the team had

returned to the Wattala Police Station at 13:10 hours and the 1st Appellant

had inserted a detailed entry regarding the arrest of the victim. After the

return entry, the victim was handed over to the reserve police officer PC

29245 Ratnayake. The said entry was marked as P4. In the same book at

page 40, the victim was released on police bail on 04th June 2002. The

reserve police officer who released the victim on bail was not established.

According to PW28, no alteration had been made to the entries entered by

the 1st Appellant. The relevant portion of the proceedings is re-produced

below:

According to PW3, the brother of the victim, had seen the victim walking to

the room of OIC of Wattala Police Station assisted by SI/Renuka and another

officer whose identity was not established, when he went to the Wattala

Police Station at 5.00 p.m. on the date of arrest. On the following day he had

gone to meet the OIC of Wattala with PW5, Thiagiratna and had gotten the

victim released on police bail on the instructions of the OIC. At that time the

OIC had told them that the arrest of the victim was a mistake.

According to PW28, the victim was received by reserve police officer PC 29245

Ratnayake. Though he was named as witness number 32, he was not called

by the prosecution to give evidence. But he was called as a defence witness

by the Appellant. In his evidence PC 29245 Ratnayake admitted that he was

the reserve police officer when the victim was produced to the Wattala Police

Station by the 1st Appellant on 03rd June 2002. He had put the relevant entry

in the MOIB at 13:25 hours and accepted the victim. He had not noted any

abnormality or received any complaint from the victim at that time.

Thereafter he had handed over his reserve duty to PC 26320 Boradeniya

entering an entry in the RIB. The relevant entries had been examined by the

OIC of the station and he was not questioned about the entries by the OIC.

Hence, it is quite clear that the victim was handed over to the reserve police

officer of Wattala police Station on 03rd June 2002 at 13:25 hours. From that

time onwards the victim was no longer in the custody of the Appellants.

According to PW3 he had seen the victim being assisted by SI/Renuka and

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

11 | P a g e

another police officer at 5.00 p. m. on 03rd June 2002 and he was released

on police bail by the OIC of the station on the following day. PW3 had not

seen the Appellants at the police station. Hence, the prosecution should have

called PC 29245 Ratnayake, PC 26320 Boradeniya, SI/Renuka and the OIC

of the Wattala Police Station IP/Suraweera as prosecution witnesses as they

are essential witnesses this case. His Lordship of the Supreme Court had

considered the importance of calling or making SI/Renuka and the OIC of

the Wattala Police Station as prosecution witnesses or Accused in this case,

as there is a break in the evidence pertaining to the involvement of the

Appellants torturing the victim in the police station.

An essential witness, is one whos testimony is necessary to unfold the truth.

Their testimony is so vital, that without it, there really a no case or evidence

to get a conviction in a case.

In Stephen Seneviratne v The King [1936] 3 All ER 36 at 46 where Lord

Roche said:

Witnesses essential to the unfolding of the narrative on which the

prosecution is based, must, of course, be called by the prosecution,

whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case

for the prosecution.

Considering the above cited judgment, PC Ratnayake, PC Boradeniya,

SI/Renuka and CI/Suraweera are of course, essential witnesses and the

prosecution should have called them to give evidence. Not calling the said

witnesses has caused great prejudice to the Appellants. Further, the

prosecution had failed to explain how the victim who was in the custody of

PC Boradeniya ended up with SI/Renuka and another officer unknown to

the prosecution in a severely injured state which create a serious doubt on

the prosecution case.

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

12 | P a g e

In Kumara De Silva v The Attorney General [2010] 2 SLR 169 the Court

held that:

Question of an adverse presumption under Section 114 (f) arises only

where a witness whose evidence is necessary to unfold the narrative is

wilfully withheld by the prosecution and the failure to call such witness

constitutes a vital missing link in the prosecution case.

The learned High Court Judge heavily relying on the affidavits filed by the

Appellants in the FR Application No 328/2002 had arrived at the conclusion

that the Appellants had conducted the investigation about the victim until

he was released on police bail. The learned High Court Judge had failed to

consider the break of events from 13:25 hours on 03rd June 2002 to 11:30

hours on 04th June 2002. Had the learned High Court Judge considered the

Supreme Courts direction with regard to SI/Renuka and OIC CI/Suraweera

and the failure to call them as witnesses along with PC Ratnayake and PC

Boradeniya by the prosecution, he wouldnt have come to the conclusion that

the prosecution had proved the guilt of the appellants beyond a reasonable

doubt. This failure had caused great prejudice to the Appellants rights to a

fair trial.

The prosecution had not made SI/Renuka and the OIC CI/ Suraweera either

Accused or witnesses in this case. But the learned High Court Judge had

considered that the OIC had given evidence in this case. The relevant portion

of the judgment is re-produced below:

Page 1215 of the brief.

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

13 | P a g e

This is a clear misdirection which certainly affected the Appellants right to

a fair trial.

The learned High Court Judge had not considered the evidence favourable

to the Appellants. Evidence transpired that the 1st Appellant was exonerated

by a Deputy Inspector General of Police who held an inquiry regarding the

alteration and entries made in the MOIB. The learned High Court Judge had

not considered this evidence in favour of the Appellant. The relevant portion

of the judgment is re-produced below:

In Hattuwan Pedige Sugath Karunaratne v. The Attorney General SC

Appeal 32 of 2020 Aluwihare PC J., held that:

No doubt the duty of a State Counsel is to present the Prosecution in an

effective manner to the best of their ability in furtherance of securing a

conviction, if the evidence can support the charge. The Prosecutor,

however, is an officer of the court and their role is to assist the court to

dispense justice. Thus, it is not for a Prosecutor to ensure a conviction at

any cost, but to see that the truth is elicited, and justice is meted out. A

Prosecutor is not expected to keep out relevant facts either from the court

or from the accused. It the investigation has revealed matters which are

favourable to the Accused and the accused is unaware of the existence

of such facts, it is the bounden duty of the Prosecutor to make those

facts available to the court and to the defence.

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

14 | P a g e

Defence witness PC Ratnayake had not noted any abnormalities or received

any complaint from the victim when he was handed over to him by the

Appellants. The learned High Court Judge considering an opinion expressed

by CI/Eric Perera regarding police reserve duty, utilized the same adversely

against the Appellants. This too has caused great prejudice to the Appellants.

The relevant portion of the judgment is re-produced below:

Further the learned High Court Judge had come to his own conclusion

regarding the function of the Wattala Police Station and utilized the said

conclusion adversely against the 1st Appellant without any evidence led

either by the prosecution or the defence. This has caused great prejudice to

the 1st Appellant. The relevant portion of the proceeding is re-produced

Although the prosecution had placed evidence before the court that it was

the 4th Accused who recorded the statement of the victim at late hours and

in fact the victim was in the custody of the 4th accused during the period the

victim was in police custody. The prosecution led evidence commonly against

all the Accused. But the 4th Accused was acquitted simply stating the case

against the 4th Accused was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. But the

learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the evidence presented by

the prosecution equally against the Appellant and the 4th Accused. This has

not only caused great prejudice to the Appellants but also demonstrated that

there is a serious doubt in the prosecution case.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread as discussed in Woolmington v. DPP

[1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

The well-known and established presumption of innocence stems from the

Latin legal principle ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat which

means that the burden of proof rests on who asserts, not on who denies. As

such, it forms the basis of all criminal trials which begins with a presumption

of innocence in favour of the accused. Thus, the prosecution, is burdened

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

16 | P a g e

with proving the guilt of the accused to record a finding of guilt against him,

in order to emerge victorious in the adversarial court of law. This

presumption is not limited to the defendant during the criminal trial and

applies in relation to the suspect/accused at the pre-trial phase as well.

In order to find the Appellants guilty of the charge in the present case, all

the circumstances must show that the Appellants are the ones who

committed the offence as charged and not anybody else. It is the incumbent

duty of the prosecution to prove the same beyond reasonable doubt.

E.R.S.R.Coomaraswamy in his book titled Law of Evidence Vol: 1 at page

20 states:

Suspicious circumstances cannot establish guilt. The proof of any

number of suspicious circumstances does not relieve the prosecution

of the burden of proving the case against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt, and compel the accused to give or call evidence.

In this case, after handing over the victim to the reserve officer, there is no

evidence to link the Appellant to the crime that had been committed, as a

very clear explanation had been given as to the whereabout of the Appellants.

The prosecution had failed to bring evidence to rebut the strong position

taken by the defence and failed to bring evidence to prove what happened to

the victim after he was handed over to the reserve officer up till the time

when he was seen by his brother at 5.00 p.m. in the evening. This is due to

non-adducing of the evidence of SI/Renuka, OIC CI/Suraweera, PC

Ratnayake and PC Boradeniya despite the direction of the Supreme Court.

As correctly argued by the Learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the

Appellant, the selective process in naming the Accused and listing the

witnesses by the prosecution has caused grave prejudice to the Appellants

paving a way for a miscarriage of justice. As such, all grounds of appeal have

merits.

CA/HCC/0246-247/19

17 | P a g e

Considering all the evidence presented by both parties, I conclude that the

item of circumstantial evidence led in this case is only consistent with the

Appellants innocence and inconsistent with their guilt.

Therefore, I set aside the conviction and the sentence imposed against the

Appellants and acquit them from the charge.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Negombo along with the original case record.
