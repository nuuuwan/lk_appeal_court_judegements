The petitioner works as a professional consultant for Wagururuwela Oil Mills (Pvt) Ltd, located in

Pannala, primarily focused on the manufacturing, and refining of virgin coconut oil which was

thereafter sold to buyers both local and foreign. The petitioner states that her main role in the

said position as consultant was to introduce clients for the purchase of virgin coconut oil and she

was to be paid a commission in lieu of the purchase.

The 1st respondent is the Officer in Charge of the Special Investigations Unit 01 of the Criminal

Investigation Department and the complainant in the Magistrates Court proceedings bearing No.

B 52644/18 before the Kuliyapitiya Magistrates Court. The 2nd respondent is the director of the

Criminal Investigations Department. The 3rd respondent is the Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya. The 4th

respondent is the Attorney General and is made party in terms of the law.

The matter pertains to the alleged cheating, criminal misappropriation, or criminal breach of

trust of Rs. 39,959,001/- and the petitioner has been arrested on 12. 12. 2018 in connection with

the same, and was granted a strict bail by the learned Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya on 30.01.2019.

The petitioner asserts that apart from a single electronic mail sent to one buyer Mr. Gaston Perera

of No. 796, 4 Winds Way, Mississauga on L5R3W8, Canada, introduced by the petitioner herself

to the company in her capacity as a consultant, which specified instructions for funds to be

deposited into the account of the Project Manager, Mr. K. H. S. Vipula Kumara, there is no

evidence demonstrating any criminal intentions. Furthermore, the petitioner states that she was

not made aware and/or informed during the course of the said investigations that she had been

named a suspect in the Kuliyapitiya Magistrates Court until three officers of the Criminal

Investigation Department arrested her on the 12th of December 2018.

In light of the said arguments, the petitioner seeks the following reliefs:

i. Issue notices on the respondents.

ii. Call for an inspection of records.

iii. Grant a mandate in the nature of a writ of prohibition prohibiting the respondents

from taking further steps regarding the petitioner based on the facts contained in

report No B 52644/18 of the Kuliyapitiya Magistrates Court marked as 'X2'.

iv. Grant a mandate in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing naming the

petitioner as an accused in respect of facts contained in report No B 52644/18 of the

Kuliyapitiya Magistrates Court marked as 'X2'.

v. Grant a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 3rd

respondent contained in X3, banning foreign travels of the petitioner.

vi. Grant an interim order requiring the release of the petitioner's passport by the 3rd

respondent, the Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya and permitting overseas travel.

vii. Grant an interim order restraining the respondents from taking any action in

consequence of the facts contained in No B 52644/18 of the Kuliyapitiya Magistrates

Court marked as 'X2' regarding the petitioner.

viii. Seek a declaration that the petitioner is not guilty of any offense or wrongdoing in

respect of the case bearing B 52644/18 marked as 'X2' from the Kuliyapitiya

Magistrates Court.

ix. Grant costs.

x. Grant any other further reliefs as deemed appropriate by the Court.

On September 20, 2023, the Court of Appeal granted an interim order, deeming an important

matter to be decided in this case. Prayer (f) was granted with restrictions, resulting in an interim

order to release the passport of the petitioner. The travel ban has been lifted, allowing travel for

a short period, when necessary, subject to prior approval of the Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya.

However, the petitioner further applies for the following:

i. The removal of the restrictions imposed on the said travel ban as prayed for in prayer (f)

and to grant prayer (f) in full.

ii. A writ of certiorari and a writ of prohibition against continued criminal proceedings.

Respondents contend that, the petitioner has been remanded, but not for a period of 5 weeks

as initially stated, rather for 3 weeks. Over a span of 2 years and 1 month, the petitioner has

made 4 applications to vary bail conditions, all of which were granted by the Magistrates Court

of Kuliyapitiya. It is noted that the petitioner has not made an application to the Magistrate of

Kuliyapitiya to lift the travel ban. Furthermore, the petitioner has not provided any medical

reason that would prevent her from traveling to the Kuliyapitiya Magistrates Court to hand over

the passport. Additionally, the petitioner erroneously submitted her age as 79 instead of 72

according to her National Identity Card. It is important to clarify that it is not the duty and the

responsibility of the Court of Appeal but rather that of the Magistrates Court to keep a record of

the petitioner's whereabouts. In light of these arguments, the respondents are seeking to dismiss

the application and maintain the original order.

The Court is of the view that, the core issue of the case and potential charges against the

petitioner remains under investigation. Upon careful consideration of the petitioner's plea for

mandates in the nature of writs of certiorari and prohibition against the continuation of criminal

proceedings, this Court finds no grounds to grant such relief. While the petitioner asserts being

a victim of circumstance and alleges a lack of fair investigation, it is essential to note that the

determination of innocence or guilt is within the purview of the legal process. Therefore, the

Court finds no justification to intervene and therefore dismisses the plea for mandates in the

nature of writs of certiorari and prohibition. The legal process shall proceed accordingly, and the

petitioner shall be afforded the opportunity to present their case within the established

framework of law and justice.

The Court acknowledges that an interim order was previously granted, partially granting relief as

per prayer f. This interim order allowed the lifting of the travel ban but imposed the condition

that the petitioner obtains prior approval from the Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya before traveling

overseas. This condition was imposed to ensure that the interests of justice are upheld and to

maintain awareness of the petitioner's whereabouts, given that the case is still pending before

the Magistrates Court. Unrestricted travel at this stage could potentially hinder the ongoing

proceedings. The current interim order, allowing travel with prior approval, provides a reasonable

balance between the petitioner's travel needs and the need to ensure the integrity of the

investigation.

In light of the circumstances surrounding the case at hand, this Court dismisses the petitioner's

application seeking full relief as per prayer f of the petitioner. The interim order remains in effect

with the condition that the petitioner must obtain prior approval from the Kuliyapitiya Magistrate

before traveling overseas.

Once the approval is granted it is valid for 6 months. When 6 months expires the petitioner

should go before the Learned Magistrate of Kuliyapitiya, and get permission to travel abroad.

The judgment is made in the interest of fairness and practicality, ensuring that the individual's

rights are upheld while also maintaining the necessary oversight of the legal process.

Application dismissed, subject to the abovementioned alterations on travel ban.

No order for costs.
