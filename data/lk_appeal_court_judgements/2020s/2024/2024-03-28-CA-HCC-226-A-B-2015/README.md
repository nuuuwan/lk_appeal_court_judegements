JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter after referred as the

Appellant) were indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo as follows:

1. The 1st Appellant was indicted for being in possession of 22.91 grams

of Heroin punishable under Section 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

CA/HCC/ 226 A-B/15

3 | P a g e

2. The 2nd Appellant was indicted for aiding and abetting 1st Appellant, to

be in possession of 22.91 grams of Heroin punishable under Section

54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as

amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

3. In the same transaction 1st and 2nd Appellants for trafficking 22.91

grams of Heroin punishable under Section 54(A) (b) of the Poisons,

Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of

1984.

The date of indictment is 15.05.2011.

After trial the Appellants were found guilty on all counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo had imposed death sentence on all three

counts on 29.09. 2015.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsels for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellant has given consent to argue this matter in his absence due to Covid

19 pandemic. During the argument they were connected via zoom from

prison.

On behalf of the 1st Appellant following Grounds of Appeal are raised.

1. Whether it was lawful for the Learned High Court Judge to amend the

date of offence in Count number one in the indictment to read as

15.10.2010 instead of 15.10.2011 by placing his signature dated

07.03.2013.

2. Whether it was lawful for the Learned High Court Judge to insert the

words ixfYda; fpdaokdj lshjd myod fo' under his signature dated

04.09.2014 (vide page 164 of the brief) after the prosecution closed its

CA/HCC/ 226 A-B/15

4 | P a g e

case on 15.05.2013 (Vide pages 234-235 of the brief) and after the

defence closed its case on 07.08.2013 (Vide page 462 of the brief).

3. Whether it was lawful for the Learned High Court Judge to rely on

Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 to

allow the prosecution to call witness Nihal Mapitigama Liyanarachchi

(retired Government Analyst) (Vide journal entry dated 04.09.2014 at

page 48 of the brief and the evidence of the said Liynarachchi at page

470 of the brief).

4. The prosecution failed to explain as to how the weight of Heroin along

with the covers which weighed 154 grams (Vide page 95 of the brief)

and purportedly the same weighed without covers (Vide page 220 of

the brief) 156.5 grams when the Government Analyst weighed on

06.01.2011 (Vide pages 216-223 of the brief).

On behalf of the 2nd Appellant following Ground of Appeal is raised.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to take into consideration that

there is a strong likelihood for the prosecution witnesses specially PW1

Rangajeewa to falsely implicate the 2nd Appellant due to the enmity

prevailed between him and PW1.

The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Appellant informed this Court that he also

sails with the appeal grounds raised by the Learned Presidents Counsel on

behalf of the 1st Appellant.

Background of the case.

According to PW1, IP Rangajeewa, had received information from one of his

personal informants at around 4.00 am on 15.05.2010 about trafficking of

Heroin in the area of Thalahena. With PW1, seven other police officers

CA/HCC/ 226 A-B/15

5 | P a g e

including a woman police officer had reached Thalahena around 6.15 am.

Their vehicle was turned towards Halbarawa and parked.

While they were waiting, at about 8.15 am, a scooter bearing No. UW-4158

had approached from the direction of Halbarawa. PW1 had stopped the

scooter after proceeding to the middle of the road. The 2nd Appellant was the

rider and the 1st was the Appellant was the pillion rider of the scooter. PW2

IP Perera had checked the 2nd Appellant but nothing was found in his

possession.

Since the 1st Appellant was shocked and was trying to escape when her

husband was being checked, PW1 had decided to search the 1st Appellant.

PW3 WPC Hendeniya was entrusted to check the 1st Appellant by taking her

to the van. Upon checking, PW3 had found a parcel wrapped with a blue

cellophane concealed in the right side pocked of the frock of the 1st Appellant.

As the substance in the parcel reacted for Heroin, the Appellants were

arrested and taken to their house at Thalahena. Nothing was recovered from

their house except cash amounting to Rs.250,000/-. The money was then

handed over to mother of the 1st Appellant. The suspected Heroin weighed

about 154 grams. The production was properly sealed and registered under

production number 98/2010. As the person in charge of the production was

not available, the production was kept in the personal locker of PW1 and

handed over to PW4, PS 26878 Obeysekera on 17.05.2010.

After obtaining court order, the productions had been handed over to

Government Analyst Department on 19/05/2010.

The prosecution led 05 witnesses including the Government Analyst, marked

productions and closed the case. Defence was called and the Appellants

preferred to give evidence from witness box and closed their case.

Reasonable doubt is legal terminology referring to insufficient evidence that

prevents a judge from convicting a defendant of a crime. In a criminal case,

it is the job of the prosecution to convince the judge that the defendant is

CA/HCC/ 226 A-B/15

6 | P a g e

guilty of the crime with which he has been charged and, therefore, should

be convicted. The phrase "beyond a reasonable doubt" means that the

evidence presented and the arguments put forward by the prosecution

establish the defendant's guilt so clearly that they must be accepted as fact

by any rational person.

In Woolmington v DPP (1935) the Court ruled that in criminal cases, the

burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt

beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant is presumed innocent until

proven guilty, and it is not for the defendant to prove his innocence.

As the first two grounds advanced by the Learned Presidents Counsel for the

1st Appellant are connected to trial procedures, said two grounds will be

considered together hereinafter.

The Learned High Court Judge amended the date of offence in the Count one

of the indictment to read as 15.10.2010 instead of 15.10.2011 by placing his

signature dated 07.03.2013

Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 reads as

follows:

1. Any court may alter any indictment or charge at any time before

judgment is pronounced or, in the case of trials, before the High

Court by a jury, before the verdict of the jury is returned.

2. Every such alteration shall be read and explained to the

accused.

3. The substitution of one charge for another in an indictment or

the addition of a new charge to an indictment and in a

Magistrates Court the substitution of one charge for another or

the addition of a new charge shall be deemed to be an alteration

of such indictment or charge within the meaning of this section.

CA/HCC/ 226 A-B/15

7 | P a g e

The Learned High Court Judge had placed his signature on the indictment

after amending the date of offence on 07.03.2013, as the prosecution had

made an application to amend the date of offence. But nowhere it mentioned

that the said amendment was read and explained to the Appellants. Nearly

six months after the said amendment, on 04.09.2014 the Learned High

Court Judge in his own handwriting at page 164 of the brief has recorded

that the amended charge was read and explained and placed his signature.

This was not reflected either in the proceedings dated 04.09.2014 or the

journal entry of the said date. Hence, it is crystal clear that the amendment

done to the indictment was never read over and explained to the Appellants.

This is a clear violation of Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

stated above.

In the 3rd ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel contended that

whether it was lawful for the Learned High Court Judge to rely on Section

439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 to allow the

prosecution to call witness Nihal Mapitigama Liyanarachchi (retired

Government Analyst) (Vide journal entry dated 04.09.2014 at page 48 of the

brief and the evidence of the said Liynarachchi at page 470 of the brief).

Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 states:

Any court may at any stage of an inquiry, trial, or other proceeding under

this Code summon any person as a witness or examine any person in

attendance though not summoned as a witness or recall and re- examine

any person already examined; and the court shall summon and examine or

recall and re-examine any such person if his evidence appears to it essential

to the just decision of the case.

In this case the prosecution closed its case on 15.05.2013. Defence was

called the Appellants opted to give evidence from the witness box and closed

their case on 07.08.2013.

Thereafter, corrections have been carried out on 23.09.2013 and on that day,

the case has been postponed to 01.11.2013 for written submissions of both

parties. The written submissions were filed on 12.12.2013 and the case was

fixed for oral submissions on 19.02.2014. But the journal entry of

12.12.2013 states that the case had been fixed for oral submissions on

27.01.2014. As the trial judge has got transferred, the oral submissions had

finally been fixed on 04.09.2014.

When this matter came up for oral submissions on 04.09.2014, the Learned

State counsel made an application to call PW5 under Section 439 of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. At that point the Learned High

Court Judge without consulting the defence allowed the application.

Thereafter, on 14.05.2015, the evidence of PW5 was led. The evidence of PW5

was recorded nearly 02 years after the defence closed their case.

In M.K.Francis Alwis v The Queen 70 NLR 558 the court held that:

Where, after the cases for the prosecution and the defence have been

closed, the Court, purporting to act under section 429 of the Criminal

Procedure Code, calls a fresh witness whose name appears on the list of

witnesses contained in the indictment, it would be wrong to direct the

jurors that the fresh evidence may be relied upon, either by itself or as

corroboration of the evidence of the principal witness for the prosecution,

to convict the accused.

CA/HCC/ 226 A-B/15

9 | P a g e

In David v Idroos 45 NLR 300 the court held that:

The power given by section 429 of the Criminal Procedure Code to a

Magistrate- to summon and examine a witness at any stage of the trial

should not be exercised in order to call evidence after the defence is closed,

if such evidence puts the accused at an unfair disadvantage.

In Vendendriesen v Houwa Umma 39 NLR 65 the court held that:

that evidence for the prosecution should not be taken after the case for

the prosecution has been closed, when such evidence will have the effect

either of filling in a gap left in the evidence or resolving some doubt in

favour of the prosecution.

As correctly argued by the Learned Presidents Counsel, Section 439 of the

CPC cannot be invoked to fill the gaps of the prosecution case. This is clear

misdirection of the law by the Learned High Court Judge.

In the final ground of appeal, the Learned Presidents Counsel argued that

the prosecution failed to explain as to how the weight of Heroin along with

the covers which weighed 154 grams (Vide page 95 of the brief) and

purportedly the same weighed without covers (Vide page 220 of the brief)

156.5 grams when the Government Analyst weighed on 06.01.2011 (Vide

pages 216-223 of the brief).

Weight is vital to drug charges and matters very seriously in a drug

prosecution. Chain of custody refers to the documentation that establishes a

record of the control, transfer, and disposition of evidence in a criminal case.

In drug related cases the prosecution not only need to prove the case beyond

reasonable doubt but also ensure, with cogent evidence that the inward

journey of the production has not been disturbed at the all-material point.

CA/HCC/ 226 A-B/15

10 | P a g e

To prove someone guilty for possession and trafficking drugs, a prosecutor

must prove that the evidence presented in court is the same evidence that

was recovered at the time of the arrest of an accused. They must be able to

show that the evidence was handled properly and was not contaminated or

tampered with. If law enforcement does not properly handle the recovery

evidence, the evidence can be challenged on the grounds that it was

tampered with, that test results are faulty or inaccurate, or that evidence

was planted at the time of arrest as the criminal prosecutions rely on

evidence gathered by police officers, and it is typically the prosecutors who

must establish the chain of custody.

Proving the chain of custody can be difficult. If law enforcement does not do

it correctly, chain of custody can be successfully challenged in a criminal

case.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although we

take serious view in regard to offences relation to drugs, we are of the view

that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to fill the gaps of

badly handled prosecutions where the identity of the good analysis for

examination has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. A prosecutor

should take pains to ensure that the chain of events pertaining to the

productions that had been taken charge from the Appellant from the time

it was taken into custody to the time it reaches the Government Analyst

and comes back to the court should be established.

The Learned Presidents Counsel takes up the position that the Learned Trial

Judge misdirected himself by failing to analyse the discontinuation of

custody of production chain, which is a substantial fact, which the

prosecution shall prove beyond reasonable doubt and thereby the conviction

is bad in law and unsafe.

According to chief investigation officer PW1 IP Rangajeewa, the substance

found in the possession of the 1st Appellant was weighed using a scale used

in the Police Narcotics Bureau. The parcel in original shape was weighed and

it showed 154 grams. The substance was not weight separately. According

to PW1, the parcel was contained three wrappings.

PW5, Government Analyst gave evidence that the parcel received by the

Department on 19.05.2010 indicated on its cover that it weighed 154 grams.

However, when she weighed the said parcel on 06.01.2011 without the cover,

it weighed 156.5 grams. According to the reason for this weight difference

could be that the Government Analyst Department use a more accurate

scale. This discrepancy cannot occur in this case as the initial weighing had

been done at the Police Narcotics Bureau which is a specialist unit in the

Police Department to deal with narcotics. This unit is equipped with

sophisticated weighing machines and other equipment.

The Learned Presidents Counsel argued the fact that the accuracy of scale

that has been used to weigh the Heroin at the Government Analyss

Department itself cannot explain the difference of 2.5 grams of Heroin,

thereby, such inaccuracy leads to a conviction of the Appellants with a death

sentence under the under the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act.

Hence, the Learned Presidents Counsel strenuously argued that the

prosecution has not properly explained the difference in the weight of the

Heroin which fortifies the case of the defence that the Heroin was introduced.

It is very important to consider at this stage whether the above-mentioned

discrepancy in handling productions in drug related matters cause any

reasonable doubt over the prosecution case as claimed by the Appellants. To

consider this issue it is very important to discuss our Higher Courts

approach with regard to handling evidence pertaining to productions in drug

related matters.

CA/HCC/ 226 A-B/15

12 | P a g e

In Faiza Hanoon Yoosuf v. Attorney General CA/121/2002 it was held

that:

.. The prosecution must prove that, what was subjected to analysis

is exactly the same substance that was detected in that particular case.

In this regard the inward journey of the production plays a dominant

role and is most significant.

As this weight discrepancy is a substantial fact, the prosecution had not put

relevant questions either to PW1 or to the Government Analyst to explain the

reason. Considering the pure Heroin detected in this case, this weight

discrepancy is very significant one which certainly has impacted on the

outcome of the net result of the Government Analyst.

The Learned Counsel for the 2nd Appellant while sailing with the appeal

grounds raised on behalf of the 1st Appellant, submitted to this Court that

the Learned High Court Judge has failed to take into consideration that there

is a strong likelihood for the prosecution witnesses specially PW1

Rangajeewa to falsely implicate the 2nd Appellant due to an enmity prevailed

between him and PW1 as the 2nd Appellant was an ex-police officer. He

submitted further, that the PW1 had kept the production in his personal

locker until 17.05.2020.

All appeal grounds raised by the Counsels for the 1st and 2nd Appellants have

merit. Among them the weight discrepancy is in a drug related prosecution

is very significant and which certainly affect the outcome of the case.

In Mahasarukkalige Chandani V. Attorney General CA/213/2009 decided

on 30/06/2016 His Lordship Justice Malalgoda held that:

Since the court is not inclined to act on the evidence placed by the

prosecution in establishing the inward journey as safe, it is not

CA/HCC/ 226 A-B/15

13 | P a g e

necessary for this court to consider the other grounds of the appeal

raised by the Learned counsel during the argument before us.

Due to aforesaid reasons, we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed

by Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 29/09/2015 on the

Appellants. Therefore, they are acquitted from their respective charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgment to High Court of Colombo

along with the original case record.
