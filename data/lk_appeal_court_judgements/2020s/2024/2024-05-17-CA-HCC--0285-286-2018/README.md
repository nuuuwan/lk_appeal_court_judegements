JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted by the Attorney General for committing the offences

as mentioned below:

1. On or about 07.06.2009 at Kurunegala by causing death of Violet

Mallika Yatawara, thereby committed an offence punishable under

Section 296 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. In the course of the same transaction, committed robbery of jewelleries

worth about Rs.250,000/- thereby committed an offence punishable

under Section 380 read with 32 of the Penal Code.

3. In the course of the same transaction, you dishonestly received or

retained property knowing or having reason to believe the same to be

stolen property, own by the deceased thereby committed an offence

punishable under section 394 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Kurunegala as the

Appellants opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had led 22 witnesses

and marked production P1-P41 and closed the case.

The Learned High Court Judge having satisfied that evidence presented by

the prosecution warranted a case to answer, called for the defence and

explained the rights of the accused. The Appellants had made dock

statements and closed their case.

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellants on 1st and 2nd count only. The

Learned High Court Judge had neither convicted nor made any order on 3rd

count.

After recording Allocutus, the Learned High Court Judge sentenced them to

death on 30/10/2018 in respect of 1st count and imposed 10 years rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10,000/- each for 2nd count. In default, 06

months simple imposed on both Appellants.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellants

had preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsels for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants had given their consent to argue this matter in their absence due

to the Covid 19 pandemic. At the hearing, the Appellants were connected via

Zoom platform from prison.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

The deceased Mallika Yatawara, was a famous business woman who owned

several drapery shops in Kurunegala. The 1st Appellant had worked as a

labourer cum gardener of the deceaseds house, while the 2nd Appellant

worked in the kitchen of the deceaseds house. Although both Appellants

lived in a room of the house, were not legally married. This unfortunate

incident had happened after 2-3 months of assuming duties by the

Appellants.

According to PW2, Upali Madawala, an employee of the deceased, in the

morning of date of incident, he had gone to drapery shops with the deceased,

collected money and returned to deceaseds house. Thereafter both the

deceased and PW2 had counted the money, and the deceased kept the money

behind the curtain. After counting money, PW2 had left the house at about

8.00 am leaving the deceased and the Appellants who were the only

occupants at that time. Further, PW2 had lost his mobile on the very day.

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

5

Around 12.00 noon PW2 had received a call from the deceased and the

deceased went incommunicado from 12.30 pm onwards. As such, PW2 had

gone to the deceaseds house around 1-1.30 pm and found the gate was

locked and no one was there at the deceaseds house. Again, PW2 had visited

the deceaseds house around 5.30 pm but no one was seemed to be there.

As such he had called PW1, Anura Wimalasiri and requested him to come to

deceaseds house as he was in Wariyapola with his wife. After arrival of PW1,

both had entered the house from rear door and found blood stains on the

floor. Also seen the deceased was fallen on the floor in a pool of blood. Hence,

they had informed the incident to the police and few police officers from

Kurunegala Police Station arrived and discovered the deceaseds body inside

the house.

PW1, Anura Wimalasiri was living in the deceaseds house from his

childhood. His family too lived in the deceaseds house with four other

working girls. As the day of incident was a Poya Day, he and his family had

gone to Wariyapola and the four girls also left the deceaseds house leaving

only the deceased and the Appellants in the deceaseds house.

According to PW11 CI/Wickramanayake, he had gone to the deceaseds

house and found the deceaseds body lying on the floor with cut injuries on

her neck. He also had noticed some footprints on the blood. As such he had

instructed the fellow police officers to secure the crime scene. Upon search,

a bag with cash amounting to Rs.12,67,500- was recovered from behind the

curtain and was the same was handed over to the deceaseds daughter.

According to PW13, CI/Piyatilaka who had conducted investigation

regarding the Appellants, he had first arrested the 2nd Appellant upon

receiving information about her from her mother. She was arrested at Ja-ela

after 4 days of the incident and recovered a camera and a mobile phone from

her custody. Although she had not given proper information about the 1st

Appellant, the police managed to arrest him at Ja-ela and recovered two

travelling bags. Inside the same a camera, a DVD player, a Broadband router,

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

6

a mobile phone, a ladys hand bag, a gold chain, bunch of keys, a thread,

two mobile sim covers, several certificates and several bills were recovered

by the police. Further, upon his statement, on 11.06.2009 a pole, a knife,

and a wire were recovered from the garage and the rear of the kitchen of the

deceaseds house. At that time funeral rituals were in progress at the

deceaseds house.

Thereafter, prosecution had called the Deputy Registrar of Fingerprint

SI/Welagedera. He had received 10-foot prints, a fingerprint and a palm print

from the scene of crime. The photographs were taken by PS/28463

Ranasinghe. The photographs had been taken on 07.06.2009, i.e. the date

of offence. After thorough examination and comparison, this witness had

concluded that the footprint recovered on the blood close to the place where

the deceased was fallen tallied with the foot print of 1st Appellant. Another

footprint recovered on the tile floor of the dining area tallied with the footprint

of 2nd Appellant. The report of the Registrar of Finger Print was marked as

P37.

SI/Anura Dissanayake and the photographer PS/28463 Nihal Ranasinghe

had corroborated the evidence given by Registrar of Fingerprint, and also

confirmed that the duo had visited the crime scene on 07/06/2009 and

taken photographs which had been used to prepare the finger print report.

JMO/ Dr.Senanayake had conducted the post mortem examination of the

deceased and noted five external injuries on the deceaseds body. He had

come to the conclusion that the death was caused due to ligature

strangulation and a cut of the throat.

The prosecution had marked the confession of 2nd Appellant through

Hon.Magistrate Ajith Wasantha Kumara as P40. As the defence objected for

the marking, a voire dire inquiry was commenced. After the cross

examination of the prosecution witnesses the defence called 2nd Appellant to

witness box to record her evidence. After the cross examination by the

prosecution, the defence closed their case pertaining to voire dire inquiry.

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the Learned High

Court Judge had allowed the prosecution to mark the confession of the 2nd

Appellant as a production.

After closure of the prosecutions case, the defence was called, and both the

Appellants made dock statements and closed their case. Both the Appellants

denied the charge and blamed the police for fabricating this case against

them.

The 1st Appellant had raised following grounds of appeal.

1. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the well-settled

principles of law relating to a case entirely based on circumstantial

evidence.

2. That the Learned High Court Judge convicted the 1st Appellant based

only on suspicious circumstances and speculations.

3. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to exclude the involvement

of a third party.

4. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to analyse credibility of the

prosecution witnesses and the entirety of the prosecution case.

5. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the important

contradictions and omissions of the prosecution witnesses.

6. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to analyse the defence

evidence in the correct perspective and rejected the same on wrong

premise.

The 2nd Appellant had raised following grounds of appeal.

1. The indictment was not read over to the 2nd Appellant.

2. The dock statement made by 2nd Appellant was not considered and

analysed in the judgment.

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

8

3. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

statement under Section 127 of the CPC which is an exculpatory

statement and not a confession.

4. The Learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

items of circumstantial evidence led against the 2nd Appellant is not

sufficient to draw an irresistible and inescapable inference the 2nd

Appellant entertain common murderous intention with the 1st

Appellant.

5. That the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the

suspicious circumstances do not establish the guilt of 2nd Appellant.

6. That the Learned High Court Judge has not analysed the 2nd charge

in the judgment and not given reasons for the conviction against the

2nd Appellant as per Section 283 of the CPC.

As the grounds of appeal urged on behalf of the Appellants are

interconnected, all grounds will be considered together hereinafter.

Circumstantial evidence, within legal contexts, doesn't stem directly from

observing a fact at hand. It hinges on drawing logical inferences to bolster a

claim. Scrutiny of circumstantial evidence is paramount, especially when

coupled with other evidence. Relying solely on a single piece of circumstantial

evidence for a conviction is typically frowned upon by courts. Yet, when

multiple strands of circumstantial evidence intertwine, their collective weight

increases significantly.

In King v Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 the court held that:

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury must

be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the

accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of his

innocence.

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

9

In Podisingho v King 53 NLR 49 the court held that:

(ii) that in a case of circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial

Judge-to tell the jury that such evidence must be totally inconsistent

with the innocence of the accused and must only be consistent with his

guilt.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge had the distinct advantage of

hearing all the witnesses and observing their demeanour and deportment.

This, no doubt paved the way to the Learned High Court Judge to better

comprehend the case. Further, in the course of her Judgment the Learned

High Court Judge had very correctly commented on how circumstantial

evidence should be approached with decided cases.

In the course of the Judgment, the Learned High Court Judge had correctly

analysed the evidence presented to support each of the items established on

circumstantial evidence. The Learned High Court Judge finally itemized from

point 01-21 the evidence she relied upon to convict the Appellants. Hence, it

is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider

circumstantial evidence in her judgment.

Next, the Appellants contended that the trial judge convicted the Appellants

only based on suspicious circumstances and speculations. Also contended

that the prosecution had failed to exclude the involvement of a third party.

In a criminal trial the Accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty

beyond reasonable doubt. Suspicious circumstances, even though powerful,

do not establish that the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable

ground.

The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly analysed all evidence

placed before her to arrive at her decision. Further, her decision is not based

on flimsy or untenable reasoning. She had very correctly itemised the

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

10

circumstantial evidence from 1-21 to come to her conclusion that the facts

so established were only consistent with the hypothesis of guilt of the

Appellants.

The prosecution is bound to exclude the involvement of a third party if there

was positive evidence of an identified third partys involvement in crime. In

this case the prosecution had very correctly led all evidence pertaining to the

crime and there is no doubt caused as to the involvement of the Appellants.

The Learned High Court Judge had held the Appellants guilty for the 1st and

2nd charges after giving plausible reasons having examined the evidence

presented.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment correctly analysed the

credibility the witnesses to come to her decision. Further, she had the unique

advantage of observing demeanour and deportment of all the witnesses.

Therefore, it is incorrect to say that the Learned High Court Judge had failed

to analyse credibility of the prosecution witnesses.

In Attorney General v Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa SC Appeal S.C.

Appeal No. 79/2008 decided on 06.05.2010 the Supreme Court held that:

Credibility is a question of fact, not of law. Appellate judges have

repeatedly stressed the importance of the trial judges observations of

the demeanor of witnesses in deciding questions of fact (Vide, R. v.

Dhlumayo (1948)2 SALR 677 (A); Merchand v. Butler's Furniture Factory

(1963)1 SALR 885). No doubt the Court of Appeal has the power to

examine the evidence led before the High Court. However, when they go

so far as to conduct a demonstration of the evidence, they observe the

material afresh and run the risk of stepping into the role of the original

court (Vide, King v. Endoris 46 NLR 498; Alwis v. Piyasena Fernando

1993 (1) SLR 119; Fradd v. Brown and Co Ltd; Attorney General v. D.

Senevirathne 1982 (1) SLR 302). The trial judge has a unique

opportunity to observe evidence in its totality including the demeanour

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

11

of the witness. Demeanour represents the trial judges opportunity to

observe the witness and his deportment and it is traditionally relied on

to give the judges findings of fact their rare degree of inviolability (Vide,

Bingham, 'The Judge as Juror' 1985 p.67)

The Counsels further argued that the Learned High Court Judge had failed

to consider the important contradictions and omissions in the prosecutions

case.

The facts set out by the prosecution may not be accurate or even they can

be crooked, in this background the tool of contradiction and omission are

very effective to shake or shatter the credibility of prosecution evidence. Proof

of contradiction and omissions though is very useful in criminal trials, it has

to be used with circumspection and within a legal framework. The credibility

of the witness does not stand impeached merely by proving contradictions

on record. It is required for the defence side to show that prosecution

witnesses may deliberately depose change or improve their original

statement in order to cause prejudice to the accused. Similarly, minor

omission or discrepancy in evidence is not enough to hold the accused not

guilty. Thus, by striking out balance and by evaluating evidence in proper

perspective justice can be done. The following cases are very important in

this regard.

1. State Rep. by Inspector of Police v. Saravanan AIR 2009 SC 152

2. Acharaparambath Pradeepan & Anr. v. State of Kerala 2006 13

SCC 643

3. Kehar Singh & amp; Ors v. State (Delhi Admn.) [3] AIR 1988 SC 1883

In this case the defence could mark only two contradictions 2V1 and 2V2

from PW1s evidence. On perusal of the said two contradictions, the said

contradictions certainly will not be capable to create a doubt in the

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

12

prosecution. Therefore, the credibility of PW1s evidence is not affected as

correctly decided by the Learned High Court Judge.

Both the Appellants complain that the defence evidence was not considered

in the correct perspective and rejected the same on wrong premise.

As correctly pointed out by the Learned Additional Solicitor General, the

Learned High Court Judge has in the course of her judgment reproduced the

dock statement of both Appellants in verbatim. She has also referred to two

authorities on admissibility of dock statement in a criminal trial. At the

conclusion of analysis, the Learned High Court Judge had disbelieved the

defence and accepted the prosecutions version.

Both the Appellants in their respective arguments have taken up the position

that after their arrest they were brought to deceaseds house, taken inside

and made them walk inside the house. According to PW13, the Appellants

were arrested at Ja-Ela after three days of the incident and brought to

deceaseds house on the day of her funeral to recover certain items under

Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Although the Appellant had taken up the position that they were taken inside

the house and made them to walk inside the house after their arrest, the

officers from the Fingerprint Department had visited the place of incident on

the date of incident at about 10.00pm and photographed the foot prints,

palm and finger from the scene of crime. Even they had photographed the

deceased who was fallen in a fool of blood. All photographs were marked

during the trial and the photographs bear the date as 07.06.2009.

The Counsel for the 2nd Appellant brought to the notice of the Court that the

indictment was not read over to her after it was served on her.

According to the journal entry dated 10.10.2017 the indictment was served

to the 2nd Appellant on that day. On 09.07.2018 the Counsel for the 2nd

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

13

Appellant informed Court that all documents had been given to the 2nd

Appellant. On 23.07.2018 the Appellants elected a non-jury trial. Although

reading of the indictment was not recorded but all other steps under Section

195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act such as granting of bail and

obtaining fingerprints of the 2nd Appellant had been done. With the available

materials, not recording could have been an oversight as the trial cannot

commence without reading out the indictment.

Next, the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant contended that the Learned High

Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the statement under Section

127 of the CPC which is an exculpatory statement and not a confession.

In this case the Learned Magistrate had recorded a statement under Section

127(3) of the CPC.

Section 127(3) of the CPC states:

(3) A Magistrate shall not record any such statement being a confession

unless upon questioning the person making it, he has reason to believe that

it was made voluntarily, and when he records any such statement, he shall

make a memorandum at the foot of such record to the following effect: -

I believe that this statement was voluntarily made. It was taken I my

presence and hearing and was read over by me to the person making

it and admitted by him to be correct, and it contains accurately the

whole of the statement made by him.

(Singed) A.B. Magistrate of the Magistrates Court.

In this case a voire dire inquiry was held before the 127(3) statement was

admitted as a confession and made voluntary before the magistrate. All

necessary witnesses gave evidence and Learned High Court Judge made her

order to allow the prosecution to mark the same as PW40 and portions of the

confession relevant to this case were marked in detail by the prosecution.

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

14

In Nuwan de Silva v The Attorney General [2005] 1 SLR 2004, the accused

was arrested and remanded with four others. After about 10 days of remand

the accused wished to make a confession to the Magistrate who recorded the

confession under section 127 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, (the

Code) after giving the accused numerous opportunities to consider the

matter. The Magistrate satisfied herself that the confession was voluntary

and not vitiated by any inducement, threat or promise. At a voir dire inquiry,

the High Court was satisfied about the voluntary nature (validity) of the

confession and admitted it in evidence.

The accused told the Magistrate that he had a love affair with a girl but as

he had no job the marriage was objected to. This was the motive for

kidnapping the boy (on his experience of what he had watched on television),

to obtain quick money as ransom. He enticed the boy to his grandmother's

house by offering birds' feathers and telephoned the boy's father Jayantha

de Silva. As the boy was next to the accused at the time, the accused closed

his nose and mouth and took him to a room where the boy fainted. Believing

that the boy had died, the accused strangled the boy until he really was dead

and dumped him in the cess pit having placed the body in a fertilizer bag.

The accused also told the Magistrate that the reason for the confession was

his sense of guilt and to free four others, his friends, who were also in remand

but not involved in the crime. The accused was convicted of the offences

charged despite his denial by evidence at the trial which was rejected. The

Court held that:

1. The conviction of the accused was justified on the oral and

circumstantial evidence and/ or the confession.

2. The confession was voluntarily made in terms of section 127 of the

Code read with section 24. Factors such as the accused's knowledge of

the strength of the case against him and known to the police or the

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

15

desire to free his friends are irrelevant. Voluntary in ordinary parlance

means "of one's own free will."

3. The burden of proving that the confession was not vitiated by section

24 of the Code is on the prosecution.

4. Having regard to all the factors including the strangulation of the boy

and the concealment of the body of the boy in a cess pit, there is no

doubt as to the murderous intention. Hence the offence of causing the

boy's death amounted to murder and not culpable homicide not

amounting to murder.

In this case, although 2nd Appellant denied any involvement in the case

during the trial, the confession of the 2nd Appellant cannot be considered as

an exculpatory statement as argued by the Counsel for the 2nd Appellant.

The Counsel for the 2nd Appellant advanced another argument that the

Learned High Court Judge had failed to properly evaluate the evidence

relating to Common Intention and also failed to analyse the 2nd charge in the

judgment and failed to give reasons for the conviction against the 2nd

Appellant as per Section 283 of the CPC.

As per the evidence presented in this case, the items of circumstantial

evidence clearly establishes that both Appellants were acting together with

common intention. The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment

considered each Appellants culpability individually to come to her

conclusion. This clearly demonstrates that they were acting in furtherance

of a Common Intention.

The Learned High Court Judge had summarized the items of evidence to

show Common Intention on the part of both Appellants and come to

necessary and only conclusion that both Appellants were acting on a

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

16

Common Intention to commit murder and Robbery. The relevant pages are

In the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the Constitution

of our country provide provisions to rectify any error, omission or irregularity

in a judgment where such error, omission or irregularity which has not

prejudiced the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a failure of

justice.

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No: 15 of 1979 states as

follows:

Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account-

(a) of any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrants, charge, judgment, summing up or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

Unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has

occasioned a failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

17

Article 138 of The Constitution of Democratic Republic of Sri Lanka

states:

The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to

the provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an

appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact

or in law which shall be 111 [committed by the High

Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original

jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance], tribunal or

other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by

way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things

112 [of which such High Court, Court of First Instance]

tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance:

Provided that no judgment, decree, or order of any

court shall be revised or varied on account of any

error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced

the substantial right of the parties or occasioned a

failure of justice. [ Emphasis added]

In this case the learned High Court Judge had considered the evidence

presented by both parties to arrive at her decision. She had properly analyzed

the evidence given by both sides in his judgment. As the evidence adduced

by the Appellants failed to create a doubt over the prosecution case, the

conclusion reached by the Learned High Court Judge in this case cannot be

faulted.

As discussed under the appeal grounds advanced by the Appellants, the

prosecution had adduced strong and incriminating circumstantial evidence

against the Appellants. The Learned High Court Judge had very correctly

analyzed all the evidence presented by all the parties and come to a correct

finding that the Appellants were guilty of committing the murder and

CA/HCC/285-286/2018

18

robbery. Therefore, I dismiss the Appeal and affirm the conviction and the

sentence imposed on them on 30.10.2018 by the Learned High Court Judge

of Kurunegala.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Kurunegala along with the original case record.
