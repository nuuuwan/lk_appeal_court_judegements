Decided on: 02.02.2024

Hon. D. N. Samarakoon J.,

The plaintiff (who has now acquired the epithet original because he is dead)

wanted the District Court of Kuliyapitiya in case No. 8013/L to enter decree,

among other things, declaring that following deeds are null and void.

(i) Deed bearing No. 600/25.03.1985

(ii) Deed bearing No. 601/25.03.1985

Both attested by Mr. Gunarathne Banda Senanayake, N. P. (Attorney at

Law)

This was granted by a judgment of that court dated 01.10.2018.

It is not required for this Court to examine whether that judgment is correct or

not.

The substituted 01st defendant petitioner Samuel Herbert Liyanaarachchi does

not ask for it.

He contests the order of the district court dated 01.08.2016.

The original plaintiff Adikari Mudiyanselage Dingir Banda died on 08.01.1991.

The above order on substitution marked as P.13 made Adikari Mudiyanselage

Chandra Devi the substituted plaintiff.

The present substituted 01st defendant petitioner, who was the 2nd respondent

to the application for substitution objected.

He said the above Chandra Devi had no relationship to the deceased plaintiff.

The learned district judge in P.13 considered the judgment (P.05) and letters of

administration (p.09) [These markings are before the district court] in case No.

540/Testamentary in the same court, by which Chandra Devi has been

appointed the administratrix. He also considered that the appeal by the present

petitioner, the 02nd respondent in that application, to set aside the order made

in the testamentary case appointing Chandra Devi as the administratrix to the

Civil Appellate High Court of the North Western Province as well as the appeal

to the Supreme Court have been dismissed without taking up for argument.

Although the present petitioner (2nd respondent) alleged before the learned

district judge, that, above judgments have been obtained by misrepresenting

facts, the learned district judge considering that the 2nd respondent (petitioner)

is bound by the above judgments, considered section 394(2) of the Civil

Procedure Code.

It says,

4 | C . A . R I I 0 1 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

[Law 53,

20 of

1977.]

(2) For the purposes of this Chapter -

" estate" means the gross value of the estate of the deceased; and

" legal representative " means an executor or administrator, or in

the case of an estate below the value of twenty thousand rupees,

the next of kin who have adiated the inheritance.

Hence he rejected the application of the present petitioner and substituted

Chandra Devi in plaintiffs stead.

The judgment in District Court Kuliyapitiya case No. 540/Testamentary/97

dated 29.03.2000 written by Mrs. J. M. T. M. P. U. Tennakoon, learned

District Judge shows, that, Chandra Devi claimed that deceased Dingiri Banda

was her fathers younger brother. She (Mrs. Tennakoon) decided, that, Chandra

Devi is the soul heir of deceased Dingiri Banda.

In the petition before this Court, the petitioner claimed, that,

(i) Chandra Devi claimed that deceased Dingiri Bandas parents were

Punchi Banda and Ran Menika

(ii) Tikiri Banda (the former 01st defendant deceased) and Dingiri Banda

were brothers

(iii) Dingiri Banda died issueless

(iv) Ran Hami was the brother of Punchi Banda (father of Dingiri Banda)

(v) Chandra Devi is the grand child of Ranhami

(vi) Hence the next of king of Dingiri Banda is Chandra Devi

Now the present petitioner has made a discovery. That is, that, the birth

certificates of Dingir Banda and Tikiri Banda, marked as P. 15 and P.16, in the

former dated 09.01.1928 (in regard to Dingir Banda) does not give the name of

the father although mother is Ran Menika and the latter dated 29.03.1916 (in

5 | C . A . R I I 0 1 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

regard to Tikiri Banda) gives the name of father as Punchi Banda and mother

was Benthara Liyanage PesiyaThilakaratne.

So it is argued, that, Dingiri Banda was no son of Punchi Banda and hence

Punchi Bandas brother Ranhamis grand daughter (as Chandra Devi claims

her to be) is not an heir of Dingiri Banda.

The substituted plaintiff respondent in this case Chandra Devi relies upon the

appointment of herself as the administratrix in 540/Testamentary.

Now the definition of the legal representative under section 394(2) has

following persons,

(a) Executor

(b) Administrator

(c) In case of estates below Rs. 20,000/-, the next of king who had adiated to

the inheritance.

The learned District Judge Mrs. Tennakoon in the judgment of

540/Testamentary in answering issue No. 03 in the affirmative has decided

that Chandra Devi has a right to be appointed as the administratrix of the

intestate estate of Dingiri Banda.

It also appears from page 05 of that judgment, that, the present substituted

01st defendant petitioner was the 01st respondent in that case. There were three

admissions and they are,

(i) The deceased (Dingiri Banda) was a person governed by Kandyan law

(ii) He died on 08.01.1991 and

(iii) He died intestate unmarried and issueless

The above page 05 of the judgment says, that, the 01st respondent Samuel

Herbert Liyanaarachchi in giving evidence has admitted, that, Dingiri Bandas

father was Adikari MudiyanselagePunchi Banda. He has not accepted that the

mother was Ran Menika.

6 | C . A . R I I 0 1 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 0 2 n d F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

The learned judge has considered evidence that there were two marriages of

Punchi Banda, the first one with Pesiya Thilakarathne and the second with

Ran Menika and Tikiri Banda was the child in the first marriage whereas

Dingiri Banda was the child from the second marriage.

The above admission made by the present petitioner in his testimony in

540/Testamentary that Dingiri Bandas father was Punchi Banda is an

admission between same parties as in this case; and in addition to Chandra

Devi could be substituted as per the order of the learned district judge dated

01.08.2016, due to provisions in section 394(2) of the Civil Procedure Code,

this is also a reason that the petitioner cannot now claim on the strength of the

blank space in the 04th column of P.15, that, Punchi Banda was not the father

of Dingiri Banda.

It is too late in the day to challenge the district courts order on substitution

both in law and facts.

Hence the application of the substituted 01st defendant petitioner is dismissed

with costs.
