and 14th Respondents are residents of the said Electoral Area.

(iv) As such the aforesaid 1st to 25th Respondents except the 12th and

14th Respondents named in the original Petition were not qualified

A Table specifying the appointments of members at the said election

The petitioners in their amended petition dated 24 August 2018 marks a news

feature article on Daily Mirror [the website says 21.02.2018] written by Miss

Kalani Kumarasinghe [currently Feature Editor of the Daily Mirror] which says,

as follows, [Lankadeepa newspaper dated 08.06.2018 marked P-6 along is also

filed]

Following campaigns led by candidates starkly divided on various issues,

Sri Lanka on February 11 woke up to the news of a surprise win for the

newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) backed by former

President Mahinda Rajapaksa. What was supposed to be an uneventful

and peaceful election resulted in turmoil with uncertainty ruling the local

political landscape.

While many were concerned over the future of the Unity Government, a

peculiar incident reported from Maharagama meanwhile piqued the

interests of voters and candidates alike. Ahead of the February elections,

the SLPP nominations to the Maharagama Urban Council were

rejected in early December. As a result SLPP announced its support for

the independent group (Group 2) contesting with a motorcycle as its

symbol. Following these developments the Elections Commission

explained that no candidate could resign from contesting until the

elections were held. The Commission stated that though some political

parties announced their backing for independent groups, members of the

elected independent group could not be replaced by members of any other

political party.

11 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

However on February 11, reports emerged that candidates from the

victorious independent group in Maharagama were not residents of the

councils jurisdiction. According to these reports --with the exception of a

few -- most candidates on the motorcycle groups list, were not residents

of Maharagama. The addresses listed next to their names read as

Divulapitiya, Badalgama and Wellawatta.

Many politicians challenged the appointments and questioned their faith

in the new electoral system. Critics included the Janatha Vimukthi

Permanuna and the Social Democratic Party which vehemently criticized

the incident. The Daily Mirror spoke to the General Secretary of the Social

Democratic Party, Thusitha Balasooriya, who took to social media

criticizing the candidates elected to the Maharagama Urban Council.

The SLPP claimed victory owing to the new electoral system. The objective

of introducing the mixed electoral system was to give every village a

representative in a Local Government Authority. This concept has been

exploited by the SLPP. The partys continual request to the public was to

vote for the Pohottuwa or flower bud symbol urging them to heed no

attention to the candidate they would vote for. The result of this was the

election of six candidates of the same family, namely: Bombuwala Devage

Samanmala Janaki, Bombuwala Devage Josephine, Devage Lakmini

Madushani, Devage Vimalawathi, Bombuwala Devage Sujatha

Dharmapriya and Bombuwala Devage Sarath Dharmapriya, Balasooriya

said.

The candidate elected from the Rukmale Division, Bombuwala

Devage Josephine is in fact eighty years old! One of these candidates

is a resident of Ampara, but has now become a council member. This

exploitation by SLPP has been approved by the public as well, he said

questioning the rationale of electing such candidates.

12 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

We have discovered that the Independent Group No 2 which

contested for the Maharagama Urban Council was paid a sum of Rs.

5,000,000. Prior to receiving this sum an affidavit has been obtained

from the independent group as well. A separate agreement had been

signed stating that the elected candidates of the independent group

would tender resignation making way for those in the rejected

nominations list of the SLPP. Such corrupt acts would not only distort

public opinion, but also lead to a significant waste of public monies.

Unfortunately this is not just the picture of Maharagama, but the situation

observed wherever the SLPP has claimed victory, Balasooriya alleged.

The Daily Mirror approached the Executive Director of the Campaign for

Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon to query his

stance on the developments in Maharagama.

When the SLPP got its nomination list for Maharagama rejected they

announced that it would be backing an independent group for the UC,

which was their alternative. This is completely legal. Now we are faced

with a situation where the resignation of elected candidates can make way

for other candidates to replace them. There are legal provisions to do that.

However to make way for this, we need an environment where every single

elected member has to resign. There is no exception for said process,

Tennakoon opined.

The SLPP had an agreement that they would support this independent

group. They arrived at this decision at the very last moment, even after the

postal votes were cast. What we are witnessing is actually a victory in spite

of this group not receiving their postal votes.

Meanwhile the Eksath Lanka Maha Saba Party contesting under the

snake symbol in Thirappane, defeated the UNP, SLFP and JVP with

32.96% votes. Another Independent Group contesting under the Rhino

symbol won a majority of 39.87% of votes in Mahiyangana. According to

13 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

Tennakoon however this is no cause for surprise. It must be noted that

this is nothing new and it was reported from several areas including

Mahiyanagana and Tirappaney.

Tennakoon believes the problem does not lie in the manner in which the

Maharagama candidates earned their votes. The majority of these

contestants never came to Maharagama, they never even knew that they

are candidates for this particular election. But they won a considerable

number of votes. ..

The problem now is that there are some candidates who do not want

to resign. These candidates have been consulting opinions of experts

about the next course of action. They are constitutionally elected members

and it is up to them to decide whether or not to assume duties as council

members. For those seeking to become members of the Maharagama

Urban Council when the elected candidate resigns, it will not be an easy

task.

On the other hand there may be a repetition of what took place in the

Colombo Municipal Council several years ago, Tennakoon said.

He referred to the May 2006 elections, where the UNP nominations

list for the Colombo Municipal Council was rejected, an independent

group contesting under the spectacle symbol secured 23 seats with

the support of the UNP. A Trishaw Driver performed better than

anyone else during these elections and eventually became the mayor.

We were very watchful of the developments during this tussle. There were

several allegations regarding some officers in the CMC. To our surprise no

corruption charges were levelled against this gentleman.

With such experiences in mind, it is my opinion that this sort of

environment will come into play in Maharagama as well.

14 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

The people of Maharagama are fortunate if it transpires in a positive way,

Tennakoon opined.

We must keep in mind that these candidates were voted into power

despite the presence of the candidates fielded by the opposition, including

very senior politicians. The candidates who won in Maharagama may not

be the most qualified and are mostly ordinary people. I have observed that

some of these candidates are very capable of serving the community and

they will not resign. Through this process, a better balance will be created,

he added.

Speaking on the electoral system the CaFFE Executive Director said

the situation in Maharagama is not a failure of the system or the

candidate. It is a failure of the voter. The situation will not be

completely negative and would not be ridden by corrupt politics as

expected. The process that is in formation will be a time consuming

process, and will not happen overnight.

The Daily Mirror also spoke to Executive Director of Peoples Action for

Free and Fair Election (PAFFREL) Rohana Hettiarachchi to obtain his

views on the matter. According to the law, when nominations are

submitted, they require certain qualifications to be registered as a

candidate for elections of the respective area of authority. Qualifications

to be registered as a candidate at Local Authorities Elections are detailed

in a separate section explaining the registration of electors, Hettiarachchi

said.

Accordingly a person, who was on the first day of June in the year of the

commencement of the preparation of the register, ordinarily resident in

any area within the electoral district, is entitled to have his name entered

in the electoral list. According to the Elections Commission, ordinarily

resident means, the said person could be a resident of this particular

electoral area, even though the initial residence is not the same. For

15 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

instance if a candidates temporary residence is in Colombo, whereas

his initial residence is elsewhere, he can be considered as an ordinary

resident of that area where he dwells most of the time. Therefore such

registration is not mandatory for contesting, Hettiarachchi said.

The problem in this instance as reported to PAFFREL, is that this group

comprises residents of Divulapitiya. They have been registered as voters

in this district, but have not registered in Maharagama. We have not been

able to verify these reports. According to our preliminary findings, these

individuals seem to be unaware of the fact that they have been

candidates of this election. So the issue lies in the fact that voters of

Maharagama were misled. I view this incident as an instance where the

voter has been deceived, he stressed.

Hettiarachchi said when the Election Bill was tabled concerns were voiced

regarding this matter. We were of the opinion that a candidate should

be a resident of the respective area, which is the only way to ensure

real representation to Local Government bodies. However the present

legal provisions have been established otherwise. The basic values of

the electoral system is diminished from such occurrences, he said.

Even though similar incidents were reported from several other areas,

only Maharagama has been highlighted. We have received information

that a group of garment workers have been included in a list of

nominations in Polonnaruwa. Deception has been carried out not only

through independent groups. Some candidates have misled voters stating

that government officers would be elected to office. Others had canvassed

for votes fielding one candidate in the list, but presenting another in

the eye of the voter. These were carried out to gain the popular vote. Yet

another case was reported where a group of individuals who were not

residents of the area had contested at elections.

16 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

If they are challenged in court, they would have to prove that they are

qualified to register in that area. Looking at the overall picture we have

observed that voters have been deceived and misled, Hettiarachchi

detailed. Asked if there were legal provisions for such incidents to occur,

he said as long as such incidents are not challenged in court, the Elections

Commission would only reject the nominations based on the following

factors:

1. If the complete deposit is not made

2. If the womens quota has not been fulfilled

3. If the secretary has not signed the nominations list

4. If the secretarys signature has not been certified

5. If the representative does not submit the nominations list

6. If the nominations list is not submitted before the deadline

Hettiarachchi added the Elections Commission is not equipped to

evaluate the qualifications of each candidate within such a short

period of time. If candidates are corrupt, or have been charged in court,

if they are residents of the area, these factors should be challenged in court

by concerned parties. Political parties attempt to represent the people

during elections. The basic premise is that they will not commit a fraud or

deceive the voter1.

Two more passages, which are not quoted here deal with Provisions in law to

challenge erroneous appointments according to one Premathilake.

The feature article concludes saying

Several attempts to contact the Elections Commission failed. However

according to available data, the Daily Mirror has observed that the

17 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

anomalies reported in the Local Government Election were not

limited to Maharagama alone. The confusion of voters and doubts over

qualifications of the candidates as being ordinarily resident of their

respective areas were reported from many parts of the island.

The local government election were held on 10.02.2018. The article is dated

21.02.2018, 11 days after the elections. Hence for whatever the value of this

article, it passes the test of spontaneity.

The petition has been amended in August 2018 and October 2019 because, as

the above written submission narrates elected members who were respondents

were resigning and new members were being appointed.

The bottom line is that except the 12th and 14th respondents, in the original

petition whose names were mentioned, other elected candidates were not

residents within the Urban Council limits of Maharagama.

According to the Executive Director of Peoples Action for Free and Fair Election

(PAFFREL) Rohana Hettiarachchi, who was quoted in the above article,

According to our preliminary findings, these individuals seem to be

unaware of the fact that they have been candidates of this election.

So the issue lies in the fact that voters of Maharagama were misled.

This Court2 had issued notice on the Respondents on 05.09.2018.

On 17.10.2018 the respondents who were represented had been directed to file

objections. Argument had been fixed for 06.02.2019. On (i) 06.02.2019 (ii)

02.04.2019 (iii) 04.07.2019 (iv) 03.09.2019 (top of the list) (v) 19.02.2020 [more

which has been objected to by the respondents] made the argument postponed.

There was an inquiry fixed (apparently on substitution) for 31.08.2022. It is not

clear what became of it. On that day amended caption has been allowed and the

matter was fixed for argument for (vii) 16.12.2022. On that day it was re fixed

for (viii) 13.02.2023. Again to (viii) 03.04.2023. That was the first day this

matter came before the Bench presided by me [accompanied by Justice

Iddawala] due to reallocation of work after the appointment of the current

President, Court of Appeal. The petitioners were absent and unrepresented.

The counsel for the respondent said that the matter has become academic.

I issued notice on the petitioners. On a subsequent day Mr. Panditharatne

appeared and submitted that the matter is of public importance.

Then it was fixed for argument on 25.10.2023, heard on that day; and hence

judgment was fixed to be given by me with Justice Iddawala.

Judgment was fixed for 14.12.2023, having given written submissions date as

27.11.2023. The latter was a mention date. On that day no party was

represented. On 14.12.2023 junior counsel for the petitioner informed that

written submissions were tendered to the registry. There was no appearance for

the respondents. On 26.01.2024 that junior counsel for the petitioner consented

myself giving the judgment as Single Judge, for it was heard by me and Justice

Iddawala. The latter has left judiciary. The Registrar was directed to inform the

counsel for the respondents that the matter will be mentioned on 31.01.2024.

Then after some dates on which there was no appearance for the respondents

the judgment was fixed for 22.03.2024.

The limited objections of 26th and 27th respondents dated 05.05.2022 among

other things state that in a Quo warranto application no substitution is

permitted and when the original respondent ceases to hold office, the application

becomes invalid. The objections of 2,4,15,16,17.19,20,21,22,23,24 and 25

respondents were filed on 21.10.2018.

They cite K. Andiris vs. D. F. Thomarathna 75 NLR 238 in which de Kretser

J., referred to In re Armstrong 25 LJQB 238.

It also says that under Local Government Election Ordinance No. 53 of 1946 the

failure of the petitioners to name the election officer of the Maharagama Urban

Council is fatal.

Next the petitioners submit in their written submissions under following

headings as follows,

Appointment of the Respondents in the Amended Caption (1A, 02, 03,

6A, 07A, 8 to 14A and 15th to 25th Respondents) except the 4 Respondent,

from the nomination paper of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna to fill the

vacancies:

2.8. It is submitted that subsequent to the resignation of members and

with the death of one member originally "elected'" as aforesaid to represent

the respective wards of the said Council, except the 04th Respondent, the

Respondents named in the Amended caption, have been appointed by the

Returning Officer, purportedly acting in terms of the Section66 A(1) of the

Local Authorities Elections Ordinance as amended by Act No. 22 of 2012

and by Act No. 01 of 2016.

2.9 It is respectfully submitted that the said purported above

appointments to fill the vacancies created by the resignation of members

are illegal null and void in as much as in the instant case the nomination

paper submitted by the Independent Group No.2 is ab- initio void and/or

an invalid instrument in as much as all the candidates (except Rajapakse

Mohottige carolis and Tiraj Lakruwan Piyarathna, 2nd and 4th Respondents

of the amended Petition respectively) are not qualified to contest and not

qualified to be elected as members in terms of Section 8 of the said Act.

This point of law is further substantiated by the fact that both sub Section

(a) and (b) of Section 66 A (1) refers to the qualifications specified in

Section 8.

20 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

2.10 It is respectfully submitted that said Act specifically contemplates the

both requirements, namely, the qualifications (under sec.8) and the

disqualifications (under sec.9) a member should possess to be elected and

to sit or vote.

Section 8 of the said Ordinance states thus;

"General qualification for membership

Every person who is not disqualified as provided by section 9 shall

be qualified at any time for election as a member of any local

authority if-

(a) he was, on the date of the commencement of the

preparation or revision of the parliamentary register for the

time being in operation for any electoral area or any part

thereof is situated, qualified to have his name entered in that

register; and

(b) he was, on the first day of June in the year of the

commencement of the preparation or revision of that register,

ordinary resident in that electoral area."

Section 9 of the Act states thus;

"Disqualifications for membership

(1) No person shall, at any time, be qualified to be elected under this

Ordinance, or to sit or to vote, as a member of any local authority, if

such person at that time-

(a) is not a citizen of Sri Lanka, or....

(b) is less than eighteen years of age; or

(c)..

(d) is-

21 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

(i) a judicial officer, or

(ii) a member of the armed forces or

(iii) a police officer or

(iv)..

Therefore, it is submitted that, a person is qualified to be elected and to

sit and vote as a member of any local authority, only if, that person shall

have the qualifications set out in Sec. 8 and shall not have any

disqualifications or should devoid of any disqualifications stipulated in

Sec. 9 of the said Act.

Therefore, the Petitioners submitted that in the instant case, election of

the persons nominated in the Independent Group No.2, except the

aforesaid Rajapakha Mudalige Carolis and Tiraj Lakruwan Piyarathna, are

ab-initio void in as much as those persons are not residents of the electoral

area. This is borne out by the extracts of the electoral register in respect

of the 44 persons included in the nomination paper of the Independent

Group No. 2 marked A1 to A44.

It is submitted further out of the extracts marked A1 to A44, only the

aforesaid Rajapaksha Mudalige Carolis (A12) and Tiraj Lakruwan

Piyarathna (A14) are residents outside the local limits of Maharagama

electoral area and not qualified to be elected and sit or vote as members of

the Mahragama Urban Council. [It should be, that, except those two the

others are residents outside the electoral area of Maharagama].

A.12 is actually Mohottige Carolis Rajapakshe. His residence as per A.12 is in

498/A Makumbure North Grama Niladhari Division. A.14 Galkanda Arahchige

Viraj Lakruwan Piyarathne as per A.14 is from the same Grama Niladhari

division. Others among A.01 to A.44 are residing outside the Urban Council

Limits of Maharagama.

In regard to the others, for instance A.01 Hewa Thondilage Jayaseeli resides at

Pamankada West. A.05 Galkanda Arachchige Sisira Piyaratne at Divulapitiya in

Gampaha. A.09 Hathurusinghe Dewage Sunethra Priyadarshanie also at

Ranadheerage Lakmalie Dilrukshi at Bollatha South at Gampaha. A. 35

Pushpha Damayanthi Vidanegamage at Hulftsdorp South. A.42 Goluva

Marakkalage Tony Shantha is from Kochchikade South. A.44 Hathurusinghe

Devage Nuwan Madushanka is from Marmite State, Akarangaha, Gampaha.

What is the independent interest these people have to serve the voters in the

Urban Council area of Maharagama?

It is pertinent to consider the global position in democracies.

The Underpinning Rationale of Electoral Candidacy:

The concept of being an 'electoral' before becoming a 'candidate' underpins

the very essence of democracy and societal representation. This motto not

only ensures diversity and inclusivity within leadership positions but also strives

to guarantee that democratic leaders authentically understand, represent, and

empathise with the population and its corresponding needs and challenges.

Thus, this analysis can conclude with the affirmation that the concept of a

candidate being an electoral initially proves instrumental in maintaining the

democratic standards.

Being an active participant in any democratic process requires a fundamental

understanding of the procedures, rights, and responsibilities entailed. This part

seeks to undertake an analysis of the assertion that to be a candidate, one

should first be an electoral.

Democracy, eponymous for its methodology of selecting leaders through eligible

citizen voting, holds electoral candidacy as its nucleus. In essence, candidacy

23 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

means declaring one's ambition to run for a public office position while being an

electoral signifies a member of the electorate, referring to all eligible voters3.

The principle of no taxation without representation chiefly spearheads the

democratic perception of governance. Hence, it posits that political leaders

should represent the demographics thereby conferring absolute relevance to the

ideology which grounds the argument that candidates should be drawn from the

electorate4.

Electoral candidates are potential leaders who propose to utilise public power

and resources to deliver public goods. It is therefore logical that such individuals

should have a perceivable stake in the governance process by being part of the

electorates. This ensures they understand and share the public sentiment,

offering innovative solutions to societal problems they too are affected by5.

Historical context further illuminates the significance of this concept. The

exclusion of women and slaves from the electorate and candidature narrate a

story of their social and political marginalization. Their lack of representation

painted a lopsided reality, lacking in diversity and consequently, the democratic

ethos. This historical trajectory strengthens the discourse validating the

interconnection between being an electoral and a candidate, arguing for a fair

and balanced representation6.

Furthermore, legal regulations in democracies around the world insist citizens

be part of the electorate before considering candidacy. The UK's Representation

of the People Act, for instance, provides legal backing to this assertion7.

Giving consideration to the historical, legal, and democratic implications, the

idea that one must first be of the electorate to seek candidacy comes to be

3 (Paragraph 1, [1](https://www.parliament.uk/about/how/elections-and-voting/)) 4 (Paragraph 2, [2](https://www.history.com/topics/american-revolution/no-taxation-without-representation). 5 (Paragraph 3, [3](https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy)). 6 (Paragraph 4, [4](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2646142)). 7 (Paragraph 5, [5](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/2)).

interpreted as an essential democratic provision. It bolsters the essential

democratic concepts of fairness, representation, and synchronisation in the

dimensions of societal and governance realities. Only by recognising this

interconnected relationship can democracies ensure that they perseveringly

sustain their fundamental democratic ethos.

The petitioners further say in the above written submissions, that,

3. Should the Nomination Paper submitted by the Independent Group

No2, have been rejected by the Returning Officer?

3.1. Section 31 of the Act state thus;

"31. Rejection of nomination papers

(1) The assistant returning officer shall, immediately after the expiry

of the nomination period, examine the nomination papers received

by him and reject any nomination paper-

a) that has not been delivered in accordance with the

provisions of subsection (5) of section 28 or

(b) that does not contain the total number of candidates

required to be nominated under sub section (2) of section 28

or [should connect to section 08? How he should satisfy

himself. Not mechanical satisfaction]

(c)..

[Emphasis added in the written submissions of the petitioners].

The returning officer has a duty to examine that the candidates are qualifiedin

terms of section 08, not merely satisfy with the number. This can be done by

merely examining the nomination paper itself where addresses of the candidates

are given.

25 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

It is further submitted, that,

3.3. Had Returning officer examined the nomination paper of the

Independent Group No. 2, he should have noticed or observed himself that

there were not sufficient number of qualified candidates included in the

nomination paper and he should have rejected that nomination paper in

terms of Section 31(1) of the Act.

Therefore it is respectfully submitted that the nomination paper submitted

by the Independent Group No.2 is [a] nullity and /or void utterly without

existence or effect in law for violating Sec.28 (2) of the said act namely, not

setting out the names or otherwise not including such number of

candidates qualified under section 8 to represent each ward of the

Maharagama Urban Council. It is respectfully submitted that in this

instance there should be 25 qualified candidates plus another thirty per

centum of [the] total number in the additional list according to Section

28(2) (b).

Therefore it is respectfully submitted that as such the said nomination

paper submitted by the Independent Group No.2 is [a] nullity or void ab

initio and has no legal effect.

The petitioners have reproduced the material parts in section 31 in full in their

written submissions. It is as follows,

31. (1) The returning officer shall, immediately after the expiry of the

nomination period, examine the nomination papers received by him and

reject any nomination paper-

(a) that has not been delivered in accordance with the provisions of

subsection (5) of section 28, or

(b) that does not contain the total number of candidates required

to be nominated under subsection (2) of section 28; or.

26 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

Section 28(2) of the Act says, that,

(2) Any recognized political party or any group of persons contesting as

independent candidates (hereinafter referred to as an "independent

group") may for the purpose of election as members of any local authority

submit one nomination paper substantially in the form set out in the

First Schedule, setting out the names, in order of priority, of (i) such

number of candidates as is equivalent to the number of members

including the Mayor and Deputy Mayor to be elected for that local

authority (ii) increased by one-third of such number of members. The

returning officer shall as soon as practicable make a copy of each

nomination paper received by him and display such copies of nomination

paper on his notice-board. [Emphasis added in this judgment] [The

Roman (i) and (ii) have been introduced by me, for the sake of clarity

in explaining below].

The nomination paper submitted by the Independent Group 02 did not contain

(i) and (ii) above as it will appear from the above analysis. Hence there is no

question that it must have been rejected by the returning officer, on the basis,

that, there were no required number of candidates.

Hence this Court accepts the position of the petitioners that the

nomination paper of the Independent Group No. 02 was void ab initio and

invalid.

The petitioners further submit, that,

4. Appointment of candidates set out or listed in the nomination

paper submitted by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, which had

been rejected by the Returning Officer earlier to fill the vacancies

created by the resignation:

4.1. It is respectfully submitted that, as evidence by the aforesaid extracts

of electoral register marked A1 to A 44, except the two names referred to

27 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

above are not qualified under Sec.8 of the said Act to become members of

the said Council. After the resignation of all those candidates set out in

the nomination paper submitted by the independent Group No.2, the

group leader had requested, purportedly under Sec.66A (1) (a) of the said

Act, [for] the Returning officer to fill the vacancies, from the rejected list of

candidates of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna.

Thereafter the Returning Officer appointed candidates of the said list as

more fully demonstrated in the Table marked "Z-2" stated above by

gazettes notifications marked P11 and P-14 to P-22.

42. It is respectfully submitted that, appointments of candidates in the

above manner by the said gazettes marked P-14, P17, P17A, P17B, P17D

to P22, are ultra vires the said Act, as such the said appointments are also

[a] nullity and /or void ab-initio without any existence or effect in law.

Section 66A was inserted by Amendment Act No. 22 of 2012. Section 66A(1)(a)

reads as follows,

Filling of vacancies in local authorities.

66A. (1) Where the office of a member of a local authority falls vacant

under the provisions of the Municipal Councils Ordinance (Chapter

252) Urban Councils Ordinance (Chapter 255) or the Pradeshiya Sabha

Act, No. 15 of 1987, as the case may be, the returning officer appointed

for the electoral area in which such local authority is situated, shall, where

such vacancy is in respect of a member

(a) elected for any ward in that electoral area by ballot, request the

secretary to the recognized political party or the leader of

the independent group, as the case may be, to which such

member belongs, to nominate within thirty days of the

occurrence of the vacancy, any other person who is qualified

under section 8 of this Ordinance to be elected as a member of

28 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

local authority to fill that vacancy in the ward in which the

vacancy has occurred; or [Emphasis added in this judgment]

Here when vacancies arose on positions filled by those elected from Independent

Group 02, they were purportedly filled (a) from the list of Sri Lanka Podujana

Peramuna (b) which list has been already rejected.

If (a) is ultra vires [the Act does not permit it] (b) is irrational and disproportionate

[that list was rejected, which means, that, it is not there]

Now what does the case cited for the respondents say?

1969 Present : de Kretser, J., and Wijayatilake, J.

K. ANDIRIS, Petitioner, and D. F. THOMARATNA, Respondent

S. C. 293 / 69-Application for a Writ of Quo Warranto

Quo warranto-Requirement that application should not be filed until respondent

had already assumed office-Person elected as member of a Village Council-Date

when he assumes office-Village Councils Ordinance (Cap. 257), s. 11 (1) (2).

A writ of quo warranto does not lie unless the person proceeded against has already assumed office

at the time when the application for the writ is filed. Accordingly, where a person is alleged to have

been elected as a member of a Village Council when he was disqualified for election, an application

for a writ of quo warranto to set aside the election on that ground will not lie if objection is

taken in limine that on the date of the application the respondent, although he had been

elected, had not yet assumed office as member in conformity with the requirements of section

11 (2) of the Village Councils Ordinance.

The respondents rely on what de Kretser J., referred to as the principle

established in In re Armstrong (1856) 25 L. J. Q. B. 238.

29 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

His Lordship Justice de Kretser said at the last three paragraphs of that

judgment that

As was pointed out in Re Armstrong the Writ of Quo Warranto does not lie unless

the Court is satisfied that the person proceeded against has been in actual possession

and user of the office.

Halsbury Vol. 11 (Simonds Ed.) Page 148 points out that a mere claim to be admitted to office

was not sufficient; there had to be a possession or user as well as a claim. In the instant case

the Respondent could not be the Member for Ward 2 until July 1969 for Section 11 (2) of

Cap. 257 provided that his predecessor continued in office until that time.

Swan J. pointed out in Dharmaratne v. The Commissioner of Elections et al.2 that where a

person has been irregularly elected as a member of a local body but had not yet assumed office

the proper remedy to have his election set aside is not by Quo Warranto.

The position of the respondents is that since those who were elected from the

Independent Group 02 either resigned prior to the institution of the petition or

subsequent to that, prior to the hearing, the writ of Quo Warranto would not lie.

But, that is not what the above case says.

In K. ANDIRIS, Petitioner, and D. F. THOMARATNA, Respondent as well as

in Armstrongs case, the person elected had not yet assumed office.

The judgment says, the Writ of Quo Warranto does not lie unless the Court is

satisfied that the person proceeded against has been in actual possession and

user of the office Now in this case, the respondents against whom that writ is

sought have been in possession of that office, whether they subsequently

resigned or not and action purportedly taken in terms of section 66A(1)(a) arises

due to such vacancies created, which is a result of, or in other words, which was

caused by, those respondents having been in possession; and them having

vacated those offices.

30 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

Hence there is no reason, not to issue the writ, on account of the purported

principle in In re Armstrong 1856.

In regard to the alleged futility of adjudicating the present application, for the

period of the council is over, the petitioners have referred to CENTRE FOR

POLICY ALTERNATIVES (GUARANTEE) LIMITED AND ANOTHER v.

DAYANANDA DISSANAYAKE, COMMISSIONER OF ELECTIONS AND OTHERS

2003 (1) SLR 293 in which Justice Mark D. H. Fernando said, that,

FUTILITY

At the commencement of the hearing both learned President's Counsel for

the Respondents submitted that the 2nd Respondent had ceased to hold

office as Chief Minister and that it would be futile to hear and determine

the appeals. Both learned Counsel for the Petitioners contended that the

2nd Respondent had ceased to hold office even prior to the grant of special

leave to appeal, but that no objection was taken at that stage; and that

special leave to appeal had been granted on a matter of great public

importance. If the objection of futility is now upheld, the Court of Appeal

judgement will be regarded as authoritative and binding, in respect of all

future vacancies in any Provincial Council, and the Commissioner would

be bound to act on the basis of that judgment, thereby giving rise to fresh

litigation.

In this case we are not faced with a situation in which the impugned

decision or declaration had ceased to be operative before the litigation

commenced (as in Punchi Singho v Perera,) or where an order for relief

might be futile because the official to whom it was directed had lawful

authority to revoke it (as in Ramaswamy v Moregoda). On the contrary,

it is the law's delays which have given rise to the objection of futility.

In Sundarkaran v Bharathi, the petitioner prayed for certiorari to quash

the refusal to issue him a liquor licence for 1987 and for mandamus to

grant him that licence. In September 1987 the Court of Appeal dismissed

31 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

the application. In November 1988 - long after the end of the relevant year

- this Court set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal, quashed the

decisions of the respondents, and ordered that the Respondents should

make due inquiry upon its merits in regard to any future application which

the Petitioner might make for a liqour licence. Amerasinghe, J, observed

that the Court would not be acting in vain, and that quashing the decision

not to issue him a licence for 1987 and requiring that he be fully and fairly

heard before a decision is arrived at with regard to any future application

would not be a useless formality.

The petitioners have cited the case of Sudhakaran vs. Bharathie a judgment of

the late Dr. A. R. B. Amerasinghe given in November 1988. In SUDHAKARAN v.

BHARATHI AND OTHERS decided in September 1987, the Court of appeal

dismissed the petitioners case.

However, in the Supreme Court in November 1988, Justice Amerasinghe said,

that,

I do not believe that this Court will be acting in vain or that quashing the

determination of the 1st Respondent not to renew the Petitioner-Appellant's

licences for the year 1987 and requiring that the Petitioner-Appellant be

fully and fairly heard before a decision with regard to any future

applications for licences are made, will be only a useless formality.

I would express no opinion on the question of the validity of the Circular

in question or the validity of Paragraph 5 thereof because it is unnecessary

for me to do so having regard to the opinion I have reached on the third

and fourth propositions of Counsel for the Petitioner-Appellant. I prefer to

leave these important questions open until they arise in a case where

decisions on them are necessary.

[1989 (1) SLR page 46 at page 62]

32 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

In paragraph 6.2 of the written submissions, which is reproduced below, the

petitioners draw parallels to laws delays in that case decided by Justice Mark

Fernando and in this case.

6.2. It is respectfully submitted that, this application was filed in July

2018, soon after the Local Government election was held. It is submitted

that application could not take up for hearing due to several reasons, inter

alia the resignations of members on numerous occasions and the

appointments of new members by the returning officer to replace those

who resigned as depicted in [Z.2] The Covid -19 Pandemic disturbed the

functioning of courts regularly. It is submitted as held by the Supreme

Court, law's delay which has caused the objection of futility, would not

prevent a court hearing a case and the Court would not be acting in vain.

It is respectfully submitted that in this application too, the Petitioners, are

residents of the Maharagama Urban Council, who are interested in the

proper functioning of Council by democratically appointed members and

therefore should not deny Justice.

As per the news item from the Daily Mirror quoted extensively above, it appears,

that, not only at Maharagama in February 2018, but similar incidents have

taken place in various electorates in the island, including an incident

(i) in May 2006 elections,

(ii) where the UNP nominations list for the Colombo Municipal Council was

rejected,

(iii) an independent group contesting under the spectacle symbol secured

23 seats with the support of the UNP and

(iv) A Trishaw Driver performed better than anyone else during these

elections and eventually became the mayor

If, the votes cast have been cast so, in that persons name and have been

influenced by his own candidature and nothing else, that persons cast, creed,

religion, race, occupation (lawful) or any other creation of the human mind to

33 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

classify Homo Sapiens Sapiens into groups will not matter for his appointment

as his worship the mayor or to any high office. That is the spirit of democracy.

But if, that person gets, at least, a lions share of votes cast to him, in

consideration of the might and popularity of a party of which the list has been

rejected, there is a difference. But that is not the question for decision in this

case. The question for decision in this case is (a) whether the list of Independent

Group 02 did not fulfil the requirements in section 8(b) of Local Authorities

Elections Ordinance No. 53 of 1946 (as amended) (b) whether it should have

been rejected by the returning officer in terms of the provisions of section 31(1)(b)

of the Ordinance read with section 28(2) of the Ordinance; and (c) whether the

filling of the vacancies created by resignation, etc., of the candidates elected from

Independent Group 02 list by another political party whose list was rejected is

intra vires the provisions of section 66A(1)(a) of the Ordinance.

As it has not arisen in this case for decision, this Court does not decide the wider

question, whether when the list of party A is rejected, it can ask its voters to vote

for group B.

Whether candidates of group B can get elected by votes that would have been

cast for party A; had not its list been rejected; and can those elected from group

B now carry on what the candidates of party A would have done, had their list

not been rejected, are matters of agreement; and in any event do not arise for

decision in this case.

But whether in the above scenario (a) the list of group B did not fulfil

requirements that it should have fulfilled in law (b) must have been rejected or

(c) the legality of filling vacancies created due to resignation, etc., of members of

group B from the rejected list of party A are the questions for decision in this

immediately previous paragraph; and as that appears to have taken place in the

past; and will take place in the future; and questions similar to those in (a) (b)

As for the law, the petitioners refer to Wade & Forsyth 10th edition page 250,

All invalid administrative acts are void in law and page 251 The

presumption of validity and retrospectivity.

12th Edition of Wade in 2023 says thus,

In the 12th edition Wade deals with Invalidity and Voidness which includes All

invalid administrative acts are void in law and The presumption of validity and

retrospectivity in greater detail and depth from page 228 to 231, which is quoted

as follows, [Beginning of the Quotation]

4. INVALIDITY AND VOIDNESS

A. ALL INVALID ADMINISTRATIVE ACTS ARE VOID IN LAW

An act or order which is ultra vires is a nullity, utterly without existence or effect

in law. That is the meaning of 'void', the term most commonly used. In several

decisions the House of Lords has made it clear that 'there are no degrees of

nullity' and that errors such [From page 228] as bad faith, wrong grounds and

breach of natural justice all necessarily involve excess of jurisdiction and

therefore nullity. This was merely to restate what has always been a fundamental

rule. Lord Diplock made it clear that 'void' is the correct term in any such context,

saying:

It would, however, be inconsistent with the doctrine of ultra vires as it has

been developed in English law as a means of controlling abuse of power by

the executive arm of government if the judgment of a court in proceedings

properly constituted that a statutory instrument was ultra vires were to

have any less consequence in law than to render the instrument incapable

of ever having had any legal effect. [In the Hoffman La Roche case]

Quoting this passage with approval, Lord Irvine LC has said that when an act or

regulation has been pronounced by the court to be unlawful, it is then recognised

as having had no legal effect at all. This consequence flows from the ultra vires

principle or equally acceptably from the rule of law. The Supreme Court has

been equally emphatic: an unlawful act was 'null and of no effect. The voidness

of invalid acts also flows from the classic approach to ouster clauses and the

necessity of collateral challenge to the rule of law as explained elsewhere. But,

as will be seen, an absolute approach to invalidity, although principled and

resting upon high authority, poses conundrums that need to be understood

in order to be resolved.

B. VOID ACTS (WHATHER THE DEFECT IS LATENT OR PATENT) MAY

APPEAR VALID UNTIL SET ASIDE BY A COURT

The first of these is that an invalid act may not appear to be invalid, and

persons will act on the assumption that it is valid. In a well-known passage

Lord Radcliffe said

An order, even if not made in good faith, is still an act capable of legal

consequences. It bears no brand of invalidity upon its forehead. Unless the

necessary proceedings are taken at law to establish the cause of invalidity

and to get it quashed or otherwise upset, it will remain as effective for its

ostensible purpose as the most impeccable of orders. [Regina (Miller) vs.

The Prime Minister [2019] UKSC 41]

This is a description of an act that is voidable (i.e. valid until set aside by the

court). And in many cases, such an act can only be effectively resisted in law by

obtaining the decision of the court. The necessity of recourse to the court has

been pointed out repeatedly [Page 229] in the House of Lords and Privy Council,

without distinction between patent and latent defects. To the same effect is this

statement by Lord Irvine LC

36 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

No distinction is to be drawn between a patent (or substantive) error of law

or a latent (or procedural) error of law. An ultra vires act or subordinate

legislation is unlawful simpliciter and, if the presumption in favour of its

legality is overcome by a litigant before a court of competent jurisdiction,

is of no legal effect whatsoever. [Boddington vs. British Transport Police

[1999] 2 A. C. 143]

Lord Diplock had added that there might be no one entitled to sue, for example

if a statutory time limit had expired. In that case the order would have to stand.

Cooke J expressed the same idea in a New Zealand case: Except perhaps in

comparatively rare cases of flagrant invalidity, the decision in question is

recognised as operative unless set aside.

Yet even in the case of flagrant invalidity it remains necessary for the court to

pronounce. It cannot be right to say, as Lord Denning MR once did of a

defective rating list, that there is no need for an order to quash it. It is

automatically null and void without more ado8'. The only difference is, as Lord

Irvine LC has pointed out, that the citizen may feel sure enough of their ground

to take no action and rely on the invalidity if they should be sued or prosecuted.

But that is their decision, and they must accept the risk of uncertainty. Only the

court's judgment can eliminate that risk. The availability of collateral challenge

at least ensures that the citizen cannot be coerced on the basis of an illegality.

C. THE STATUS OF ACTS MADE ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT EARLIER

ACTS ARE VALID

If an invalid act has no effect at all, then an act made on the assumption

that an earlier act (now known to be invalid) was valid, would itself be

8 Lord Denning here is perfectly correct in principle. It is in perfect accord with Chief Justice Kinseys opinion in November, 1794, in The State vs. Justices, & c., of Middlesex 1 N. L. J. 244, Supreme Court of Judicature of New Jersey, THE STATE vs. JUSTICES, & c., OF MIDDLESEX. November Term, 1794, which I quoted in detail in my judgment in C. A. RII 46 2023 dated 15.02.2024. But the rule against that principle of justice is based on policy to safeguard third parties who may have dealt with the creation of the voidable and wrong and also unjustifiable position of law.

37 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

invalid: for otherwise this would be to give some legal effect to that first

invalid act. For instance, A may be convicted before the justices of breaching a

byelaw, but in later proceedings it may be established that the byelaw was

tainted by illegality and consequently quashed. Is the conviction of A valid?

Surely not if the quashing of the byelaw denies any legal effect to it?

But for brutally practical reasons some legal effect has to be given to

invalid acts. The law is not omnipotent; it cannot set everything right9.

Unlawful activity may [and does] have effects which cannot be rectified. Innocent

third parties will have done all sorts of things that cannot be reversed or which

it would be gravely unjust to reverse... The law cannot wash away all signs of

illegality. Here then is the conundrum that invalid acts are theoretically void but

functionally voidable. And the challenge set for administrative law theory is to

give a principled account of the legal effect of invalid acts. Which are the acts

which if invalid, bring all that comes after them tumbling down? And which are

the acts, all be they invalid, that may be relied upon to make valid later decisions.

Several ways of resolving this conundrum have been put forward, these are

discussed below. [page 230]

D. THE DOMINO EFFECT: AN INVALID ACT KNOCKS OVER ALL THAT

COMES AFTER

But this is the context in which a few words may be added on the Supreme

Court's approach to this issue in the case about judicial review of the prime

minister's advice to Her Majesty to prorogue Parliament. [Regina (on the

9 This is the result of the existence of the Comma of Pythagoras, which I perceived at least in 2017, to be, that which prevent the dispensation of absolute justice. The Pythagorean comma is a small interval that results from the difference between twelve perfect fifths and seven octaves. It is also the difference between enharmonically equivalent notes, such as D and C , in Pythagorean tuning. It is said, that The Pythagorean comma demonstrates that our tonal system is not perfectly consistent but has a gap whose form and cause I will describe in this post. The comma is relevant in terms of both our Pythagorean comma musical practice, since it has very specific effects, and of philosophy and science, since it is typical of the problems that we observe in the interplay of our three worlds (according to Penrose). Thus it is a topic that is not solely relevant to musicians but also to people who are interested in the question as to how mathematics (ideal world), physics (physical world) and our experience (mental world) relate to each other. That is why law, physics and music resonate together.

38 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

application of Miller) vs. The Prime Minister [2019] UKSC 41]. The court having

found that it was not precluded by Parliamentary privilege from considering the

validity of the prorogation itself. The logical approach to that question is to start

at the beginning, with the advice that led to it. That advice was unlawful. It was

outside the powers of the Prime Minister to give it. This means that it was null

and of no effect.... It led to the Order in Council which, being founded on unlawful

advice, was likewise unlawful, null and of no effect and should be quashed. This

led to the actual prorogation, which was as if the Commissioners had walked

into Parliament with a black piece of paper. It too was unlawful, null and of no

effect.

The domino approach exemplified by this case was obviously attractive to

the Supreme Court but it is patently impractical as a general approach to

the questions of Invalidity, it worked in this case and will work in many

other cases. But for the reasons set out above an invalid act must sometime

have legal effect.

[The petitioners have further submitted on the following [on E] too, the relevant

part now being quoted from the 12th Edition of Wade]

E. THE PRESUMPTION OF VALIDITY AND RETROSPECTIVITY

The House of Lords held in 1975 that there is a presumption of validity in

favour of a disputed order until set aside by the court. And this is so even

where temporary obedience to the disputed order would cause irreparable loss

to a party. But their landships have since been held that this presumption was

an evidential matter at the interlocutory stage and involved no sweeping

proposition that subordinate legislation must be treated for all purposes as valid

until set aside. There is no rule that lends validity to invalid acts The

presumption of validity, therefore, is temporary and procedural only, it

39 | C . A . W r i t 2 2 2 2 0 1 8 J u d g e m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 2 n d M a r c h 2 0 2 4

does not determine the validity in law of the disputed act10. [Boddington I

eared]

Moreover, since a void administrative act is, and always has been, non-existent

in law, a finding that an act is void will generally be retrospective. The House of

Lords so held in the case of a prisoner whose release date had been wrongly

calculated so that she remained in prison fifty-nine days longer than she

should have. The prison governor had calculated the date in reliance upon

the law as it was then laid down. But the Court of Appeal later changed the

mode of calculation. The governor could not rely upon either a presumption

of validity or the non-retrospectively of the finding that the detention was

unlawful. The prisoner recovered damages for wrongful imprisonment from

the prison governor. This may seem unfair to the governor who had acted

in good faith and reasonably throughout. But that is because the tort of

wrongful imprisonment is a tort of strict liability, not because the finding

of voidness was retrospective.
