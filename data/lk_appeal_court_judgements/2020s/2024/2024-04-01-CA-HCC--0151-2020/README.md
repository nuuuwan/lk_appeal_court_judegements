The trial commenced before the Judge of the High Court of Colombo as the

Appellant and other Accused had opted for a non-jury trial. After the

conclusion of the prosecutions witnesses, when the case was adjourned to

mark statutory statements of the Appellant and the 2nd Accused, the

Appellant had absconded the Court. Hence, evidence led under 241(1) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 and fixed the case in absentia

of the Appellant. But he was arrested and produced before the defence was

called.

When the defence was called the Appellant remained silent and the 2nd

Accused had made dock statement and had denied the charges. After

considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High Court

Judge had convicted the Appellant for 1st,2nd and 3rd counts and sentenced

him as follows:

First Count 06 months rigorous imprisonment.

Second Count death sentence imposed.

Third Count 02 years rigorous imprisonment.

As no sufficient evidence was led against the 2nd Accused, the Learned High

Court Judge had acquitted him from the case.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

had given consent for this matter to be argued in his absence due to the

Covid 19 pandemic restrictions. Further, at the time of argument the

Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

Background of the Case.

According to PW2, Rupa Matilda, the mother of the deceased, on the date of

the incident, at about 7.00 pm she had gone to fetch water from a public

CA/HCC/0151/20

5

water tap located on the Ginthupitiya Road. When she set off from her home,

she had seen the deceased leaning against a wall close by. The place where

the deceased was illuminated with the light emanating from a church. While

she was filling the water from the tap, had heard her son shouting to save

him. When she ran to the place where the deceased was and she had seen

about six persons surrounding her son and stabbing him mercilessly. She

could not identify any body at that time, but told police that she could

identify if see them again. She had seen the incident with aid of light

emanating from the church and from the street. She had also seen the

assailants stabbing PW1 Indrasiri as well. As she fainted, the deceased had

been taken to the hospital by the neighbors but he died on admission. She

had identified the Appellant at the identification parade.

According to PW1, Indrasiri he was talking to the deceased at the place of

incident. Suddenly about six people had surrounded the deceased and

stabbed him with draggers. He too was stabbed when he tried to rescue the

deceased. Initially he had said that he had identified the Appellant and the

2nd Accused among the crowd. But under cross examination he had said that

he saw only 2nd Accused stabbing the deceased.

PW7, JMO Ajith Jayasena had held the post mortem examination on the

deceased and had noted 27 injuries on the deceaseds body. According to the

JMO, the injury number 18 was fatal and was sufficient to cause instant

death.

PW17, CI/Chandratilaka had arrested the Appellant along with three others

and handed them over to the Pettah Police Station for further investigations.

The Appellant was identified at the identification parade held on 09.11.2004

by PW21 and he was identified by PW2 at the parade. The Appellant was

unrepresented when the identification was held. The identification was held

after about months of the incident.

In respect of the 2nd Accused, an identification was held on 15.06.2005, after

about 14 months of the incident. PW2 had identified the 2nd Accused at the

parade. He too was not represented by an Attorney-a-law at that time.

The Appellant had filed the following grounds of appeal.

1. The judgment pronounced by the Learned High Court Judge is

contrary to law and the judgment entered is not in accordance with

the evidence adduced in this case.

2. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to adequately consider,

assess, and evaluate the evidence led in the case.

3. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to offer due regard to the

doubts raised on the prosecution case.

4. The Appellant has been deprived of a fair trial that is recognized by

Article 13(3) of the Constitution as a result of not assigning a

Counsel for the Appellant.

As the Appeal grounds 1-3 are interconnected, those grounds will be

considered together in this appeal.

The Learned High Court Judge, in her judgment had come to the finding that

the prosecution had not established the identity of the 2nd Accused beyond

reasonable doubt. Hence, he was acquitted from this case.

The Learned High Court Judge in her judgment reasoned out why she

proceeded to acquit the 2nd Accused in following manner:

As the Learned High Court Judge acquitted the 2nd Accused, exclusively due

to poor identification by PW1 and PW2. Now, in this case, the paramount

question needs to be addressed is to consider whether PW2, mother of the

deceased had properly identified the Appellant at the time of committing the

murder.

To obtain a criminal conviction, the burden lies on the prosecution to

demonstrate their case, typically relying on evidence collected by law

enforcement. This evidence may encompass diverse types such as eyewitness

accounts, defendant confessions, mobile phone records, medical records,

and forensic findings.

Accurate identification of a suspect in a criminal proceeding holds significant

weight. Recent years have seen a rise in the scrutiny of the trustworthiness

of identification evidence, particularly that of eyewitness identification.

Courts consistently stress the importance of thoroughly assessing the

circumstances surrounding the identification, including the witness's

opportunity to observe the suspect and the procedures employed during the

CA/HCC/0151/20

8

identification process. Identification parades, commonly used in

investigations, are often regarded as credible evidence in court. Nevertheless,

concerns have been raised regarding the adequacy of safeguards provided to

defendants in cases involving eyewitness identification, prompting scrutiny

of psychological research to evaluate the reliability of identification parades.

In criminal cases, the case of R v Turnbull [1977] QB 224 (CA) provides

that whenever the case against an accused depends wholly or substantially

on the correctness of an identification of the accused that the defence alleges

to be mistaken, the judge should warn the jury of the special need for caution

before convicting the accused in reliance on the correctness of the

identification. The judge should also direct the jury to examine closely the

circumstances in which the identification was made. When the quality of the

identification evidence is good, the jury can be left to assess the value of the

identifying evidence even though there is no other evidence to support it.

However, when the quality of the identified evidence is poor, as for example

when it depends solely on a fleeting glance or on a longer observation made

in difficult conditions, the judge should withdraw the case from the jury and

direct an acquittal unless there is other evidence that goes to support the

correctness of the identification.

In this case, according to PW2, the mother of the deceased, the incident had

taken place in the night and she identified the Appellant and the 2nd Accused

with the aid of street light and the light which was emanating from a church

situated close by.

The relevant portion of the evidence pf PW2 is re-produced below:

Although, PW2 stated that she witnessed the incident with the aid of light

which emanating from a church, in the cross examination she admitted she

identified with a small light fixed to a chapel built on the side of the road.

She also admitted that the place where the incident happened was dark. The

relevant portion is re-produced below:

The above re-produced portions of evidence clearly demonstrate that there

was no proper light condition existed at the time of happening the incident.

PW13, CI/Ovitigama the investigating officer in this case had gone to the

crime scene immediately after receiving the first complaint about the incident

at about 7.30pm. Although the eyewitness PW2 stated that she witnessed

CA/HCC/0151/20

11

the incident with the aid of light emanating from a church and with street

light, the examination-in-chief and the cross examination on behalf of the

Appellant of the investigating officer does not contain a single mention about

the light condition nor the existence of a church and street light.

Analysing the crime scene is a vital stage in all investigations. To effectively

decipher the information conveyed by material evidence, it is essential to

conduct a thorough examination of the crime scene, identifying and

collecting traces in a systematic manner.

In this case, identification evidence of PW2 is very important as the

prosecution case solely rests on the correct identification of the perpetrator.

Although, PW2 stated that she identified the Appellant with the aid of a small

light of a chapel, in her evidence, she admitted that the place of incident was

dark.

PW13, the investigating officer who went to the place of incident immediately

after the incident had fail to mention the light condition of the place incident.

This is very serious lacuna in the prosecutions case, as the identification of

the Appellant solely rest on the light condition that existed at that time.

Further, PW2 had taken two different stances with regard to the light

condition that existed at time of the incident.

Further, the Learned High Court Judge had acquitted the 2nd Accused

disbelieving the identification evidence of PW2 who had identified him at the

CA/HCC/0151/20

12

identification parade. This benefit of doubt was not awarded to the Appellant

in this case.

In SC (SPL) Appeal 07/2018 decided on 04.10.2019, His Lordship Jayantha

Jayasuriya, PC, CJ stated that:

Facts leading to assess the quality of evidence of visual identification

are important facts a court needs to take into account in deciding on the

identity of an accused. What matters is the quality of the evidence. In

such situations the evidence of the witness should demonstrate that

there was sufficient opportunity for the witness to have seen the person

concerned at the time of the incident and thereafter had the ability to

identify the person concerned during his testimony in court.

Factors such as, the duration of the interaction between the witness and

the suspect, distance between them, the nature of light under which

the witness observed, whether there are any special reasons to

remember the suspect such as presence of unique physical features,

existence of any factors impeding the opportunity for clear and

uninterrupted observation, whether the witness had seen the suspect

before and if so the number of occasions and whether the suspect was

known by name or not, are relevant to determine the quality of visual

identification evidence. Dayananda Lokugalappaththi and eight others

v The State, [2003] 3 SLR 362 at 390, R v Turnbull (C.A.), [1977] 1 Q.B.

224 at 228. This list of factors is not exhaustive, but could vary

according to the facts and circumstances of each case. [Empasis added]

In this case, the prosecution has not sufficiently established the visual

identification of the Appellant beyond reasonable doubt by. The Learned High

Court Judge had failed to evaluate this point which, no doubt, favours the

Appellant. Hence, is deprived of a fair trial which is guaranteed in the

Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

CA/HCC/0151/20

As the prosecution had failed in its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 06/10/2020 on the Appellant. Therefore, he

is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
