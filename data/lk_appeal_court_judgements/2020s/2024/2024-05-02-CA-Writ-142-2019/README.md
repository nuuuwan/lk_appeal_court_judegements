RESPONDENTS

7

made an Application dated 30.07.2018 (1R1) under the Coast Conservation and Coastal

Resources Management Act, No. 57 of 1981 (as amended) (the Act) seeking a permit to

start the said shrimp farm project. In pursuant to that application, the Director General of

the Department of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management, the 1st

Respondent took steps to hold a meeting to discuss the matter with the relevant

parties/authorities, namely, the Pradeshiya Sabha of Pesalai in Mannar, Divisional

Secretariat Mannar, Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Department of

Wildlife Conservation, National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency,

National Aquatic Development Authority and the Central Environmental Authority

(1R2/1R3). Accordingly, a meeting was held at the Coast Conservation and Coastal

Resource Management Department (the CC&CRMD) on 13.08.2018 (1R3) and

considering the possible environmental and socio-economic impacts due to the proposed

shrimp farm project the CC&CRMD took a final decision to carry out an Initial

Environmental Examination (the IEE) to consider granting approval to the said shrimp

farm project. The CC&CRMD by the letter dated 29.08.2018 marked as R17 requested the

12th Respondent to submit an IEE Report (IEER) for the proposed shrimp farm project

addressing all matters referred to in the Terms of Reference (TOR) (marked as R17A)

attached to the said letter for it to be reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Committee (the

TEC). Thereafter, the 12th Respondent submitted the IEER marked as P21. At the meeting

held on 12.10.2018 at the CC&CRMD, a decision was taken by the TEC to conduct a joint

field inspection after considering and evaluating the IEER (1R5). Thereafter, a joint field

inspection was carried out on 22.10.2018 (1R6(a) to 1R6(e)) with the participation of the

officials of the relevant authorities (1R6(f) to 1R6(g)). Thereafter, by the letter dated

8

26.10.2018 marked as 1R7, the CC&CRMD called for comments on the project from the

relevant authorities. The Central Environmental Authority (the CEA) (1R8(a)), National

Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (1R8(b)), Department of Wildlife

Conservation (1R8(c)) and the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment

(1R8(d)) submitted their comments/observations/recommendations.

By 1R8(a), the CEA informed, inter alia, that it requires a classification whether an Import

Risk Analysis has been done for the importation of Vannamei species which the 12th

Respondent wanted to have in the shrimp farm and in pursuant to which the CC&CRMD

by the letter marked as 1R9(a) called for recommendations of the National Aquatic

Development Authority regarding the impacts of introducing Vannamei shrimp. The

National Aquatic Development Authority responded to 1R9(a) by a letter dated 07.11.2018

(1R9(c)) stating that an Import Risk Assessment was conducted and the Report (1R9(b))

has already been sent to the CC&CRMD. By the letter dated 12.07.2018 marked as R7, the

National Aquaculture Development Authority, the 8th Respondent informed the Director

General of the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (the 5th Respondent), that

the 8th Respondent had granted the approval to the 12th Respondent to operate Specific

Pathogen Free Vannamei (SPF Vannamei) hatchery. By the letter marked as 1R8(c)/R4A,

the Department of Wildlife Conservation informed the 1st Respondent that it has no

objection to the operation of the shrimp farm project subject to the terms and conditions

stipulated in that letter and by letter marked as 1R8(d) the Ministry of Mahaweli

Development and Environment after considering the IEE granted approval for the project

subject to fulfilling the terms and conditions stipulated therein.

9

Thereafter, the Department of Animal Production and Health issued a letter dated

16.07.2018 marked as 1R10(a) stating that subject to the conditions mentioned in that letter

the 12th Respondent could be allowed to import Penaeus Vannamei live shrimp from

Hawaii USA. A permit dated 09.01.2019 marked as P22/1R11/R4 valid from 09.01.2019

to 08.01.2020 was issued to the 12th Respondent for the shrimp farm project in terms of

Section 14 of the Act stipulating the conditions. The Aquaculture Management Licences

valid from 08.04.2018 to 29.02.2020 (1R12(a) and (1R12(b)) were issued by the National

Aquaculture Development Authority to commence and continue the operational activities

of the Vannamei shrimp farm. By the letter dated 03.01.2018 (1R13(c)), the National

Aquatic Development Authority informed the Director General of the Department of

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources that it has granted the approval for the operation of the

Vannamei shrimp hatchery to the 12th Respondent. The Department of Fisheries and

Aquatic Resources issued permits dated 14.07.2018 and 16.01.2018 marked as

1R13(a)/R9A and 1R13(b)/R9 respectively to the 12th Respondent for the importation of

Vannamei shrimp. A letter marked as 1R17 was issued by the National Aquaculture

Development Authority confirming that the samples tested were in conformity with the

requirements of the National Aquaculture Development Authority. According to the

documents marked as 1R13(d) to 1R13(f), the importations had been done after conducting

necessary investigations by the Veterinary Research Institution. When considering all the

above-stated facts and circumstances the Court can be satisfied that the 12th Respondent

has commenced and continued the operation of the shrimp farm after obtaining the

necessary approvals/permits.

10

The Petitioners allege that the said shrimp farm has been built clearing mangroves which

have a direct ecological and livelihood impact on the fishermen of the coastal areas of

Erukkalampiddy. The position of the Petitioners is that the livelihood of the local

community in Erukkalampiddy is primarily based on traditional fishing and the mangroves

provide numerous benefits to the local community in Erukkalampiddy while protecting

against storm surges and coastal erosions. Moreover, the introduction of Vannamei shrimp

which is non-native would cause severe damage to the native fish, prawns and other sea

creatures and the ecosystem if the shrimp from the project escape/leak into the

Erukkalampiddy lagoon. The Petitioners allege that the shrimp farm has been constructed

in the coastal zone which is protected under the Act and the IEER is incorrect, inaccurate

and biased toward the 12th Respondent. The Petitioners further allege that the 12th

Respondent has not obtained a permit from the Director General of Wild Life under Section

37(1) of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance, No. 02 of 1937 (as amended) for the

importation of shrimp and illegally, without a permit has constructed the shrimp farm and

commenced operations. The Petitioners further allege that the construction of the shrimp

farm and importation of the Vannamei shrimp has been done without the necessary

approval and/or permits.

The position of the Petitioners is that the IEER does not satisfy the Sri Lanka Coastal Zone

and Coastal Resource Management Plan - 2018 prepared in terms of Section 12(1) of the

Act published in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 2072/58 dated 25.05.2018 (P23) and

therefore a permit under Section 14 of the Act could not have issued acting upon such

IEER. The Petitioners allege that when considering the possible environmental impacts of

the shrimp farm project, an IEER is not sufficient to determine whether a permit should be

11

issued under Section 14 for the reason that the public had no opportunity to comment on

the contents of the IEER and therefore the permit marked as P22 has been issued in

violation of natural justice. The position of the Petitioners is that the public could have

raised their concerns only if an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was called and

whether to issue a permit for the project could have decided only upon calling an EIA.

Under the above-stated circumstances, the Petitioners argue that the permit marked as P22

is illegal and ultra vires the provisions of the Act. Therefore, invoking the Writ jurisdiction

of this Court the Petitioners seek the following substantial reliefs, inter alia,

(c) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the Permit

marked P22 issued to the 12th Respondent for the shrimp farm project;

(d) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st

Respondent to take steps/action in terms of the Coast Conservation and Coastal

Resource Management Act, 57 of 1981(as amended) and/or other applicable laws, to

remove the 12th Respondent's said shrimp farm project and restore the

land/premises/Coastal Zone and the environment in the area affected by the 12th

Respondent's Project to its original/ natural condition;

(e) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus on the 2nd Respondent

directing to take steps/action under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance No. 02

of 1937 (as amended) against the 12th Respondent in respect of importing non-

indigenous species "SPF Vannamei Shrimp" and/or "P. vannamei shrimp" into Sri

Lanka without a permit issued by the 2nd Respondent under Section 37(1) of the Fauna

and Protection Ordinance No. 02 of 1937 (as amended) and remove the said species,

namely, "SPF Vannamei Shrimp" and/or "P. vannamei shrimp" and restore the Coastal

12

Zone and the environment in the area affected by the 12th Respondent's Project to its

original/ natural condition;

(f) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition on the 1st Respondent

prohibiting from extending/renewing the permit marked P22 issued to the 12th

Respondent's for the said shrimp farm project introducing SPF Vannamei Shrimp

and/or P. vannamei shrimp;

(g) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition on the 2nd Respondent

prohibiting from issuing a permit to the 12th Respondent under Section 37(1) of the

Fauna and Protection Ordinance No. 02 of 1937 (as amended) to import the non-

indigenous species "SPF Vannamei Shrimp" and/or "P. vannamei shrimp" into Sri

Lanka;

(h) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition on the 3rd Respondent

prohibiting from permitting the 12th Respondent to import "SPF Vannamei Shrimp"

and/or "P. vannamei shrimp" into Sri Lanka.

The Petitioners allege that the 12th Respondent has imported two shipments of Vannamei

shrimp without obtaining a permit under Section 37(1) of the Fauna and Flora Ordinance.

The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the 12th Respondent argues that it is not

required to obtain a permit under the Fauna and Flora Ordinance as the permit for the

importation of the shrimp was obtained from the Director General of the Department of

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (the 5th Respondent) under the powers vested with him by

the Gazette No. 1036/13 dated 16.06.1998 marked as R8. In terms of the Gazette marked

as R8, without obtaining a permit from the Director of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources,

13

no person could import or export any live egg, roe or spawn of any fish and such permits

should be issued in Form F set out in Part IV of the Schedule to the Gazette. In the instant

Application, the permits for the importation of live fish marked as 1R13(a)/R9A and

1R13(b)/R9 had been issued to the 12th Respondent by the 5th Respondent. Therefore, I am

of the view that the necessity does not arise for obtaining a permit under the Fauna and

Flora Ordinance since the approvals/permits for importation have already been granted by

the relevant Authority.

Another allegation made by the Petitioners is that the necessary approvals and/or permits

have not been obtained for the construction of the shrimp farm and importation of the

Vannamei shrimp. In terms of the letter marked as 1R9(c), the Minister of Fisheries and

Aquatic Resources Development has taken a policy decision on 30.09.2011 to introduce

Litopenaeus Vannamei to Sri Lanka except for the North Western province and the shrimp

farm project in question has been approved at the Investment Facilitation, Steering

Committee meeting held on 16.02.2017. In terms of the letter marked as 1R13(c), the

Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development has granted approval for the

implementation of the project and the National Aquaculture Development Authority has

granted approval for the 12th Respondent to operate a SPF Vannamei hatchery. After

consulting/obtaining approval of the relevant authorities, in terms of Section 14 of the Act

a permit for the development activity marked as P22, Aquaculture Management Licences

marked as 1R12(a) and (1R12(b)) and permits for importation of Vannamei shrimp marked

as 1R13(a)/R9A and 1R13(b)/R9 were issued to the 12th Respondent by the CC&CRMD,

the National Aquaculture Development Authority and the Department of Fisheries and

Aquatic Resources respectively. Considering the above-stated facts, this Court sees no

14

merit in the argument of the Petitioners that necessary approvals and/or permits have not

been obtained in relation to the shrimp farm project.

Now I will address my mind to the Petitioners argument that the permit marked as P22 is

illegal and ultra vires the provisions of the Act. The Petitioners argue that the IEE is not

sufficient to grant the permit and considering the adverse environmental impacts of the

project an EIA which the public could raise their concerns should have been carried out

instead of an IEE. In terms of Section 16 of the Act, when an Application is made to obtain

a development permit under the Act, the Director General of the Department of Coast

Conservation and Coastal Resources Management has the power to decide either to carry

out an IEE or an EIA or both such reports. Section 16(1) of the Act reads thus,

Upon receipt of an application for a permit to engage in a development activity within

the Coastal Zone as required by subsection (3) of section 14, the Director-General may

require the applicant to furnish an initial environmental examination report or an

environmental impact assessment report relating to the development activity as the case

may be, or both such reports. It shall be the duty of the applicant to comply with such

requirement. Every initial environmental examination report or environmental impact

assessment report shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed.

In terms of Section 16(1) of the Act, it is clear that the Director General of the Department

of Coast Conservation and Coastal Resources Management has the discretion either to call

an IEE or EIA or both such reports. Moreover, in terms of Section 16(2C) of the Act only

if the Director-General considers that an EIA report is necessary to arrive at a decision after

considering an IEER submitted to him under Section 16(2A), then he may require the

applicant to submit an EIA report. Therefore, it is clear that it is the 1st Respondent who

15

has the power to decide whether to call for an IEE or EIA or both such reports and if he

decides to call for an IEE and decides that the IEE is not sufficient to arrive at a decision,

he has the power to call for an EIA. The Petitioners argue that the 1st Respondent should

have called an EIA for the reason that if an EIA was called only the public could express

their views and raise concerns regarding the project. The decision to call for an IEE has

been taken by the 1st Respondent acting under the powers vested on him under the Act and

this Court has no expertise to decide whether the IEE is sufficient or whether he should

have called an EIA in deciding to issue the permit. This Court in the case of Environmental

Foundation Limited Vs. Central Environmental Authority,1 held that;

This court would not substitute its discretion for that of the expert but would interfere

with its exercise if it is sought to be exercised in an arbitrary manner or in matters

outside the limits of the discretionary authority conferred by the legislature or on

considerations extraneous to those laid down by the legislature. Thus, this court

cannot issue a writ of mandamus directing the first respondent to call for an EIAR in

respect of the said project. The discretion to call for an EIAR or IEER has to be

exercised by the first respondent and by the first respondent only. Any clear departure

from the objects of the statute is objectionable and renders the act invalid in law

In Nirmal Anrudha Madanayaka and Others Vs. Director General, Department of Coast

Conservation and Coastal Resources Management and Others2, where the Petitioners, in

that case, have taken up an argument similar to the case at hand, citing Environmental

1 (2006) 3 SLR 57. 2 CA (Writ) Application No. 54/2021, CA Minutes dated 27.04.2021.

16

Foundation Limited Vs. Central Environmental Authority (supra) Arjuna Obeyesekere, J.

(P/CA) held that;

Thus, it is mandatory that either an IEE or an EIA must be carried out. Once an IEE

is carried out, the decision whether an EIA should also be carried out depends on the

contents of the IEE Report. In this regard, it is important to note that it is the 1st

Respondent who prepared the TOR to be followed by the Project Proponent, and that

it is the 1st Respondent who is in the best position to decide if an IEE is sufficient.

In the Application at hand, I am of the view that the 1st Respondent has not exercised the

discretion vested upon him under Section 16(1) of the Act in an arbitrary manner or outside

the limits of the discretionary authority conferred to him by the Act.

The Petitioners further argue that the IEER does not satisfy the Sri Lanka Coastal Zone and

Coastal Resource Management Plan - 2018 marked as P23 and therefore a permit under

Section 14 of the Act should not have been issued upon such IEER. In response, the learned

Presidents Counsel appearing for the 12th Respondent submitted that as per the letter

marked as R17, the 1st Respondent has requested the 12th Respondent to submit an IEER

in terms of the TOR marked as R17A and accordingly the 12th Respondent had prepared

the IEE and submitted the IEER. When taking into consideration the TOR marked as R17

and the IEER marked as P21, this Court observes that the IEER submitted by the 12th

Respondent is in conformity with the TOR marked as R17. Moreover, it is also observed

that the TOR marked as R17 corresponds with the general guidelines for the preparation of

the IEE set out in Paragraph 6.6.3 in the Sri Lanka Coastal Zone and Coastal Resource

Management Plan - 2018 marked as P23. Therefore, this Court cannot agree with the

contention of the Petitioners that the IEER does not satisfy the Sri Lanka Coastal Zone and

17

Coastal Resource Management Plan - 2018. Considering the above-stated facts and

authorities this Court is of the view that the permit marked as P22 is neither illegal nor

ultra vires the provisions of the Act.

The learned SC appearing for the 1st to 11th and 15th Respondents brought the attention of

this Court to the fact that the permit marked as P22 has been issued for the period from

09.01.2019 to 08.01.2020 for the purpose of granting the approval to commence the

development activity within the coastal zone. In terms of Section 14 of the Act, the

applicant must complete the development within the period stipulated in the permit and if

the permit holder is unable to complete the development activity within such period, he

should make an application to renew the permit. After issuance of the permit marked as

P22, the construction work of the shrimp farm has been completed and by now the 12th

Respondent is exporting the harvest of the shrimp farm. The permit that the Petitioners

seek to quash has already lapsed after the expiration of the duration of the period mentioned

in the permit and therefore the relief prayed for in prayer (c) to issue a Writ of Certiorari to

quash the permit marked as P22 has now become futile. Dr. Sunil Coorey in Principles of

Administrative Law in Sri Lanka (4th Edn,) at page 1172 has stated that,

Certiorari will not be issued to quash a particular exercise of power if it be futile to

do so because it is no more operational or it has had its effect.

In the case of Ratnasiri and others Vs Ellawala and others3 Marsoof, PC. J (P/CA) (as he

then was) held that;

3 (2004) SLR 180.

18

"This court is mindful of the fact that the prerogative remedies it is empowered to

grant in these proceedings are not available as of right. Court has a discretion in

regard to the grant of relief in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction. It has been

held time and time again by our Courts that "A writ... will not issue where it would

be vexatious or futile."

Considering all the above-stated facts, this Court is of the view that the Petitioners are not

entitled to the reliefs prayed for in the Petition. Therefore, this Court dismisses this Writ

Application. No costs ordered.

Application dismissed.
