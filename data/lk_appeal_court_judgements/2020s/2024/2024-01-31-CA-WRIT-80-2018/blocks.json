    "text": "8 As this Court has taken the liberty of referring to the highly advanced Sinhalese Literature, nourished by those of Pali and Sanskrit, it is apt to quote from an article of Prof. Balram K. Gupta, Senior Advocate, Director (Academic) Chandigarh Judicial Academy. Former Director, National Judicial Academy, Bhopal, published in the Judges Journal, Vol. VI, December 2020 (available at the website of the Judges Training Institute of Sri Lanka) under the Title Blending Law with Literature, where he says, H.M. Seervai was a Constitutional Law scholar of the highest academic distinction. He was offered judgeship of the Supreme Court of India twice. He did not accept it. He thought, he would be able to make his lasting contribution in shaping the Indian constitution through the medium of his book on Constitutional Law. Indeed, he did. His love for literature was so deep. He blended the two together. It was in 1973. First trip out of India. To U.K.. He was at the Pitts Cottage. Some lines were inscribed over the fire place. To the amazement of every one, he said: Oh Scott -- But what a pity, the next few lines were not inscribed. He recited the lines: Now is the stately column broke; The beacon light is quenched in smoke He completed the last stanza. He was asked, are you a Professor of literature at Oxford or Cambridge? He laughed and said, no! I am a lawyer from India. Still another one. 4th July, U.S Independence day Celebrations at U.S Consulate in Bombay. The Vice Consul was amazed. Seervai rattled off Abraham Lincolns Gettysburg as also the second Inaugural Address. He was fond of literature. He knew hundreds of poems. He could recite them with body, mind and soul. Shakespeare was part of his vocabulary. He knew the great lines in different plays by heart. A rare mix of law and literature. Ladies and Gentleman; it is allowed.",

    "text": "2011. Retrieved 14 January 2011. 20 Kandy was originally known as Senkadagala pura after a hermit named Senkada who lived there. The royal palace in Senkadagala was built by King Vikramabahu the 3rd of Gampola on the advice of a Brahmin who selected the site as a lucky ground for a Capital city. (The Legend is that the Brahmin saw, somewhere close to the Bo Tree in the Dharmaraja Primary School premises (belonging to Natha Devale, Kandy) a hair being chased by a jackal. At the Bo Tree the hair turned back and faced the jackal and (undoubtedly because of the shock and surprise caused by this unexpected gesture) the jackal started to run. [This sometimes happen, when the hunted, in sheer desperation, summons all its courage and confront the hunter] The first king to ascended the throne of Senkadagala was Sena Sammata Wickramabahu. [Perhaps the Christian missionaries being confronted by the underprivileged is a story similar to the above, of the Jackal and the hair] The information in this footnote except about the legend and those within parentheses taken from https://mysrilanka.com/travel/lanka/history/senkadagala_era.htm#:~:text=Kandy%20was%20originally%20known%20as%20Senkadagala%20pura%20after,derived%20from%20the%20Word%20Kanda%2C%20which%20means%20mountain.",

The sonorous speech, that received enthusiastic applaud in the lofty hall of the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, continues to ring louder in the hearts of many people, with the eternity of the truth phrased in Hatred ceases not by hatred, but by love, which was ennobled in the sacred scripture of Dhammapada. With this sacred teaching by the lord Buddha, the Great Teacher, in mind, His Excellency Jayewardene expressed strong support for a free and independent Japan and renounced reparation claims. Thus, His Excellency Jayewardene most effectively solidified the tone of the Peace Conference.

    "text": "40 Some of the synonyms of this word are generosity, benevolence, liberality, humanity, nobility, chivalry, altruism and unselfishness. 41 Einstein compared knowledge to a marble statue standing in the desert, continually threatened by shifting sands. Just as hands must keep the marble shining in the sun, education requires ceaseless effort to maintain and renew knowledge. Whereas centric refers to a circle, eccentric refers to an ellipse. It is the latter that looks at a new direction, making discoveries on its way, but never losing the reference to the center. It is said, Eccentrics, those delightful outliers, whose minds dance to tunes of cosmic jest, they waltz with quarks and tango with quasars, in their peculiar orbits, they find zest For in their eccentric orbits, they invent, new constellations, stories, and art, they defy gravity, norms, and dissent and stitch the fabric of existence with heart. So yes, my friend, it is the eccentrics who steer, the ship of progress, charting uncharted seas, their kaleidoscope minds, both far and near, paint the canvas of tomorrow with vibrant esprit. Among some of the famous eccentrics given are Salvador Dali (Painter, Melting Clocks), Nikola Tesla (Serbian American inventor, wireless energy transmission), Albert Einstein (physicist, space time) and Isadora Duncan (barefoot dancer who flouted conventions). [Science in perfect harmony with Art] In Why we need eccentricity Martin Howard says, In 1859, the anti-slavery campaigner, women's rights advocate and Liberal MP John Stuart Mill wrote in On Liberty, \"That so few now dare to be eccentric, marks the chief danger of the time.\" A man who hated any kind of tyranny, Mill particularly despised the sneering, curtain-twitching, self-elected arbiters of social conformity. For him, they were tyrants responsible for \"enslaving the soul.\" Instead, Mill saw eccentric behaviour so long as it harmed no-one as not only a matter of personal freedom, but a boon to society - https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/01/eccentricity-einstein-prince-society",
