This is an appeal by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence by the learned High

Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Kuliyapitiya, for committing

house trespass by night into the house of the female mentioned in the indictment

of Kuliyapitiya and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of section

433 of the Penal Code.

He was also indicted for committing the offence of rape on the same female

mentioned earlier, at the same time and at the same transaction, and thereby

committing an offence punishable in terms of section 364(1) as amended by

Amendment Act No.22 of 1995 of the Penal Code.

Page 3 of 15

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya of his

judgment dated 02-10-2019, found the appellant guilty for both the counts

preferred against him.

Hearing the mitigatory, as well as the aggravating circumstances, the learned

High Court Judge sentenced the appellant for 3 months simple imprisonment

for count 01, and he was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.100/-, with a default

sentence of one-month simple imprisonment.

In relation to count 02, the appellant was sentenced for a period of 15 years

rigorous imprisonment and was ordered to pay a fine of Rs.25,000/-, with a

default sentence of six months simple imprisonment.

In addition to the above sentence, he was ordered to pay Rs.250,000/- as

compensation to the victim of this incident, namely PW-01. He was ordered to

serve two years simple imprisonment in default.

After having considered his previous conviction record, and acting in terms of

section 5(1) of the Prevention of Crimes Ordinance, the learned High Court Judge

has ordered the appellant to be under police supervision for a period of 4 years

after he is released from the prison.

The facts in brief

The prosecutrix (PW-01) was alone in her house when this incident occurred.

Her husband has passed away sometime before this incident and of her two sons,

eldest son has been working overseas. The younger son has returned a week

prior to this incident from an overseas job. This incident has occurred on 30-07-

2012 around 12-12.30 in the night.

On that day, her son has gone to attend a funeral. While she was in sleep,

somebody has come and wanted her to open the door. The person has identified

himself as Sohone Kade Ajith. When she looked outside from the window, she

has seen a person sitting on a motorbike parked on the road and the other person

whom she identified as Ajith calling her to open the door.

Page 4 of 15

In this process, he has threatened to smash the house if she did not open the

door. When she refused, he has come around the house to the back door and

had kicked the door. Since it was an old door, which had no lock but a wooden

cross-bar placed across it, the door had got opened when it was kicked.

The appellant whom she identified as Ajith has entered the house from the back

door and has held the prosecutrix by her neck and forced her to go into a room

of the house. It was her evidence that after forcing her onto the bed in the room,

he lifted her nightdress, partially removed his trouser and had forcible sexual

intercourse with her. She has stated that the incident lasted for about one and

half hours. It appears from the line of examination by the Prosecuting State

Counsel that, several questions have been put to the prosecutrix on the basis

that the incident lasted for about one and half hours.

The Prosecuting State Counsel has put another question asking her whether she

felt some smell when she was raped, for which she has replied that she cannot

say, but there was a cigarette smell.

The witness has stated that the appellant closed her mouth with his hand which

prevented her from shouting, but ultimately she was able to shout because of

the pain she suffered.

After committing the act of forcible intercourse with her, the appellant has left,

stating, although he is leaving now, he is going to come back.

Thereafter, through fear, the prosecutrix has gone to the house of her neighbour

who lived about 15 feet away from her house and stayed with the female who

occupied that house until her son returned. After going there, she has not

directly divulged the rape incident to her, but has stated Ajith, meaning the

appellant, forced her into the house and she feels pain and let her sleep in the

house. She has explained as to why she did not divulge the incident of rape to

her neighbor stating that she feared if she divulged it, she may not be allowed to

stay in that house.

Page 5 of 15

After about 15 minutes of going into the house of the neighbour, her son has

returned and called for her. Thereafter, she has gone to her house and had

informed the son of the rape committed on her by the appellant.

The son had got down a motorbike from a friend and had taken her to the

Katupotha police, and from there, she has been admitted to Kuliyapitiya

hospital, where she has been examined by a doctor.

Under cross-examination, she has admitted that she was in the habit of selling

liquor in her house to earn a living after the death of her husband. She has

stated that, she knew the appellant before, and although the appellant has not

come to her house previously, he came in front of her house one day and inquired

whether the person called Chandana who supplies liquor to her to sell was

present and left.

She has denied that she told in the police statement that the appellant was a

person known to her and had talked to her previously. This has been marked

as a contradiction marked V-01. She has been specific that the other person she

saw did not come to her house. She has also stated that she feared for her life

and that is why she could not resist the appellant when he committed rape on

her. However, she has stated, that from the moment the appellant forced her

onto the bed she pleaded with him to let her go, pleading that she may die. It

had been her stand that the appellant did not let her go, but forcibly committed

rape on her.

It appears that the learned Counsel who represented the appellant at the trial

had questioned the prosecutrix on the basis that the incident went on for one

and half hours.

The witness has stated that before she went to the neighbours house, she

washed her vaginal area. She has not disputed what she told the police in her

statement was that, her son came while she was crying and waiting in the living

area of her house around 2.00 p.m. in that night. It has been her position that

Page 6 of 15

she knew nothing about a cigarette packet, but her son told her that he found a

cigarette packet inside the house.

It has been suggested to her that, she is lying and she had sexual intercourse

with the appellant with the consent for over one and half hours, and it was only

after her son came and questioned her about the cigarette packet found in the

house, she concocted an incident of rape falsely against the appellant.

She has denied that she had consensual sex with the appellant, stating that her

husband died 16 years ago and she has never done such a thing after her

husbands death. She has also denied that she went to the police and

complained, only because her son and his friend Chandana forced her to do so,

stating that she complained because of what happened to her.

The neighbour to whose house the prosecutrix has gone after the incident, has

given evidence at the trial. She has stated that while she was sleeping, around

12.00 in the night, the prosecutrix came running into her house, she appeared

to be scared of something, and informed her that, Ajith squeezed her neck. She

had wanted her to be allowed to sleep in the house. About 15 minutes afterwards,

her son had come and accompanied the prosecutrix to her house.

According the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) who examined the

victim, although he has not observed any injuries on her, he has observed

tenderness in her neck and lower abdominal area, which means, she has

expressed pain when touching the above areas. The JMO has not observed any

injuries on her vaginal area and has expressed the opinion that because she was

a married woman, such injuries cannot be expected.

The short history given to the JMO by the prosecutrix was consistent with her

version of events as narrated in her evidence before the Court. The JMO has

expressed the opinion that although there were no injuries to her vagina, he

cannot exclude vaginal penetration due to the reasons mentioned earlier.

Page 7 of 15

The son of the prosecutrix who came home after the incident has stated that

after going to a funeral house where he waited for 2-3 hours, he returned home

around 12 midnight. While in the funeral house, he has come to know about an

incident similar to the incident faced by the prosecutrix, which has been told to

him be a person who came to the funeral house accompanied by the appellant.

He has never imagined that it had happened to his mother. When he returned

home, his mother had not been at home and when he called for her, she has

come from the next-door neighbours house and has informed that the appellant

held her by the neck and committed rape on her. Since she was in pain, he has

taken steps to borrow a motorbike from his friend and admit her to Kuliyapitiya

hospital. He had come to know that his mother has given a statement to the

police thereafter.

He has admitted that he returned to the country few days before this incident

after working overseas, and his mother used to sell liquor obtained from one

Chandana, at her house.

He has stated that, while at the funeral house he heard the appellant inquiring

from Kakkana, with whom he came to the funeral house, about a packet of

cigarettes. He has overheard the said Kakkana saying that, it was given to you

and should be with you. After returning home, he has seen a cigarette packet on

the doorframe and had asked his mother about that.

Under cross-examination, he has denied that what he said in his police

statement was that, when he came home, the mother was seated in the living

area of the house and was crying. That contradiction has been marked as V-03.

The police officer who had conducted an investigation into this matter had

observed that the back door of the house could be opened in the manner stated

by the prosecutrix in her evidence.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case and when the appellant was called

upon for his defence, he has decided to make a statement from the dock.

Page 8 of 15

He has claimed that the prosecutrix had an illicit affair with him over a long

period of time and after her son returned from overseas, he had come to know

about the affair he had with prosecutrix. It had been his position that it was the

son who had taken her to the police station and made a complaint against him

of a rape. He has claimed that he never raped her, but everything happened with

her consent.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing for this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel urged the

following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. The prosecution had not proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

2. Matters favorable to the accused pertaining to his defence have not

been taken into consideration by the learned High Court Judge.

3. The dock statement of the accused has not been properly evaluated by

the learned High Court Judge.

The Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

Since the urged grounds of appeal are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider

the said grounds of appeal together.

The learned Presidents Counsel relied heavily on the evidence where the

prosecutrix has stated that this incident went on for about one and half hours,

to argue that such an incident cannot take place for such a long period if there

was no consent on the part of the prosecutrix. He was of the view that, when

taken together with the dock statement of the appellant where he has stated that

everything happened with consent, an invariable doubt arises as to the version

of events as stated by the prosecutrix.

It is quite obvious from the evidence of the prosecutrix, she has stated that the

incident went on for about one and half hours, not by looking at a clock or having

known about a specific time, but because it happened over a period of time which

she thought that took about one and half hours.

Page 9 of 15

It should be understood that for a female who faces an unexpected situation of

this kind, while alone in her own home, in the dead of the night, even 5 minutes

may feel like a long period. I am of the view that, one and half hours mentioned

by the prosecutrix does not mean that it actually happened over such a period,

but it was how she has explained the situation faced by her.

Although the learned Presidents Counsel invited the Court to consider this

aspect together with the dock statement of the appellant, arguing that it creates

a doubt, I have no basis to agree.

The stand taken up by the appellant, had not been an admission that he engaged

in sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix on the night where it has been alleged

that he raped her. His defence has been that he had an affair with the prosecutrix

over a long period of time and when her son came to know about it, it was he

who took the prosecutrix to the police and made a complaint of rape.

Another point raised by the learned Presidents Counsel to argue that there is a

doubt about the truthfulness of the incident, was the cigarette packet found by

the son of the prosecutrix at her house. It was argued that because prosecutrix

could not give an explanation to him for the cigarette packet found in the house

by the son, a false allegation of rape was made against the appellant.

However, the evidence clearly shows that, when the appellant came into the

house, he was in the company of another person who did not come into the

house but waited outside on the motorbike which they came. The victim has

stated that when the rape was committed on her, she felt a cigarette smell

emanating from the appellant.

There is nothing to suggest that the cigarette packet was found by the son before

he took his mother to the hospital.

When taken as a whole, the only inference that can be drawn is that the son has

found it later after he took his mother to the hospital. This shows that there was

Page 10 of 15

no opportunity to concoct a story against the appellant because of the discovery

of the cigarette packet.

It was also argued that in the light of the consent defence taken up by the

appellant, the reasons for the prosecutrix to not open the door when the

appellant tried to come into the house could be explained, contending that she

may not have opened the door as there was another person outside of the house.

The evidence of the prosecutrix had been that, she refused to open the door but

the appellant came to the back door and forcibly opened it. She has stated that

when the appellant kicked the door, the cross bar of the door fell off and it got

opened. The evidence of the investigating officer had been to the effect that, the

back door of the house can be opened from outside by removing the cross bar

through a gap of the door, which sufficiently corroborates the evidence of the

prosecutrix, that it was the appellant who forced open the door.

I am not in a position to agree that these pieces of evidence could have been

considered in favor of the appellant, whereas, there was no basis to consider

them in such a manner.

The victim has well explained as to why she did not tell her next-door neighbour

that the appellant committed rape on her, when she went to her house after the

incident. She has explained stating that she thought if she divulges the incident

of rape, her neighbor would get scared, and she may not allow her to stay in the

house, which in my view is a plausible reasoning under the circumstances she

would have been facing at that time.

Her neighbour has given evidence in this case and has confirmed that when the

prosecutrix came running to her house at that night, she looked scared, and

requested her to allow her to stay with her.

The only discrepancy that needs consideration of the evidence is the

contradiction in relation to where the prosecutrix was, when her son came home

on that day.

Page 11 of 15

Although the prosecutrix as well as her son has stated that, when he came, the

prosecutrix was in the house of their neighbor and she came home after the son

called for her, it appears that in their police statements, what they have stated

had been that when the son came, she was in her own house seated in the living

area and crying. However, when considering the evidence of the neighbour who

has no reason to utter an untruth, it is clear that the prosecutrix has gone to

her house after the incident and had waited until her son came home.

Although, what had been stated to the police by the prosecutrix and her son was

somewhat different to that, I am unable to conclude that as a major contradiction

which goes into the core of the evidence when considering that fact together with

the evidence of the neighbor.

It is well settled law that, no witness can be expected to have a photographic

memory of what happened in a given scenario. I am of the view that, especially,

in an incident of rape of this nature, some discrepancies should be expected,

and should not be considered relevant, unless those discrepancies create a

reasonable doubt as to the version of events.

In the case of Mahathun and Others Vs. The Attorney General (2015) 1 SLR

74 it was held:

(1) When faced with contradictions in a witness testimonial, the Court

must bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions,

viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness.

(2) Too great a significance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies, or

contradictions.

(3) What is important is whether the witness is telling the truth on the

material matters concerned with the event.

(4) Where evidence is generally reliable, much importance should not be

attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors.

Page 12 of 15

(5) The Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial judge

with regard to the acceptance or rejection of testimony of a witness

unless it is manifestly wrong.

In the case of State of U.P. Vs. M. K. Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48, it was held:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness the approach must be whether

the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth.

Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to

scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,

drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and

evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the

evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the

evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies

on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach

by taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the evidence,

attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating

officer not going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection

of the evidence as a whole.

It was contended further that, although the learned trial judge has considered

the defence of the appellant diligently, the learned High Court Judge has failed

to give the same attention to the prosecutions version of events, which favoured

the appellant.

However, I am not in a position to agree with such a contention. Although it was

argued on the basis that the defence taken up by the appellant was consent, I

am unable to find any evidence amounting to the appellant admitting having

sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix on the day of the incident. For a person

to take up a defence of consent, he must first admit that sexual intercourse took

place on the day and at the time and at the place where the prosecutrix alleges

that the appellant had sexual intercourse with her against her will, and to take

up the defence that it happened with consent.

Page 13 of 15

When the prosecutrix was cross-examined, it had been suggested to her that she

had consensual sex for over one and half hours with the appellant and after her

son came home and questioned about a cigarette packet found in the house, she

concocted a story against the appellant, which the prosecutrix has denied.

It appears that the time of one and half hours and the questions relating to the

cigarette packet, has been gathered out of the evidence the prosecutrix to make

this suggestion, rather than as a basis for a defence of consent in this regard.

I find that it may be the very reason why, when the appellant was called upon

for his defence, he has not taken such a position in his dock statement. The

position taken up the appellant in his dock statement had been that he had a

long-standing affair with the prosecutrix, a suggestion that has not been put to

her when she gave evidence.

The dock statement of the appellant mainly revolves on the basis that, the son

of the prosecutrix who came to the country after working overseas, came to know

about the affair he had with the prosecutrix, and it was the son who has taken

her to the police and forced her to make a complaint like this.

If that was his position, the relevant person to whom that should have been

suggested was the son (PW-03), when he gave evidence at the trial. Other than

asking about a cigarette packet found in the house, no suggestion had been put

to the son stating that it was he who instigated this complaint, after he found

out about the appellants affair with his mother.

It is well settled law that, if an accused person is taking up a stand against the

evidence placed before the Court, it should be within his prerogative to put

across that position to the relevant witnesses and confront them, so that the

witnesses can respond to his stand.

Page 14 of 15

In the case of Sarwan Singh Vs State of Punjab 2002 AIR Supreme Court iii

3652 at 36755,3656, it was observed;

It is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination it must

follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted. This

case was cited with approval in the case of Boby Mathew Vs State of

Karnataka 2004 3 Cri. L. J.3003

His Lordship Sisira de Abrew, J. stated in Pilippu Mandige Nalaka Krishantha

Kumara Thisera Vs A.G CA 87/2005 decided on 17-05-2007 that;

.I hold that whenever evidence given by a witness on a material point is

not challenged in cross examination, it has to be concluded that such

evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent subject of course

to the qualification that the witness is a reliable witness.

I find that, the learned High Court Judge in his analysis of the appellants

statement, has well considered the above matter and has come to a correct

finding to when the dock statement was rejected on the basis that the defence

taken up by the appellant was inconsistent and has not created any doubt as to

the evidence of the prosecution, or has not provided a reasonable explanation as

to the allegation of rape against him.

In a criminal matter, it is necessary for a trial judge to consider the evidence

placed before it in its totality, be it the evidence of the prosecution, or that of the

defence, and come to a firm finding as to whether the prosecution has proved

the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt or not.

In the Privy Council judgement in Jayasena Vs. Queen 72 NLR 313 (PC) it

was held:

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

Page 15 of 15

whether a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has come to his findings after

considering the totality of the evidence in its correct perspective, which needs no

interference from this Court.

Accordingly, I find no merit in the grounds of appeal urged on behalf of the

appellant. The appeal is dismissed for want of merit.

However, having considered the fact that the appellant has been in incarceration

from his date of conviction on 31-10-2019, it is ordered that his sentence shall

deem to have commenced from 31-10-2019.
