D. N. Samarakoon J.,

The facts narrated by the petitioner are as followed,

2. Facts in Brief

2.1 The Petitioner received her primary and secondary education at

Mahamaya Girts' College, Kandy. As morefully described in the Petition

(Vide paragraph 02 to 04), the Petitioner excelled in her studies and

extracurricular activities, in particular athletics (short distance running)

from her young age and received school colours from 2011 to 2017

continuously. (vide: P2(a) to P2(e), P3(a) to P3(h)

2.2 The Petitioner sat for the General Certificate of Advanced Level

Examination of 2021, (held in February 2022) in her second attempt and

secured 2Bs and 1 A in the Bio Science stream with a Z score of 1.5155

(vide: P6)

2.3 In early September 2022 the UGC called for applications for

admissions to the universities under its purview for the academic year

2021/2022 based on the results of the GCE Advanced Level Examination

of 2021 and the UGC issued the guidelines for admissions for the academic

year 2021/2022 by way of a book. (Vide: P7)

2.4 The Petitioner thereafter submitted an application (vide P.8) to the UGC

over online, as well as by post, for admission to a State university under

the UGC based on her results at the GCE Advanced Level examination

2021 for the academic year 2021/2022. The Petitioner in her application

indicated the courses of study in order of preference based on her Z Score

as required. The 1st to 19th Courses indicated by the Petitioner, in order of

preference are set out in paragraph 10 of the Petition

2.5 After the Petitioner submitted the application to the UGC, and whilst

the said application was being processed, in September 2022, General Sir

John Kothalawala Defence University (hereinafter referred to as KDU) by

4 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

an advertisement published in the newspapers (Vide: P9), called for

applications for admission of students, inter alia, for the course of

Medicine as Cadet Officer students. The Closing date for the submission

of applications for same was 01.10.2022. The Petitioner submitted an

application for admission to KDU as well.

2.6 As pleaded in the Petition, (vide: Paragraph 13) the petitioner faced the

selection process, including Physical Performance Test and Academic and

Mental Performance Test and the Final Medical Test successfully and she

was enrolled as an Enlisted Cadet Officer at KDU.

2.7 After the petitioner was selected to the KDU the UGC informed her via

an email dated 30.11.2022 (vide: P15) that her university admission

application was rejected under Section 1.7 of the UGC Admission

Handbook 2021/2022.

2.8 The 'military training' was an integral component of the Degree

Programme at KDU and the Military Training commenced on 16.12.2022.

The said military training was part of the daily routine and it included,

inter alia, long distance running, rope climbing and other rigorous

physical exercises, which lasted for approximately 4 hours per day, split

between morning and evening sessions.

2.9 Despite the record winning ability to excel in short distance running

during the Petitioner's school days, long distance running was challenging

from the inception of the military training due to a chest pain that occurred

while performing the long-distance running. The Petitioner failed to

perform the given targets.

2.10 As morefully pleaded in paragraph 17, the Petitioner's health

condition was deteriorated and she was referred to the KDU Hospital and

the Army hospital Narahenpita continuously from 27/01/2023. The KDU

management granted her medical leave from 27/01/2023.

5 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

2.11 Since the medical condition of the Petitioner was not improving, the

Board of Management of the KDU at the Board Meeting held on 26.06.2023

granted approval to discharge the Petitioner from KDU and Sri Lanka Army

with effect from 18.06.2023 on medical grounds without having to make

any payment as per the agreement and bond entered into by her with the

university. (vide:P20)

2.12 Thus, the Petitioner ceased to be a registered student of KDU

with effect from 18.06.2023. [Emphasis in the Original]

2.13 Discharge Certificate of the Petitioner from KDU was issued on

06.09.2023 and the letter discharging as an Officer Cadet of Sri Lanka

Army was issued on 08.09.2023. (vide: P21)

2.14 Thus, the Petitioner lost her registration at the KDU on the medical

grounds. That was not foreseeable for the Petitioner. Nor was such a

medical condition detected in the rigorous selection process followed by

the KDU, which included a physical and mental performance and test

(Vide: P11) as well as a Medical Test Vide: P13) With the said discharge

from the KDU the Petitioner was no longer a registered student of a

State funded university, receiving higher education free of charge.

[Full passage highlighted in bold in the original. In this judgment it was

selectively and variably highlighted]

2.15 Thereafter, the Petitioner on 07.09.2023 submitted an appeal to the

UGC, pleading to consider admitting her to a state university based on her

Z Score and the preferences in her university application. (vide:22). The

Petitioner had also submitted an appeal to the President of the Republic,

and the President's Office had forwarded the same to the UGC for

consideration.

2.16 Thereafter, the UGC by P27, rejected the Petitioner's appeal, on the

purported premise that in terms of Clause 1.7.3(ii), the Petitioner is

6 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

disqualified from being considered for admission to the State university

under the purview of the UGC.

2.17 It is the said decision of the UGC, contained in P27, which is made

consequent to the appeal of the Petitioner that is impugned in this

application.

The gist is that,

(i) The petitioner applied to the UGC

(ii) Then she applied to the KDU

(iii) The UGC rejected her application under section 1.7 of the UGC

Admission handbook on 30.11.2022

(iv) She failed KDUs rigorous military training test

(v) She was discharged from it and ceased to be a student of it from

18.06.2023

(vi) She reapplied to UGC to admit her to a university on her Z score

(vii) It was rejected

The UGCs position is that the petitioner is not entitled to enter into a university

under Clause 1.7.3(iii) of the handbook.

The petitioner says Clause 1.7.3(iii) was given an over rigid interpretation and

thereby the UGC fettered its discretion.

What does the clause say?

Its material part is as follows,

Students who were/are registered under free education as internal

students to follow a degree course in a State University/institute

established under any other Act of Parliament in Sri Lanka other than the

Universities Act, No. 16 of 1978 (as amended).

The petitioner says, that, she was a student of the KDU.

7 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

But she ceased to be one.

The synopsis for the respondents says, that, the petitioner continued as a

student of the KDU until she was compelled to discontinue the degree

programme due to health reasons and was issued with a certificate of dismissal

by the KDU on 06.09.2023 which was followed by a letter of discharge.

She has submitted a letter dated 12.08.2023 (P.26) to be considered for a state

university.

It was replied by P. 27.

What did P.27 say?

It says as per the Hand Book for 2021/2022, paragraph 1.7.3(iii) when a student

is / was registered as an Enlisted Officer Cadet of the KDU such a student does

not qualify to be admitted to a state university.

Four questions arise,

(i) How could the petitioner foresee at the time she applied to KDU that she

will not be able to pass a rigorous military test?

(ii) Has not the petitioner on the strength of her Z score a right to select the

course of study she likes best?

(iii) Was it the fault of the petitioner, that, she could not pass the rigorous

military test?

(iv) When the UGC rejected her second application, was she a student of a

recognized state university or institution receiving education free of

charge?

8 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

The above (ii) will be considered ahead of one. It is true that under the system of

free education there is limited scope of choice. But why should that limited

scope too is fettered? Although education is free, the funds spent belongs to

the public. The petitioner is a member of the public.

A former Director of Education, whose outstanding contribution to the education

of this country especially at Matara and Kandy and thereafter at the Open

University at Nawala as its first Director, Regional Educational Services, was

notable, at a felicitation ceremony for senior educationist, on or about

12.12.2016 commented, in the presence of the then Minister of education, that,

what this country needs is the freedom in education, rather than free

education. The Minister said in his speech that he takes serious note of it. That

is the freedom a child (student) has to select the course of study and the

institution of his or her choice. Before the officials who make decisions on such

questions rigidly and harshly deprive children of opportunities for education,

they must realise that the funds employed for the free education are not coming

from the prerogative power of the executive, but from the funds of the working

class, especially not influential entrepreneurs who effect big turn overs (which is

the transfer of money, not the production of wealth) but those who till the rough

land to produce wealth with scarcely available water.

The difference between money and the production of wealth, is explained, the

way it has been done best up to now, by Adam Smith in his work 'An Inquiry

into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations' (commonly called The

Wealth of Nations and in its Third Part, 'Of the different Progress of

Opulence in different Nations' and in the second chapter in that section named

'Of the Discouragement of Agriculture in the ancient State of Europe after

the Fall of the Roman Empire'. Alice O'Connor, better known by her pen name

Ayn Rand, was a Russian-born American author and philosopher. She is known

9 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism1.

Among other famous quotes of her, she has said,

What greater wealth is there than to own your life and to spend it on

growing? Every living thing must grow. It can't stand still. It must grow or

perish2.

Although it is not certain, whether, she meant that or not, the growth of life

without education does not make that growth appreciate, that, the value the

money represents ceases when it cannot transact any more, but, the efficacy of

wealth would remain independent of transactions.

It would be obvious, now, that, (i) and (iii) must be answered in the negative.

In regard to (iv) there is no doubt, that, the emphasis by the decision makers

was on the words, Nidahas adyapana awasthawak yatathe abyanthara sisun

lesa liyapadinchi wee siti / sitina sisun

The purported rationale is in clause 1.6 of the same Handbook, which is

reproduced below,

1 Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two Broadway plays, Rand achieved fame with her 1943 novel The Fountainhead. In 1957, she published her best-selling work, the novel Atlas Shrugged. Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays. 2 https://www.azquotes.com/author/12074-Ayn_Rand/tag/money

An answer to this lopsided logic, a better one, has been given by Justice Upali

de Z. Gunawardana. It is as follows,

Expelling for Life:

The News Paper the Morning in its issue of 05th April 2021 under title

Expanding judicial review guides, not undermines, public authorities

reported about an article written by the then President of the Court of Appeal,

Justice Arjuna Obeyesekera. The title of the article was Expanding the scope of

substantial judicial review. It was said that Justice Obeysekera noted the

proposition, which was the title of the news item.

The news item said, [quoting from the article of Justice Obeyesekera]

The principle of proportionality is another standard ground for judicial

review. In the case of Premaratne vs. University Grants Commission

and Others, the Court of Appeal (Justice Upali De Z. Gunawardana

joined by Justice Hector S. Yapa, the latter who later became a Judge

of the Supreme Court {SC}) concurred with the view of the Master of the

Rolls (MR) of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, Lord Alfred

Thompson Denning in R vs. Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, Ex

parte Hook which illustrates that if any action or measure is considered

to do more harm than good in reaching a given objective, it is liable to be

set aside, for the court has to consider whether the ends justify the

means.

.

In the subsequent case of Neidra Fernando vs. Ceylon Tourist Board and

Others, the Court of Appeal (Justice Gunawardana), while holding that

the allegation of bias regarding the recommendation to dismiss the

petitioner from service was well founded, added however that the

recommended punishment was disproportionate, even though the Court

noted that there has been and remains some uncertainty as to the extent

11 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

to which the notion of proportionality may or should be considered to be

a ground of review.

..

The Court of Appeal has however held that the case of N.V. Gooneratne

vs. The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation and

Others (Justice Anil Gooneratne joined by the then President of the

Court, Presidents Counsel {PC} Sathya Hettige, both of whom later

became Judges of the SC) was a fit and proper case to apply the doctrine

of proportionality. [the remarks within parentheses are by Justice

Obeyesekere].

It is to be noted, that, the first two judgments were authored by Justice

Upali de Z. Gunawardana, one of the finest Judges of this country.

It must also be noted, as evident from the remarks Justice Obeyesekera made in

the parenthesis, that, like the other justices whose names have been mentioned,

Justice Gunawardana had not been elevated to the Supreme Court, the highest

authority of justice.

Justice Gunawardana who was a practitioner in Kalutara Bar was a career Judge

who was appointed a Magistrate, District Judge, High Court Judge and a Judge

of the Court of Appeal. He chose the career of a judge.

The other three justices whose names are mentioned were not career judges.

They joined public service as officers of the Attorney Generals Department.

But all three of them were elevated to the Supreme Court.

All three of them joined the Judiciary as Judges of the Court of Appeal.

The judgment of Justice Upali de Z. Gunawardana, in the Court of Appeal, cited

by its former President Justice Arjuna Obeyesekera in R. L. Premarathne vs.

The University Grants Commission is in itself a tour de force to say the least.

12 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

It was a case of expelling for life, as Justice Gunawardana said, a final year

MBBS Student of Ruhunu University, who has even sat the Final MBBS

Examination and awaiting results, on the basis that she had earlier registered

to follow a course in biological science in Sri Jayewardenepura University which

she failed to disclose in her later application to follow MBBS course.

While the commendable propositions enunciated in that judgment as far as the

law is concerned, one of which had attracted the attention of Justice

Obeyesekera too, are many, only one passage from it, on facts, is cited below to

show the judicious character in which Justice Gunawardane dealt with the

matter.

What I am seeking to pin point is this: that is, if the petitioner had known

on the very day that the results of the GCE Advanced Level examination

held in the year 1979 were released, ie on 12.10.1979 that she was

qualified to be admitted to the faculty of medicine - she wouldn't have

allegedly got herself registered two days later, ie on 15.10.1979 to follow a

course in Biological science on the basis of the results of the GCE

Advanced Level examination held in the year 1978. It was somewhat of a

queer situation. It is not the case that the petitioner acquired the

qualification to be eligible for admission on a date later than 12.10.1979

on which date the results (of the GCE Advanced Level examination held in

1979) which qualified her or made her eligible for admission to the faculty

of Medicine were released; although she was later held or found to be

qualified on the self-same results that were in fact released on 12.10.1979

to be admitted to the medical faculty - yet she did not know of it till after

she got herself admitted to faculty of Biological science assuming of

course, that she had done so. This is one of the mitigating

circumstances that deserved or rather demanded consideration in

favour of the petitioner but which had not been taken into the

reckoning at any level or stage by those who were instrumental in

13 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

imposing the punishment of getting the petitioner to withdraw from

the faculty of medicine for life or for ever. [Emphasis added in this

judgment].

Justice Gunawardana noted, that, it is, by no means, rational conduct on the

part of the authorities concerned to permit a student to sit for the GCE Advanced

level examination a second time and yet impose a prohibition against the student

seeking admission to the faculty of the students choice on the better

performance at the later (subsequent) examination.

While there was no admission, at any stage, by the said student that she

fraudulently withheld information (her personal file from the Sri

Jayewardenepura University was not forthcoming) the judgment did not have to

make a ruling on it since the 01st respondent, The University Grants

Commission, after 06 years of its decision to expel her has rescinded that

decision. The Court also noted, that, the Commission, which had the authority

under the statute to decide upon the punishment has merely and mechanically

followed the recommendation of the Inquirer, who was a retired Judge of the

Supreme Court (retired in 1984). Justice Gunawardana said that the

Commission merely acted as a conduit to convey that recommendation as its

decision. Even after the Commission rescinded its decision to expel her for life,

the Ruhunu University was withholding the release of her results, for which she

sought a mandamus. The Court while formerly granting a certiorari to quash the

decision of the Commission granted mandamus too.

Justice Gunawardana in one of His Lordships noteworthy passages said,

The reasoning of the inquirer reproduced above, with respect,

typifies "an outrageous defiance of logic". After all, what can one do

after one has been found guilty, rightly or wrongly, except to plead for

forgiveness or mercy. It is to be observed, even as remarked by the

inquirer, the petitioner had stoutly protested her innocence throughout.

Plea for mercy or leniency is never an unerring pointer to or

14 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

"confirmation" of guilt, as the inquirer seems to have thought - as it

would have been, if the petitioner had admitted guilt and pleaded for

mercy. Consequences of deprivation ought to be considered for a penalty

to be proportionate and a penalty which is disproportionately draconian

must be quashed as being an excessively severe penalty. The doctrine of

proportionality which works on the assumption that any action or

punishment ought not to go beyond the scope necessary to achieve its

desired result has found a place in case law, for instance, in R. v. Barnsley

ex. p. Hook H 4) which illustrates that if any action or measure is

considered to do more harm than good in reaching a given objective it is

liable to be set aside for the court has to consider whether ends justify the

means.

When Justice Gunawardana was a senior High Court Judge in Colombo he had

to hear the trial in the criminal defamation case of Sinha Ratnatunge (Editor of

The Sunday Times) vs. The State. The virtual complainant was the President of

the Republic. It was a prolonged trial and Hon. Gunawardanas promotion to the

Court of Appeal which was due could not be effected during its pendency. The

Editor was convicted. Hon. Gunawardana was appointed to the Court of Appeal

within two weeks of that. The Sunday Times published that the Free Media

Movement questions this. What actually happened was, that, due to that High

Court Trial his promotion to be effected in the ordinary course was delayed. That

and the comparatively advanced age of career judges when appointed to the

Court of Appeal, after an island wide long career as a judge, prevented Justice

Gunawardana, that erudite and sagacious Judge reaching the Supreme Court.

Justice Gunawardana as High Court Judge of Colombo had to face an

occupational hazard common to most career judges, at sometime or the other in

their comparatively long career, when they had to give decisions in cases that

arouse public attention. It is only the judge who hears the evidence in full

and reads every material part of the brief who knows, that, the public

15 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

sentiment is not always right and often based on preconceived

misconceptions. This is the greatest drawback in a democracy which

however most countries have accepted despite that having several

drawbacks, as a somewhat better alternative for monarchy, anarchy,

bureaucracy or communism.

Like, the student in R. L. Premarathne vs. The University Grants Commission

how could the petitioner know, that, she will not pass the physical fitness test?

Furthermore, it was not due to her fault or negligence. It was beyond her control.

The petitioner cites Wade and Forsyth Administrative Law 12th Edition page 268

which says,

4. OVER-RIGID POLICIES

A. POLICY AND PRECEDENT

An authority can fail to give its mind to a case, and thus fail to exercise its

discretion lawfully by blindly following a policy laid down in advance

(For discussion see (1972) 18 McGill LJ 310 (H. L. Molot); [1976] P.L. 332 (D.

J. Galligan).). It is a fundamental rule for the exercise of discretionary

power that discretion must be brought to bear on every case:

each one must be considered on its own merits and decided as the public

interest requires at the time. The Greater London Council was criticised

for disregard of this principle when it proceeded to make a large subsidy

to the London bus and underground services as a matter of course

because the ruling party had promised to do so in their election campaign

(Bromley LBC vs. Greater London Council [1983] 1 AC 768 (Lords Diplock

and Brandon)). They regarded themselves as irrevocably committed in

advance, whereas their duty was to use their discretion. Nor may a local

authority lawfully refuse all applications for housing for children of

families considered to be intentionally homeless (see above page 57)

since the power to produce housing implies a duty to consider the

16 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

different circumstances of each child (A G ex rel Tilley vs. Wandsworth

LBC [1981] 1 WLR 854 (declaration that resolution was unlawful)). Another

example was where the Home Office took a decision to delay consideration

of older asylum applications in order that they might meet the targets set

for consideration of the more recent applications. .

In enforcing this rule, the courts are underlining the difference between

judicial and administrative processes. The legal rights of litigants are

decided according to legal rules and precedents so that like cases are

treated alike. But if an administrative authority acts in this way its

decision is ultra vires and void. It is not allowed to 'pursue consistency

at the expense of the merits of individual cases (Merchandise Transport

Ltd., vs. British Transport Commission [1962] 2 Q. B. 173 at 193). This

doctrine is applied even to statutory tribunals, despite their resemblance

to courts of law (See Regina vs. Greater Brimingham Appeal Tribunal ex P

Simper [1974] Q. B. 543 (tribunal applied rule of thumb instead of exercising

discretion: decision quashed)). But it does not apply to prerogative powers.

Just how far they may enforce a fixed policy is often a difficult question for

authorities granting licences or permits. A clear instance was where an

applicant for permission to sell pamphlets in public parks for the benefit

of the blind was told that the Council had decided to grant no such

permits, and could make no exception even in the most deserving case.

The court regarded that 'not as the adoption of a policy in the exercise of

a discretion but as a refusal to exercise any discretion' (quoted from Banks

L. J., in Rex vs. Port of London Authority ex p. Kynoch Ltd., [1919] 1 K. B.

176 at 185) and granted mandamus to compel the Council to consider the

application (Rex vs. London County Council ex p. Corrie [1918] 1 K. B. 68).

It did not follow that they must give permission or that they might not

follow a policy: their duty was merely to exercise their discretion in each

17 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

case and not to shut the door indiscriminately either on all applicants or

on applicants who did not conform to some particular requirement.

Consequently a local education authority may follow its own rules in

allotting pupils to schools provided that its motives are not unreasonable,

capricious or irrelevant, and provided that it is ready to consider

exceptional cases (Cumings vs. Brikenhead Cpn [1972] Ch. 12, where Lord

Denning M. R. expounds the rules as to policy). Where it is at liberty to make

a choice between conflicting policies, it may decide to make no exceptions,

as where it adopts a policy of making all schools in its area into

comprehensive schools and abolishing all grammar schools (Smith vs.

Inner London Education Authority [1978] 1 All E R 411). But even then it is

in a stronger position if it has listened fairly to the objections of parents

and others concerned. Similarly, a decision-maker may depart from their

usual policy provided they act fairly and rationally and give those adversely

affected an opportunity to make representations why the usual policy

should be followed. [Emphasis added in this judgment].

The petitioner cites the book of Dr. Stanley de Smith, which now goes as De

Smiths Judicial Review and Harry Woolf is the Chief Editor.

Underlying rationale

The underlying rationale of the principle against fettering discretion is to

ensure that two perfectly legitimate values of public law, those of legal

certainty and consistency (qualities at the heart of the principle of the rule

of law), may be balanced by another equally legitimate public law

value, namely, that of responsiveness (Regina vs. Minister for

Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Ex p. Hamble Fisheries (Offshore) Ltd [1995]

2 All E R 714 at 722). While allowing rules and policies to promote the

former values, it insists that the full rigour of certainty and

consistency be tempered by the willingness to make exceptions, to

respond flexibly to unusual situations, and to apply justice in the

individual case (D. Galligan, The Nature and Functions of Policy within

Discretionary Power [1976] P. L. 332). Moreover, it must be remembered

that an inflexible policy could prioritize consistency at the expense

of equal treatment in fact.. (page 515). [Emphasis added in this

judgment].

Wade and Smith both, it appears to this Court, referred to D. J. Galligan [1976]

The Nature and Functions of Policy within Discretionary Power.

The book Due Process and Fair Procedures A Study of Administrative

Procedures by the same writer D. J. Galligan, Clarendon Press Oxford, 1996,

available at the Judges Library also has a part that is relevant. In Chapter 03

titled Rights, Procedures and Costs and at page 108, under 3.2.4 The Right to

Consideration, he says, that,

3.2.4 The Right to Consideration

Against that background, let us now consider how to give content to the general

principle, to identify the values which should be inserted into it. One idea is

often expressed in terms of non-arbitrariness, the claim being that each

person has a right to be treated in a way that is non-arbitrary (For a

discussion on these lines, see T. M. Scanlon, 'Due Process' in Pennock and

Chapman, Due Process, n. 19 above). Now arbitrariness is an elusive concept,

but it does convey an idea of what is important in the relationship between citizen

and state: the individual with (Pg 109) his interests and concerns in some sense

counts in the deliberations of the discretionary decision-maker (One of the

difficulties in trying to use arbitrariness as a critical concept is that what amounts

to arbitrariness depends on what it means, in different contexts, to take a person

into account; arbitrariness is of no help in answering that question). Individual

persons are very much affected by discretionary decisions where the wider public

interest is the main concern, and the fact that some of the most fundamental

interests in liberty, property, livelihood, and status are vulnerable to

administrative action is a sound basis for restraint in pursuit of the public

19 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

interest. It is then a short step to a normative principle which takes account of

that vulnerability and justifies minimum standards of protection.

The principle may be called the principle of consideration, suggesting that

the interests of those affected must be taken into account, while allowing

that ultimately they may be overridden by wider notions of public interest.

But while a sense of public interest may prevail, it does so only after proper

account is taken of the interests affected. The principle insists on the official

responding to those interests while retaining the decision as to the course of

action finally to be followed. The principle of consideration guarantees no

result, but it shows that the interests of persons are an element of the

public interest and should be taken seriously. The principle of consideration

in turn generates a right to consideration (The argument here is presented in more

detail in D. J. Galligan, 'Rights, Discretion and Procedure' in Sampford and

Galligan, Law, Rights and the Welfare State, n. 13 above). We now have a clear

thread running between basic, moral, and legal rights: the basic right to be

treated with respect as a person justifies a moral right to consideration in the

affairs of government, while that moral right provides the case for a legal right to

certain standards of fair treatment governing the exercise of discretion. The

standards in turn generate rights to appropriate procedures.

The right to consideration in discretionary decisions might be compelling in

principle but seems hopelessly vague in practical application. The sentiment is

noble: each person should count and administrators are never justified in simply

ignoring the interests of those affected. But how does it help the prisoner seeking

parole, the applicant for a licence, or the objectors to the motorway? What is

necessary in such cases to satisfy the right to consideration and so to avoid

treating the person unfairly? The answers to such questions are unlikely to be

clear or simple; since the range of administrative decisions is variable, and the

interests that may be affected are diverse, the right balance between the public

interest and regard for the individual person is likely also to be variable. This

20 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

can be illustrated by contrasting an individualized decision, whether to grant

parole for example, and the decision as to which route a motorway should follow

(For the classification of administrative decisions as adjudicative, modified

adjudicative, specific policy, and general policy, see my discussion in

Discretionary Powers, n. 12 above, 114-17). In the parole case, it is (Pg 110)

reasonable to expect close attention to be paid to the situation of the prisoner,

even though, finally, the decision might be made to deny parole because of the

need to protect the public. But in order for the decision to be justifiable, the

parole agency should inquire closely into the facts about the prisoner's case, his

record in prison, and the likely risk he would pose to the public. In making the

motorway decision, on the other hand, many people, interests, and factors are

involved and, while all must be considered, the principle of consideration in

respect of any one person or interest would demand less. It might be enough, in

justifying the decision, to show that the many claims and arguments put forward

have been looked at, that some of them are irreconcilable, and that finally a

course has been settled which is rational, reasonable, and in good faith.

.

Pg 111

The right to consideration adds to policy decisions a value which must be

respected in decision-making. The value remains constant across different

decisions, but the practical standards needed to ensure respect for it vary

according to the context3. The right to consideration in turn justifies rights to

procedures, the procedures being those necessary to ensure proper

consideration in the discretionary process. They will normally include familiar

procedural forms: knowing the issues to be decided and where possible the

criteria to be applied; having an opportunity to make one's case, to address the

issues, and to respond to others; and being provided with an explanation and

justification for the final decision. The right to consideration does not necessarily

3 This is very important as this Court sees.

mean that all or any of these particular procedures are to be followed; for

example, the right to consideration does not necessarily include the power to

participate. Participation will normally be a part of the right, but participation is

an instrument to proper consideration and whether it is needed in a given

context will depend on the context. The same applies to other procedures; the

justification for each is that it is instrumental to the principle of consideration.

Sufficient steps may have been taken at an earlier stage to ensure adequate

consideration of those affected, with the result that no special procedures are

needed at the administrative level. According to the principle of selective

representation it is necessary to ensure only that, taking the policy process as a

whole, the interests of groups and individuals are properly considered (On the

principle of selective representation, see Galligan, Discretionary Powers, n. 12

above, section 7.3.2). The principle of consideration can be satisfied in a number

of ways at a number of points in the regulatory process (A point along these lines

is well made by T. M. Scanlon in his essay 'Due Process' in Pennock and Chapman,

Due Process, n. 19 above).

To conclude, the starting point in developing the right to consideration was the

recognition that important values about the treatment of persons apply to

discretionary decision-making even where the overriding concern is the public

interest. The basis for those values and the standards based on them is a moral

view about the relationship between the citizen and the state. Views may differ

about the precise terms of the relationship and therefore about the normative

standards governing it. I suggest, how- ever, that there is a central and

irreducible principle that, in the discretionary, policy-making functions of the

administrative state, the interests, circumstances, and concerns of individuals

and groups should be taken into account in making a decision. This right to

consideration of course has to be (Pg 112) interpreted in each context, but my

suggestion is that it is morally compelling in the sense that it should be included

in any set of acceptable principles governing the citizen-state relationship. The

right to consideration can be seen at work in notions of non-arbitrariness,

22 | C . A . W r i t 7 6 5 2 0 2 3 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 0 t h M a y 2 0 2 4

purposiveness, and reasonableness; but it goes beyond them and

constitutes a dynamic principle of fair treatment. The right to consideration

in turn generates and justifies suitable procedural rights. Finally, the right to

consideration is not the only right in the discretionary, policy-making context.

There may be other standards of fair treatment which ground other rights,

principles of consistency and non- discrimination being examples4. [Emphasis

added in this judgment, to Professor Galligans text].

["Definition of first water". Collins English Dictionary. Retrieved 7 December 2012]. The clarity of diamonds is assessed by their translucence; the more like water, the higher the quality. The 1753 edition of Chambers's Encyclopaedia states "The first water in Diamonds means the greatest purity and perfection of their complexion, which ought to be that of the clearest drop of water. When Diamonds fall short of this perfection, they are said to be of the second or third water, &c. till the stone may be properly called a coloured one." The phrase first water is also used more generally to refer to the highest quality or most extreme example of a person or thing, not just gemstones. ["Definition of first water". Collins English Dictionary. Retrieved 7 December 2012]. The comparison of diamonds with water dates back to at least the early 17th century, and Shakespeare alludes to it in Pericles, 1607.

see a reasonable explanation as to why the UGC should reject the

is for education to prepare students to lead successful, fulfilling

The petitioner does not seek now to follow a course that would produce a

physician in a state university. She still has a legitimate expectation of obtaining

a qualification in either

and

The petitioner has filed an application under the Right to Information Act.

The request was for the 4th respondent University of Peradeniya to reveal the

number of vacancies still available for above three courses of study.

The documents marked P.36(a), P.36(b), P.37 and P.45 have been produced by

that University, which would not have been produced if not for the Right to

The new approach taken by this Court in two of the Right to Information cases

referring, among other things, to the panopticon and anti panopticon two

concepts attributed to Jeremy Bentham was appreciated as a step in the right

direction.

In the article There is so much more to the RTI Act published in The Daily

Star, of Bangladesh, on Monday, 13th March 2024, Dr Shamsul Bari and Ruhi

Naz who are the chairman and assistant director (RTI), respectively, at Research

Initiatives, Bangladesh (RIB) said as follows,

Two most recent examples from Sri Lanka may help to illustrate

the point. Since the adoption of the RTI Act there in 2016, alert

citizens and a supportive information commission, assisted by a

helpful judiciary, have made strategic use of the law. So much so that

it led the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to recommend

promotion of greater use of the law by citizens to accelerate the

country's recovery from the severe economic crisis it suffered

recently. [Emphasis added in this judgment]

In the first case, a February 2024 ruling by the Court of Appeal (CA) upheld

a 2021 directive by the Right to Information Commission (RTIC) of Sri

Lanka which ordered a state bank to release the marksheets of candidates

who sat for the island-wide competitive recruitment examination. The

directive was related to an appeal filed at the RTIC by an unsuccessful

candidate wanting to know why she was not recruited despite passing the

examination.

In upholding the commission's directive, the CA dismissed the bank's

revision application. And Justice DN Samarakoon, who authored the

judgment, further underlined that, though the marks obtained by other

candidates could indeed qualify as "personal information," it was "in the

interests of the public that public examinations on the basis of which

citizens are recruited to occupations on merit, must be honest, upright

and transparent." He emphasised that since the information concerned

was related to a public activity or interest, a concerned citizen had the

constitutional "right to know" it. There was, therefore, no unjustified

invasion of privacy in releasing the merit list prepared on individual marks.

A more incisive observation by the judge was that the RTI Act brings the

state to the "receiving end of asymmetrical surveillance." Citizens now

have the power to question the state while "the State has to police itself

for fear of adverse public opinion." This is the "opposite of the

surveillance State the roles have been changed; the observer has

now become the observed." A profound observation with deep

implications for all concerned! [Emphasis added in this judgment]

In the second case, the RTIC directed Litro Gas Lanka Ltd of Sri Lanka to

release the salary and loan details of some top officials of the company to

an appellant who claimed that he was unfairly terminated by the company,

which, despite its claim otherwise, was indeed a Public Authority as 99.7

percent of its shares were owned by the state. A key aspect of the CA

judgment was that while information on salaries is indeed personal

information, it is overridden where public funds are involved.

The court went on to add that grounds such as commercial interests, trade

secrets, and competitive position of a third party are not relevant when

salary information is sought, and that Litro Gas, in challenging the

directive of the RTIC, had "failed to understand the true nature ... of the

Sri Lankan RTI Act." The court further added that reputation, rights of

others and privacy were overridden by public interest according to the Sri

Lankan Constitution itself.

Unfortunately, RTI use in Bangladesh so far has given rise to very few

cases involving such in-depth interpretation of key provisions of the

law by the Information Commission. And even in the few cases where

such possibilities exist, it is rare for our citizens to challenge them in the

High Court. It's time our civil society leaders, social and political

elites, and ardent change-makers discovered the tremendous scope

and promise of the RTI Act6. [Emphasis added in this judgment]

saying,
