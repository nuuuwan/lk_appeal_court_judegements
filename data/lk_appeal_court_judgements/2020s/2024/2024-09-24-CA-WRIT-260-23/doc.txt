k. Grant costs;

l. and Grant such other further reliefs that Your Lordships' Court shall seem meet.

When the matter came up on 21.05.2024, the Counsel for the Respondents has taken the

preliminary objections with regard to the maintainability of this action. Accordingly, all

parties have filed written submissions. The Counsel for the 7th Respondent has informed

the following facts to the Courts in their written submission:

The Petitioner has filed this application challenging the elections of the National

Gymnastic Association which has already been held on 29.05.2023. After the said election,

the 7th Respondent has won the election along with some other members who are not made

a party to this action. Further, he brought to notice that, the Gazettes that are purportedly

challenged by the Petitioner namely, 2310/26, 2310/27 and 2310/28 all dated 14.12.2022

have now been replaced by a subsequent Gazette bearing No. 2382/32 issued on

03.05.2024 which was marked as A.

The said Gazette in Part (V) has mentioned that these Gazettes have been rescinded.

However, the Petitioner moved to quash the said Gazettes which are not in force now.

Thus, the reliefs sought by the Petitioner to quash the said Gazettes are rendered futile.

Although the Petitioner admitted that the said Gazettes are not in force, the Petitioner

seeks to quash any action taken under and in terms of the said Gazettes.

Objection was raised regarding the 7th Respondent's nomination for the said election by

Matara District Gymnastic Association where the Petitioner is the Secretary. The

independent Election Committee had examined the objection with regard to the

nomination in terms of Gazette No. 2215/47. Later, the Petitioner came to know that,

despite the rejection of the 7th Respondents nomination, the 1st Respondent recommended

the said nomination to the Independent Election Committee bearing No.

MOSYA/MIN/SH-11.

In the instant application, the Petitioner moves to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent

encapsulated in correspondence bearing No. MOSYA/MIN/SH-11 dated 27.04.2023 on the

basis that the said recommendation is of ultra vires. However, the said correspondence is

not before this Court.

The impact of not producing such decision before the Court is considered by his Lordship

Janak de Silva J in Finest Tea Exports (Private) Limited and Another v. Chulananda

Perera and Others, CA WRTIT Application No. 209/2017, Decided on 04.10.2019, that;

The Petitioners also seek a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the 3rd to

6th Respondents and/or anyone or more of them not to permit the Petitioners to

upgrade the whole quantity of tea contained in the said consignments. However,

there is no such decision before Court. In Weerasooriya v. The Chairman, National

Housing Development Authority and Others [CA. Application No. 866/98, C.A.M.

08.03.2004] Sripavan J. (as he was then) held that the court will not set aside a

document unless it is specifically pleaded and identified in express language in the

prayer to the petition.

Further, the main relief prayed by the Petitioner is to quash the decision of the

Independent Election Committee allowing the 7th Respondent to participate in the

election.

One of the objections taken by the Respondent is that, under the Gazette bearing No.

2085/56 dated 22.09.2018 which was marked as 7R-1(3), there is a provision available for

the Petitioner to appeal the decision of the Independent Election Committee which reads

as follows:

(h) Any person dissatisfied with any decision of the Election Committee shall

appeal within one week to the Minister in charge of the subject of Sports, as per

Regulation 8(1).

The said Gazette was later amended by the Gazette bearing No. 2207/7 dated 23.12.2020

which was marked as 7R-1(6). Accordingly, there is a procedure set out with regard to

appeal.

(2) Upon receipt of an appeal, the Minister may refer such appeal to

the Appeal advisory committee referred to in sub-regulation (3) of the

regulation.

(3) (a) The Minister may establish an Appeal Advisory Committee

consisting of seven members to consider the appeal and to make recommendations

thereon to him. The Minister shall not be bound to by any of the recommendations

given by the members of such Committee.

(b) The Appeal Advisory Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "Committee")

shall consist of a panel of retired Judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, persons

who have wide knowledge and experience in the field of law and person who have

contributed for the development of the sports of Sri Lanka.

(c) The retired Judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka shall be the Chairman of

the committee and in the absence of the Chairman, the members shall elect a

member to preside at the meeting.

Page 8 of 10

(d) Where the Minister refers an appeal to the Committee, the Chairman

shall appoint at least three members, from among the members of the

committee, to consider and make recommendations on such appeal to the

Minister within fourteen days from the date of reference of the

appeal.

(4) The Minister shall, on consideration of all relevant facts on the

appeal inform his decision with the reason therefore to the appellant

and the relevant National Sports Association within one month of the

receipt of such appeal.

It is clear that, the Petitioner was provided with a comprehensive alternative remedy by

the aforesaid Sports Regulations. But the Petitioner has not availed himself of this

remedy.

In Tennakoon v. Director-General of Customs and Another (2004) 1 SLR 53 at page 56,

his Lordship Wijayaratne, J. held that:

The petitioner in this application seeks to challenge the

forfeiture made under section 119 of the Customs Ordinance by a writ application

when in fact the Customs Ordinance itself provides for such a

course of action under section 154. The petitioner is not

therefore without an alternative suitable remedy. The petitioner is not entitled

to seek the writ jurisdiction of this court when there is an alternative remedy

available to him. In the Sarvodaya case(1) it was held Ordinarily the only

remedy available to the petitioner for

claiming the said goods is to institute proceedings in terms of

section 154, challenging the validity of the seizures

Page 9 of 10

In Rev. Maussagolle Dharmarakkitha Thero And Another Vs. Registrar Of Lands And

Others (2005) 3 SLR 11, His Lordship Sisira De Abrew J held that;

The Petitioners had a right of appeal against the decision of the 1st Respondent

contained in PS. This right has been given to them under section 3S(1) of the said

Ordinance. The learned Counsel for the Petitioners contended that the Petitioners

were unaware of the decision made by the 1st Respondent refusing to register the

deed P4. The Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs, by his letter dated 16.06.1995

marked P7, informed the 3rd Respondent a copy of which was sent to the 1st

Petitioner that transfer of property by deed No. 3062 (P4) could not be approved

since the property was Sangika property. The petitioners, in their petition have

admitted this position. Therefore it is safe to conclude that the 1st petitioner was

aware of the decision of the Commissioner of Buddhist Affairs who is the 2nd

respondent. Then it was within the knowledge of the 1st Petitioner that the 1st

Respondent was going to refuse the registration of deed P4. For these reasons, I

am unable to agree with the above contention of the learned Counsel for the

Petitioners.

In view of the above facts it is clear that the Petitioners have not used the right of

appeal given to them under section 3S (1) of the said Ordinance. The Petitioners

have, therefore, not used the alternative remedy available to them.

In the instant case, the Petitioner has failed to make an appeal to the relevant authority.

We hold that, failure to proceed with the appeal in terms of the said regulation is fatal.

For the above-said reasons, we uphold the preliminary objections taken by the

Respondents and dismiss the application with costs.
