WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Puttalam on

20 counts. The first count is committing Criminal Misappropriation of

sum of Rs. 2,685,550/- belonging to the Kalpitiya Branch of the

Peoples Bank during the period of 31st of January 2001 to 06th

September 2001, an offence punishable under Section 5(1) of the

Offences against Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982 as amended by Act

No.76 of 1988. Further, the appellant was indicted on the 2nd to 20th

counts for dishonestly or fraudulently inducing bank officers to pay

money to certain individuals who acted on behalf of the appellant and

pawned fake jewellery items, offences punishable under Section 5(1) of

the same Act. As the prosecution witness No. 7 and 12 were abroad at

the time of the trial, the 2nd to 20th counts were withdrawn by the

prosecution and the trial proceeded against the accused-appellant on

the first count only. After trial, the learned High Court Judge convicted

the accused-appellant for the first count and imposed a sentence of 10

Page 3 of 12

years simple imprisonment and a fine of Rs.8,056,650.00/- which

carries a default sentence of 10 years simple imprisonment. This appeal

is preferred against the said conviction and the sentence.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions had been filed on behalf of

both parties. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents

Counsel for the appellant and the learned Additional Solicitor General

for the respondent made oral submissions. The learned Additional

Solicitor General submitted further written submissions with a

schedule outlining how the amount of Rs. 2,685,550/- contained in the

first charge was determined.

Briefly, the prosecution case is as follows:

The accused-appellant served as the Officer in Charge of the Pawning

Division in the Peoples Bank, Kalpitiya Branch during the period of 31st

of January 2001 to 06th September 2001. PW-1, the Manager of the

Peoples Bank, Kalpitiya Branch had initiated a preliminary

investigation on 12.09.2021 after being informed by the Regional Office

to conduct an audit of the bank's pawn stock. This was in response to

a suspected fraud that was discovered in the People's Bank, Negombo

Branch during the appellant's tenure in the Pawning Division of the

said bank. According to the prosecution, the accused-appellant had

repeatedly pawned 2 fake items of jewellery; a gold-plated chain and a

bracelet (P-12 and P-13) to the bank through intermediaries and

obtained money and thereby committing criminal misappropriation of

sum of Rs. 2,685,550/-money belonging to the Peoples Bank.

In the written submissions tendered on behalf of the Accused-Appellant

following grounds of appeal have been urged.

i. The Judgement of the learned High Court Judge is not a

Judgment in terms of Section 283 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

Page 4 of 12

ii. The learned High Court Judge has misconceived in law and

facts as he has failed to appreciate the evidence in the light of

the principles applicable for evaluation of circumstantial

evidence.

iii. The learned Trial Judge has improperly rejected the defence

case.

However, at the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel

for the appellant stressed the fact that as the two keys of the safe were

not with the accused-appellant, he had no opportunity to take back the

jewellery that had been pawned to the bank and pawned repeatedly

through various persons as stated by the prosecution witnesses.

The learned Additional Solicitor General explained in her submission,

the sequence of events which took place in respect of the offence

described in the 1st Count and stated that the accused-appellant

pawned the same jewellery repeatedly for 55 times through other people

such as PW-3, PW-16, PW-17 and PW-20 and misappropriated Rs.

2,685,550/- while being the Officer in Charge of the Pawning Division

of the Peoples Bank, Kalpitiya Branch. She also contended that it was

found that there was a deficit of 55 items in the gold stock of the bank

and that there were two fake jewelries as well.

In order to substantiate the prosecution version, 55 receipts and 2

receipts pertaining to fake jewellery items were produced. The learned

ASG explained by submitting a schedule with further written

submissions, how the total amount mentioned in the 1st charge has

been computed. According to the said schedule, 18 receipts have been

produced through witnesses PW-3, PW-16, PW-17, and PW-20 who

could speak about those receipts and 38 receipts have been produced

through the retired Credit Officer of the Peoples Bank. No connection

of the accused-appellant to the offence has been established in respect

of the other receipt.

Page 5 of 12

The aforesaid 57 receipts have been produced to establish that the

appellant has pawned jewellery to the bank through some other people

and obtained money from the bank. However, there is no evidence that

the appellant pawned the jewellery through some other persons and got

money pertaining to the aforesaid 38 receipts produced through the

retired Credit Officer of the Peoples Bank. In respect of the aforesaid 38

receipts, no witness stated that the appellant asked him or her to pawn

the jewellery. In addition, no witness stated that the money given by the

bank to him or her pertaining to the aforesaid 38 receipts had been

handed over to the appellant. Therefore, any culpability of the accused-

appellant with regard to the aforesaid 38 receipts has not been

established. As it is not established that the accused-appellant had

misappropriated the sum of money pertaining to the aforesaid 38

receipts, the decision of the learned High Court Judge that the entire

amount mentioned in the 1st charge has been misappropriated by the

accused-appellant is incorrect.

Now, this Court has to consider whether the accused-appellant could

be convicted for the balance amount from the amount mentioned in the

1st charge excluding the aggregate amount of money pertaining to the

aforesaid 38 receipts. In the case of M. E. A. Cooray v. The King- 53

N.L.R. 73, Court of Criminal Appeal held that the following direction

given by the learned trial judge to the jury is in conformity with the law:

" If you can find after your examination of the whole of the evidence that

he did commit criminal breach of trust or did dishonestly misappropriate,

not the entire sum alleged by the Crown to have been misappropriated

but some lesser sum, if that fact is proved to you beyond reasonable

doubt, then even though you may not be able to answer with any degree

of accuracy the precise sum, but having made every allowance to the

accused you still are convinced that he had dishonestly misappropriated

a portion of the sum alleged in the indictment, then he would be guilty"

or again:

Page 6 of 12

"Once again I may say, it does not seem to me that it is very important to

determine what is the precise figure which went into his hands, or if he

did appropriate any money, what was appropriated by him ''

Court also observed that In England, the proposition was laid down as

early as 1858 in Regina v. Thomas Wright 1 [169 E. R. 1070] by no less

than five Judges including Judges of the eminence of Lord Campbell C.J.

and Coleridge J. that a verdict of the Jury that the prisoner " stole some

money " but without specifying the amount was a good verdict.

In the Bombay case of Emperor v Byramji Jamsetji Chevalla 3 [A.I.R.

1928 Bom. 148] Fawcett J. had stated that "if the evidence is sufficient

as to establish that at any rate some property such as money has been

misappropriated, it seems to me that it is against reason and authority

to say that because you cannot specify the exact amount that has been

misappropriated the accused cannot be convicted."

The Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the said position in the aforesaid

case of M. E. A. Cooray v. The King in the following manner:

We find ourselves in agreement with the view expressed in the Bombay

case and we hold that a verdict which is specific and definite that the

offence has been committed in respect of some sum of money, though that

sum may not be ascertained with exactness, is a proper and valid verdict

and is not open to the objection that it is vague and therefore bad. We are

further of opinion that the Jury need not have returned a finding as to

what the sum was which in their opinion had been committed criminal

breach of trust of but a verdict that they found the prisoner guilty was all

that was called for.

According to the aforesaid judicial authorities, when it is found that the

accused had misappropriated not the entire sum mentioned in the

charge but some lesser sum, the accused can be convicted for dishonest

misappropriation. In addition, an accused can be convicted although

the exact amount that has been misappropriated has not been

specified.

Page 7 of 12

Therefore, the accused-appellant in this case could be convicted for the

1st charge of Criminal Misappropriation although the amount

misappropriated by the appellant is less than the amount mentioned in

the 1st charge. Also, the Judgment of the learned High Court Judge need

not be set aside for the reason that he found the appellant guilty for

misappropriating the entire amount mentioned in the 1st charge.

In the instant action, the prosecution has led the evidence regarding

2 fake jewellery items (P-12 and P-13) found in the safe. However, the

prosecution failed to establish any link between the accused-appellants

involvement with the fake jewellery items. The witnesses who spoke

about the jewellery given by the appellant to pawn have not identified

these fake items as the jewellery given by the accused-appellant. In fact,

PW-17 has stated in his evidence that it was not the item that was given

by the appellant requesting him to pawn to the bank and get money.

Therefore, no connection has been established with the 2 fake jewellery

items found in the safe to the alleged offence committed by the

appellant.

Hence, this Court proceed to see whether there is any other evidence to

establish appellants culpability. The learned Additional Solicitor

General pointed out that the appellant did not follow the correct

procedure in pawning these jewelries as the officer in charge of the

pawning division of the bank. She stated that evidence has been led to

the effect that appellant had not sent this jewellery for proper valuation

and also the appellant had not referred these items of jewellery to the

other relevant authorities in following the pawning procedure.

In giving evidence, PW-3 identified his signature in receipts marked

P-1 and P-3. PW-17 identified the receipt marked P-6. PW-20 identified

the receipts marked P7-A to P7-O. Although these witnesses have not

identified the jewellery that they pawned, they stated in their testimony

that the same item of jewellery was given by the accused- appellant

Page 8 of 12

again and again to be pawned to the bank. They have also said that

they pawned those jewellery to the bank on the request of the appellant,

obtained money from the bank and handed over that money to the

appellant. They have got a small amount of money from the accused-

appellant.

Evidence has also been led that these pawned items have not been

released by the persons who pawned these items by paying back the

required payment. Therefore, it is apparent that the appellant had

taken back the items of jewellery that was pawned to the bank and

repeatedly pawned the same item to the bank by engaging various

persons.

Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any

movable property commits the offence of dishonest misappropriation

according to Section 386 of the Penal Code. It is to be noted that in the

Penal Code dishonest misappropriation has no other interpretation.

According to Section 22 of the Penal Code, whoever does anything with

the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss

to another person, is said to do that thing dishonestly.

In the case at hand, it is apparent that without paying the amount due

to the bank to redeem the pawned jewellery items, those items of

jewellery repeatedly came to the hands of the appellant and through

various people, the appellant repeatedly pawned the same jewellery,

fake or genuine, to the bank and obtained money from the bank.

Therefore, it has been clearly established that it is a wrongful gain to

the appellant from the funds of the bank. Hence, dishonest

misappropriation of the funds of the bank has been established.

According to the evidence of PW-16, jewellery had not been given to her.

However, the appellant had taken her signature to the documents and

had got money from the bank according to her evidence. The relevant

Page 9 of 12

receipt has been marked as P-8. That is also misappropriation of the

funds of the bank.

The aforesaid sequence of events provides an answer to the argument

of the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant that the learned

High Court Judge has failed to appreciate the evidence in the light of

the principles applicable for evaluation of circumstantial evidence. It is

correct that one of the keys was with PW-1 and the other key was with

a person called Seram according to the evidence of PW-1. (Page 588

and 603 of the Appeal Brief) The accused-appellant did not possess any

of the keys.

According to the prosecution evidence, PW-1 (Bank Manager) and the

Second Officer had the keys to the safe and both the key which was

with PW-1 and the key that was with the Second Officer should be used

to open the safe. Neither PW-1 nor the Second Officer can open the safe

using the one key they possessed. When the safe was opened in the

presence of PW-1 and the Second Officer, the appellant was the one

who took out and put the jewelries from the safe to a tray and confirmed

whether all the jewelries that should have been in the safe are in fact

there in the safe. (Page 602- 605 of the Appeal Brief) Although, PW-1

and the Second Officer have to exercise supervision over this act of

handling jewellery, due to the limited space in the place where the safes

were kept no one could actually see whether the appellant actually put

the items in the tray and confirmed that the items are present. Nobody

could see whether he took any item from the safe and put it in his

pocket or kept it with him in any other manner.

It is clearly established from the prosecution evidence that the appellant

is the one who puts the pawned jewellery in the safe and takes them

out. Therefore, the appellant had access to the safe. The appellant had

access to the safe in the presence of the officers who possessed with the

keys. However, it has been revealed from the evidence that when the

Page 10 of 12

appellant was placing the jewellery in the safe or taking back the

jewellery from the safe, any other person could not see whether in fact,

he has placed the jewellery in the safe or whether he has taken them

out of the safe. (Page 643, 735 of the Appeal Brief) The other officers

rely on what he says as to whether the items that should have been in

the safe are actually there. In the circumstances, there is no dispute

on the fact that the appellant also had ample opportunities to access

the safes as the officer in charge of the pawning division of the bank.

As decided in a line of judicial authorities, when a fact is proved by

circumstantial evidence, there should be no room for an involvement of

any other person other than the accused and the proved items of

circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.

Jewellery pertaining to 55 receipts have been missing. Witnesses of the

prosecution stated as mentioned previously that the appellant gave

same items of jewellery to pawn. Although, the witnesses have not

identified the jewellery that they were given to pawn, they have clearly

stated that the same items of jewellery were given by the appellant to

pawn. The said evidence clearly demonstrates that the accused-

appellant and no other person had taken back the jewellery that was

pawned once from the bank and that the same jewellery were given to

those witnesses to pawn them repeatedly. Hence, it is clear from the

evidence that no other person but the appellant had taken the jewellery

from the bank. There was no room for any other persons involvement

because the same jewellery came to the hands of the appellant who

placed the jewellery in the safe repeatedly. Therefore, I regret that the

argument of the learned Presidents Counsel that the principles

applicable for evaluation of circumstantial evidence has not been

properly applied by the learned High Court Judge cannot be accepted.

Page 11 of 12

The accused-appellant giving evidence denied any involvement to the

offence described in the first charge. However, for the reasons stated

above, his denial creates no reasonable doubt regarding the prosecution

case. Hence, although the learned High Court Judges reasoning is not

so detailed, his conclusion to reject the defence version is correct.

As stated previously, it is established from the evidence of the case that

the money pertaining to the receipts produced through the witnesses

PW-3, PW-16, PW-17 and PW-20 have been misappropriated by the

appellant. Accordingly, the total amount of money misappropriated was

Rs.843,000/-. Therefore, I hold that the learned High Court Judges

decision to convict the appellant for dishonest misappropriation of

public property (1st charge) is correct. However, the prosecution has

proved only Rs.843,000/- misappropriated by the appellant. However,

as this Court also finds that the dishonest misappropriation is

established beyond a reasonable doubt, for the reasons stated above, I

find no reason to interfere with the conviction entered by the learned

High Court Judge. Accordingly, the conviction of the learned High Court

Judge is affirmed. In his submissions, the learned Presidents Counsel

for the appellant challenged only the conviction but not the sentence.

As the sentence of 10 years imprisonment is lawful and reasonable, I

hold that the said sentence of imprisonment should remain as it is.

According to Section 5(1) of the Offences Against Public Property Act,

the fine should be three times the value of the property in respect of

which such offence was committed. Therefore, the fine that could be

imposed on the accused-appellant would be Rs.2,529,000/-.

Accordingly, the fine imposed by the learned High Court Judge is

reduced to Rs. 2,529,000/- as the proved amount of misappropriation

is Rs.843,000/-. In default of paying the said fine, the appellant is

sentenced to 6 years of simple imprisonment.

Page 12 of 12

The conviction and the sentence of 10 years imprisonment imposed on

the accused-appellant are affirmed. Subject to the aforesaid variation

in respect of the fine and default sentence, the appeal is dismissed.
