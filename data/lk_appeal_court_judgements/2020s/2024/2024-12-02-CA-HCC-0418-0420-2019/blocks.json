Based on the contents of such statements, the attention of the Court has been drawn to about 30 omissions therein. Some of the omissions are with regard to the number of people who were present at the scene during the incident of assaulting the deceased and PW-03. Such omissions brought to the attention of Court indicate the fact that PW-01 and PW-03 in their statements have mentioned that only three persons had been present at the scene of the incident. Further, the credibility of PW-01 and PW-03 have been challenged in the proceedings before the High Court. The chances of upsetting their testimony will be increased by the passage of time. It is also noted that 20 years have lapsed since the commission of the offences. Further, the appellants have defended themselves in two long drawn out trials and it does not seem just to call upon them to defend themselves for a third time after an unconscionable lapse of time.",
