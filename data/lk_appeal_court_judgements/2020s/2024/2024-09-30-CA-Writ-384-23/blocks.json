The Petitioner, a politician in the District of Kandy was a member of the Provincial Council and held the position of Chairman of the Provincial Council. Subsequently, the Petitioner was charged in the High Court of Kandy for election related violence under the Penal Code and Parliamentary Elections Act, No. 1 of 1980, and was convicted for a period of two years and six months. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeal affirmed the conviction of the Petitioner but considering the duration of the case, the Appellant not having any previous convictions and his advanced age, reduced the Petitioners sentence to two years and suspended the same for five years. The Petitioner contends that following the conviction, he had been removed from office in March 2015 and from that day he had been deprived of his salary. It was contended that his sentence was varied in appeal by reducing it to two years and suspended for five years. Accordingly, the Petitioner contends that he is entitled to his salary for the remainder of the term he was elected to the Provincial Council. Thus, this writ Application.",

Upon inquiry by Court both Counsel submitted that upon the Petitioner being disqualified, the Central Provincial Council had elected a new Chairman for the remainder of the tenure. It was conceded by all the Counsel that the so-elected Chairman under Section 7 can nevertheless hold the Chairmans position until the election of the next Council. Upon further inquiry by the Court, it was submitted that this procedure had been followed and a new Chairman has been elected and the provision of Section 7(3) is now in force. If that is so, the Petitioner has not sought this Court to quash that appointment. In the absence of quashing the said appointment there cannot be a vacancy for the post of the Chairman in the Provincial Council.
