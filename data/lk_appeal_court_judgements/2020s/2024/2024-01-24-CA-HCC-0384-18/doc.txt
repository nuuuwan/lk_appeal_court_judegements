Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

The accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the appellant) was indicted

before the High Court of Gampaha, for causing the death of one Sirisena Perera

alias Victor on 28th December 1993, at a place called Weliweriya within the

jurisdiction of the High Court of Gampaha, and thereby committing the offence

of murder punishable in terms of section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial without a jury, the appellant was found guilty as charged of the

judgement dated 25-10-2018 by the learned High Court Judge of Gampaha and

accordingly, he was sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred

this appeal.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following ground of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. Whether the prosecution has proved the case against the appellant

beyond reasonable doubt.

Page 3 of 6

However, having formulated the said ground of appeal, the learned Counsel for

the appellant conceded that he has no basis to challenge the judgement of the

learned High Court Judge as it is a judgement pronounced after having well

considered the evidence placed before the Court, the relevant law, and other

attendant circumstances.

The learned Additional Solicitor General (ASG) who represented the respondent

made submissions bringing to the notice of the Court, the evidence led before

the trial Court and the fact that the appellant in his dock statement has admitted

the incident. She pointed out that the learned High Court Judge has well

considered whether the evidence led by the prosecution has proved the charge

beyond reasonable doubt, and also whether there was any basis to consider the

incident in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code. It was her position that there

exists no basis whatsoever to allow this appeal.

The evidence led at the trial discloses the fact that the deceased and the appellant

are relatives. Both of them had been fishmongers. It appears that the deceased

has opposed the appellant engaging in selling fish near the place where the

deceased used to sell fish over a long period of time.

The sole eyewitness (PW-01) to the incident had been deceased when this matter

was taken up for trial. However, the prosecution has led the deposition he made

during the non-summary proceedings before the Magistrates Court in terms of

section 33 of the Evidence Ordinance. It is clear from the Magistrates Court

proceedings that the appellant had been represented by an Attorney-at-Law, and

PW-01 had been duly cross-examined.

The evidence of the wife of the deceased establishes the fact that after coming

home for the day, the deceased had left the house around 6.00 6.30 in the

afternoon to go to a neighbours house to watch Television. The incident had

occurred while the deceased was walking on the main road.

According to the deposition made by the eyewitness PW-01, while he was in a

shop near the main road, he has heard someone pleading and has

Page 4 of 6

seen the deceased being chased by the appellant. The PW-01 has seen the

appellant having a manna knife in his hand and attacking the deceased who fell

on the ground.

After the arrest of the appellant, the said manna knife had been recovered based

on a statement made by the appellant in terms of section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

The Government Analyst had identified human blood on the manna knife

recovered upon the statement of the appellant, and sent before him for analysis.

According to the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO), there had been

8 cut injuries on the body of the deceased. The fatal cut injury had been to the

head, and the JMO has expressed the opinion that the said injuries can be

caused by a heavy sharp weapon and the manna knife marked P-2 can be used

to cause such injuries.

When called for a defence at the conclusion of the prosecution evidence, the

appellant has made a dock statement. In his dock statement, he has stated that

the deceased was his fathers younger brother and he used to sell fish near

Weliweriya junction for some time, and he too started selling fish near the same

place which resulted in an animosity between them.

He has claimed that on the date of the incident, there was a verbal altercation

with the deceased around 8.30 in the night and after that the deceased went to

a nearby shop and came with a manna knife to attack him. After grappling with

him, he managed to take the manna knife from his hand and because of the

anger, he attacked the deceased using the same manna knife.

Since the appellant had admitted causing injuries to the deceased, the learned

High Court Judge has very correctly considered whether whose version can be

believed as to the way the incident has occurred. The deposition of the sole

eyewitness has been considered having in his mind, the inherent weaknesses of

such a witness as his deposition, although he has been cross-examined at the

Page 5 of 6

non-summary inquiry, he was not before the trial Court to give the evidence and

to face the test of cross-examination.

The learned High Court Judge has considered whether the actions of the

deceased were a result of exercising his right of private defence. After having

considered the evidence made available to the trial Court, it has been determined

that there was no basis to come to such a conclusion.

Thereafter, the learned High Court Judge has considered whether the action of

the appellant would fall under the exceptions for murder as provided in section

294 of the Penal Code.

The learned High Court Judge has well considered whether the incident would

fall under exception 01, where grave and sudden provocation is applicable, and

exception 04, where sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel

shall become applicable.

Although the appellant has claimed of a sudden fight and provocation, there was

no evidence before the trial Court to substantiate such a fact. The PW-01 has

seen the deceased being chased by the appellant and him pleading for his life

saying not to attack. Despite this, the appellant has attacked him and has

caused serious cut injuries using a manna knife which shows that the appellant

had the clear intention and the knowledge of causing the death of the deceased.

Even though the motive is not an essential requirement to prove in a charge of

this nature, the evidence clearly shows that because of the deceaseds objections

for the appellant having a fish stall near his one, has contributed to this attack

on the deceased.

It needs to be noted that it is the same Judge who heard the entirety of the

evidence has pronounced the judgement. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that

the learned trial Judge had the advantage of hearing the evidence in its entirety

and observing the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses.

In the case of Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 SLR 119, G. P. S. De

Silva, J. (As he was then) reiterated that the Court of Appeal would not likely

disturb the findings of primary facts made by a trial Judge unless it is manifestly

wrong as they have the priceless advantage of observing the demeanour of

witnesses which the Judges of the Court of Appeal does not have.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the sole ground of appeal

urged by the appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. The conviction and the sentence affirmed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

P. Kumararatnam, J.

I agree.
