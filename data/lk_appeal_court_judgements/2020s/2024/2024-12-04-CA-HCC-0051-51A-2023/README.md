K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J

COUNSEL : Nihara Randeniya for the 2nd Accused-Appellant.

ARGUED ON : 30.10.2024

DECIDED ON : 04.12.2024

K.M.G.H. KULATUNGA, J. 1. The 2nd and 4th accused-appellants along with three other accused were

indicted before the High Court of Colombo for committing robbery, on

27.11.1997 punishable under the Firearms Ordinance No. 33 of 1916,

Page 3 of 9

as amended, read with the section 383 of the Penal Code. The High

Court trial proceeded in absentia against the 1st accused under s.241

of the Criminal Procedure Code and the 5th accused died during the

pendency of the trial. The learned trial judge did not call for the defense

in respect of charges 3, 5, and 7 owing to the lack of evidence and also

concluded that there was no prima facie case made out under the

Firearms Ordinance and proceeded to call for the defence only under

the Penal Code offences. The 3rd accused was acquitted for want of

evidence and the defence was called for from the 2nd and 4th accused-

Appellants. Upon calling the defence, the 2nd and 4th accused were

convicted of counts 6 and 8, and were acquitted of counts 1, 2, and 4.

2. The trial judge sentenced the 2nd and 4th accused-appellants to life

imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 20,000/- with a default

sentence of nine months imprisonment for non-payment of the fines

for each of the counts 6 and 8 separately to each of the appellants.

These appeals are preferred against the Judgment dated 16.01.2023.

3. The 2nd and 4th accused-appellants preferred two separate appeals

bearing number 51/2023 and 51A/2023 respectively, against the

convictions as well as the sentences. However, when these appeals were

taken up for argument, Mr. Nihara Randeniya, AAL for the 2nd accused-

appellant, and Mr. Sachithra Harshana, AAL for the 4th accused-

appellant informed that they are only pursuing with the appeals against

the sentences and that they are abandoning the appeals against the

convictions. Accordingly, both these matters will be taken up and

considered together and this judgement will bind them both the

appeals.

Facts

4. The Accused appellants were initially indicted for being members of

an unlawful assembly and committing robbery of Rs. 7,500/- from

the possession of Champika Gunasekara, a gold necklace worth Rs.

11,000/- from Kuttan Dharmaraja and another necklace worth Rs.

4,800/- from Basthiram Pedige Upali Somawera, using a pistol and

a knife.

5. The prosecution called several witnesses to support its case.

Witnesses included (2) Champika, a sales assistant at the boutique

named "Kandy Sweet"; (3) Dharmarajah, a bystander; (4) Upali, an

employee of the sweet factory; (5) Gunapala, another employee; (7)

Dammika, the cashier of the boutique; and (16) N.P. Wijekoon, (17)

Shani Abeysekara, and (19) Gamini Keerthiratne, Police Officers,

among others. Exhibits presented included statements admitted

under Section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance, gold pieces, and notes

from an identification parade held on 06.01.1998.

The Incident

6. The incident occurred on 27.11.1997 at approximately 4:30 PM at

the Kandy Sweet boutique in Sedawatta. The premises consisted of

three small buildings: the boutique, a sweet factory, and a house.

Champika testified that four individuals were loitering outside the

boutique and, upon being questioned, stated they were waiting for

the owner. Shortly after, one of the accused pointed a knife at her,

while another held a pistol to her head and demanded the cashier

drawer be opened. They then robbed Rs. 7,500/- and her necklace.

Other witnesses corroborated Champikas testimony, describing the

groups coordinated actions during the robbery.

7. Police officers testified about their investigations, arrests, and the

identification parade conducted within two months of the incident.

Witnesses identified the accused during the parade as the

perpetrators.

Page 5 of 9

8. Both the appellant and the 4th accused made dock statements. The

appellant claimed he was arrested near Grandpass in December

1997, taken to the sweet factory, and shown to prosecution

witnesses before being produced at the identification parade. The

defense did not challenge this during cross-examination of the police

witnesses or raise objections during the trial.

9. The main argument advanced is that when the defence was called at

the Section 200 stage, the learned Trial Judge had specifically come

to a finding that the use of a firearm had not been proved and as

such, the charges under the Firearms Ordinance does not have be

considered. Accordingly. The defence has been called for counts 1, 2,

and 4, and the corresponding counts 6 and 8, limited to the Penal

Code offences.

10. Upon calling the defence, the learned Trial Judge had finally

convicted the 2nd and the 4th accused only in respect of counts 6 and

8 of the indictment. According to the judgement dated 16.01.2023,

the 2nd and 4th accused have been convicted for counts 6 and 8 but

there is no reference to the Firearms Ordinance. At the

commencement of the judgement, the charges as originally framed

with reference to Section 44 (a) of the Firearms Ordinance had been

mentioned. Though the defence was called for only in respect of the

Penal Code offences the trial judge has convicted the 2nd and the 4th

accused for counts 4 and 6 of the indictment that is framed under

Section 44(a) of the Firearms Ordinance. However, through calling of

the defence and according to the body and reasoning of the

judgement it is apparent and obvious that the Trial Judge has

intended to convict the accused-appellants for the lesser offences

under Section 383 of the Penal Code, read with Section 32. This has

not been specifically stated so when the convictions were entered as

stated in the Judgment. The learned Senior State Counsel conceded

this fact. Accordingly, the said portion of the judgement, is varied to

Page 6 of 9

read as follows; That the 2nd and the 4th accused are separately

convicted for the lesser offence of counts 6 and 8 being the

offence of robbery committed under the Section 383 of the Penal

Code read with Section 32.

Sentence

11. Now, it is to consider the sentences. Both the appellants Counsel and

the learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the sentence of life

imprisonment cannot be maintained and a suitable sentence under

Section 383 of the Penal Code should be substituted accordingly.

12. The learned Trial Judge has by his order dated 16.01.2023, upon

hearing the counsel on sentencing, imposed life imprisonment in

respect of each count for both the appellants separately, and also, a

fine of Rs. 20,000.00 each in addition thereto, with a default term of

nine months each.

13. As the conviction is now varied to offences punishable under Section

383 of the Penal Code, the maximum sentence prescribed by Section

383 is 20 years imprisonment. This is on the basis of using knives to

commit robbery. I will now advert to the relevant facts in respect of

each of the appellants has evident from the record. These offences

have been committed in 1997. The appellants had been indicted in

2004. After a long-drawn-out trial, the appellants have been convicted

and sentenced on 16.01.2023. Accordingly, the accused-appellants

have been convicted after the lapse of 16 years and since 16.01.2023,

both of them have been in remand pending the appeals. If I may

consider the nature of the offending, these two appellants along with

several others have entered into a business premises where a

confectionary manufacturing business was being run by the

complainant, having so entered and been armed robbed cash and gold

jewellery from those who were employed there as well as from the

cashier. This clearly has been a pre-planned and pre-meditated crime

Page 7 of 9

committed for profit. It is also relevant to note that the victims have

been vulnerable as they were engaged in employment in a shop where

public has access for business purposes. This robbery has been

committed around 4:00 PM. Entering into a premises of another with

impunity in this manner is extremely serious and high handed to say

the least. They were armed. The seriousness is amply reflected by the

maximum sentence prescribed under Section 383 of the Penal Code

which is 20 years imprisonment. The very manner of the executing of

this crime with impunity is serious and demands a considerable

sentence to be imposed from the point of view of the society. As stated

above, this strikes at the very heart of the society, its commercial

activities and creates a great degree of insecurity. However, I am

mindful of the fact that this criminal trial has been hanging over the

head of these appellants for 17 years, which by itself constitutes some

form of punishments. Considering all these facts, this Court is under

a duty to impose a sentence which is commensurate with the

seriousness of the offence.

14. As for the personal circumstances, the 2nd accused-appellant is

around 46 years and claims that he does not have any previous

convictions. He is said to be a father of a 13-year-old child and

appears to have been employed as a driver. Similarly, the 4th accused-

appellant is around 44 years of age without any similar previous

convictions. He is a father of two children around 21 and 18 years. He

also appears to have been employed as a labourer. This information

was extracted from the submissions made by their Counsels prior to

sentencing on 16.10.2023.

15. In determining an appropriate sentence, the Court is required to

consider the sentences from the point of view of society and the public

as well as the accused-appellants. As the facts clearly demand a

considerable sentence on the one hand the fact that sentencing is now

considered after 18 years is also a relevant fact, of which I am mindful.

Page 8 of 9

It appears that the accused-appellants have reached their middle ages

and settling down to a way of peaceful life when they were sentenced

in 2023. Considering all the above said facts and circumstances, we

sentence the accused-appellants as follows;

i. Each of the accused-appellants are imposed with sentences of

04 years rigorous imprisonment for 04th and 06th counts

separately.

ii. In addition thereto, each of the appellants is also ordered to

pay a sum of Rs. 12,500.00 as compensation to PW-3, Kuttan

Dharmaraja in respect of count No. 04; and also, ordered to

pay a sum of Rs. 12,500.00 as compensation to PW-1,

Munasinghe Pathirage Ariyadasa, in respect of count No.06.

iii. If the payment of the said compensation is defaulted, it is to

be recovered as a fine and in default thereof further one-years

imprisonment is ordered in respect of each count separately.

iv. The jail terms ordered in respect of counts 04 and 06 against

both the accused-appellants is ordered to run concurrently.

Accordingly, the aggregate sentence would be 04 years.

16. Having so determined the sentence, I observed that the accused-

appellants have been in remand pending appeal from the date of

conviction and sentence i.e. 16.01.2023. Thus, it is now necessary

act under proviso to Section 333(5) of the Criminal Procedure Act as

amended by Act No. 25 of 2024. Said provision reads as follows;

Provided that, the Court of Appeal may, in appropriate cases, order

that the time spent by an appellant in custody pending the

determination of his appeal and any time spent in custody prior to

the conviction, such time not having been considered as part of his

sentence passed at the time of his conviction by the court of first

instance, be considered as part of his sentence ordered at the

conclusion of his appeal.

Page 9 of 9

17. According to which the Court of Appeal is vested with a discretion to

consider the time spent in remand pending the appeal as well as time

spent in custody prior to the conviction as being a part of the sentence

ordered.

18. On the perusal of the record and the brief, I am unable to ascertain the

pre conviction periods of remand of the appellants. However, upon the

conviction the appellants have been in remand for one year, ten months

and seventeen days up until today. Accordingly, I would consider a

period of two years as being the period in custody both pre and post-

conviction. Accordingly, said period of two years will be considered as a

part of the sentence which will be given credit to. Accordingly, the final

aggregate sentences of each of the accused-appellants will be two years

rigorous imprisonment.

19. Accordingly, the appeals are partially allowed.
