Introduction

1. The accused-appellant was convicted by the High Court Judge of

Gampaha for committing grave sexual abuse of a 15-year-old girl

on or about 17th of November, 2010, punishable under Section

365B (2)(b) of the Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995.

Then the accused-appellant (who hereinafter is also referred to as

the appellant) was sentenced to nine years' rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 25,000/- and a six-months

default sentence, and also ordered to pay Rs. 100,000/- as

compensation to the victim, with one years default sentence.

Aggrieved with the conviction and dissatisfied with the sentence

the appellant has now preferred this appeal.

Facts

2. The appellant was a known neighbour of around 19 years of age

and the prosecutrix was around 15 years at the time of the

incident. The appellant happened to visit the victims house,

around 2:00 PM, whilst her parents were in the paddy field and

her grandfather was napping. The victim and her younger sister

Page 3 of 14

were in the front porch, where the appellant joined them for a

chat.

3. Hearing the telephone ring inside the house, the victim had gone

to answer it. The appellant has followed her in, grabbed her and

forced her into a bedroom, thrown her onto a bed and closed the

door. Then the appellant has covered her mouth while touching

her breasts and genital area. The victims muffled screams have

alerted her grandfather who then knocked on the door, prompting

the appellant to flee by jumping over the room wall (the gap

between the roof and the top end of the wall no ceiling). The

victim disclosed the incident to her parents upon their return.

They first visited the appellant's parents before reporting the

matter to the police on the same day.

4. The Police inter alia recorded a statement from the victims 70-

year-old grandfather, but he passed away before the trial

commenced. The evidence presented included testimony of PW-

01 the victim, PW-02 her mother, PW-05 the investigating officer

and PW-06 the Judicial Medical Officer, the pathologist.

5. Upon the defence being called, the appellant made a dock

statement and called his mother to testify on his behalf. The

appellant in his dock statement denied the allegations but

admitted visiting the victims house and chatting with her and

said that the contradictions in the prosecution's evidence

undermined the case against him.

Grounds of Appeal

6. The grounds of appeal pleaded are;

1. that the learned trial judge has failed to properly evaluate

the probability of the prosecution' case;

2. that the learned trial judge has failed to evaluate the inter

se and per se contradictions in the prosecution's case;

Page 4 of 14

3. that the learned trial judge failed to properly evaluate the

evidence;

4. that the learned trial judge erroneously believed the

evidence of the investigation officer (PW-05); and

5. that the learned trial judge misdirected himself as regards

to the evaluation of the defence case.

Consideration of the grounds of appeal

7. The 1st - 4th grounds of appeal relate to credibility and the

evaluation of the evidence and will be considered together. At this

juncture, it is relevant to note that the trial judge who finally

determined this matter succeeded to his predecessor after the

close of the prosecutions case. Except for the defence evidence

and the cross-examination of the investigating officer PW-05, the

trial judge did not have the opportunity to see the demeanour and

deportment of the prosecution witnesses. Therefore, the trial

judge himself was limited to the other tests, namely, probability

and improbability, and consistency and inconsistency, in

determining the veracity and the credibility. The trial judge has

quite rightly made no reference to the demeanour and

deportment but applied the other tests.

Improbability

8. It was the argument of the appellant that the trial judge has failed

to apply the test of probability and improbability in its proper

perspective to the evidence of PW-01 the prosecutrix. The sum

total of this argument is that the trial judge failed to appreciate

the improbability of the victims story. The credibility of a witness

may be impugned by employing the test of probability and

improbability, consistency and inconsistency, interestedness and

disinterestedness and spontaneity and belatedness

(Wickramasuriya vs. Dedoleena and others-(1996) 2 Sri LR

954). Improbability directly affects the credibility.

Page 5 of 14

9. That being so, the argument advanced is that PW-01s

version of how the appellant escaped is improbable. PW-01

states that the appellant stepped on to the ironing board,

scaled the wall, jumped to the sitting area, and escaped. It

is submitted that the Police witness said that the height of

the wall was approximately 14 feet, and the Police Officer

also had not observed any footprints on the wall. It is thus

submitted that even if the ironing board is 3 feet tall, it is

not possible for a person to scale a wall of 14 feet. Even

if he had done so, one would expect some injury to have

been caused to the appellant if he leaped 14 feet. Thus,

it is the submission that the version of PW-01 is improbable

and that this had escaped the attention of the trial judge.

10. The evidence of PW-05, IP Kanchana, the Police witness as to the

height is as follows:

:

?

: . 10 .

: ?

: .

: ?

: .

: 12 15 ?

: 15 . 05 .

10 .

: 15 . 14 , 13 , 13 ?

: .

11. In her estimation, it was 10 feet. Then, the defence questions, if

it could be 15 feet, which the witness clearly denies and says it

could not be. Then, it is followed by the suggestive question if the

height could be 13, 13 or 14 feet. Her answer was that it

Page 6 of 14

sometimes may probably be. It is from this evidence that the

appellants counsel advanced the above argument of improbability

based on the premise that the evidence has proved that the height

is 14 feet and thus it is not possible to scale that wall. In PW-

05s emphatic position is that the height is 10 feet. The appellant

in his dock statement does not refer to this in any form. Thus, on

a consideration of the totality of the evidence there is no

improbability.

12. At pages 28 and 29 of the judgement, this aspect has been

considered by the trial judge. The trial judge has clearly come to a

correct conclusion, considering the evidence. Therefore, this

ground of improbability of PW-01s evidence is misconceived and

is devoid of any merit.

Contradictions and omissions

13. It is submitted that the trial judge failed to evaluate vital

contradictions in the evidence of PW-01. The argument is that the

charge is about the touching the vagina of PW-01. However, in her

evidence she had admitted that her vagina was touched over the

clothing (panty) (Page 69 of the appeal brief). The failure to

mention in the statement that the touching was over the

clothing/undergarment was raised as an omission.

14. Then not stating in the police statement, the touching of the

breasts and the failure to mention the touching of the genitalia

was over the clothing, appear to be omissions in that it is not

stated directly in that form in the statement. At the point of

making the statement, these are additional and consequential

factors as far as the main complaint of touching the genitalia is

concerned. Therefore, the failure to mention the abovesaid is quite

probable for the simple reason that when a young girl of 15 years

is required to narrate an incident of a very personal nature, which

necessarily involves reference to genitalia, unpleasant and

Page 7 of 14

embarrassing descriptions of events and acts one cannot expect

in the backdrop of our culture, society and social norms, to

narrate every incidental act and detail freely. A victim of sexual

violence will be naturally inclined to say what is necessary and

only the bare minimum. This is especially so when a victim had

been traumatized by such event.

15. The act of touching the female genitalia of a child aged 15 years is

the offending act, as to whether the clothing was removed or not

touching the female genitalia, would not make any difference to

the act of sexual abuse as alleged in the charge. It would certainly

fall within the definition of the offence under Section 365B of the

Penal Code.

16. Considering a similar issue in Regina vs. H (2005) 1 WLR 2005,

the Court of Appeal whilst interpreting the word touching

contained in Section 3 of the Sexual Offences Act, 2003 as in force

in U.K, observed that the touching of clothing would constitute

touching for the purpose of said Section 3. Thus, a lack of skin-

to-skin contact alone does not as a matter in proving this offence.

17. If at all, the relevance is in respect of the credibility and

consistency. This was a momentary act which the child was

resisting. If the hand was put in or if it was over the garments is

a matter of detail which in such circumstances may be difficult to

recall after several years.

18. The next is the contradiction where in cross-examination, she

had admitted that the incident took place in her room. However,

in her statement she had stated it to be the room she, her mother,

and her sister usually sleep. I see absolutely no contradiction here

for the simple reason that this happens to be the room where she

sleeps may be with others. However, for all purposes that room

being referred to as her room is another way of describing the

Page 8 of 14

same thing as said to the Police. I see no appreciable contradiction

here.

19. Then it was submitted that though the victim alleges there was a

scuffle, the absence of any injuries throws a doubt as to the

truthfulness. Then, it was submitted that whilst PW-01 said there

was no door in the front except the door frame, the Police Officer

had said that the front door was open. Then, it was submitted

whilst PW-01 said that the room door was locked, and the Police

Officer had not noticed such a lock on the door. The learned trial

judge was considered these contradictions and omissions and

concluded that they were not significant and relevant as they do

not go to the root of the evidence or the core of the prosecutions

case. These are not significant and are of trivial nature. As regard

the existence or the non-existence of the door lock, it is just that

the Police Officer had not made a positive observation as to the

presence of the door lock. This does not mean that there was no

lock, it only means that the Police Officer had not made a

conscious observation as to the existence or otherwise of the lock.

Therefore, I see no merit in the above ground of appeal.

20. The 03rd ground of appeal is that the acceptance of the evidence

of the PW-05, the Police Officer is erroneous, as regards the arrest

of the accused. PW-05 claims that she arrested the accused at a

junction along a road. However, the fact that she had not carried

hand-cuffs or a weapon, bringing him back to the Police Station

by bus without buying a ticket and the absence of an out entry

makes her evidence suspicious and not credible. It is also

submitted that there is a contradiction as to the mode of transport

employed to take victim to the hospital. Considering this

submission, it is apparent that there are some contradictions

which does not impact upon the totality of the prosecution case.

The fact that the investigation was conducted by this witness, the

Page 9 of 14

victim was taken to a doctor and the arrest of the accused are

common ground. This evidence does not impact upon the

credibility to any appreciable degree. Finally, it was argued that

the MLR tendered to Court contains a wrong date on which the

doctor has admitted, and also the absence of the opinion of the

doctor. These are trivial mistakes which have been explained and

is of such a nature that can create no impact to the credibility or

the admissibility of the medical evidence.

21. F. N. D. Jayasuriya, J., in Wickremasuriya v. Dedoleena and

Others (1996) 2 Sri L.R. considered and evaluated the nature,

effect and import of contractions and held that,

i. After a considerable lapse of time, as has resulted on

this application, it is customary to come across

contradictions in the testimony of witnesses. This is a

characteristic feature of human testimony which is full

of infirmities and weaknesses especially when

proceedings are held long after the events spoken to

by witnesses; a judge must expect such contradictions

to exist in the testimony. The issue is whether the

contradiction or inconsistency goes to the root of the

case or relates to the core of a party's case. If the

contradiction is not of that character, the court ought

to accept the evidence of witnesses whose evidence is

otherwise cogent, having regard to the Test of

Probability and Improbability and having regard to the

demeanour and deportment manifested by witnesses.

ii. The corte issue is whether the contradiction or

inconsistency goes to the root of the case or relates to

the core of a party's case. If the contradiction is not of

that character, the court ought to accept the evidence

of witnesses whose evidence is otherwise cogent,

having regard to the Test of Probability and

Page 10 of 14

Improbability and having regard to the demeanour

and deportment manifested by witnesses. Trivial

contradictions which do not touch the core of a partys

case should not be given much significance, specially

when the probabilities factor echoes in favour of the

version narrated by an applicant. Justice Thaaker in

his judgment in Barwada Boginbhai Hirjibhai v.

the State of Gujerat, (1983 A1R 753 at 755.)

remarks: Discrepancies which do not go to the root of

the matter or to the core of a partys case and shake

the basic version of the witness cannot be given too

much importance. More so, when the all important

probabilities factor echoes in favour of the version

narrated by the witness.

22. I regret to note that the appellant has resorted to raising

extremely trivial differences and omissions to assail and challenge

the evidence of PW-01. As held time and again, evidence of

witnesses is susceptible to variations due to natural human

frailties of loss of memory and lapse of time. In such

circumstances, when such differences and omissions are

insignificant and especially when the probabilities factor echoes

in favour of the version narrated by the witnesses as in this case

the court can act on such evidence. As to the contradictions and

omissions, which I have already considered, they are broadly two

omissions and one contradiction. At pages 16 and 23 of the

judgement, these contradictions and omissions have been

sufficiently considered. To that extent, the learned trial judge has

adverted his mind to the same. Accordingly, as for this ground of

appeal, I see no merit and the same is thus rejected.

Page 11 of 14

Failure to evaluate the defence case.

23. As for the failure to evaluate the defence case, the main argument

is that the dock statement had not been properly analysed and

evaluated in the proper perspective. As for the dock statement it

is now settled law that a judge should in evaluating a dock

consider the following principles:

i. If the dock statement is believed it must be acted

upon;

ii. If the dock statement creates a reasonable doubt in

the prosecution case the defence must succeed;

iii. If the dock statement cannot be accepted or rejected

the defence must succeed [Queen vs. Kularatne (71

NLR page 529)].

24. The trial judge in this case, at pages 32 35 of the judgement has

extensively considered and evaluated the dock statement and the

defence evidence. The dock statement is rejected on the basis that

it is not truthful, as it is not probable and is inconsistent with

previous positions suggested to the witnesses. Then the trial judge

also has observed that the said dock statement and the evidence

of the defence do not create any dent or doubt in the prosecution

case and evidence. The finding of untruthfulness is based on the

inconsistency and contradictions arising out of the dock

statement and the improbability of the defence version. The

improbability is that, in one breath, the appellant claims that

there was a love affair between them. In the same breath it is

alleged for the prosecutrix to have made a false allegation of sexual

abuse by touching her genitalia. In the normal course of human

conduct, if a girl was merely seen in a room with a boy and was

called upon to explain her conduct, would she fabricate a

narrative alleging the touching of her genitalia? I think not, and

in all probability, she would deny any conduct of a sexual nature

even if it had so happened. The appellants version is that when

Page 12 of 14

the grandfather came, the appellant claims to have merely walked

out, and no physical contact took place between him and PW-01.

If that be so, the victim had no reason to fabricate a physical act

of a sexual nature to explain her conduct of being alone in the

room when no one has seen anything happen.

25. It is unimaginable that a young girl in our society would concoct

an untruthful story and level charges of sexual assault for the

purposes of animosity or revenge, or to that matter as an excuse

for being seen in solitude with her lover. The stigma that attaches

to the victim of sexual offence in our society ordinarily rules out

the levelling of false accusations of a sexual nature. Ours is a

conservative society, and therefore, a girl, and more so a young

girl, will not put her reputation at peril by alleging falsely of an act

of a sexual nature. Moreover, no parent would normally take the

risk of tarnishing the image of their daughter by making a false

allegation of sexual nature against a person. This is the reality,

and victims are more prone to conceal and suffer in silence rather

than to complain and risk undue publicity and social stigma.

26. Therefore, the version of the appellant is inherently improbable.

To cap it all, the existence of a love affair had not been suggested

to the prosecutrix either. Therefore, the so-called love affair is

more of an afterthought and a false position which the appellant

has taken up at the end of the trial. In these circumstances, the

trial judges finding that the dock statement is untruthful and the

decision to reject the dock statement, is, in accordance with the

evidence, reasonable and correct.

The sentence

27. Now to consider if the sentence is excessive as alleged by the

appellant. Sentence imposed is 9 years rigorous imprisonment, a

fine of Rs. 25,000/- and compensation in a sum of Rs. 100,000/-

with default terms of six months and one year respectively. The

Page 13 of 14

sentence prescribed by section 365B (2)(b) is rigorous

imprisonment for a term not less than seven years and not

exceeding twenty years and a fine and also compensation. The

maximum penalty of twenty years that the legislature has set for

this offence is a reflection of the communitys abhorrence of and

concern towards sexual abuse of children. Certainly, general

deterrence is of great importance in offences involving acts of

significant sexual abuse and exploitation against children.

Moreover, the legislature has provided for increased penalties in

respect of many such offences; it is to protect children from abuse

and exploitation and to deter others from acting in a similar

manner.

28. The appellant submits that in considering the sentence, the trial

judge has presumed a probability of an act of rape taking place,

which has caused some prejudice to the appellant in determining

the sentence. It is correct that, at page 03 of the sentencing order,

the trial judge has in fact opined that the possibility of a more

serious offence being committed was averted by the arrival of the

grandfather. The learned judge states that if not for the timely

arrival of the grandfather, the victim may have even been raped.

The trial judge had, in fact, specifically stated that he would take

this matter into consideration in determining the sentence. Then,

he had also referred to several judgements pertaining to

sentencing in rape cases. Accordingly, it is apparent that the trial

judge has been of the mindset that the appellant has attempted to

rape the victim, and the determination of the sentence has to some

extent been coloured and affected. In these circumstances, I am

satisfied that prejudice has been caused to the appellant in

determining and quantifying the substantial jail term of the

sentence. Accordingly, the jail term imposed is varied to five years

rigorous imprisonment.

Page 14 of 14

Conclusion.

29. For the aforementioned reasons, I hold that there is no merit in

this appeal against the conviction. Accordingly affirm the

conviction. However, as the sentence is excessive, the sentence of

the accused-appellant is varied. The 9-year term of rigorous

imprisonment imposed is altered and varied to 5 years rigorous

imprisonment. Subject to this variation made to the substantive

term of imprisonment, the fine and the compensation ordered, and

the default terms are affirmed.

30. Accordingly, the appeal against the conviction is dismissed,

however the appeal against the sentence is partially allowed.

The appeal is partially allowed.
