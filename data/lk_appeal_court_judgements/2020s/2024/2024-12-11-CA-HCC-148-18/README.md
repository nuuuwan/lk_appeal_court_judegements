MENAKA WIJESUNDERA J.

The instant appeal has been filed to set aside the judgement dated 29/06/2018

of the High Court of Colombo.

The accused-appellant, hereinafter referred to as the appellant, has been

indicted for the possession and trafficking of 2.18 grams of heroin. At the end

of the trial the appellant had been convicted for both. The appellant being

aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence had preferred the instant appeal.

The following grounds of appeal were raised by the appellant,

1. The trial judge not considering the improbability of the prosecution story

3

2. Contradictions in the evidence of PW-01 and PW-02 not being considered

by the trial judge

3. Inward journey of the productions not being considered by the trial judge

4. The pink colour covering which contained the four parcels of heroin not

being produced as a production by the prosecution.

5. The trial judge deciding the merits of the case before considering the

defence.

6. Dock statement of the appellant not being considered by the trial judge.

The main raiding officer that is PW-01 had said in evidence that on the 28th of

December 2010 on an information received he had arranged a group of police

officers to go on a raid pertaining to this case at 1800 hours in a private van,

which belonged to his brother, they had left to the food city at Peliyagoda. The

information they received was that a young boy would come in a red t-shirt.

As they were waiting inside the food city in Peliyagoda, a person in a red t-shirt

had come and they had gone out and PW-01 had searched him. Upon

searching he had found a pink colour bag hidden in his underpants. The said

pink coloured bag had contained two blue coloured parcels and two pink

coloured parcels. They had suspected the substance inside the said bags to be

heroin. As such, the suspect had been arrested and the productions had been

taken into custody. Thereafter, they had gone to the Police Narcotics Bureau at

20:30 and had weighed the productions. Upon weighing the productions, they

had found a gross quantity of 25.510 grams of a substance, which they

suspected to be heroin. The PW-01 had further said that after weighing the

productions, he had put the two pink colour bags and the blue coloured bags

into an envelope and had sealed the same but he had not revealed any

evidence as to the pink colour covering which had the four bags. The said pink

colour covering had not been produced in court as well.

In cross-examination, at page 124-126 of the brief, he had said that the main

the pink coloured covering which had contained the four small bags had not

4

been handed over to the production clerk by him. At 20:30 he had handed over

the envelope which contained the four bags, to PC 81970 Suresh but not the

initial pink coloured covering.

It also has to be noted at this point that PW-01 had not taken into custody any

personal belongings of the appellant.

At this point, the learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the appellant,

brought to the notice of court that it is very improbable that the raiding officers

had not taken any personal belongings of the appellant, who was walking on

the streets and he further said that it further substantiates the position of the

defence that he was taken into custody at home and not while walking on the

streets.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant further raised the issue that

the prosecution failing to mark the initial pink coloured covering, which had

contained the four bags, also raises a doubt with regard to the credibility of the

evidence of PW-01.

Another point raised by the learned counsel for the appellant is that although

PW-01 has spoken of only 1 envelope being used in the sealing of productions,

in the PR book it has been noted as 2 envelopes.

Thereafter, the prosecution has led the evidence of PW-02, who had assisted

PW-01 and has corroborated with PW-01, but he had said that the driver who

drove the van did not have a driving license. This also the learned Presidents

Counsel submitted as a contribution to the improbability of the story of the

prosecution.

He too had been lengthily cross-examined, and it has been suggested to the

witness that he never participated in the raid. This witness too has admitted in

evidence that PW-01, by mistake, had not taken it into custody; the initial pink

covering, which had contained the four bags of narcotics. In the evidence of

PW-02, it has revealed that there was a small white colour paper, which was

5

inserted into the envelope which contained the four bags of heroin. But this is

contrary to the evidence of PW-01.

Thereafter, the prosecution had led the evidence of the Government analyst.

The Government analyst had said that they received the productions on

09.02.2011. At the time of receipt of the production, the seals had been taped.

But at this stage it has to be noted that at page 219 in the brief, the court has

recorded an admission under section 420 of the Criminal Procedure Code that

the defense is not challenging the evidence of PC 86797 Premashantha that

productions were handed over to the Government analyst on 11.02.2009.

The evidence of PC 86797 Premashantha says that he handed over the

productions to the Government analyst on the 9th of January 2011 at 9.30. He

has been cross-examined very lengthily and even in cross-examination he had

said the same thing.

The production registry of the Magistrates Court has recorded the date on

which the productions had been handed over to the Government Analyst as

being the 8th of February, 2011.

Therefore, there are three positions with regard to the receipt of the

productions by the Government analyst.

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that this discrepancy with

regard to the date of handing over of the productions to the Government

analyst in the prosecution case poses a doubt in the credibility of the witnesses

in the case for the prosecution.

Thereafter, the prosecution has taken steps to lead the evidence pertaining to

the chain of productions, which consisted of the evidence of Police constables

Sampath Kumara, Udayanga and Premashantha.

Upon the closure of the prosecution case, the defence had been called and the

appellant has made a statement from the dock, in which he had said that while

6

he was at home a group of police officers had come to his house and had taken

him in a white van and had got his signature on certain documents. Further,

he has completely denied the charge.

Upon the conclusion of the prosecution and the defence, the learned trial judge

had convicted the appellant for both charges and has sentenced accordingly.

The learned counsel for the appellant stated that the trial judge has failed to

consider the above mentioned improbabilities, the contradictions, the

prosecution failing to mark the pink colour bag, which contained the parcels of

heroin and the dock statements of the appellant.

Upon perusal of the judgement, the learned trial judge has considered the fact

that the initial pink covering, which had contained the four parcels of heroin,

not being produced in court, at page 297 of the judgment, but he has

concluded that the mere non production of the said cellophane cover does not

create a doubt in the case of the prosecution.

But it is the opinion of this court that the initial pink covering, which had

contained the four parcels of heroin, is a vital production for the case of the

prosecution. The non production of it creates a doubt with regard to the

witnesses who conducted the raid.

According to the evidence led above there is a discrepancy in the date on which

the productions have been handed over to the Government analyst. But this

too the learned trial judge has considered but has said that it has not caused

any doubt in the case for the prosecution.

But in the opinion of this court, there are three positions with regard to the

date on which the productions have been handed over to the Government

analyst, which is a very important item of evidence in the inward journey of the

productions in the case of the prosecution. If there is no clarity in the date on

which it has been handed over to the Government analyst, it invariably creates

7

a doubt on the case of the prosecution and its credibility with regard to the

witnesses.

We are mindful of the observation made by Justice J.A.N De Silva in Perera v

Attorney General 1998 (1) SLR page 379 held that;

it is a recognized principle that in a case of this nature, the prosecution

must prove that the productions had been forwarded to the Analyst from

proper custody, without allowing room for any suspicion that there had

been no opportunity for tampering or interfering with the production till

they reach the Analyst. Therefore, it is correct to state that the most

important journey is the inwards journey because the final Analyst report

will depend on that. The outward journey does not attract the same

importance.

It was further held by Justice Sisira De Abrew in the case of Witharana Doli

Nona v The Republic of Sri Lanka CA 19/99,

It is a recognized principle in drug related cases the prosecution must

prove the chain relating to the inward journey. The purpose of this

principle is to establish that the productions have not been tampered with.

Prosecution must prove that the productions taken from the accused-

appellant was examined by the Government analyst. To prove this, the

prosecution must prove all the links of the chain from the time it was taken

from the possession of the accused-appellant to the Government Analysts

Department.

Furthermore, the appellant had been arrested according to the prosecution

while riding a motor bike on the road. But his dock statement and his defence

is that he was arrested at home. The raiding officers have failed to take into

custody any item of his personal belongings, which creates a doubt as to

whether he was really arrested at the place that the prosecution witnesses

8

alleged or otherwise. The learned trial judge has completely failed to consider

this possibility.

The counsel for the appellant has also raised the issue that the investigating

officers travelling in a private van with an unlicensed driver is also a great

improbability, which has not crossed the mind of the trial judge. In the

judgment of the trial judge, he has considered this fact but has concluded that

it has not a caused a reasonable doubt in the case of the prosecution.

But it is the opinion of this court that it is highly unlikely that a private van

with an unlicensed driver would be used for a matter of this nature.

In the instant matter, when considering the discrepancies and contradictions

in the prosecution witnesses evidence and the dock statements made by the

appellant, this court would like to direct its attention to the case of James

Silva Vs. Republic of Sri Lanka 1980 (2) SLR 167, where Justice Rodrigo

stated that,

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters before the court adduced whether by the prosecution or by

the defense in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

whether as prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not - see the Privy Council

Judgement in Jayasena vs. Queen 72 NLR 313.

Therefore, upon considering the above mentioned items of evidence and the law

pertaining to the same, it is the considered view of this Court that the

prosecution, which has the sole duty of proving its case beyond a reasonable

doubt, has failed to do so due to the above mentioned discrepancies in the case

for the prosecution.

As such, the conviction and the sentence imposed by the trial judge is hereby

set aside and the instant appeal is allowed.
