JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

This is an application in Revision preferred by the Accused-Petitioner

(Hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) seeking to revise/set aside the

judgment/order dated 08.04.2024 and order dated 16.04.2024 of the

Learned Magistrate of Walasmulla in the case bearing No. 84237 and

the order dated 27.06.2024 of the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle

in the case bearing No. HCRA 11/2024.

The Petitioner was arrested by the officers of the Weeraketiya Police

Station on 07.04.2024 and produced before the learned Magistrate of

Walasmulla on 08.04.2024 on the allegation of possessing 10 grams of

Cannabis Sativa L under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Act. Charge was filed under Section 78(5) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Act in case No. 84237 in the Magistrate Court of

Walasmulla.

The Petitioner, without wasting the time of the court, pleaded guilty to

the charge and the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla had imposed a

fine of Rs.8000/- with a default sentence of 02 months.

As the Petitioner is serving in the Sri Lanka Army for nearly 22 years

and he is due to retire in the end of year 2024, a motion was filed

through his Counsel made an application seeking the said fine

Rs.8000/- be converted as state cost. However, the said application was

refused by the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla on 16.04.2024. In the

order of the learned Magistrate did not entertain the application and

refused the same on the ground that the case had been concluded

already.

Aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla, the

Petitioner had invoked the jurisdiction of the Provincial High of

Southern Province holden at the Tangalle High Court to revise the said

order. The Petitioner had submitted several exceptional circumstances

for the consideration of the High Court. After considering the

submissions made on behalf of the Petitioner, the Leaned High Court

Judge of Tangalle refusing notice to the Respondents, had dismissed

the same on 27.06.2024.

Aggrieved by the above order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Tangalle dated 27.06.2024, the Petitioner had filed this revision

application to revise the orders of the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla

and the order of the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle.

Following exceptional circumstances are urged before this court by the

Petitioner:

a) The Learned High Court Judge and the learned Magistrate has

failed to consider the Judgements in cases bearing No. SC /SPL/

LA 176/2026 dated 27.10.2016 and judgement bearing No. CA

86/2009 dated 15.11.2011 where it was held that a state cost

can be imposed instead of the fine and/ or the same can be done

even when there is a finding of guilt;

b) The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that he is

bound by the Judgments of SC/SPL/LA 176/2026 dated

27.10.2016 and judgment bearing No. CA 86/2009 dated

15.11.2011 wherein he has not even considered the same which

in itself is illegal;

c) The Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate failed

to consider the repercussions or grave prejudice caused to the

Petitioner where he would lose his employment and the benefits

he has earned after serving in the Army inclusive of time of battle;

d) The Learned High Court Judge and the Learned Magistrate failed

to consider the following the above authorities justice would be

met by converting fine of Rs. 8,000/- to a state cost as sought by

the Petitioner considering all the circumstances of the case which

would not have caused any prejudice to any party;

e) The Learned High Court Judge has erred when not even issuing

formal notices as considering the circumstances the application

made on both legal and sympathetic grounds could have been

considered by the state as well;

f) The Learned High Court Judge has erred in law and fact by not

considering that the Leaned Magistrate of Walasmulla has failed

to take into considering that not converting the fine imposed on

the Petitioner as a state cost would end the 22 years of career of

the Petitioner as an Army Soldier.

It is well settled law that the revision is a discretionary remedy that can

be granted only upon exceptional circumstances. In the petition filed by

the Petitioner does not disclose any specific exceptional circumstances,

which he relies upon. The Petitioners main application to consider the

triviality of the offence and in all circumstances of the case that if

orders stated above are allowed to stand, he would lose his job and

other benefits accrued him.

In Wijesinghe v Tharmaratnam (Sri kantha Law Report Vol-IV 47), the

court held that:

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available

unless the application discloses circumstances which shocks the

conscience of the Court.

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. V Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd.

1987 1 SLR 5 the Court held that:

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the

appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional

circumstances exist warranting its intervention.

The Petitioner states that he served for the Sri Lanka Army for about 22

years with an unblemished service record. As a result of the fine

imposed on him by the learned Magistrate of Walasmulla, he would be

deprived of all benefits and entitlements accrued to him over 22 years of

service in the Military.

Hence, considering the offence and the punishment imposed on the

Petitioner by the Learned Magistrate of Walasmulla, I consider this is an

appropriate case to issue notice to the Respondent.

Considering all the factors mentioned above, I conclude this is an

appropriate case to issue notice to the Hon. Attorney General

(Respondent.)

Hence, we allow notice in this case.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Order to the High

Court of Tangalle and the Learned Magistrate of Wasalmulla for

information.

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
