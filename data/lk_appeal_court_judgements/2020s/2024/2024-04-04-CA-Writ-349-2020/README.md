S.U.B. Karalliyadde, J.

The 1st Petitioner, the Centre for Environmental Justice, is a Company limited by

guarantee and duly incorporated under the Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007 and has

instituted this Writ Application in the public interest to ensure compliance with

environmental protection laws, regulations and procedures and to ensure the

performance of the Respondents entrusted duties and obligations. On or about

4

11.07.2020, the 1st Respondent, the Marine Environment Protection Authority (the

MEPA) received information that 19 bowsers filled with wastewater sludge originated

from the Intervenient-Respondent, Teejay Lanka PLC situated at Seethawaka Industrial

Zone were scheduled to be transported to Madampitiya to be pumped to the sea using

Madampitiya Sewerage Pumping Station. The Teejay Lanka PLC contracted the

services of Kaburupola Engineering and Constructions, the 7th Respondent for the

removal, transportation and discharge of the sludge to the Madampitiya Pumping

Station. Ten out of nineteen bowsers were dispatched and five of them (vehicles bearing

Nos. LK-2654, LL-1992, LM-6318, LL-8225 AND LO-5730) were apprehended by the

MEPA, Special Task Force and the Environmental Police Unit of the Grandpass Police

Station. By the time the other bowsers had already pumped the wastewater sludge to

the sea through the Madampitiya Pumping Station and left the premises. The five

bowsers that were apprehended and the drivers were handed over after a complaint was

lodged at the Grandpass Police Station in terms of the Marine Pollution Prevention Act,

No. 35 of 2008. A permit dated 19.12.2019 marked as P7 has been issued to the 7th

Respondent by the Colombo Municipal Council to dispose of the sewage at the

Madampitiya Pumping Station prior to the alleged incident. However, in terms of that

permit, only sewerage from toilet pits and other similar sources is permitted to be

discharged, but oil, grease, acid or any other effluent other than sewage is not permitted

to discharge into the system. The Petitioners allege that the 7th Respondent had

transported toxic wastewater sludge and discharged them at the Madampitiya Pumping

Station and a Report dated 28.07.2020 marked as P9 had been obtained from the

Chemical and Microbiological Laboratory of the Industrial Technology Institute, which

reveals that the samples collected by the MEPA contains hazardous effluents including

Arsenic. The Grandpass Police filed a case (bearing No.36335/04/2020) against the

5

drivers of the bowsers at the Colombo Magistrates Court and they were released on

bail. However, that case was subsequently withdrawn on the instructions of the Hon.

Attorney General (P8). Then the 2nd Petitioner along with other parties concerned filed

a Public Nuisance case at the Colombo Magistrates Court, consequent to which the

learned Magistrate issued a conditional order relating to the disposal of the sludge

contained in the detained bowsers. The Petitioners allege that the bowsers detained by

the Police were in the Grandpass Police custody even up to the date of institution of

this Application.

This Application has been filed by the Petitioners alleging that,

1) The MEPA and the CEA have failed to bring any charges before the court against

the owners and transporters of the hazardous sludge for discharging such toxic

wastewater sludge to the sea in violation of the provisions of the Marine Pollution

Prevention Act, No. 35 of 2008 and the National Environment Act, No. 47 of 1980.

2) The Hon. Attorney General has failed in his duty to indict the real perpetrators as

per Section 50 of the Marine Pollution Prevention Act.

3) The Inspector General of Police (the 4th Respondent) and the Officer-in-Charge of

the Grandpass Police Station (the 5th Respondent) have failed to conduct a proper

investigation into the said matter and apprehend the perpetrators involved and to

record statements of witnesses and conduct a thorough investigation with regard

to the five bowsers that had already dumped the sewerage into the sea.

4) The 3rd Respondent, the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) has acted

arbitrarily and ultra vires violating Section 20 and Section 20A of the Greater

Colombo Economic Commission Law, No. 04 of 1978 (as amended) in granting a

license/approval to Teejay Lanka PLC for the removal, transportation and

6

discharge of wastewater sludge at the Madampitiya Pumping Station (P10) without

consulting and obtaining the concurrence of the CEA.

5) The 6th Respondent, the Municipal Commissioner of the Colombo Municipal

Council had failed to monitor the activities of the 7th Respondent and failed to

investigate and take necessary actions against the 7th Respondent for violation of

the conditions set out in the permit marked as P7 and failed to act in terms of

Sections 96 and 181 of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, No. 29 of 1947 (as

amended) to take actions against the officers who were acted in collusion with the

perpetrators in dumping unauthorised waste into the sea.

6) The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th Respondents have failed to perform their statutory duty and

responsibility for regulating, maintaining and controlling sources of pollution of

the environment and for protecting and improving the quality of the environment

in terms of the aforementioned Acts and the National Environmental (Protection

and Quality) Regulations No. 01 of 2008.

The Petitioners argue that the Respondents have a statutory duty to perform the duties

and obligations vested upon them under the above-mentioned Acts and the Regulation

and the powers have been conferred on them in the public trust. The Petitioners further

argue that the aforementioned failures, omissions and inaction on the part of one or

more or all of the Respondents are arbitrary, unreasonable and in breach of the public

trust reposed on them. The Petitioners seek the following substantive reliefs, inter alia,

b) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing and/or

compelling the 8th Respondent to indict the perpetrators under the Marine

Pollution Prevention Act No. 35 of 2008;

c) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing and/or

compelling the 4th and the 5th Respondent to conduct an independent

7

investigation into the said matter without any unreasonable delay and apprehend

all parties involved;

d) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing and/or

compelling the 1st and 2nd Respondents to investigate the said disposal of toxic

wastewater sludge to the sea and other places in violation of the provisions of the

Marine Pollution Prevention Act No. 35 of 2008 and National Environment Act

and regulations made thereunder and take necessary actions against all parties

involved,

e) Grant an order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the approval issued

by the 3rd Respondent without consultation with and after having obtained the

concurrence of the Central Environmental Authority to the Teejay Lanka PLC or

the transportation and disposal of waste marked "P10".

f) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing and/ or

compelling the 1st 2nd and 6th Respondent to monitor the sewage disposal

facilities which discharge effluents to the sea, to establish checkpoints managed

by the 1st and 2nd Respondents together with the Environmental Police Units

and/or Armed Forces at such facilities;

g) Grant and issue an order in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing and/or

compelling the 2nd Respondent to coordinate all waste disposal activities by

industries in terms of Section 10 of the National Environmental Act, in order to

minimize the illegal dumping of harmful waste and effluents to the environment

I will first address the allegations of the Petitioners with regard to the inaction of the

MEPA and the CEA. The contention of the learned Counsel appearing for the

Petitioners is that the MEPA and the CEA failed to take legal action against the owners

and transporters of the hazardous sludge for discharging to the sea in violation of the

8

Marine Pollution Prevention Act and the National Environment Act. The learned

Counsel appearing for the Petitioners brought to the notice of the Court the fact that in

terms of Section 27 of the Marine Pollution Prevention Act, other than under a permit

obtained by the MEPA, any person who dumps oil, harmful substances or other

pollutant into the territorial waters of Sri Lanka or any other maritime zone, its fore-

shore and the coastal zone of Sri Lanka shall be guilty of an offence under the Act. The

position of the MEPA in that regard is that there is no blatant violation of law and/or

any omission on the part of the officials of the MEPA in the discharge of their statutory

functions under the provisions of the Marine Pollution Prevention Act and they had

taken all possible steps regarding the alleged incident including lodging police

complaints, sending contaminated water samples to the Government Analyst,

conducting investigations, etc. The MEPA has taken up the position that the power and

authority to handle and issue licenses for the transportation and disposal of waste is

vested with the CEA under the National Environment Act. The CEA denies the

allegation of the Petitioners that they had failed to take necessary action in this regard

and pleaded that the action had been taken against the Company owner for violation of

environmental laws and on 11.07.2020 site inspection was carried out to investigate the

complaint received by the 2nd Respondent regarding the illegal discharge of sludge

(2R2). After the case filed by the Gradpass Police in the Magistrates Court was

withdrawn, the CEA as the Environmental Regulator has taken steps under the National

Environmental Act and filed 5 separate cases against the drivers of the bowsers (2R3a

to 2R3e). All the cases had to be taken for inquiry on 19.10.2022. Moreover, the CEA

filed a case against the Teejay Lanka PLC in the Magistrates Court Avissawella

(marked as 2R17) and the Teejay Lanka PLC raised preliminary objections in that case

and an order was made on 30.04.2021 upholding that preliminary objection. Being

9

aggrieved by the said order the CEA made a Revision application to the High Court of

Avissawella on 11.11.2021 marked as 2R18. Confirming these facts the learned

Presidents Counsel appearing for the Teejay Lanka PLC informed this Court that, by a

private plaint dated 23.07.2020, an NGO including the 2nd Petitioner had filed a case in

the Magistrates Court of Colombo (case No. 37475/2020) naming the Teejay Lanka

PLC as the 1st Accused and that case was subsequently dismissed.

With regard to the allegation of the Petitioners that the detained five bowsers remain at

the Grandpass Police station, the learned ASG appearing for the 1st to 5th Respondents

informed the Court that, the five bowsers that were detained were transported to INSEE

Eco Cycle Lanka (Pvt) Ltd at Katunayake Export Processing Zone on 03.09.2020 under

the supervision of the Magistrates Court and with the participation of the officers of

CEA, BOI and Police for destroying the sludge contained in the bowsers in an

environmentally friendly manner. The learned Presidents Counsel appearing for the 7th

Respondent in support of the submission of the learned ASG stated that the CEA and

MEPA had carried out intense investigations into the alleged incident and found that no

sludge or any toxic substance was discharged into the sea through the Madampitiya

Pumping Station and thereby not committed any offence under the Marine Pollution

Prevention Act and steps were taken to dispose the sludge contained in the detained

bowsers under the direct order and supervision of relevant officers and the learned

Magistrate of Colombo who personally supervised such disposal according to the

directions of the CEA. The learned Presidents Counsel drew the attention of the Court

to the fact that the 7th Respondent and the drivers of the five gully bowsers had pleaded

guilty at the Magistrates Court and accordingly, fines and suspended sentences were

imposed upon them by the learned Magistrate (journal entry dated 12.12.2022 in case

No. 38236/04/20 marked as X).

10

In prayer (d) the Petitioners are seeking a Writ of Mandamus directing MEPA and CEA

to investigate the alleged incident of disposal of toxic wastewater sludge to the sea and

other places in violation of the provisions of the Marine Pollution Prevention Act and

National Environment Act and regulations thereto and take necessary legal action

against all the parties involved. When considering the above-stated facts, this Court can

be satisfied that the MEPA and the CEA had taken necessary steps to bring forthwith

the perpetrators of the alleged incident before the court of law and deal with them

according to the provisions of the Marine Pollution Prevention Act and the National

Environment Act. Under such circumstances, this Court sees no merit in the argument

of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners that MEPA and CEA had failed to

take steps in respect of the alleged incident and therefore, this Court refuse to grant the

relief prayed for in prayer (d) to the Petition of this Application. Furthermore, according

to the extracts marked as 5R1 to 5R7 produced by the 1st to 5th Respondents regarding

the statements recorded of the witnesses and the suspects and the investigations carried

out by the Police, this Court cannot agree with the contention of the learned Counsel

appearing for the Petitioners that the 4th and 5th Respondents had failed to perform their

duty. In prayer (b) to the Petition, the Petitioners are seeking a Writ of Mandamus

directing the 8th Respondent to indict the perpetrators before the High Court under the

Marine Pollution Prevention Act and in prayer (c), a Writ of Mandamus directing the

4th and the 5th Respondent to conduct an independent investigation into the said matter

and apprehend all parties involved. Upon considering all the above-stated facts and

circumstances, I am of the view that a necessity does not arise to grant reliefs prayed

for in prayers (b) and (c) in the Petition to this Application and therefore refuse to grant

those reliefs.

11

In respect of the allegations made against the Municipal Commissioner of Colombo

(the 6th Respondent) the learned Counsel appearing for the 6th Respondent submitted

that as per the letter dated 12.06.2020 issued by the CEA marked as C1 Kaburapola

Engineering and Construction (the 7th Respondent) had been authorized by the CEA to

transport treated wastewater for the years 2020-2021 by three vehicles bearing Nos.

LM-8870, LO-3562 and LO-5730 and the registration of those vehicles for

transportation was valid till 31.12.2021. Accordingly, the Colombo Municipality has

issued the permit marked as P7 granting permission till 30.06.2020 to the above-

mentioned three vehicles to transport sewage from toilet pits and other similar sources

to the Madampitiya Pumping Station. After the validity period of C1 expired, the

Municipality issued another permit valid up to 31.12.2020 marked as C2 to the 7th

Respondent in respect of the above-mentioned three vehicles to discharge wastewater

at the Madampitiya Pumping Station. When the Municipality came to know about the

alleged incident, it immediately took steps to suspend the permits issued by it to the 7th

Respondent. Upon several appeals made by the Gully Bowser Owners Welfare

Association (marked as C4(a) and C4(b)), the Municipality lifted the suspension and

granted temporary approval to the vehicles including the vehicle bearing No. LO-5730

by the letter dated 16.10.2020 marked as C5 on the condition that the drivers of the said

vehicles would not be allowed to visit the unloading site. The Counsel appearing for

the Municipal Commissioner, the 6th Respondent argued that the Municipality has

discharged its functions according to law particularly by imposing strict conditions,

conducting relevant tests prior to issuance of permits and suspending the permit upon

breach of the conditions in the permit. The Petitioners have also admitted in the Petition

to this Application the fact that the 6th Respondent imposed strict conditions prior to the

issuance of the permit. The learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners further argued

12

that the 6th Respondent has acted in violation of Section 181 of the Municipal Councils

Ordinance by failing to take action against the officers who allegedly acted in collusion

with the perpetrators. Section 181 reads thus,

Any officer or servant of a Municipal Council (other than a member of the Local

Government service), may be suspended or dismissed, or fined or reduced in

status, or any increment to his salary may be withheld for any specified period for

any breach of departmental rules or discipline or for carelessness, incompetence,

neglect of duty or other misconduct

This Court cannot agree with the argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the

Petitioners that the 6th Respondent has acted in violation of Section 181, as the 6th

Respondent and the officers of the Colombo Municipal Council have taken all possible

steps including taking steps to impose strict conditions at the time issuance of the

permits marked as P7 and C2 and have taken immediate steps to suspend the permit

granted to the 7th Respondent upon becoming aware of the alleged incident.

Now I will address the argument of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners

that BOI has acted arbitrarily and violated Sections 20 and 20A of the Greater Colombo

Economic Commission Law by granting licence/approval to Teejay Lanka PLC

(marked as P10) without the concurrence of the CEA. The learned ASG appearing for

the 1st to 5th Respondents submitted that BOI has the authority to make decisions

relating to the operation of Enterprises within the Zone under the Greater Colombo

Economic Commission Law and the National laws of the country. The approval has

been given by the BOI to Teejay Lanka PLC since 2009 to dispose of liquid waste at

the treatment facility at Madampitiya by the letter dated 06.04.2009 marked as 3R2.

The Environmental Protection Licence (the EPL) of Teejay Lanka PLC expired on

13

24.04.2020. Since the industry was registered under the BOI, BOI had made the request

dated 23.01.2020 marked as 2R7 from the CEA to arrange an inspection to renew the

EPL and the officers of CEA carried out an inspection on 03.03.2020 (2R8) in that

regard. On 11.07.2020, the CEA received a complaint from the MEPA regarding the

discharging of sludge generated from industrial wastewater to sea through the

Madampitiya Pumping Station. The approval was obtained from the BOI to discharge

sludge to Madampitiya Pumping Station by the letter dated 10.07.2020 marked as

2R9/P10. CEA then informed the Teejay Lanka PLC by letter dated 16.07.2020 marked

as 2R11 about the inability to grant concurrence to BOI for the renewal of EPL and to

stop industrial operations until further notice. Meanwhile CEA by letter dated

22.07.2020 marked as 2R12 informed BOI that it has no objection for operating the

industrial activities of Teejay Lanka PLC subject to the conditions stipulated in the EPL.

It is evident from the letter marked as P10/2R9 and the above-stated facts that the BOI

has indeed granted approval to the Teejay Lanka PLC to discharge sludge to

Madampitiya Pumping Station without the concurrence of the CEA as the EPL had

expired and was in the process renewing. However, it should also be noted that an EPL

including special conditions has been issued with the concurrence of the CEA as evident

from the letters dated 23.03.2021 marked as 3R3 and 2R15 after carrying out a joint

inspection by the CEA and BOI on 17.02.2021 (2R16). By prayer (e) to the Petition,

the Petitioners seek a Writ of Certiorari to quash P10, where BOI has given approval to

Teejay Lanka PLC for the transportation and disposal of waste without the concurrence

of the CEA. However, the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners has informed

this Court on 05.03.2021, that he is not pursuing the relief prayed for in prayer (e). This

Court is not inclined to grant the relief prayed for in prayer (e) even if the Petitioners

14

are pursuing the said relief as a new EPL has been issued by the BOI in concurrence

with the CEA, which in fact will result in P10 being futile.

When considering all the above-stated facts this Court cannot agree with the contention

of the learned Counsel appearing for the Petitioners that the Respondents have failed to

perform their statutory duties and responsibilities in regulating, maintaining and

controlling sources of pollution of the environment under the Marine Pollution

Prevention Act, National Environment Act and the National Environmental (Protection

and Quality) Regulations.

Considering all the above-stated facts and circumstances this Court is of the view that

the Petitioners are not entitled to the reliefs sought in prayer (b) to (g) to the Petition.

Therefore, this Court dismisses this Writ Application. No costs ordered.

Application dismissed.
