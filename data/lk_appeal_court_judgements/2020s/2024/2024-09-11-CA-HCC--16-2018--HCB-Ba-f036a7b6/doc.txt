JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) were indicted jointly in the High Court of Balapitiya for

committing grievous hurt by throwing acid on Withanachchi Gunawardena

Siriyalatha punishable under Section 317 of the Penal Code on 09th

November 2006.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Balapitiya after serving

indictment on the Appellants on 24/03/2010. The prosecution had called 05

witnesses and marked productions P1-P2 and P2(a). After the conclusion of

the prosecution case, the learned High Court Judge had called for the

defence and the Appellants had made dock statements and called a witness

on their behalf and closed their case. After considering the evidence

presented by both parties, the learned High Court Judge had convicted the

Appellants as charged.

The Appellants were sentenced as follows on 03/04/2018:

Each Appellant was sentenced to 7 1/2 years rigorous imprisonment

and a fine of Rs.1500/- with a default sentence of 03 months rigorous

imprisonment.

In addition, the learned High Court Judge had directed the Appellants

to pay a compensation of Rs.150,000/- each to PW1 with a default

sentence of 01 years simple imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants have given consent to argue this matter in their absence. At the

time of argument, the Appellants were connected via Zoom platform from

prison.

Background of the Case.

PW1 was living with her husband in a separate house. The Appellants were

living as tenants in a house owned by PW1s husband. As the Appellants

were involved in selling cannabis and illicit liquor based from this rental

house a dispute had arisen between them which ended in the Appellants

verbally abusing PW1 and her husband on several occasions. PW1 and her

husband had lodged several complaints with the police regarding this

dispute and had requested the Appellants to vacate the rental premises.

On the day of the incident when PW1 was walking towards the toilet which

was situated at the rear of her house, the Appellants had ambushed her and

had thrown acid at her. She had clearly seen that both the Appellants were

present when she was attacked with acid.

Due to the serious nature of the injury sustained on her body, particularly

on her face, the victim, PW1 had lost eyesight in both her eyes and was blind

when she appeared before the High Court to give evidence. As such, PW1

could not identify the Appellants at the trial. Therefore, the prosecution case

solely rested on the evidence of PW1, who is supposed to be the purported

eye witness to the incident.

According to PW6, the JMO who examined PW1, the victim had told him that

two known persons had attacked her with acid. He had observed blackish

brown first and second-degree corrosive burns on her face (4.5%), front

aspect of the neck, upper chest (6%), right upper limb (5%) and left upper

limb (3%). The total percentage of burn injuries were 18.5%.

There were splash burns on the face, front aspect of upper chest and right

upper limb. There were vertical chip marks on both upper limbs and front

aspect of the chest. There were burns on both ear lobes, lips and tongue.

Periorbital oedema was present around the eyes.

Both Appellants in their dock statements denied charges levelled against

them.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants had raised three grounds of

appeal which are set out below:

1. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by failing to consider the

material discrepancy with regard to the visual identification of the

Appellants beyond reasonable doubt.

2. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by rejecting the defence on

wrong premise.

CA/HCC/16/2018

5 | P a g e

3. The learned High Court Judge erred in law by considering the

unreliable evidence of the victim to convict the Appellants.

As the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellants are interconnected, all

grounds will be considered together hereinafter. This case, as claimed by the

learned Counsel entirely rests on evidence given by PW1.

The alleged incident had happened due to the warning given to the

Appellants by PW1s husband to vacate the rental premises they were

occupying as they suspected that the Appellants were selling Cannabis and

illicit liquor from the rental house. This was the sole reason for the incident.

The husband and the mother-in-law of PW1 had passed away before they

could give evidence at the trial.

PW1 had identified both the Appellants when they were standing behind a

wall. She had not been able to take any cover or protect herself as the 1st

Appellant had thrown acid on her quite suddenly.

The identity of the accused, as a person who committed the offence is a fact

in issue at a criminal trial and evidence as to identification of the accused by

a witness, is relevant and admissible.

The prosecution should provide proper evidence to establish the identity of

the alleged perpetrator and his presence at the crime scene as the burden

falls on the prosecution to prove that the accused in fact is the person who

committed the crime, and that too, at a very high standard of proof beyond

reasonable doubt. They should do this by leading direct, indirect or

circumstantial evidence of identification which would more often than not

include direct evidence of state witnesses who saw the accused committing

the said criminal act at the scene of crime at the given time.

CA/HCC/16/2018

However, it is very important that the Court should always be aware of the

danger that is of a seemingly honest witness being able to falsely implicate

an accused in a crime due to various reasons including but not limited to

bias and malice. Therefore, the Court should always be cautious to require

careful scrutiny of the honesty and credibility of the witnesses, especially if

he is a single eye witness.

In this case, the Appellants are well known to the witness as they were the

tenants of a house which was owned by the husband of PW1. Further,

regular disputes persisted over the suspected criminal activities allegedly

committed by the Appellants in their rental house. As such, PW1 did not

have any difficulty in identifying the Appellants at the crime scene.

In R v. Turnbull [1977] QB 224 the court held that:

Where the case against an accused depends wholly or substantially on

the correctness of one or more identifications of the accused-which the

defence alleges to be mistaken-the judge should be cautious before

convicting the accused in reliance on the correctness of the

identification(s). The judge should take into consideration that:

Caution is required to avoid the risk of injustice;

A witness who is honest may be wrong even if they are convinced,

they are right;

A witness who is convincing may still be wrong;

More than one witness may be wrong;

A witness who recognizes the defendant, even when the witness

knows the defendant very well, may be wrong.

CA/HCC/16/2018

The learned High Court Judge, in his judgment had extensively discussed

the identification of the Appellants by PW1. The defense did not succeed in

creating a doubt with regard to the identification of the Appellants. Hence,

in this case, the identification of the Appellants is not an issue as claimed by

the Respondent.

Further, I consider it worthy to mention the remorse expressed by the

Appellant to PW1. The 2nd Appellant along with the 1st Appellant had gone to

PW1s house after her return from the hospital. The 2nd Appellant had

confessed to PW1 revealing facts about the way they planned the attack and

their motive. She had also told her the composition of the acid that was used

in the attack. Although the 1st Appellant denied the offence he failed to

answer the question put forward by PW1 regarding the clothes he was

wearing when he attacked the her with acid. This had also been considered

by the learned High Court Judge to arrive at his decision.

The principle of the Common Intention is that if two or more people who

possess the same intention get together for the purpose of achieving their

common target and they act in furtherance of the common intention of all,

in such an instance all persons who have participated in the commission of

the act would be become jointly liable and will face criminal charges together.

In this case evidence transpired that the Appellants had actuated common

intention at the time of committing the offence. They had the common

intention to achieve the particular consequences. As long as they entertain

such intention jointly, they will be held jointly responsible for their actions.

CA/HCC/16/2018

In King v. Ranasinghe et al 47 NLR 373 the court held that:

Common intention within the meaning of section 32 of the penal Code

is different from same or similar intention. The inference of common

intention should not be reached unless it is a necessary inference

deducible from the circumstances of the case.

For the reasons elaborated above, the learned High Court Judge had been

accurate in attributing common intention to both the 1st and 2nd Appellants.

He had considered the evidence presented by the defense very extensively

and had given plausible reasons as to why he believes that the prosecution

version has merit and why the defense version lacks merit. Hence, it is

incorrect to say that the learned High Court Judge had not considered the

evidence presented by the defense.

The learned High Court Judge had not considered unreliable evidence when

arriving at his judgment. He had acted on reliable evidence after considering

the contradictions marked by the defense. When the contradictions are not

capable to attack the core of the case, the learned High Court Judge is

entitled to conclude that the prosecution had proved the case beyond

reasonable doubt.

Notably, the trial court had relied on the injured witness PW1 whose

injuries had not been challenged. Although the case was based on the

evidence of a solitary eye witness and the witness had enmity with the

appellants, her evidence was not challenged on material facts. It is not the

quantity of the witnesses but the quality of the witnesses which matters, in

a criminal trial. As discussed under the grounds of appeal advanced by the

Appellants, I conclude that the prosecution had adduced strong and

incriminating evidence against the Appellants. The learned High Court Judge

had accurately analyzed all the evidence presented by all the parties and had

CA/HCC/16/2018

finally arrived at the correct finding that the Appellants are guilty of

committing voluntary grievous hurt on the victim in this case.

Therefore, I affirm the conviction and dismiss the appeal of the Appellants.

Since the Appellants are on bail pending appeal, I order that their sentence

should commence from the day this judgment is pronounced upon the

Appellants by the learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya.

The Registrar is directed to send this judgement to the High Court of

Balapitiya along with the original case record.
