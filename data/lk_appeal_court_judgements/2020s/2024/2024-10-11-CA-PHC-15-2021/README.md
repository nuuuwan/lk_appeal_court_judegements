Introduction

The Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) was an

employee of the 2nd Respondent-Respondent, Seemasahitha Keppitiyagoda

Kantha Naya Ganudenu Pilibada Samupakara Samithiya (hereinafter referred

to as the 2nd Respondent). The 1st Respondent-Respondent is the Registrar and

Commissioner of the Co-operative Development Department of the Southern

Province (hereinafter referred to as the 1st Respondent).

Factual background

A dispute arose between the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent concerning an

alleged misappropriation of funds totaling Rs. 2,170,499.34, which the 1st

Respondent referred to arbitration. Following an inquiry, the arbitrator issued an

award under Section 59 of the Co-operative Societies Law No. 5 of 1972

(hereinafter referred to as 'the Co-operative Societies Law'), ordering the

Appellant to pay the 2nd Respondent Rs. 10,66,38.44, along with Rs. 25,800.00

4

in litigation costs, amounting to a total of Rs. 1,32,438.34. Additionally, a 16%

annual interest was imposed until the full amount is paid.

The Appellant, dissatisfied with the award, appealed to the 1st Respondent under

Section 38(2) of the Co-operative Societies Law.

The 1st Respondent, acting under Rule 49(xii)(b) of the Co-operative Societies

Rules, made pursuant to Section 61 of the Co-operative Societies Law and

published in Extraordinary Gazette No. 93/5 dated 10th January 1974 (hereinafter

referred to as 'the Rule'), rejected the appeal on the ground that the Appellant had

failed to make the required appeal deposit as stipulated by Rule 49(xii)(a).

The aggrieved Appellant sought a Writ of certiorari to quash the letter dated 2nd

December 2015, through which the 1st Respondent, the Registrar and

Commissioner of the Co-operative Development Department of the Southern

Province, dismissed the Appellant's appeal. Additionally, the Appellant sought a

Writ of mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to acknowledge the appeal.

The learned High Court Judge of the Southern Province, holden at Galle, after

considering the Appellant's Petition, the Respondents' objections, the submitted

documents, and the parties' submissions, dismissed the Appellant's Writ

application in the impugned order dated 29th January 2021.

The Appellant subsequently appealed to this Court against that decision.

In addition, the Appellant filed a Revision application as well, challenging the

same order.

At the argument on 15th July, 2024, the learned Counsel for the Appellant

indicated that he would accept this judgment in the connected revision

application No. CPA 64/2021.

Analysis

For clarity, I will start with reproducing the relevant Rule.

Rule 49 (xii) (a) and (b) reads as follows;

5

49 (i) to (xi) (.)

49 (xii) (a) Every appeal to the Registrar from an award of an arbitrator or a

panel of arbitrators shall be made within 30 days from the date of the award by

a written statement setting out the grounds of appeal. Every such appeal shall be

forwarded to the Registrar with an appeal deposit of Rs. 50 or 10% of the sum

awarded where the appeal is made by the party against whom the award has

been made and by Rs. 10% of the sum claimed in the dispute where the appeal is

made by the party claiming any sum of money, whichever sum is the higher sum

in either case.

(b) an appeal not made in conformity with the above shall be rejected by

the Registrar.

(xii)(c) (xiii) ()

This appeal was filed by the party against whom the award was made. Therefore,

according to the Rules, Rs. 50/- or 10% of the awarded sum, whichever is higher,

must be deposited as security for the appeal. In this case, the awarded amount

was Rs. 1,132,438.34/-, and 10% of that, Rs. 132,438.34/-, being the higher sum,

should have been deposited. However, the Appellant admittedly deposited only

Rs. 100/-, failing to comply with Rule 49(xii)(a)1. As a result, the 1st Respondent,

the Registrar and Commissioner of the Co-operative Development Department

of the Southern Province, dismissed the appeal under Rule 49(xii)(b) for non-

compliance with Rule 49(xii)(a).

Vires of Rule 49 (xii)(a)

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner, relying on the Supreme Court judgment

in Sebestian Fernando v. Katana Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Limited

and others2 (hereinafter referred to as the Sebestian Fernando judgment),

argued that the Supreme Court deemed Rule 49(xii)(a) to be ultra vires.

1 Vide paragraph 10 of the Affidavit filed in support of the Petition filed in the High Court of Galle.

2 [1990]1 Sri L.R. 342.

6

Therefore, the 1st Respondent's decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal is

legally invalid.

In response, the learned State Counsel for the 1st and 3rd Respondents contended

that the observation in the Sebastian Fernando judgment, stating that Rule

49(xii)(a) is ultra vires, is not the ratio decidendi of the case, but rather obiter

dictum. Therefore, no Court is obligated to follow the Supreme Court's

observations regarding the vires of Rule 49(xii)(a). Further, it was argued that

following the decision of Sebestian Fernando, in a series of judgements, this

Court distinguished the Sebestian Fernando judgement and held otherwise.

Sebastian Fernandos case

The relevant facts of the Sebestian Fernandos case concerning the instant appeal

are as follows: the Appellant, who was also an employee of a co-operative

society, was accused of a shortage. The dispute was referred to an arbitrator, who

found the Appellant liable. When the Appellant lodged an appeal, he failed to

make the required deposit under the Rule, leading to the rejection of the appeal.

Three years later, the Appellant sought to invoke the Writ jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal, which dismissed the application without issuing notice to the

Respondents, citing unexplained delay. Importantly, the Appellant did not

challenge the vires of Rule 49(xii)(a) in the Court of Appeal, raising this issue

for the first time in the appeal to the Supreme Court.

In the majority judgment of Sebestian Fernando, His Lordship Fernando J., with

whom Bandaranayake J. concurred, made the following observations regarding

Rule 49(xii)(a):

Thus, a serious question arises as to the vires of Rule 49 (XII)(a): that the

requirement of an appeal deposit is not authorized by sections 58 (3), 61 (1) or

61(2) (y). However, as that question was not placed before the Court appeal for

consideration, and as the Respondents were not heard in that Court (nor in this

Court, though duly noticed) it is only proper that it should be determined by

7

that Court, after such amendment of the petition as that Court may permit in its

discretion, and after hearing the Respondents. (Emphasis added)

In the judgment of Kulathunga J., similar observations were made, which state:

Thus far it seems possible to defend the impugned rule; but the most formidable

challenge to it, namely the objection to the requirement that the appellant should

deposit 10% of the sum awarded or claimed has to be met. There is no provision

for relaxing this requirement; in default of such payment the Registrar is

enjoined by Rule 49 (XII) (b) to reject the appeal. Having regard to the language

of the Rule and the subject matter under consideration it does not seem possible

to exempt an appellant from the liability to pay the required appeal deposit even

by the application of the maxim lex non cogit ad impossibilia. I therefore

agree with my brother Fernando, J. that this rule may discourage and even

prevent appeals made bona fide and upon good grounds solely because an

appellant does not have the means of making the required appeal deposit.

For the above reasons, I am of the view that a serious question arises as to the

vires of Rule 49 (XII) (a). this question was not raised in the appellants

application to the Court of Appeal but only in this Court; leave was allowed on

that ground and the question was argued without the respondents being heard.

As such, it is only proper that a determination on that ground should be made

by the Court of Appeal after such amendment of the petition as that Court may

permit in its discretion. (Emphasis added)

I acknowledge that the Supreme Court presented logical and well-founded

reasons for its observation that Rule 49(xii)(a) is ultra vires. However, it is

evident from the quoted excerpts that the Supreme Court did not arrive at a

definitive conclusion regarding the vires of the Rule. Instead, the Court merely

observed that there is a serious question concerning the vires of Rule 49(xii)(a).

The effective order made by the Supreme Court was to allow the appeal, set aside

the Court of Appeal's order refusing to issue notice and dismissing the

8

application. It is crucial to note that the Supreme Court allowed the appeal not

based on its observations regarding the vires of the Rule but rather on the grounds

that the Court of Appeal should have issued notice to the Respondents. The

Supreme Court directed the Court of Appeal to issue notice to the Respondents

and to consider any amendments to the Petition. This indicates that the Supreme

Court was deliberating an amendment to the Petition that would challenge the

vires of Rule 49(xii)(a).

In the case of W.D.M.L. Dissanayaka v. Co-operative Development

Commissioner and Registrar and Four Others3 (C.A.), His Lordship Janak De

Silva J. sitting in the Court of Appeal (as His Lordship then was) noted that when

the Sebestian Fernandos case was referred back to the Court of Appeal, the State

provided an undertaking to the Court that the Registrar of the Co-operative

Development would entertain the Petition of appeal despite the insufficiency of

fees. As a result of this undertaking, the Petitioner withdrew the application.

Consequently, the Court of Appeal did not make any findings regarding the vires

of Rule 49(xii)(a).

Ratio decidendi and obiter dictum

It is trite law that the ratio decidendi of a judgment from a Superior Court is

binding on all inferior courts. This principle is known as the doctrine of stare

decisis. His Lordship Thamodaran J. articulated this in the case of Walkers Sons

Co. (UK) Ltd. v. Gunatilake and Others4, where His Lordship observed:

The ratio decidendi of cases decided by the Court becomes a rule for the future

binding all courts which are not the courts of last resort whether it be under the

same system or under a different system.

Blacks Law Dictionary provides the following definition for ratio decidendi:5

3 (C.A.) PHC 12/2014.

4 [1978-79-80] 1 Sri.L.R. 231 at p.252.

5 B. A. Garner and H. C. Black, Black's Law Dictionary, Ninth Edition, 2009. at p.1376.

9

The principle or rule of law on which a courts decision is founded

Obiter dictum is defined as follows:6

[Latin something said in passing] A judicial comment made while delivering

a judicial opinion, but one that is unnecessary to the decision in the case and

therefore not precedential (although it may be considered persuasive). Often

shortened to dictum or, less commonly, obiter (emphasis added).

In light of the aforementioned facts, it is clear that their Lordships of the Supreme

Court did not make a definitive finding regarding the vires of Rule 49(xii)(a) and

left that determination to the Court of Appeal. Therefore, the statements

concerning the vires of the Rule are clearly obiter dictum and are not binding on

inferior Courts. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that these observations are

persuasive.

Somaratnes case

Weerakkody Pathirennehelage Somaratne of Gogodagama v. Commissioner of

Co-operative Societies and Four Others (hereinafter referred to as Somaratnes

case)7 is a case in which Rule 49(xii) was subjected to scrutiny by the Supreme

Court. The relevant facts of the case are as follows: The Appellant submitted an

appeal to the 5th Respondent against an award within the prescribed thirty-day

period, which should have been forwarded to the 1st Respondent. However, the

Appellant did not make the required appeal deposit as stipulated by the Rule.

Although the 5th Respondent was not obligated to do so, he forwarded the appeal

to the 1st Respondent, but this was done after the thirty-day period. Consequently,

the 1st Respondent rejected the appeal on two grounds: that it was out of time

and that the appeal deposit had not been made.

In Somaratnes case, the Supreme Court analyzed Rule 49(xii)(a) alongside

relevant Sections 58(3) and 61(2)(y) of the Co-operative Societies Law. Unlike

6 Ibid at p. at p.1177. 7 S.C. case No. SC appeal 58/80.

10

in Sebestian Fernandos case, the Court arrived at a definite and unequivocal

finding that the Rule is intra vires. The following observations made by His

Lordship Ismail J. (with whom Justices Wanasundera J. and Ratwatte J.

concurred) unequivocally confirm this position:

Counsel appearing for the petitioner contended that Rule 49 (xii) (a) cannot

circumscribe the right of appeal that had been granted to the petitioner in section

58 (3) of Co-operative Societies Law No. 5 of 1972. This Section reads,

Any party aggrieved by the award of the arbitrator or

arbitrators may appeal therefrom to the Registrar with in such

period and in such manner as may be prescribed by rules.

This sub-section must necessarily be read with the rule making powers granted

to the appropriate Minister under Section 61, which I have already referred to.

Under sub-section 61 (2)(y) the Minister is unpowered to frame rules to

prescribe the forms to be used, the fees to be paid, the procedure to be observed,

and all other matters connected with or incidental to the presentation, hearing

and disposal of appeals under this Law or the rules made thereunder. It is clear

therefore the Minister empowered to make rules prescribing the time limit of 30

days from the date of the award within period an appeal had to be filed with the

registrar and also to fix the appeal deposit which under rule 49 (xii) (a) had

been fixed at Rs. 50/- or 10% of the sum awarded against the petitioner

whichever sum was higher.

I am therefore of the view that Rule 49 (xii) (a) is the rule that had been framed

under Section 61(2)(y) by the Minister and does not circumscribe the right of

appeal granted under section 58(3) of the Law as the rule making powers of the

Minister entitles the Minister in terms of the Law to prescribe forms, fees to be

paid and procedure to be observed.

11

Nevertheless, in Sebestian Fernandos case, both their Lordships Fernando J.8

and Kulatunga J.9 observed that the finding in Somaratnes case regarding the

requirement of an appeal deposit being intra vires appears to be obiter.

The word appear connotes the meaning something become visible or

noticeable, especially, without apparent cause. This clearly does not convey a

strong degree of certainty in the mind of a judge. Chinua Asuzu, in his work titled

Judicial Writing: A Benchmark for the Bench10, states that a conclusion in a

judgement should state the disposition with maximum clarity and maximum

freedom from ambiguity. Therefore, it is my humble opinion that Their

Lordships did not reach a definitive finding on this matter.

In light of the analysis provided above, the resulting position is that in

Somaratnes case, three judges of the Supreme Court held that Rule 49(xii) is

intra vires, which constitutes the ratio decidendi of the judgment. In contrast, in

Sebestian Fernandos case, both judgments expressed that the Rule is ultra vires;

however, these statements were obiter dicta.

This is an appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Galle, where the

Appellant challenged the decision of the Commissioner of the Co-operative

Development Department of the Southern Province in a Writ application. The

learned High Court Judge refused to issue the Writs.

As observed by His Lordship Janak De Silva J. sitting in the Court of Appeal (as

His Lordship then was), in Weegaswatta Dissanayaka Mudiyanselage

Lokubanda Dissanayaka v. Co-operative Development and Three Others

(C.A.)11, the vires of a rule made by a Minister cannot be challenged in a

Provincial High Court. His Lordship concluded:

8 At page 346.

9 At page 356. 10 Partidge publishing, at p.199. 11 C.A. case No. CA/PHC/12/2014, decided on 05.10.2018.

12

Rule 49 (xii)(a) was made under the Co-operative Societies Law No. 5 of 1972

by the relevant Minister of the central government. He was exercising a power

given under a law in the whole country and not only within the Central Province.

Hence it could not have been the subject matter of a direct attack as to its vires

in the Provincial High Court of the Central Province by way of judicial review.

There is a general rule in the construction of Statutes that what a Court or

person is prohibited from doing directly, it may not do indirectly or in a

circuitous manner. [Bandaranaike v. Weeraratne and others (1981) 1 Sri L.R.

10 at page 16]. Therefore, I am of the view that the vires of Rule 49 (xii) (a) is

not open for collateral attack in proceedings before the Provincial High Court.

This finding is sufficient to reject the argument made by the learned counsel for

the Appellant on the vires of Rule 49 (xii) (a).

This finding is sufficient to reject the argument made by the learned counsel for

the Appellant regarding the vires of Rule 49(xii)(a).

The learned Counsel for the Appellant cited the judgment in W.S. Siripala v. The

Elpitiya Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd. and Three Others (C.A.)12,

(hereinafter referred to as the Siripala case) where His Lordship Hector Yapa J.

(with whom Upali de Z. Gunawardana J. concurred) set aside the orders of the

learned High Court Judge and the Commissioner of Co-operative Development

and the Registrar of Co-operative Societies, Galle, by considering the vires of

Rule 49(xii). This case, similar to the one at hand, involved an Appellant who

failed to make the required deposit in accordance with Rule 49(xii), resulting in

the rejection of the Appeal by the Commissioner/Registrar under Rule 49(xii)(b).

I observe that, in the Siripala case, the Court did not analyze the vires of Rule

49(xii) independently but instead relied entirely on the observations made by the

Supreme Court in Sebestian Fernandos case. The final conclusion of the Court,

which states, in view of the submission of the learned Counsel based on the

decision of the Supreme Court referred to above, we allow the appeal and set

12 C.A. appeal No. 8/94 (PHC).

13

aside the order of the High Court dated 07.07.93 and the order of the 4th

respondent dated 19.06.92. We further direct the 4th respondent to entertain the

appeal against the order of the 2nd respondent dated 04.04.92 and come to a

decision very early, supports the position mentioned earlier. (Emphasis added)

As I have already stated above, the statement made in the Sebestian Fernando

judgment regarding the vires of Rule 49(xii)(a) is clearly obiter dictum.

Consequently, the aforementioned judgment of this Court would not serve as

judicial precedent for the case at hand.

Be that as it may, the learned State Counsel for the Respondent cited a series of

cases from this Court where the statement made in the Sebestian Fernando

judgment regarding the vires of Rule 49(xii)(a) was not followed.

In the case of K. H. Nanadani v. Matara District Co-operative Society Ltd &

three others (C.A.)13, His Lordship L.T.B. Dehideniya J. sitting in the Court of

Appeal (as His Lordship then was) held that, although in the Sebestian Fernando

case their Lordships discussed the vires of Rule 49(xii) and noted that a serious

question had arisen, this issue was referred to the Court of Appeal for

determination, and the Supreme Court did not hold that Rule 49(xii) is ultra

vires.

In the case of Duminda Lakunusara Bandara Udugama v. Commissioner of Co-

operative Development and Registrar of Co-operative Societies and two others

(C.A.)14, His Lordship A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J. sitting in the Court of Appeal

(as His Lordship then was) held that compliance with the requirement of

depositing the amount stipulated in Rule 49(xii)(a) is a mandatory prerequisite

for pursuing an appeal. Consequently, if the Appellant fails to make the required

deposit, the appeal must be rejected.

13 C.A. case No. CA/PHC/146/2004, decided in October 2016. 14 C.A. case No. CA/PHC/200/2014, decided on 27.06.2019.

14

In the case of Dharmarathna Wasam Palliyage Sampath Manjula Nanayakkara

v. Commissioner of Co-operative Development & Registrar of Co-operative

Societies (Central Province) (C.A.)15, Her Ladyship P.R. Walgama, J., after

considering the arguments raised by the Appellant regarding the vires of Rule

49(xii)(a), held that Section 61(1) of the Co-operative Societies Law No. 5 of

1972 empowers the Minister to make rules, and Section 61(2)(y) specifically

provides for the formulation of Rules regarding the forms, fees, procedure, and

other matters connected with the presentation, hearing, and disposal of appeals.

Her Ladyship concluded that the observations made in the Sebestian Fernando

case concerning Rule 49(xii)(a) cannot be regarded as the ratio decidendi of that

case16. Instead, she chose to follow the decision in Somaratne's case, where it

was held that the Rule is intra vires.

Her Ladyship P.R. Walgama J. reached a similar conclusion in the subsequent

case of A.D. Samarasinghe Abeyawardene v. Co-operative Commissioner of

Southern Province and another17 regarding the vires of Rule 49(xii)(a). In this

case, the Appellant argued that since Rule 49(xii)(a) specifies two potential

amounts for the appeal deposit, Rs. 50 or 10% of the sum awarded, the Appellant

should be entitled to deposit either of the two amounts. However, the Court

rejected this argument, reasoning that the Rule explicitly states that the deposit

must be the higher of the two sums. This interpretation emphasizes the

mandatory nature of the requirement, reinforcing the position that the Appellant

must comply with the stipulation as outlined in the Rule.

In my opinion, when the law stipulates a pre-condition for filing an appeal, that

condition must be satisfied before the Appeal is submitted for it to be considered

valid in law.

The facts of the case, as outlined in the judgment, reveal that the learned High

Court Judge in the Writ application had granted the Appellant an opportunity to

15 C.A. case No. CA./PHC/24/09, decided on 10.06.2016. 16 Supra note 2. 17 C.A. case No. CA/PHC/20/2004, decided on 13.09.2016.

15

deposit the remaining balance required under the Rule as the appeal deposit.

However, the Court of Appeal rejected the Appellant's entitlement on the basis

that the Supreme Court's decision in the Sebastian Fernandos case, which

allowed time for the Appellant to pay the remaining 10% deposit, was merely

obiter dicta18.

Relying on this, the learned Counsel for the Appellant contended that the

Appellant in the present case should similarly have been given a chance to make

the deposit.

However, I am unable to find any such statement in the Sebastian Fernando

judgment. As a result, it is clear that there is no judicial precedent supporting the

granting an opportunity to remedy the deposit deficiency. Accordingly, I hold

that no judicial precedents exist to permit the Appellant to rectify the defects in

the appeal deposit, and doing so would also contravene the Rules.

Principle of stare decisis

In light of the above analysis, I conclude that, despite the Court of Appeal

repeatedly asserting that the obiter dicta in Sebestian Fernandos case, which

states that Rule 49 (xii)(a) is ultra vires, and the Supreme Court's determination

in Somaratnes case that the Rule is intra vires, the same question continues to

be reagitated in appeals, as seen in this case. Specifically, His Lordship Janak de

Silva J. has thoroughly analyzed both judgments, preferring to follow the latter,

which affirms that Rule 49 (xii)(a) is intra vires.

In this context, I am of the view that rearguing the same issue before this Court

in appeals, without pursuing appropriate legal avenues to challenge the Rule, is

an unproductive practice that wastes the Court's energy and resources. Such

conduct should be discouraged.

18 Pages 6 and 7 of the Judgement.

16

In the case of Walker Sons & Co. (U.K.) Ltd. v. Gunathilake and Others19,

Thamotheram J. observed, after considering the judgment of Basnakyake C.J. in

Bandahamy v. Senanayake20, that as a rule, two judges sitting together could

follow a previous decision of two judges but where two judges sitting together

are unable to agree with a decision of a similar bench, the practice is to reserve

the case for the decision of a fuller bench.

Conclusion

In light of the above analysis, I find that the learned High Court Judge, in his

Order dated 29th January 2021, has appropriately examined the relevant facts,

statutory provisions, and judicial precedents. He has arrived at a just conclusion

in dismissing the application for the prerogative Writs sought by the Appellant.

Therefore, I dismiss this appeal, subject to a cost of Rs. 25,000/-.
