Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an application by the complainant-petitioner, namely, The Director

General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

invoking the revisionary jurisdiction granted to this Court in terms of Article 138

of The Constitution of The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

When this matter was supported for notice, after having considered the petition

and other relevant documents, and the submission of the learned Counsel for

the complainant-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the petitioner), this Court

decided to grant notice in relation to this application.

The accused-respondent (hereinafter referred to as the respondent) filed

objections to the application and at the hearing of this application, both parties

agreed that the Case No. CPA-0135-22, which is also an application filed

invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court by the petitioner, challenging

an order very much similar to the order challenged in this application before the

Court. As such, both parties agreed that both these applications can be

considered together and the respective judgements can be pronounced

accordingly. Hence the applications before this Court in this matter as well in

Case No. CPA-0135-22 was considered together and concluded.

At the conclusion of the oral arguments, both sides were allowed to file written

submissions as well, and both the learned Counsel filed comprehensive written

submissions for the consideration of the Court.

This is a matter where the petitioner has instituted an action before the High

Court of Colombo against the respondent in the High Court of Colombo Case No.

HCB/62/2020, for solicitation of a sum of Rs. 30000/= and accepting a sum of

Page 4 of 17

Rs. 20000/= as a gratification from a person in relation to the issuing of a land

permit, which was an offence punishable in terms of section 19 (b) and 19 (c) of

the Bribery Act.

Upon the receipt of the indictment, the respondent had been noticed to appear

before the High Court and the indictment had been served. However, before the

indictment could be read over to the respondent, the learned Counsel for the

respondent has raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of the

indictment before the High Court.

The objection raised had been on the basis that in terms of section 3 of the

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act No. 19 of

1994 (hereinafter referred to as the Act.), to conduct an investigation into a

complaint received by the Commission, there shall be a directive signed by all

three members of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption (hereinafter referred to as the Commission).

It was on the basis that all three Commissioners had not given a directive to

commence an investigation in this action, and therefore, any indictment filed on

the basis of an investigation carried out on a directive given by one Commissioner

would vitiate any proceeding or institution of an indictment, this objection has

been raised.

The learned High Court Judge of Colombo having considered the above

preliminary objection, had agreed with the said objection and, accordingly, of his

order dated 23-09-2022 has discharged the respondent from the charges

preferred against him.

He has determined that the failure by all three Commissioners to sign and give

a directive to commence investigations in relation to this offence was a defect

that goes to the root of the matter, which has the effect of nullifying the

indictment.

Page 5 of 17

It is against this order the petitioner has come before this Court by way of this

revision application.

At the hearing of the application, the learned Counsel for the petitioner admitted

that all three Commissioners had not signed the order to investigate the

complaint against the respondent, but only one Commissioner. However, it was

her submission that there is no such requirement for all three Commissioners

to sign such a directive to commence an investigation.

It was also her view that in any way, since the Director General of the

Commission has filed this indictment based on the directive given to him by the

commission in terms of section 11 of the Act. The High Court has no power to

question the validity of the indictment, and it is only before the Supreme Court,

in terms of section 24 of the Act, any such challenge can be made.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner relied on several judgements and orders

pronounced by this Court on the above basis, and argued that Anoma S.

Polwatte Vs. The Director General of the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and Others- SC Writ Application No.

1/2011 decided on 26-07-2018, the judgement relied on heavily by the learned

High Court Judge to hold with the arguments presented on behalf of the

respondent, has no application to the preliminary objection raised and the issues

considered by the learned High Court Judge.

Citing several sections of the Act, it was her view that commencing of an

investigation is a power granted to the Commission in terms of the Act, and such

power can be delegated to the officers of the Commission by any member of the

Commission sitting together or separately.

It was her contention that the learned High Court Judge was misdirected when

it was determined, based on the ratio decidendi of Anoma Polwatte Case

(Supra), the consent of all three Commissioners to file action, as well as to

commence investigation, comes within the functions of the Commission in terms

Page 6 of 17

of section 3 of the Act and for such a function to be legally binding, all three

Commissioners directive must be available.

The learned Counsel for the petitioner relied on the judgement pronounced by

the Supreme Court in the case of Indikatiya Hewage Kusumadasa Mahanama

And Another Vs. The Commission To Investigate Allegations of Bribery or

Corruption And Another SC, TAB-1A & 1B/2020, decided on 11-01-2023,

where it has been determined that once the Director General of the Commission

forwards an indictment under section 12 (1) and (2) of the Act, and if the Director

General is directed under section 11 of the Act by the Commission to forward an

indictment, in the absence of any complaint that the Director General has failed

to comply with section 12 (1) and (2) of the Act when forwarding the indictment

before the High Court, it is correct in refusing any jurisdictional objection raised

in that regard, as any such challenge could only be raised in an appropriate

action filed before an appropriate forum.

The learned Counsel for the respondent was of the view that any indictment filed

in a High Court should be in accordance with the relevant law, and by following

the due process. He strenuously argued that the process of investigations,

including commencement of an investigation in terms of the Act shall deem to

be a function of the Commission in terms of section 3 of the Act.

Citing the provisions of section 5 of the Act, he was of the view that section 2 (8)

of the Act relied on by the learned Counsel for the petitioner to argue that the

powers of the Commission can be exercised by the Commissioners sitting

together or separately, shall be applicable only in relation to the situations

mentioned in section 5 of the Act and for nothing else.

He was of the view that under the above context, the judgement in Anoma

Polwatte (Supra) becomes relevant as it has been determined that institution of

proceedings which falls under the ambit of section 3 shall be with the directive

of all three Commissioners, therefore, investigations as to the allegations of

bribery or corruption which is also a function in terms of section 3, shall also be

Page 7 of 17

by the directive of all three Commissioners and not by a single Commissioner

acting alone.

He defended the order of the learned High Court Judge on the basis that it has

been reached after considering the relevant provisions of the law, and was of the

view that it need not be disturbed.

Both the Counsels cited several judgements decided by our Superior Courts, as

well as the Courts in similar jurisdictions, and also the Hansard of the

Parliament in support of their respective arguments.

It needs to be noted that this Court is highly appreciative of the valuable

contributions made by both the learned Counsel in assisting the Court to reach

the final determination in relation to this application.

I will now proceed to consider the contention of the petitioner that an objection

of this nature in relation to an indictment filed before the High Court by the

Director General of the Commission having followed the provisions of section 12

(1) and (2) cannot be challenged before the High Court itself.

As pointed out by the learned Counsel for the petitioner, another division of this

Court in CA Application No 85/2022 decided on 04-04-2023 has determined

that such an objection has to be raised only in terms of section 24 of the Act,

and the Court of Appeal or the High Court is not the forum to challenge an

indictment filed before the High Court.

The Court of Appeal has taken guidance from the five-Judge bench judgement

in the case of Indikatiya Hewage Kusumadasa Mahanama and Another Vs.

The Commission To Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (supra),

where, after having considered a similar objection, their Lordships of the

Supreme Court observed thus;

When considering the submission referred to above, it is clear that the said

grounds of appeal raised on behalf of the 2nd accused-appellant were based

on a misrepresentation given to the decision of this Court in the case of

Page 8 of 17

Anoma S. Polwatte Vs. The Director General of the Commission to

Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption and Others (supra).

As already observed by us, when deciding the above case, this Court had

never intended to impose an additional requirement of submitting a written

directive given by the commission when forwarding an indictment by the

Director General CIABOC to High Court other than following the provision

already identified under section 12 (1) and (2) of the CIABOC Act. If the

Director General is directed under section 11 of the CIABOAC Act by the

CIABOC to forward an indictment, he is only bound to follow the provisions

of section 12 (1) and (2) of the CIABOC Act. In the absence of any complaint

that the Director General CIABOC had failed to comply with sections 12 (1)

and (2) of the CIABOC Act when forwarding the indictment before the High

Court at Bar, it is correct in refusing the jurisdictional objection raised on

behalf of the 2nd accused before the High Court at Bar. The trial Judge before

whom the indictment is filed is therefore bound to accept the indictment and

take up the trial unless there is material to establish that Director General

CIABOC had failed to comply with the provisions of section 12 (1) and (2) of

the CIABOC Act. Any party who intends to challenge an indictment

forwarded by the Director General CIABOC on the basis that the CIABOC

had failed to comply with section 11 of the CIABOC Act, the said challenge

would only be raised in an appropriate action filed before an appropriate

forum.

The appropriate action mentioned in the above observation refers to filing of an

application in terms of section 24 of the Act invoking the Writ jurisdiction of the

Supreme Court in order to quash any directive given in terms of section 11 of

the Act to institute criminal proceedings, and the appropriate forum mentioned

is the Supreme Court as section 24 of the Act has taken away the jurisdiction

Page 9 of 17

vested in Court of Appeal by Article 140 of The Constitution in relation to issuing

of writs in relation to the matters under the Act.

However, it needs to be noted that the learned High Court Judge did not have

the benefit of considering the above-mentioned judgement as the Supreme Court

judgement was pronounced only on 11-01-2023, whereas, the order pronounced

by the learned High Court Judge in relation to the preliminary objection was on

23-09-2022.

Be that as it may, it clearly appears that the learned High Court Judge has been

guided by the judgement in Anoma Polwatte (Supra) where it was determined

that the institution of proceedings under the Bribery Act or The Declaration of

Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975 is a function of the Commission, and

such a function shall be exercised by all three members of the Commission.

Having considered the relevant law in that regard, the learned High Court Judge

has determined that investigating allegations contained in communications

made to the Commission should also come within the interpretation of a function

in terms of section 3 of the Act, and the indictment should be dismissed as all

three Commissioners had not ordered the investigation in relation to the offences

mentioned in the indictment.

Although Anoma Polwatte Case (Supra) was a matter decided on the basis that

directing the institution of proceedings in terms of the Bribery Act or The

Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975 is a function of the

Commission and, therefore, the directive of all three Commissioners must be an

essential prerequisite to file an action, it appears that the learned High Court

Judge has gone further by relying on the judgement of Anoma S. Polwatte

(Supra) to interpret the commencement of an investigation in terms of the Act

shall also be by a directive of all three Commissioners, and any investigation

carried out without such a directive should have a vitiating effect on an

indictment filed based on such an investigation.

Page 10 of 17

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the relevant section 3 of the Act which

refers to the functions of the Commission relied on by the learned High Court

Judge in his determination.

3. The commission shall subject to the other provisions of this Act,

investigate allegations, contained in the communications made to it

under section 4 and where any such investigation discloses the

commission of any offence by any person under the Bribery Act or

The Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Law No. 1 of 1975, direct the

institution of proceedings against such person for such offence in the

appropriate Court.

Anoma Polwatte Case (Supra) was a Writ application filed before the Supreme

Court seeking Writs in the nature of Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus in

terms of section 24 (1) of the Act challenging the institution of proceedings

against Anoma S. Polwatte in the Magistrates Court under the provisions of

section 78(1) of the Bribery Act.

It was held by the Supreme Court that there are functions and powers granted

to the Commission by the Act and only the powers can be exercised by the

members of the Commission sitting together or separately. However, the function

of instituting proceedings shall be exercised only by all the members of the

Commission.

Their Lordships of the Supreme Court having considered section 2 (8), section 3

and section 5, of the Act has observed as follows;

When looking at the provisions of the above 3 provisions of the act, it is

clear that by the above provisions, a clear distinction had been between the

powers of the Commission and functions of the Commission. As identified in

section 3 referred to above, when an offence is disclosed after an

investigation, Commission shall direct the institution of proceedings and the

Page 11 of 17

said conduct of the Commission had been identified within the functions of

the Commission. The powers of the Commission have been identified under

section 5 of the Act and under section 2 (8), such powers of the Commission

may be exercised by its members either sitting together or separately.

Thus, it is clear that the members of the Commission can exercise ancillary

powers on his own though the full complement of the Commission is not

available at one give time, but for the exercise of functions such as the

direction to be given to the Director General, it is crystal clear that the act

has not provided for one member alone to give such direction.

The above observations of their Lordships of the Supreme Court, clearly shows

that the focus had been on the function of instituting of proceedings before a

Court of law, and that it should be exercised by all three members of the

Commission.

Since the Polwatte (Supra) judgement has not provided clear directions as to

the commencement of an investigation by the Commission should also by way of

a directive by all three members of the Commission, it becomes necessary for

this Court to consider whether the learned High Court Judge was correct in

extending the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in the Anoma Polwatte

(Supra) judgement to dismiss the indictment.

If one takes the face value of section 3 of the Act, it may be argued that,

investigate allegations and institution of proceedings are the two functions

granted to the Bribery Commission and both the functions shall need the

approval of all three Commissioners.

However, it is my considered view that if one goes through the other relevant

sections of the Act, the intention of the legislature in formulating the provisions

of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Act had

not been that.

Page 12 of 17

Section 3 of the Act begins by stating that The commission shall, subject to

the other provisions of this Act., in other words, section 3 needs to be

interpreted in relation to the other provisions contained in the Act as to the

investigating of allegations of bribery and corruption and institution of

proceedings.

As the function of institution of proceedings had been interpreted and

determined by the Supreme Court, my focus in this judgement is on the

investigating allegations aspect in relation to the provisions of the Act.

It is my considered view that the powers of the Commission cannot be confined

to powers specifically granted to it in terms of section 5 of the Act, which relates

to the powers granted to it in discharging the functions assigned to it by this Act.

The provisions of the Act are very much clear that the powers mentioned under

section 5 are not the only powers granted to the Commission in terms of the Act.

Section 4 (3) of the Act reads as follows;

4.(3) The Commission shall have the power to investigate any matters

disclosed by a communication received by it under subsection (1)

whether or not such matters relate to a period to the appointed date

and not withstanding anything to the contrary in any other law. (the

emphasis is mine)

Section 16 (3) of the Act reads as follows;

16.(3) The Commission may delegate to the Director General or any

other officer appointed to assist the Commission any of its powers

[other than the powers referred to in paragraphs (i), (j), (k) and (l) of

subsection (1) of section 5, section 11, and this section] and the

person to whom such powers are delegated may exercise those powers

subject to the direction of the Commission. (the emphasis is mine)

Page 13 of 17

It is my view that the above considered sections provide that powers of the

Commission shall not be confined to the areas mentioned in section 5 of the Act,

but investigating allegations of bribery or corruption made to the Commission is

also a power vested in the Commission, although that has been mentioned under

the functions of the Commission as well.

In that regard, it is abundantly clear that the legislature by its wisdom has

provided for the members of the Commission to exercise its powers sitting

together or separately.

The relevant section 2 (8) of the Act reads as follows;

2(8)- The members of the Commission may exercise the powers

conferred on the Commission either sitting together or separately

and where a member of the Commission exercises any such power

sitting separately, his acts shall be deemed to be the act of the

Commission.

It is trite law that statutes should be construed as far as possible to avoid

absurdity or futility.

I would like to quote from the judgement of Sharvananda, J. (as he was then) in

the case of Nandasena Vs. Senanayake And Another (1981) 1 SLR 238 at page

245.

Statutes should be construed, as far as possible, to avoid absurdity or

futility. A statute should be construed in a manner to give it validity rather

than invalidity- ut res magis valeat cuam pereat. As Lord Dunedin stated in

Whitney Vs. Inland Revenue Commissioner (1925) AC 27, 52, A statute is

designed to be workable, and the interpretation thereof should be to secure

that object, unless crucial omission or clear direction makes that end

unattainable. A similar view was expressed by Lord Simon L.C. in Noles

Vs. Don Caster Amalgamated Collieres Ltd (1940) AC 1014, 1023 in the

Page 14 of 17

words: If the choice is between two interpretations, the narrower of which

would fail to achieve the manifest purpose of the legislation, we should

avoid a construction which would reduce the legislature to futility and

should rather accept the bolder construction based on the view that

parliament would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective

result. Lord Reid enunciated the same view in Luke Vs. Inland Revenue

Commissioner (1963) 1 ALL ER 655, 664 How then are we to resolve this

difficulty? To apply the word literally is to defeat the obvious intention of the

legislature and to produce a wholly unreasonable result. To achieve the

obvious intention and produce a reasonable result, we should do some

violence to the words. This is not a new problem The general principle is

well settled. It is only where the words are absolutely incapable of

construction which will accord with the apparent intention of the provision

and avoid a wholly unreasonable result that the words of the enactment

must prevail.

It is thus legitimate and proper to read and rely upon such a principle as

this: Where the language of a statute in its ordinary meaning and

grammatical construction leads to manifest contradiction of the apparent

purpose of the enactment, or to cause inconvenience or absurdity, hardship

or injustice, presumably not intended, a construction may be put upon it

which modifies the meaning of the words and even the structure of the

sentence. (Maxwell Interpretation of Statues, 10th Ed. at p. 229) A

purposive approach to the construction of relevant section of the law avoids

the futility apprehended by Counsel and enables the statutory objective to

be achieved.

If this Court is to accept the argument that the powers vested with the

Commission shall be limited to what is stated in section 5 of the Act and

investigating allegations of bribery or corruption shall be a function where all

three Commissioners must perform the said function, and ordering of a

commencement of an investigation must also be by all three Commissioners as

Page 15 of 17

determined by the learned High Court Judge, I am of the view that the purpose

of enacting the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption

Act. No. 19 of 1994 and also the Bribery Act would not be serving its purpose.

An allegation of bribery or corruption against a person can come at any moment

which require prompt investigations without any delay whatsoever. There may

be situations where not initiating prompt investigations would result in the

failure to apprehend the culprit or culprits.

Under such circumstances, if the intention of the legislature was to obtain the

sanction of all three Commissioners to commence an investigation, in a situation

where all three Commissioners are not available at a given time to allow

investigations as to a complaint received by the Commission, there is no need to

say that such a requirement would be futile and an absurdity.

Article 156A enacted by the 19th Amendment to The Constitution where the

enabling provisions for the establishment of a Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption has been introduced, clearly provides that

the intention of the legislature had been to provide powers for the Commission

to investigate allegations of bribery or corruption.

The relevant Article 156A (1) (b) reads as follows.

156A (1) (b)- The powers of the Commission including the power to

direct the holding of a preliminary inquiry or the making of an

investigation into an allegation of bribery or corruption whether of

its own motion or on a complaint made to it and the power to

institute prosecutions for offences under the law in force relating to

bribery or corruption.

The corresponding Article 156A (1) (b) of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution,

which is the provision now in effect reads as follows.

156A (1) (b). The powers of the Commission including the power to

direct the holding of a preliminary inquiry or the making of an

Page 16 of 17

investigation into an allegation of bribery or corruption whether of

its own motion or on a complaint made to it, and the power to

institute prosecutions for offences under the law in force relating to

bribery or corruption.

I am of the view that was the very reason why the legislature in its wisdom has

enacted section 4 (3), 16 (3) as well as section 2 (8) as sections where the powers

of the Commission to investigate have been referred to, other than the ancillary

powers granted to the Commission in terms of section 5 of the Act.

I am of the view that the other grounds argued by the learned Counsel for the

petitioner and countered by the learned Counsel for the respondent need not be

considered, as the determination of the learned High Court Judge to discharge

the respondent from the proceedings before the High Court cannot be allowed to

stand for the reasons considered as above.

The application before this Court being an application invoking the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, which is a discretionary remedy, it becomes

necessary for this Court to consider the conditions upon which the discretionary

remedy of revision can be granted.

In the case of Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd Vs. Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd

(1987) 1 SLR 5, it was held;

It is settled law that the exercise of revisionary powers of the appellate

Court is confined to cases in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

I find that the petitioner has established sufficient exceptional grounds before

this Court. I am of the view that this is a fit and proper case where this Court

should intervene exercising the discretionary remedy of revision vested in this

Court to interfere with the order of the learned High Court Judge for the reasons

as considered.

Page 17 of 17

Accordingly, the order dated 23-09-2022 of the learned High Court Judge of

Colombo is set aside as it cannot be allowed to stand.

The learned High Court Judge is directed to revert the case back to the case role

of the Court and issue notice on the respondent, read over the indictment to him,

and proceed therefrom to hear evidence if necessary, and conclude the matter.

The Registrar of the Court is directed to communicate this judgement to the High

Court of Colombo for necessary compliance.
