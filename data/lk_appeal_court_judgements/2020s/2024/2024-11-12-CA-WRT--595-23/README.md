r) Award substantial coast to the petitioner; and

s) Grant the Petitioner such other and further reliefs a to your Lordships

The facts of this are briefly as follows:

According to the Petitioner, at the time of the incident, the Petitioner was serving as the

Principal of Siyambalanduwa Maha Vidyalaya, Monaragala which is a National School.

According to the Petitioner on or around 23.08.2022, one Mrs. Wijesundara, the

Administrative Officer of Zonal Educational Office Monaragala visited the said school

with a group of parents and informed the Petitioner that some of the parents submitted a

Page 7 of 11

Petition against the Petitioner. Thereafter, there was a meeting held on 26.08.2022

organized by the School Development Society with the participation of the 1st Respondent

where certain parents made allegations against the Petitioner. Some of such allegations

were inefficient management of the school, deterioration of discipline of the students and

financial improprieties.

According to the Petitioner, as stated in paragraph 12 of the petition, the Chairman of the

Siyambalanduwa Pradeshiya Sabha has also sent a letter dated 13.03.2023 to the Director

of Education (National School) requesting to transfer the Petitioner to another School and

to appoint a new Principal to the said School making several other allegations against the

Petitioner. The Petitioner asserts that this was done by the Chairman as an act of revenge

relating to an incident where the Petitioner has refrained from endorsing the retention of

the Chairmans brother in a contract awarded to him coinciding with the National School

Ceremony.

The Petitioner states that, for her utter shock and dismay, the 2nd Respondent had

forwarded a letter dated 27.03.2023 signed by the 1st Respondent informing the Petitioner

that she has been temporarily assigned to the Divisional Education Office

Siyambalanduwa with immediate effect. The Petitioner further avers that, despite all the

hardships, the Petitioner commenced her work at the said office from 28.03.2023.

The Petitioner states that, due to the hardships faced by her by travelling to the new

workplace which is located 20 km away from her residence, and the expenses incurred

due to the transportation, she informed the 1st Respondent by letter dated 13.03.2023

requesting to grant permission to her to retire 3 months before the due date. However,

the Respondents have not granted the permission. The Petitioner further states, that

since no reply was received for the earlier letters, the Petitioner sent another letter dated

22.08.2023 to the 1st Respondent indicating that she wishes to revoke her request and

Page 8 of 11

wishes to work for one more year. The Petitioner moreover states that the Petitioner also

filed a complaint to the Human Rights Commission against the 1st Respondent. The

Petitioner has further requested the 1st Respondent to provide her an investigation report

which was purported to be held and the 1st Respondent informed her that he was unable

to provide such an investigation report as the preliminary investigation is still ongoing.

Thereafter, the Petitioner had made an appeal to the Uva Provincial Public Service

Commission against the decision of the 1st Respondent. In the meantime, the Petitioner

has come to know that the 1st Respondent has taken steps to hold a disciplinary inquiry

against her. It should be noted that the 5th Respondent, the Secretary to the Ministry of

Education, Isurupaya in his Statements of Objection in averment 5 has stated that, the

school in which the Petitioner was the Principal was declared as a National School,

therefore, the Uva Provincial Public Service Commission is not vested with the power to

intervene about the disciplinary matters regarding the Petitioner. Further, through the

letter marked as 5R2, the staff of the said school are deemed to have been absorbed by the

Central Government.

It should be noted that the decision to transfer the Petitioner was made by the 3rd

Respondent who is the Director of Education, Uva Province.

The question is whether the 3rd Respondent has the legal authority to take steps to

transfer the Petitioner and to initiate the disciplinary inquiry.

Sunil F.A. Coorey in his book Principles of Administrative Law, Fourth Edition, Volume

II, page 916 states as follows:

Power to decide questions affecting right of parties may be conferred either by

statute law or by contract of parties.

The phrase legal authority in this context has traditionally been used to refer

only conferred by statute, to the exclusion of power conferred by contract of

parties.

Page 9 of 11

According to Appendix III of the Ninth Schedule (Provincial Council List) of the

Constitution, Section 3 reads as follows:

The transfer and disciplinary control of all educational personnel, i.e. Teachers,

Principals and Education Officers, Officers belonging to a National Service but

serving the Provincial Authority on secondment will have the right of appeal to the

Public Service Commission. Officers belonging to the Provincial Public Service will

have a right to appeal to the Public Service Commission against dismissal.

Further, it is discussed by Sunil F.A.Coorey in Principles of Administrative Law in Sri

Lanka (Supra) at Page 911 that;

The circumstances in which certiorari and prohibition will be available have been

summed up by Lord Justice Atkin, an English judge, in the following famous words

which on numerous occasions have been cited and followed by our courts:

" Whenever any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions

affecting the rights of subjects, and having the duty to act judicially, act in excess

of their legal authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the King's

Bench Division exercised in these Writs."

This dictum has been analyzed as follows as laying down four conditions which

must be satisfied for certiorari or prohibition to issue:-

" Whenever any body of persons, (firstly) having legal authority, (secondly) to

determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, (thirdly) having the duty to

act judicially, (fourthly) act in excess of their legal authority, they are subject to

the controlling jurisdiction exercised by these writs."

In Regina v. National Joint Council for The Craft of Dental Technicians, 1953, QB Volume

I, Lord Goddard C.J held that,

But the bodies to which in modern times the remedies of these prerogative writs

have been applied have all been statutory bodies on whom parliament has

conferred statutory Powers and duties which, when exercised, may lead to the

detriment of subjects who may have to submit to their jurisdiction.

Page 10 of 11

This was further elaborated by His Lordship Sripavan, J (as he was then) in Daewoo

Engineering and Construction Co. Ltd. v. Amarasekara, (2006) 2 SLR 232, at page 234

that;

An objection was taken by the President's Counsel for the eighth respondent that

the court has no jurisdiction to quash a decision taken by the Cabinet of Ministers.

In terms of Article 4(c) of the Constitution, the judicial power of the People is

exercised through courts, tribunals and institutions created, established, or

recognized by the Constitution or created and established by law. The power to

issue writs against a judge of any Court of First Instance, tribunal or other

institution or any other person is conferred on the Court of Appeal in terms of

Article 140 of the Constitution. Section 2 of the Interpretation Ordinance provides

that "person" includes "any body of persons corporate or unincorporate". Thus, this

court has jurisdiction to issue writs on a body of persons according to law. In Rex

vs Electricity Commissioners at 204, the writ of certiorari was declared to be

available against "any body of persons having legal authority to determine the

questions affecting the rights of the subjects and having the duty to act judicially".

In other words, certiorari lies only against persons or tribunals, the source of whose

authority to make decisions or orders affecting the rights of subjects, is legal.

Commenting on the phrase "Legal authority" Lord Goddard C. J. In Rex vs.

National Joint Council for Dental Technician(2) at 707 said "Legal authority

generally means statutory authority".

The concept of having legal authority was considered by His Lordship Vythialingam, J

in Mendis, Fowzie and Others v. Goonewardena, G.P.A. Silva, (1978-1979) 2 SLR 322,

at page 333, that;

An examination of the process by which this has been done and to see how

Lord Atkin's formula has been modified is best done by considering each of the

four parts into which Slesser, L J divided in the case of R. V. London Country

Council;, Namely that whenever any body of persons (1) having legal authority

(2) to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects, and

(3) having the duty to act judicially

(4) act in excess of their legal authority

Page 11 of 11

they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of the King's Bench Division

exercised in these writs.

Having Legal Authority

In this context generally "legal authority" means statutory authority or

authority under the common law. But this has now been extended to include

acts of public authorities who are not vested with any power under any statute or

under the common law. In the case Ex parte Lain (supra) it was argued that

the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board was not a body of persons having

"legal authority" in the sense of having statutory authority, as the Board

had been established by the executive in terms of a White Paper which had

been adopted by Parliament. The Court of Appeal rejected this argument and

held that it had legal authority to act. Mr. Choksy pointed out that the Court

of Appeal's decision in that case was based on the fact that the Board had been

set up by the executive in the exercise of the prerogative and that therefore it

had a legal basis.

From the Objections raised by the 5th Respondent, it is quite apparent that the transfer

and the disciplinary inquiry were not delegated to the Provincial Public Service

Commission. Therefore, the decision taken by the 3rd Respondent by letter dated

27.03.2023 is without legal authority, thus it is illegal.

We thus, issue writs of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 3rd Respondent. We further

issue writs of Prohibition as prayed for in prayers (h) and (i) of the Petition.

Application allowed with costs.
