But this court observes that the defence witness had been led at the request of the appellant and only the examination in chief had taken place and the cross examination had been postponed to another date. The trial judge has not asked a single question. The cross examination had in fact taken place after two months, therefore the Attorney General had plenty of time to study the examination in chief and cross examine the witness. Therefore, the absence of the state counsel has not caused any prejudice to either party, but we note that the Attorney general has also not objected to the proceedings in pg.212 on a subsequent date. The counsel for the appellant submitted a lengthy written submission on this and has quoted many Indian judgements.",
