Thereafter, the Petitioners mother, R.M. Muthumenike, had been issued a Grant marked P3 in respect of the subject land on 09.04.1984. Said R.M. Muthumenike has nominated the Petitioner, 5th and 6th Respondents as the successors to the subject land. Said nomination has been registered in the Register of Permits /Grants maintained in terms of the Land Development Ordinance. Copy of such registration extract has been submitted by the Petitioner marked as P5. The Petitioner states that the said nomination made by his mother Muthumenike, is contrary to the provisions of Sections 48A and 75 of the Land Development Ordinance and Regulations 143 and 144 of the Land Manual. Further, the Petitioner states that the Respondents arbitrarily and unjustifiably refrained from discharging their public duty under the Mahaweli Authority Act No. 23 of 1979 read with Section 48A of the Land Development Ordinance and Regulations under the Land Manual in failing to execute a Grant exclusively in favour of the Petitioner.",
