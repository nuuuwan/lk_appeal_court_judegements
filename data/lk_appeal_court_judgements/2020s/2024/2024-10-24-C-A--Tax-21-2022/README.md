Argued on: 21.02.2024 and 01.04.2024

Decided on: 24.10.2024

S. U. B. Karalliyadde, J.

The Appellant in the instant case stated The Colombo Fort and Building PLC is a public

limited liability company incorporated in Sri Lanka. By the letter dated 26.11.2013,1 it

has submitted the tax return for the assessment year 2012/2013. The Assessor, by the

letter dated 07.09.20152 informed the Appellant that the tax return cannot be accepted

for the reason that the Appellant is engaged in the business of investing shares in

companies and therefore as dividend and interest income of the Appellant company

being an investing company should be treated as a part of trading profit as per Section

3(a) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (the Act).

The Appellant received the Notice of Assessment dated 12.11.20153 and by the letter

dated 09.12.20154, the Appellant appealed against it to the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue (the Respondent) against the said assessment. The Respondent by his

determination dated 17.11.20175 confirmed the said assessment. Being aggrieved by

the said determination of the Respondent, by the Petition dated 26.02.2018 the

Appellant appealed to the Tax Appeals Commission (the TAC). The TAC by its

5 at page 01 of the appeal brief.

determination dated 04.04.2022,6 confirmed the decision of the Respondent. It is

against the said determination of the TAC, the Appellant requested the TAC to state a

case on the following questions of law for the opinion of this Court in terms of Section

170(6) of the Act.

i. Is the Assessment (and the determination of the Commissioner General, and the

determination of the Tax Appeals Commission pursuant to same) liable to be

quashed and/or annulled inasmuch as the Assessor purporting to assess the

Appellant and/or issuing Notice of Assessment on the Appellant was not the

Assessor who purported to provide 'reasons' therefor?

ii. Is the Assessment, (and the determination of the Commissioner General, and the

determination of the Tax Appeals Commission pursuant to same) liable to be

quashed and / or annulled inasmuch as the Assessor failed to duly provide reasons

for the Assessment as required by Section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No.

10 of 2006 (as amended)?

iii. Did the Assessor, the Commissioner-General, and the Tax Appeals Commission,

err in law in failing to recognize that the Appellant functioned as a Holding

Company as opposed to an Investment Company?

iv. Was the interest earned by the Appellant liable to be considered as 'income'

within Section 3(e) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended),

and NOT within Section 3(a) of the said Act?

6 at page 266 of the appeal brief.

4

v. Did the Assessor, the Commissioner General, and the Tax Appeal Commission,

err in law in falling to give due credit in respect of withholding tax paid by the

Appellant in respect of interest received?

vi. Were the dividends earned by the Appellant, in the first instance, liable to be

considered as 'income' within Section 3(e) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of

2006 (as amended), and NOT within Section 3(a) of the said Act?

vii. Did the dividends earned by the Appellant not form part of its statutory income

in view of the provisions of Section 63 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006

(as amended)?

viii. Is the Assessment, (and the Determination of the Commissioner General, and the

Determination of the Tax Appeals Commission, thereon) contrary to law?

ix. In view of the evidence and material before the Tax Appeals Commission, did the

Tax Appeals Commission err in law in arriving at the conclusions set out in its

determination?

This Court addresses the questions of law as follows.

Question of Law I

Is the Assessment, (and the determination of the Commissioner General, and the

determination of the Tax Appeals Commission pursuant to same) liable to be

quashed and / or annulled inasmuch as the Assessor purporting to assess the

Appellant and/or issuing Notice of Assessment on the Appellant was not the

Assessor who purported to provide 'reasons' therefor?

5

The Appellant has drawn the attention of the Court that the letter of intimation dated

07.09.20157 which sets out the reasons for the assessment has been issued by the

Assessor S. T. Dissanayake but the Notice of Assessment dated 12.11.20158 bears the

seal of G. A. W. Abeywardena, who is an Assistant Commissioner. The learned

Counsel appearing for the Appellant argued that in terms of Section 163(3) read with

Section 164 of the Act, the same person who issues the Notice of Assessment should

make the assessment and communicate the reasons for not accepting the tax return. The

learned DSG appearing for the Respondent argued that the letter of intimation includes

the assessment and under Section 163(3) the Assessors task is to assess the person and

communicate the reasons for not accepting the tax return. Therefore, Assessor S. T.

Dissanayake has acted according to the law by signing the assessment sheet dated

30.09.20159 and issuing the letter of intimation dated 07.09.201510. The learned DSG

further argues that the Notice of Assessment issued under Section 164 is a computer-

generated document and a ministerial task. Therefore, the Notice of Assessment and

the letter of intimation need not be sent by the same person.

Refusing to accept the said argument of the Appellant, the TAC in its determination has

held that, when an Assistant Commissioner does not accept the tax return for a

particular year of assessment, under Section 163(3) of the Act, the Assistant

7 at page 86 of the appeal brief.

8 at page 87 of the appeal brief.

9 at page 242 of the appeal brief.

10 at page 86 of the appeal brief.

6

Commissioner will make an assessment and communicate the reasons for such non-

acceptance in writing and it is not mandatory for the Assistant Commissioner who made

the assessment to send the Notice of Assessment under Section 164.

In the case of Carbotels (Private) Limited vs. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue11 where this Court dealing with the same question of law, held that the

assessment is not bad in law merely for the reason that the Assessor who issued the

Notice of Assessment is not the same Assessor who made the assessment and

communicated the reasons for making such assessment. In this case, this Court

observed that,

In the instant case, communication of the reasons of the Assessor has taken place

albeit the notice of assessment is not issued by the same Assessor who made the

assessment and communicated his reasons for the same. However, when the

purpose of this practice is observed, it is clear that in the instant case, the Assessor,

one M.M.O. Wijesuriya, has done what was required of him by giving his mind to

the return and making a definite determination not to accept it. He has

communicated his reasons for arriving at his decision to the Appellant. No

prejudice could be said to have been caused to the Appellant.

In the case at hand, it is clear that Assessor S. T. Dissanayake had assessed and

communicated the reasons for such assessment in terms of Section 163(3) by placing

11 CA/TAX/11/2016, CA Minutes of 25.05.2022.

7

her signature on the assessment sheet dated 30.09.2015 and by issuing the letter of

intimation communicating the reasons for such assessment.

Considering the above-stated facts and circumstances this Court is of the opinion that

the Assessor who assesses and communicates the reasons for such assessment need not

be the same person who issues the Notice of Assessment and therefore, this Court

answer the first question of law in the negative and favour of the Respondent.

Question of Law II

Is the Assessment, (and the determination of the Commissioner General, and the

determination of the Tax Appeals Commission pursuant to same) liable to be

quashed and / or annulled inasmuch as the Assessor failed to duly provide reasons

for the Assessment as required by Section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No.

10 of 2006 (as amended)?

It is the argument of the learned Counsel for the Appellant that, instead of giving

reasons the Assistant Commissioner in the letter of intimation has given conclusions.

The learned Counsel for the Respondent contends that the reasons given by the

Assistant Commissioner are sufficient for the Appellant to prefer an appeal. The

Respondent relied on the case of Mrs E D Gunaratne vs. Jayawardena and others12

where it was held that a clue is given as to where the taxpayer had gone wrong in his

return and the reason given is adequate and intelligible to enable him to formulate his

grounds to appeal to the Commissioner.

12 Ceylon Tax Cases Vol 1 at page 246.

8

In the instant case the TAC in its determination has observed that, since the Appellant

has formulated the grounds of appeal, it indicates that the Appellant has understood

under what reasons the Assistant Commissioner has rejected the returns of income. In

this matter, we see that no prejudice has been caused as the Appellant had appealed to

the Respondent for the said decision of the Assistant Commissioner. If the Appellant

did not get proper reasons explaining the refusal of the income tax return by the

Assistant Commissioner, they would not be able to make a valid appeal.

In the letter of intimation, by quoting the Memorandum of Association and Auditors

Report, the Assistant Commissioner has clearly stated that the reason for not accepting

the tax return is that the Appellant is engaged in the business of investing shares of the

companies and such dividend and interest income should be treated as a part of trading

profit under Section 3(a) and not as a separate source of income.

Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that an adequate reason has been given by the

Assistant Commissioner in the letter of intimation enabling the Appellant to prefer an

appeal to the Commissioner. Thus, this Court answered the second question of law in

the negative in favour of the Respondent.

Question of Law III

Did the Assessor, the Commissioner-General, and the Tax Appeals Commission,

err in law in failing to recognize that the Appellant functioned as a Holding

Company as opposed to an Investment Company?

9

The position of the Commissioner General and the TAC is that the Appellant is an

investment company and therefore, the dividend and interest received by it forms

business income in terms of Section 3(a) of the Act. In deciding that the Appellant is

an Investment Company as opposed to a Holding Company, the Respondent relied on

the fact that the number of companies in which the Appellant has invested changes from

year to year and out of the companies it held shares, it had more than 50% shares only

in two companies.

The Appellant relied on the interpretation provided in Section 529 of the Companies

Act, No. 7 of 2007 and argued that the Appellant is a holding company.

holding company, a company shall be deemed to be another companys holding

company, if and only if that other company is its subsidiary. For the purpose of this

definition company includes anybody corporate;

subsidiary, a company shall be deemed to be a subsidiary of another, if and only if

(a) that other company either-

(i) controls the composition of its board of directors;

(ii) is in a position to exercise or control the exercise of more than half the

maximum number of votes that can be exercised at a meeting of the

company;

(iii) hold more than half of the issued shares of the company, other than shares

that carry no right to participate beyond a specified amount in a distribution

of profits or capital;

10

(iv) is entitled to receive more than half of every dividend paid on shares issued

by the company, other than shares that carry no right to participate beyond

a specified amount in a distribution of profits or capital; or

(b) the first-mentioned company is a subsidiary of any company which is that other

companys subsidiary.

Furthermore, the Appellant argues that in the nature of investment companies, the

shares are bought and sold within a short duration to make trading profits as opposed

to capital gains, whereas in the instant dispute, the Appellant only received dividends

and, capital gains at the time of disposal of the shareholding of each subordinate

company. The Appellant relied on the case of Janashakthi Securities Ltd vs.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue13 and argued that this Court has decided in

that case that the Appellant Company as an investment company on the basis that the

company was incorporated to carry on the business of investment and the company

invested in government securities such as treasury bonds and treasury bills on a

continuous basis. There were 240 transactions of that nature in the relevant year and the

income was derived from these trading transactions. I observe that the Appellant

company in the present case is not incorporated for such purpose but rather, to engage

in business in real estate and property development, management of an investment

portfolio and provision of management services. Further, the Appellant has not been

engaged in investing in the shares of the subordinate companies on a continuous basis

13 CA/Tax/10/2009, CA Minutes of 17.07.2013

11

but rather was holding the shares for long durations which resulted in receiving

dividend income over a period of time.

In the case of CEI Plastics Limited vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue14, the

criteria followed was that,

There had been repetitive shareholding transactions which had been carried on

systematically in an organized manner. These facts in my view establish that the

share trading activity referred to by the Appellant constituted a business within

the meaning of Section 3(a) of the Act.

This Court is of the opinion that there had not been such repetitive transactions on

investment in shares, hence that does not constitute a business in terms of Section

3(a) of the Act. Even though there has been a repetitive receipt of dividend income over

time, since such income is not generated by the principal business activity of the

Appellant, it should not be considered taxable income under Section 3(a). Furthermore,

this Court observes that the Appellant company has been controlling the subsidiary

companies through shareholding and the Appellant has held more than 50% of the

shares of the companies directly or indirectly as a group of companies.15 Therefore, it

is the view of this Court that the Appellant company is functioning as a holding

company rather than an investment company.

14 CA/Tax/03/2013, CA Minutes of 02.01.2019.

15 at page 205 of the appeal brief.

12

Based on the above circumstances, I am of the view that the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue and the TAC have erred in law in failing to recognize that the Appellant

company functions as a Holding Company as opposed to an Investment Company. I

answer the third question of law in the affirmative and in favour of the Appellant.

Question of Law IV

Were the interests earned by the Appellant in the first instance, liable to be

considered as income within Section 3(e) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of

2006, and not within Section 3(a) of the said Act?

Question of Law VI

Were the dividends earned by the Appellant in the first instance, liable to be

considered as income within Section 3(e) of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of

2006, and not within Section 3(a) of the said Act?

The Court will address the fourth and sixth questions of law together as follows.

The Respondent submitted that the dividend and interest income is the principal source

of income of the Appellant and therefore it should be treated as business income of the

company in terms of Section 3(a) of the Act. However, this Court observes that the

objective of incorporation of the Appellant company is to engage in business in real

estate and property development, management of an investment portfolio and provision

of management services, which does not include investment in shares and dividends as

a form of business activity.

13

Further, the position of the Respondent is that the dividend income from the subsidiaries

forms the major part of its income. The learned DSG appeared for the Respondent

submitted in her oral submissions that 82%-87% of the income of the Appellant

company derives from such dividend income and argued that if the dividend income is

exempted from tax, only a minute portion of the total income would be liable to

taxation. Therefore, such dividend income should be considered as business income in

terms of Section 3(a) of the Act. As reflected in the third question, the Appellant is a

holding company and not an investment company. Hence considering the main purpose

of incorporating the company, I am of the view that the dividend income does not

constitute profits or income from its business under Section 3(a).

Furthermore, this Court observes that the dividend income can be recognized as a

separate income from the primary income of the Appellant.16 Therefore, dividend

income should be recognized under Section 3(e) and not under Section 3(a) of the Act.

In Kanagasabhapathi vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue17, it was observed

that in tax cases, it is always necessary to remind oneself that when it is sought to

impose a tax on the subject, the burden is always on the revenue authorities to prove

that tax is exigible.. The CGIR has failed to demonstrate that the dividend and interest

earned by the Appellant company has derived from the source of profit and income

defined in Section 3(a) of the Act.

16 at page 13 of the appeal brief.

17 Sri Lanka Tax Cases, Vol. IV, p.140.

14

For the above reasons I am of the opinion that the Appellant is a holding company, and

the dividend and interest income earned by the Appellant in the first instance, is liable

to be considered as income within Section 3(e) of the Act and not within Section 3(a)

of the Act. I answer the fourth and sixth questions of law in the affirmative and in favour

of the Appellant.

Question of Law V

Did the Assessor, the Commissioner General, and the Tax Appeal Commission,

err in law in falling to give due credit in respect of withholding tax paid by the

Appellant in respect of interest received?

Question of law VII

Did the dividends earned by the Appellant not form part of its statutory income

in view of the provisions of Section 63 of the Inland Revenue Act No 10 of 2006?

The Court will address the fifth and seventh questions of law together as follows.

The position of the learned DSG appearing for the Respondent is that since the dividend

and interest income of the Appellant company should be treated under Section 3(a) of

the Act, the exemption in Section 63 is not applicable for the reason that it exempts the

dividend income under Section 3(e). The learned DSG argues that the explicit

exemption for the dividend income recognized under Section 3(a) is in terms of the

Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act, No. 9 of 2015, which is not recognized for the

accounting year of 2012/2013. The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that as

per Section 63 of the Act (amended), the exemption must be available to any dividend

15

income, and not only the dividend classified in Section 3(e) of the Act but also Section

3(a) and in any event, the dividend income falls under Section 3(e) of the Act as the

Appellant is a holding company. Section 63 of the Act reads as follows.

Where a dividend is paid by any resident company to any resident or non-resident

company, and either

(a) a deduction has been made under section 65 in respect of that dividend by

the first-mentioned resident company;

(b) that dividend is exempt from income tax under Section 10;

(c) such dividend consists of any part of the amount of a dividend received by

the first-mentioned resident company from another resident company; or

(d) such dividend is a dividend declared by a quoted public company,

profits and income from such dividend shall, notwithstanding anything to the

contrary in any other provision of this Act, be deemed not to form part of the

total statutory income of the second-mentioned company.

For the purpose of this section the profits and income from such dividends which

form part of the profits under section 3(a) of this Act, means profits and income

after deducting expenses in ascertaining the profits from such business of receiving

dividends.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the legislature intends to prevent

the same subject from being taxed at multiple stages of the same tax chain. When a

company generates profits, the tax is charged by way of corporate tax, and when

16

distributing the dividends, the subsidiary company pays withholding tax. The argument

of the learned Counsel for the Appellant is that charging tax from the Appellant on

dividends in this set-up where the subsidiary companies have already paid the tax

amount to double taxation.

The position of the learned DSG for the Respondent is that, as argued in Questions of

Law numbers III, IV and VII the dividend and interest income should be recognised

under Section 3(a), however, the exemption for dividend income was introduced to

Section 63 only after the Amendment Act, No. 9 of 2015. The learned Counsel

appearing for the Appellant argued that the explicit exclusion of Section 3(a) under

Section 63 is a mere clarification provided, all forms of dividend income has been

exempted from tax under the Act. Therefore, regardless of which subsection the income

has been recognized, it should be excluded. This Court observes that the literal

interpretation of the legislature has not excluded the dividend income under Section

3(a). In the case of John Keells Holdings PLC vs. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue18 which discussed a similar issue on exemption of dividend income under

Section 63, Samarakoon, J. held that,

It may be noted, that this amendment in 2015 is referred to not because it applies

to the years of assessment in question in this case, but because it shows the

intention of the legislature to apply section 63 even if the dividend income is

classified under section 3(1)(a).

18 TAX 26/2013, CA Minutes on 16.03.2022

17

Hence it appears that the amendments in 2014 and 2015 have a further purifying

effect on the principle embodied in section 63 of the Act.

Further, the Respondent argues that the dividend income of the company is

approximately 71% of its revenue and it would be impractical to exclude a major part

of income from tax liability. However, this Court is of the view that if the statute does

not provide for a tax liability, this Court cannot impose such beyond the letter of law.

In Partington vs. Attorney General19 Lord Cairns said,

"If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed

however great the hardship may appear to the Judicial mind to be. On the other

hand, if the Crown seeking to recover the tax cannot bring the subject within the

letter of the law the subject is free however apparently within the spirit of the law

the case might otherwise appear to be. In other words, if there be admissible in

any statute what is called an equitable consideration certainly such a construction

is not admissible in a taxing statute where you can simply adhere to the words of

the statute".

Hence as it was mentioned hereinbefore, there is no equity in a tax. Further, in W T

Ramsay vs. CIR20 Lord Wilberforce held that,

"A subject is only to be taxed upon clear words not upon "intendment" or upon the

"equity" of an act".

In the case of Ceylon Financial Investments vs. Commissioners of Income21 Howard CJ

held that,

for the enumeration of sources, we must turn to section 6 (1). Can it be said that

these sources like the Schedules in England are mutually exclusive? The wording

of sources (a), (b) and (c) shows that these sources are mutually exclusive. (d)

excludes (a), (b) and (c), and (h) excludes all previous sources. But there are no

words in (e) to show that this source does not apply to dividends, interest or

discounts arising from a trade or business. If the business of a company consists

in the receipt of dividends, interest or discounts alone or if such a business can

be clearly separated from the rest of the trade or business, then any special

provisions applicable to dividends, interest or discounts must be applied

Samarakoon J. in the John Keells Holdings PLC case(supra) analysed the case of

Ceylon Financial Investments vs. Commissioners of Income(supra) which the

Respondent heavily relied on in the present case in great detail and concluded that,

The majority of the 05 judge Bench classified the appellant in that case under

source (e) as well as source (a) and also decided that any special provision

applicable to dividends, etc., must apply.

Based on the above-mentioned circumstances, I am of the view that the CGIR has failed

to interpret Section 63 accurately and the dividends earned by the Appellant do not form

part of its statutory income in view of the provisions of Section 63 of the Inland

21 Ceylon Tax Cases, Vol I, page 235.

19

Revenue Act No 10 of 2006 and that income should be exempted. I answer the fifth and

seventh questions of law in the affirmative and in favour of the Appellant.

Question of law VIII

Is the Assessment, (and the Determination of the Commissioner General, and the

Determination of the Tax Appeals Commission, thereon) contrary to law?

Question of law IX

In view of the evidence and material before the Tax Appeals Commission, did the

Tax Appeals Commission err in law in arriving at the conclusions set out in its

determination?

Considering the above-stated opinion of this Court, I answer the eighth and ninth

questions of law in the affirmative and in favour of the Appellant.

For all the foregoing reasons, the Court answers the questions of law in the Stated Case

as follows,

1. No

2. No

3. Yes

4. Yes

5. Yes

6. Yes

7. Yes

20

8. Yes

9. Yes

Under the above-stated circumstances, the appeal in the form of a Case Stated is

allowed.
