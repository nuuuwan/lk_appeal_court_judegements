This is an appeal by the claimant-petitioner-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved by the order dated 28-01-2020 of

the learned Provincial High Court Judge of the Western Province Holden in

Colombo, where the revision application filed by him was dismissed without

notice being issued to the respondent.

The appellant is the owner of vehicle number 250-1359, which is a van. One

Mohammed Yoosuf Mohammed Iqbal has been charged before the Magistrates

Court of Mt. Lavinia for having transported a cow without a valid permit on 03-

08-2015, using the above vehicle for which the said person has pleaded guilty.

Upon recording his plea and convicting him, the learned Magistrate has

sentenced him and has also confiscated the cow that was transported without a

valid permit.

Thereafter, the learned Magistrate has allowed the registered owner of the above-

mentioned vehicle, namely the appellant, to show cause as to why the vehicle

should not be confiscated.

At the inquiry held in that regard, the appellant has given evidence. The learned

Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia of her order dated 19-11-2019, has ordered the

confiscation of the vehicle on the basis that the appellant failed to satisfy the

Court that he had no knowledge of the offence or that he took all necessary

precautions to prevent the offence being committed.

Against the above-mentioned order, the appellant has preferred the revision

application where the learned Provincial High Court Judge of Colombo has

pronounced the impugned order on 28-01-2020.

It appears from the proceedings before the High Court, that the learned Counsel

who represented the appellant, when supporting the application for notice, has

taken up the position that the charge framed against the accused of the vehicle

Page 5 of 13

in the Magistrates Court case was not in accordance with the law, hence, there

was no proper charge upon which the accused could have been convicted.

The learned Counsel appears to have maintained the position that since there

was no valid charge and valid conviction, there cannot be a procedure of calling

upon the registered owner to show cause, and therefore, the order of the learned

Magistrate should be set aside.

The learned High Court Judge has considered the said objection, and had

overruled the same. It has been determined that the appellant has failed to

explain two months delay in filing the said revision application, and had refused

to issue notice to the respondents in that regard.

It needs to be noted that this appeal was previously dismissed by this Court of

the order dated 08-11-2021, on the basis of the appellant being absent from the

Court for the hearing of the appeal.

However, after considering a re-listing application, this Court set aside the earlier

dismissal order, restored the appeal back to its previous status, and decided to

hear the appeal on its merits.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant made his

submissions on the basis that the dismissal of the revision application without

notice being issued was not in order, and made submissions to the effect that

the learned High Court Judge should have considered the merits of the

application based on facts, rather than relying on the technical objection to the

charge urged by the learned Counsel when supporting the application for notice.

He contended that this is a matter where the order of the learned Magistrate

should have been vacated and the reliefs asked for should have been granted.

The learned Senior State Counsel justified the dismissal of the revision

application, as well as the order of the learned Magistrate, and was of the view

that there was no material placed before the Court to interfere with both the

orders, and moved for the dismissal of the appeal.

Page 6 of 13

The accused in the relevant Magistrates Court case has been charged in terms

of the Animals Act, and had pleaded guilty to the charge preferred against him.

The learned Counsel who represented the appellant when the matter was

supported for notice before the Provincial High Court has taken up a position on

the basis that the charge against the accused in the Magistrates Court was

defective and the order of the learned Magistrate was therefore invalid. As

correctly determined by the learned High Court Judge, I find no basis to agree

with such a contention. It is abundantly clear from the charge preferred against

the accused in the Magistrates Court case that he has been well informed of the

fact that the charge against him was transporting one head of cattle in the

relevant vehicle without having a valid permit, and thereby committing an

offence in terms of the Animals Act.

It appears that the accused had legal representation when he was charged before

the Court. Although there may be a defect in the penal provision mentioned in

the charge, it is clear that when the accused pleaded guilty, he knew very well

what the offence against him was, as the offence was well described. Therefore,

I find no basis for the argument that the vehicle inquiry had been held based on

a wrong conviction. I find that the learned High Court Judge has well considered

the Judgements of our Superior Courts in that regard and overruled the said

position.

However, I am of the view that if the order that led to the confiscation of the

vehicle was considered in its correct perspective when the application for notice

in relation to the revision application filed before the Provincial High Court was

supported for notice, there was good and sufficient basis to issue notice on the

respondents and consider the application on its merits.

Page 7 of 13

Hence, I find that it is necessary for this Court to now consider the appeal before

this Court, having reference to the order of the learned Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia,

as the respondents named in the revision application is represented before this

Court.

It is clear from the order of the learned Magistrate that the learned Magistrate

has correctly considered the relevant provision of the Animals Act under which

an inquiry of this nature can be held.

The section 3A of the Animals Act as amended by the Amendment Act No. 20 of

1968 reads as follows.

3A. Where any person is convicted of an offence under this part or

any regulation made thereunder, any vehicle used in the commission

of such offence shall, in addition to any other punishment prescribed

for such offence, be liable, by order of the convicting Magistrate, to

confiscation.

Provided, however, that in any case where the owner of the vehicle is

a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made, if the owner

proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he has taken all

precautions to prevent the use of such vehicle, or that the vehicle

has been used without his knowledge for the commission of the

offence.

Interpreting the effect of the relevant section, it was held in the case of Faris Vs.

The Officer in Charge, Police Station Galenbindunuwewa and Another

(1992) 1 SLR 160:

In terms of the proviso of 3A of the Animals Act, an order for confiscation

cannot be made if the owner establishes one of two matters. They are,

1. That he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle

for the commission of the offence;

Page 8 of 13

2. That the vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence

without his knowledge.

In terms of the proviso, if the owner establishes any one of these matters

on a balance of probability, an order for confiscation should not be made.

An order for confiscation could be made only if the owner was present at

the time of the detection or there was some evidence suggesting that the

owner was privy to the offence. (See Nizar vs. Inspector of Police

Waththegama (1978-79) 2 SLR 204)

The section 3A itself shows that the obligation of an owner of a vehicle subject

to confiscation under this provision is significantly different when compared with

the relevant provisions of the Forest Ordinance as well as other statutes which

have similar provisions.

In terms of the proviso of the section 40 (1) of the Forest Ordinance as well as

the decisions of our Superior Courts in relation to the said provision, the

requirement in terms of the Forest Ordinance in an inquiry held in terms of the

proviso of section 40 (1) is to show that the owner had no knowledge of the

offence being committed and he took all precautions to prevent the offence being

committed.

The requirement in terms of the Animals Act is to establish either one of those

two requirements where the legislature by its wisdom has enacted the relevant

statute in such a manner.

Therefore, I am of the view that the only guidance that can be taken from the

Judgements pronounced by our Superior Courts in terms of the similar provision

in the Forest Ordinance would be the interpretation given to the words all

precautions to prevent the use and apply the same in considering the evidence

led in an inquiry in terms of the Animals Act. I am of the view that although the

words all precautions have been stated in the section, that need not mean that

an owner of a vehicle needs to prove all possible precautions, but the precautions

Page 9 of 13

that the owner is expected to take under the given facts and the circumstances.

I am of the view that this has to be considered on a case-by-case basis in relation

to the facts and the circumstances relevant to each case and not by applying a

strict yardstick in that regard.

When considering the evidence led at the inquiry before the learned Magistrate

of Mt. Lavinia, it was only the registered owner who has given evidence.

In his evidence he has stated that he purchased the vehicle in question having

utilized the money he earned by working overseas. According to him, he has paid

Rs. 500,000/- to purchase the vehicle and had obtained a finance facility of Rs.

1.5 million, where he had been paying an installment of Rs. 55,000/- per month.

He had stated that he used to park his vehicle in the Pettah Cross Street and

used the vehicle to transport goods from shops situated in the vicinity, and used

to earn about Rs. 70,000/- per month in the process.

He has claimed that on the date of the alleged offence, the vehicle was parked at

his aunts place in Dehiwala area and he came to know that the vehicle was

taken into custody for allegedly transporting a cow. He has admitted that the

driver of the vehicle who was charged before the Magistrates Court was his

father, but has stated that he was not privy to the offence committed by his

father and he has not engaged in any illegal activity. The appellant has claimed

the vehicle on that basis.

It is clear from his evidence-in-chief that, apart from stating the fact that he

never engaged in any illegal activities, he has not stated that he took all

reasonable precautions to prevent the offence being committed.

However, he has been specific that he had no knowledge of the offence. Under

cross-examination, he has explained that he too lives near the house where his

father is living with his family, and had stated that the father used to take the

vehicle with his permissions. He has claimed that on the date of the incident, he

only came to know only after the detention of the vehicle by the police that the

father has taken the vehicle, which was parked at his aunts place.

Page 10 of 13

He has denied the suggestion of the prosecution that it was he and his father

who used the vehicle to transport the cattle in connivance with each other. Upon

being questioned by the Court, he has stated that when he came to the place of

the detection upon hearing the incident, he saw that the cow was tied in the

garden of his parents home and it was that cow the police took into custody. He

has also stated that normally, the vehicle is used to transport goods belonging

to Pettah traders in the Pettah area to various shops and he used to earn a living

by engaging his vehicle for such hiring purposes.

In her order dated 19-11-2019, it appears that the learned Magistrate was well

aware as to the legal requirement of either establishing that the registered owner

had no knowledge of the offence being committed or he took all necessary

precautions to prevent it. She had also been very much mindful that the

necessary proof in that regard is on the balance of probability.

Having determined as such, the learned Magistrate has come to four main

conclusions after having considered the evidence placed before the Court

For matters of clarity, I will now reproduce the said main determinations.

Page 11 of 13

The above determinations clearly show that the attention of the learned

Magistrate had been to determine whether the registered owner had taken all

necessary precautions to prevent an offence being committed using his vehicle.

I am of the view that the learned Magistrate has come to these determinations

mostly on surmises and conjectures, rather than based on the evidence available

before the Magistrates Court.

The fact that the registered owner and the accused who is his father, lived close

by was not a disputed fact. The evidence of the appellant had been that the

vehicle was parked in his aunts house, and although his father used to take his

vehicle with his permission, on the day of the incident, it had been taken without

informing him. That had been the evidence of the appellant to show that he was

unaware of the offence being committed.

I find that, his evidence in that regard has not been materially challenged at the

inquiry. The reasoning given by the learned Magistrate to dismiss the evidence

of the appellant as to his source of income using the vehicle has been on the

basis of his failure to substantiate the manner he earns his living, and him not

calling evidence in that regard.

However, it needs to be noted that the appellant is a person who used his vehicle

to go on hires and supply goods to various places based on the hires he receives.

No one can expect a person of such caliber to maintain accurate records or to

call the persons who provided hires to him, other than giving oral evidence in

that regard. The evidence of the appellant had been to the effect that when he

came to the place of the incident after being informed of it, he saw a cow being

tied in the garden and at the time of taking over of the vehicle by the police, there

was no transportation. Comparing that evidence with the fact that the driver had

pleaded guilty to the charge, the learned Magistrate had concluded that the

appellant is a person who is uttering falsehood. However, I am not in a position

to justify such a conclusion.

Page 12 of 13

According to the evidence placed before the Court, the subject vehicle is a van

generally used by the appellant for hiring purposes and not by a driver employed

by him. His evidence has been that his father has taken the vehicle without his

permission. I am of the view that the evidence needs evaluation in that context,

and not in the manner a Court would look at the evidence in a case of

transporting timer without a permit or similar offences.

Even if it was the determination of the learned Magistrate that the appellant had

failed to take necessary precautions to prevent the offence being committed, I

find that if considered in the correct perspective, there was sufficient evidence

before the Court for the learned Magistrate to conclude that the appellant had

no knowledge of the offence being committed.

I am of the view that since the requirement is to establish either one of the two

scenarios mentioned in the section, the appellant had sufficiently established

that he had no knowledge of the offence. I am of the view that, the learned

Magistrate had failed to consider that aspect in the order, and if considered in

the correct perspective, there is no basis for the order of confiscation of the

vehicle

I am of the view that since the learned High Court Judge has not considered

whether the relevant legal principles had been adhered to by the learned

Magistrate when the impugned order of refusing to issue notice was made, both

these orders are orders that cannot be allowed to stand.

Accordingly, I set aside the order dated 19-01-2019 by the learned Magistrate of

Mt. Lavinia and also the order dated 28-01-2020 by the learned Provincial High

Court Judge of the Western Province Holden in Colombo.

I order that the vehicle number 250-1359 shall be released to the owner, namely,

the appellant Mohammed Iqbal Ahamed Mujahid.
