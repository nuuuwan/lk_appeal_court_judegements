Introduction

1) The Petitioners have made this application against the 1st

Respondent Cooperative Development Commissioner, Registrar of

Cooperative Development and against the other Respondents to set

aside the order of the Provincial High Court of Kegalle dated 18th

January 2018 and to grant the reliefs sought in the said High

Court Case number 4826 Writ.

2) The said reliefs sought in the Appellants appeal dated 14th March

2018 are as follows;

Facts of this case

3) On perusal of the petition, the relevant documents, and the written

submissions, it was found that the Appellants were the general

manager, accountant and sales manager of the 5th Respondent

Ruwanwella Cooperative Society.

4) During their tenure, with the assistance of the Board of Directors

of the said society, printing machines had been purchased for the

said society.

5) The said printing machines malfunctioned, leading to an inquiry

being held against the Petitioners.

6) The inquiry report had divulged that the said offset printers and

the paper cutting machines had defects at the time of purchase

resulting in a financial loss of Rs. 626, 165/for the society.

7) The society then appointed an Arbitrator to inquire into the said

loss.

8) The Petitioners were not satisfied by the decision made by the

Arbitrator and appealed against the said decision to the 2nd

Respondent.

9) The 1st Respondent also had confirmed the decision made by the

Arbitrator.

10) Aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioners had filed a Writ

application against the said decision to the Provincial High Court

of Kegalle and sought for a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

made by the 1st Respondent.

11) However, the learned High Court Judge had dismissed the petition

and refused the Writ of Certiorari application made by the

Appellants.

12) Aggrieved by the said decision, the Appellants have filed this

appeal to set aside the order made by the learned High Court

C.A. (PHC) 1900

Judge and issue a Writ of Certiorari, quashing the decision made

by the 1st Respondent.

Disputed facts

13) This is an appeal made against the order of the learned High

Court Judge of Kegalle dated 18th January 2018.

14) On perusal of the Order made by the learned High Court Judge of

Kegalle and the petition submitted by the Appellant to the High

Court, it is revealed that the application seeks to stay the

proceedings of the Magistrate of Ruvawella and to issue a Writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision made by the 1st Respondent.

15) Hence, the application made to the High Court of Kegalle is

confined to seeking rights under Writ jurisdiction. The following

points should be considered to arrive at my conclusion,

a. Had the learned High Court Judge considered the matters

related to the Appellants application to issue a Writ of

Certiorari?

b. If not, can the Appellant maintain this appeal?

I) Has the learned High Court Judge considered the matters related to the Appellants application to issue a Writ of Certiorari?

16) On perusal of the learned High Court Judges Judgement dated

18th January 2018, it is evident that the learned High Court Judge

had considered the facts pertinent to the application made by the

present Appellants, and noted the evidence led before the

Arbitrator and the decision made by the Arbitrator.

17) On the said grounds, the learned High Court Judge had

emphasized that the present Appellants had failed to prove any

C.A. (PHC) 1900

9

reason to set aside the Arbitrators decision before the 1st

Respondent.

18) The said facts had fortified the decision made by the Arbitrator and

the evidence led before the Arbitrator by both parties.

19) In making the determination, the High Court Judge specified that

to set aside the decision made by the 1st Respondent, the present

Appellants had to prove that excessive power was used, that there

was excessive jurisdiction and/or that the 1st Respondent made an

error and/ or violated the principles of natural justice.

20) Further, I will add to this point regarding the issuance of a Writ of

Certiorari, there is no unreasonableness proven by the Appellants.

21) In considering the 1st Respondents decision, it was based on the

conclusion reached by the Arbitrator who is the 4th Respondent.

22) On perusal of the brief, it is evident that lengthy evidence had been

led before the Arbitrator and the present Appellants had the

opportunity of cross examine the said witnesses.

23) The Arbitrator had decided the case based on the evidence led

before him.

24) It is noteworthy that the petition dated 10th October 2014, filed by

the Appellants to the Provincial High Court of Kegalle had sought

the following reliefs;

C.A. (PHC) 1900

10

25) In the said reliefs, the present Appellants had only sought to set

aside the Order made by the 1st Respondent and had not sought

any reliefs against the decision made by the Arbitrator.

26) Therefore, even if a Writ of Certiorari is granted to quash the 1st

Respondents decision, it will not affect the Respondents ability to

proceed with the Magistrate Courts application to recover the

money based on the Arbitrators decision.

27) Besides these facts, the learned High Court Judge reiterated that

there is no ground that excessive jurisdiction was used, that the

wrong principles were applied, or that principles of natural justice

were violated in making the aforementioned decisions.

28) In observing the decision made by the Arbitrator, the Arbitrator

has not violated any of the aforesaid grounds. The Appellants also

had failed to submit any documents or grounds before the learned

High Court Judge or this court, that demonstrated the 4th

Respondent had violated the aforesaid grounds referred to by the

learned High Court Judge.

29) To fortify the above position, I relate an additional fact that the

Appellants had failed to produce that in a Writ matter, to set aside

an Order made by an official, the party challenging the decision

made should show/prove that the said official had acted

unreasonably.

30) In the instant appeal or application made before the learned High

Court Judge the Appellants had failed to show that either the

Arbitrator or the 1st Respondent had acted unreasonably in their

decisions. In the said circumstances I do not see any reason to set

aside the order made by the learned High Court Judge dated 18th

January 2018.

II) If not, can the Appellant maintain this appeal?

31) In considering the aforesaid analysis, I draw my attention to the

decision made in the case of Geeganageh vs Director General

Customs1;

"By way of preface, I may say that the arguments put forward by the eminent President's Counsel for the petitioner might, perhaps, have been more acceptably addressed to a court exercising appellate and not supervisory jurisdiction - the latter jurisdiction being the one invoked by the petitioner in his petition seeking, under the judicial review procedure, a quashing of the aforesaid decision made by the 2nd respondent. The arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner are based solely on factual matters inviting the Court of Appeal more or less, to substitute its view in the interpretation of factual matters or situations dealt with in the Written submissions. The submissions seem to be oblivious of the distinction between appeal and review procedure. If one appeals against a decision, one is claiming that it is wrong, or incorrect. The Court of Appeal if it is persuaded of the merits of the case may allow the appeal and so it substitutes its view for that of the court or tribunal of first instance. Under the judicial review procedure the court is not concerned with the merits of the case, that is, whether the decision is right or wrong. In review (as opposed to appeal) the court only considers whether the decision is lawful or unlawful. 32) In the said Judgement it is decided that in a Writ matter the court

will not consider the merits of the case but the court will see

whether the decision made by the relevant officer is right or wrong.

33) Further, in the case of Meril vs. Dayananda de Silva2 and others

it was held;

As Certiorari and mandamus are public law remedies, it is important to know whether the relevant issue or decision under consideration in this matter involves public law the answer to the question on the issue is; on public law issue depends on either of the twp matters or on both viz 1) source

1 [2001] 3 SLR 273 at 182-3 2 [2001] 2 SLR 11 at 32

C.A. (PHC) 1900

12

of power of the authority making the decision; 2) the nature of the function that the authority exercises, or, sometimes, on both on the above considerations. and in Bisomanike vs. Cyril de Alwis3 it was held;

A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot be held to be a Writ of right, or one issued as a matter of course. But exercise of this discretion by Court is governed by certain well-accepted principles. The Court is bound to issue a Writ at the instance of a party aggrieved by the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases where he has disentitled himself to the discretionary relief by reason of his own conduct, like submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay, or waiver.

34) In the said Judgements it is very correctly pointed that the

discretion of court is used and the authority has exercised the

powers unreasonably and excessively.

35) And the said matter is confirmed by the Judgement of

Podimahathmaya vs. The Land Reform Commission4 which was

held;

This Court can interfere where there is a manifest

unreasonableness in an administrative act. The test is

whether the administrative authority has acted within the

rules of reason and justice.

36) The above cases have emphasized the test to be applied when

issuing a Writ of Certiorari. In most cases, the focus is on whether

the authorities have acted within the rules of reason and justice

and a Writ can be issued only when an authority has exercised

excessive jurisdiction, or in cases of error of law on the face of the

record, fraud, collusion, or unreasonableness.

37) In the instant appeal, the Appellants have failed to support any of

the aforesaid grounds. Therefore, I do not see any merit to grant

the reliefs claimed by the Appellants.

CONCLUSION

38) In view of the aforesaid facts, I dismiss the petition of appeal dated

14th March 2018 subject to tax cost payable to the Respondents.
