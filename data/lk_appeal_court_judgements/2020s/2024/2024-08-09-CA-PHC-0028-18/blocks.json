The arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner are based solely on factual matters inviting the Court of Appeal more or less, to substitute its view in the interpretation of factual matters or situations dealt with in the Written submissions.

In review (as opposed to appeal) the court only considers whether the decision is lawful or unlawful. 32) In the said Judgement it is decided that in a Writ matter the court",
