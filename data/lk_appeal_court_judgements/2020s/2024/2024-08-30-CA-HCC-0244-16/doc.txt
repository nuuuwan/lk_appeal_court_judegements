Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal by the 2nd accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved of his conviction and sentence by the

learned High Court Judge of Panadura.

The appellant along with the 1st accused was indicted before the High Court of

Panadura for committing the following offences.

1. That they caused the death of one Pullikutty Arachichige Punchinona

on 19-02-2002, at a place called Halthotiyawaththa in Horana within

the jurisdiction of the High Court of Panadura, and thereby committed

Page 3 of 13

the offence of murder, punishable in terms of section 296 read with

section 32 of the Penal Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, they committed the

offence of robbery of jewellery and other property valued at Rs. 62,000/-

belonging to one Lokupathirage Mallika Indrani, and thereby

committed an offence punishable in terms of section 380 of the Penal

Code.

3. Alternative to the 2nd count as above, the 1st accused at the same time

and at the same transaction had in his possession stolen property

mentioned in count 2, and thereby committed an offence punishable in

terms of section 394 of the Penal Code.

4. Alternative to the 2nd count as above, the 2nd accused, namely the

appellant, at the same time and at the same transaction had in his

possession stolen property mentioned in count 2, and thereby

committed an offence punishable in terms of section 394 of the Penal

Code.

After trial without a jury, the learned High Court Judge of Panadura of his

judgment dated 13-10-2016 found both the accused including the appellant who

was the 2nd accused guilty for the 1st and the 2nd count preferred against them,

and accordingly, they were acquitted of the 3rd and the 4th count preferred on

the basis that they were alternative counts to count 2.

The 1st accused indicted had absconded the Court throughout the trial, and the

trial has been proceeded against the 1st accused in terms of section 241 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

After the 1st accused was found guilty, the learned High Court Judge has

sentenced him for death on the 1st count and for a period of 10 years rigorous

imprisonment on count 2. He has also been fined Rs. 20,000/- with a default

sentence of 2 years simple imprisonment.

Page 4 of 13

Having considered the allocutus of the appellant, where he has said that he was

a 16-year-old schoolboy at the time of the commission of this offence, the learned

High Court Judge has imposed life imprisonment in lieu of death sentence in

relation to the 1st count. He has also been sentenced to a period of 10 years

rigorous imprisonment on count 2. In addition, he has been ordered to pay a fine

of Rs. 20,000/- with a default sentence of 2 years simple imprisonment.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal to be considered by the Court.

1. The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by failing to properly

evaluate the evidence against the 2nd accused and therefore, the

judgment was bad in law.

2. The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by applying the

Ellenborough Dictum in this case when the prosecution failed to

establish a prima facie case.

3. The learned High Court Judge misdirected himself by shifting the

burden of proof to the accused by expecting an explanation for certain

evidence which are not conclusive against the appellant and therefore

the judgment was bad in law.

Before considering the grounds of appeal and the argument presented by the

learned Counsel for the appellant and also by the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General (SDSG) in that regard, I find it appropriate to summarily narrate the

evidence led before the trial Court.

The Facts in Brief

This is a matter where the deceased, who was an old woman, was found killed

inside the house where she lived with her family members. At the time of the

incident, she has been alone at the house. Her death has been discovered only

after the inmates of the house returned home after days work,. It has been found

Page 5 of 13

that the house has been robbed, and several items of jewellery and some of the

valuables that were inside the house had been taken away. At the trial, PW-01

who was the wife of the deceaseds son, who lived in the house along with the

deceased has identified several items of jewellery and belongings that had been

robbed from the house.

It has to be noted that there are no eyewitnesses to this incident and this is a

matter that needs to be determined entirely based on circumstantial evidence.

The police officers who conducted the investigations had recorded the statements

of the 1st accused and the appellant after their arrest. As a result of the statement

made by the appellant, a purse, a pendant and a gold ring have been recovered

from a house. The relevant portion of the statement which led to the recovery

had been marked as P-14 at the trial in terms of section 27 of the Evidence

Ordinance.

The relevant portion of the statement made by the 1st accused which led to the

recovery of several other items had also been marked under the same provision.

The witness PW-01 has identified the ring and the pendant as items belonging

to her and her husband.

The other witness of importance when it comes to the circumstantial evidence

against the appellant had been PW-03 Sumudu Priyangika Perera. She has been

a neighbour of the 1st accused. She has known him as well as his mother well.

On 19-02-2002, namely on the date of the incident, around 8.00 8.30 in the

morning, the 1st accused has visited her house and had stated that he has some

jewellery belonging to his mother and although she needs to pawn them she

cannot do so as she is not in possession of an identity card, and has requested

her to help him out to get the jewellery pawned.

According to her evidence, the appellant has accompanied the 1st accused when

he visited the house. He was unknown to her, and had met him only on that

occasion. Agreeing to the request of the 1st accused, she has accompanied him

Page 6 of 13

and the appellant to Bandaragama Rural Bank and has pawned two gold chains

given by the 1st accused to her and had obtained Rs. 13,000/-, which she has

then given to the 1st accused. She has also gone to the Piliyandala Dedigama

Pawning Centre along with them and pawned another gold chain given by the 1st

accused at that centre and had obtained Rs. 10,000/-, which she has again given

to the 1st accused. On their way back, the 1st accused has purchased a ring and

some clothes from Piliyandala town and has told PW-03 to hand over them to his

mother, which she has done on her return. On the same day, she has come to

know that a grandmother has been killed. Fearful that the gold jewellery pawned

by her may have been taken from the person who was killed, she has destroyed

the pawning receipts she had with her. She has been arrested by the police on

22-02-2002. She has identified the ring purchased by the 1st accused when

giving evidence in Court. PW-03 has spent some time in remand custody as a

suspect of this crime, but had been released later and made a witness.

When the learned High Court Judge called upon the appellant for his defence at

the conclusion of the prosecution case, he has made a statement from the dock.

He has denied any connection to the offence and had stated that he was a 16-

year-old schoolboy when he was arrested. He had stated that the 1st accused

was his mothers elder sisters son, and the mothers elder sister and the 1st

accused visited their home, and while they were there, the 1st accused was

arrested by the police. He has claimed that subsequently he was also taken to

the police station and made to sign documents. He has claimed that PW-03 was

unknown to him, and he saw her for the 1st time when he was arrested and taken

to the police station.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

Since the grounds of appeal urged are interrelated, I will now proceed to consider

the said grounds of appeal together. Since this is a matter that should be

considered entirely based on circumstantial evidence, I find it appropriate to

Page 7 of 13

discuss the basic ingredients that should be proved in a case where

circumstantial evidence needs to be considered.

In the case of The King Vs. Abeywickrama 44 NLR 254 it was held:

Per Soertsz, J.,

In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence, the jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and

inconsistent with any reasonable hypotheses of his innocence.

In the case of Don Sunny Vs. The Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 01, it was

held:

1) When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards only inference that the accused committed the

offence. On consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can

be arrived at should be consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2) If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence, if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say that the charges have been proved beyond

reasonable doubt.

3) If upon consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence the

only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed the

offence, then they can be found guilty. The prosecution must prove that

no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of committing the

offence. The accused can be found guilty only if the proved items of

circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent

with their innocence.

However, when considering the circumstantial evidence, what has to be

considered is the totality of the circumstantial evidence before coming to a firm

Page 8 of 13

finding as to the guilt of an accused, although each piece of circumstantial

evidence when taken separately, may only be suspicious in nature.

In the case of King Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 145, it was held:

In a case of circumstantial evidence, the facts given in evidence may, taken

cumulatively, be sufficient to rebut the presumption of innocence, although

each fact, when taken separately, may be a circumstance only of suspicion.

The jury is entitled to draw inferences unfavourable to an accused where he

is not called to establish an innocent explanation of evidence given by the

prosecution, which, without such explanation, tells for his guilt.

In the case of Regina Vs. Exall (176 English Reports, Nisi Prius at page 853),

Pollock, C.B. considering the aspect of circumstantial evidence remarked;

It has been said that circumstantial evidence is to be considered as a chain,

and each piece of evidence as a link in a chain, but that is not so, for then,

if any one link broke, the chain would fall. It is more like of a rope composed

of several codes. One strand of the rope might be insufficient to sustain the

weight, but stranded together may be quite of sufficient strength.

It was observed in the case of Karunaratne Vs. Attorney-General (2005) 2 SLR

233,

Per Jagath Balapatabendi, J.,

The primary advantage of circumstantial evidence is that the risk of perjury

is minimized since it, unlike direct evidence, does not emanate from the

testimony of a single witness. It is therefore more difficult to fabricate

circumstantial evidence, than it is to resort to falsehood in the course of

giving direct evidence.

There is no principle of the law of evidence which precludes a conviction in

a criminal case based entirely on circumstantial evidence. There are no

Page 9 of 13

uniform rules for the purpose of determining the probative value of

circumstantial evidence. This depends on the facts of each case.

In the case of Krishantha de Silva Vs. The Attorney General (2003) 1 SLR

162:

Per Edirisuriya, J.,

It is admitted that this is a case of circumstantial evidence. In such a case,

circumstances relied upon should be consistent with the guilt of the accused

and inconsistent with his innocence. If the circumstantial evidence relied

upon can be accounted for on the supposition of innocence then the

circumstantial evidence fails. Circumstantial evidence can be acted upon

only if, from the circumstances relied upon the only reasonable inference to

be drawn is the inference of guilt. If the circumstances are consistent both

with guilt and with innocence then the case is not proved on circumstantial

evidence. The hypothesis of innocence must be excluded by the

circumstances relied upon and the circumstances must point to one

conclusion alone, i.e. the guilt of the accused. The learned trial Judge has in

detail, discussed these principles to be followed in appreciating

circumstantial evidence in the instant case.

There are two main pieces of circumstantial evidence that have been led against

the appellant. The 1st one being the evidence of PW-03 who says that the

appellant accompanied the 1st accused when he came and met her and wanted

her to pawn some jewellery for him.

The 2nd piece of circumstantial evidence is the discovery of items that were in the

house where the deceased was killed, as a result of the statement made by the

appellant to police in terms of section 27 of the Evidence Ordinance.

It is settled law that evidence in a case has to be considered in its totality, be it

the evidence of prosecution witnesses or that of the defence, without

compartmentalizing it. It is also well settled law that if a a fact discovered as a

Page 10 of 13

result of evidence can be interpreted in favour of the prosecution case or the

same fact can be considered in favour of the defence, in such a scenario, the

version which favours the defence has to be considered.

In the case of Alim Vs. Wijesinghe (S.I. Police, Batticaloa) 38 CLW 95, it was

held that,

Where the same facts are capable of an inference in favour of the accused

and also an inference against him, the inference consistent with the

accuseds innocence should be preferred.

When the evidence of PW-03 is considered having in mind the above legal

principles, what has to be determined is whether her evidence was cogent

enough to accept as it is. I am of the view that in that regard, the dock statement

made by the appellant and the stand taken up by him at the trial should also be

considered along with the evidence of PW-03. Although a dock statement made

by an accused person has less value compared to evidence given under oath, it

is settled law of this country that even a dock statement has some evidential

value which needs to be considered.

The evidence of PW-03 had been to the effect that the appellant was unknown to

her and she saw him for the 1st time when he accompanied the 1st accused to

her house. If that was the case, the best evidence to establish that it was the

appellant who came along with the 1st accused would have been to hold an

identification parade in that regard, which has not happened as part of the

investigation of this case.

The stand taken up by the appellant in his dock statement had been that he did

not go with the 1st accused to meet PW-03 and he has never seen her until she

was arrested and produced before the police station.

It is an undisputed fact that the PW-03 was also under remand custody as a

suspect in this matter. She has later been released and made a witness for the

prosecution. According to her evidence, she was the one who took the jewellery

Page 11 of 13

and pawned them and obtained money, which, according to her, has been given

to the 1st accused.

Under the circumstances, since the identification of the appellant by PW-03

amounts to a dock identification, it needs to be considered whether such an

identification can be considered as a safe identification of the appellant. It may

be quite possible for PW-03 to conclude that the person in the dock is the one

who came with the 1st accused even though it is also possible that the PW-03

has identified the appellant correctly. I am of the view that under the

circumstances, and in view of the defence taken up by the appellant, this

uncertainty as to the identity of the appellant needs to be considered in favour

of him.

The other piece of evidence against the appellant is the discovery of a purse, a

gold ring and a pendant as a result of his alleged statement to the police.

It is settled law that the value that can be attached to a recovery made based on

a section 27 statement is to impart the knowledge of the fact discovered to the

person who made the statement.

The Indian Supreme Court held in the case of Kottaya Vs. Emperor 1947 AIR

PC at Page 70;

In Their Lordships' view it is fallacious to treat the' fact discovered' within

the section as equivalent to the object produced; the fact discovered

embraces the place from which the object is produced and the knowledge of

the accused as to this, and the information given must relate distinctly to

this fact. Information as to past user, or the past history, of the object

produced is not related to its discovery in the setting in which it is

discovered. Information supplied by a person in custody that 'I will produce

a knife concealed in the roof of my house' does not lead to the discovery of

a knife; knives were discovered many years ago. It leads to the discovery of

the fact that a knife is concealed in the house of the informant to his

knowledge, and if the knife is proved to have been used in the commission

Page 12 of 13

of the offence, the fact discovered is very relevant. But if to the statement

the words be added 'with which I stabbed A these words are inadmissible

since they do not relate to the discovery of the knife in the house of the

informant.

The evidence led at the trial shows that the things discovered as a result of the

section 27 statement made by the appellant were things taken from the house of

the deceased, which shows that the appellant had the knowledge as to where he

kept the things found. However, there must be evidence to show which connects

the appellant to the crime in order to make use of the section 27 statement

against him.

It is undisputed that the appellant as well as the 1st accused are close relatives.

The evidence led at the trial shows that the 1st accused had been arrested while

he was at the house of the appellant. The appellant, in his dock statement has

explained the presence of the 1st accused in his house saying that he visited their

house along with his mother and was arrested while they were in their house.

This cannot be considered as an unusual event since they were close relatives.

When considering this fact in relation to the evidence of PW-03, which says that

it was the 1st accused who brought her the jewellery and did the entire

transaction with her, I am of the view that the discovery cannot be concluded as

a fact that connects the appellant directly to the killing of the deceased.

I find that the attention of the learned High Court Judge has not been drawn to

the above legal matters that should have been considered in favour of the

appellant when the learned High Court Judge analyzed the evidence against him.

I am also of the view that the learned High Court Judge has failed to analyze the

defence taken by the appellant in its correct perspective.

Under the circumstances, I am of the view that although there are suspicious

circumstances which may connect the appellant to the crime, those suspicious

circumstances taken as a whole, are not sufficient enough to conclude that the

Page 13 of 13

charges against the appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. I am

of the view that it is not safe to convict the appellant on such evidence.

Therefore, it is my considered view that the conviction of the appellant based on

the circumstantial evidence available against him cannot be allowed to stand

and the grounds of appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the appellant has

merit.

Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the sentence of the appellant by the

learned High Court Judge of Panadura and acquit him from the 1st and the 2nd

counts for which he was found guilty.
