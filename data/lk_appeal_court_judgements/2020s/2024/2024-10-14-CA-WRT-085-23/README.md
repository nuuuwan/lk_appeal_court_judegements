The facts of this case are briefly as follows:

According to the petition, the late Weerasekara Mudiyanselage Gedara Bandara Abeykoon,

the Petitioners father is the original grantee of the land situated in Nallapambukulama

village in Anuradhapura District under and in terms of Section 19 (4) of the Land

Development Ordinance No.19 of 1935 as amended (hereinafter referred to as the

Ordinance). The Petitioner states that, his father had nominated the 7th Respondent namely

Weerasekara Mudiyanselage Gedara Manjula Bandara Abeykoon, the 8th Respondent

namely Weerasekara Mudiyanselage Gedara Rohini Inoka Abeykoon, and the 9th Respondent

namely Weerasekara Mudiyanselage Gedara Sanjeewani Amalka Abeykoon as the

successors and allocated respectively 2/4th, 1/4th and 1/4th shares to them.

The Petitioner states that the Petitioners father passed away on or around 17.07.2010

survived by his children being the Petitioner and the 7th to 9th Respondents. The Petitioner

further states that his mother Pannilage Dona Violet passed away before his father on

12.08.2007.

As stated by the Petitioner, the 8th and 9th Respondents had built two houses on the impugned

land while the original grantee was alive. The Petitioner avers that, after the demise of the

Petitioners father, among the three successors, only the 8th and 9th Respondents continued

to be in the said land and the 7th Respondent never came to the possession or did any

development on it.

The Petitioner further states that, on or about 22.02.2021, the Petitioner requested the 5th

Respondent, the former Divisional Secretary of Mihintale to grant him the title to the

unoccupied 2/4th share of the land that was nominated to the 7th Respondent by the original

Page 7 of 13

grantee. Thereafter, the 5th Respondent requested detailed reports from No. 572-Henawatte,

Grama Niladhari and the Land Officer of the Divisional Secretarys Office of Mihintale. The

Petitioner states that, the 5th Respondent after being satisfied with the said reports, granted

the Petitioner the title to the 2/4th share on or about 22.03.2021 under and in terms of Sections

68(2) and 72 of the Ordinance.

According to the Petitioner, the 7th Respondent after being aware that the title to the 2/4th

share of land has been granted to the Petitioner, sent a letter dated 20.04.2021 to the 5th

Respondent requesting to cancel the title granted to the Petitioner. Thereafter, the 5th

Respondent by letter dated 21.04.2021 requested the Petitioner and the 7th Respondent to be

present at the Divisional Secretarys Office on 28.04.2021 which was held with the presence

of the 5th Respondent, the Land Officer, the 572-Henawatte Divisional Grama Niladhari, the

Petitioner and the 7th Respondent. The Petitioner states that, after the inquiry, the 5th

Respondent decided to permit the Petitioner to stay on the land as the 7th Respondent had

failed to come into the possession of the land in question within the stipulated time period

which is six months after the death of the original grantee according to Section 68(2) of the

Ordinance.

The Petitioner further states that, the 2nd Respondent and the 3rd Respondent by their letters

dated 06.10.2021 and 25.10.2021 addressed to the 5th Respondent stating inter alia that, the

granting of the title under and in terms of the Third Schedule of the Land Development

Ordinance is unlawful when the original grantee had made a valid nomination and have

requested the 5th Respondent to act according to the Circular No. 2015/8 issued by the 1st

Respondent and to take necessary steps to cancel the same and to grant the title to the

nominated successor.

Page 8 of 13

According to the Petitioner, the 1st Respondent had sent a letter dated 29.08.2022 marked as

P22 to the 6th Respondent requesting inter alia to immediately cancel the title granted to the

Petitioner and grant the same to the nominated successor as advised by the 4th Respondent

by his letter dated 24.06.2022 marked as P21. Thereafter, the 6th Respondent cancelled the

title granted to the Petitioner and granted the same to the 7th Respondent on 30.09.2022

which is marked P24.

The Petitioner thereafter filed a caveat on 28.09.2022 at the Land Registry of Anuradhapura

to protect his interest in the land in question. The Petitioner had come to know that, on

27.10.2022 his title to the impugned land was cancelled and granted to the 7th Respondent

through a notice dated 04.10.2023.

The Petitioners main contention is that, the 1st Respondents decision marked as P21 to

award the title to the 7th Respondent is illegal and ultra vires.

The Petitioner has thus invoked the jurisdiction of this Court seeking for writs of Certiorari

to quash the decisions of the 2nd and 3rd, 4th,1st and the 5th Respondents contained respectively

in the letters marked as P19, P20, P21, P22 and P23 and to quash the documents marked as

P24 and P25.

On the other hand, the 7th Respondent has taken the following preliminary objections.

1. The original order made by the 5th Respondent granting the title to the Petitioner is

bad in law.

2. Section 72 of the Land Development Ordinance does not apply when there is a

nominated successor alive.

According to the Petitioner, the 7th Respondent has failed to enter into the possession of the

land within six months from the date of the death of the permit holder. We are mindful that,

Page 9 of 13

the spouse of the permit holder passed away before the permit holder on 12.08.2007. The

particular original permit holder nominated the 7th, 8th, and 9th Respondents as successors to

the said land. According to the Petitioner and the Respondents, the 8th and 9th Respondents

have taken possession of the land and put up houses. If the story of the Petitioner is to be

believed that the 7th Respondent did not enter into the possession of the land within six

months as per Section 68(2) of the Ordinance, the 5th Respondent should have considered

Section 74 of the Ordinance which reads as follows, instead of Section 72 of the said

Ordinance.

74. Where two or more persons have been duly nominated as successors of a holding,

the title of any one of such successors who is dead on the date on which such successor

is entitled to succeed, or who refuses so to succeed, or who fails so to succeed within a

period of six months reckoned from such date, shall, as from such date, be deemed to

have accrued to the other successors who were duly nominated with him.

If it is to be presumed that the 7th Respondent failed to succeed, the said portion of land

should have been given to the 8th and 9th Respondents who are the other successors along

with the 7th Respondent. Knowing that all the successors are alive, the 5th Respondent had

acted according to Section 72 of the Ordinance.

Further, we observe that there was no inquiry held by the 5th Respondent before he acted

under Section 72 of the Ordinance. When we peruse the document marked P21, the 1st

Respondent had considered the documents submitted by the 7th Respondent to prove that he

had entered into possession within six months time, therefore, he acted under Section 84 of

the Ordinance allowing the 7th Respondent to occupy the land.

For convenience of reference, an excerpt of the document marked P21 is reproduced below.

The succession of lands was considered by His Lordship Aluwihare J in W.M. Chandra

Kumari Palamakumbura v. P.A. Hema Damayanthie and Others, SC Appeal No. 47/2012,

Decided on 09.03.2016, (2016 BLR 171 at page 173),

In the context of this case the issue that has to be decided is as to whether the

Respondent has succeeded to the land in suit, after the demise of her parents.

Of the applicable provisions, sections 55 and 68 of the Ordinance are crucial to decide

the issue of this case.

At the hearing, it was contended on behalf of the Appellant that, in terms of Section

55 of the Land Development Ordinance, the mere nomination of a successor by itself

cannot be construed as disposition of the land for which the successor is nominated.

Section 55 of the ordinance clearly states:-

The act or transaction whereby a successor is lawfully nominated under the

provisions of this Chapter shall not be construed as a disposition of the land for which

such successor is nominated. (emphasis added).

The ordinance defines the term Disposition in Section 2 and reads thus:-

Disposition with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means any

transaction of whatever nature affecting land or the title thereto, and includes any

conveyance, devise, donation, exchange, lease, mortgage or transfer of land;

Thus, it appears that the mere nomination of a successor does not tantamount to

automatic transfer of the land to the successor nominated; the nominee is then

required to have the permit officially transferred upon making an application to that

effect to the relevant authority. In view of the statutory provision embodied in section

Page 12 of 13

55 of the Land Development Ordinance, only upon regularising the permit, can the

successor gain full benefit of the enjoyment of the land.

Section 84 of the ordinance clarifies this position.

Section 84 (b) states that, if the permit-holder is not survived by his or her spouse or

if the spouse does not succeed to the land, any other person who is a duly nominated

successor of the deceased permit-holder shall be entitled to succeed to that land on

such person obtaining a permit from the Government Agent under the provisions of

this Ordinance to occupy that land.

In the instant case, according to the document marked P21, there is evidence to show that,

the 7th Respondent had made applications to the Respondents with regard to the land in suit.

Accordingly, the 7th Respondent has fulfilled the requirements under Section 68(2) of the

Ordinance, thus the 7th Respondent has come into the possession of the said land within six

months time.

We are of the view that, once the nominated successor has fulfilled the requirements to be

eligible to be a successor, there is no reason for the 5th Respondent to consider Section 72 of

the Ordinance.

Under Section 84 of the Ordinance, it gives the 7th Respondent who is a nominated successor

qualified under Section 68(2) of the Ordinance, entitlement to the succession of the said land

to obtain a permit from the Government Agent to occupy the land.

We are of the opinion, that the 1st Respondent had acted according to law when he arrived at

the decision that the decision taken by the 5th Respondent, the former Divisional Secretary

was wrong.

Page 13 of 13

Therefore, we hold that, the 1st Respondents direction to the 6th Respondent to cancel the

title granted to the Petitioner and register the name of the 7th Respondent as the lawful

successor to the 2/4th share of the impugned land is lawful.

For the afore-mentioned reasons, we dismiss the application with costs.
