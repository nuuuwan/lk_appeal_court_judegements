Introduction

The Applicant, T.G. Perera, the landlord of the property at No. 98, Janapriya

Mawatha, Panadura, submitted an application under Section 18A of the Rent

Act1 to the 3rd Respondent, the Housing Commissioner of the Western Province,

seeking permission to demolish the building for redevelopment. It is an

undisputed fact that late T.G. Perera was the landlord while the Appellants were

the tenants.

While the inquiry was ongoing, T.G. Perera passed away, and letters of

administration for his estate were granted to the 1st and 2nd Respondents. As a

result, the 1st and 2nd Respondents were substituted in place of late T.G. Perera.

The Respondents-Petitioner-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellants) filed statement of objections to the application made by the

landlord, the initial applicant.

Following the inquiry, the 3rd Respondent made an order on 25th April 2014,

allowing the application of the 1st and 2nd Respondents, subject to the payment

of Rs. 374,400/- as compensation to the Appellants.

The aggrieved Appellants sought a mandate in the nature of writ of certiorari

from the Provincial High Court of Colombo to quash the order issued by the 3rd

Respondent.

The learned High Court Judge of Colombo dismissed the Appellants application

by his judgment dated 5th October 2016. This appeal is filed against the judgment

of the learned High Court Judge.

Analysis

Undoubtedly, the primary objective of the Rent Act is to protect the rights and

interests of tenants. Enacted in 1972, the Rent Act underwent a significant

amendment in 19802, when the Legislature introduced Section 18A. This

1 No. 7 of 1972, as amended. 2 Rent (Amendment) Act No. 55 of 1980.

5

CA/PHC/0117/2016

provision allowed landlords to apply to the Housing Commissioner for

permission to demolish rented residential premises that were 50 years or older,

if redevelopment was necessary for more efficient use of the land. In 2002, the

Legislature further amended the Act, reducing the minimum age of the building

to 40 years and extending scope of the application of Section 18A to business

premises as well3. In my view, the introduction of Section 18A was intended to

relax the protection afforded to tenants under the Rent Act, enabling landlords to

utilize their rented properties in a more efficient and effective manner.

For clarity, I will reproduce Section 18A of the Rent Act, which reads as follows:

18A. The Commissioner of National Housing may

(a) Upon application made in that behalf by the owner of any building

used for residential or business purposes and constructed at least

forty years prior to the date of the application;

(b) After affording the occupants of such building an opportunity of

being heard, make order authorizing such owner to demolish such

building if the Commissioner is satisfied that the re-development

of the land on which such building stands is necessary for the more

efficient utilization of such land.

Accordingly, in an application under Section 18A of the Rent Act, the following

facts must be established:

i. That the building in question was at least 40 years old at the time of the application. ii. That the redevelopment of the land on which the building is situated is

necessary for more efficient utilization of the land.

In the case of Aboobucker v. Wijesinghe and others4, (C.A.) His Lordship

Wijeyaratne J., in considering an application for a writ of certiorari against the

decision of the Commissioner of National Housing, examined Section 18A of

the Rent Act. His Lordship observed that, When the Legislature enacted Section

3 Rent (Amendment) Act No 26 of 2002. 4 [1990]2 Sri L.R. at page 278.

6

CA/PHC/0117/2016

18A in the terms if the Commissioner is satisfied the evident intention of the

Legislature was to make the Commissioner the sole Judge of whether conditions

existed to warrant demolition.

In the recent judgment of this Court in Kithsiri Pradeep Witharana v. P. Leka

Geethanjalee Perera and others5, the Court of Appeal observed as follows:

The Act has not specified any condition other than the age of the building. The

Commissioner has to consider whether the commercial building that has been

constructed more than 40 years ago to suit the socio-economic environment

prevailed during that time is good enough to serve the present-day requirements.

The land area does not expand with the expansion of the population and their

requirements. Therefore, the only solution to fulfil the need of the society is to

utilize the land more effectively. Whether this can be done by just a

renovation/modification or whether the building needs a structural change is

matter to be decided by the Commissioner. Whether the building is in a

dilapidated condition or not is not material. What is material is that whether the

re-development of the land on which such building stands is necessary for the

more efficient utilization of such land.

Whether the building sought to be demolished is more than 40 years old?

The application of Section 18A is not limited to the buildings those are

dilapidated and require immediate demolition and reconstruction. The key

consideration in granting or rejecting an application is not the condition of the

building, but its age and the necessity for redevelopment to ensure more efficient

utilization of the land.

The primary argument put forth by the learned President's Counsel for the

Appellants was that the Respondents failed to prove that the building was more

than 40 years old at the time the application was made. He argued that, under the

Rent Act, strict proof of this fact is required. To support this argument, he

highlighted that the reduction of the building's age requirement from 50 years to

40 years reflects the Legislature's intention to demand strict proof of this fact. I

5 CA/PHC/123/2012, decided on 02.03.2017.

7

CA/PHC/0117/2016

do concede that, in an application under Section 18A of the Rent Act, proof that

the building is over 40 years old is indeed necessary.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant argued that the test to be

applied regarding the age of the building is 'objective' rather than 'subjective,' in

contrast to the second requirement, which concerns whether the redevelopment

of the land on which the building stands is necessary for more efficient utilization

of the land.

The Blacks law Dictionary defines the word objective as of, relating to, or

based on externally verifiable phenomena, as opposed to an individuals

perceptions, feelings or intentions.6

The word subjective is defined as based on an individuals perceptions,

feelings, or intentions as opposed to externally verifiable phenomena.7

As correctly submitted by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellants, the

burden of proof is indeed on the Respondents (Applicant) to establish that the

building was over 40 years old. In the present case, the application was made on

3rd August 20068. Therefore, the Respondents bear the burden of proving that the

building existed at least in the year 1966. However, the determination of whether

the building is over 40 years old must be made by the Housing Commissioner

based on the available evidence. Thus, the Housing Commissioner must be

satisfied not only that the redevelopment of the land on which the building stands

is necessary for more efficient utilization of the land, but also that the building

is indeed over 40 years old.

The Respondents submitted notices of assessment and extracts from the

assessment register to support their claim that the building was over 40 years old.

According to the assessment register extracts, the property was described in 1966

as a tiled residence and land with an annual value of Rs. 400/-. This same

description and value persisted until 1973. In 1974, the property description

changed to a concrete roofed shop and land with the annual value increasing

to Rs. 2,000/-. The same entry appeared in 1975 as well. Following this, a special

6 B. A. Garner and H. C. Black, Black's Law Dictionary, 11th Edition, at p. 1291. 7 Ibid at p.1723. 8 Vide pages 419 to 421 of the appeal brief.

8

CA/PHC/0117/2016

note was added to the register indicating that, due to a fire at the Urban Council

Office, records prior to 1987 were unavailable. In 1989, the description of the

property changed again to an asbestos roofed shop and the land and the annual

value increased to Rs. 5,400/-. These entries continued until 1998, and in 1999,

the description was updated to a concrete and asbestos roofed two storied retail

shop. with the annual value further increased to Rs. 37,440/-.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant argued that it is clear that

around 1966, there was a residential building with a tiled roof and the rest of the

land. In 1974, it was converted into a shop with a concrete roof. He contended

that a new building was constructed in 1974. Furthermore, an asbestos-roofed

shop was built on or before 1989. Then, around 1999, a two-story retail shop

with a combination of concrete and asbestos roofing was constructed, covering

the entire land. Therefore, he argued that the building the Respondents seek to

demolish is a new structure from 1999, not the one that existed in 1966. He

pointed out that the changes to the building are reflected in the increase in its

annual value. However, it is well known that Urban Councils periodically raise

the annual value of properties within their jurisdiction.9

The learned Presidents Counsel argued that the Housing Commissioner applied

a purely subjective test in determining the age of the building to be demolished,

relying primarily on her own observations during her inspection10. However, I

note that the Housing Commissioner did not solely rely on her own observations

to reach the conclusion that the building is over 40 years old. She has explicitly

stated that, in addition to her observations, she considered other sources of

evidence, including the deeds, assessment registers, and oral testimony from

witnesses. Based on this comprehensive review, she was satisfied that the

building was indeed over 40 years old. Furthermore, the Housing Commissioner

also obtained a report from the Authorised Officer11, who, based on his own

inspection, opined that the building was over 50 years old.

CA/PHC/0117/2016

In the case of Ferdinands v. De Silva and another12 (C.A.), His Lordship T.G.D.

De Alwis J. held that the observations of the Commissioner regarding the

building are indeed relevant.

The Appellants claimed that they were not given an opportunity to be heard

during the Housing Commissioner's inspection of the building. However, this

Court observes that the Housing Commissioner had informed the Appellants to

be present at the site, but the Appellants have failed to take advantage of the

opportunity provided13. Therefore, the Appellants cannot now argue that the

Housing Commissioner violated the principles of natural justice, specifically the

rule of audi alteram partem.

The learned Presidents Counsel also submitted that the Housing Commissioner

failed to set out the specific factors she claims to have observed during her

inspection of the premises. However, I observe that the Commissioner did, in her

report, provide detailed observations, including that the walls are constructed

using Kabok bricks and plastered with lime. Additionally, she noted that the

outside front door is a very old steel door, and the rafters and reapers of the

asbestos roof are decayed. Therefore, the Appellant's submission in this regard

is without merit.

The above observations raise a significant issue regarding the nature of the roof.

According to the entry in the assessment register from 1999 onwards, the roof is

described as being made of both concrete and asbestos. However, the Housing

Commissioner, after inspection has not mention that any part of the roof is

concrete, which casts serious doubt on the accuracy of those entries.

The learned High Court Judge in his impugned order noted that it is evident that

the real picture or the changes of the premises is not shown by the assessment

register14

Consequently, the learned High Court Judge concluded that although some

renovations were carried out, the foundation of the building remained

unchanged. After considering all the available evidence, I am of the view that the

12 4 Sri SKLR 66. 13 Vide pages 315 and 316 of the appeal brief. 14 At page 53 of the appeal brief.

10

CA/PHC/0117/2016

changes were limited to certain alterations and renovations. Consequently, I

uphold the findings of the learned High Court Judge.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant argued that the learned High

Court Judge erred in stating that the real picture or the changes to the premises

were not reflected in the Assessment Register. According to the assessment

registers, there have been changes to the original structure in 1974, 1989, and

1999. The learned Presidents Counsel contended that these changes, particularly

the alterations to the roof, serve as evidence that a new building was constructed.

He further argued that the increase in the annual value supports this claim,

suggesting that these were not mere renovations, as stated by the 3rd Respondent,

Housing Commissioner.

However, I observe that no material had been produced before the Housing

Commissioner indicating that a new building had been constructed. Had this

been the case, the Urban Council would have been required to approve a new

building plan. Furthermore, there was no oral evidence presented to the Housing

Commissioner by the Appellant that a new building had been erected. Therefore,

the only reasonable conclusion the Housing Commissioner could have reached

was that the alterations were simply renovations, as she concluded.

In light of the above analysis, I am satisfied that the Housing Commissioner's

determination that the building is over 40 years old is valid. Therefore, the

decision of the learned High Court Judge is also legally sound.

Whether re-development of the land is necessary for the more efficient

utilization of the land.

The second requirement for a successful application under Section 18A is that

the Housing Commissioner must be satisfied that the redevelopment of the land

on which the building stands is necessary for more efficient utilization of the

land.

The determination of this fact depends on the circumstances of each case. In

reaching a conclusion on this matter, the Housing Commissioner has a duty to

consider all relevant circumstances as they exist at the time of the hearing. Some

factors may carry little or no weight, while others may be decisive. However, the

11

CA/PHC/0117/2016

Housing Commissioner should not disregard any relevant facts and must

consider all of them, giving each the appropriate weight and adopting a common-

sense approach. It is in this context that the Housing Commissioner's own

investigation becomes crucial.

The Housing Commissioner can only be satisfied on this matter by considering

all the surrounding circumstances, such as the condition of the building, its

location, the potential for more efficient and profitable use of the land after

redevelopment, the financial means of the landlord, and other relevant factors. It

is not enough for the landlord to simply state an intention to build a new

structure; the landlord must establish the genuineness of this intention. It is the

responsibility of the Applicant (Respondent) to provide sufficient evidence to the

satisfaction of the Housing Commissioner in this regard. Without such evidence,

the Housing Commissioner cannot be properly satisfied.

In order to establish the bona fides and the reality of the application, the applicant

should provide supporting evidence, such as the building plan, approval of the

plan by the local authority, estimates for the new construction, and proof that the

applicant has the financial means to carry out the redevelopment. Only by

providing such evidence the Housing Commissioner can be satisfied of the

genuineness and feasibility of the application.

However, in the case of Kithsiri Pradeep Witharana15, the Court of Appeal

expressed the following view:

The Act does not provide that the financial capacity of the landlord as a material

fact in an inquiry under section 18A of the Rent Act. Instead, the law provides

that if the landlord fails to re-develop the building within the specified period or

periods, he is running at the risk of acquiring the land by the state. Therefore, it

is for the landlord to obtain necessary financial assistance and it is not for the

1st Respondent to satisfy that he has financial capacity to redevelop.

Nevertheless, in my view, this Court has not entirely dismissed the relevance of

the applicant's financial capacity. It was merely stated that it is not a material fact

in itself. In an application under Section 18A of the Rent Act, the Housing

15 Supra note 5.

12

CA/PHC/0117/2016

Commissioner must determine whether the demolition is necessary for more

efficient utilization of the land. To make this determination, consideration of

factors such as the number of floors and units in the proposed building, and the

available facilities. The applicant's financial capacity to complete the

construction are important to assess the genuineness of the applicant's intention.

In the instant case, the Respondents have submitted both oral evidence and

documents to demonstrate that they have sufficient means to carry out the

construction16.

The Appellants stated in their written submissions that the Respondents

(Applicants) failed to provide convincing evidence regarding the proposed

redevelopment and its necessity. It was argued that the Respondents did not

submit an approved plan for the proposed redevelopment, which is a crucial

piece of evidence required for the 3rd Respondent, the Housing Commissioner,

to make a rational and informed decision.

Admittedly, the Urban Council of Panadura approved a building plan on 3rd June

200517. The Appellant's contention is that by the time the Order was made by the

Housing Commissioner, the validity of the approved plan had expired. Although

a fresh plan was submitted for approval, it was not approved by the relevant date.

In response, the Respondents explained that due to the prolonged inquiry before

the Housing Commissioner, the validity of the original plan expired, and the 1st

and 2nd Respondents were compelled to resubmit the same plan for approval.

It is a fact that the original application under Section 18A of the Rent Act was

made to the Housing Commissioner on 3rd August 2006, and the impugned

decision of the Housing Commissioner was made on 25th of April 2014, more

than seven years later. According to the Housing Commissioner's Order, there

were thirty-one inquiry dates, spanning from October 2016, to November 2013.

The Appellants contended in their written submissions that at the time the

application under Section 18A was submitted, there was no approved plan for

the proposed redevelopment18. However, this assertion is factually incorrect, as

16 Vide pages 340, 359, 360 and 363 of the appeal brief. 17 At page 459 of the appeal brief. 18 At paragraph 23 of the Written submissions filed by the Appellant.

13

CA/PHC/0117/2016

the plan had already been approved on 3rd June 2005, well before the application

was submitted on 3rd August 2006.

The Appellants highlighted evidence of a witness from the Urban Council of

Panadura, indicating that the building permit was not extended during the period

from 2005 to 201219. However, it is important to note that the building plan was

approved in 2005, and the application under Section 18A was made in 2006.

Therefore, when the application was submitted, there was indeed an approved

plan in place20. The validity of that plan, however, expired in 2010 after five

years, while the application was still pending.

Another key consideration regarding the genuineness of the application is

whether it is an attempt to evict the tenant under the guise of an application under

Section 18A of the Rent Act. In this case, the original applicant also initiated

proceedings in the District Court of Panadura to evict the tenants from the

premises21, but that case was dismissed on 7th February 2013. The application

under Section 18A, however, was made on 3rd August 2006, meaning it was not

filed in response to the dismissal of the District Court action.

The exact date of the filing of the District Court case is unclear from the available

material, but according to the judgment, the original applicant claimed damages

from the tenants starting from 1st August 2008. This suggests that the District

Court case was likely filed in 2008. Therefore, it cannot be said that the original

applicant used Section 18A as a means to evict the tenant after failing in the

District Court case. It is important to recognize that a landlord has the right to

pursue different remedies available under the Rent Act simultaneously.

In my view, the potential economic benefit to the landlord could also be a

relevant consideration for the Housing Commissioner. The statutory rent paid by

the Appellants is only Rs. 634.6422, which, in my opinion, is a relatively small

19 At paragraph 22 of the Written submissions filed by the Appellant. 20 Vide evidence at page 273 of the appeal brief. 21 Vide the judgement at page 215 of the appeal brief. 22 Vide page 420 of the appeal brief.

14

CA/PHC/0117/2016

amount for any property rented in an urban area like Panadura. The Appellant

has been the tenant of this premises at least since the year 197523.

With regard to business premises, another important consideration could be the

potential public benefit.

The Appellants raised the issue that the building they occupy cannot be

demolished for reconstruction without demolishing the entire row of shops. They

argued that the Respondents have not provided evidence of permission to

demolish at least two adjoining shops. However, aside from the Appellants' own

statement, there was no expert opinion presented regarding these facts.

Therefore, I am of the view that the Housing Commissioner did not err in her

conclusion on this matter.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant argued that the learned High

Court Judge erred in stating, that if the Housing Commissioner is satisfied that

the premises is 40 years old, the Order is within her powers. As I have already

discussed, the determination of whether the building is over 40 years old must

be made by the Housing Commissioner. However, this decision should not rely

solely on her own observations. As I have already stated, the Housing

Commissioner based her conclusion on a combination of oral testimony, deeds

submitted, the assessment registers from the Panadura Urban Council, and her

own observations. Therefore, I am of the view that the learned High Court Judge

did not err in concluding that, if the Housing Commissioner is satisfied that the

building is over 40 years old, the decision falls within her authority.

In the aforementioned case of Aboobucker v. Wijesinghe and others24, His

Lordship Wijeyaratne J., having considered the jurisdiction of the Court of

Appeal to review an administration action, observed that Courts no doubt have

jealously guarded its right to review administrative action, but it has now been

well establish that courts will not interfere with the exercise of such

administrative authority unless they are satisfied that the administrative tribunal

23 Vide page 390 of the appeal brief. 24 Supra note 4.

15

CA/PHC/0117/2016

has acted mala fide or on no evidence or un reasonably or has fail to follow

the principles of natural justice or has gone wrong in law. (emphasis added)

In the case of Anura Abeysinghe alias Abayasinghe v Galle Co-operative

Hospital Limited25 (C.A.) His Lordship Mahinda Samayawardhena, J. (as His

Lordship then was) stated that, There is a misconception that even if an

administrative or judicial decision is patently erroneous, writ of certiorari does

not lie, if the decision-making process was flawless, and the deciding authority

has erred on facts and not on law.

It is important to understand that an error of fact can also be an error of law.

Accordingly, I find myself unable to agree with the learned High Court Judge's

conclusion that the purpose of a Writ of certiorari is not to, consider whether

the decision is correct or not but to consider whether decision given is within the

power.

The question of whether there was insufficient evidence to support the Housing

Commissioner's conclusion is also relevant.

The learned High Court Judge, in the impugned order, observed that it was

evident the 3rd Respondent, the Housing Commissioner, had issued the order

under Section 18A of the Rent Act while adhering to the correct procedure. The

learned High Court Judge further noted that all relevant factors had been duly

considered and that the Housing Commissioner acted within her lawful authority,

without exceeding her jurisdiction. The evidence considered by the Housing

Commissioner, as analysed in this judgment, clearly provided sufficient grounds

for her to arrive at the conclusion that she did.

Conclusion

In view of the reasoning set forth in this judgment regarding the matter at issue,

I find no grounds to justify interfering with the order of the learned High Court

Judge dated 5th October 2016, whereby the writ of certiorari seeking to quash

the Housing Commissioners decision was dismissed.
