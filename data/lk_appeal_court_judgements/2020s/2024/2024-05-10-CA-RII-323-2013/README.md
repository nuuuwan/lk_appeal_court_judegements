D. N. Samarakoon J.,

This application for Restitutio in Integrum and or Revision stems from a partition

action that was instituted somewhere in time1 prior to 31.07.1962 when the

preliminary plan No. 2495 was prepared.

Even this RII application was instituted on 14.10.2013.

It came to me on 10.02.2021.

The original case record, which was called from the District Court of Kegalle

came to this Court on 06.05.2022.

Senior counsel for the 41(A) defendant petitioner, Mr. Parakrama Agalawatte had

informed the Chief Justice by 17.11.2022, that he will no longer be practicing

due to ill health.

There were final dates fixed for argument.

Even during the last few days of the year 2023, prior to the period known as the

court vacation, on 11.12.2023 when I sat with Justice Iddawala the learned

counsel for the 46 A defendant respondent was held up in the Supreme Court.

But some of the dates given prior to that were obtained by the counsel who

succeeded Mr. Agalawatte.

The stance of the 41st A petitioner is that,

(i) The lands in question are contiguous lands of Tennapitahena,

Nagodayahena and Dingirigewatte of 5 Amunams paddy sowing

(ii) It appears, that, as per the preliminary plan No. 3394 dated 31.07.1962

it was 41A.1R.29P., in extent (page 327)

(iii) There was an agreement between the parties that the corpus is Lots 01

to 09 and 11 to 13

(iv) Judgment is dated 25.11.1983 (page 173)
