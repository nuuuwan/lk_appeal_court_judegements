Facts of this case

3) The Petitioner-Petitioner [hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner]

is the owner of the land situated at No. 28/11, Suriyamal

Mawatha, Divulapitiya, Boralesgamuwa as described in the

schedule to the petition.

4) The 4th to 8th Respondents are also the residents of Suriyamal

Mawatha, Boralesgamuwa. The dispute had arisen between the

Petitioner and the 4th to 8th Respondents regarding the discharge of

wastewater into the culvert/drain which had been constructed to

facilitate the flow of rain water through the Petitioners property.

5) The 1st to 3rd Respondents are respectively the Secretary to the

Urban Council Boralesgamuwa, Public Health Inspector and the

Boralesgamuwa Urban Council who are responsible for Urban

Governance.

6) The Petitioner contended that the discharge of wastewater is an

illegal act by the 4th to 8th Respondents and it pollutes the

environment, creates health hazards to the public and causes

severe environmental damage.

7) The said matter was reported by the Petitioner to the 1st

Respondent and informed the Chairman of the 3rd Respondent.

8) On that, a Technical Officer from the 3rd Respondent Council had

inspected and warned the 4th to 8th Respondents not to discharge

the wastewater into the said public drain.

9) Despite the said warnings the 4th to 8th Respondents had

continued to discharge the wastewater into the drain which is

constructed to discharge rain water.

10) The Petitioner had continued to complain to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Respondents to prevent the illegal act of the 4th to 8th Respondents.

However the public duty cast upon the 1st to 3rd Respondents had

failed to prevent the ongoing discharge of wastewater.

11) On the aforesaid grounds, the Petitioner had filed a Writ

application before the High Court of Colombo to prevent the

ongoing discharge of wastewater citing the inability of the 1st, 2nd

and 3rd Respondents as public officers, to take necessary action to

stop the said illegal activity.

12) Nevertheless, the Honourable High Court Judge of Colombo had

declined to issue notice to the Respondents and had dismissed the

Writ of Mandamus application. Thus, aggrieved by the said Order

the Petitioner has preferred this application.

Disputed facts

13) When this appeal was taken up for argument on 5th September

2024, all the parties agreed to conclude their arguments by filing

written submissions.

14) Upon considering the written submissions, and relevant

documents, to arrive at the conclusion, I have to evaluate the

following disputes, to determine whether the Learned High Court

Judge of Colombo had erred in dismissing the Petitioners

application for reliefs under Writ Jurisdiction.

i) What is the legal Principal of Writ of Mandamus?

ii) Can the Petitioner maintain a Writ of Mandamus

application being a private party?

iii) If not, can the Order made by the High Court Judge be

vacated?

C.A. (PHC) 0102-18

I. What is the legal Principal of the Writ of Mandamus?

15) Mandamus is a discretionary remedy used to compel the Public

Bodies to perform their duties when they fail to do so in an official

capacity.

16) The literal interpretation discussed by H.W.R. Wade and C.F

Forsyth in their book of Administrative Law1 to Mandamus is as

follows;

The prerogative remedy of a Mandatory Order

has long provided the normal means of enforcing

the performance of public duties by public

authorities of all kinds. Like the other prerogative

remedies, it is normally granted on the

application of a private litigant, though it may

equally well be used by one public authority

against another.

Like quashing and prohibiting Orders, a

Mandatory Order is a discretionary remedy

17) Further, on perusal of the Principles of Administrative Law in

Sri Lanka2 by Dr. Sunil Cooray the Mandamus Writ Jurisdiction

is specified as follows;

Mandamus strongly retains its original character

as a public law remedy, and it is a remedy in

respect of a duty of a public nature only. It does

not lie, for example, to enforce performance of an

agreement for the supply of a telephone service

1 Wade, H.W.R. and Forsyth, C.F. (2014) Administrative Law, 11th ed. Pg 520 2 Coorey, S.F.A. (2020) Principles of Administrative Law in Sri Lanka, 4th ed., vol. 2. Pg 994

C.A. (PHC) 0102-18

where the duty to supply the service is founded

purely on contract.

18) Based on the aforesaid literature, it is abundantly clear that the

Mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty. In this

context, the Applicant must demonstrate a legal interest that falls

within the public domain, rather than one of a merely private

character.

ii. Can the Petitioner maintain a Writ of Mandamus

application being a private party?

19) When perusing the petition, written submissions and the Learned

High Court Judges Order, the application put forward by the

Petitioner seeking a Mandamus Writ against the 1st, 2nd and 3rd

Respondents must be examined to determine whether there exists

a public duty for the said Respondents to perform.

20) At the outset, I draw my attention to paragraph 1 and 2 of the

Learned High Court Judges Order and as well as the petition of

appeal dated 25th May 2018. The Learned High Court Judge had

correctly identified that the issue between the Petitioner and the

4th to 8th Respondents is of a private nature, as the Petitioners

grievance concerns the discharge of wastewater by the 4th to 8th

Respondents into the drain constructed for rainwater runoff.

21) The Petitioner had written to the 3rd Respondent regarding this

issue. At no point did the Petitioner assert that the drain falls

under the purview of, or is maintained by the 3rd Respondent.

22) Thus, it is evident that, a drain belonging to private land cannot be

maintained by the 3rd Respondent.

C.A. (PHC) 0102-18

23) Further, the Petitioner had reiterated that the illegal discharge of

wastewater pollutes the environment and creates health hazards to

the public. However, there is no documentation/evidence to

support the allegations made by the Petitioner.

24) In the said circumstances, it is abundantly clear that this is a

private dispute between the Petitioner and the 4th to 8th

Respondents. Therefore, the Petitioner has to seek remedies in a

different forum.

25) It must be borne in mind that the 3rd Respondent is the local body

while the 1st and 2nd Respondents are the government employees of

the said local body.

26) As decided in Weligama Multi Purpose Co-operative Society

Ltd. V. Chandradasa Daluwatta3 ;

Mandamus lies to secure the performance of a

public duty, in the performance of which an

applicant has sufficient legal interest. To be

enforceable by mandamus the duty to be

performed must be of a public nature and not of a

merely private character

27) The narrow interpretation of the aforesaid decision is that

Mandamus lies solely to secure the performance of a public duty.

28) Further, the case of S.R.F Perera V Urban Council Wattala4 also

had explained the grounds on which a Writ of Mandamus can be

obtained.

29) Therefore, as I have said before, it is manifest that to obtain a Writ

of Mandamus, the enforceable duty must be of a public nature.

C.A. (PHC) 0102-18

30) In the instant matter the Learned High Court Judge had correctly

decided to refuse the Mandamus, as there is no duty cast upon the

1st to 3rd Respondents against the 4th to 8th Respondents.

iii. If not, can the Order made by the High Court Judge be

vacated?

31) As I have explained in the preceding paragraphs, the Petitioner had

failed to demonstrate that there is a public duty to be performed by

the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents. Further to that, the Petitioner

does not disclose the statutory provision under which the 1st, 2nd

and 3rd Respondents should be compelled to enforce their duties.

32) Failure of the Petitioner to refer to any statute itself is sufficient to

reject his application of Writ of Mandamus as decided in the case

of Dr. AC. Visvalingam and another V. The Hon. Attorney

General and Lalith Weeratunga 5;

Mandamus will lie to any person who is under a duty imposed by statute to do a particular act. It commands the person to whom the said writ is addressed to perform some legal duty which he has refused to perform.

33) Even though the High Court had dismissed the Petitioners Writ of

Mandamus application, the Petitioner had still pursued to set aside

the High Court Judges Order without any merit knowing that the

application does not fall within the scope of Writ of Mandamus.

34) I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge had considered

all the relevant facts and the documents in his Order dated 27th

March 2018. Therefore, there is no necessity to interfere with the

said Order made by the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo. 5 CA Application No. 668/2006

CONCLUSION

35) For the reasons set out above, I dismiss the petition of appeal

dated 25th May 2018 subject to payment of Rs. 100 000/- cost to

the 1st , 2nd and 3rd Respondents and Rs. 50 000/- each cost

payable to the 4th to 8th Respondents.
