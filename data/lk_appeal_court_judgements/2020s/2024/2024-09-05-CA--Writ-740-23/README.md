RESPONDENTS

3

Respondent to supply electricity to the land or part thereof forming the subject

matter of this application based on a request made by the 5th Respondent.

(c) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition preventing the

5th Respondent or any other unauthorized person other than the Petitioner from

requesting for the supply of electricity to the land or part thereof forming the

subject matter of this application belonging to the Petitioner.

(d) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition preventing the

1st to 4th Respondents or any one or more of them from supplying electricity to

the land or part thereof forming the subject matter of this application belonging

to the Petitioner.

(e) Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st

to 4th Respondents or any one or more of them to disconnect the electricity

supply given to the said land or part thereof belonging to the Petitioner.

(f) Grant and issue an interim order restraining and/or preventing the 1st to 4th

Respondents or any one or more of them from supplying electricity to the said

land forming the subject matter of this application without the consent of the

Petitioner who is the owner of the land until the final determination of

this application.

Nevertheless, when the matter was taken up for argument on 29.07.2024 the learned

Presidents Counsel appeared for the Petitioner informed the Court that the Petitioner

is pursuing only the reliefs sought in the prayers (b) and (e), precisely, issue a Writ of

4

Certiorari to quash the decision contained in the letter dated 03.11.2023 marked as P20

sent by the Chief Electrical Engineer of the Ceylon Electricity Board (the 4th

Respondent) to the Petitioner informing that the Ceylon Electricity Board (the 1st

Respondent) is taking steps to supply a temporary electricity connection on the request

made by the 5th Respondent to the subject land of this Application which the Petitioner

is claiming that he is the owner and occupier and a Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st

to 4th Respondents to disconnect the electricity supply given to that land. Even though

the notices of this Application with the annexures were served on the 5th Respondent

he has neither appeared before the Court nor a representation made on his behalf and

therefore the matter proceeded ex-parte against him. No statement of objections has

been filed by the 1st to 4th Respondents resisting the Application of the Petitioner and

at the Argument, the learned DSG appeared for them informed to Court that they do

not object to the Court being granted reliefs seeking by the Petitioner.

The position of the Petitioner is that the subject land of this Application is an ancestral

property of his family which is now owned and possessed by him and the 5th

Respondent is neither a member of the family nor has any legal right to the land but

claims it on a fraudulent deed. The Petitioner has instituted an action bearing No.

474/Land in the District Court of Minuwangoda against the 5th Respondent for

vindication of his title to the subject land and ejectment of the 5th Respondent thereupon.

Furthermore, an enjoining order has been obtained by the Petitioner against the 5th

Respondent and that action has not yet been concluded. The Petitioner, on or about

5

10.02.2023 became aware that the 5th Respondent was attempting to obtain electricity

to the land and he promptly by the letters dated 10.02.2023 and 09.10.2023 (marked as

P17 and P18 respectively) informed the 4th Respondent about the afore-stated facts and

requested him not to approve any request from any person to obtain electricity

connection to the subject land, and further that if the electricity connection is given,

irreparable loss and damage could be caused to him. However, disregarding the facts

stated in P17 and P18, by the letter dated 03.11.2023 marked as P20 which the Petitioner

seeks to quash by a Writ of Certiorari, the 4th Respondent informed the Petitioner that

a decision has been made to provide electricity to the land temporary on the request of

the 5th Respondent. Admittedly, the electricity has already been supplied to the land.

The Petitioner argues that under the above-stated circumstances, the decision

mentioned in P20 and the supply of electricity to the land is illegal, unreasonable,

arbitrary and ultra vires to the provisions laid down in the Sri Lanka Electricity Act,

No. 20 of 2009 (the Act).

It is the position of the Petitioner that the 1st Respondent is vested with powers to supply

electricity only on a request of the owner/occupier of a property and in the instant

Application since the owner of the property is the Petitioner, the 1st to 4th Respondents

has acted unreasonable, arbitrary and ultra vires to the provisions in Sub-section (1) of

Section 25 of the Act. Sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Act provides that a

distribution licensee shall on any request by the owner or occupier of any premises

within the Authorized Area of the licensee- (a) connect, supply and maintain the supply

6

of electricity to those premises; and (b) so far as may be necessary for that purpose,

provide electric lines or electrical plant or both, subject to the provisions of this Part

(Part II), any regulations made under this Part or under section 54, and the Electricity

Supply Code (as set out in Schedule II to this Act). Janak de Silva, J. in H.K. Kumara

Vs. The Ceylon Electricity Board and Others1, observed that the Electricity Board is

under a statutory duty to provide an electricity connection to the owner or occupier of

any premises within its authorised area provided all the legal requirements are

satisfied. Further, in the case of Ajantha Kumara Vs. Ceylon Electricity Board and

Others2, his Lordship has again held that,

Section 25(1) of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No. 20 of 2009 states that a

distribution licensee shall on any request by the owner or occupier of any

premises within the Authorized Area of the licensee connect, supply and

maintain the supply of electricity to those premises and connect, supply and

maintain the supply of electricity to those premises. The word "occupier" in an

act pari materia, namely section 33(1) of the Electricity Act, No. 19 of 1950,

was interpreted by Vythialingam J. in Municipal Council of Badulla v.

Ratnayake3 to mean a lawful occupier and not, for instance, a mere squatter.

In the instant action as soon as the Petitioner came to know that the 4th Respondent has

decided to provide electricity to the land in dispute the Petitioner has raised his

1 CA (Writ) 100/2017, CA Minutes on 07.06.2019.

2 2019 1 SLR 42.

3 (1978-79) 2 Sri LR 141.

7

objections by P17 and P18. Despite that objection, the 4th Respondent decided to

provide electricity connection and supply to the land in dispute and informed that

decision to the Petitioner by P20. When considering the above-stated facts, it is evident

that by the time the decision mentioned in P20 was made, the 4th Respondent was aware

that there is a dispute over the ownership and/or occupancy of the land for which the

electricity supply had been requested. When there is a dispute regarding the ownership/

occupation, the procedure to be followed by the 1st Respondent has been laid down in

Section 39 of the Act.

As provided by Sub-section (1) of Section 39 of the Act in the event of a dispute relating

to the connection and supply of electricity to a premises, it shall be referred to the Public

Utilities Commission (the Commission) if the parties have not been able to resolve

the dispute through any dispute resolution procedure prescribed by the Commission.

Section 39(1) of the Act reads as follows.

(1) The following disputes arising in connection with the supply or use of

electricity shall be referred to the Commission by any party to the dispute:

(a) a dispute between a licensee and a tariff customer arising under

Sections 25 to 30 or Schedules I, II or III to this Act;

(b) any dispute (other than a dispute referred to in paragraph (a))

between a licensee and -

(i) a tariff customer;

(ii) another licensee, or

(iii) any other affected party,

8

which the parties have not been able to resolve through any dispute

resolution procedure prescribed by the Commission, despite the licensee

using its best efforts to do so.

(2) On a reference under paragraph (a) of subsection (1), the Commission

shall mediate and resolve the dispute and on a reference under paragraph

(b) of subsection (1), the Commission shall mediate and resolve the dispute,

unless it decides that it is more appropriate for the dispute to be determined

either by the courts or through arbitration.

(3) The practice and procedure to be followed in the resolution of any such

dispute shall be such as the Commission shall set out by rules made under

the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Act, No. 35 of 2002 and this

Act.

Rules made by the Commission under Section 53 of the Act read with sub-sections (1)

and (3) of Section 39 under the Extraordinary Gazette No. 1951/1 dated 25.01.2016 sets

out the dispute resolution procedure for disputes arising between a licensee and any

other affected party in Rule 3 and 4 as follows:

(3) A tariff customer or any other affected party who has a dispute specified

under Rule 2(l)(a), (b) or (c) with a licensee and wishes to resolve such

dispute may, for that purpose, send to the Deputy General Manager of the

respective Distribution, Transmission or Generation licensee of Ceylon

Electricity Board (CEB), or Head of Operations of Lanka Electricity

9

Company (Private) Limited (LECO) (hereinafter referred to as the Dispute

Resolution Officer) a written request substantially in Form A set out in the

Schedule to these Rules, setting out the matter in dispute and any other facts

that such tariff customer or any other affected party considers to be relevant

there to, including a proposal for the resolution of the same.

(4) Within ten (10) working days of the date of receipt of the request referred to

in Rule 3, the Dispute Resolution Officer shall arrange a meeting between

the two disputant parties, Viz.

(i) the tariff customer or other affected party; and

(ii) the officer responsible for the matter in dispute, (hereinafter referred to as the

Relevant Officer),

and upon so meeting, both parties shall use their best efforts to resolve the

dispute by reaching at a mutually acceptable settlement, with the help of the

Dispute Resolution Officer.

In the instant action, since the 4th Respondent was aware at the time which the decision

mentioned in P20 was made that there is a dispute over the ownership and the

occupation of the land between the Petitioner and the 5th Respondent to which the

electricity supply is applied for, the 4th Respondent should have followed the above-

mentioned provisions of the Act and Rules and refer the matter to the Commission. In

Jinadasa Vs Celon Electricity Board and Others4, Sripavan, J. held that,

4 (2005) 2 SLR 13.

It is imperative that the procedure laid down in the Electricity Act should be

properly observed. The provisions of the statute in this respect are supposed to

provide safeguards to the petitioner. It is only by procedural fairness

administrative powers are rendered tolerable. When an administrative act is

challenged through judicial review, the court is concerned with the legality of

the order made. Where proper procedures are not followed, the court will not

hesitate to strike down the impugned order as being ultra vires.

The position of the learned DSG is that as mentioned in P20 the 4th Respondent has

taken steps to provide electricity to the property temporarily after considering the

undertaking given by the 5th Respondent on an affidavit that he will not object if the 1st

Respondent takes steps to discontinue the electricity supply on an order of a court or

any other authority and in such a situation the 5th Respondent will bear expenses for the

same. Neither the learned DSG brought the attention of the Court to any legal provision

where a temporary electricity connection could be given when there is a dispute

between two parties for the ownership and/or occupation of the land which the

electricity supply is applied for nor the Court could find any such provision in the Act.

After considering all the facts hereinbefore-stated, provisions of the Act and the judicial

pronouncement of Sripavan, J., I hold that the decision of the 4th Respondent mentioned

in P20 and the supply of electricity to the land in dispute without following the

procedure laid down in the Act is illegal, unreasonable, arbitrary and prima facie ultra

vires and therefore it is liable to be quashed by a Writ of Certiorari. The Court issues a

11

mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision mentioned in P20

and a writ of Mandamus directing the 1st to 4th Respondents to disconnect the electricity

connection and supply given to the land in dispute. Accordingly, the Court grants the

reliefs sought in the prayers (b) and (e) to the Petition.

Under the circumstances mentioned above, it is the view of this Court that the 4th

Respondent has given electricity to the land knowing well that the Act does not confer

powers upon the 1st Respondent to provide temporary electricity connection and supply

in situations where there are disputes between the parties for the ownership and/or

occupation of the property for which the electricity supply is applied. This Court cannot

approve such arbitrary illegal and deliberate acts and decisions of the decision-makers.

Therefore, the 4th Respondent should personally pay a sum of Rs. 75,000/- to the

Petitioner as costs of this action and should bear the cost which will be incurred by the

1st Respondent to discontinue the electricity supply given to the subject matter.
