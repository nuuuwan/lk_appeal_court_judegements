The corpus, who was engaged in collecting metal and plastic at the Meethotamulla garbage

site, was abducted by unidentified individuals on 02nd of February 2012. This incident was

witnessed by a local resident, Mohammed Hussain. During the abduction, a magazine

cartridge was dropped by the abductors and subsequently handed over to the Police. The

family of the corpus promptly lodged a complaint with the Wellampitiya Police Station.

Despite this complaint, no information about the corpuss whereabouts was obtained.

Consequently, the Petitioner and his family sought assistance from various organizations to

locate the corpus. The Petitioner asserts that, notwithstanding these efforts, he received no

information regarding the whereabouts of the corpus, and the Police were unable to trace him.

On 10th March 2012, an attempt to abduct the corpuss brother, Ravindra Udeshantha

Dodampe Gamage, was thwarted, and four individuals were apprehended. Mohammed

Hussain, the earlier witness to the corpus's abduction, identified two of these apprehended

individuals as being present during the corpuss abduction. The Petitioner promptly reported

this identification to the Wellampitiya Police. The Petitioner was informed by the Police that

the apprehended individuals were members of the Sri Lanka Army and would be produced in

court. According to the aforementioned reasons the Petitioner alleges that the corpus is being

unlawfully detained by the Sri Lanka Army.

However, on 11th of March 2012, the Petitioner was informed by the Police that the

apprehended individuals had been released to the custody of the Sri Lanka Army and had not

been presented before the Court. The Petitioner contends that no proper investigation has

been conducted regarding the whereabouts of the corpus. Furthermore, there is no evidence

Page 4 of 5

whatsoever that either the Sri Lanka Police or the Sri Lanka Army having conducted any

investigation on the incident and the allegations.

On 22nd of February 2013, the Court of Appeal referred this application to the Chief

Magistrate in Colombo for an inquiry and a report regarding the arrest and alleged detention

in question. The Chief Magistrate conducted an inquiry and submitted findings to the Court

of Appeal on 1st of August 2019. In the report, the Chief Magistrate concluded that an

abduction has been confirmed and that the Police have not conducted a proper investigation

regarding it.

Upon review of the materials before us, it is clear that the identity card numbers and

photographs of the individuals in question were obtained from the Police when handing them

over. Not only have the police failed to conduct an investigation into the matter, but they

have also neglected to present the suspected individuals before a Magistrate as required by

law. Instead, the police have simply transferred the custody of these individuals to the Army,

citing their status as Army officers, without any further legal process or even an investigation.

Due to the negligence of the Officer in Charge of Police, Wellampitiya, who is the 3rd

Respondent in this case and his subordinates, a thorough and proper inquiry was not

conducted into the abduction of the corpus, nor into any subsequent attempt of abduction. As

a result, there remains a lack of accountability and transparency in addressing the serious

nature of these incidents, which has contributed to creating an atmosphere of impunity around

such offenses.

In the light of above, I am of the view that the fundamental rights of the corpus and the

Petitioner which is affirmed by Article 12 of the 3rd chapter of the Constitution, has

apparently been infringed.

Article 126(3) of the Constitution is quite precise in its position and the said Article

states clearly that if it appears to the Court of Appeal, while in the course of hearing an

application for orders in the nature of writs of habeas corpus, certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus or quo warranto, that there is prima facie evidence of an

Page 5 of 5

infringement or an imminent infringement of fundamental rights, such matter should

forthwith be referred to the Supreme Court for determination.

Therefore, I am of the view that this is a fit and proper case to be considered by the Supreme

Court and accordingly this matter is referred to the Supreme Court under Article 126(3) of

the Constitution.
