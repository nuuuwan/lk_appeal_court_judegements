Introduction

The Respondent-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the 'Petitioner')

seeks, inter alia, to set aside the order made by the learned High Court Judge of

Galle on 29th April 2024, dismissing the Petitioners appeal, and to direct the

learned High Court Judge of Galle to hear the appeal on its merits.

When this matter was supported, the Court, being satisfied with the facts, ordered

the issuance of notice to the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the Respondent). Despite the Court issuing notice to the

Respondent on four separate occasions, the Respondent failed to appear and was

not represented. As a result, the Court fixed the matter for argument. On the date

set for argument, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner moved to submit written

submissions in lieu of oral arguments. Accordingly, the written submissions

were filed, and the matter was reserved for judgment.

Relevant facts

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) filed an application at the Labour Tribunal of Matara against the

Petitioner. The facts of this application indicate that approximately 800 similar

applications had been filed at the Labour Tribunal of Matara. Of these

applications, the Labour Tribunal delivered judgments in 39 cases on 28th April

2023, ruling in favour of the applicants.

The aggrieved applicants appealed the aforementioned judgments to the High

Court of Matara.

The Petitioner states that shortly after the filing of those appeals, the then High

Court Judge of Matara summoned the Petitioners Legal Officer from Matara

and her Counsel to his chambers. Upon observing that hundreds of similar

4

CA/CPA/0050/2024

applications were pending in the Labour Tribunal of Matara, which could

potentially be appealed to the High Court of Matara, the Judge informed them

that the Matara High Court has a heavy case load. As a result, he advised that no

further appeals of this nature be filed there, and instead, such appeals could be

filed in either the Hambantota or Tangalle High Courts, as appeals may be lodged

in any High Court within the province. The Appellant has submitted an affidavit

from the Registered Attorney of the Appellant in support of these facts.

However, no such affidavit was filed by the Counsel, leaving this statement

uncorroborated. On the other hand, this Court has no means to verify the

accuracy of the statement attributed to the relevant judge. As such, I will not

place significant reliance on the aforementioned facts. Moreover, they are not

directly relevant to the core issue under consideration, namely the dismissal of

the appeal by the learned High Court Judge of Galle. Nonetheless, I wish to stress

that judges must remain prepared to adjudicate any legitimate cases that come

before them, irrespective of their volume. In my view, it is not a healthy practice

for the Judiciary for one Judge to shift their responsibility onto another Judge. In

the case of Ramalingam v. Parameswary and others1 (C.A.) His Lordship

Wigneswaran J., observed that easing the workload is the most unfortunate and

selfish reason for transferring a case.

Subsequently, the Labour Tribunal of Matara proceeded to deliver a judgment in

another case, ruling in favour of the applicant, against which the Petitioner filed

an appeal in the High Court of Matara. According to the Petitioner, the appeal

was accepted following the instructions of the learned High Court Judge, after

confirming that it was related to the 39 cases for which appeals were already

pending before the High Court of Matara. Later, on 20th March 2024, the Matara

Labour Tribunal delivered 32 judgments on similar applications, all of which

were unfavourable to the Petitioner.

The Petitioner states that on 28th March 2024, the Petitioners Legal Officer in

Matara and the Counsel visited the Matara High Court to verify the situation.

1 [2000] 2 Sri. L.R. 340.

5

CA/CPA/0050/2024

They attempted to obtain a written statement from the Registrar of the Matara

High Court before filing the new appeals in any other High Court, but were

unsuccessful in doing so.

Thereafter, for whatever the reason, the Petitioner filed 33 appeals in the High

Court of Galle on 22nd April 2024. These appeals were accepted by the registry

and assigned numbers ranging from LTAP/1681/2024 to LTAP/1713/2024.

The Petitioner claims that on 29th April 2024, the learned High Court Judge of

Galle, without providing an opportunity for a hearing to the Appellant (the

Petitioner in the present application), proceeded to make the impugned order,

dismissing all the appeals, including the present appeal. This is a clear violation

of the principle of natural justice, audi alteram partem. Additionally, it is stated

that the said order was never communicated to the Petitioner. The certified copy

of the order filed by the Petitioner indicates that there was no appearance on

behalf of either party in the High Court of Galle.

The learned High Court Judge of Galle observed that, since the appeal stemmed

from an order made by the Labour Tribunal of Matara, it should have, under

ordinary circumstances, been filed in the High Court of Matara. I concede that

the Petitioner ought to have pursued this course of action. Nevertheless, as per

the prevailing law, the Appellant is entitled to file the appeal in any of the High

Courts within the province.

Governing statutory provisions

To clarify the position above, I will first cite the relevant provisions of the

applicable statutes below.

Article 154 (P) of the Constitution provides as follows;

154P (1) There shall be a High Court for each Province with effect from the

date on which this Chapter comes into force. Each such High Court shall be

designated as the High Court of the relevant Province.

6

CA/CPA/0050/2024

Accordingly, the High Courts of the Provinces were established, and the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 was enacted,

with Sections 3 and 4 reading as follows:

3. A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a Province

shall, subject to any law, exercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of orders made by Labour Tribunals within that Province and orders

made under section 5 or section 9 of the Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979,

in respect of any land situated within that Province.

4. A party aggrieved by any conviction, sentence or order, entered or imposed,

by a Magistrate's Court, a Primary Court, a Labour Tribunal or by an order made

under section 5 or section 9 of the Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979 may,

subject to the provisions of any written law applicable to the procedure and

manner for appealing and the time for preferring such appeals, appeal therefrom

to the High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for the

Province within which such court or tribunal is situated or within which the

land which is the subject of the order made under the Agrarian Services Act, is

situated.

Section 31D (3) of the Industrial Dispute Act No. 43 of 1950 as amended by Act

No. 32 of 1990

31D (3). Where the workman who, or the trade union which, makes an

application to a labour tribunal, or the employer to whom that application

relates is dissatisfied with that application relates is dissatisfied with the order

of the tribunal on that application, such workman, trade union or employer may,

by written petition in which the other party is mentioned as the respondent,

appeal form that order on a question of law, to the High Court established under

Article 154P of the Constitution, for the Province within which such labour

tribunal is situated. (Emphasis added)

Application of the statutory provisions

7

CA/CPA/0050/2024

In the case of Kaluthanthrige Dona Jayaseeli v. Kaluthanthrige Dona

Dayawathi and six others2 His Lordship Priyantha Jayawardena, P.C. J., in His

Lordships judgment, interpreted the phrase within such province in Section

5A (1) of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of

1990, as amended. This interpretation pertains to appeals originating from the

District Courts or Family Courts.

Be that as it may, His Lordship referred to the definition of the word within as

provided in the 2nd Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary, which states:

In the limits of, or in the inner part of, a space or regent, especially a city or

country, in the place or realm.

The definitions of the word within provided in the Collins English Dictionary

and the Compact Oxford English Dictionary were also cited, which read as

follows:

Not beyond the limits of and inside the range of bounds of respectively

Consequently, the Supreme Court determined that any High Court located within

the Western Province has the authority to hear all appeals and revision

applications arising from the judgments and orders delivered by any District

Court or Family Court within the Western Province.

Section 31C (3) of the Industrial Disputes Act states that an appeal from an order

made by the Labor tribunal on a question of law shall be presented, () to the

High Court established under Article 154P of the Constitution, for the province

within which such Labour Tribunal is situated ().

Section 3 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act states that,

A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a province

() shall exercise appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of orders

made by Labour Tribunals within that province.

CA/CPA/0050/2024

Analysis

The phrases for the provinces and for a province mentioned above are

comparable to the phrase within such province which was interpreted by the

Supreme Court to mean any High Court located within the province.

Therefore, in line with the Supreme Court's decision, I concede that under

Section 31C (3) of the Industrial Disputes Act and Section 3 of the High Court

of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, the High Courts of Matara,

Hambantota, Tangalle, Galle, and Balapitiya all within the Southern province

possess jurisdiction to hear appeals against orders made by any Labour Tribunal

within the province, including the Labour Tribunal of Matara.

The concept of multiple courts having territorial jurisdiction to hear a case is not

unfamiliar in our legal framework. For instance, Section 9 of the Civil Procedure

Code permits a plaintiff to institute an action in a District Court within whose

local limits the defendant resides, the land in question is situated, the cause of

action arises, or the contract sought to be enforced was made.

The learned High Court Judge, in her reasoning in the impugned order, stated

that allowing the appeals to be filed in the High Court of Galle, instead of the

High Court of Matara where the Labour Tribunal made the order, and choosing

the High Court of Galle while overlooking the High Courts of Hambantota,

Tangalle, and Balapitiya, amounted to forum shopping. In the Indian case of

Michael Builders and Developers v The Indian Nursing Council3, Justice Swarna

Kanta Sharma defined, forum shopping to mean attempt to choose a forum

favourable

Blacks Law Dictionary4 defines forum shopping to mean; The practice of

choosing the most favourable jurisdiction or court in which a claim might be

heard.

9

CA/CPA/0050/2024

Merriam Webster Dictionary defines forum shopping to mean; The practice of

choosing the court in which to bring an action from among courts that could

properly exercise jurisdiction based on determination of which court is likely to

provide the most favourable outcome.

It appears that the learned High Court Judge of Galle was aware that a significant

number of similar appeals had been filed in the High Court of Matara, and the

refusal of the Matara High Court to accept further appeals prompted the filing of

the present appeal in the High Court of Galle. Nonetheless, as correctly observed

by the learned High Court Judge, the reason for not filing the appeals in the High

Courts of Hambantota, Tangalle, or Balapitiya remains unexplained.

Nevertheless, dismissing the appeal without providing a hearing to either the

Appellant or the Respondent cannot be justified.

Since there is an apparent reason for filing the appeal outside the Matara High

Court, I am not inclined to accept it as a deliberate choice of forum.

The High Court, established under the 1978 Constitution, was the highest court

of first instance exercising criminal jurisdiction and was referred to as The High

Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka5' Even under Section 2 of the Judicature

Act, then High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka was one of the courts of first

instance established for the administration of justice in the Republic of Sri Lanka.

However, the 11th Amendment to the Constitution repealed Article 111(1) and

introduced the provision: High Court of Sri Lanka which shall exercise such

jurisdiction and powers as Parliament may by law vest or ordain. Since then,

the High Court is no longer a court of first instance.

However, even after the repeal and replacement of Section 2 of the Judicature

Act by the Judicature (Amendment) Act No. 34 of 2022, the High Court of the

Republic of Sri Lanka and the provincial High Courts established under Article

154P (2) of the Constitution continue to be designated as courts of first instance

5 Article 111(1) of the 1978 Constitution now repealed.

10

CA/CPA/0050/2024

in the Judicature Act. Nonetheless, constitutional provisions should take

precedence over general law.

Under Article 111 of the Constitution, appointments of High Court judges are

made to the High Court of Sri Lanka. The composition of High Court judges

must comply with Section 4 of the Judicature Act. From among the judges of the

High Court of Sri Lanka, His Lordship the Chief Justice nominates the required

number of judges to serve in each High Court, as specified under Article 154P

(2) of the Constitution.

Section 3 of the Judicature Act stipulates that, for the purpose of administering

justice, Sri Lanka is divided into territorial units comprising Judicial Zones,

Judicial Districts, and Judicial Divisions. Under Section 5(1) of the Act, a

Judicial District represents the territorial jurisdiction of a District Court, while a

Judicial Division corresponds to the territorial jurisdiction of a Magistrates

Court.

In terms of the Judicature Act, the High Court is vested with jurisdiction to hear,

try, and determine all prosecutions for offenses triable on indictment by a High

Court, provided such offenses were wholly or partly committed within the

respective judicial zone6. In addition, the High Court of Colombo inter alia

exercised Admiralty jurisdiction7.

Article 105, which serves as the constitutional basis for establishing courts for

the administration of justice, remains intact since its enactment. The High Court

of the Republic of Sri Lanka is one of such institutions established in terms of

Article 105. Article 105 enacts that it is subject to the provisions of the

Constitution. Consequently, the High Couts are established subject to the other

provisions of the Constitution.

11

CA/CPA/0050/2024

The 13th Amendment to the Constitution introduced a new Chapter XVIIA.

Article 154P (1) of the above chapter provided for the establishment of a High

Court in each Province and mandated these courts to exercise, according to law,

the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court of Sri Lanka for offences

committed within the province8.

Further, notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law,

exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions,

sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary

Courts within the province9.

It was also granted the power to exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as

Parliament may, by law, provide10.

Every such High Court also have jurisdiction to issue, according to law, orders

in the nature of habeas corpus, in respect of persons illegally detained within the

province; and order in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition, procedendo,

mandamus and quo warranto against any person exercising, within the province,

any power under any law; or any statutes made by the Provincial Council

established for that province, in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial

Council list.

Jurisdiction can be categorized into two types: territorial jurisdiction and subject

matter jurisdiction.

Article 154P (1) of the Constitution provides that each province shall have a

High Court, referred to as the High Court of the relevant province. Through the

years, multiple High Courts have been established within the provinces,

functioning as the High Court of the province in various cities. The judicial zones

of these High Courts are determined and published through official Gazette

notifications.

8 Article 154P (3) (a). 9 Article 154P (3) (b). 10 Article 154P (3) (c).

12

CA/CPA/0050/2024

According to Section 9(1) of the Judicature Act, the High Court has the power

and authority to hear, try, and determine, on indictment, the offences specified

in subsections 9(1)(a) to (f) committed within the zone. However, this

jurisdiction is subject to the provisions of Section 9(2) of the Act. Consequently,

an offence committed in Sri Lanka under paragraph 9(1)(a) is ordinarily tried by

the High Court holden in the judicial zone where the offence was committed. For

offences specified in Section 9(1)(b) to (f), jurisdiction is exercised by the High

Court holden in the judicial zone nominated by His Lordship the Chief Justice.

Accordingly, Section 9(2)(a) of the Judicature Act restricts the jurisdiction of

High Courts to try, hear, and determine offences committed within Sri Lanka, as

outlined in Section 9(1)(a), to those offences committed within their designated

judicial zones. Although Article 154P(3)(a) of the Constitution refers to offences

committed within the province, it is qualified by the requirement that the High

Court of the province exercises its original criminal jurisdiction according to

law. This qualification enables the corresponding provision of the Judicature Act

to function effectively.

Article 154P (b) grant the High Court, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of convictions and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and

Primary Courts within the province, notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and

subject to any law.

Article 154P (c) grants the power to exercise such other jurisdiction and power

Parliament may provide, by law.

There is no reference in Article 154P to the orders made by Labour Tribunals

and orders made under the Agrarian Services Act.

Subsequently, the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19

of 1990 was enacted, reaffirming the provisions of Article 154P(3)(b) of the

Constitution. Under Section 4 of the Act, the right of appeal was granted to any

party aggrieved by a conviction, sentence, or order made by a Magistrate's Court

or a Primary Court, allowing appeals to the High Court established for the

province where such court is located. Additionally, the Act extended the right of

13

CA/CPA/0050/2024

appeal to the High Court of the province where the relevant labour tribunal or

the land subject to an order under the Agrarian Services Act is located.

It is noteworthy that the High Court of the Provinces Act does not address the

original criminal jurisdiction of the High Courts established for the provinces.

As a result, the original criminal jurisdiction of these courts is governed by the

Constitution and the applicable provisions of the Judicature Act. Meanwhile, the

appellate jurisdiction is governed by both the Constitution and the High Court of

the Provinces Act, while the revisionary jurisdiction is directly governed by the

Constitution itself.

As a result, the High Courts of Provinces exercise original criminal jurisdiction

within their designated judicial zones, whereas their appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction encompasses the entire province.

At this stage, it is important to note that, unlike the right of appeal to the Court

of Appeal granted under Sections 14, 15, and 16 of the Judicature Act in respect

of the High Court's exercise of original criminal jurisdiction, no provisions are

made regarding the right of appeal for cases involving the High Court's appellate,

revisionary, or other jurisdictions under Article 154P(3)(b) and (c).

Consequently, the right of appeal in these cases, as well as for orders made under

Article 154P (4), is granted by the Constitution under Article 154P (6).

It is significant to observe that Article 154P (6) does not address appeals in

relation to the exercise of original criminal jurisdiction by the High Court; these

provisions are contained in Sections 14, 15, and 16 of the Judicature Act. This

distinction further highlights that the legislature has made a clear separation

between the right of appeal concerning the exercise of original criminal

jurisdiction by the High Court and those concerning appellate, revisionary, and

other jurisdictions.

As I have already stated above, the phrase according to law in Article

154P(3)(a) allows the provisions in the Judicature Act to operate, thereby

limiting the territorial jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court to its respective

14

CA/CPA/0050/2024

judicial zone, as Article 154P(3)(a) pertains to offences committed within the

province.

One could argue that, according to Section 17 of the Judicature Act, the

jurisdiction of the High Courts is confined to the judicial zones specified under

Section 3 of the Act. Therefore, it might be contended that the appellate,

revisionary, and other jurisdictions are also limited to these judicial zones.

However, Section 17 explicitly states that it is subject to the other provisions of

the Judicature Act. As such, since the application of judicial zones under the

Judicature Act is primarily limited to original criminal jurisdiction as per Section

9, it cannot be extended to other types of jurisdictions.

Moreover, it is crucial to emphasize that a constitutional provision cannot be

overridden by ordinary legislation. Therefore, specific provisions set by the

Constitution would take precedence over the provisions of the Judicature Act.

Sections 14, 15, and 16 of the Judicature Act pertain to the right of appeal for

offences tried by the High Court exercising its original criminal jurisdiction.

These sections provide that a right of appeal from the High Court is granted to

the Court of Appeal.

However, as previously noted, the provincial High Court of Sri Lanka, in

addition to its original criminal jurisdiction, holds appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction under Article 154P(3)(b) of the Constitution. It is also vested with

writ jurisdiction under Article 154P (4) and any additional jurisdiction conferred

by Parliament through legislation under Article 154P(3)(c).

Following the enactment of the Judicature (Amendment) Act No. 34 of 2022,

both the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and the High Courts established

for the Provinces under Article 154P of the Constitution are designated as courts

of first instance for the administration of justice in Sri Lanka11. However, this

does not imply the existence of two distinct types of High Courts in the country.

11 Section 2 of the Judicature Act as amended by Act No. 34 of 2022.

15

CA/CPA/0050/2024

Rather, both names are acknowledged, possibly due to certain statutory

provisions that specifically reference the High Court of the Republic.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that the room available for an appeal to

be filed in any of the High Courts within the province, by passing the High Court

within zone within which the original court or tribunal is situated is an issue need

to be addressed by the Legislature. The deficiencies in the statutes may give rise

to opportunities for forum shopping. However, legislation is the prerogative of

the Legislature and should not be taken in by courts under the guise of

interpretation.

In an appropriate case, filing an appeal in a High Court other than the nearest

one within the province, without a valid reason, could be construed as forum

shopping.

Final conclusion on the impugned order

For the reasons outlined above in this judgment regarding jurisdiction, I set aside

the impugned order made by the learned High Court Judge of Galle on the 29th

April 2024 refusing to accept the appeal filed by the Appellant.

Ruling on the appropriate court to adjudicate the appeal

Under the Industrial Disputes Act, an applicant whose services have been

terminated can file an application against the termination in any Labour Tribunal

within Sri Lanka. Unlike first-instance courts such as the High Courts, District

Courts, and Magistrate Courts, the territorial jurisdiction of the Labour Tribunal

is not limited to a specific province, judicial zone, district, division or zone as

published in the Gazette.

Provincial High Courts are identified as the High Courts of their respective

provinces, and District Courts are referred to as the District Court of the

corresponding judicial district. Similarly, Magistrates Courts are designated as

the Magistrates Court of the relevant judicial division. In contrast, Labour

Tribunals are uniquely identified by numbers, as their jurisdiction extends across

the entire island.

16

CA/CPA/0050/2024

The reason not to assign a limited territorial jurisdiction may stem from the

intention to give the applicant, who is often the weaker party in most cases, the

opportunity to select the most convenient option.

Accordingly, the Respondent in this application (the applicant before the Labour

Tribunal) has opted to file her application with the Labour Tribunal of Matara,

as it is the closest tribunal to her residence in Kadamaditta, Madamulana.

The closest High Court to the Labour Tribunal of Matara is the High Court of

Matara. While the High Courts of Hambantota and Tangalle may be closer to the

residence of the Respondent, there is no evidence before this Court to support

this fact.

The Petitioner has chosen to file this appeal in the High Court of Matara;

however, the reasons outlined above, which are best known to the Petitioner,

have led to the decision to file it in the High Court of Galle, located

approximately 50 km from the High Court of Matara. Undoubtedly, this creates

an additional burden for the Respondent, whose residence is located to the east

of Matara, as she must travel to the High Court of Galle on the western side of

Matara, bypassing the High Court in Matara to resolve her appeal.

There can be no doubt that the Legislature's intention in establishing Provincial

High Courts was to provide litigants with easier access to justice. The closer the

courts are to the litigant, the more convenient and efficient the litigation process

becomes.

Under Section 46 (1)(d) of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 the Court of Appeal

has the authority to transfer cases from one Court to another. The grounds for

such transfers are outlined in Section 46 (1) (a) to (d). Section 46 (1) (d) states

that this Court could transfer a case if it appears that it is so expedient on any

other ground, other than the grounds stated in 46 (1) (a) to (c). However, the

Sinhala text of Section 46 (1) () reads as

.

17

CA/CPA/0050/2024

Accordingly, I observe an inconsistency between the English and Sinhala texts.

In terms of Article 23(1) of the Constitution, laws are enacted or made and

published in Sinhala and Tamil, along with a translation in English. Therefore,

since the English text is only a translation, the Sinhala text must prevail over the

English text.

In light of the foregoing analysis, I am of the view that this appeal should be

transferred to the High Court of Matara. Accordingly, exercising the powers

conferred by Section 46(1)(d) of the Judicature Act read with Section 2(2) of the

High Court of the Provinces (Special Provinces) Act No. 19 0f 1990, I hereby

order that the appeal be transferred to the High Court of Matara.

Conclusion

The High Court Judge of Galle is hereby directed to remit the appeal brief, along

with a copy of this judgment, to the High Court of Matara forthwith.

The sitting High Court Judge of Matara is directed to follow the standard

procedure for appeals from Labour Tribunals and to expedite the resolution of

the appeal.

Application allowed. No costs.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to communicate this judgment to the High

Court of Galle and the Labour Tribunal of Matara.
