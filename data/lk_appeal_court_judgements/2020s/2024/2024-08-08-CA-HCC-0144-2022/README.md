JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named 1st Accused-Respondent was indicted by the Attorney

General in the High Court of Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d)

of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act

No. 13 of 1984 for Possession and Trafficking of 59.88 grams of Heroin

(diacetylmorphine) on 09th January 2013.

The 2nd Accused-Respondent was indicted for adding and abetting 1st

Accused-Respondent for possession of 59.88 grams of Heroin

(diacetylmorphine) under Section 54(A) (b) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984.

The case was called on 16.06.2015 to service of the indictment. The

Respondents were present and duly represented by their Counsel.

Indictments were served and the Respondents were released on fresh bail.

The case was fixed for trial on 26.10.2016.

On 26.10.2016 PW1 IP/Rangajeeva was absent as he was summoned by

High Court of Panadura to give evidence in a partly heard matter. Therefore,

the trial was re-fixed for 08.02.2017.

CA/HCC/144/22

On 08.02.2017 PW1 was absent and the trial was re-fixed for 05.05.2017.

On that day although PW1 and PW2 were present, the trial could not be

commenced due to non-availability of Police Information Books. As such, the

case was re-fixed for trial on 20.07.2017.

On 20.07.2017 it was reported that PW1 was hospitalized and receiving

treatment. Hence, the trial was re-fixed for 12.09.2017. On that day the

Counsel for the Respondent moved for a date due to his ill-health. Therefore,

the trial was re-fixed for 17.11.2017.

On 17.11.2017 a date was moved due to ill-health of PW1 and the trial was

re-fixed for 25.06.2018. On that day it was reported that the PW1 was in

remand and notice was issued through the prison. Hence the trial was again

re-fixed for 03.10.2018. On that day too PW1 was absent and summons

issued to PW1 and PW3 returnable on 16.01.2019.

On 16.01.2019 the State Counsel brought to the notice of the Court that

PW1 was not stable due to gunshot injuries he had received. Therefore, an

application was made to call for a medical report of PW1 through Judicial

Medical Officer of Colombo. The Court allowed the application and re-fixed

the trial on 24.05.2019.

On 25.05.2019 neither PW1 nor his MLR was produced in Court. As such, a

warrant was issued against PW1 and a notice was issued against the Officer-

in-Charge of the Pollice Narcotics Bureau and the trial was re-fixed for

10.09.2019.

On 10.09.2019 the State Counsel confirmed that PW1 had undergone a

medical check and requested the Court to issue an order to get the MLR of

PW1 directly to the High Court. Order was made accordingly and the trial

was re-fixed for 17.01.2020. On that day as the Learned High Court Judge

was on an official duty, trial was postponed for 10.06.2020 and PW1 and

PW3 were warned to appear on the next day.

CA/HCC/144/22

On 10.06.2020 the trail was postponed to 23.09.2020 as the Respondent

were absent to Court. On the next date of the trial the Learned State Counsel

informed Court that PW1 had undergone a heart surgery and was

convalescing at the Police Hospital. Therefore, move for summons and the

trial re-fixed for 15.02.2021.

Due to Covid pandemic the case was called several times as per the Judicial

Service Commission Circular No.JSC/SEC/COR 12 in absence of the

parties. Thereafter the case was fixed for trial on 31.08.2022.

On 31.08.2022 the trial was taken up and the indictment was read to the

Respondents who pleaded not guilty. After the opening address, the Learned

State Counsel informed Court that although the Police Narcotics Bureau had

informed him that PW1 is coming to the Colombo High Court No.04, the

witness was not present. Hence, he moved another date to start the trial.

The Learned High Court Judge considering the situation, ordered that the

case has come to an end technically. Therefore, he moved to discharge both

the Respondents from the case. The order of the Learned High Court Judge

is re-produced below:

Commenting on the above order, The Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor

General submitted that the order of the Learned High Court Judge is

manifestly illegal and erroneous and without any legal basis, as the case on

an indictment before the High Court could not have been brought to a

conclusion in such an abrupt manner. He further submitted that there is no

provision under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 to

discharge an accused at that stage of the trial. In this case the Respondent

were discharged by the Learned High Court without calling any witnesses.

In Attorney General v Gunawardena [1996] 2 SLR 149, the Court held that:

..it is important that a Judge should not, by a premature and erroneous

order that there is no case to go to the Jury, preclude the Jury from

performing its proper function of determining the credibility of witnesses,

the weighing of evidence, and the drawing of justifiable inference from

the proved facts and thereby arriving at a verdict.

In this case several dates have been passed between the service of the

indictment to the Respondents and the date of discharge.

PW1 was the chief investigation officer attached to the Police Narcotics

Bureau. When this case was fixed for trial, PW1 was summoned by other

CA/HCC/144/22

6 | P a g e

High Courts of the province to give evidence in similar matters. As such he

could not attend Court regularly. Further several intervention

circumstances, which are beyond the control of PW1, also prevented him

attending the Court. I think it is quite pertinent and important to mention

those circumstances in this judgment.

On 20.07.2017, it was informed to Court that PW1 was hospitalized and was

receiving treatment. On 25.06.2018 it was brought the notice of the Court

that PW1 was arrested for another case and was remanded. On 16.01.2019

the State Counsel informed the Court that as PW1 sustained gun shot

injuries few months before, he has developed some medical complications

including forgetfulness and difficulty in reading. As such, the State Counsel

requested an order to produced PW1 before the JMO Colombo and calling a

Report, if necessary, a Psychiatric Report directly to the High Court. In the

meantime, PW1 had undergone a heart surgery too.

According to the Psychiatric Report issued by Dr.C.T.K Fernando, Forensic

Psychiatric, which had been file of record, PW1 had sustained firearm injury

to his head in 2017. Due to that he has problem with remembering names,

dates etc. Further he is having difficulty in calculating, writing, and reading.

Also claims that he lost his capabilities in proper planning of events.

According to the assessment of the Forensic Psychiatric, PW1 was treated for

mental illness (PTSD & Depression) at the University Psychiatric Unit of Sri

Jayawardenapura and at the Prison Hospital, Welikada. Evidence of

traumatic brain injury also detected.

It is quite clear that PW1 had suffered gunshot injuries in the year 2017.

Hence, his absence commencing from 26.10.2016 need to be considered in

conjunction with his medical condition and practical difficulties he had to

face during the trial. The Learned High Court Judge should have considered

these factors when the State Counsel requested for another chance to call

PW1 whos evidence is very critical to this case.

CA/HCC/144/22

A judge has the power to adjourn a matter on the day of hearing. This

decision is wholly within the discretion of the judge. An appellate court will

only interfere with such a decision if the judge has erred in exercising that

discretion or not exercised his/her discretion at all.

In DPP v Gursel Ozakca & Anor [2006] NSWSC 1425 it was held that:

the failure to grant an adjournment meant the prosecutor was denied

natural justice. This meant that the magistrate had constructively

failed to exercise his jurisdiction.

In Attorney General v Manjula Prasanna Kumara Perera

CA/CPA/163/22 decided on 04.12.2023 Sapath Abayakoon,J. held that:

I find no justification to discharge the Respondent from the High

Court proceedings on the basis that the prosecution has failed to serve

summons on PW1 as there is no such procedure available to discharge

an accused person on that basis.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge appears to have been acted in

misconception and miscomprehension of the powers vested in a High Court

in terms of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of

1979. He failed to considering the circumstances under which PW1 failed to

appear before the High Court.

Therefore, I set aside the order dated 31.08.2022 of the Learned High Court

Judge of Colombo and order that case shall be revert back to the case role of

the Court.

CA/HCC/144/22

8 | P a g e

The Learned High Court Judge is directed to issue notice on the Respondents

and fix the matter for trial and to proceed therefrom in accordance with the

law.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
