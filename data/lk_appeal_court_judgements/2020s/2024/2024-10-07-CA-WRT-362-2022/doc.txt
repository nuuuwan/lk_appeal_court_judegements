i. For costs, and

j. For such other and further relief as to Your Lordships' Court shall seem fit and

The Facts of this case, albeit briefly, are as follows:

The Petitioner claims that he occupies a land situated in Kalmunai to an extent of 4.5

perches by virtue of an annual permit bearing No. AM/KP/AL/144 issued in terms of

State Lands Ordinance No 8 of 1947, as amended. Having obtained the said land, the

Petitioner claims, on or around 1977, to have constructed a shop on it, and since then to

have conducted commercial activities on it. In 1996, one of the Petitioners sons, one

Mohamed Aarif (the 7th Respondent), obtained an annual permit bearing No.

AM/KP/AL/146 to an extent of 4.4 perches of land adjoining the Petitioners land. On or

around 2007, the said lands were amalgamated, and a three-storey commercial building

had been constructed by the Petitioner and his son.

On or around 2008, the Petitioner made an application to the Divisional Secretary,

Kalmunai to obtain a long-term lease, based on an intimation from the State that it had

been decided to grant long-term leases on annual permits. According to the Petitioner,

his annual permit was regularly renewed until the end of 2010. The Petitioner stated

that he handed over his annual permit to the subject clerk to renew the annual permit

for the year 2011. By letter dated 12.01.2008, the Petitioner was asked to pay a fee to

Page 5 of 11

resurvey the said land. Somewhere in 2011, the Petitioner became aware that the

Respondents were planning to recommend the 7th Respondent for the purpose of issuing

a long-term lease on the basis that the Petitioner had given consent to transfer the said

land to the 7th Respondent.

The Petitioner objected saying that he had not consented as such. On 02.03.2018, the 7th

Respondent, one of the Petitioners sons, forcibly entered the building by breaking the

padlocks claiming that he was issued with a permit by the Divisional Secretary,

Kalmunai. The Petitioner lodged a Police Complaint and instituted an action in the

District Court of Kalmunai seeking an interim order preventing the 7th Respondent from

entering the building. The court on 29.08.2018 issued an interim injunction against the

7th Respondent.

Thereafter, during the pendency of proceedings before the District Court of Kalmunai,

the Petitioner, through his lawyer, by letter dated 19.06.2018, requested the Assistant

Commissioner of Lands to conduct a fresh inquiry on the dispute over the said land. On

his request, the Assistant Commissioner of Lands by letter dated 19.06.2018 directed

the Deputy Land Commissioner in Ampara to conduct an inquiry. By letter dated

05.06.2018, the Petitioner was asked to be present for an inquiry on 17.07.2018.

However, the Petitioner claims to have received only the said letter only on 16.07.2018.

The Petitioner had informed that he would not be able to attend the said inquiry.

Thereafter, by letter dated 09.06.2018, the Petitioner was asked to be present on

24.07.2018 for an inquiry. In the meantime, the Petitioner has received a letter dated

17.07.2018 from the said Commissioner indicating a letter submitted by the Petitioner

consenting to transfer the land to the 7th Respondent and for a long-term lease to be

given to the 7th respondent on the following conditions:

i. All income generated from the building situated in the said land should go to

the Petitioner until his death.

ii. The 7th Respondent should take the responsibility of maintaining his father

since he is sick.

Later, the Petitioner came to know that the Kalmunai Divisional Secretary, the 6th

Respondent recommended the long-term lease to be given to the 7th Respondent.

Further, the 5th Respondent requested the Petitioner by letter dated 02.03.2020, marked

as P27, to be present for an inquiry on 05.03.2020. During the said inquiry, the

Page 6 of 11

Petitioner and the 7th Respondent were present, and their statements were recorded.

The Petitioner denied signing such a document and handing over the property to the 7th

Respondent.

Further, the official who conducted the inquiry observed that the annual permit issued

to the Petitioner, was not cancelled in accordance with Section 106 of the Land

Development Ordinance No. 19 of 1935 (as amended), and that the said annual permit

was renewed until 2010. The Committee observed that there was a recommendation of

the then Divisional Secretary, to grant the long-term lease to the Petitioner. Accordingly,

the Petitioner had paid the relevant fees. The said inquiry and findings are marked as

P53 in the counter objections. According to the Petitioner, these documents were

obtained only consequent to an order made by the Right to Information Commission in

an appeal.

Thereafter, by letter marked as P28 dated 25.11.2020, the then Provincial Land

Commissioner of the Eastern Province informed the Commissioner General of Lands

recommending that the Petitioner should be given the long-term lease. Acting on the

aforesaid recommendation, steps were taken to issue the long-term lease to the

Petitioner.

However, the 7th Respondent complained to the 3rd Respondent by letter dated

07.05.2021 with regard to the grant of a long-term lease to the Petitioner. Based on that,

the 2nd Respondent directed the 3rd Respondent to hold a fresh inquiry. According to the

7th respondent, the Petitioner had not participated in the said inquiry. Thereafter, the

Petitioner was informed by letter dated 27.06.2022, to participate in another inquiry on

21.07.2022. Through his lawyer, the Petitioner informed that he was unable to be

present on that said date. Without considering his application, the 2nd Respondent

directed the 4th Respondent to prepare the documents recommending the long-term

lease to the 7th Respondent. According to the Petitioner, the decision made by the 2nd

Respondent to grant the long-term lease to the 7th Respondent dated 23.03.2022 is

arbitrary on the basis that there existed recommendations by previous Land

Commissioners (as demonstrated by documents marked P28 and P34) recommending

the issuance of the long-term lease to the Petitioner.

Page 7 of 11

The main objection taken by the 1st to 6th Respondents is that the Petitioner is 94 years

of age and is not physically capable of developing the land. Therefore, the Assistant

Commissioner has recommended that it is not suitable to grant the long-term lease to

the Petitioner.

On the direction of this Court on 16.11.2023, the report of the Commissioner General of

Lands dated 04.11.2023 which is marked as R15 was submitted. According to the said

report, the 2nd Respondent based his recommendation on the following grounds:

.

i. 2011.04.07

.

ii. 07 39 2015.11.30

.

iii. 07

.

iv .

.

v . 94

.

The fact remains that, originally, the land was conferred on the Petitioner by an annual

permit. He had developed the land by constructing a three-storeyed building. Thereafter,

the Petitioner requested the Respondents to convert the annual permit to a long-term

lease. The Petitioner denies ever having consented to the 7th Respondent obtaining a

long-term lease.

Even if we presume the Petitioner has consented to transfer the said permit to 7th

Respondent, there is nothing to prevent him from changing his mind and refusing the

transfer in respect of the portion of land that forms the subject matter of his annual

permit or under which permit he occupies the land.

Page 8 of 11

Section 53 of the Land Development Ordinance reads as follows.

53. Cancellation of nominations

Any nomination of a successor may at any time be cancelled by the owner or

permit-holder who made such nomination.

One of the reasons given by the Respondents was that, since the Petitioner is an elderly

man, he cannot develop the land. The question arises, whether this consideration is

relevant.

It is established law that failure to consider a relevant consideration or the

consideration of an irrelevant consideration is tantamount to an illegality. Lord Denning

M.R. in Breen v. Amalgamated Engineering Union [1971] 2 QB 175 at 190 held:

The discretion of a statutory body is never unfettered. It is a discretion which is

to be exercised according to law. That means at least this: the statutory body

must be guided by relevant considerations and not by irrelevant. If its decision is

influenced by extraneous considerations which it ought not to have taken into

account, then the decision cannot stand. No matter that the statutory body may

have acted in good faith; nevertheless, the decision will be set aside.

Further, the failure to consider a relevant consideration, or the consideration of

an irrelevant consideration is considered as unreasonable in the umbrella or

general sense of the term unreasonable. As famously held by Lord Greene in the

evergreen judgment of Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd, v. Wednesbury

Corporation, 1948 1KB 223:

It is true the discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now what does that

mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology commonly used in relation to

exercise of statutory discretions often use the word " unreasonable" in a rather

comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a

general description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person

entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He

must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider. He

Page 9 of 11

must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has

to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is

said, to be acting " unreasonably." Similarly, there may be something so absurd

that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the

authority. Warrington L.J. in Short v. Poole Corporation (I) gave the example of

the red-haired teacher, dismissed because she had red hair. That is unreasonable

in one sense. In another sense it is taking into consideration extraneous matters.

It is so unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith;

and, in fact, all these things run into one another. [emphasis added]

As a matter of academic interest, the weight to be attributed to the consideration is a

matter for the relevant authority. If there is an exercise of power found to be

unreasonable in the substantive sense of unreasonableness (that is, the true

Wednesbury Unreasonableness, meaning, something so absurd that no sensible person

could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority) it is then that this

Court can interfere on the ground of Wednesbury Unreasonableness. This interplay

between the doctrine of relevant/irrelevant considerations and Wednesbury

Unreasonableness was made clear in the House of Lords judgment of Tesco Stores v.

Secretary of State for the Environment [1995] 2 All ER 636. Lord Keith at p. 642 held:

It is for the courts, if the matter is brought before them, to decide what is a

relevant consideration. If the decision-maker wrongly takes the view that

some consideration is not relevant, and therefore has no regard to it, his decision cannot

stand and he must be required to think again. But it is entirely for the decision-maker to

attribute to the relevant considerations such weight as he thinks fit, and the courts will

not interfere unless he has acted unreasonably in the Wednesbury sense (see Associated

Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp [1947] 2 All ER 680, [1948] 1 KB

223)

In the present application, we observe that in the face of the recommendations made by

the previous authorities to grant the long-term lease to the Petitioner, and the

Petitioners refusal to consent to granting a long-term lease to the 7th Respondent, the

2nd Respondents rejection of the Petitioners application for a long-term lease on the

Page 10 of 11

consideration that the Petitioner is too old is irrelevant. Accordingly, the decision is

unlawful.

We note that the statute does not appear to require age to be a consideration in deciding

such applications. Had the provisions of the statute been capable of such inference, age

would not have amounted to an irrelevant consideration.

Therefore, we quash the recommendation made by the 5th Respondent in his purported

letter dated 23.03.2022 recommending the grant of a long-term lease to the 7th

Respondent for the land which was given to the Petitioner in 1976 under the Annual

Permit bearing No. AM/KP/AL/144.

Accordingly, we issue writs of Certiorari as prayed in prayers (c) and (d), and writs of

mandamus as prayed in prayers (f) and (g). We order costs.

Before I part with judgment, let me also add the following.

When this case was argued on 30.07.2024, we directed the Learned State Counsel

appearing for the 1st to 6th Respondents to see whether the said Respondents have

considered the documents P28, P34 and P53 before drafting the Report marked R15.

The Learned Counsel for the said Respondents filed a motion on 30.08.2024 annexing

the reply given to them by Bandula Jayasinghe, the 2nd Respondent who is the

Commissioner General of Lands. According to the said letter, he has admitted the

following:

P 28, P 34 P 53 , 07

2023.01.04 .

This response shows the 2nd Respondents disregard for this Courts direction. The said

document marked R15 was prepared at the direction of this Court. It should be noted

that the 2nd Respondent is a public officer who holds a responsible position in the

administration of State Lands. This response, to ones sheer displeasure, speaks gravely

about the 2nd Respondents attitude towards the Court. In the absence of any justifiable

explanation as to why the said documents were not considered when those were

Page 11 of 11

specifically directed to be considered, we see it fit to order the 2nd Respondent, namely,

Mr. K.D. Bandula Jayasinghe, the Commissioner General of Lands, to pay Rupees Fifty

Thousand (Rs. 50,000/-) out of his personal funds to this Court within a period of one

month from the date of this judgment.

We direct the Registrar to send this judgment to the 2nd Respondent for his information.

Application allowed.
