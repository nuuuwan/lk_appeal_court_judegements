Court of Colombo, for the Years of Assessment 2010/2011, 2011/2012 and 2012/2013.

According to the petition, on or about 14. 06. 2023, while the Petitioner was overseas, he

has come to know through the local newspapers, that the 1st Respondent has instituted

proceedings against the Petitioner by way of a purported Certificate of Tax in Default in

the Chief Magistrates Court of Colombo in terms of Section 179 (1) of the Inland Revenue

Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended. According to the Petitioner, the particular action by the

Respondent is ultra vires, since, before the due conclusion and proper determination of

the Petitioners appeal, they have instituted this action in the Magistrates Court.

The facts of this case are as follows:

According to the document marked as R1, the Petitioner has made a request to the Inland

Revenue Department (IRD) to open an income tax file in his name as he was receiving a

remuneration of Rs. 900,000 from the Cosmos Telecommunication Ltd. acting in the

capacity as a Director for the accounting period of 2009/2010.

Page 4 of 10

Based on the request, the Petitioner was allocated the Tax File No. 7/6931/1/1. According

to paragraph 14 of the petition, the Petitioner admitted the fact that he has failed to

submit the returns for the years of assessment 2010/2011, 2011/2012, 2012/2013 within

time. According to the Respondent, the tax return for the year of assessment 2010/2011

was delayed by 13 months, the tax return for the year of assessment 2011/2012 was

delayed by 1 month and 16 days and the tax return for the year of assessment 2012/2013

was delayed by 5 months and 23 days.

In terms of Section 106 of the said Act, every person who is chargeable with income tax

shall on or before the 30th November immediately succeeding the end of that year of

assessment shall furnish to an assessor a return of his income.

Thereafter, by the letter dated 27.02.2015 which was marked as R3, the Respondent

requested the Petitioner to submit the following details.

1. Declarations of assets and liabilities as at 31.03.2012, 31.03.2013 and

31.03.2014.

2. Receipts and payments accounts for the above assessment years

3. Details of the movable and immovable properties that purchased or sold by you

during the period of 01.04.2011 31.03.2014.

4. Account numbers and details of all type Accounts/Deposits that you have

maintained in Banks/Financial Institutions during the period of 01.04.2011

31.03.2014.

5. 1. Audited accounts of the companies that you were a director or a shareholder

(other than Public Listed Companies) for the assessment years 2011/2012,

2012/2013, 2013/2014.

2. Extracts of the director current accounts of the above companies.

6. Names, number of shares and percentage of shares holding owned by you in

Public Listed Companies during the period of 01.04.2011 31.03.2014.

These documents were not indicated in the Petitioners petition. We are mindful that, at

any stage, the Petitioner has not diverged the assessor that the said Cosmos Group of

Companies do not belong to him. According to the Respondent, the said returns submitted

by the Petitioner were rejected by the assessor and by the letter dated 30.12.2016, the

Respondents have informed the Petitioner of the following reason for such rejection.

Page 5 of 10

Income declared by you for the year of assessment 2010/2011 is not sufficient to meet the

expenses made during the year. Difference between receipts and payments is treated as

undeclared taxable income.

The 2nd Respondent has mentioned that there is an undeclared additional income which

has not been disclosed by the Petitioner. The 2nd Respondent has formed the opinion that

the Petitioner has invested in the directors current accounts during those years. This

position was strengthened by the document marked as R12 where the Petitioner has sent

a letter to the Commissioner on 08.01.2019.

1. The drawings and withdrawals made from the respective companies where I

functioned as a Consultant was not for my personal consumption but as a cash flow

managements of the respective companies. Accordingly, when one company was in need

of working capital etc. funds were withdrawn from another company and deposited. In

this manner the total amounts withdrawn has been deposited to the respective companies

and there is documentary evidence available to prove same.

Thereafter, the 2nd Respondent has issued the notice of assessment indicating the tax

payable and the penalty in terms of Section 164 of the IRA. All three notices of assessment

were sent on 18.01.2017. In terms of Section 165 of the said Act, the Petitioner is entitled

to appeal against the notice of assessment issued by the assessor. Accordingly, the

Petitioner has submitted an appeal on 13. 02. 2017 against the notices of assessment

issued by the 2nd Respondent which were marked as R7(a), (b) and (c). In the said appeal,

he has stated that the estimate made by the Assistant Commissioner is grossly perverse

and unfair as the assessor had arrived at the additional liable income mainly considering

amounts declared as withdrawn in directors current account. But the Petitioner has not

indicated that he has no dealing with the directors current account. According to the

petition in paragraph 32 to 35, one Prasad Dimuthu Kumara, the accountant of several

Cosmos Companies, has appeared in the particular inquiry before the Assistant

Commissioner as the authorized representative of the Petitioner and has explained with

regard to the cash receipts and payments details. But he has not denied that particular

accounts were not used by the Petitioner. We note that, in the written submission filed

by the Petitioner dated 03.06.2024 in paragraph 16, the Commissioner General has

written to the Director of Criminal Investigation Department asking whether they have

any information regarding the Petitioner which was done according to Section 106 (20) of

the IRA. It shows that before the Commissioner made the determination, he has gathered

information of the Petitioner. According to the Petitioner, he has received a letter on

Page 6 of 10

12.02.2019 (P9) which contained the determination of the appeal, determined on

11.02.2019 according to Section 165 (13) of the IRA. These documents are marked as P9

and P10 which have been challenged by the Petitioner. We are of the view that P9 is a

communication to the Petitioner regarding the determination, there is no decision in the

particular document to be challenged by the Petitioner.

We are mindful that the Petitioners appeal does not contain any reference to the tax that

was paid. According to the Petitioner, the determination made by the 1st Respondent

which is marked as P10, is said to be ultra vires and that the Commissioner has not

followed the principles of natural justice. In response, the Respondent has indicated that

there were interviews held with the accountant and details and information were asked

by the Respondent. Especially in R8(d), the Commissioner has requested the details from

the Petitioner on 01.05.2018.

Therefore, you are kindly requested to submit the following documents on or before

15.05.2018 in order to settle the above appeal.

1. Declaration of assets and liabilities and receipts and payments accounts for the year

of assessment 2010/2011

2. Details breakup of payments for the following Companies as per receipts and

payments accounts of years of assessments 2011/2012, 2012/2013.

2011/2012 2012/2013

Cosmos Aviation Services (Pvt) Ltd 34,200,192 6,537,000

Cosmos Technology (Pvt) Ltd 42,854,017 15,213,000

Cosmos Leisure (Pvt) Ltd 14,349,000 51,215,000

Cosmos Security (Pvt) Ltd 4,089,094 -

Cosmos Plantation (Pvt) Ltd 18,235,604 18,140,020

Cosmos Printing (Pvt) ltd - 4,780,000

It shows that the 1st Respondent has considered all the details before making the

determination which is marked as P10.

Page 7 of 10

Also, in the document marked as R4, where the Petitioner himself has indicated that

under the column of receivable current account with related parties mentioned Cosmos

Technology, Cosmos Leisure, Cosmos Plantation and under column liability payable

Cosmos Aviation Service, Cosmos Printing and Cosmos Security.

It is clear that the Petitioner himself has admitted the fact that he has a direct

involvement with the particular current accounts.

According to the determination made by the Respondent marked as P10, he has confirmed

the assessment issued for the years 2010/2011, 2011/2012, 2012/2013.

When we consider the entire documents, the assessor has considered all the documents

placed before him, to reach at the determination. Also, the Commissioner General has

acted in accordance with the provisions of the said Act.

In the instant application, the main ground urged by the Petitioner is that the

assessments made by the 2nd Respondent in P6, P7 and P8 are ultra vires and ex facie

erroneous.

What is Ultra Vires was discussed in De, Smiths Judicial Review, Eighth Edition,

page 210,

The Ultra vires doctrine

In essence, the doctrine of ultra vires permits the courts to quash decisions made by

bodies exercising public functions which they have no power to make. Acting ultra vires

and acting without jurisdiction have essentially the same meaning, although in general

the term "vires" has been employed when considering administrative decisions and

delegated legislation, and "jurisdiction" when considering judicial decisions, or those

having a judicial flavour.

According to the document marked as R6, the 2nd Respondent has indicated the reason for

not accepting the returns for the said years of assessment. According to him, he has come

to the conclusion, based on the document filed by the Petitioner marked as R4. According

to R4, the Petitioner has declared the companies where he has received money and where

he has paid the money. On that footing, 2nd Respondent has come to the conclusion that,

the amounts invested in the directors current accounts by the Petitioner during those

years are considered as undeclared taxable income. Nevertheless, the onus of disproving

the undeclared income is on the Petitioner which he has failed to do.

Page 8 of 10

According to the R17, where the 1st Respondent gave reasons for the determination are

stated as follows:

In the absence of required details and information from the appellant, there is no any

other alternative other than the estimation of undeclared income based on the

information that he has already collected. Accordingly, the Commissioner has clearly

given his reasons in arriving to the undeclared income for above years of assessment. If

his calculations are not acceptable, it is the duty of appellant to prove that the calculations

are incorrect.

..

The Commissioner is not in a position to provide the information regarding all affairs of

the taxpayer including types or character of the income sources. Since the Commissioner

has explained the method of calculating the undeclared income in his letter of information,

now it is the Appellants duty to prove that there is no any undeclared income as

calculated by the Assistant Commissioner. Without providing sufficient details and

information to prove his position, it is not acceptable the reason given by the Appellant.

When we consider both the decisions, it is clear that both Respondents have acted

according to the law and evidence placed before them.

Grounds for issuing certiorari are mentioned by M.P. Jain and S.N. Jain in Principles of

Administrative Law, 6th Enlarged Edition, Volume 2, Page 2180.

The grounds for the issue of certiorari have been succinctly stated by the Supreme Court

in Syed Yakoob v. K.S. Radhakrishnan. Prohibition and Certiorari are issuable on the

following grounds:

i. When the concerned authority is acting or has acted under a law which is invalid,

ultra vires or unconstitutional;

ii. jurisdictional error;

iii. error of law apparent on the face of the record;

iv. findings of fact not supported by evidence;

v. failure of natural justice.

We hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish that the particular orders made by the

Respondents do not fall under any of the grounds mentioned above.

Page 9 of 10

In addition, the Petitioner in his submission has mentioned that, the determination made

by the 1st Respondent is not final. According to the Petitioner, by letter dated 30.08.2019,

the Respondent has informed the Petitioner that the matter has been referred to the

Commission for consideration. According to the Petitioners written submission in

paragraph 133, this amounts to an acknowledgement and admission by the CGIR of the

non-conclusion of the appeal. On the other hand, the Respondent stated that the

particular appeal has been duly determined and there is no provision to reopen.

We are mindful of the P9 dated 12.02.2019 where it has stated that if the Petitioner is

aggrieved by this determination, they have a right of appeal to the Tax Appeals

Commission in terms of Section 7 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011. On

that wording, it is clear that the appeal is concluded.

One of the objections taken by the Respondent is that Petitioner had an alternative

remedy to converse this decision. The Petitioner counters that there is no alternative

remedy by relying on two judgments in his submission. The Petitioners grievance is that

the assessors assessment is wrong.

I reproduce the judgments cited in the Petitioners submission. Accordingly,

In A.M. Ismail v. Commissioner of Inland Revenue, (1981) 2 SLR 78, at page 111,

it was held that;

It has power to review or annual an assessment if it is proved that an assessee

was not liable to pay the tax charged.

Mrs. D.M. S. Fernando and Another v. A. M. Ismail, (1982) IV SLTC 184, held

that

Those provisions confine him to an appeal against the quantum of assessment.

According to the above said judgments, there is an effective alternative remedy available

to the Petitioner to converse the matter before the TAC. But the Petitioner has failed to

appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission.

When we consider the documents in entirety, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy this court

that P6, P7 and P8 are amenable for writ of Certiorari.

Page 10 of 10

Therefore, for the above said reasons we dismiss this application with costs.
