III. On or about 13th January 2016, for accepting a gratification in a

sum of Rs.30,000/- from Muthu Bandage Jagath Disanayake, as

giving a recommendation to a cheque in order to realize the

cheque from the Bank of Ceylon) thereby committing an offence

punishable under section 19(b) of the Bribery Act.

IV. On or about 13th January 2016, during the same time, place and

during the same transaction for accepting a gratification in a sum

of Rs.30,000/- from Muthu Bandage Jagath Disanayake, thereby

Bribery Act.

After trial, the accused-appellant was found guilty by the Judgment dated

15.01.2021 for the four counts and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment

extending to 5 years and a fine of Rs. 5000/- which carries a default

Page 4 of 9

sentence of one-year rigorous imprisonment on each count. This appeal is

preferred against the said convictions and sentences.

Prior to the hearing, written submissions were filed on behalf of both

parties. At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for

the appellant and the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the respondent

made oral submissions.

The following is a summary of the facts relating to the prosecution case:

The appellant was a Divisional Development Officer in Ranorawa branch

of the Department of Agrarian Services. The complainant, PW-1 was a

contractor and the president of Vimukthi Farmer Organization in

Ranorawa area. PW-1, through the said organization, had undertaken to

complete two contracts for the removal of soil from Maha Aliyawidda tank

in Ranorawa. He had completed the two contracts and for the 2nd contract,

got a cheque worth of Rs.466,490/- issued by the Department of Agrarian

Service. PW-1 had given a phone call to the appellant and informed the

necessity to get the approval of the appellant to encash the said cheque as

he was the relevant authorized officer for the said official duty. According

to the prosecution, for the purpose of giving his approval to the cheque to

realize it from the Bank of Ceylon, the appellant had solicited a sum of

Rs. 30,000/- from PW-1 as an inducement and accepted the same as a

gratification.

Thereafter, PW-1 had lodged a complaint to the Commission to Investigate

Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

CIABOC). Investigation Officers of the CIABOC organized a raid and

arrested the appellant when he accepted the bribe of Rs.30,000/-.

At the hearing of the appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for the

appellant confined his arguments to the following two grounds.

Page 5 of 9

i. The prosecution has not proved the charges beyond a reasonable

doubt.

ii. The defence case and the matters raised by the accused-

appellant were not considered by the learned Trial Judge.

The accused-appellant has given evidence in this case and called witnesses

on his behalf. The appellant has admitted the acceptance of Rs. 30,000/-

from the complainant. The appellants position is that the said

Rs. 30,000/- is consisted of a return of a loan of Rs. 15,000/- given by

him to the complainant as well as a part of a sum of 1% of the total cost

of the project which had to be given to the Agrarian Service Committee in

respect of a previous contract as well as this contract.

Evidence clearly shows that in the contract relating to this case, the

contractor is entitled to 95% of the amount due. 5% should be deposited

in the Vimukthi Farmer Organization, the society that had been awarded

the contract, and 1% should be given to the Agrarian Service Committee

from the said 5%.

The position taken up by the appellant was that he asks the complainant

to pay a part of the said 1% in respect of this contract as well as the

previous contract and a Rs. 15,000/- loan that the complainant obtained

from the accused-appellant. The learned Presidents Counsel contended

that the learned High Court Judge has failed to analyze properly the

evidence of the case and there is a factual misdirection which affects the

findings of the learned Judge regarding the rejection of the defence

evidence.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the respondent

contended that the appellant demanded Rs. 30,000/- from the

complainant to give the approval to encash the cheque received from the

Page 6 of 9

Vimukthi Farmer Organization. He further contended that although the

Agrarian Service Committee is entitled for 1% of the amount from the 5%

retained, the appellant cannot demand the complainant to pay the said

1% separately.

In this appeal, the only issue to be determined is straightforward and

simple because soliciting and acceptance of Rs. 30,000/- were admitted

by the appellant. The only matter to be decided is that whether the said

Rs. 30,000/- had been solicited and accepted by the appellant as a

gratification or as part of the 1% due from the contracts and the purported

loan obtained by the complainant from the appellant.

When the complainant was cross-examined by the Defence Counsel, the

aforesaid defence position has been suggested to him. It has been

suggested that the said Rs. 30,000/- was consisted of a part of 1% from

the two contracts and the Rs. 15,000/- loan obtained from the appellant.

The complainant denied the suggestion. In giving evidence, the accused-

appellant has taken up the same position and stated that he gave

Rs. 15,000/- loan to the complainant and he asked the complainant to

pay the said Rs. 15,000/- and part of the said 1%.

There is no receipt or whatever document to show that he gave a loan. In

addition, the appellant has not stated the date or a period of time that he

gave the loan, the place where he gave the loan. Apart from just stating

that he gave Rs. 15,000/- loan to the complainant, there is no any detail

regarding the loan that the appellant had purportedly given to the

complainant. In these circumstances, I agree with the learned High Court

Judge that the story of Rs.15,000/- loan given to the complainant is not

believable. It appears to be a fabricated story to justify the money that was

taken. Even if the said Rs.15,000/- is added to the 1% due from the said

two contracts, it will not be Rs. 30,000/-.

Page 7 of 9

The appellant says that he took a part of the 1% and the Rs.15,000/-. If

the appellant asked the amount of Rs.30.000/- to recover the 1% due to

the Agrarian Service Committee and to get back the purported loan given

by him, why he demanded and accepted only a part of the 1%? This is

indeed unusual and unacceptable defence. According to the evidence of

the case, there was no procedure to demand and accept separately the

said 1% from the due amount. The said 1% should be given by the society

to the Agrarian Service Committee from the 5% that the society retained.

Anyhow, it is amply clear that there is absolutely no way to recover only a

part payment from the 1%.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant pointed out that there

were instances where the said 1% was not paid by the society to the

Agrarian Service Committee although the said Committee is entitled to it.

In the transaction pertaining to this case, it has not been transpired from

the evidence that there was a necessity to recover this 1% separately from

the complainant. In addition, there was no such procedure to recover the

1% separately from the complainant as stated previously.

If the appellant collected a part payment of the 1% as he stated although

there was no such way to collect the same, undisputedly, a receipt must

be issued. As a reason for not issuing a receipt for the part of the 1%

charged, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant stated that

there was no time to issue a receipt because the appellant was arrested

before issuing the receipt. In reply, the learned DSG contended that

according to the evidence presented, the complainant came out from the

office after giving Rs. 30,000/- to the appellant and if the appellant wanted

to issue a receipt, he could have told the complainant to remain in the

office until the receipt is issued. Therefore, the learned DSG contended

that the story of arresting him before issuing the receipt is false. It is

Page 8 of 9

apparent from the document P-3 that the appellant had given the approval

to encash the cheque after receiving the Rs. 30,000/-. Even the appellant

stated in his evidence that he endorsed the approval in P-3. If money is

taken from a person in performing an official duty, the first thing that the

officer should do is to issue a receipt for the money taken. After issuing a

receipt for the money that the complainant gave, the appellant should have

given the approval. The appellant did not issue a receipt but did give his

approval. Therefore, I agree with the contention of the learned DSG that it

is apparent that the appellant had time to issue a receipt before the arrest

if he wanted to issue a receipt but he did not. Not issuing a receipt is also

a reason to conclude that Rs.30,000/- was taken not as a part of 1% and

the loan but as a bribe.

In considering the aforesaid circumstances, the only conclusion that could

be arrived is that the accused-appellant had taken the Rs. 30,000/- as a

gratification and not as a part payment of 1% and loan given to

complainant by him. Therefore, it is my view that the four charges leveled

against the accused-appellant have been proved beyond a reasonable

doubt.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant pointed out page 18 of

the impugned Judgment and contended that the learned Trial Judge has

come to a conclusion that the defence version cannot be believed because

the evidence of PW-1 is highly credible and that it is entirely a wrong

analysis of evidence. I agree with the said contention of the learned

Presidents Counsel. However, for the reasons stated in this Judgment, I

hold that the conclusion of the learned High Court Judge to reject the

defence version is correct. In addition, the conclusion of the learned Judge

that the four charges against the accused-appellant have been proved

beyond a reasonable doubt is also correct. The sentences imposed by the

learned Trial Judge are also lawful and correct in principle.

Page 9 of 9

Accordingly, the Judgment dated 15.01.2021, the convictions and the

sentences imposed on the accused-appellant are affirmed.

The appeal is dismissed.
