After trial, the appellant was found guilty for both the counts preferred against

her of the judgement dated 13-01-2021 by the learned High Court Judge of

Balapitiya. Accordingly, she has been sentenced to life imprisonment on both

the counts.

Being aggrieved of her conviction and the sentence, the appellant preferred this

appeal.

Facts in Brief

This was a detection made by the police officers of the Vice Prevention Unit of

Elpitiya Senior Superintendent of Police Division.

PW-01 mentioned in the list of witnesses who was the Officer-in-Charge of the

team that made the detection was deceased at the time this matter was taken

up for trial. Hence, the prosecution has relied on the evidence of PW-02 and that

of PW-04 who accompanied and assisted the PW-01 in the detection to establish

the charges against the appellant.

PW-02, Sub Inspector Premalal had been serving as PS19884 in the said Vice

Prevention Unit headed by PW-01, PS5736 Perera, during the time relevant to

this incident. On 23-08-2000, a police team led by Sergeant Perera that

comprised of PW-02 and PW-04 has left the Elpitiya police station on routine

vice prevention duty. They have arrested 5 suspects by the time the detection in

relation to this case has been made. All of them had been arrested for possessing

illicit liquor, and they had been under the custody of the police.

Around 12.45 in the afternoon, the team has come near Ahungalle railway

station and had been searching a thicket behind the railway station on a tip off

about hidden illicit liquor in the area. Near the area where they were searching,

there was a road that runs towards nearby houses. While they were searching

the thicket, a female has gone past them walking towards the main road. As the

Officer-in-Charge of the police team has observed that the female was walking

Page 4 of 13

suspiciously, he along with PW-02 and a female police officer who was with them,

namely, WPC2686, have gone and apprehended the female.

They have observed that she was holding on to something in her right-hand

palm. When Sergeant Perera directed her to show her palm, she has been very

reluctant, but when forced, she has opened her palm. They have observed that

she is having a camera reel container. (

) When the lid was opened by Sergeant Perera, the witness has observed a

brown-coloured powder in a small pink coloured bag inside the container. When

inspected, the witness has identified the content as Heroin through his

experience. The witness has identified the female who was detected with the

substance as the appellant.

Accordingly, she has been arrested, and the plastic container and the content

had been temporarily sealed, and taken to a shop called Beruwala Gem Bureau

where the brown-coloured powder detected has been weighed using the

electronic scale available in the said shop. The contents had shown a gross

weight of 8 grams and 404 milligrams. After the weighing, the contents had been

sealed again and the appellant, together with the productions detected had been

produced to Kosgoda police station.

The witness has identified the productions recovered from the custody of the

appellant at the trial.

The stand taken up by the appellant during the trial had been that the container

which had Heroin was recovered by the police party in the thicket they were

searching, and they came looking for drugs as a result of a petition received by

them. It had been the position of the appellant that after the discovery of the

container with Heroin, the police party came to the house of the appellant, which

was nearby, and arrested the appellant implicating her falsely for the detection.

The witness has denied that the appellant was arrested in the manner suggested

by the learned Counsel for the appellant and had insisted that the police party

Page 5 of 13

had no reasons to arrest the appellant falsely, and she was arrested only because

she had Heroin in her possession.

PW-04 had been another officer who was in the police party and assisted

Sergeant Perera in the detection. He has substantiated the evidence given by PW-

02 in that regard, and had stated that when the appellant was arrested, she had

in her right-hand palm the container which had the quantity of Heroin. In his

evidence, he has stated that when the appellant was stopped and searched,

Sergeant Perera was assisted by WPC2686 Sandya who was a member of the

raiding party. PW-04 also has identified the relevant productions in Court.

According to the evidence of PW-02, when the appellant was arrested, he has

come to know that the appellant was living in the vicinity, because of the fact

that some females from a house located nearby came to the place of the arrest.

However, the evidence of PW-04 had been that he was unaware where the

appellant was living. It has been suggested to PW-04 that the police party never

went to a place called Beruwala Gem Bureau for the weighing of the productions.

However, the witness had denied that suggestion insisting that it was weighed

as stated in the evidence.

During the trial, the appellant has admitted the report prepared by the

Government Analyst in relation to the productions sent to the Government

Analyst for analysis, and the fact that the report contained that the pure quantity

of Heroin found was 3.21 grams. The appellant also had admitted the production

chain. Accordingly, the said admissions had been recorded in terms of section

420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

After the prosecution case was closed, having considered the evidence led against

the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has decided to call for a defence

from her.

The appellant has made a dock statement. In her dock statement she has taken

up the stand that on the date of the incident, she went to her mothers house

Page 6 of 13

and while there, some persons came to the house and called her. When she came

out, they identified themselves as police officers and said that they found some

drugs in the thicket nearby and arrested her and took her to the Kosgoda police

station. She has denied that she had anything in her possession and had claimed

innocence of the charge.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the Court.

1. There were inter se contradictions between the evidence of PW-02 and

04, and the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider them as

relevant.

2. WPC2686 Sandya who was a member of the police party had not been

called as a witness, and that creates a doubt as to the prosecution

evidence.

3. The probability of the alleged incident as narrated by the witnesses.

4. The learned High Court Judge was misdirected as to the alleged place

of arrest.

5. The learned High Court Judge who heard the case remanded the

appellant during the trial because she could not bring her Counsel to

Court, and she was granted bail only under the directive of the Court

of Appeal, which has resulted in a denial of a fair trial towards the

appellant.

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

As the grounds of appeal number 1 to 4 are interrelated, I will now proceed to

consider them collectively.

However, before considering the said grounds of appeal, I find it appropriate to

consider the 5th ground of appeal, where it is alleged that no fair trial was

afforded to the appellant as a result of her being remanded during the trial.

Page 7 of 13

I find that the trial of this matter has been commenced on 21-09-2017 and the

evidence in chief of PW-02 had been concluded on that day.

Rather than cross-examining the witness, the learned Counsel for the appellant

has moved for a date for cross-examination of the witness, which has resulted

in the case being postponed to 13-03-2018. However, it is apparent from the case

record that the case has gone down several occasions, mainly on applications

made on behalf of the appellant, and various Counsel had appeared for her at

various times.

The learned High Court Judge, being frustrated of the case being dragged on in

this manner has decided to remand the appellant on 01-10-2019 and take the

matter forward. Still, the matter could not be taken up for further trial until 29-

06-2020.

During the intervening period, the appellant has filed an application in revision

before the Court of Appeal, challenging the learned High Court Judges decision

to remand her, and upon a directive from the Court of Appeal, the appellant has

been released on the same bail conditions imposed upon her earlier.

The above factual situation clearly provides that although the appellant has been

remanded during the pendency of her case, since there was no evidence led

during that period, there was no denial of fair trial towards her. Therefore, I am

in no position to agree that no fair trial was afforded to her, and do not find merit

in the 5th ground of appeal urged by the appellant.

The alleged inter se contradiction the learned Counsel speaks about relates to

whether the witnesses knew beforehand the house where the appellant lived. I

am unable to find any contradiction in that regard as it is clear that both

witnesses have stated the same.

The evidence of the PW-02 had been that neither he nor any other officer who

took part in the detection knew where the appellant lived, but assumed that she

is living nearby as several persons came out of a house nearby when they

Page 8 of 13

arrested the appellant. However, he has given evidence that he knew the area

well, being an experienced police officer.

The evidence of PW-04 had been the same, the only difference being that he has

not explained any further as to how he assumed where the house of the appellant

situated. Probably, because, such a question was not put to the witness by the

Counsel who represented the appellant at the trial.

I am unable to find any discrepancy as to the place of arrest as well. The

prosecution evidence has been that the appellant was arrested while she was

walking suspiciously on the nearby road from the place where the police officers

were looking for hidden illicit liquor. The evidence of the prosecution witnesses

had been consistent as to the place of arrest,

I find no basis to conclude that the position taken up by the appellant has

created any doubt as to the place of arrest.

For the reasons considered as above, I find no basis for the 1st and the 4th

grounds of appeal.

I will now proceed to consider whether the defence taken up by the appellant has

created any doubt as to the prosecution case when the ground of appeal in

relation to the probability is considered.

It is trite law that the evidence in a case should be considered in its totality and

not in its isolation.

In the Privy Council judgement in Jayasena Vs. Queen 72 NLR 313, it was held:

A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to consider

all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the prosecution or by

the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing and, ask himself

whether a prudent man, in the circumstances of the particular case, he

believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty.

Page 9 of 13

The learned Counsel for the appellant contended that the failure of the

prosecution to call WPC2686 Sandya who has taken part in the raid as a major

drawback for the prosecutions case. He was of the view that it has created a

presumption in terms of section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance that, if called,

her evidence would have been contrary to the evidence of the other witnesses as

to what really happened. It was his position that this fact in itself creates a

reasonable doubt as to the prosecution case.

The view of the learned SSC in this regard was that the prosecution has called

the necessary witnesses to prove its case and it is not necessary to call all the

witnesses listed in an indictment to prove a case against an accused.

He cited the case of Devundarage Nihal Vs. A.G., S.C. Appeal 154/2010

decided on 03-01-2019 in support of his contention.

The relevant section 134 of the Evidence Ordinance reads thus;

134. No particular number of witnesses shall in any case be required

to the proof of any fact.

Considering the relevant section 134 of the Indian Evidence Act which is

identical to that of section 134 of our Ordinance, Buwaneka Aluvihare, J. in the

case of Devundarage Nihal Vs. A.G. (supra) cited the Indian case of Vadivelu

Thewar Vs. State of Madras SIR SC 614 where the Indian Supreme Court

observed,

On consideration of the relevant authorities and the provisions of the Indian

Evidence Act 1872, the following propositions may be safely stated as firmly

established.

1. As a general rule, a Court can and may act on the testimony of a

single witness though uncorroborated. One credible witness

outweighs the testimony of a number of other witnesses of

indifferent character.

Page 10 of 13

2. Unless corroboration is insisted upon by statute, Court should not

insist on corroboration, except in cases where the nature of the

testimony of the single witness itself requires as a rule of

prudence,

3. Whether corroboration of the testimony of a single witness is or is

not necessary, must depend upon the facts and circumstances of

each case and no general rule can be laid down in a matter like

this and much depends upon the judicial discretion of the Judge

before whom the case comes.

In the case of King Vs Chalo Singho 42 NLR 269, Soertsz, J. stated,

It must, therefore, be regarded as well-established law, that a prosecutor

is not bound to call all the witnesses on the indictment or to tender them for

cross-examination. That is a matter in his discretion. But in exceptional

circumstances, a Judge might interfere to ask him to call a witness or to call

a witness as a witness of the Court.

In Walimunige John Vs. The State 76 NLR 488, it was held,

The prosecution is not bound to call all the witnesses whose names appear

on the back of the indictment or to tender them for cross-examination.

Further, it is not incumbent on the trial Judge to direct the jury, save in

exceptional circumstances, that they may draw a presumption under section

114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance adverse to the prosecution from its failure

to call one or more of its witnesses at the trial without calling all.

The question of a presumption arises only where a witness whose evidence

is necessary to unfold the narrative withheld by the prosecution and the

failure to call such witness constitutes a vital missing link in the prosecution

case and where the reasonable inference to be drawn from the omission to

call the witness is that he would, if called, not have supported the

prosecution. But where one witnesses evidence is cumulative of the other

and would be a mere repetition of the narrative, it would be wrong to direct

Page 11 of 13

a jury that the failure to call such witness give rise to a presumption under

section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance.

In the appeal under consideration, it is not that the prosecution has called a

single witness to prove their case. Two police officers who took part in the raid

has been called by the prosecution. The mentioned WPC2686 Sandya is not a

listed witness in the indictment. It is clear from the evidence of the witnesses

that her contribution to the actual detection was very minimal. When Sergeant

Perera wanted the appellant to open her palm and show what she was carrying,

initially she has hesitated, it had been the evidence of the witnesses that it was

with reluctance that the appellant agreed to open the palm.

According to the evidence of PW-04, WPC Sandya has assisted Sergeant Perera

to persuade the appellant to open her palm. Subsequent to the discovery of the

reel container, WPC Sandya has searched the appellant which was an action

done after the actual detection was made.

As I have considered before, her evidence does not constitute a missing link in

the evidence of the prosecution. I find no basis to conclude that not calling WPC

Sandya amounts to creating a suspicion as to the detection made by the police.

I am of the view that the probability of an incident as narrated by witnesses has

to be considered by taking the evidence, be it of the prosecution or the defence,

in its totality, and not by taking portions of evidence in its isolation.

When considering the evidence of the prosecution as a whole, it is clear that they

have gone near the place where the detection was made to look for hidden illicit

liquor in a thicket behind the railway station. Although they were in civics, the

fact that they were police officers may have been visible to any onlookers because

of what they were doing at that time. Under such circumstances, the police

officers being trained and experienced officers in observing people, it was very

much possible for witnesses to suspect the appellant in the way she is alleged to

have behaved when passing the police officers who were looking for illicit liquor.

Page 12 of 13

I find that it was quite probable for the witnesses led by Sergeant Perera to

pursue the appellant, stop her, and search her. According to the witnesses, when

they stopped her, they have observed that she was holding something in her

right-hand palm. Upon inspection, it has been found that she is having a film

roll container, which was something commonly available during that period as

digital camera technology was rare at that time. Such a container is something

that a person can easily hold in the hand.

The gross quantity of the substance found inside the container was 8.404 grams.

Although such a quantity may sound small nowadays, in the year 2000, this

would amount to a relatively large quantity of a dangerous drug.

The evidence of the witnesses as to the place of residence of the appellant is very

much probable as against the contention of the appellant, where she states that

police officers came to her house and arrested her after finding the drug hidden

in the thicket.

I do not see any probability in the version of events taken up by the appellant,

as I do not find any reason for a drug trafficker to hide a drug in a thicket after

putting it in a small container. I do not find any reason for the police party to

accuse the appellant if she was innocently inside her mothers house when the

detection took place on the road.

I do not find any basis to conclude that the police party went to the appellants

house based on a petition received by them. The evidence led in the case does

not suggest any basis to believe that receiving a petition was the reason for this

raid. The evidence has clearly established that the detection had been while the

police officers were engaged in vice prevention duties, and not having conducted

a planned raid in relation to the appellant.

For the reasons as considered above, I am of the view that the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses was quite probable, cogent and trustworthy.

Page 13 of 13

The defence taken up by the appellant has not created any doubt as to the

evidence of the prosecution.

Therefore, for the reasons considered as above, I find no merit in the grounds of

appeal urged on behalf of the appellant.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the

sentence affirmed.
