a) Issue notice of this application on all the Respondents;

b) For an order in the nature of writ of Mandamus directing 1st, 2nd and 5th

Respondents to entertain and process the application of the 1st Petitioner

for approval of Plan No. 3287 made by A.M Jayapala Licensed Surveyor

on 29/02/2020.

c) For an order in the natire of writ of Mandamus directing the 1st. 2nd and

5th Respondents to accept from the 1st Petitioner the rates in respect of the

premises referred to in the documents marked P-9 (a) and P-10 and to

issue a receipt therefore to the Petitioner.

d) Order for costs;

e) Order such other and further reliefs that Your Lordships Court shall seem

meet.

The facts of this matter briefly are as follows,

According to the Petition, the 2nd Petitioner was occupying the land depicted in

the said Plan No 3287 from year 2006. Furthermore, the 2nd Petitioner had

developed, cultivated and possessed this said land for a period of 14 years

without any disturbance or interruption from any person. Therefore, the 2nd

Petitioner had executed a Deed of Declaration bearing No. 231 dated 14/03/2020.

Thereafter, the 2nd Petitioner had gifted the said land to the 1st Petitioner by

virtue of a Deed of Gift bearing No 292 dated 23/04/2021 and now the 1st

Petitioner is the legal owner of the said land.

The 1st petitioner made an application to the AttanagallaPradeshiyaSabha

seeking approval for the said Plan No. 3287 on 29/09/2022. The Petitioners state

that as per the instructions of the AttanagallaPradeshiyaSabha the 2nd

Petitioner had paid Rs 1000/- on behalf of the 1st Petitioner on 22/09/2022 to the

AttanagallaPradeshiyaSabha in respect of two applications, namely; Surveyor

Plan approval application and Building Plan approval application. According to

the petitioner, the 2nd Respondent have informed the Petitioner to bring extracts

with respect to the Lot 39A depicted in Plan No 3287 from the Land Registry of

Attanagalla. According to the document marked P7 they have handed over the

said extracts, somewhere in November 2022. According to the Petitioner,

Page 4 of 6

Divisional Secretary of Attanagalla has informed the Land Registrar that the

Land which is subjected to the Deed of Declaration bearing No 231 depicted in

the said surveyor plan No. 3287 is not a State Land, but it is a private land.

The main argument put forward by the Petitioners are that the Respondents

have the statutory duty to approve the plan which was submitted by the

Petitioner and accept the rates in respect of the premises referred in the said

plan.

We are mindful that the Petitioners are claiming the premises on the basis that

they have derived the title on the basis of prescription.

When we perused both the Deeds. Deed bearing No 231 was executed on

14.03.2020, other deed where the 1st Petitioner title bearing No 292 was executed

on 23.04.2021. Both the Deeds were recently executed. For that purpose, the 1st

Respondent had asked from the Petitioners to submit the relevant documents

that pertaining to the said Deeds from the Land Registry to approve the said

plan. We are mindful that the particular plan which was marked as P1 doesnt

indicate the name of the owner of the Land and there is no Assessment Number

given to the land.

One of the objection taken by the Respondent is that, since the 2nd Petitioner

claimed his title over the said land on prescription which was recently executed

by deed, they are not certain whether any other person will claim the ownership

of the said land. To avoid the future dispute over the said land the Respondents

needed more time to ascertain and confirm the ownership of the said land, which

is depicted in the said plan. Further they stated that the particular plan does not

have any reference whatsoever regarding the owner of the said land.

According to the Respondents, Urban Development Authority Law has power to

approve the sub division of the land which is coming under a development

activity. That means, whenever any person submit the plan for building, the

survey plan submitted by them should be approved in accordance with the rules

therefore they need more time to confirm it.

Furthermore, the have indicated that for the assessment, to give a new

assesmmt for the said they need to get a report from the chief valuver. According

to section 140 (1) of the PradeshiyaSabhas Act No. 15 of 1987,

140. (1) For the preparation of a new assessment, the annual value of each

house, building land and tenement within the limits of any PradeshiyaSabha

shall be assested by the Chief Valuer or any person or persons appointed by the

PradeshiyaSabha with the approval of the Assistant Commissioner

According to the above section, the particular land has to be assessed by the

Chief valuver with the approval of the Assistant Commissioner. Therefore it take

some time to conclude the inquiry.

Therefore, they alleged that, within months without waiting to the approval, the

Petitioners have invoked thisCourts Jurisdiction toobtain a Writ of Mandamus

to approve the plan.

Concept of Mandamus was discussed by Professor Wade & C F Forsyth in their

Book on Administrative Law, 11th edition, at page 520.

Nature of this Remedy

"The prerogative remedy of a mandatory order has long provided the normal

means of enforcing the performance of public duties by public authorities of all

kinds. Like the other prerogative remedies, it is normally granted on the

application of a private litigant, though it may equally well be used by one public

authority against another. The commonest employment of a mandatory order is

as a weapon in the hands of the ordinary citizen, when a public authority fails to

do its duty by him. The quashing order and a prohibiting order deal with

wrongful action, a mandatory order deals with wrongful inaction. The

prerogative remedies thus together cover the field of governmental powers and

duties."

One of the prerequisites to the mandamus is that the Petitioner has to show that

the respondent refused to exercise his duties. In the instant case, the Petitioner s

Page 6 of 6

have failed to establish that the Respondents havenot taken any steps to perform

their duties. On the other hand, the Petitioners own documents shows that the

Respondents have requested the Petitioners to submit relevant documents for

them to consider the approving of the plan.

We are mindful of the words stated by Sharvananda J (as he was then) in

Ratnayaka and Others v. C.D. Perera and Others, 1982 (2) SLR 451 at page 456.

The general rule of Mandamus is that its function is to compel a public

authority to do its duty. The essence of Mandamus is that it is a command issued

by the superior Court for the performance of public legal duty. Where officials

have a public duty to perform and have refused to perform, Mandamus will lie to

secure the performance of the public duty, in the performance of which the

applicant has sufficient legal interest. It is only granted to compel the

performance of duties of a public nature, and not merely of private character that

is to say for the enforcement of a mere private right. (Emphasis added).

For the above said reasons we hold that this is a premature application as still

the Respondents are considering to approve the said plan. For the above said

reasons we dismiss the application with costs.

We direct the Respondents to conclude the said inquiry with regarding to the

approving of the plan and if the Petitioners are not satisfied, they have the

liberty to agitate this matter in this Court.
