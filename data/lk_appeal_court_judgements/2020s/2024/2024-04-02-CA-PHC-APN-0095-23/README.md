JUDGMENT

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Accused-Appellant-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) was indicted before the Provincial High Court of Embilipitiya

by the Hon. Attorney General for one count of kidnapping the victim

Balakrishnan Niroshani from lawful guardianship punishable under

Section 354 of the Penal Code and two counts of rape charge

punishable under Section 364(2) to be read with Section 364(2)(e) of the

Penal Code.

When the indictment was read over to the Petitioner, he had pleaded

guilty to the charges and was convicted on his own plea. After the

sentencing submissions of both parties the Learned High Court Judge

of Embilipitiya on 26.09.2022 sentenced the Petitioner as follows:

1. 1st Count- 2 years Rigorous imprisonment with a fine of

Rs.5000/. In default 12 months Simple Imprisonment.

2. 2nd Count- 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment with a fine of

Rs.10,000/-. In default 12 months Simple Imprisonment.

3. 2nd Count- 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment with a fine of

10,000/-. In default 12 months Simple Imprisonment.

In addition, the Petitioner was ordered to pay a compensation of

Rs.350,000/- with a default sentence of 12 months Simple

Imprisonment. The Court further ordered that the sentence imposed on

2nd and 3rd charges to run concurrently.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the Learned High Court

Judge of Embilipitiya, the Petitioner filed this revision application before

this Court.

It is well settled law that when an application for revision is filed the

Petitioner has to satisfy the court that there are exceptional

circumstances which shocks the consciousness of the court in the

impugned judgment.

According to the Section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No.15 of 1979, there are three aspects which a court could consider in

a revisionary proceeding have been considered. They are;

1. Legality of any order,

2. Propriety of any sentence or order and

3. Regularity of the proceedings of such court.

In Hotel Galaxy Ltd & others v Mercantile Hotel Management

Ltd (1987) 1 SLR 5 Sharvananda C.J. reiterated that:

it is settled law that the exercise of revisionary powers of the

Appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional

circumstances exist warranting its intervention

The Petitioner has pleaded following exceptional circumstances in

support of her Revision Application.

1. The Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya has erred in law by

not considering the fact that the Petitioner was a teenager at the

time of commission of the offence.

2. The Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya erred in law by not

appreciating the fact that the Petitioner is a first-time offender

and pleaded guilty at the 1st instant without going for trial.

3. The Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya had failed to

consider that the Petitioner has no previous conviction or pending

case when imposing the sentence.

CA PHC APN 95-2023

4. The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider that the

Petitioner in an uneducated and less understanding of gravity

and the consequence of the offence committed by him.

5. The Learned High Court Judge was influenced by the submission

of the State Counsel on a hypothetical and imaginative

submission that the accused wouldnt have been pleaded guilty

if the DNA report is not available which rendered the Learned

High Court Judge to make such excessive sentence to the

Petitioner where the context is completely unlawful

6. The Learned High Court Judge failed appreciated the fact that the

statement made to the victim to the police itself a good proof to

the fact that there was a consent through it is not relevant since

the victim is a under the age of 16, but the Learned High Court

Judge has come to a conclusion that there was no consent which

fact had been influenced the Learned High Court Judge to impose

an excessive sentence.

Our Courts have repeatedly held that the revisionary power of Courts is

an extraordinary power and that the Courts must exercise it only in

exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances are not defined

in the statute. Hence, what is exceptional circumstances must be

considered on its own facts and circumstances on a case by case.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

As the exceptional circumstances urged before this Court by the

Petitioner are interrelated, all grounds will be considered together in

this case.

CA PHC APN 95-2023

The Counsel for the Petitioner mainly argued that the victim and the

Petitioner have come to a good understanding and love affair as it was

and, now victim and the Petitioner are willing to get married and live

together with their child who is four years old. The victim has given an

affidavit to that effect and marked as X5 to this application.

The victim in this case was only 13 years old when she encountered

this bitter ordeal. According to the statement of the victim, she was

forcibly raped by the Petitioner sans any consent.

The victim was become pregnant at the age of 13 years and became a

child mother at an early age, without having any guardian after

delivering her baby. She also lost her education and was in the Visaka

Childrens Home with her baby. She had remained in the said home

with her baby until she become 17 years. The victim was produced from

the Embilipitiya National Childrens Home when the High Court case

was taken up on 26.09.2022. At that time, she was 17 years and 10

months old.

As correctly pointed out by the Learned Deputy Solicitor General who

represented the Attorney General, the proceedings of the High Court do

not indicate that the Petitioner expressed any desire that he wish to

marry the victim who was 17 years and 10 months old and extended

interest in supporting his child who was born to the victim in any

manner despite the DNA Report establishing that the Petitioner was the

biological father of the child.

Further, when the victim and the child were living in childrens homes,

there was no action taken by the Petitioner or his family to support and

care for them prior to his sentence being imposed on the Petitioner.

These matters had been quite correctly considered by the Learned High

Court Judge at the time of sentencing.

CA PHC APN 95-2023

7 | P a g e

The Petitioner showed no remorse at the High Court stage, and his

application to marry the victim at this stage, clearly shows his after

thought to escape from the sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge.

Considering all the materials placed before this Court, I see no reason

to disturb the findings of the Learned High Court Judge of Embilipitiya.

But considering the present circumstances of the case, I order the

sentence imposed on the 1st count also to run concurrent to the

sentence imposed on 2nd and 3rd counts. Accordingly, the Petitioner will

have to serve 10 years rigorous imprisonment from the date of

conviction namely, 26.09.2022. Subject to above variation in the

sentence, this revision application is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Embilipitiya.
