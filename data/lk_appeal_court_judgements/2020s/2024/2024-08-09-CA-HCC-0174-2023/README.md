JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Sections 54(A) (b) and 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for

Trafficking and Possession of 123.67 grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on

18.06. 2013.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty on both counts and the Learned

High Court Judge of Colombo had imposed a sentence of life imprisonment

on both counts on 04/05/2023.

CA/HCC/174/23

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the hearing,

the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Learned High Court Judge had failed to evaluate the evidence of PW1

and PW8 and there by failed to take into consideration that the

evidence of PW1 and PW8 fails the tests of credibility and probability.

2. Learned High Court Judge had rejected the defence evidence on

unreasonable grounds.

In this case the raid was conducted based on information received. The raid

was headed by PW1 with 19 male Special Task Police Officers from the

Colombo Head Quarters. All have been named as witnesses in the indictment

including the Government Analyst. The prosecution had called PW1, PW8,

PW19, and PW22 and marked productions P1 to P37 in support of their case.

Handing over the productions to the reserve police officer, taking the

productions to the Court and handing over the productions to the

Government Analyst were admitted under Section 420 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

When the defence was called, the Appellant gave evidence from witness box,

called one witness on his behalf, and closed the defence case.

Background of the case.

According to PW1 IP/Kulasekera attached to Special Task Force of the

Colombo Head Quarters, upon an information, they had organized a raid to

apprehend a person carrying Heroin. According to the information received

by PW8 SI/Roshan from his personal informer, that the said person was

enroute to Maliban Junction. PW8 had received the information in the

CA/HCC/174/23

4 | P a g e

morning and the raiding party had left the Colombo STF Head Quarters

around 11:15 hours. PW1 and three other STF personnel had proceeded to

Maliban Junction in a car while other STF officers who travelled in a Cab

were stationed near the Dehiwala Overhead Bridge. According to PW1, the

informant had given the description of the person and he was arrested at

12:30 hours at Maliban Junction.

The same informant had furnished further information regarding another

person trafficking Heroin in a three-wheeler bearing No. WPYU-0372 who

was expected near the Kaduwela Bus Stand. While the STF Officers waited

near Kaduwela Bus Stand till 15:30 hours, such a three-wheeler was not

observed thereabouts.

At that time the informer renewing his information, called PW8 and informed

that the person is expected near Millenium Food Centre situated along

Piliyandala Road, Maharagama around 17:30 hours. PW1 and PW8 waited

in the car which was parked near the Food Centre. At about 17:30 hours the

Appellant had arrived in the three-wheeler numbered WPYU-0372 and

inadvertently parked it facing the car in which the STF personnel were

stationed.

When the Appellant was searched, two parcels with some substances were

found to be in his left and right-side trouser pockets. Rs.65000/- in cash

and a purse were also recovered from the Appellant. Upon searching the

three-wheeler, another parcel with some substance, a digital scale and two

live bullets were found in a secret chamber behind the rear seat. As the

substances in the parcel recovered from the Appellant reacted for Heroin

(diacetylmorphine) he was arrested at 17:30 hours by PW1.

Upon further information provided by the informer, the STF officers had

checked a grocery shop nearby and a digital scale was recovered from under

a table. The owner, namely Dilummika, was also arrested at 17:50 hours.

Thereafter, the STF officers had gone to the Police Narcotics Bureau at 20:15

CA/HCC/174/23

5 | P a g e

hours, sealed the productions, entered the same under PR No. 115/2013 to

120/2013 and handed over the Appellant, Dilummika and the productions

to PW19 at 23:45 hours.

Thereafter, PW8 was called to give evidence to corroborate the evidence of

PW1 and it was followed by the evidence of the Government Analyst and

PW19.

The burden of proof usually lies upon the person who brings a claim in a

dispute. It is often associated with the Latin maxim semper necessitas

probandi incumbit ei qui agit, a translation of which is: "the necessity of proof

always lies with the person who lays charges." Hence an accused person has

no burden to prove his case except where he pleads a general or a special

exception in the Penal Code, where he will then be required to bring evidence

to prove the defence.

Therefore, a person can only be convicted based on cogent and unambiguous

evidence as that 'presumption of innocence' is the hallmark and glory of our

system of criminal justice.

Further, in a drug related prosecution, the evidence adduced by both the

prosecution and the defence should be considered very carefully to avoid

anybody taking undue advantage. Establishment of high degree of

probability is an indispensable requirement in all drug related prosecutions.

Probability holds a very important role when it comes to convincing the judge

on a specific point as more probable one of the two or more possibilities are,

where then there will be a better chance for the judge to get convinced.

Probability is of utmost importance during criminal investigation and is used

to assess the significance of various types of evidence. To accuse

someone beyond reasonable doubt it becomes quintessential to have

strong evidence and for the sake of that one has to make few assumptions

to reach certain conclusions, the possibility of these assumptions to be true

is specifically know as principle of probability in legal terms.

CA/HCC/174/23

6 | P a g e

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellant are inter-related, the grounds

will be considered together in this case.

In this case, police officers had conducted the raid upon an information that

the Appellant was expected at Maliban Junction, Ratmalana. They set off

from the STF Head Quarters and reached Ratmalana in a car and a cab. A

person was arrested there and when they were returning via Attidiya Road,

the informant had given second information to PW8 that the Appellant is

enroute to Kaduwela in a three-wheeler bearing No. WP YU-372. Hence the

team proceeded to Kaduwela. Although they had waited at Kaduwela till

15:30 hours, the three-wheeler did not turn up. At that time PW8 had

received third information that the Appellant is expected near Millenium

Food Centre on the Maharagama-Piliyandala Road. The Cab was stationed

near YMCA Maharagama and PW1 and P8 had proceeded in a car with three

other officers to Millenium Food City. According to PW1 they had arrived at

the Millenium Food Centre at 17:25 hours while PW8 had stated that they

arrived at 14:00 hours. PW1 further contradicted his own evidence saying

that they reached Millenium Food Centre at 16:00 pm. The contradictory

evidence regarding arrival time is given much significance in this case, as

the informer had given three pieces of information. As such the contradictory

evidence given by PW1 and PW8 regarding the arrival time certainly affects

the probability of events which had been heavily relied on by the prosecution.

According to PW1 first they had gone to Maliban Junction in Ratmalana.

From there the police party had gone to Kaduwela and finally they had

arrived at Maharagama. As per the ODO meter of the Cab, it had run 112

Km for the entire operation. Considering the distance between Bauddhaloka

Mawatha to Maliban Junction, Maliban Junction to Kaduwela, Kaduwela to

Maharagama and then from Maharagama to Police Narcotics Bureau, the

distances covered by the cab is excessive. No plausible explanation was

adduced by the prosecution to iron out the excessive mileage. This too raises

CA/HCC/174/23

7 | P a g e

doubts about the probability of the events as described by the prosecution

witnesses.

According to the prosecution, another Heroin parcel, two live 9mm bullets

and a scale were detected from a secret chamber in the rear of the three-

wheeler. The Learned High Court Judge relied heavily on this recovery to

come to arrive at his decision. But the prosecution had failed to produce the

three-wheeler during the trial. The Learned High Court Judge had

considered this evidence in favour of the prosecution merely because of the

failure of the defence to direct questions to the relevant prosecution

witnesses regarding non-production of the three-wheeler. The relevant

portion of the judgment is re-produced below:

The importance of adducing real evidence in a criminal trial is very important

when oral evidence refers to the existence of any material thing. In this case

as stated above a three-wheeler with a secret chamber had been referred to

by the prosecution witnesses, but they had failed to produce the same at the

trial.

CA/HCC/174/23

8 | P a g e

Section 60 of the Evidence ordinance states:

Oral evidence must, in all cases whatever, be direct; that is to say

(1) If it refers to a fact which could be seen it must be the

evidence of a witness who says he saw that fact;

(2) If it refers to a fact which could be heard, it must be the

evidence of a witness who says he heard that fact;

(3) If it refers to a fact which could be perceived by any other

sense or in any other manner, it must be the evidence of a

witness who says he perceived that fact by that sense or in that

manner;

(4) If it refers to an opinion or to the grounds on which that

opinion is held, it must be the evidence of the person who holds

that opinion on those grounds.

Provided that the opinions of experts expressed in any treatise commonly

offered for sale, and the grounds on which such opinions are held, may be

proved by the production of such treatises if the author is dead or cannot be

found, or has become incapable of giving evidence, or cannot be called as a

witness without an amount of delay or expense which the court regards as

unreasonable:

Provided also that, if oral evidence refers to the existence or condition of any

material thing other than a document, the production of such material thing

for its inspection.

CA/HCC/174/23

The importance of presenting a physical object referred to in evidence in a

criminal trial was very extensively discussed in SC Appeal No.155/14

decided on 28.06.2021 by His Lordship Yasantha Kodagoda, PC, J. The

relevant portion of the judgment is re-produced below:

According to the law of Evidence, as of right it would not be possible for a

party to a criminal or civil case to present a physical object as an item of

evidence, on its own standing. This is because it would not come within

any one of the four categories of evidence also referred to as judicial

evidence, recognized by the law of Evidence, namely oral evidence,

documentary evidence, contemporaneous audio-visual recordings and

computer evidence. The latter two categories of evidence, namely

contemporaneous audio-visual recordings and computer evidence

gained recognition in the eyes of the law by the Evidence (Special

Provisions) Act, No. 14 of 1995. What is contemplated by

contemporaneous audio-visual recordings are recordings of the

occurrence of the facts in issue or relevant facts embedded in certain

media, and they can take the form of audio recordings, video recordings,

audio-visual or video recordings, and still photographs. Section 60 of the

Evidence Ordinance which provides that oral evidence must in all cases

whatsoever, be direct, provides further, in its second proviso that, if oral

evidence refers to the existence or condition of any material thing other

than a document, the court may, if it thinks fit, require the production of

such material thing for its inspection. (Emphasis added.) Such material

things when produced at a trial are referred to as real evidence. Thus, it

would be seen that the law of Evidence has not completely precluded the

presentation of physical material as evidence. Therefore, the sequence to

be followed in the presentation of a physical object as real evidence would

be, first, to present oral evidence regarding the existence or condition of

such a physical object, and thereafter, secondly, invite the Court to

consider permitting the production of such physical object for inspection.

What is important to note is that in terms of section 60 of the Evidence

CA/HCC/174/23

10 | P a g e

Ordinance, once such a material thing is presented to the Court, the

function of the Court is to inspect it. That is for the Judge or Jury as the

case may be, to directly perceive such an object using his or their own

senses. If necessary, the Court may record its observations regarding such

material object that was produced. However, as in the case of oral and

documentary evidence, a physical object is not ordinarily produced at the

trial for the purpose of proving or disproving the existence or non-existence

of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. The practice in Sri Lanka is to refer to

such items as productions. In most other jurisdictions they are referred to

as exhibits. 13 E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy (Volume I, at page 68) in his

monumental work on the Law of Evidence, has stated that though real

evidence does not come within the ambit of Evidence under section 3 of

the Evidence Ordinance, real evidence is an item of judicial evidence and

the judge is called upon to see the thing himself and the knowledge

derivable therefrom is generally obtained without the use of any medium.

However, in view of the second proviso to section 60 of the Evidence

Ordinance which provides for the admission of real / physical evidence, it

is necessary to bear in mind that, such evidence in the nature of physical

objects are not sui generis (does not stand alone by itself), and is

necessarily associated with an item of oral evidence which provides a

description of the existence or condition of such physical item. In other

words, the Court may in terms of section 60 permit the production of a

material object for inspection, only if oral evidence refers to the existence

or the condition of any material thing. In the alternative, acting in terms of

section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance, the Court may on its own motion

order the production of any document or thing in order to discover or to

obtain proper proof of relevant facts. Therefore, such evidence (physical /

real evidence) in my view will serve the purposes of (i) providing clarity to

oral evidence and enable the judge or the jury as the case may be to

correctly comprehend the relevant item of oral evidence, (ii) providing

corroboration of oral testimony and documentary evidence, (iii) being used

CA/HCC/174/23

11 | P a g e

as an aide to the assessment of credibility and testimonial trustworthiness

of testimony provided by one or more witnesses, and (iv) being a basis for

the Court to determine the cogency or sufficiency of evidence presented in

the form of oral and documentary evidence. Thus, an item of real evidence

cannot by itself generally be used to prove the facts in issue, which in

criminal cases amounts to the constituent ingredients of the offence. In

certain situations, a physical object may be produced at a trial for the first

time, for the purpose of its identification. That may aid the proof of a fact

in issue or a relevant fact. The impact or the legal consequences arising out

of the absence of a particular physical item of evidence being presented by

the prosecution at a trial will depend on a host of considerations, including

the attendant facts and circumstances of the case. In such situations, the

principal factor to be taken into consideration is, what purpose, if any,

would the prosecution have achieved, had they produced the relevant item

of real evidence. As 14 E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy has put it, non-

production of a physical object, which might conveniently be produced for

inspection by the Court, does not render oral evidence respecting the same

inadmissible (Volume II, Book I, page 19). The legal consequences arising

out of a doubt being created with regard to the integrity of a physical object

that was produced, would be founded upon a consideration of the purpose

sought to have been achieved by the party which produced the object. The

legal consequences that may arise by a party not producing a material

object which was within their control to produce, would be the rendering

of nugatory the purpose such party could have achieved by having

produced it. It may also affect the cogency of the evidence. There may be

situations where the circumstances of the case may justify the judge from

drawing an adverse presumption in terms of section 114(f) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Considering above cited Supreme Court Judgment and the importance of

tendering material evidence; the non-production of the three-wheeler has

certainly caused great prejudice to the Appellant.

CA/HCC/174/23

12 | P a g e

According to PW1 the purpose for which the Appellant came to the boutique

was to handover heroin to a nearby boutique. But PW8 in his evidence stated

that according to the informer, the purpose for his arrival was to weigh the

Heroin from a retail shop.

According to the evidence of PW1 and PW8, once the three-wheeler was

stopped in front of the car in which the STF Officers were waiting, PW8 had

given a call to the informant. Thereafter two STF Officers in civil attire had

been sent to approach the three-wheeler driver. Thereafter only PW1 had

gone near the three-wheeler. It is in evidence that the two STF Officers who

were sent near the three-wheeler were asked to behave as normal people and

the Appellant was not blocked by anybody, enabling him to get down from

the three-wheeler and to proceed to the boutique. Hence the Counsel for the

Appellant contended that it is highly improbable to believe that the Appellant

remained inside the three-wheeler without even getting down till all steps

were taken by PW1.

The profound duty of the trial court is to consider the evidence placed by the

prosecution and the defence on equal footings to arrive at its finding.

In R v. Hepworth 1928 (AD) 265, at 277, Curlews JA stated:

A criminal trial is not a game where one side is entitled to claim the benefit

of any omission or mistake made by the other side, and a Judge's position

in a criminal trial is not merely that of an umpire to see that the rules of

the game are applied by both sides. A Judge is an administrator of justice,

not merely a figure-head, he has not only to direct and control the

proceedings according to recognised rules of procedure but to see that

justice is done.

In this case the defence witness Wasantha Dilummika was also arrested

along with the Appellant by PW1. After his arrest his retail shop was checked

by the police. From a cupboard underneath the cashier an electronic scale

was recovered during this search. As such, he was arrested and the scale

CA/HCC/174/23

13 | P a g e

which had been recovered from his shop was sent to the Government

Analyst. According to the Government Analyst Report, traces of Heroin had

been detected on the electronic scale recovered from the witnesss shop. But

he was discharged by the Hon. Attorney General from this case. Although he

was discharged, Learned High Court Judge had used the recovery evidence

to disbelieve his evidence. The relevant portion of the judgment is re-

produced below:

Page 582 of the brief.

As correctly argued by the Defence Counsel, this has caused great prejudice

to the Appellant and he was not afforded a fair trial.

In this case the raid was conducted upon receiving three pieces of

information. Further, the arrest and recovery of productions has failed to

pass the probability test in this case mainly due to the existence of glaring

inconsistencies between evidence given by PW1 and PW8 and non-

production of the real evidence which was vital to the case. Had the Learned

Trial Judge looked into the evidence presented in its correct perspective, he

should have accepted the evidence given by the Appellant.

Further, the Appellant had not afforded a fair trial as guaranteed in the

Constitution.

Guided by the above cited judicial decisions, I conclude that the appeal

grounds advanced by the Appellant have very serious impact on the

prosecution case.

CA/HCC/174/23

14 | P a g e

As the prosecution had failed its duty to prove this case beyond reasonable

doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 04/05/2023 on the Appellant. Therefore, he

is acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
