MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The main relief sought by the Petitioner is prayer N, seeking inter alia a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the letters marked P8C and P8D and the decisions of the 5th

and 6th Respondents to grant the possession of and allocate the subject land

situated in Stage II, Grama Niladhari Division 251 of Negenahira Nuwaragam

Palatha, Anuradhapura bearing the Assessment Number 525/A to

Anuradhapura United Traders Association.

We heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this Application.

We also heard the learned DSG for the Respondent as well. The contention of the

Petitioner is mainly that, somewhere in the mid 1990s, the Petitioner submitted

an application to the Provincial Land Commissioner of North Central Province in

order to obtain a permit in respect of the subject land. The Petitioner states

further, that thereafter a Land Kachcheri was held by the then Provincial Land

Commissioner of North Central Province in 1998 and the Petitioner was selected

to be allocated the Subject land, the name of the Petitioner was listed in the

Preliminary list marked P4A and the Final list marked P4B of the selected

allotees of the said Land Kachcheri. The Petitioner states that the Petitioner

came into possession of the subject land in or around 2004 and continued to be

in possession as the Petitioner used to reside in his ancestral home bearing the

Assessment Number 525/39 which is located in front of the subject land. The

Petitioner is in possession pursuant to an alleged permit issued marked P6.

However, it is the Respondents submission that P6 is not a permit but a

temporary lease. Since there is a disagreement as to the facts of this case the

Petitioners cannot invoke the Jurisdiction of this Court. In this regard I refer to

the judgement of Thajudeen Vs. Sri-Lanka Tea Board1where the Court of

Appeal held that;

1 [1981] 2 SLR, 471.

Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the facts

is subject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions should

be canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample opportunity

of examining the witnesses so that the Court would be better able to

judge which version is correct, a Writ will not issue. Mandamus is pre-

eminently a discretionary remedy. It is an extraordinary, residuary

and suppletory remedy to be granted only when there are no other

means of obtaining justice. Even though all other requirements for

securing the remedy have been satisfied by the applicant, the Court

will decline to exercise its discretion in his favour if a specific

alternative remedy like a regular action equally convenient, beneficial,

and effective is available..

Additionally, the Respondents raised two legal objections. Firstly, with regard to

laches, the Respondents submitted that the immediate Application has been

subject to an inordinate delay. The impugned decisions P8C & P8D are dated

04/11/2009 & 05/11/2009 respectively, whereas this Application is filed after

the lapse of 13 years. It is manifestly evident that there is substantial delay in

invoking the jurisdiction of this Court and that the Petitioner has failed to duly

explain the delay.

In this regard, I refer to the observation made In Bisomenike Vs. C. R. de Alwis2,

Sharvananda, J., (as he then was) observed that;

A Writ of Certiorari is issued at the discretion of the Court. It cannot

be held to be a Writ of right or one issued as a matter of course. The

exercise of this discretion by Court is governed by certain well

accepted principles. The Court is bound to issue it at the instance of a

party aggrieved by the order of an inferior tribunal except in cases

where he has disentitled himself to the discretionary relief by reason

of his own conduct, submitting to jurisdiction, laches, undue delay or

2 [1982] 1 SLR, 368.

waiver. The proposition that the Application for Writ must be sought

as soon as the injury is caused is merely an Application of the

equitable doctrine that delay defeats equity and the longer the injured

person sleeps over his rights without any reasonable excuse the

chance of his success in Writ Application dwindles and the Court may

reject a Writ Application on the ground of unexplained delay. An

Application for a Writ of Certiorari should be filled within a reasonable

time.

In Sarath Hulangamuwa Sriwardena Vs. The Principal Vishaka Vidyalaya3,

the Court of Appeal held that;

The Writs are extraordinary remedies granted to obtain speedy relief

under exceptional circumstances and time is of the essence of the

Application. The laches of the Petitioner must necessarily be a

determining factor in deciding the Application for Writ as the Court

will not lend itself to making a stultifying order which cannot be

carried out.

The foregoing line of authorities are united in deciding that the delay and laches

are the most significant aspects to be considered in Writ Applications. If there is

a delay and laches on the part of the Petitioner, which has not been explained to

the satisfaction of the Court, the Court will refuse to issue prerogative Writs.

Secondly, the Respondents submit, according to paragraph 16 of the Petition

there is a fundamental rights application numbered SCFR 647-2010, filed with

the Supreme Court in regards to the same subject which is currently pending.

In particular P8C is submitted to that case as well. Hence the legal issues

pertaining to the issues raised in this Writ Application will be decided by the

Supreme Court in the said Fundamental Rights Application. According to our

procedural law a decision of the Supreme Court as the final appellate court and

3 [1986] 1 SLR, 275.

Page 8 of 8

the superior court of the land will be conclusive and final. Therefore, the

Petitioner cannot invoke the jurisdiction of this Court when the matter has

already been taken up and is pending before the Supreme Court.

In those circumstances, it is the considered view of this Court that the Petitioner

is precluded from invoking the Prerogative Writs jurisdiction of this Court as he

had already invoked the Fundamental Rights jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

in respect of the same grievances. Thus, the instant Writ Application is liable to

be dismissed in-limine.

For the foregoing reasons, I refuse to issue notices on the Respondents and

dismiss the Application. No costs.

Application dismissed, no costs.
