of the Penal Code.

The trial commenced before the High Court Judge of Kalutara as the

Appellants opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution had led 08 witnesses

and marked productions P1-P3 and closed the case.

The learned High Court Judge being satisfied that evidence presented by the

prosecution warranted a case to answer, called for the defence and explained

the rights of the Accused. The 1st Appellant had given evidence from the

witness box and called two witnesses on his behalf and marked 1V1. The 2nd

and 3rd Appellants had provided dock statements and closed their case.

After considering the evidence presented by both parties, the learned High

Court Judge had convicted the Appellants as charged and sentenced them

to death on the 1st count and had imposed a sentence of 05-years rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.25000/- for the second count and a default

sentence of 01-year simple imprisonment on each Appellant on 13/12/2021.

Additionally, each Appellant was ordered to pay Rs.100,000/-as

compensation to PW2 with a default sentence of 01-year simple

imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and the sentence, the Appellants

had preferred this appeal to this court.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants informed this court that the

Appellants had given their consent to argue this matter in their absence. At

the hearing, the Appellants were connected via Zoom platform from prison.

The background of the case albeit briefly is as follows:

PW1, Prabath Victor, nephew of the deceased is the only eyewitness to the

incident in which the deceased was allegedly attacked by the Appellants. On

the day of the incident, 15.04.2007, he had attended the New Year festival

which had been organised near the restaurant of the deceased in Egaluoya.

After attending the festival, he had arrived at Galhena Junction and had set

CA/HCC/65-67/2022

off in a three-wheeler. At that time, he had seen the deceased and PW2

travelling on a motor bike in front of him. When the duo on the motor bike

reached the playground, the witness had first seen the 3rd Appellant jump to

the road, and stop the motorbike. When the deceased got down from the

motor bike and walked away, the 3rd Appellant had dealt a blow on the

deceased from behind. Thereafter the 1st Appellant had attacked the

deceased on the head with a sword. According to PW1, the 2nd Appellant had

only kept a sword across the chest of the deceased in a threatening manner.

PW2, Don Rohitha, who was travelling with the deceased at the time of the

incident stated that the 3rd Appellant waved a club in front of the motorbike

to stop it and assaulted PW2 with the club. He had further stated that he

had seen the 1st and 2nd Appellants among the crowd, but had failed to

mention what they had been doing at that time.

The 1st Appellant had given evidence from the witness box and called a

witness on his behalf. The 2nd and the 3rd Appellants had made statements

from the dock. But in the judgment the learned High Court Judge had

wrongly stated that the 3rd Appellant had given evidence from the witness

box and the 1st and 2nd had made dock statements.

The learned High Court Judge after evaluating the evidence of PW1, PW2 and

other witnesses called by the prosecution, had come to the conclusion that

the evidence presented by the prosecution is convincing and had acted upon

the said evidence to convict the Appellants.

The 1st and 2nd Appellants had raised the following grounds of appeal.

1. The evidence of PW1 and PW2 fails the test of credibility, probability

and consistency.

2. The learned High Court Judge rejected the defence on unreasonable

grounds.

CA/HCC/65-67/2022

5

The 3rd Appellant had raised the following grounds of appeal.

1. There has been totally inadequate analysis of the case for the

prosecution in the light of the many infirmities.

2. The learned Trial Judge has laid much emphasis on the fact that the

accused had absconded after the incident in concluding on their

culpability without considering the circumstances under which they

had to surrender to Court.

3. The learned Trial Judge has relied upon the demeanour of the first

witness for the prosecution when in fact he did not testify before the

learned Judge.

4. The learned Trial Judge has imposed liability on the basis of common

intention without considering the law pertaining to common intention

as laid down in decided cases.

5. There has been total inadequacy in the case for the defence, thereby

causing much prejudice to the Accused Appellant.

6. Due to one or more of the reasons, the Accused Appellants had had

been denied a fair trial, a Fundamental Right Constitutionally

guaranteed.

As the Appeal grounds raised by the Appellants are interconnected, all

grounds will be considered together hereinafter.

In this case according to the prosecution, PW1 is the sole eyewitness of the

murder incident. PW2 had only witnessed the 3rd Appellant blocking their

way and assaulting him. PW2 had further stated that he saw the 1st and 2nd

Appellants among the crowd. Therefore, the Counsels appearing for the

Appellants mainly argued that the evidence of the sole eyewitness does not

inspire the confidence of the Court as it fails the test of credibility and

probability. Hence, it is very important to consider the evidence given by PW1

who had been the sole eyewitness in this case.

CA/HCC/65-67/2022

6

The learned High Court Judge in his judgment had come to the conclusion

that the evidence of PW1 is convincing and that it proved the charge beyond

reasonable doubt.

Eyewitness testimony is one of the most salient types of criminal evidence.

In criminal cases, the judges regularly face the difficult but crucial task of

evaluating eyewitness testimony. This sometimes means checking whether

the witnesss story fits with other established facts of the case. However, the

veracity of such a story cannot always be verified or falsified directly. In such

cases the judges have to look at whether the statement comes from a reliable

source.

Further, an eyewitnesss testimony is probably the most persuasive form of

evidence presented in court, but in many cases, its accuracy is dubious.

There is also evidence that mistaken eyewitness evidence can lead to

wrongful convictionsending people to prison for years or decades, even to

death row, for crimes they did not commit.

In considering the evidence of an eye witness, the Court should look at the

demeanour of the witness, the inherent probability of the account of the days

events, any internal inconsistencies in the account, whether the account is

consistent with previous statements by the witness, whether the witness has

any bias against the accused or any family or group to which the accused

belongs to, whether the evidence at the crime scene supports the account of

events as narrated by the eyewitness, and whether the witnesss testimony

is supported by the testimony of other witnesses. These factors are very

important as the burden of proof is on the prosecution in all criminal cases.

In The Queen v. K. A. Santin Singho 65 NLR 447 the court held that:

It is fundamental that the burden is on the prosecution. Whether the

evidence the prosecution relies on is direct or circumstantial, the burden

is the same. This burden is not altered by the failure of the appellant to

give evidence and explain the circumstances.

PW1 is a close relation of the deceased. The deceased is the brother of PW1s

father. There were two new year celebrations happening on that day. One

was held near the deceaseds restaurant. Having been informed that the

deceaseds house was attacked, the deceased had gone there in a motor bike

with PW2. Although PW2 went with the deceased he had failed to see any of

the Appellants attacking the deceased as claimed by PW1.

Although PW1 said that the 3rd Appellant blocked their way by crossing a

pole, he had failed to mention the same in his statement to the police and in

the NS Inquiry. Subsequently, PW1 had admitted that his statement about

the 3rd Appellant was wrong. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

In the inquest PW1 had admitted that the 1st Appellant had blocked the road.

When giving evidence at the High Court he admitted that the 3rd Appellant

had blocked the road. When he was questioned about this discrepancy, PW1

had admitted what he said in the High Court is not true. The relevant portion

is re-produced below:

Although PW1 had given evidence as an eye witness, PW2 who had gone with

the deceased had not seen PW1 at that time. PW2 had only said that when

the motor bike was stooped, there were 10-12 people. No mention about any

involvement of the Appellants. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

Although it was the stance of PW1 that the 1st Appellant had attacked the

deceased on his head after which the deceased fell on the ground, it was

revealed during cross examination that PW1 had not mentioned the same in

his statement to the police, in the inquest or in the non-summary inquiry.

PW2 who had been with the deceased had not witnessed the 1st and the 2nd

Appellants attacking the deceased. He had only witnessed their presence.

Further he had failed to identify the 3rd Appellant properly and has identified

him as the 2nd Appellant in Court. It was brought to the notice of the Court

that PW2 had not mentioned the name of the 3rd Appellant in his statement

to the police.

The learned Presidents Counsel submitted to Court that in the history to the

doctor PW2 had stated that he hit his head on the road when he fell down.

The facts as set out by the prosecution may not be accurate and they can

even be crooked, but in this background the tool of contradiction and

omission are very effective to shake or shatter the credibility of the

prosecution evidence. Proof of contradiction and omissions though quite

useful in criminal trials, has to be used with circumspection and within a

legal framework. The credibility of the witness does not stand impeached

merely by proving contradictions on record. It is required for the defence side

to show that prosecution witnesses may deliberately depose change or

improve their original statement in order to cause prejudice to the accused.

Similarly, minor omissions or discrepancies in evidence is not enough to hold

CA/HCC/65-67/2022

12

the accused not guilty. Thus, by striking a balance and by evaluating

evidence in proper perspective justice can be delivered. The following cases

are very important in this regard.

1. State Rep. by Inspector of Police v. Saravanan AIR 2009 SC 152

2. Acharaparambath Pradeepan & Anr. v. State of Kerala 2006 13

SCC 643

3. Kehar Singh &amp; Ors v. State (Delhi Admn.) [3] AIR 1988 SC

1883

Although the afore-mentioned omissions and contradictions are quite

important when considering the evidence given by PW1 and PW2, the learned

High Court Judge had failed to take into consideration the said

contradictions and omissions when he assessed the evidence of PW1 with

the evidence of PW2 as it affects the root of the case.

As correctly pointed out by the learned Presidents Counsel who appeared

for the 3rd Appellant, the learned High Court Judge had imposed common

intention on the Appellants without considering the facts of the case in the

light of previous judicial pronouncements. When considering whether the

Appellants acted in furtherance of common intention, it is vital that the judge

decides whether the Appellants entertained a common murderous intention

amongst them.

It is settled law that it is incumbent upon the Trial Judge to take into

consideration all matters which in favour of the Appellants before arriving at

an adverse conclusion against them.

Due to afore-said reasons, I do not think that the evidence given by PW1 and

PW2 could be considered as convincing, reliable, and strong to be considered

under the Evidence Ordinance to convict the Appellants in this case.

CA/HCC/65-67/2022

13

As the evidence given by the prosecution witnesses contains serious doubt

and ambiguity over the prosecution version, the grounds raised by the

Appellants are enough to succeed the appeal in favour of the Appellants.

As the prosecution had failed in its duty to prove this case beyond a

reasonable doubt, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the

learned High Court Judge of Kalutara dated 13/12/2021 on the Appellants.

Therefore, they are acquitted from this case.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Kalutara along with the original case record.
