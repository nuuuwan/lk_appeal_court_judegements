JUDGMENT

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The Suspect-Petitioner-Petitioner (Hereinafter referred to as the

Petitioner) is the suspect in the Colombo Magistrate Court Case bearing

No. B/81648/01/2023.The Petitioner was arrested by Complainant-

Respondent- Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Complainant)

on 07.02.2023 and produced before the Colombo Chief Magistrate

Court and was allegedly charged under Sections

CA(PHC)APN 67-2023

4 | P a g e

386,389,392,400,402,454 of the Penal Code and Under Section 5 of the

Offences Against the Public Property Act No.12 of 1982.

The Petitioner while in remand made an application for bail before the

Magistrate Court of Colombo. After oral and written submissions of the

Counsel for the Petitioner, the Learned Magistrate had refused the said

application and further remanded the Petitioner.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned Magistrate of Colombo,

the Petitioner filed a revision application in the High Court of Colombo

on 28.03.2023 to set aside the said order.

After the inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo by his

order dated 24.05.2023 refused to grant bail to the Petitioner.

The Petitioner was appointed as a Court Clerk Grade II under the

Judicial Management Service by the Judicial Service Commission on

08.02.2012. He was served in the Akkaraipattu Magistrates Court

Registry from his appointment until 31.12.2013 and was transferred to

the Puttalam Magistrates Court and the District Court Registry on

01.01.2014. In the meantime, he was absorbed into the permeant

carder.

From 01.01.2017 the Petitioner was transferred to the Colombo District

Court and served until 31.10.2021 and was transferred to the Registry

of the Chief Magistrates Court of Colombo on 01.11.2021 and

appointed as the in-charge officer of the Production Room.

After assuming duties as the in-charge officer of the production Room of

the Magistrates Court of Colombo, he brought to the notice of the

Registrar of the Court of difficulties in handing the Production Room

alone and he had requested two more staffs to manage the productions

efficiently. Also brought to the attention of the Registrar that the subject

of releasing jewels to the National Gem and Jewellery Authority on

23.11.2022 he had realized an individual impersonated a police

constable named Ramesh (75612) attached to the Criminal

CA(PHC)APN 67-2023

5 | P a g e

Investigation Department surreptitiously carried the jewels 308.14

grams in total weight.

For this loss, the Registrar of the Colombo Magistrate Court lodged a

complaint at the Kesellwatte Police Station on 02.12.2022. Taking over

the investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department, they

arrested the Petitioner on 07.02.2023 and produced him in the

Magistrate Court of Colombo on 08.02.2023.

After the Appointment as the in-charge of the Production Room, a

person named K.A.G.S Kumara who was in-charge of the Production

Room earlier and was made a suspect in case No. 69190/1/22, was

brought to the Production Room from remand prison from 31.08.2022

onwards to assist the Petitioner in taking over the productions. During

this time K.A.G.S. Kumaras relatives and friends had come to meet him

in the area of the Production Room.

The Counsel for the Petitioner contested that the productions in the

official custody which is claimed by a third party and in the even the

Court ordered to release the same, would not fall within the

interpretation of the Public Property under the Section 12 of the

Offences against the Public Property Act No. 12 of 1982. Hence, urged

this Court to consider this grey area in the legal provision as an

exceptional circumstance.

The Counsel for the Petitioner submitted to the Court that the Petitioner

is a father of three children and he is the only bread winner of the

family. Further, his parents are also living with him and her mother is

suffering from cancer and his father is a paralysed person who is also

undergoing medical treatment.

The Petitioner has no previous conviction or pending cases or no

pending disciplinary inquiry under the Establishment Code. He is in

remand custody for more than 09 months.

CA(PHC)APN 67-2023

The State opposing to bail submitted that as the investigation is not

over releasing the Petitioner will hamper the smooth continuation of the

investigation. The Senior State Counsel submitted that the investigation

conducted up to now revealed that there is a strong prima facie case

against the Petitioner.

Exceptional circumstances are not defined in the statute. Hence, what

constitutes exceptional circumstances must be considered on its own

facts and circumstances on a case by case.

Section 8(1) of the Offences Against Public Property Act governs the

granting of bail on persons committed or has been concerned in

committing or is suspected to have committed offences punishable

under the Act. The section reads;

8. (1) The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, No. 15

of 1979, in relation to bail shall apply where any person surrenders

himself or is produced on arrest on an allegation that he has

committed or has been concerned in committing or is suspected to

have committed; or to have been concerned in committing an

offence under this Act:

Provided, however, that where a Gazetted officer not below the rank

of Assistant Superintendent of Police certifies that the value of the

subject-matter in respect of which the offence was committed,

exceeds twenty-five thousand rupees such person shall be kept on

remand until the conclusion of the trial. It shall be competent for

the court in exceptional circumstances to release such person on

bail after recording reasons; therefore.

The Offences Against Public Property Act provided express provision in

releasing a person on bail in such an offence; that is only on

exceptional circumstances. Therefore, if the value involved in the

offence exceeds Rs. 25000/-, the Bail Act does not apply.

CA(PHC)APN 67-2023

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR

180 the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In CA(PHC)APN 107/2018 decided on 19.03.2019 the court held that

remanding for a period of one year and five months without being

served with the in indictment was considered inter alia in releasing the

suspect on bail.

In a bail inquiry when the Petitioner brings to the notice of the Court

the circumstances which could be capable of shaking the prosecution

case, the Court has the discretion to tentatively look to the facts and

circumstances of the case to ascertain whether a reasonable ground

exists or not either to grant or refuse bail. The Court should not probe

into the merits of the case, but restrict itself to the material placed

before it. But, even for the purpose of bail any benefit of doubt arising

in the case must accrue to the Suspect.

Dr.A.R.B.Amerasinghe in his book titled Judicial Conduct, Ethics

and Responsibilities at page 284 observes that:

However, Article 13(5) of our Constitution states that every person

shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty. Article 13(2)

further provides that a person shall not be deprived of personal

liberty except upon and in terms of the order of a judge made in

accordance with procedure established by law.

The State imposes a punishment on the suspect indirectly by

keeping him in remand custody for an uncertain period. Obviously,

that was not the intention of the legislature when it enacted Article

13(5) of the Constitution.

CA(PHC)APN 67-2023

8 | P a g e

One of the grounds urged by the Learned Counsel is that the B report

filed by the Keselwatte Police and further report reports filed

subsequently by the Criminal Investigation Department revealed that

no allegation that the Petitioner has been concerned in committing any

offence. In order to be arrested for a criminal offence there has to be

evidence, there has to be some level of evidence that would lead a

reasonable, cautious police officer to believe the accused guilty. If the

prosecution does not have any incriminating evidence against the

suspect, this circumstance could be considered in adjudicating his bail

application. In considering these matters, the court must bear in mind

the presumption of innocence.

Taking all these into account, especially the state of further

investigation, the period in remand, and other circumstances of the

case, I consider this an appropriate case to grant bail to the Petitioner.

Hence, I order the Petitioner be granted bail with following strict

conditions.

1. Cash bail of Rs.50,000/=.

2. To provide 02 sureties. They must sign a bond of two million

each.

3. The Petitioner and the sureties must reside in the address given

until conclusion of his case.

4. Not to approach any prosecution witnesses directly or indirectly

or to interfere with.

5. To surrender his passport if any, to court and not to apply for a

travel document. The Controller of the Immigration and

Emigration is informed of the travel ban on the Petitioner.

6. To report to the Criminal Investigation Department, Colombo-01

on the last Sunday of every month between 9am to 1pm.

7. Any breach of these conditions is likely to result in the

cancellation of his bail.

The Bail Application is allowed and the learned Magistrate of Colombo

is hereby directed to enlarge the Petitioner on bail on the above bail

conditions.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgment to the

Magistrate Court of Colombo and Officer-in-Charge of the Criminal

Investigation Department, Colombo-01.
