The Circular No. SCL 2009/003 had been issued unilaterally without the employees' consent. The 1st Respondent's position is that the age of retirement is determined by the letter of appointment and mutually revised by Circular No. SCL 2008/043. Therefore, this age of retirement cannot be unilaterally changed by the issuance of Circular No. SCL 2009/003. Consequently, it is claimed that the 2nd Respondent does not cease to be an employee of the Petitioner Bank upon reaching the age of 55 years. Hence, the decision of the Petitioner bank to send the 2nd Respondent on retirement at the age of 55 years was made without consensus ad idem and amounted to a termination of employment.",

Further, Circular X3 stipulates that extensions would be granted to the employees annually until they reach the age of 57 years subject to evaluation of performances and the discretion of the Management. The extension for highly skilled employees who could not be easily replaced and who will contribute to the bottom line directly could be granted annually until they reach the age of 60 years.

Accordingly, it is observed that the 2nd Respondent has ceased to be an employee of the Petitioner Bank by the age of 55 years as specified in Circular X3 by 19.04.2016 reaching the age of retirement. Hence, the provisions of TEWA do not apply, and the 2nd Respondent Commissioner lacks jurisdiction to inquire into the complaint made by the 1st Respondent in terms of Section 3(1)(c)(ii) of TEWA.",
