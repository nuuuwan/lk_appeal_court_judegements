Page 4 of 19

The appellant has pleaded not guilty to all the counts preferred against him, and

after the trial, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo of his judgement dated

06-08-2021 has found the appellant guilty as charged.

After having considered the mitigatory as well as aggravating circumstances, the

learned High Court Judge has sentenced the appellant in the following manner.

On count one, 7 years rigorous imprisonment, in addition, Rs. 5000/- fine, and

in default, 6 months simple imprisonment.

On count two, 7 years rigorous imprisonment, in addition, Rs. 5000/- fine, and

in default, 6 months simple imprisonment.

On count three, 7 years rigorous imprisonment, in addition, Rs. 5000/- fine, and

in default, 6 months simple imprisonment.

On count four, 7 years rigorous imprisonment, in addition, Rs. 5000/- fine, and

in default, 6 months simple imprisonment.

Having considered the fact that the appellant had no previous convictions, the

learned High Court Judge has ordered that the sentences imposed upon all 4

counts shall run concurrently to each other, which means a total period 7 years

imprisonment.

In addition to the above, the learned High Court Judge has ordered the appellant

to pay Rs. 30,000/-, the sum obtained as a bribe in terms of section 26 of the

Bribery Act and in default, he has been ordered to serve a rigorous imprisonment

period of 1 year.

Being aggrieved by the conviction and the sentence, the appellant has preferred

this appeal.

Before considering the grounds of appeal urged, I will now consider the facts in

brief, which led to the conviction of the appellant.

Page 5 of 19

Facts in Brief

PW-01 has commenced a business of servicing and repairing motorcycles on 03-

11-2014. For that purpose, he has employed two persons to assist him in the

business.

Before the incident that led to the indictment, officials from the Employees Trust

Fund Board (ETF) have visited his establishment and had informed him that he

needs to pay ETF for his employees. Accordingly, he has registered himself to

pay ETF and had paid an arrears amount as well. He was in the process of paying

ETF as required.

On 21-03-2017, the appellant to whom PW-01 refers to as Lal Sir has visited

his establishment and has informed that he is from the labour office. The

appellant has inquired whether he is contributing to Employees Provident Fund

(EPF) for his employees, and the appellant has answered in the negative.

After inquiring into the matter, the appellant has informed PW-01 that he will

have to pay an arrears of nearly Rs. 150,000/- as EPF payment. The PW-01 has

informed that he was unaware that he has to pay EPF as well, and that he has

already paid an arrears amount as ETF.

Thereafter, the appellant had instructed him to come to the Matara District

Labour Office on the same day with the relevant documents relating to his

employees. The appellant has given his phone number to PW-01 as well.

After getting the necessary documents ready, PW-01 has given a call to the

appellant and he has informed the PW-01 to come. When PW-01 reached Matara

District Labour Office, the appellant was not there, which has resulted in PW-01

giving a call to the appellant. The appellant has instructed PW-01 to come near

Thudawa, Pinidiya fuel station.

Page 6 of 19

When PW-01 met the appellant at the fuel station, the appellant has informed

PW-01 that he should be looked after for this. When asked by PW-01 what he

should do, the appellant has asked him how much money he has in his

possession. PW-01 has informed him that he has Rs. 5000/- and the appellant

has taken the Rs. 5000/- from him.

Thereafter, the appellant has solicited Rs. 60,000/- from PW-01 to arrange the

EPF payments without any arrears being paid. When PW-01 resisted saying that

he does not have that kind of money, the appellant had stated that he can pay

Rs. 30,000/- first, and should pay the balance in one weeks time.

Accordingly, the appellant has given the necessary application forms to PW-01,

which has been marked at the trial as P-02 (A), (B), (C).

After coming home, PW-01 has discussed this matter with his wife and has

decided to lodge a complaint to Bribery Commission in this regard.

Accordingly, officials of the Bribery Commission have come and met PW-01 on

27-03-2017 at Thihagoda town. The Bribery Department officials had taken

down his complaint and had inquired from PW-01 whether he is willing to assist

the officials in conducting a raid, for which he has agreed.

On instructions, PW-01 has selected one of the officials to accompany him as a

decoy and the officials have instructed him to bandage his hand to look as if he

has an injury to show that it was the reason he is accompanying the decoy. He

has been advised to introduce him as his wifes elder brother if asked by the

appellant. The Bribery Department officials have handed over Rs. 30,000/- to

the decoy to be used in the raid.

Thereafter, PW-01 has given a call using his mobile phone to the appellant, and

the appellant has instructed him to come to his office. The PW-01 and the decoy

has gone to the labour office in the motorcycle belonging to PW-01 bearing

number WP-8811. It was the decoy who has ridden the motorbike as PW-01 was

Page 7 of 19

dressed to pretend that he has a hand injury. Once they reached the labour

office, both of them had gone to meet the appellant.

According to the evidence of PW-01, he has observed that once he saw the decoy,

the appellant appeared to have panicked a bit. The appellant has informed them

that he has a meeting at the office and to come in the afternoon.

Around 4.00 p.m., the appellant has called PW-01 and has informed him that

the meeting was over and come. When he and the decoy returned to the labour

office, the appellant was not available. When PW-01 called the appellant, he has

been informed that he should come near Pinidiya fuel station. When he reached

the said fuel station, PW-01 could not see the appellant. This has resulted him

giving another call to the appellant. While taking this call, PW-01 has observed

the appellant standing near a salon situated nearby, and taking a call.

Thereafter, the PW-01 and decoy has gone near the place where they saw the

appellant. When the PW-01 met with the appellant, he has acted as instructed

and has asked whether the amount can be reduced, for which the appellant has

stated that it cannot be done. The appellant has again promised that his EPF

payments will be arranged without the arrears been required to be paid.

The appellant has informed that he has to go quickly. PW-01 has then gone near

the decoy who was pretending to be the brother-in-law of PW-01. After taking

the money from the decoy, he has returned again to the place where the appellant

was. The appellant without taking the money to his hand has instructed to leave

the money between the seats of his motorbike parked nearby. The appellant has

complied. At that moment, the raiding party of the Bribery Commission has come

and arrested the appellant.

Under cross-examination, the learned Counsel who represented the appellant

has repeatedly asked questions about EPF as well as ETF payments that should

have been paid by the PW-01. The position of PW-01 had been that he did not

know that he has to pay EPF payments as well, and that was the reason why he

did not register himself to pay EPF.

Page 8 of 19

He has admitted that when the appellant came to his establishment on 21-03-

2017, he interviewed his two employees, and has stated that what the appellant

offered was to arrange for EPF payment without an arrears being paid.

He has admitted that when he went to the labour office along with the decoy for

the 1st time, the appellant did not discuss any details of the bribe solicited by

him, but has maintained the position that when the appellant saw the decoy, he

inquired about him more than anything else, and the injury to his hand, before

informing him that he has a meeting and to come in the afternoon.

It appears from the proceedings before the trial Court that the learned Counsel

who represented the appellant had been cross-examined the PW-01 on the same

matter over and over again, which has led to the PW-01 being required to provide

answers to the same questions asked in different ways.

It had been suggested to him that the incident narrated by him before the Court

was not probable. The position of PW-01 has been that he is telling the truth

about what happened. The contradiction marked V-01 had been in relation to

what PW-01 has stated in the 1st statement made by him to the Bribery

Department Officials, about what the appellant told one of his employees when

he interviewed them.

The decoy mentioned by PW-01 had given evidence as PW-02. He has confirmed

the matters that led to him going along with the PW-01 for this raid as the decoy.

According to his evidence, when they went for the 1st time to the labour office,

the PW-01 has informed him that the appellant is not in his office. When PW-01

took a call to the appellant, the appellant has instructed him to come near

Pinidiya fuel station. On their way, they have met the appellant coming in a

motorbike. The appellant, after seeing them had stopped his motorbike and had

informed the PW-01 to come to his office. When they went to the office of the

appellant for the 2nd time, before they could go near him, the appellant has

signaled them to wait and has come near them and had talked to them.

Page 9 of 19

He has inquired about the injured hand of the PW-01 and has also inquired

about the decoy to which PW-01 has replied that he is his brother-in-law, and

because of the injury, he cannot ride the motorbike and that is the reason he

came along with him. After coming out of the labour office with them, the

appellant has informed that he has a meeting and cannot attend to PW-01s

matter now, and will call him in the afternoon.

As a result, both of them have returned to the establishment of PW-01 and while

waiting there, PW-01 has received a call at around 4.00 p.m. where he has been

informed to come to the appellants office. The decoy has corroborated the

evidence of PW-01 as to what happened thereafter, and the arrest of the

appellant by the Bribery Department officials.

When PW-01 was giving evidence, he has stated that after the bribe money was

handed over, he saw the decoy taking a call and video recording of the incident.

However, the stand in that regard by the decoy was that he or his team did not

take any video recording equipment for the raid and he did not record what was

happening using his mobile phone.

At the trial, the two employees of PW-01 have also given evidence corroborating

that the appellant came and inquired from them about their salary and other

information.

The officer who conducted the investigation and the raid, namely, PW-03 have

given evidence providing details of the complaint received by the Commission,

the raid conducted, and the investigations carried out in this regard.

The call record details of the mobile phones of PW-01 and that of the appellant

had been admitted in terms of section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case and when the appellant was called

upon for his defence, he has decided to make a statement from the dock.

Page 10 of 19

He has denied that he solicited a gratification from PW-01 or obtained any bribe

and has claimed that it was impossible for anyone to evade paying EPF for

employees, and has claimed that the evidence of PW-01 was false.

However, he has admitted that he went to the establishment of PW-01 on 21-03-

2017 and inquired about payment of EPF for his employees. He has also

admitted that there were several phone calls between them before he was

arrested on 27-03-2017 and has admitted the fact that he gave necessary

application forms to PW-01 to register him as an EPF payer.

Referring to what happened on the 27th of March, he has stated that he received

a call form PW-01 around 12.15 p.m. and instructed him to come to his office.

He has admitted that he received another call form PW-01 and at that time, he

was not in his office because he went out to buy some food, and he instructed

the PW-01 to wait for him at the office. He has stated that when he went back to

his office, he met PW-01 who was with another person, and has claimed that he

informed the PW-01 that he has a meeting to attend, and therefore, cannot look

into his matter and come later.

He has admitted that he gave a call to PW-01 around 3.55 p.m. and told him to

come to his office again. He has stated that since PW-01 did not come, he left

the office, but about 15 minutes later, when he was near the small bridge

situated close to the Pinidiya fuel station, PW-01 called him, and because of that,

he instructed PW-01 to come there. According to the appellants version of

events, he has waited there, after parking his motorbike nearby, expecting the

PW-01 to arrive. It had been his position that PW-01 who came with the person

whom he met earlier in his motorbike and informed him that he brought Rs

30,000/-. The money is with his brother-in-law who came with him, and to take

that money and conclude his EPF matter.

Page 11 of 19

The appellant has claimed that he refused the request and went to the nearby

boutique. It has been his position that when he returned to the road after having

a chat with the owner of the boutique for about 5 minutes, a white coloured van

came and stopped near him and asked for the money taken as a bribe. He has

claimed that when he denied he took any money, the officials accompanied him

to his bike which was parked nearby and pointed to some money kept between

his travelling bag and the front seat, and asked him to take that. The appellant

has stated that he was arrested thereafter, and taken to the Thihagoda police

station.

The appellant has claimed that this was a set up against him by the police and

the PW-01, and a false allegation against him.

The Grounds of Appeal

Although several grounds of appeal have been urged on behalf of the appellant

in his written submissions, the learned Presidents Counsel who represented the

appellant formulated the following grounds of appeal for the consideration of the

Court.

1. The learned High Court Judge failed to consider the material

contradictions of the evidence of PW-01 and that of the decoy, namely

PW-02.

2. The learned High Court Judge was misdirected when the appellant was

convicted in a situation where there was no evidence to prove the

charges beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant.

The Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

As the two grounds of appeal urged by the learned Presidents Counsel are

interrelated, I will now proceed to consider the said grounds collectively.

Page 12 of 19

Although it was contended that the learned High Court Judge has failed to

consider the material contraindications of PW-01 and 02, I am unable to agree

that there were material contradictions between their evidence in view of the

admissions made by the appellant in his dock statement.

The only contradiction marked in relation to the evidence of PW-01 has been a

contradiction about what PW-01 has stated in his statement about a thing said

by the appellant to his employees when appellant interviewed them.

Having cross the PW-01 over and over again on the same points, an omission

had been highlighted on the basis that he did not tell in his complaint to the

Bribery commission that, the money was solicited in order to arrange for him not

to pay any money as EPF.

However, it is abundantly clear from the evidence of PW-01, when taken as a

whole, his complaint had been to the effect that the appellant demanded money

so that he can arrange for the EPF payments without requiring him to pay any

arrears of EPF, and not to allow him to evade paying EPF. The documents

marked at the trial show that the appellant had in fact given the necessary

application forms to the PW-01 and those applications forms had been completed

as required, when the arrest was made. This goes on to show that the transaction

had been not to allow the PW-01 to avoid paying EPF, but to help him avoid

paying any arrears of EPF.

The only deficiency between the evidence of PW-01 and 02 had been in relation

to what occurred when both of them went to meet the appellant. The PW-01 has

failed to mention that when they went to the office of the appellant for the first

time, he was not there, but they met him later on the road and came to the office

of the appellant when asked by him to come.

The evidence of PW-02 has been to the effect that it was only after they went to

his office for the second time, the appellant spoke to them and informed that he

has a meeting and cannot attend to the matter.

Page 13 of 19

If one looked at this omission in its isolation, one may claim that there was a

deficiency in the evidence between the two witnesses in that regard. However, in

the dock statement, the appellant has admitted what happened at that time,

exactly in the similar manner the PW-02 has stated as to what occurred at the

office of the appellant.

This shows that, PW-01 has omitted to say in greater detail, not because he was

telling an untruth, but because he has been subjected to a lengthy cross-

examination on the same matter and nothing else.

I am of the view that such omissions as to details of an incident can occur in any

case due to various reasons.

At this stage it is appropriate to refer to the Indian case of Bhoginbhai Hitijibhai

Vs. State of Gujarat (AIR 1983-SC 753 at pp 756-758) where it was held:

1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a videotape is

replayed on the mental screen.

2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness

could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element of

surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be attuned to

absorb the details.

(3) The powers of observation differ from person to person. What one may

notice, and the other may not. An object or movement might emboss its

image on one persons mind, whereas it might go unnoticed on the part

another.

(4) By and large people cannot accurately recall a conversation and

reproduce the very words used by them or heard by them. They can only

recall the main purpose of the conversation. It is unrealistic to expect a

witness to be a human tape recorder.

Page 14 of 19

I am of the view that, for any omission or contradiction inter se or per se of the

evidence placed before the Court, has to be material contradictions or omissions

that creates a reasonable doubt as to the trustworthiness of the evidence of the

witnesses. Such contradictions or omissions should be matters that go into the

core of the prosecution case.

In the case of State of U P Vs. Ashok Kumar Srivastava AIR 1992 SC 840, it

was stated that Prosecution is not required to meet any and every hypothesis

put forward by the accused.

In the case of Inder Singh and Anr. Vs. State (Delhi Admn.) (AIR 1978 SC

1091) it was held:

A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary, trivial or merely possible doubt,

but a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense. It must grow out of

the evidence in the case. If a case is proved perfectly, it is argued that it is

artificial; if a case has some flaws inevitable because human beings are

prone to err, it is argued that it is too imperfect. One wonders whether in the

meticulous hypersensitivity to eliminate a rare innocent from being

punished, many guilty persons must be allowed to escape. Proof beyond

reasonable doubt is a guideline, not a fetish.

In the case of State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. Anthony 1985 AIR SC 48, the danger

of disbelieving an otherwise truthful witness on account of a trifling

contradictions have been spotlighted. It has been stated that;

The witness should not be disbelieved on account of trivial discrepancies,

especially where it is established that there is a substantial reproduction in

the testimony of the witness in relation to his evidence before the Magistrate

or in the session court and that minor variation in language used by witness

should not justify the total rejection of his evidence.

For the reasons as considered above, I find no merit in the 1st ground of appeal

urged by the learned Presidents Counsel, as I am unable to find any deficiencies

in the evidence that goes into the core of the matter.

Page 15 of 19

The next ground of appeal urged by the learned Presidents Counsel was to the

effect that, there was no evidence to establish the case against the appellant

beyond reasonable doubt, and the learned High Court Judge was misdirected

when it was determined so.

It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that, he concedes that

no corroboration is necessary at all the time to prove a fact, but it was contended

that the evidence of PW-01 was contradictory, and therefore, his evidence should

not have been relied on by the learned High Court Judge.

However, as I have considered before, I do not find a basis to consider the

evidence of PW-01 as unreliable, therefore not trustworthy.

It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that since the money

was not found in the possession of the appellant, given the facts and the

circumstances, the incident could well be a setup against the appellant and that

fact should have been considered in favor of him. It was submitted that where

any doubt arises in that relation, it should have been considered, and the benefit

of the doubt should have gone in favor of the appellant.

In considering whether this could have been a set up against the appellant, the

evidence led by the prosecution and the defence taken up by the appellant needs

to be considered as a whole and not in isolation.

The appellant has admitted almost all of the facts narrated by PW-01 in this

regard and also the telephone conversations he had with him, and most of the

matters occurred on the day of the incident. But what he has denied was that,

he solicited a bribe or he told the PW-01 to place the money between the seats

of his motorbike.

It is an admitted fact that the money was recovered by the officials of the Bribery

Commission between the seats of the motorbike.

Page 16 of 19

The evidence clearly shows that the appellant was unknown to PW-01 until he

came to his establishment on 21-03-2017 and inquired of his non-payment of

EPF. It was obvious that if he registered to pay EPF in 2017, he would have to

pay about 3 years arrears of EPF.

It is clear from the evidence of PW-01 when the officials from Employees Trust

Fund registered him to pay ETP, he had to pay an arrears of around Rs.8000/-,

which means that, PW-01 was aware that he would have to pay arrears of EPF

as well.

It is under these circumstances the PW-01 says that the appellant informed him

that he will have to pay around one hundred and fifty thousand rupees as

arrears. It was only after PW-01 went and met him at his office, the appellant

has informed him that he will have to look after him so that he can arrange for

him to register to pay EPF without an arrears being paid. It is in that process the

appellant has demanded a bribe. I do not find any reason not to believe the

version of events as stated by PW-01 in that regard. It shows that when the

appellant met the PW-01 for the 1st time, he has been forced to give Rs.5000/-

to him and it was only after that payment the additional sum had been

demanded.

The chronology of events that has been established at the trial shows that there

was no reason for the PW-01 to concoct a story against the appellant.

The telephone details provided, and admitted by the appellant clearly show that

such calls have been made.

If the appellant was only performing his legal duties in relation to getting the PW-

01 registered to pay EPF for his employees, there was no necessity for him to

keep on contacting the PW-01 in this manner. There was no necessity for him to

tell PW-01 to come and meet him at a place other than his office. If PW-01 did

Page 17 of 19

not come and meet as told, he could have very well told him to come and meet

him at his office at the next available day.

It clearly appears from the evidence that, the appellant being a government

servant was well aware of the repercussions he will have to face if he was caught

taking a bribe. His actions clearly show that, once he saw a stranger in the

company of PW-01 when he met them at his office on the date of the incident,

he has taken care not to accept any bribe or to utter words in relation to that,

but only to get out of the situation by stating that he has a meeting to attend

and will call later. That may be the very reason why both the witnesses say that

the appellant was inquisitive about the stranger and questioned them in that

regard.

However, it appears that the greed for money has overcome him, which has

resulted in him calling the PW-01 to come and meet him at the place where the

arrest was made. The appellant may have thought that, by not taking money

directly to his hand, he will have a better way of explaining his conduct. However,

it is my view that the evidence placed before the Court has proved beyond

reasonable doubt that the money recovered between the seats of the motorbike

belonging to the appellant was the money solicited and obtained by him from

PW-01.

Although PW-01 has stated in his evidence that he saw the decoy video recording

what was happening, it was not clear whether he states that in relation to what

happened after the arrest of the appellant by the bribery officials or when the

money was being placed on the motorbike as demanded by the appellant.

However, the evidence in that regard by PW-02, the decoy, had been that he did

not video record the incident using his mobile phone. But he has admitted that

he made an attempt to take a call to the bribery officials to alert them about the

incident. It is quite obvious that, PW-01 may have seen this as video recording

of the incident.

Page 18 of 19

It is my view that, there was no probability of video recording using a mobile

phone by the decoy, as it would lead to a suspicion been created about him by

the appellant, which may lead to the failure of the raid. It is hard to believe that

the decoy being so close to the PW-01 and the appellant, and a person whom the

PW-01 has introduced as his brother-in-law, and being a police officer, would

make such a move which may jeopardize the whole operation.

I find no basis to accept that the evidence of PW-01 in relation to the time it took

for the investigating officers to arrest the appellant creates an improbability of

the version of events as narrated by the PW-01, in view of the admission by the

appellant in his dock statement.

I find no basis to accept the argument that the learned High Court Judge has

failed to consider the dock statement of the appellant in the correct perspective.

I am of the view that, the dock statement has been well considered along with

the evidence led in this matter and the learned High Court Judge has rightly

concluded that the dock statement, does not create a doubt on the evidence of

the prosecution.

For the reasons considered as above, I find no basis for the second ground of

appeal urged either.

It needs to be noted that it is the same Judge who heard the entirety of the

evidence has pronounced the judgement. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that

the learned trial Judge had the advantage of hearing the evidence in its entirety

and observing the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses.

In the case of Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 SLR 119, G. P. S. De

Silva, J. (As he was then) reiterated that the Court of Appeal would not likely

disturb the findings of primary facts made by a trial Judge unless it is manifestly

wrong as they have the priceless advantage of observing the demeanour of

witnesses which the Judges of the Court of Appeal does not have.

Page 19 of 19

In the case of De Silva and Others Vs. The Attorney General (2010) 2 SLR

169 it was held:

Credibility is a question of fact, not law. Appeal Court Judges repeatedly

stress the importance of trial judges observation of demeanor of witnesses

in deciding questions of fact. The acceptance or rejection of evidence is

therefore is a question of fact for the trial judge. Since he or she is in the best

position to hear and observe witnesses. In such a situation the Appellate

Courts will be slow to interfere with the findings of a trial judge unless such

evidence could be shown to be totally inconsistent or perverse and lacking

credibility. Evidence must be weighed and not counted.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed for want of merit. The conviction and the

sentence dated 06-08-2021 affirmed.
