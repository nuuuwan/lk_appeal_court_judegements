The Petitioner had appeared in Court on all relevant dates but failed to

appear on 15.10.2020, 03.12,2020 and 18.02.2021 as he was

remanded to other alleged criminal cases.

When the Petitioner appeared on 16.11.2021 the Learned High Court

Judge of the Balapitiya had imposed additional bail conditions on him.

Although the Petitioner had appeared before the High Court of

Balapitiya on several days, but he was again remanded for other cases.

When he was brought to Court by the Prison Authority on 28.08.2023,

the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya had directed the Prison

Authority to produce the Petitioner before him on 04.09.2023. On that

day the High Court the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya

cancelled all his previous bail orders and made a fresh order to keep

him in remand custody until the conclusion of the trial in the Balapitiya

High Court case No. CR1.2327/20.

Due to cancellation of his bail in case No. CR1/2327/20, the Petitioner

filed this revision application on following exceptional circumstances.

a) The said order violates the presumption of innocence which is

a fundamental principle of criminal law.

b) The said order is contrary to the provisions of the Bail Act No:

30 of 1997.

c) The said order amounts to a punishment of an accused pending

the conclusion of a criminal trial.

d) The said order gives rise to an indefinite incarceration of an

accused, pending the conclusion of a criminal trial.

e) The said period of incarceration amounts to an oppressive

period of incarceration.

When this matter was supported for notice, it was revealed that the

Petitioner, while on the High Court bail in case No. CR1/2327/20 he

had been remanded for three cases pending before the Magistrate Court

of Balapitiya. After considering the submissions of the prosecution and

on behalf of the Petitioner the Learned High Court Judge had cancelled

his bail and ordered him to be detain in remand until conclusion of the

High Court case. The reverent portion of the order dated 04.09.2023 of

the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya is re-produced below:

The Learned High Court Judge had correctly considered the Section

14(1) (a) (iii) of the Bail Act and all-relevant circumstances of the case

when he cancelled bail to the Petitioner after giving his reasons as per

Section 15 of the Bail Act.

Further, as per the Section 14(3) of the Bail Act, the Court may at any

time, where it is satisfied that there has been a change in the

circumstances pertaining to the case, rescind or vary any order made

by it under subsection (1) of the Bail Act.

Considering all the factors into account very carefully, this is not an

appropriate case to issue notice to the Respondent at this stage. Hence,

this revision application is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this order to the High

Court of Balapitiya for information.

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
