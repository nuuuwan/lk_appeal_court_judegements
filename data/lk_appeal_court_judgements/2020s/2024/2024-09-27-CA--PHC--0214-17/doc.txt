Facts of this case

3) The Petitioner-Appellant is hereinafter referred to as the Appellant

and the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent is hereinafter

referred to as the 1st Respondent.

4) The 1st Respondent being the Range Forest Officer had instituted

an action against the 3rd and 4th Respondents at the Magistrates

Court of Mahawa under the Forest Ordinance entering a reserve

forest, felling six teak trees and transporting the said timber in the

vehicle No.MWPA-2814.

5) Initially, the 2nd and 3rd Respondent had not pleaded guilty.

However, subsequently, they had withdrawn their plea and pleaded

guilty for the charge sheet which was filed by the 1st Respondent.

6) After finding the said 3rd and 4th Respondents guilty of the charges

to which they had pleaded, the Learned Magistrate had held an

inquiry regarding vehicle No.MWPA-2814 to determine whether

reasons to prevent its confiscation existed.

7) After the conclusion of the said inquiry the Learned Magistrate

ordered the confiscation of the said vehicle.

8) Dissatisfied with the Order of the Learned Magistrate, the

Appellant had preferred a revision application before the High

Court of Kurunegala.

9) The Learned High Court Judge had dismissed the application for

revision filed by the Appellant.

10) Aggrieved by the said Order, the Appellant has preferred this

appeal.

11) The grounds raised by the Appellant are that the 3rd and 4th

Respondents had committed the offence which they were punished

by the Magistrates Court, without the knowledge of the Appellant,

the registered owner of the vehicle. The said facts had not been

C.A. (PHC) 214-17

6

duly considered by the Learned Magistrate and or the High Court

Judge.

12) On the said grounds, the Appellant has sought to obtain the reliefs

prayed for in the plaint.

Disputed Facts

13) This case was taken up for argument on 6thAugust 2024. Counsel

for the Appellant and the State Counsel appearing for the 1st and

2nd Respondents concluded the argument.

14) As per the argument raised by the Appellant and on perusal of the

documents the following disputed points should be considered.

(i) Were the 3rd and 4th Respondents found guilty in the

Mahawa Magistrate Court Case No.70197 for felling six Teak

trees from the reserve forest and transporting it in vehicle

No.MWPA-2814?

(ii) If so, was there an inquiry held to confiscate the vehicle

No.MWPA-2814 for transporting illegal timber?

(iii) Has the Learned Magistrate considered the evidence and the

documents pertinent to the aforesaid inquiry?

(iv) Has the Learned High Court Judge considered the order

made by the Learned Magistrate?

(v) If so, can the Appellant maintain this action

i) Were the 3rd and 4th Respondents found guilty in the

Mahawa Magistrate Court Case No.70197 for felling six

Teak trees from the reserve forest and transporting it in

vehicle No.MWPA-2814?

15) The 1st Respondent had filed a B report in Mahawa Magistrate

Court against the 2nd and 3rd Respondents in the instant

C.A. (PHC) 214-17

7

application. The said B report is found on page 74 of the High

Court brief.

16) Subsequently at page 94 for the said B report the charge sheet had

been filed by the 1st Respondent against the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents. Referring to page 95 of the said brief the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents had withdrawn their earlier plea and pleaded guilty

for the charge sheet filed at page 94 of the High Court brief.

17) On that the Learned Magistrate has imposed a fine against the 2nd

and 3rd Respondents.

18) Thus, it is evident that the Learned Magistrate of Mahawa had

punished the 2nd and 3rd Respondents.

ii) If so, was there an inquiry held to confiscate the vehicle

No.MWPA-2814 for transporting illegal timber?

19) Learned Magistrate of Mahawa had conducted an inquiry to

determine whether the vehicle No. MWPA-2814 should be

confiscated.

20) During the said inquiry the parties have led evidence. Upon

conclusion of the said inquiry, the Learned Magistrate of Mahawa

had delivered the Order confiscating the vehicle No. MWPA-2814.

iii) Has the Learned Magistrate considered the evidence and

the documents pertinent to the aforesaid inquiry?

21) On perusal of the Order made by the Learned Magistrate, as found

on page 126 of the High Court brief, it is evident that the Learned

Magistrate had scrupulously considered the facts and the

documents pertinent to the inquiry held before him. Subsequently,

had decided to confiscate the vehicle.

C.A. (PHC) 214-17

22) I draw my attention to page No, 126 and 129. The Appellant in

this case had stated that he had purchased the vehicle from the

2nd Respondent on 3rd February 2011, while the incident pertinent

to the charge sheet, had occurred on 28th February 2011. The

forms MT6 and MT8 forms had been tendered to the Registrar of

Motor Vehicles on 15th March 2011.

23) On the face of it, the Appellant and the 2nd Respondent had

collusively acted to mislead Court by stating that the Appellant

was the owner of the said vehicle at the time the offence was

committed by the 2nd Respondent.

24) The Learned Magistrate thoroughly considered this fact by

providing a hearing to the Department of Motor Traffic officials and

in reviewing the documents pertinent to registration.

25) Therefore, it is my considered view that the Learned Magistrate

had carefully considered the evidence and the documents pertinent

to this action.

iv) Has the Learned High Court Judge considered the order

made by the Learned Magistrate?

26) On perusal of the High Court Judges Order dated 6th September

2017, the Learned High Court Judge had very well considered the

Order made by the Learned Magistrate in the instant application

confiscating vehicle No.MWPA-2814.

27) In the said Order, on page No. 2 to 4, the Learned High Court

Judge had reiterated that the ownership had not been transferred

during the period in which the 2nd and 3rd Respondents had

committed the offence referred to in the Mahawa Magistrate Court

case No. 70197.

C.A. (PHC) 214-17

28) In the inquiry held before the said Magistrate, related to the vehicle

No. MWPA-2814, the Appellant had failed to prove that the

Appellant was the registered owner of the aforesaid vehicle and the

2nd and 3rd Respondents committed the offence without his

knowledge.

29) Considering the said facts, the Learned High Court Judge had

decided that there are no exceptional circumstances to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court to set aside the Learned

Magistrates order.

30) I concur with the High Court Judges Order after perusing the

Learned Magistrates reasons given to confiscate vehicle No.

MWPA-2814.

v) If so, can the Appellant maintain this action?

31) In considering the aforesaid analysis I am of the view the Appellant

has failed to prove a single reason to set aside the order made by

the Learned High Court Judge.

In a revisionary application, it is decided in Hotel Galaxy Ltd v

Mercantile Hotel Management Ltd (1987)1, Sharvananda CJ

stated;

It is settled law that the exercise of revisionary

powers of the Appellate Court is confined to cases

in which exceptional circumstances exist

warranting its intervention.

1 1 SLR 5

C.A. (PHC) 214-17

10

And in the case of Cademmanpulle v Ceylon Paper Sacks Ltd

(2001) 2 it was held;

The existence of exceptional circumstances is a

precondition for the exercise of the powers of

revision

32) In the said cases, a revisionary jurisdiction can be exercised only

in a limited category of situations and exceptional circumstances

warrant such intervention.

33) On perusal of the Learned High Court Judges Order, it is evident

that there are no exceptional circumstances and or reasonable

grounds proven by the Appellant for the High Court Judge to

invoke the Writ Jurisdiction.

34) Furthermore, the Learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge

had observed the lack of any explanation given by the Appellant at

the Mahawa Magistrates Court inquiry for the delay of submitting

transfer papers necessary to register the confiscated vehicle in his

name.

35) It is apparent that the Appellant, along with the 2nd and 3rd

Respondents, being friends, have collusively worked to mislead the

Court producing the Department of Motor Traffic documents.

36) In the said circumstances, I draw my attention to the decision

given by Justice K. Priyantha Fernando in the case of W.M Piyal

Senadheera v AG Appeal 3;

Further, where one relies on the position that a third-party owner of a vehicle must be treated differently and that there should be no automatic confiscation and that a hearing should be accorded to such a person, as set out under the Forest Ordinance and the Animals Act, the proviso in its entirety should be considered. One cannot simply request that the proviso should be applied to the extent where it is

2 3 SLR 112 3 No. 249/2017

C.A. (PHC) 214-17

11

beneficial to them. The proviso is conditional on the word if. The benefit of the proviso could only be attained if the owner of the vehicle proves to the satisfaction of the Court that he has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle in question or that the vehicle has been used without his knowledge.

37) In view of the aforesaid decision and the facts analyzed by me I do

not see any reason to set aside the Order made by the Learned

High Court Judge on 6th September 2017.

CONCLUSION

38) In the light of the facts stated above, in considering the argument

raised by the counsels and perusal of the documents, the

Appellant had failed to satisfy this Court and/or given any reason

to satisfy to set aside the Order made by the Learned High Court

Judge, Provincial High Court of Kurunegala dated 6th September

2017.

39) On that, I dismiss the Appellants petition dated 20th September

2017 subject to tax cost.
