JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The Complainant-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Complainant) instituted action in the Magistrate Court of Welimada

citing in the circuit in Thuppitiya under MC (Circuit) Thuppitiya Case

No. 83058 against the Accused-Appellants-Petitioners (Hereinafter

referred to as the Petitioners) and another Accused (4th Accused), who

was absent and unrepresented from the inception to the end of trial,

alleging that on or about 09th November 1994 the Petitioners together

with 4th accused committed offences punishable under Sections

140,434,419 and 410 of the Penal Code.

As the 4th Accused was absent to Court, an inquiry was held under

Section 192 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 and

fixed trial in absentia of 4th accused.

The prosecution had called four witnesses and closed their case. Having

satisfied that there was a case to be answered, the Magistrate had

called for the defence. Having chosen right to remain silence, the

Petitioners filed their written submission.

On 14th of December 2000, the Learned Magistrate had pronounced the

judgment and convicted the Petitioners on all the charges. On 25th

January 2001, the Learned Magistrate imposed the following sentences

to the Petitioners.

1st Charge Rs. 1000/- fine.

2nd Charge Rs. 1000/- fine.

CA (PHC) APN 168/2013

5 | P a g e

3rd Charge Rs. 1000/ fine with 2-year rigorous imprisonment

suspended for 5 years.

4th Charge Rs. 1500/ Fine.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Magistrate, the Petitioners filed an

Appeal in the Provincial High Court of Uva Province holden in Badulla

to set aside the judgment of the Learned Magistrate of Thuppitiya. After

the inquiry, the Learned High Court Judge had affirmed the conviction

against the Petitioners and enhanced the sentence in the following

manner.

1st Charge Rs. 2500/ fine.

2nd Charge Rs. 2500/ fine.

3rd Charge Rs. 2500/ fine with 02-years rigorous imprisonment.

4th Charge Rs.2500/ fine.

Now the Appellant had filed this appeal to set aside the judgment of the

Learned High Court Judge of Badulla dated 25.01.2006.

The Counsel for the Appellant mainly argued that whether an appellate

court can enhance the sentence, in the absence of an application by the

prosecution.

In this case the Learned High Court Judge of Badulla on his own

motion had increased the sentences imposed by the Learned Magistrate

of Thuppitiya on 25.01.2000. The Learned State Counsel who appeared

for the Complainant had not made any application to enhance the

sentence imposed by the Learned Magistrate. The relevant portion is re-

produced below:

Even though the High Court is competent to increase the sentence

originally passed by a Magistrate, the Appellant should have been asked

to show cause why the sentence imposed on him by the Magistrate

should not be enhanced. In absence of such an opportunity either

afforded to the Appellant personally or through his pleader, no

enhancement of sentence is justifiable as it prejudices the Appellant to

a fair inquiry.

In Bandara v Republic of Sri Lanka [2002] 2 SLR 277 Gamini

Amaratunga, J. prior to considering a variation in sentence, held that:

We, therefore, called upon the accused-appellant to show cause

why his sentence should not be enhanced and we give him time to

show cause.

In SC/SPL/LA No. 201/2006 the Supreme Court held that:

It is a cardinal principle that the accused person ought to be given

an opportunity to present to court any argument that he might have

against the enhancement of the sentence.

In this case, the Learned High Court Judge had not given an

opportunity to the Appellant to present his argument against the

enhancement of the sentence. This is clear violation of principle of

natural justice embodied in the maxim audi alteram partem.

Hence, it is very important that an Appellant never be subjected to a

greater punishment by a Superior Court unless he or she afforded an

opportunity to show cause against the proposed enhancement.

Further, judicial power of revision, which should be primarily used only

to right serious injustices and not to increase sentences in general

fashion.

Hence, I set aside the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Badulla

dated 25.01.2006 and affirm the order of Learned Magistrate of

Thuppitiya dated 14.12. 2000.

Therefore, this appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgement to the

High Court of Badulla and the Magistrate Court of Thuppitiya.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.

I agree.
