The appellant Reckitt Benckiser (Lanka) Limited has made the Tax Appeals

Commission sending to this Court a case stated on the following questions of

law,

(01) Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?

(02) Is the determination made by the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue time barred?

(03) Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in coming to the conclusion

that the appellant was a manufacturer within the contemplation of the

Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 (as amended)?

(04) Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission against the weight

of evidence?

(05) Is the amount of Value Added Tax and penalty payable, as confirmed by

the Tax Appeals Commission excessive arbitrary and unreasonable?

(06) In view of the facts and circumstances of the case did the Tax Appeals

Commission err in law when it arrived at the conclusion that it did?

The above questions of law will be examined in turn.

Question No. 01:

(01) Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?

According to the appellant, the first hearing before the Tax Appeals

Commission was on 08th January 2019.

The determination of the Tax Appeals Commission is dated 17th June 2020.

The number of days within those two dates are 526.

The position of the appellant is, that, whereas the statutory time limit is 270

days, the determination was made one year and six months after the first date

of hearing, which is 08thJanuary 2019.

The date of the determination being 17thJune 2020, it was 526 dates.

Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act as it originally stood said,

The Commission shall hear all appeals received by it and make its

decision in respect thereof, within one hundred and eighty days from the

date of the commencement of the hearing of the appeal:

Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commissions Act No. 23 of 2011 was amended

by two subsequent Amendment Acts. They are,

(i) Section 07 of Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act No. 04 of

2012 and

(ii) Section 07 of Tax Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act No. 20 of

2013

Section 7(2) of (Amendment) Act No. 04 of 2012 provided, that,

by the substitution for the words within one hundred and eighty days

from, of the words within two hundred and seventy days of; and

Section 13 of the (Amendment) Act further provided, that,

13.

The amendments made to the principal enactment by the provisions of

section 10 of this Act, shall be deemed for all purposes have come into

effect on March 31, 2011.

The side note of this section says Retrospective effect.

The Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 was also certified on 31st

March 2011.

Hence the first amendment to section 10 of Tax Appeals Commission also dates

back to the date of the commencement of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No.

23 of 2011.

Then, section 07 of (Amendment) Act No. 20 of 2013 provided, that,

5 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

7.

Section 10 of the principal enactment as last amended by the Tax

Appeals Commission (Amendment) Act, No.4 of 2012 is hereby amended

by the substitution for all the words commencing from two hundred and

seventy days to the end of that section, of the following:-

two hundred and seventy days from the date of the

commencement of its sittings for the hearing of each such

appeal:

Section 14(1) of the (Amendment) Act further, provided, that,

14.

(1) The amendments made to the principal enactment [other than the

amendments made to section 2, the proviso to subsection (1) of section 7

and the amendments made in relation to the appeals under the Customs

Ordinance

(Chapter 235)] by the provisions of this Act shall be deemed for all

purposes to have come into force on April 1, 2011.

The side note of this section says Retrospective effect.

The Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011 was certified on 31st March

2011.

Hence the second amendment to section 10 of Tax Appeals Commission dates

back to the immediate date that follows the date of the commencement of

the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011.

6 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Section 13 of the first amendment and section 14 of the second amendment

both relates to the Retrospective effect.

But, it is not a mere retrospective effect. It is a retrospective effect with a

specific date.

The period of only one day, from 31.03.2011 to 01.04.2011 is also meticulously

covered by section 14(2) of (Amendment) Act, which says,

(2) The amendment made to section 2 of the principal enactment by

the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No.4 of 2012 shall be deemed for all

purposes to have come into force on March 31, 2011 and any act or

decision made by the Commission during the period commencing on

March 31, 2011 up to the date of coming into operation of this Act shall

be deemed to have for all purposes to have been validly made.

It may be noted, that, what was originally 180 days, which was then extended

for 270 days, by the initial amendment was later amended to say 270 days

from the date of the commencement of its sittings for the hearing of

each such appeal:

This is a substantial increase of time for the Tax Appeals Commission. The

period of 270 days, after the later amendment, does not commence to run until

the Tax Appeals Commission commences the hearing of the appeal.

It may be noted, that, the time limit was twice amended and on both occasions

with retrospective effect. If this time limit has no force in law why should the

legislature take such fervent and meticulous care is a question that should be

answered.

Kanagasabapathy J. Sripavan J., (later Hon. Chief Justice) (with Sarath Nanda

Silva C. J. and Gamini Amaratunge J., agreeing) said,

The court cannot give a wider interpretation to section 16 as claimed

by the learned Deputy Solicitor General merely because some financial

loss may in certain circumstances be caused to the state. Considerations

of hardship, injustice or anomalies do not play any useful role in

construing fiscal statutes. One must have regard to the strict letter of the

law and cannot import provisions in the Customs Ordinance so as to

apply and assume deficiency.

More will be said about this case when it is considered in respect of the

substantive question of this case. For the time being it appears to this Court,

that, in as much as in that case the Supreme Court did not allow to import

provisions from the Customs Ordinance, in this case with regard to the

question of the construction of the time limit in section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act a comparison cannot be made with the VAT Act. Doing so will

violate the principle One must have regard to the strict letter of the law

As the appellant submits in the above Written Submission at paragraph 113

the judgment of the Supreme Court in the above case is consistent with a large

number of judgments in England on the same issue. This will be examined

morefully under the Question No. 04 below.

It appears to this Court, that, here the Court in C. A. Tax 17/2017 had

considered two different questions at once.

The question whether section 10 (as amended) is directory or mandatory is one

question. The question as to what will happen if it is held to be mandatory, for

if it is held to be directory the tribunal will have unlimited time of

determining the appeal, is another. There is no doubt that there is a close

connection with the two questions. But answer to one question must affect the

answer to the other only when the rules of interpretation so permits in the view

of this Court.

The respondent often relies upon N. S. Bindra on Interpretation of Statutes.

Narotam Singh Bindras book, having reference to the Golden Rule and other

rules of interpretation and several Indian, as well as, other cases had its 12th

Edition in 2017.

He commences the 03rd Chapter in his 08th Edition as follows,

1. Golden Rule Warburton's case; Becke v. Smith Burton, J., in

Warburton v. Loveland, (1928) 1 Hudson and B. Irish cases 623,648,

observed 'I apprehend it is a rule in the construction of statutes, that, in

the first instance, the grammatical sense of the words is to be adhered

to. If that is contrary to, or inconsistent with any expressed intention, or

declared purpose of the statute, or if it would involve any absurdity,

repugnance, or inconsistency, the grammatical sense must then be

modified, extended, or abridged so far as to avoid such inconvenience,

but no further. The elementary rule is that words used in a section must

be given their plain grammatical meaning.

The grammatical sense of section 10 is that the Tax Appeals Commission

must give its determination on the appeal within 270 days from the

commencement of its sittings in respect of that particular appeal. That

section or any other section does not say about the consequences of non

compliance. On the other hand that section or any other section also does

not confer power to extend the time. Now will the interpretation of this

section to be mandatory result in any absurdity, repugnance or inconsistency?

There are other provisions too in this Act which provide for time limits.

For example section 7(2) says,

11 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

(2) A person to whom a right to appeal has accrued in terms of the

provisions of the enactments specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of

subsection (1) of section 7, shall notify the Commission within thirty

days of the determination being communicated to him under the

respective laws, of the fact that he intends to prefer an appeal to the

Commission against such determination. He shall state all relevant

details of the determination in such notification including the name and

address of his authorized representative, if any.

No one argues, that, this is not mandatory. It is on the basis that in respect of

a citizen a time limit is mandatory and in respect of the state it is directory.

The basis here, not to follow the basic precept What is good for the goose is

good for the gander does not find its foundation just because one is a citizen

and the other is the state. Its footing, as it would appear, is based on much

firmer grounds.

This basis was considered by the learned Chief Justice who headed the 09

Judge Bench in Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage [(1985) 1 SLR 203] N. D. M.

Samarakoon Q. C. and in fact, the Court in C. A. Tax 17/2017 referred to this

decision.

The quotation, which the Court referred to in C. A. Tax 17/2017 is from a

paragraph at page 226 of that judgment in which the learned Chief Justice

considered the question whether the time limit in Article 126(5) of the

Constitution, that,

(5) The Supreme Court shall hear and finally dispose of any petition or

reference under this Article within two months of the filing of such

petition or the making of such reference,

is mandatory or directory.

The Bench consisting of SAMARAKOON, Q.C., C.J., SARVANANDA, J.,

WANASUNDERA, J., WIMALARATNE, J., RATWATTE, J., SOZA, J.,

RANANSINGHE, J., ABDUL CADER J., AND RODRIGO, J., were however not

constituted to consider that question under Article 126(5) alone. There was a

much more important question to be decided by that Bench. It was,

whether the judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal

ceased to hold office in terms of the sixth amendment to the

Constitution?

The 06th Amendment which came into force on 08th August 1983 required that

the Judges must take the relevant oath before the President. As it appears in

the judgment of the learned Chief Justice,

This application was taken up for hearing by a Bench of Five judges of

this Court on 8th September, 1983. The argument was not concluded on

that day and was resumed on the next day. Counsel for the Petitioners

was making his submissions when one of my brother judges who was

reading a copy of the Act which had reached us two days earlier

brought it to my notice that the provisions of section 157A of the

Act contained a requirement that the judges of the Supreme Court

and the court of Appeal should take their oaths in terms of the

Seventh Schedule before the President which in fact had not been

done by any of the judges. The judges of both courts therefore

considered this matter and wrote to the President, inter alia that in their

opinion the period of one month expired at midnight on the same day

(i.e. the 9th September) and that they were thus prepared to take their

oaths. There was no reply from the President. However, I was informed

by the Minister of justice that he had contacted the president on this

matter and he had been told that the President had been advised by the

Attorney-General that the period of one month had expired on the 7th. In

13 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

the result no oath could be administered. On Monday the 12th I was

informed that the Courts of the supreme Court and Court of Appeal

and the Chambers of all judges had been locked and barred and

armed police guards had been placed on the premises to prevent

access to them. The judges had been effectively locked out.

On Monday the 12th September 1983 in a conversation with the Chief Justice

the Minister of Justice deprecated the act stating that he has not given such

instructions and by Tuesday the guards were withdrawn. Later in the course of

the argument in this case the learned Deputy Solicitor General Mr. Shibly Aziz

described it as an act of a blundering enthusiastic bureaucrat. He

apologized on behalf of the official and unofficial Bar. But on the last day of

hearing he withdrew the apology and substituted it instead with an expression

of regret. On the 15th the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal

received fresh letters of appointments commencing from that day. When the

Bench of Five Judges who heard this matter recommenced the hearing on 19th

from where it stopped on 09th the question that arose was whether the judges

ceased to hold office from 09th to 15th and S. Nadesan Q. C., who appeared for

the petitioner vehemently objected to proceedings de novo. This matter was

referred to a Bench of 09 Judges, as referred to above, which had to consider

whether it was mandatory for the judges to have taken their oath before the

President of the Republic.

The Scholar Dr. A. R. B. Amerasinghe, former Judge of the Supreme Court, in

his book The Supreme Court of Sri Lanka The First 185 Years describes

this incident, saying,

Two other major crises one involving the whole Supreme Court and

the Court of Appeal and the other involving the Chief Justice had to be

weathered before the first 185 years were completed.

The first was described by Chief Justice Samarakoon in Karthigesu

Vishvalingam and others vs. Don John Francis Liyanage and others,

S. C. Application No. 47 of 1983, as

a classic example of the uncertainties of litigation and the

vicissitudes of human affairs. The annals of the Supreme Court

do not record such a unique event and I venture to hope there

never will be such an event in the years to come. (page 97

98)

Dr. Amerasinghe added,

Why Deputy Solicitor General Shibley Aziz had to apologize on behalf of

the Bar when he had blamed an official is not clear. He was certainly a

better informed man when he decided to express regret rather than

apologize. He then knew that no member of the bureaucracy had called

in the Police, let alone having any intention of preventing the judges

from asserting their rights It was a timorous official of the Supreme

Court who had asked for Police protection. (page 101)

Whereas one who is interested in the details of this episode, which was, with

profound respect to the learned Chief Justice, not unprecedented in the

annals of the Supreme Court may read Dr. Amersainghes aforesaid work; for

the information of the new generation of Judges and Lawyers, who perhaps do

not know about it, I venture to record here, that, when our first Chief Justice

Sir Codrington Edmund Carrington presided with one other Judge in the

court of equity, which became the Supreme Court of British Ceylon, Edmund

Henry Lushington, due to a dispute arose between the Court and the Army

due to the use of parade grounds in Fort, Major General David Douglas

Wemyss, the lieutenant governor of Ceylon ordered the closure of every

entrance into the Fort from 8 oclock in the morning till 12 noon or 1 p.m.,

ostensibly on security reasons, which disrupted the Court and Wemyss, who

ranked in the protocol next to the Governor was summoned before the Court,

examined for eight hours and released on a recognizance of a hundred

thousand Rix dollars to keep the peace and to be in good behaviour for one

year. It was as a result of this incident, that, the Judges had to come to

Hulftsdorp from Fort. Incidentally, that too happened in the month of

September in the year 1804 on 24th. It is recorded, that, on 03rd October, when

Wemyss, the Commander of the Forces and Lieutenant Governor of Ceylon

appeared, in Court, surrounded by the officers of the Garrison and armed and

the ground around the Court and the Parade Ground were filled with soldiers

who were talking aloud, the Chief Justice having inquired of Wemyss what was

meant by so unusual an assemblage, added that if it was intended to

intimidate the Judges, not all the guns at the Garrison levelled at their

Lordships would have that effect. The Commander disclaimed such intentions

and orders were given forthwith to the soldiers to disperse and keep the peace.

The Crier of the Court was directed to proclaim the order that no one was to

remain in the Court premises with their swords or bayonets, on which order

there was compliance by all including the General and his suite1. (Dr.

Amerasinghe at page 459)

Although C. A. Tax 27/2017 referred to the decision of the learned Chief

Justice in regard to the effect of Article 126(5) of the Constitution, this Court is

of the view now that the 09 Bench judgment of Visuvalingam and others vs.

Liyanage and others was referred to in C. A. Tax 17/2017 and as the learned

1 I know that one might question the relevance of this passage. But having quoted Chief Justice Samarakoon in Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage, 1983, that it was the first time such an incident took place I only thought it is appropriate to relate this story from the time of Ceylons First Chief Justice and the profundity and splendor of that incident, as I think, if included in a foot note will be an insult to the great foundations on which the Supreme Court of this country is built. Dr. Amersinghe describes this incident in his above book from page 446 onwards as Coming to Hulftsdorp. I myself had alluded to this episode in my Article Legend, Legacy and Lucence of Hulftsdorp published in the Judges Journal in September 2017 and also used as the introduction to the self running PowerPoint presentation I prepared under the title Judiciarys Decade of Resurgence 1999 2009, which was shown to a gathering of Judges and other distinguished guests at function held to commemorate the services rendered by the then incumbent Chief Justice in a renowned Hotel in the Fort of Colombo on the evening of 16th May 2009. The Original source of this episode is The Ceylon Law Review.

Chief Justice who wrote the lead judgment of the majority of the Judges said at

page 214 that The principle of interpretation that govern ordinary law are

equally applicable to the provisions of a Constitution, it is pertinent to also

consider the basis of the decision of the majority of the Judges, as envisaged

from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice as to how it was interpreted

that the requirement of taking the oath before the President himself was not

mandatory.

It must also be noted, that, according to the judgment of the learned Chief

Justice the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal have taken

their oath before another Judge of the same Court well before the deadline.

As the judgment said,

Each of the Judges of the Supreme Court took the oath set out in the

Seventh Schedule to the Bill before another Judge of the Supreme Court.

Similarly each of the Judges of the Court of Appeal took the said oath

before another Judge of the same Court. At this juncture I might mention

that the Judges of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal are ex officio

J. Ps. in terms of section 45 of the Judicature Act. The oaths of the

Judges of the Court of Appeal were taken on dates prior to the 4th

September, 1983, and the oaths of the Judges of the Supreme Court

were taken before- 31st August, 1983. They were all well within the time

limit of one month stipulated in the Bill and the Act. (page 209)

To appreciate the full effect of this judgment one must also know about Articles

107(4), 157A, 165(1) and 169(12) of the Constitution.

Article 107(4) provided that a person appointed as a Judge of the Supreme

Court or a Judge of the Court of Appeal shall not enter upon the duties of his

office until he takes and subscribes or makes and subscribes before the

President, the required oath or the affirmation.

17 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Article 157A was the one prohibiting support, espouse, promote, finance,

encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State. Its sub Article

(07) imposed the requirement of taking the oath prescribed in the 07th

Schedule and that included those who were required to take an oath or

affirmation under Article 107 too. Article 157A at the end of sub Article (07)

said,

The provisions of Article 165 and Article 169(12) shall mutatis

mutandis, apply to, and in relation to, any person or officer who fails to

take and subscribe, or make and subscribe an oath or affirmation as

required by this paragraph.

It was Article 165(1) that provided, among other things, that,

Any such public officer, judicial officer, person or holder of an

office failing to take and subscribe such oath or make and

subscribe such affirmation after the commencement of the

Constitution on or before such date as may be prescribed by the

Prime Minister by Order published in the Gazette shall cease to be

in service or hold office.

Therefore in considering the question, whether the failure of the Judges to take

and subscribe their oath or affirmation before the President attracts the

sanction set out in Article 165 and thereby they ceased to hold office, (page

214) since the learned Deputy Solicitor General contended that it was

mandatory to do so, the learned Chief Justice considered the meaning and

the application of the term mutatis mutandis.

As stated at page 216, the learned Deputy Solicitor General,

submitted that the mutation must be done in this manner delete all

the words in Article 165(1) except the words "failing to take and

subscribe such oath or make and subscribe such affirmation" and the

18 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

words "shall cease to be in service or hold office" and for those words that

have been deleted substitute the words "Any such person or officer". So

that the mutation results in the following article

"Any such person or officer failing to take and subscribe such oath or

make and subscribe such affirmation shall cease to be in service or hold

office."

[In the reproduction of the part of Article 165(1) above in bold print these words

are italicized]

The learned Chief Justice said, (at page 216)

I cannot agree. This is not a mutation but a mutilation of Article

165. The major part of Article 165(1) is thereby abandoned. Mutatis

mutandis means "with necessary alterations in point of detail"

(Wharton's Law Lexicon)

On this basis, the learned Chief Justice concluded (at page 220) that, the

mutanda from Article 165 to Article 157A are,

(01) The oath,

(02) The time limit and

(03) The sanction, i.e., the loss of office.

His Lordship added,

There is nothing else that could be considered. The person before

whom the oath is to be taken finds no place in the provisions of Article

165(l). It is found only in Article 157A.

With profound respect, it appears that the reference to the President was in

Article 107(4). In any event it is not in Article 165(1) which was applicable

mutatis mutandis.

19 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

So that was the basis on which the majority view in Visuvalingam vs.

Liyanage decided that it was not mandatory to take the oath before the

President. The term mutanda was used by Justice Parinda Ranasinghe at

page 265 where His Lordship said that he gathered the case Tourial vs.

Minister of Internal Affairs Southern Rhodesia (1946) S. A. L. R. (A. D.)

535,544, in which the phrase mutatis mutandis was considered from the

judgment of the learned Chief Justice (at page 216). Justice Ranasinghe

dissented with the majority view in his judgment of erudition.

It is true that Articles 157A and 165(1) spelled out sanctions of not following

their provisions. There was no question before the Supreme Court about the

mandatory nature of those Articles. The question was whether the oath must

be taken before the President and no other. The majority of the Court decided it

was not so on the basis of the phrase mutatis mutandis used in sub Article

(07) of Article 175A.

Therefore what this Court wants to emphasize is that the basis of the

majority decision of the Supreme Court that the requirement to take the

oath before the President was not mandatory was not to validate the

proceedings of the Supreme Court in the case Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage

taken before the court on 08th and 09th September 1983, on a purported

principle that when a Court, tribunal or any public authority had to follow

a direction in a statute (here there was a time limit to take the oath as

well as a manner of doing it) it is directory but not mandatory, but on the

construction of Articles 165(1) and 157A in terms of the phrase mutatis

mutandis.

It must be also noted, that, the learned Chief Justice based His Lordships

decision on the phrase mutatis mutandis upon the Indian case of Motilal vs.

Commissioner of Income Tax, A. I. R. 1951 Nagpur 224, which His Lordship

considered at length and in detail from page 217 to 220.

20 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

In that case the Court was called upon to apply certain Rules of the Income

Tax Appellate Tribunal of Bombay mutatis mutandis to the provisions of

section 66 of the Income Tax Act of 1922.

The said section, which is also quoted, in part, in the judgment of

Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage at page 218, is as follows, in full,

66. Statement of case by Appellate Tribunal to High Court.[(1)

Within sixty days of the date upon which he is served with notice of an

order under sub-section (4) of section 33 the assessee or the

Commissioner may, by application in the prescribed form, accompanied

where application is made by the assessee by a fee of one hundred

rupees, require the Appellate Tribunal to refer to the High Court any

question of law arising out of such order, and the Appellate Tribunal

shall within ninety days of the receipt of such application draw up a

statement of the case and refer it to the High Court:

As it could be observed, the time limit of 60 days applied to the assessee as

well as to the Commissioner and notwithstanding the application of Rules 07

and 08 mutatis and mutandis, the Court upheld the plea in bar when the

application requiring the Tribunal to refer to the matter to the High Court was

received on the 63rd day.

Motilal Hiralal vs. Commissioner of Income Tax Central Province and

Berar, Nagpur A. I. R. (38) 1951 Nagpur 224, was decided by Hidayatullah J.

and Kaushalendra J. and the judgment was authored by the former.

Mohammad Hidayatullah2 was later the Chief Justice of India, vice president of

India and also the President of India. He was appointed as Additional Judge of

the High Court at Nagpur in 1946.

The learned Judge decided,

The section speaks of sixty days, and the starting point is certain and

there can be no dispute. Since the application under section 66(1) is to

require the Tribunal to refer a case the obvious construction is that the

requiring must be within 60 days. Now a person is required to do

something only when he knows of it and not while the letter is lying in a

post office unknown to him. The Tribunal is required to refer the

questions when the application reaches the Tribunal and not before. The

sub section nowhere uses the phrase require by an application made

within 60 days, which has been expounded in the Orissa High Court.

The sub section read grammatically means only that the Tribunal must

be required within 60 days to refer the questions, and then the

Tribunal must within 90 days make the reference. There is really no

hiatus [a pause] between terminus ad quem [the point at which

2Mohammad Hidayatullah OBE (pronunciation; 17 December 1905 18 September 1992) was the 11th Chief Justice of India serving from 25 February 1968 to 16 December 1970, and the sixth vice president of India, serving from 31 August 1979 to 30 August 1984. He had also served as the acting president of India from 20 July 1969 to 24 August 1969 and from 6 October 1982 to 31 October 1982 and from 25 July 1983 to 25 July 1983 and from 25 July 1984 to 25 July 1984.[1] He is regarded as an eminent jurist, scholar, educationist, author and linguist.[2][3]

. On 12 December 1942, he was appointed Government Pleader in the High Court at Nagpur. On 2 August 1943, he became the Advocate General of Central Provinces and Berar (now Madhya Pradesh) and continued to hold the said post till he was appointed as an Additional Judge of that High Court in 1946. He had the distinction of being the youngest Advocate General of an Indian state, Madhya Pradesh.[2][9]

something ends] of the limitation for applications and the terminus a quo

[starting point] of the 90 days in which the reference has to be made. For

this second period the terminus a quo [starting point] is also the receipt

of the application. The section, in my opinion, is quite clear and does not

admit of any other construction. (page 225 226)

The learned Judge Mohammad Hidayatullah concluded his judgment saying,

In my opinion even the Tribunal cannot by rules extend the period

and the remedy is only with the legislature as was pointed out by Chagla

C. J., in the Bombay case referred to above. I agree with the Bombay

Chief Justice that some amendment is absolutely necessary, but till that

is done Courts must give effect to the law as it stands.

Beneficial construction has its own limitations. An argument um ab

inconvenients [the Latin phrase argumentum ab inconvenienti refers to

an argument that draws its force from the inconvenience or other

undesirable consequences of the available alternatives ] is only to be

resorted to when the law is ambiguous. Otherwise as was stated by

Bohde J., in this Court in Gulabsinghe vs. Nathu Ram, I. L. R. (1944)

Nagpur 419 at page 421 : (A. I. R. (31) 1944 Nagpur 145) :

Courts have not been given power to devise their own

technique for saving claims from the bar which the statute of

limitation create.

This also follows from the observations of their Lordships of the Privy

Council in General Accident Fire and Life Assurance Corporation Ltd., vs.

Janmahomed, I. L. R. (1941) Bombay 203 at page 208: (A. I. R. (28) 1941

The learned Judge Mohammad Hidayatullah making the above statements in a

tax case and also in respect of something the Tribunal was required to do

makes His Lordships interpretation more significant.

According to the judgment in Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage the above decision

was approved and repeated in K. M. Works vs. Income Tax Commissioner,

A. I. R. 1953 Punjab 300.

Before considering the impact of the majority view in Visuvalingama vs.

Liyanage on the nature of Article 126(5) of the Constitution, which the Court of

Appeal in C. A. Tax 17/2017 applied in respect of section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission in full force, so to say, it is pertinent to refer to the decision of the

Supreme Court in the Special Determination pertaining to the Amendment to

the Tax Appeals Commission Act in 2013.

In that Special Determination made by the incumbent Chief Justice and two

other Justices of the Supreme Court, under the Sub Heading The Bill seeks

to fill in lacunae, the Supreme Court said,

The Tax Appeals Commission was created under the Tax Appeals

Commission Act No. 23 of 2011. Appeals that were pending under the

Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006, the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of

2002, Nation Building Tax Act No. 09 of 2009 and the Economic Service

Charge Act No. 13 of 2006 stood removed by operation of law to the

newly created Tax Appeals Commission.

However, the Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979 and the Inland

Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000 had not been included. This left a lacunae in

the law because, there were indeed tax appeals arising out of these two

statutes which ought to have stood removed to the Tax Appeals

Commission which was now the exclusive body created for the hearing of

tax appeals. As the respondent submitted, Clause 07 amends section 10

of the principal enactment and provides for the lacunae in the law in

24 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

relation to appeals from the Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979 and

Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000.

Clause 07 seeks to clarify the period of time given to the Commission to

determine the appeal by stating as follows:-

Two hundred and seventy days from the date of the

commencement of the sittings for the hearing of such appeal.

Clause 07 also inserts a proviso which provides that all appeals pending

before the respective Board or Boards of review in terms of the provisions

of the respective enactments shall with effect from the date of operation

of this Act, be deemed to stand transferred to the Commission and the

Commission shall notwithstanding any provision contained in any other

written law, make its determination within twenty four months of the

date on which the Commission shall commence its sittings for the

hearing of each such appeal.

According to what the Supreme Court said the Tax Appeals Commission was

established in respect of appeals under four Acts, viz., 10 of 2006, 14 of 2002,

09 of 2009 and 13 of 2006 dealing with taxes. The two later additions referred

to in the Special Determination are also two former Acts of Inland Revenue,

viz., 28 of 1979 and 38 of 2000. The above are all in respect of determinations

made by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue.

However it is also seen, that, whereas under section 7(1)(a) of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act a person aggrieved by the decision of the Commissioner

General of Inland Revenue can appeal; under section 7(1)(b) a person aggrieved

by the decision of the Director General of Customs under section 10 (1A) of the

Customs Ordinance also can appeal. This matter was also raised in the above

Special Determination.

It was said,

25 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner contended that

Clause 04 of the Bill is discriminatory and thus offends Article 12 of the

Constitution in that appellants who are aggrieved by a determination

under the newly created section 10(1A) of the Customs Ordinance of the

Director General of Customs and an appellant aggrieved by a

determination of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue are

treated differently.

The grouse of the learned Presidents Counsel was that whereas an appellant

appealing against a decision of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

must deposit either 10% of the tax determined as payable which is non

refundable or an equivalent of 25% Bank guarantee which shall remain valid

until the appeal is determined by the Commission, there was no such

requirement in respect of an appellant appealing against a decision of the

Director General of Customs. It was argued that this is a violation of Article

12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution.

The argument of the respondent was that differential treatment is indeed

required in law because the persons [aggrieved by a decision of the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue and aggrieved by a decision of the

Director General of Customs] are not similarly or identically placed.

The Supreme Court said,

The Court would emphasize the inherent principle of classification

which is germane to Article 12 of the Constitution and this Court has

time and again adverted to it Perera vs. Building Materials Corporation

(2007) BLR 59 and Dayawathie and others vs. Dr. M. Fernando and

others (1988) 1 SLR 371.

It is ingrained in Article 12(1) of the Constitution that the state is

allowed to classify persons or things for legitimate purposes.

26 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

However as referred to earlier, the Court decided that the time limit of Two

Hundred and Seventy Days from the date of commencement of sittings for the

hearing of such appeal can apply to both sets of appellants without

discrimination and, as referred to above, it said,

This only clarifies the terminal dates of the time limit and it is crystal

clear that such provisions cannot be violative of any of the provisions of

the Constitution.

In this backdrop it is pertinent to consider the second question considered in

Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage whether the requirement under Article 126(5) of

the Constitution is mandatory or directory.

In C. A. Tax 17/2017 the Court of Appeal reproduced only a part of the

passage in which the learned Chief Justice considered this question

commencing from page 226 of the judgment of Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage.

But the learned Chief Justice started to consider this question at page 225 and

to quote it in full it said,

Before I deal with the preliminary issues I desire to deal with the issue

raised on the time limit of two months set out in Article 126(5) which

states that the Supreme Court "Shall hear and finally dispose of any

petition or reference within two months of the filling of such petition or

the making of such reference". The Deputy Solicitor General

submitted that this provision was mandatory so that even a fault of

the Court is no excuse. An examination of the relevant provisions of the

Constitution indicates that this provision is merely directory.

Fundamental Rights are an attribute of the Sovereignty of the

People. The constitution commands that they "Shall be respected,

secured and advanced by all the organs of Government and shall not be

abridged, restricted or denied save in the manner and to the extent

(thereinafter) provided" (Article 4(d)). It is one of the inalienable rights of

27 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Sovereignty (Article 3). By Article 17 every person is given the right to

apply to the Supreme Court to enforce such right against the

executive provided the complains to Court within one month of the

infringement or threatened infringement (Article 126). These

provisions confer a right on the citizen and a duty on the Court.If

that right was intended to be lost because the Court fails in its duty the

constitution would so have provided. It has provided no sanction of any

kind in case of such failure. To my mind it was only an injunction to be

respected and obeyed but fell short of punishment if disobeyed. I am of

opinion that the provisions of Article 126(5) are directory and not

mandatory. Any other construction would deprive a citizen of his

fundamental right for no fault of his.While I can read into the

constitution a duty on the Supreme Court to act in a particular way I

cannot read into it any deprivation of a citizen's guaranteed right due to

circumstances beyond his control.

The above passage says, at least, 05 things and they are,

(i) that Fundamental Rights are an attribute of the Sovereignty of the

People,

(ii) that By Article 17 every person is given the right to apply to the

Supreme Court to enforce such right against the executive,

(iii) that These provisions confer a right on the citizen and a duty on

the Court,

(iv) that If that right was intended to be lost because the Court fails in its

duty the constitution would so have provided,

(v) that Any other construction would deprive a citizen of his

fundamental right for no fault of his.

28 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

In applying the above passage to the time limit in section 10 of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, in full force, so to say, the Court of Appeal in C. A. Tax

17/2017 said, that,

Although the above case was one involving of a fundamental right, the

logic of the reasoning of Samarakoon C. J., is compelling and applicable

to the present case as well. In terms of section 8(1) of the Tax Appeals

Commission Act, it is only a person who is aggrieved by the

determination of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue in relation

to the imposition of any tax, levy, charge, duty or penalty or the Director

General of Customs under subsection (1B) of section 10 of the Customs

Ordinance who can prefer an appeal to the Tax Appeals Commission.

Section 9(10) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act allows the Tax Appeals

Commission on appeal to confirm, reduce, increase or annul, as the case

may be, the assessment determined by the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue or to remit the case to the Director General of Customs.

The Tax Appeals Commission Act does not spell out any sanction for the

failure on the part of the Tax Appeals Commission to comply with the

time limit set out in section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act. If the

appellant is correct in submitting that the time bar on the Tax Appeals

Commission is mandatory, it will result in the validity of the impugned

determination made by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

been maintained for no fault of the aggrieved party where the Tax

Appeals Commission fails to adhere to the time limit. Such deprivation of

rights of the aggrieved party cannot be implied in the absence of clear

and unambigouous statutory provisions.

Therefore the Court of Appeal commenced applying the passage from the

judgment in Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage saying, Although the above case was

one involving of a fundamental right, the Court, it appears, took for granted,

29 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

that, both situations are similar or identical. It is the position of this Court that

it is not so due to following reasons.

If a citizen whose fundamental right has been violated does not do anything he

cannot assert that right and obtain a remedy for the infringement. It needs

adjudication for it to come in to existence as a right. If he makes an application

the Supreme Court has to adjudicate it and if the time limit obstructs the

Supreme Court from doing it, the citizen is deprived of his right to get his

fundamental right adjudicated.

On the other hand, under the system of self assessment of income tax by

a citizen prevalent under the law on Income Tax, a citizen has been

conferred with a right to pay the amount of tax he assesses, unless and

until he is deprived of doing so by the assessor rejecting his self

assessment. But it does not stop at the assessor under the law. From

there it goes to the Commissioner General and to the Tax Appeals

Commission. This is the end of it as far as the disputing (or not disputing)

of the self assessment is concerned. Can anyone dispute this simple

argument? The answer is no, because from the Tax Appeals Commission

onwards there lies no appeal either by the citizen (taxpayer) or the

Commissioner General on the factual dispute on the self assessment.

What goes up from the Tax Appeals Commission up to this Court is only a

Case Stated on Questions of Law. What goes up from there to the Supreme

Court is only an appeal which assesses the correctness or otherwise of the

answers given by this Court to those Questions of Law.

In fact, unlike in the Fundamental Rights case, there is no adjudication at any

stage either by a Court or a Tribunal or any other body, in whatever name it

may be called, in the sense of an exercise of judicial power under Articles 4(c)

30 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

and 105 of the Constitution3 on the factual dispute. Of course, the Court of

Appeal in resolving the Questions of Law exercises the judicial power under the

above articles. But this Court does not adjudicate the factual dispute. The

institutions below this Court, although decide on the factual dispute, do not

exercise judicial power. Although all exercise of judicial power decides a

question, all decisions in respect of questions does not involve the exercise of

judicial power.

In this regard, this Court would wish to consider what was said in the Privy

Council on 09th March 1967 in THE UNITED ENGINEERING WORKERS

UNION, Appellants,and K. W. DEVANAYAGAM (President, Eastern

ProvinceAgricultural Co-operative Union Ltd.), Respondent. The Privy council

consisted of Viscount Dilhorne, Lord Guest, Lord Devlin,Lord Upjohnand Lord

Pearson. The same way as the Supreme Court of Ceylon, the Privy Council too

was divided 03 to 02. The majority judgment delivered by Viscount Dilhorne,

with the concurrence of Lord Upjohn and Lord Pearson decided, that, the

President of a Labour Tribunal does not hold judicial office within the meaning

of section 55(5) of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order in Council of 1946. The

minority judgment of Lord Guest and Lord Devlin held, that, the orders of a

Labour Tribunal are judgments and not administrative orders.

Both the opinions accepted the view of Griffith C. J., in Huddart vs. Moorhead,

(1908) 8 C. L. R. 330 at 357.

The majority opinion said at page 293,

There is no single test that can be applied to determine whether a

particular office is a judicial one. In Labour Relations Board of

Saskatchewan v. John East Iron Works 2[(1949) A. C. 134.] the question

so, whether in that exercise it was a tribunal analogous to a superior,

district or county court. Lord Simonds, delivering the judgment of the

Board, stated that their Lordships without attempting to give a

comprehensive definition of judicial power, accepted the view that its

broad features were accurately stated by Griffiths C. J. in Huddart,

Parker & Co. Proprietary Ltd. v. Moorhead 3[(1908) 8 C. L. R. 330, 357.],

which was approved by the Privy Council in Shell Co. of Australia Ltd. v.

Federal Commissioner of Taxation 4[(1931) A. C. 275.]. Lord Simonds

went on to say at. page 149 :

" Nor do they doubt, as was pointed out in the latter case, that

there are many positive features which are essential to the

existence of judicial power, yet by themselves are not conclusive of

it, or that any combination of such features will fail to establish a

judicial power if, as is a common characteristic of so-called

administrative tribunals, the ultimate decision may be determined

not merely by the application of legal principles to ascertained

facts but by considerations of policy also."

The minority opinion said at page 306,

The accepted definition of judicial power is that given by Griffiths C.J.

in Huddart v. Moorhead 1[(1908) 8 C. L. R. 330 at 357.]. It is the power

"which every Sovereign Authority must of necessity have to decide

controversies between its subjects, or between itself and its

subjects, whether the rights relate to life, liberty, or property. The

exercise of this power does not begin until some tribunal which has

power to give a binding and authoritative decision (whether subject to

appeal or not) is called upon to take action. " The power of the Labour

Tribunal clearly falls within these general terms, but it is worth noting

some particular aspects of it.

32 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

There must be a controversy about rights or, as it is sometimes put, a

Rs. Part IV A covers controversies between a workman and his employer

about the rights arising out of that relationship. The power of the

Tribunal is that of giving a binding and authoritative decision. In this

respect the procedure is to be distinguished from the conciliation

procedures provided under the Act.

The power proceeds from the Sovereign, i.e., it is the judicial power

of the State. In this respect it is to be distinguished from the power

of an arbitrator whose authority is derived from the consent of the

parties themselves. This factor-that it is the judicial power of the State-

carries with it another consequence. Justice can be done in an individual

case without creating any principle applicable to other cases of the same

sort. But the judicial power of the State is concerned with justice for all

and that is not attained if there are inexplicable differentiations between

decisions in the same type of case. The judicial power of the State must

therefore be exercised in conformity with principle. In Moses v. Parker

1[(1896) A. C. 245.] there was vested in the Supreme Court of Tasmania

jurisdiction to deal with disputes regarding claims to grants of land.

Such disputes had previously been dealt with by the Governor on the

report of Commissioners, the Governor being "in equity and good

conscience" entitled to make a grant. The statute which gave jurisdiction

to the Supreme Court provided that it should not be " bound by the strict

rules of law or equity in any case, or by any technicalities or legal forms

whatever". The Board held that a decision of the Supreme Court given

under the statute was not "a judicial decision admitting of appeal".

Explaining this case in the later case of C. P. R. Co. v. Corporation of City

of Toronto 2[(1911) A. C. 461.] the Board said at 471 that "as the

tribunal from which it was desired to appeal was expressly exonerated

from all rules of law or practice, and certain affairs were placed in the

33 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

hands of the judges as the persons from whom the best opinions might

be obtained, and not as a court administering justice between the

litigants, such functions do not attract the prerogative of the Crown to

grant appeals".

As History judges after 57 years from 19674, it appears, that, the minority

opinion, notwithstanding the fact that it had one judge less than that of the

majority, is sounder an opinion. After this case in 1967, the Presidents of

Labour Tribunals were come to be appointed by the Judicial Service

Commission.

The minority, also at page 309 went on to quote the following from the dicta of

Isaacs and Rich JJ., in Waterside Workers Federation of Australia vs.

Alexander (J. W.) Ltd., (1918) 25 C. L. R. 434 at 463, that,

The essential difference is that the judicial power is concerned

with the ascertainment, declaration and enforcement of the rights

and liabilities of the parties as they exist, or are deemed to exist, at

the moment the proceedings are instituted; whereas the function of

the arbitral power in relation to industrial disputes is to ascertain and

declare, but not enforce, what in the opinion of the arbitrator ought to be

the respective rights and liabilities of the parties in relation to each

other."

At the same page, the dissenting lordships of the Privy Council said,

"Another and essential characteristic of judicial power is that it

should be exercised judicially. Put another way, judicial power is

power limited by the obligation to act judicially. Administrative or

executive power is not limited in that way. Judicial action requires as a

minimum the observance of some rules of natural justice. Exactly

4 John F. Kennedy said in his inaugural speech, History, the final judge

what these are will vary with the circumstances of the case as Tucker

L.J. said in Russell v. Duke of Norfolk 3[(1949) 1 A. E. R. 109 at 118.] in

a passage which has several times been approved. Whatever standard is

adopted, Tucker L.J. said, one essential is that the person concerned

should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case. Lord

Hodson in Ridge v. Baldwin 4[(1964) A. C. 40 at 132.], after quoting

Tucker L.J'.s dictum, added :-"No one, I think, disputes that three

features of natural justice stand out(1) the right to be heard by an

unbiased tribunal; (2) the right to have notice of charges of

misconduct; (3) the right to be heard in answer to those charges.

"These are not necessarily features of administrative decisions. The

administrator is not required to be unbiased and his decision may often

affect those who have no opportunity of presenting their views.Under s.

31C (2) the Labour Tribunal is empowered, subject to regulations

which have not yet been made, itself to lay down the procedure to

be observed by it. We think it is clear from the authorities, indeed,

the contrary was not suggested-that the nature of its enquiry is

such that it must act in conformity with natural justice. A recent

example of the applicability of the rules in this type of case is R. v.

Deputy Industrial Injuries Commissioner ex parte Moore 1[(1964) A. C.

40 at 132. (1965) 1 Q. B. 456 at 476.]. It is arguable that the rules of

natural justice are not applicable at all unless there is an obligation

to act judicially and that if such a limitation is imposed on the

power, it must be a judicial power. Parker C.J. said recently in re.

Habib Khan that it may be that where there is no duty to act judicially or

quasi-judicially there is no power in the Court to interfere. But the point

was not explored in argument before the Board and we shall not

therefore say more than that to hold that the Labour Tribunal is bound

by the rules of natural justice is going a long way towards holding that it

is a judicial tribunal.

The minority opinion quoted from page 309 and especially the highlighted parts

show, that, Labour Tribunals exercise judicial power. It is a recognition of this,

that, the Presidents, Labour Tribunals come to be appointed by the Judicial

Service Commission.

Neither the assessor nor the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue are

acting judicially. A minimum requirement of the exercise of judicial power, as

Lord Hodson identified in Ridge vs. Baldwin (1964) A. C. 40, the right to be

heard by an unbiased tribunal, is not available with the assessor or the

Commissioner General. They are officers appointed to collect revenue and not

uninterested institutions exercising judicial power. Their decisions are either

purely administrative or at the very least (even though there could be a

semblance of acting judicially) tainted with administrative considerations of

policy. An exercise of judicial power cannot be so influenced. Under section 2(2)

of the Tax Appeals Commission Act although a kind of judicial flavour is added

to the Tax Appeals Commission by the appointment of retired judges of the

Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal not only that the Commission comprises

of persons who have wide knowledge of, and have gained eminence in the

fields of Taxation, Finance and Law,. but also since they are appointed not

by the Judicial Service Commission or the Head of the State but by the

minister of finance, the Commission is not a court or tribunal that exercises

judicial power. In the above case of THE UNITED ENGINEERING WORKERS

UNION, Appellants, and K. W. DEVANAYAGAM there was no doubt in the

opinions of the majority or the minority of judges, that, a tribunal appointed by

a minister would not exercise judicial power.

But in a Fundamental Right application the alleged infringement of a

fundamental right or the language right is adjudicated under Article 126 by the

highest court of the land under Article 105(1)(a) the Supreme Court of the

Republic of Sri Lanka. The learned Chief Justice in Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage

said,

36 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

While I can read into the constitution a duty on the Supreme Court to

act in a particular way I cannot read into it any deprivation of a citizen's

guaranteed right due to circumstances beyond his control.

So, 09 Judges of the Supreme Court, on the strength of Article 126(5) of the

Constitution, which was added to the Constitution by the legislature in the

exercise of a part of sovereignty, but not otherwise, decided, that, they can

read into the constitution a duty on the Supreme Court to act in a particular

way. But the Supreme Court said, that, it will not do so to deprive a citizens

guaranteed right due to circumstances beyond his control. Because, the

citizens guaranteed right required adjudication, the Court did not hold

that the time limit was mandatory. But here, the citizen has been

conferred a right to pay on his self assessment unless and until it is

validly disputed. If it needed adjudication under the Constitution it could have

been done only in terms of Article 4(c) and 105. Adjudication cannot be done

otherwise since the Preamble to the Constitution enunciates INDEPENDENCE

OF THE JUDICIARY as an intangible heritage that guarantees the dignity and

well being of succeeding generations of the People of Sri Lanka which includes

tax payers. His Lordship Kanagasabapathy J. Sripavan, Chief Justice in the

course of His Lordships determination on the 19th Amendment to the

Constitution said that the Preamble is a part of the Constitution. It is a long

standing principle too. In The London County Council vs. The Bermondsey

Bioscope Company Limited, 08th and 09th December 1910, [1911] 1 K. B. 445, C.

A. Russell K. C. for the cinema argued, that, The title of the Act is part of

the Act: Fielding vs. Morley Corporation [1899] 1 Ch. 1.

Section 163(3) of Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 comes under Chapter XXII

on Assessments. That section says,

37 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

(3) Where a person has furnished a return of income, the Assessor or

Assistant Commissioner may in making an assessment on such person

under subsection (1) or under subsection (2), either

(a) accept the return made by such person; or

(b) if he does not accept the return made by that person, estimate the

amount of the assessable income of such person and assess him

accordingly:

It may be noted, that, the term used in section 163(3)(b) is not rejection but

does not accept. It is because under section 163(3)(a) there is a right

accrued to the citizen to pay according to his self assessment, unless he is

deprived of that right. If the self assessment is accepted under section

163(3)(a) that is the end of the matter and no other process commences.

The process of the deprivation of this right commences at section 163(3)(b)

where the Assessor or the Assistant Commissioner must estimate the amount

of the assessable income of the citizen.

The Assessor or the Assistant Commissioner under section 163(3)(b) is not an

independent body such as a Court or a Tribunal or other institution under

Article 4(c) and Article 105. He is the one who started the dispute of disputing

the tax payers self assessment. It could be that a particular tax payer on

receiving an intimation of non acceptance of the self assessment may make

representations to the Assessor or to the Assistant Commissioner and the latter

accepts the position of the tax payer. This position which was succinctly

explained by Justice Victor Perera in Ismail vs. Commissioner of Inland

Revenue (1981) 2 SLR 78 was considered by me in ACL Polymers (Pvt)

Limited vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, C. A. Tax 09/2023

decided on 09.12.2022. In the same judgment the case of D. M. S. Fernando

vs. Mohideen Ismail, the appeal of the above case to the Supreme Court was

also considered. From the decision of the Assessor or the Assistant

Commissioner the tax payer appeals to the Commissioner General, who is the

superior of the former. The contest is between the self assessment and the

estimate prepared by his subordinate officer. Before the Tax Appeals

Commission too, the only appellant is the taxpayer as the Commissioner

General was the decision maker. The Commissioners, although they include

retired Judges of the Superior Courts because the legislature in establishing

the Tax Appeals Commission in 2011 wanted it to consist of non tax officers as

well, are neither appointed by the Head of the State or the Judicial Service

Commission, as done in Courts, Tribunals and other institutions under Articles

4(c) and 105 of the Constitution.

This is the reason why the citizens right to pay on the self assessment

gets only suspended but not vitiated when disputed by the assessor and

the Commissioner General. That process of disputing the citizens self

assessment culminates at the Tax Appeals Commission. From Tax Appeals

Commission upwards what is considered are only questions of law but not

facts. So if the process of disputing the self assessment cannot be

completed according to law and as required by the law, should not the

right of self assessment prevail?

It appears to this Court, that, to decide otherwise is the naked usurpation of

the legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation. Why not

if a gap is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act, as Viscount

Simonds said when he castigated Denning L. J.?

Taxes are required for the maintenance of a welfare government. But the days

that considered that all time limits are for the citizen and not for the official,

unfortunately for some, are at an end. The officialdom and bureaucracy, which

are remnants of feudalism are taking their due place on the face of Sovereign

People in other parts of the world too. Despite the citizen under the

Constitutional Monarchy in Great Britain is called a subject in Sadiq Ahmed

vs. The Commissioners for Her Majestys Revenue and Customs [2020]

UKFTT (United Kingdom First tier Tribunal) 337 (TC) allowed the taxpayers

appeal against a penalty for failing to comply with an information notice

because the penalty notice was not issued within 12 months of the taxpayer

becoming liable to a penalty and HMRC could not refresh the time period by

issuing a subsequent information notice. Judge Anne Redston decided,

I considered whether HMRC had the power to extend that twelve

month time limit by the simple device of issuing a new notice which

repeated the text of the out of time notice. It is clear that the answer to

that question must be no. It would entirely defeat the purpose of the

statutory provision.

It was stated above as to why Chief Justice N. D. M. Samarakoon Q. C.s

decision regarding a Fundamental Rights application cannot apply here. If the

Court extends time, without the statute giving power to do so, it will be a clear

violation of the law.

The article Managing Income Tax compliance through Self Assessment,

by Andrew Okello dated 11th March 2014 published in IMF eLibrary5 says,

among other things, the following,

B. Self-assessment Implementation

12. The self-assessment system accepts the reality that no tax

administration has, or ever will have, sufficient resources to

determine the correct liability of every taxpayer. It also recognizes

that taxpayers themselveswith appropriate assistance from the tax

departmentare in the best position to determine their tax liabilities,

given that they have first-hand knowledge of their business affairs and

financial transactions, and have ready access to underlying accounting

records.

13. Self-assessment is based on the idea of voluntary compliance. In

a self-assessment system, taxpayers calculate and pay their own taxes

without the intervention of a tax official. If this is not done appropriately

and within the prescribed timeframes, the tax administration detects this

failure and takes appropriate enforcement action, including applying the

penalties provided for in the law. Tax administrations generally accept

tax returns at face value (i.e. not subjected to technical scrutiny) at the

time of filing, at which time the tax due is paid. Some simple checks may

be performed; however, the focus is to ensure arithmetical accuracy and

that the taxpayer has completed the appropriate items on the tax return

form.

..

17. Internationally, there has been a steady movement towards self-

assessment and away from administrative assessment

practices. Self-assessment for tax purposes is not a new phenomenon.

Canada and the United States first implemented self-assessment in the

1910s, followed by Japan in 1947 (Loo et al., 2005). In the last 30 years,

however, the spread of self-assessment for income tax has been a

common phenomenonSri Lanka (1972), Pakistan (1979), Bangladesh

(1981), Indonesia (1984), Australia (1986-87), Ireland (1988), New

Zealand (1988) and the United Kingdom (UK) in 1996-97 (Noor et al.,

2013). Presently, around half (18) of revenue bodies in the OECD, for

example, apply self-assessment principles for the PIT while 22 apply self-

assessment for CIT (OECD, 2013).

This position is further explained by what was debated in the parliament at the

second and third readings of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011,

which is referred to below.

decision, therefore, draws its peculiar quality of justice, soundness

and profoundness from the particular facts and conditions of the

case which it has presumed to adjudicate. In order, therefore, that

this quality may be rendered with the highest measure of

accuracy, it sometimes becomes necessary to expressly limit its

application to the peculiar set of circumstances out of which

it springs.

Hence, the authority of the precedent depends upon, and is limited to,

"the particular facts and conditions of the case" that the prior case

"presumed to adjudicate." Precedents, therefore, are not to be applied

blindly. The precedent must be analyzed carefully to determine whether

there exists a similarity of facts and issues, and to ascertain the actual

holding of the court in the prior case.

Therefore the words of Lord Simonds,

It appears to me to be a naked usurpation of the legislative function

under the thin disguise of interpretation,

must be traced to its origin, in that, to ascertain what were the factual

circumstances that made Lord Simonds say that in 1951.

The case Magor and St. Mellons Rural District Council vs. Newport

Corporation is reported in respect of its Court of Appeal decision in 1950 and

in respect of the House of Lords decision in 1951.

In the Court of Appeal decision at 1950 2 All E. R 1226 Denning L. J., (before

His Lordship became the Master of Rolls in 1962) dissented with Somervell and

Cohen JJ. The majority of the House of Lords, except Lord Radcliff, confirmed

the majority judgment of the Court of Appeal. Lord Simonds made a speech

only as a criticism of Denning L. J.s dissenting judgment in the lower court.

43 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

The facts of the dispute with regard to which both courts had dissenting

judgments are not very complicated. Although they are referred to in passing in

several of the speeches and judgments, Denning L. J., specifically said at page

1235 I confess that I find it difficult to deal with these questions of

interpretation in the abstract. I like to see their practical application and

for that reason I propose to set out hypothetical sets of facts which, I

suppose, are probably the true facts although they are not stated in the

Case. They are as follows,

The borough of Newport, Monmouthshire was rich and it brought more money

into the rates than it cost the rural district councils to look after them. By an

Act of Parliament in 1934 the boundaries of Newport were extended to new rich

grounds, out of the rural districts. If nothing was done about it, the rates in the

rural districts would have gone up. To remedy this the Parliament enacted,

that, Newport should pay compensation to the rural district councils. If the

amount could not be agreed the matter was referred to arbitration. By an order

of the Minister of Health in 1935, two rural districts, shorn as each was of its

rich grounds were amalgamated. They were previously Magor and St. Mellons

rural district councils separately. Now they were Magor and St. Mellons rural

district council together.

The arbitrator referred four questions in a Case stated. The first and second

questions are sufficient to appreciate the problem. They are (i) Whether the

rural council as successor of the former rural district councils or otherwise is

entitled to claim as against the borough council a financial adjustment under

section 58(1) of the Act of 1934 and the applied provisions of the Act of 1933 in

respect of the alteration of boundaries effected by Act of 1934? (ii) If the first

question is answered affirmatively, whether a claim for any increase of burden

within the meaning of section 152 of the Act of 1933 can lawfully be made by

the rural council?

Parker J., in the Divisional Court answered (i) in affirmative and (ii) in negative.

Cohen L. J., in the Court of Appeal at page 1231 said that Parker J., decided so

because he thought he was bound by the decision of Godstone Rural District

Council vs. Croydon Corporation (1932) 102 L. J. K. B. 34, to hold that he

must have regard only to the increase in burden during the period of the

continued existence of the old councils after the transfer of the added areas to

the borough council. That period was but a moment in time.

Later, in House of Lords at 1951 2 All E R 839 at 845 Lord Morton of

Henryton would say, In such a case, if the wealthier portion of the area is lost,

there is an increase of burden on the ratepayers in the area which remains and

section 151 and section 152 are directed to meeting such a case, The present

case is one in which each of two local authorities loses a wealthy portion

of its area and is abolished immediately after the loss occurs. It may well

be that, if the legislature had contemplated such a state of affairs, some special

provisions would have been inserted in the Act of 1933. What these provisions

would have been can only be a matter of guesswork.

Despite the majority in the House of Lords and the Court of Appeal

thinking, that, the amalgamation of Magor and St. Mellons would

extinguish their rights independently of each other they had to claim

compensation and what Parliament would have provided could only be a

matter of guesswork [Lord Simonds said at page 841, If a gap is

disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act] Denning L. J., was not

deceived by labels, Magor, St. Mellons and now Magor and St.

Mellons. He said,

I cannot think that the judge is right about this. The Ministers order

expressly provided that the property of the two rural district councils

the two councils to compensation was clearly Property which

vested in the combined council and the judge so held, but he

thought that the right was worth nothing because the two councils

only lived for a moment of time after they had been shorn off their

rich grounds. Much as I respect his opinions, I cannot agree with

him about this. The effect of the Ministers order was, if I may use a

metaphor, not the death of the two councils, but their marriage. The

burdens which each set of ratepayers had previously borne separately

became a combined burden to be borne by them all together. So, also,

the rights to which the two councils would have been entitled for each set

of ratepayers separately became a combined right to which the combined

council was entitled for them all together. This was so obviously the

intention of the Ministers order that I have no patience with an ultra

legalistic interpretation which would deprive them of their rights

altogether. I would repeat what I said in Seaford Court Estates Ltd.,

vs. Asher [1949] 2 All E. R. 155. We do not sit here to pull the

language of Parliament and Ministers to pieces and make nonsense

of it. That is an easy thing to do and it is a thing to which lawyers

are too often prone. We sit here to find out the intention of

Parliament and of Ministers and carry it out and we do this better by

filling in the gaps and making sense of the enactment than by

opening it up to destructive analysis. (page 1235,1236)

Section 151(1) of the Local Government Act of 1933, which was material said,

151.(1) Any public bodies affected by any alteration of areas or

authorities made by an order under this Part of this Act may from time

to time make agreements for the purpose of adjusting any property,

income, debts, liabilities and expenses (so far as affected by the

alteration) of, and any financial relations between, the partis to the

agreement.

In the simple, less legalistic and exalted way with unalloyed justice was to

consider the amalgamation as marriage, but not death8.

On that basis, one may consider the applicability and validity of what Lord

Simonds said, which is reproduced here in full.

My Lords, I have had the advantage of reading the opinion which my

noble and learned friend, Lord Morton of Henryton, is about to deliver

and I fully concur in his reasons and conclusion, as I do in those of

Parker J. and the majority of the Court of Appeal. Nor should I have

thought it necessary to add any observations of my own were it not that

the dissenting opinion of Denning L. J., appears to invite some comment.

My Lords, the criticism which I venture to make of the judgment of the

learned lord justice is not directed at the conclusion that he reached. It is

after all a trite saying that on questions of construction different minds

may come to different conclusions and I am content to say that I agree

with my noble and learned friend. But it is on the approach of the lord

justice to what is a question of construction and nothing else that I think

is desirable to make some comment, for at a time when so large a

proportion of the cases that are brought before the courts depend on the

construction of modern statutes it would not be right for this House to

pass unnoticed the propositions which the learned lord justice lays down

for the guidance of himself and, presumably, of others. He said: ([1950] 2

All E. R. 1236):

We sit here to find out the intention of Parliament and of

Ministers and carry it out and we do this better by filling in the

8 Despite both marriage and death introduce significant changes and discontinuities in peoples lives. In marriage, individuals transition from being single to being part of a couple, while in death, the transition is from life to whatever lies beyond. Both involve coming to terms with loss and adjusting to new realities. But Denning L. J., in his above statement used the conventional contrast between the concepts of marriage and death.

gaps and making sense of the enactment than by opening it up

to destructive analysis.

The first part of this passage appears to be an echo of what was said in

Heydons case (1584) 3 Co. Rep. 7a; 76 E. R. 637; 42 Digest 614, 143,

three hundred years ago and, so regarded, is not objectionable. But in a

way in which the learned lord justice summarisesthe broad rules laid

down by SIR EDWARD COKE in that case9 may well induce grave

misconception of the function of the court. The part which in the judicial

interpretation of a statute by reference to the circumstances of its

passing is too well known to need re statement. It is sufficient to say that

the general proposition that it is the duty of the court to find out the

intention of Parliament and not only of Parliament but of Ministers also

cannot by any means be supported. The duty of the court is to interpret

the words that the legislature has used. Those words may be ambiguous,

but, even if they are, the power and duty of the court to travel outside

them on a voyage of discovery are strictly limited: see, for instance,

Assam Railways & Trading Co., Ltd. vs. Inland Revenue Commissioners

[1935] A. C. 445 and particularly, the observations of LORD WRIGHT

[1935] A. C. 458.

The second part of the passage that I have cited from the judgment of the

learned lord justice is, no doubt, the logical sequel of the first. The court,

having discovered the intention of Parliament and Ministers too, must

proceed to fill in the gaps. What the legislature has not written, the court

must write. This proposition which re states in a new form the view

expressed by the lord justice in the earlier case of Seaford Court Estates

Ltd., vs. Asher [1949] 2 All E. R. 155, (to which the lord justice himself

refers) cannot be supported. It appears to me to be a naked usurpation

9 Sir Edward Coke did not write the judgment in Heydons case (1584). He became a Judge for the first time in 1585, the next year, when he was 33 years old. Hence Viscount Simonds argument is wrong on this aspect too.

of the legislative function under the thin disguise of interpretation

and it is the less justifiable when it is guesswork with what material

the legislature would, if it had discovered the gap, have filled it in. If

a gap is disclosed, the remedy lies in an amending Act. For the reasons

to be given by my noble and learned friend I am of opinion that this

appeal should be dismissed with costs.

In his self proclaimed criticism, Lord Simonds dividing into two parts what

Denning L. J., said in the Court of Appeal in the same case, sees its first part,

We sit here to find out the intention of Parliament and of Ministers and carry

it out, as an echo of what Sir Edward Coke said in Heydons case, decided in

1584. It is from Heydons case the rule in interpretation known as the mischief

rule is extracted. That rule applies in four parts, [Beginning of the

Quotation]

For the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they

penal or beneficial, restrictive or enlarging of the common law), four things

are to be discerned and considered:

(1st). What was the common law before the making of the Act?

(2nd). What was the mischief and defect for which the common law

did not provide.

(3rd). What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to

cure the disease of the commonwealth. And,

(4th). The true reason of the remedy; and then the office of all the

judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the

mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions

and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and pro

privatocommodo, and to add force and life to the cure and remedy,

according to the true intent of the makers of the Act, pro bono

publico10. [Emphasis added in this judgment]

[End of the Quotation]

Under the above rules, not only the court has to ascertain the remedy the

parliament has devised, the court must also discover the mischief or the defect

that was there. This covers the part of Denning L. J.s dictum that the court

must gather the intention of the Parliament or the Minister. That is especially

rules 02 and 03 above. But that is not all what the rules say. Rule 04 says,

the office of all the judges is always to make such construction as shall

suppress the mischief not only that, but to add force and life to the cure

and remedy. So the court must not only ascertain the intention of the

Parliament but also add force and life to the cure. This is, in other words, to

add force and life to the words in the statute. This was what Denning L. J., said

in the second part of his dictum as per Lord Simonds, as and we do this better

by filling in the gaps and making sense of the enactment. Hence, it appears

to this court, that, the rules laid down in Heydons case includes, not only

the first part which Denning L. J., said but also his second part, despite

Lord Simonds trying to confine the first part only to Heydons test (which

he says is not objectionable) and to isolate and attack to the second part

in his criticism.Therefore Denning L. J., said nothing new except what

was laid down in Heydons case in 1584. But people tend, not to see this

simple truth and to discard the echoing of Denning L. J., which was the

reverberation of Heydons rules and to cling on to the criticism of Lord

Simonds since it is a statement from the House of Lords. This is what

happens when the phrase, a naked usurpation of the legislative function

under the thin guise of interpretation alone is taken out of the context and

used.

If, the facts of Heydons case about 440 years ago is stated in a very simple

form, the religious college Ottery College leased a manor also called Ottery to

Ware the father and Ware the son for their lives. But it later leased the same

parcel to Heydon for eighty years. Suppression of Religious Houses Act of 1535

brought by Henry11 VIII dissolved many religious houses including the Ottery

College. The college lost its lands to the king. But a provision in the Act kept

alive any grant made more than an year before the enactment of the statute,

for a term of life. The Court of Exchequer found that the grant to the Wares is

valid whereas the grant to Heydon was not.

This judgment is available. Although the above rules were laid down in that

judgment, it cannot be a judgment of Sir Edward Coke, as claimed by Lord

Simonds and the popular belief because in 1584 Coke was not a Judge. Coke's

first judicial postings came under Elizabeth; in 1585, he was made Recorder of

Coventry, in 1587 Norwich, and in 1592 Recorder of London, a position he

resigned upon his appointment as Solicitor General. [Johnson, Cuthbert William

(1845). The Life of Sir Edward Coke. Vol. 1 (2nd ed.). Henry Colburn.]

Born on 01st February 1552, Coke was 32 years old in 1584. He was in his 33rd

year in 1585 when he became a Judge. The judgment says that the said rules

were the exposition of Sir Roger Manwood, Chief Baron, and the other

Barons of the Exchequer. The judgment says,

1. And the great doubt which was often debated at the Bar and Bench, on

this verdict, was, whether the copyhold estate of Ware and Ware for their

lives, at the will of the Lords, according to the custom of the said manor,

should, in judgment of law be called an estate and interest for lives,

within the said general words and meaning of the said Act. And after all

the Barons openly argued in Court in the same term, scil. Pasch. 26 Eliz.

and it was unanimously resolved by Sir Roger Manwood, Chief Baron,

and the other Barons of the Exchequer, that the said lease made to

Heydon of the said parcels, whereof Ware and Ware were seised for life by

copy of court-roll, was void; for it was agreed by them, that the said

copyhold estate was an estate for life, within the words and meaning of

the said Act. And it was resolved by them, that for the sure and

true interpretation of all statutes in general (be they penal or beneficial,

restrictive or enlarging of the common law,) four things are to be

discerned and considered:

1st. What was the common law before the making of the Act.

2nd. What was the mischief and defect for which the common law

did not provide.

3rd. What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to

cure the disease of the commonwealth.

And, 4th. The true reason of the remedy; and then the office of all the

Judges is always to make such construction as shall suppress the

mischief, and advance the remedy, and to suppress subtle inventions

and evasions for continuance of the mischief, and pro privatocommodo,

and to add force and life to the cure and remedy, according to the true

intent of the makers of the Act, pro bono publico. And it was said, that

in this case the common law was, that religious and ecclesiastical

persons might have made leases for as many years as they pleased,

the mischief was that when they perceived their houses would be

dissolved, they made long and unreasonable leases: now the stat of 31

H. 8. doth provide the remedy, and principally for such religious and

ecclesiastical houses which should be dissolved after the Act (as the said

college in our case was) that all leases of any land, whereof any estate or

interest for life or years was then in being, should be void; and their

alteration of rent and where, as the result of such a transfer, the terms

on which a dwelling house is held are on the whole less favourable to the

tenant than the previous terms, the rent shall be deemed to be

increased, whether or not the sum periodically payable by way of rent is

increased and any increase of rent in respect of any transfer to a

landlord of any burden or liability previously borne by the tenant where,

as the result of such transfer, the terms on which any dwelling house is

held are on the whole not less favourable to the tenant than the previous

terms, shall be deemed not to be an increase of rent for the purpose of

this Act: Provided that, for the purposes of this section, the rent shall not

be deemed to be increased where the liability for rates is transferred from

the landlord to the tenant, if a corresponding reduction is made in the

rent.

The court had to interpret the employment of the word burden in the

section. Denning L. J., said at page 498,

Was the tenant previously under any burden which now falls on the

landlords? It is said that during the previous tenancy the landlords did

in fact provide the hot water and that therefore the tenant was under no

burden. This is where the rub comes I confess that according to the

ordinary meaning of the word burden the tenant was under no burden

previously to provide hot water. But neither were the landlords. There

was no legal obligation on the landlords to provide hot water and if they

for any reason, good or bad, decided to cut it off, the tenant would have

no legal ground of complaint. When the price of the fuel rose the

landlords would both legally and morally have been justified in saying

that they would not provide hot water unless they were paid a

contribution towards the increase in cost. The tenant was therefore

under the contingent burden, as a matter of practice, of providing

the hot water himself, or paying a contribution towards the

54 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

increased cost, or going without. Under the changed terms all that

burden falls on the landlords. No matter how much the price of fuel

rises, no matter how difficult it is to obtain, the landlords can no longer

cut off the hot water or ask the tenant for a contribution towards the

increase in cost. The change of terms does therefore put on the landlords

a burden which previously fell contingently on the tenant.

He continued,

The question for decision in this case is whether we are at liberty

to extend the ordinary meaning of burden so as to include a

contingent burden of the kind I have described. Now this court has

already held that this sub section is to be liberally construed so as to give

effect to the governing principles embodied in the legislation (Winchester

Court Ltd., vs. Miller [1944] K. B. 734): and I think we should do the

same. Whenever a statute comes up for consideration it must be

remembered that it is not within human powers to foresee the manifold

sets of facts which may arise and even if it were, it is not possible to

provide for them in terms free from all ambiguity. The English language

is not an instrument of mathematical precision. Our literature would be

much the poorer if it were. This is where the draftsmen of Acts of

Parliament have often been unfairly criticized. A judge, believing himself

to be fettered by the supposed rule that he must look to the language

and nothing else, laments that the draftsmen have not provided for this

or that, or have been guilty of some or other ambiguity. It would certainly

save the judges trouble if Acts of Parliament were drafted with divine

prescience and perfect clarity. In the absence of it, when a defect appears

a judge cannot simply fold his hands and blame the draftsman. He must

set to work on the constructive task of finding the intention of Parliament

and he must do this not only from the language of the statute, but also

from a consideration of the social conditions which gave rise to it and of

55 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

the mischief which was passed to remedy and then he must supplement

the written words so as to give force and life to the intention of the

legislature. That was clearly laid down by the resolution of the judges

in Heydons case [Denning says judges, in plural. Coke, however

much his greatness still counts as one] and it is the safest guide today.

Good practical advice on the subject was given about the same time by

Plowden in his second volume Eyston vs. Studd (1574) 2 Plowden 465.

Put into homely metaphor it is this: A judge should ask himself the

question: If the makers of the Act had themselves come across this

ruck in the texture of it, how would they straightened it out? He

must then do as they would have done. A judge must not alter the

material of which it is woven, but he can and should iron out the

creases (page 498, 499)

Lord Simonds, it appears with respect, was not only incorrect in dividing

Denning L. J.s statement into two and purporting to apply the rules in

Haydons case only to the first part, but also wrong in saying that Sir Edward

Coke13 decided that case. It is ironical, that, people who are averse to

filling in the gaps and making sense of the enactment readily accept

ironing out the creases without knowing that it all comes in one.

However, it may be specifically noted, that, this is not to say, that, any filling

in the gaps is required to make the above time limit for the Tax Appeals

Commissiever since. ever since. on mandatory. Such a filling in the gaps is

not required. The statute simply does not give power to the court to extend

time. As it will be referred to in due course, Rowlatt J., in 1921 said as to how

a tax statute must be applied, which has been followed ever since.

In the article ON ASSESSING THE ROLE OF COURTS IN SOCIETY, by Dr.

Shimon Shitreet14, published in Volume 10, 1980 of the Manitoba Law Journal

it is said,

The judiciary, they say, has been timid, unimaginative, not active, not

creative, orthodox, conventional, or conservative in its law-making

functions and that it has over-practised judicial self-restraint. Sometimes

they go further and bestow upon a judge the title of "socially reactionary '

or "the high priest of rigid stare decisis and the limited role for the

judiciary," both titles conferred on Viscount Simonds.

After I have incorporated the above passage from Denning L. J., in Seaford

Court Estates Ld. Vs. Asher [1949] K. B. 481, at page 498,499, which was

done in this case15 but before that in another case16, where the draft was

prepared about four months ago17, it was found that Mahinda

Samayawardhena J., in the Supreme Court 07 Judge Bench case S. C. Appeal

11 2021 delivered on 14th November 2023 has also cited with approval the

same passage from Seaford Court Estates Ltd., giving a purposive

interpretation to Act No. 04 of 199018.

The above was said to show that Viscount Symmonds criticism of Dening L. J.,

in Magor and St. Mellons Rural District Council vs. Newport Corporation, 1951

was unwarranted.

INTRODUCTION THE OBITUARIES OF LORD DENNING in Notes under No. 01

says,

Lord Denning was first appointed to the Court of Appeal in 1948. He

was promoted to the House of Lords by Harold Macmillan on 24th April

1957. In his Romanes lecture of 1959, delivered in the University of

Oxford, Lord Denning seemed to go so far as to claim that the House

of Lords, in its judicial capacity, should appropriate legislative

powers to itself enabling it to change the law when it needed

changing, rather than having to wait on the more leisurely process

of Parliamentary law making. Although the Practice Statement of 1966

was a move in this direction, in 1959 such radicalism was anathema to

the senior Law Lord, Lord Simonds. Although Lord Denning often

dissented from the majority decision in the Lords, his dissent could make

little or no impact. Frequently he was at odds with Lord Simonds in

particular who once memorably expressed his distaste for Lord Dennings

preference for filling in the gaps left by poor or confusing drafting as a

naked usurpation of the legislative function under the thin disguise of

interpretation. According to the Sunday Times obituary, it was the

frustration which resulted from conflict with Lord Simonds that led

Lord Denning to accept the apparent demotion from the House of

Lords consequent on his acceptance of the office of Master of the

Rolls in April 1962. In the Court of Appeal, Lord Dennings judgments,

even the dissenting ones, could have much more impact on the shaping

of the law than was possible in the House of Lords. It is also worth noting

that Lord Dennings appointment to the Court of Appeal on 19th April

1962 was made by Harold Macmillan. Macmillan was an unorthodox

Conservative who was the author of a number of relatively radical

initiatives between 1957 and 1962 ranging from the creation of Life

Peerages, the setting up of the National Economic Development Council,

58 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

the establishment of new Universities and, most radically of all, the

application, in 1961 of the United Kingdom to join the European

Economic Community19.

One single factor to be rectified in the above passage is that it might imply,

that, filling in the gaps disagreement took place when both Lord Simonds and

Lord Denning were in the House of Lords. It was not so, as referred to earlier in

this judgment, Denning L. J.s dissenting judgment in Magor and St. Mellons

Rural District Council vs. Newport Corporation in the Court of Appeal in

which he stated the above, referring to his earlier judgment in Seaford Court

Estates Ltd., vs. Asher [1949] 2 All E. R. 155 is reported in 1950 2 All E. R

1226 whereas Lord Simonds decision in the House of Lords in Magor and St.

Mellons Rural District Council vs. Newport Corporation is reported at 1951

2 All E R 839 at 845.

19 [The rest of the Note is reproduced here in footnote] Macmillans appointment of Lord Denning to the Court of Appeal, as Master of the Rolls, in April 1962 could be seen in this context as an unorthodox, but inherently conservative, attempt to modernise the institution of the law along similar lines to those which Macmillan adopted with regard to other institutions during the period of his premiership. Lord Dennings appointment came between the Orpington by-election, in the seat next door to that of the Prime Minister, which the Conservatives lost to the Liberals, and the so called night of the long knives on 13th July 1962 when Macmillan sacked seven Cabinet ministers, including the Lord Chancellor. It was a time ofdecided instability in the fortunes of the Conservative government. In this context, Macmillans appointment of Lord Denning to conduct the inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the resignation of John Profumo in June 1963 should be considered an astute manouevre; the deployment of a conservative, but unorthodox, judge of Lord Dennings calibre was perhaps the only way in which the gravest crisis of his premiership could have been resolved satisfactorily. In the febrile atmosphere of the summer of 1963, a judge of the stamp of Lord Simonds would not have been able to construct a report which would been credible, let alone have saved the government. Lord Denning did not disappoint; his Report saved Macmillan, perhaps even the Establishment itself. Despite his modest criticism of his conduct as Prime Minster during the affair, Lord Denning retained a substantial amount of respect for Harold Macmillan. He concluded his account of the whole business in Landmarks in the Law by quoting from the letter which Harold Macmillan wrote to him on his retirement on 28th July 1982 in which he praised him for his commonsense, fair play and justice and concluded as Lord Mansfield and Lord Camden, so Lord Denning. Lord Denning then commented that Macmillan was a very great man. Landmarks in the Law [London 1984 p. 365].

The Hon. Justice M.D. Kirby, C.M.G., President of the Court of Appeal,

Supreme Court, Sydney, formerly Chairman, Australian Law Reform

Commission and Judge of the Federal Court of Australia, in his book, Lord

Denning: An Antipodean Appreciation, says,

The original genius of the common law of England lay in its capacity to

adapt its rules to meet different social conditions. The advent of the

representative Parliament has tended to make judges, including appeal

judges, reticent about inventing new principles of law or overturning

decisions that have stood the test of time. "Heresy is not the more

attractive because it is dignified by the name of reform" declared

Viscount Simonds, one of Lord Denning's critics. "It is even possible that

we are not wiser than our ancestors. It is for the legislature, which does

not rest under that disability20, to determine whether there should be a

change in that law and what the change should be.

Justice Micheal Kirby also says,

Needless to say Lord Denning's view of his role frequently drove him

into dissent from other more conventional judges. Even where, in the

Court of Appeal, he carried the day, he was sometimes reversed in the

House of Lords in chilling language. One of his abiding concerns was to

reform the law of contract. He waged a battle over a quarter of a

century against the unfair exclusion of claims by written terms,

sometimes found obscurely on the back of a ticket or form. But to

his 1951 plea for the law to look at the reality of contract relationships,

the Lords answered coldly. "Phrases occur", said Viscount Simon21

"which give us some concern." (British Movietone News Ltd. v. London

and District Cinemas Ltd. [1952] A.C. 166, 181-182.) Lord Simonds

20 It is not that the legislature does not have that disability, but what it legislates subject to that infirmity also goes as law. 21 This is not Viscount Simonds but another Law Lord.

added, "It is no doubt essential to the life of the common law that its

principles should be adapted to meet fresh circumstances and needs.

But I respectfully demur to saying that there has been or need be any

change in the well-known principles of construction of contracts."

(b) No interpretation, let alone purposive interpretation is necessary in

this case:-

But as far as this case and section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act

are concerned, no mischief rule or a purposive interpretation is

required. In fact no interpretation at all is required but the application of

the provision. Sir Roger Manwood, Chief Baron in Heydons case said,

that for the sure and true interpretation of all statutes in general.

Narotam Singhe Bindra says, as it would be seen, in Chapter 07 page 297,

that General and comprehensive words should receive their full and

natural meaning unless they are clearly restrictive in their intendment

(State of Bombay vs. Ali Gulshan AIR 1955 SC 810) Also, as it would be

seen and as Rowlatt J., said in Cape Brandy Syndicate vs. Inland Revenue

Commissioners (1921) 12 TC 358 at page 366, In taxation you have to

look simply at what is clearly said. There is no room for any

intendment;

As it was explained above the reason why Denning L. J., had to apply what His

Lordship said in 1949 in Seaford Court Estates Ltd., vs. Asher was the wrong

decision of the arbitrator that the amalgamation of the Magor and St. Mellons

Rural District Councils amounts to their death. But Denning L. J., said it was

their Marriage. In Seaford Court Estates Limited vs. Asher it was a

question of extending the ordinary meaning of the word burden, which the

context required.

Sometime ago, this judgment referred to the Golden Rule of interpretation in

Chapter 03 of the book of Narotam Singh Bindra. He says at Chapter 07 page

61 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

297, General and comprehensive words should receive their full and natural

meaning unless they are clearly restrictive in their intendment (State of

Bombay vs. Ali Gulshan AIR 1955 SC 810) He discusses in Chapter 11 the

situation when the language is plain. He says,

In Curtis v. Stovin, 22 Q.B.D. 513, 519 Fry, L.J., said: "If the

Legislature have given a plain indication of this intention, it is our plain

duty to endeavour to give effect to it, though, of course, if the word which

they have used will not admit of such an interpretation, their intention

must fail." And then further on his Lordship, after explaining one

possible construction, said : 'The only alternative construction offered to

us would lead to this result, that the plain intention of the Legislature

has entirely failed by reason of a slight inexactitude in the language of

the section. If we were to adopt that construction, we would he

construing the Act in order to defeat its object rather than with a view to

carry its object into effect." (page 441)

He also says,

Courts not to modify language so as to bring it into accord with its own

views of expediency, justice and reasonableness. In Abel v. Lee (1871)

L. R. 06 C. P. 365, 371, Willes, J., said :"I utterly repudiate the notion

that it is competent to a Judge to modify the language of an Act of

Parliament in order to bring it into accordance with his views as to

what is right and reasonable. (page 452)

In Chapter 15 page 521 he quotes Pollock B. as follows,

It must also be remembered that the rule of strict construction of

penal statutes as modified in the modern times is not so rigid or

unbending as it was in times gone by when the cutting down of a

cherry tree in an orchard or the begging or wandering without a pass

by a soldier or sailor was punishable in the United Kingdom with

62 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

death. During the present times the rules mean very little more than

that such statutes are to be fairly construed like all others according to

the legislative intent as expressed by the statute itself or arising out of it

by necessary implication. (Emperor vs. Noor Mohamed AIR 1928 Sind.

1,7 (FB)). What that 'little more' is, has been stated by Pollock, B., in

Parry v. Croydon Commercial Gas Co., ((1863) 15 CB (NS) 568) in the

following passage

"It appears to me that in construing a penal statute of any kind, we

are bound to take care that the party is brought strictly within it,

and to give no effect to it beyond what it is clear that the

Legislature intended. If there be any fair and legitimate doubt, the

subject is not to be burthened. Though no doubt in modern times,

the old distinction between penal and other statutes has, in this

respect, been discountenanced, still I take it to be a clear rule of

construction at the present day that in the imposition of a tax

or a duty; and still more of a penalty if there be any fair and

reasonable doubt, we are so to construe the statute as to give

the party sought to he charged the benefit of the doubt."

Furthermore, Narotom Singh Bindra in the 12th Edition of his book at page 317

says,

The first and primary rule of construction is that the intention of the

legislature must be found in the words used by the legislature itself, if

the words used are capable of one construction only, then it would

not be open to the courts to adopt any other hypothetical

construction on the ground that such hypothetical construction is

more consistent with the alleged object and policy of the Act. The

legislature must be deemed to have intended what it has said. It is no

part of the duty of the court to presume that the legislature meant

63 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

something other than what is said. If the words of the section are

plain and unambiguous, then there is no question of interpretation

or construction. The duty of the court then is to implement those

provisions with no hesitation.

In Chapter 21 page 652 he says,

When a rule of law lays down the conditions under which an order or

judgment shall not be invalid, it by necessary implication must be

deemed to lay down the further rule that the order will be invalid if those

conditions are net fulfilled. (Qaboot vs. Chajju AIR 1948 All 411)

Therefore when jurisdiction to make the determination is limited by time, as in

section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act and when the condition of the

time limit is violated, it is an order or determination made without jurisdiction

by necessary implication.

Despite the present case being under Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 and

Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011, it is pertinent to note, what His

Lordship K. J. Sripavan said in the Special Determination pertaining to the Bill

after amendments became the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017. This is at

page 122 to 124 of The Supreme Court decisions on Parliamentary Bills.

It says,

Court assembled for hearings at 10.00 a.m. on 13.07.2017,

18.07.2017, 20.07.2017, 21.07.2017, 24.07.2017 and 25.07.2017.

Government Gazette on 19.06.2017 and placed on the Order Paper of the

Clause 200

64 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

This Clause refers to the interpretation of the provisions of the Act. This

applies also to Court of law in interpreting the provisions of the Act. This

refers to the manner of interpreting the Act and its provisions and the

material to be considered for the purpose of interpreting the Act.

Interpretation of status is a part of the Judicial power. The Learned

President Counsel for the Petitioner in SC/SD/9/2017 strenuously

argued that Clause 200 encroach upon the judicial power and it violates

Article 3 and 4 of the Constitution. Clause 200 is reproduced below:

Interpretation and avoidance of doubts

200. (1) In interpreting a provision of this Act, a construction that would

promote the purpose or object underling the provision or the law

(whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the law or not),

shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose

or object.

(2) Subject to subsection (5), in interpreting a provision of this Act, if any

material that does not form part of the law is capable of assisting in

ascertaining the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to

that material.

(a) to confirm that, meaning of the provisions is the ordinary meaning

conveyed by the text of the provision, taking into account its context in

this Act and the purpose or object underlying this Act; or

(b) to determine the meaning of the provision when;

(i) the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or

(ii) the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text and taking into

account its context in this Act and the purpose or object

65 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

underlying this Act, leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or

its unreasonable.

(3) Without limiting the generality of subsection (2), material that may be

considered in interpreting a provision of this Act shall include:

(a) all maters not forming part of the Act that are set out in the

document containing the text of the Act as printed by the

Department of Government Printing;

(b) any treaty or other international agreement or international

assistance agreement that is referred to in the Act;

(c ) any explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill containing

the provision, or any other relevant document, that was laid before,

or furnished to the Members of Parliament, by a Minister, before

the time when the provision was enacted;

(d) the speech made to Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of

a motion related to the Bill containing the provision; and

(e) any relevant material in any official record of proceedings of

debates in Parliament or debates of any Parliamentary committee

that considered the related Bill.

It is well settled law that interpreting statutes is power vested in Courts

and considered as part of the judicial power. When interpreting statutes

Courts will follow the well established rules of interpretations. If the

language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for

interpretation and it is a matter of applying the Law. When Court

interpreting statutes it will consider the purpose and object of the Act as

disclosed in the preamble, long title or in the body of the Act. Therefore

66 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

any Act requiring Court to follow a particular method of interpretation or

consider material not forming part of the Act amounts to encroaching

upon powers of the Judiciary and repugnant to the doctrine of separation

of powers recognized in the Article 3 and 4 of the Constitution.

The Learned Presidents Counsel for the Petitioner in SC/SD/ 09/2017

referred to several cases where it was held that interpreting law is a

matter for the Courts. He had cited the case of Queen v. Liyanage 64 NLR

314, Tuckers Ltd. Vs. Ceylon Mercantile Union 73 NLR 31. CWC vs.

Superintended, Beragala Estate 76 NLR 1.

According to Clause 200 (a), (b) and (c ) matters not forming part of the

Act such as documents, explanatory memorandum, speech made by the

Minister by when introducing the Bill and official records could be

considered in interpreting the Act. According to the law as set out in J.B.

Textiles Industries Ltd. Vs. Minister of Finance (1981) 1 SLR 156. De

Silva vs. Jeyaraj Fernandopulle (1996) 1 SLR 22 the Hansard could be

used under limited circumstances. This Clause permits the extraneous

matters and other material not forming part of the Act, to be considered

in interpreting the provisions of the Act. We are of the view this Clause

violates Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution.

Therefore interpretation is within the province of the judiciary. But the Golden

Rule or the application of the statute as it is applies unless the provision is

ambiguous which is not the case in this case.

It is also noted, that, in C. A. Tax 17 of 2021, the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue, the respondent, has filed a written submission dated 25th

January 2023 in which at paragraph 31 reference has been made to the case

Mr. S. P. Muttiah vs. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, C. A. Tax

46/2019 decided on 30th July 2021. It is submitted, that, in that case the

67 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Court based on Caldow vs. Pixcell (1877) 1 CPD 52 566 and Dharendra Krisna

vs. Nihar Ganguly AIR 1943 Calcutta 266 stated that,

In the absence of any express provision the intention of the legislature

is to be ascertained by weighing the consequences of holding a statute to

be directory or mandatory having regard to the importance of the

provision in relation to the general object intended to be secured by the

Act.

The case of Caldow vs. Pixcell (1877) is from the Common Pleas Division in the

Court of Appeal in England. In that case the question was whether the

provision in Ecclesiastical Dilapidations Act of 1871 section 29 the words

within three calendar months after the avoidance of any beneficethe bishop

shall direct the surveyor who shall inspect the buildings of such benefice and

report to the bishop what sum, if any, is required to make good the dilapidation

to which the late incumbent or his estate is liable, is mandatory or directory

as to the time limit.

For the plaintiff it was argued, that, the effect of holding the period of three

months to be imperative is to cast upon the plaintiff the cost of all repairs and

that the primary object of the legislature was that the buildings of a benefice

should be kept in repair, which object will be defeated if section 29 is

construed to be imperative.

It was argued for the defendant, that, when a statute enacts that an act may be

done for the benefit of an individual within a limited time, the act must be done

within that specified time; and that principle applies here, for the main object

of the Ecclesiastical Dilapidations Act 1871 was to provide for the benefit of a

new incumbent.

Denman J., said

68 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

I will now return to section 29 and I may say that the rules for

ascertaining whether the provisions of a statute are directory or

imperative are very well stated in Maxwell on the Interpretation of

Statutes: thus, at pages 330, 331 it is laid down that the scope and

object of a statute are the only guides in determining whether its

provisions are directory or imperative and the judgment of Lord Campbell

in Liverpool Borough Bank vs. Turner 2 De G. F. & J. 502; 30 L. J. (Ch)

379 is cited in support of this proposition; at pages 333, 337 the

distinction between statutes creating public duties and those conferring

private rights is pointed out and it is stated that in general the provisions

of the former are directory but of the latter imperative; and at page 340 it

is laid down that in the absence of an express provision the intention of

the legislature is to be ascertained by weighing the consequences of

holding a statute to be directory or imperative. Upon applying the

principles here set forth I come to the conclusion that section 29 is to be

construed as directory and not as imperative. (page 566)

However, Denman J., said at page 567, that,

Howard vs. Bodington 2 P. D. 203, appears to be most in favour of the

defendant, but it is clearly distinguishable; there the suit was of a

criminal nature and as the defendant did not appear it was necessary to

shew that he had received a copy of the representation against him

within the limited time; it was held that as the limited time had been

exceeded the suit failed.

The above very clearly shows that the principle that was generally followed, as

said in the earlier quotation from the judgment of Denman J., that, the

distinction between statutes creating public duties and those conferring private

rights does not apply if the statute is penal or criminal in nature.

69 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Now what is a tax statute?

As it was quoted above in Pollock, B., in Parry v. Croydon Commercial Gas

Co.,, Pollock B., said,

still I take it to be a clear rule of construction at the present day

that in the imposition of a tax or a duty; and still more of a penalty

if there be any fair and reasonable doubt, we are so to construe the

statute as to give the party sought to be charged the benefit of the

doubt."

Therefore a tax statute has been considered on par with a penal statute and

what was said in Howard vs. Bodington should apply.

Also if the Court in Mr. S. P. Muttiah vs. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue,

2021 reproduced the paragraph 42 of Dharendra Krisna vs. Nihar Ganguly AIR

1943 Calcutta 266 it would have been shown that what the Indian Court said

was,

42. The scope and object of a statute are the only guides in

determining whether its pro-visions are directory or imperative. In the

absence of an express provision, the intention of the Legislature is to be

ascertained by weighing the consequences of holding a statute to be

directory or imperative. No universal rule can be laid down for the

construction of statutes as to whether any en-actment shall be

considered directory only or obligatory, with an implied nullification for

disobedience. It is the duty of the Court to try to get at the real intention

of the Legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the statute

to be construed: Liverpool Borough Bank v. Turner (1860) 2 De. F. & J.

502 at p. 507, per Lord Campbell L.C. In each case the subject-matter is

to be looked to and the importance of the provision in question in

relation to the general object intended to be secured by the Act, is to be

70 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

taken into consideration in order to see whether the matter is compulsive

or merely directory. In the particular case before us, the statute secures

to zemin-dars the extraordinary power of realising what they claim as

balance due before the claim is established in any Court of justice. In

securing this extraordinary power the statute lays down certain

formalities to be observed by the zemindars and expressly makes them

solely responsible for the observance thereof. Where powers, rights or im.

munities are granted with a direction that certain regulations, formalities

or conditions shall be complied with, it seems neither unjust nor

inconvenient to exact a rigorous observance of them as essential to the

acquisition of the right or authority conferred and it is therefore probable

that such was the intention of the Legislature (Maxwell on the

Interpretation of Statutes, Edn. 7, p. 316.).

Therefore what is cited in Mr. S. P. Muttiahs case is not the complete version

and even in that case the Court has held that it seems neither unjust nor

inconvenient to exact a rigorous observance of them as essential to the

acquisition of the right or authority conferred.

The appellant in this case in its Written Submissions dated 21stNovemberr

2023 at paragraph 29 cites the following,

F. A. R. Bennion in Bennion on Statutory Interpretation [London:

LexisNexis, 5th edition, 2008]at page 48 citing Millet L. J., in Petch vs.

Gurney (Inspector of Taxes) [1994] 3 All E R 731 at page 738 states as

follows,

Where a statute requires an act to be done in a particular manner, it

may be possible to regard the requirement that the act to be done as

mandatory, but the requirement that it be done in a particular manner

as merely directory. In such a case the statutory requirement can be

71 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

treated as substantially complied with if the act is done in a manner

which is not less satisfactory having regard to the purpose of the

legislature in imposing the requirement. But that is not the case with a

stipulation as to time. If the only time limit which is prescribed is not

obligatory, there is no time limit at all. Doing an act late is not the

equivalent of doing it in time.

The appellant has cited another passage from Millet L. J., in Petch vs. Gurney

(Inspector of Taxes) [1994] 3 All E R 731 at page 738 in paragraph 33 of the

written submission, which says,

Unless the court is given a power to extend the time, or some other and

final mandatory time limit can be spelled out of the statute, a time limit

cannot be relaxed without being dispensed with altogether and it cannot

be dispensed with altogether unless the substantive requirement itself

can be dispensed with.

Mr. S. P. Muttiah vs. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue, C. A. Tax

46/2019 decided on 30th July 2021 was decided by another division of this

Court. Page 10 paragraph 29 of that judgment says,

It is thus well-established that an enactment in form mandatory might

in substance be directory and that the use of the word shall does not

conclude the matter (Hari Vishnu Kamath v Ahmad Ishaque AIR 1955 SC

233 referring to Julius v. Bishop of Oxford (1880) 5 A.C. 214 HL. Section

10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act does not say what will happen if

the Tax Appeals Commission fails to make the determination within the

time limit specified in Section 10 of the Tax Appeals Commission Act, No.

consequences need not be laid down in order for a provision to be held

mandatory and that in such case, the Court has to consider the natural

consequences that would follow where Parliament had not prescribed a

sanction for breach of a mandatory provision.

It is pertinent to note what was said in Julius vs. Bishop of Oxford (1880) 5 A.

C. 214 H. L. It could be a case on the question of mandatory or directory, but it

was not on a time limit. The case of Julius vs. Bishop of Oxford was referred to

by the House of Lords in the celebrated case of Padfield and others vs. The

Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, [1968] A. C. 997.

In short, the dispute was in respect of the request of South Eastern dairy

farmers that the existing differential was too low. What that is will be

explained in due course. They complained to the Milk Marketing Board and as

they could not persuade that, to the minister. The latter refused to refer the

complaint to the committee. This was the grievance of the dairy farmers when

they came to the Divisional Court of the Queens Bench Division, which held

with them. The minister appealed. In the Court of Appeal the dairy farmers

lost. They had only the support of Lord Denning M. R. in a minority. The dairy

farmers appealed. They won in the House of Lords.

As Lord Denning, M. R. said in the Court of Appeal the dairy farmers of

England and Wales sold their milk to the Milk Marketing Board. The Board

paid a higher price to dairy farmers in the South Eastern region than those in

the Far Western region. The reason was because the South Eastern are much

nearer to London and if they were free, they would sell their milk in London

and would have to bear their own costs of transport. The cost of Sussex

farmers in transporting their milk to London will be much less than that of

Cornish farmers. The Board recognized this and paid a differential to the

South Eastern farmers. They complained that this, which was fixed long ago by

the Minister during the war, was too low.

Lord Reid referring to each partys arguments said,

The respondent contends that his only duty is to consider a

complaint fairly and that he is given an unfettered discretion with regard

to every complaint either to refer it or not to refer it to the committee as

he may think fit. The appellants contend that it is his duty to refer every

genuine and substantial complaint, or alternatively that his discretion is

not unfettered and that in this case he failed to exercise his discretion

according to law because his refusal was caused or influenced by his

having misdirected himself in law or by his having taken into account

extraneous or irrelevant considerations. (page 1029)

The extraneous consideration was that the Minister did not want to displease

the voters in the Far Western region.

In regard to the contention of the Minister, for such a contention was raised,

that he is not bound to give any reasons for refusing to refer a complaint to

the committee Lord Reid having examined the case of Julius vs. Bishop of

Oxford [1880] 5 App. Case, 214, H. L. (E)22 said,

So there is ample authority for going behind the words which

confer the power to the general scope and objects of the Act in order

to find what was intended. (page 1033)

The words material in Julius s case were,

22This case is about a complaint made by Dr. Frederick Guilder Julius against the Rev. Thomas Thellusson Carter, rector of the parish, in respect of unauthorized deviations from the ritual of the Church in the Communion Service, and the use of unauthorized vestments. Dr. Julius preferred a complaint to the Bishop of Oxford and required the Bishop to issue a commission under the Church Discipline Act third and 4th Victoria chapter 86, to inquire into this charge. The Bishop, in the exercise of his discretion, declined to issue this commission. The Court of Queens Bench directed a writ of mandamus to issue commanding the Bishop either to issue the commission which Dr. Julius had applied for or to send the case by letters of request to the Court of Appeal of the province under the Statute. The Court of Appeal reversed this decision1. The House of Lords heard this case on Tuesday 23rd March 1880 and had to decide whether or not the Court of Queens Bench was right in awarding this mandamus1. Lord Chancellor Cairns observed that the words it shall be lawful in section 3 of the Church Discipline Act conferred a faculty or power, and they did not of themselves do more than confer a faculty or power2.

74 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

It shall be lawful for the Bishop of the diocese on the application of

any party complaining thereof to issue a commission for inquiry. (page

1033)

It was held that the words it shall be lawful merely conferred a

power.

But there may be something in the nature of the thing empowered to

be done, something in the conditions under which it is to be done,

something in the title of the person or persons for whose benefit the

power is to be exercised, which may couple the power with a duty and

make it the duty of the person on whom the power is reposed, to exercise

that power when called upon to do so (per Lord Cairns L. C. 222 223)

Hence the nature of the thing, the object, the conditions and the title

of the person or persons whose benefit the power is to be exercised,

creates a duty. On the strength of that decision made in 1880, more than 140

years ago, it could be assumed that those four things, nature, object,

conditions and the title of whose benefit the power is conferred, which

need not be an exhaustive list, confers a duty, upon the holder of the power. It

is because of this and this alone, as this Court sees, the power cannot confer

an unfettered discretion.

ThereforeHari Vishnu Kamath vs. Ahmad Ishaque AIR 1955 Supreme Court

233 referring to Julius vs. Bishop of Oxford shows that even though the

words it shall be lawful confer a power, that power has to be exercised

subject to a duty regulated at least by four things, nature, object,

conditions and the title of whose benefit the power is conferred. Whereas

this is not, as it was already said, regarding a time limit, if that principle

is applied to a time limit it would only mean, that, a power conferred

subject to a time limit must be exercised within that time limit and not

outside it.It is because and only because, (i) the nature as far as this

75 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

case is concerned is income tax, (ii) the object for which the

institutions of the Assessor, Assistant Commissioner, the

Commissioner General and the Tax Appeals Commission are created is

to dispute the self assessment of the tax payer, (iii) the condition

when the matter comes to the Tax Appeals Commission is that it must

be determined within 270 days of the commencement of sittings in

respect of that particular appeal and (iv) the title of whose benefit the

power is conferred is the title (right) of the tax payer to pay income tax

on the self assessment, unless it is validly disputed.

The judgment of Mr. S. P. Muttiah vs. The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue, C. A. Tax 46/2019 also says at page 10 11 paragraph 30,

[30] He referred to the proposition of law that was lucidly explained by

Samarakoon C.J, at pp.184, 190 wherein His Lordship stated as follows:

The statute itself contains no sanction for a failure to

communicate reasons. If it had the matter would be easy of

decision. But the matter does not rest there. One has to make a

further inquiry. If it appears that Parliament intended

disobedience to render the Act invalid, the provision in question is

described as mandatory, imperative or obligatory; if on the

other hand compliance was not intended to govern the validity of

what is done, the provision is said to be directory (Halsburys

Laws of England, Ed 3 Vol. 36-page 434 S. 650). Absolute

provisions must be obeyed absolutely whereas directory provisions

may be fulfilled substantially (Vide- Woodward vs Sarson (1875)

(L.R.10 cp 733 at 746). No universal rule can be laid down for

determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory. It is

the duty of Courts of Justice to try to get at the intention of

the legislature by carefully attending to the whole scope of the

76 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Statute to be construed per Lord Campbell in Liverpool

Borough Bank vs Turner (1860) (2 De CF. & J 502 at 508) Vita

Food Products vs. Unus Shipping Co. (1939 A.C. 377 at 393).

Each Statute must be considered separately and in determining

whether a particular provision of it is mandatory or directory one

must have regard to the general scheme to the other sections of

the Statute. The Queen vs. Justices of the County of London

County Council (1893) 2 Q.B. 476 at 479). It is also stated that

considerations of convenience and justice must be considered.

Pope vs. Clarke (1953) (2 A.E.R. 704 at 705). Then again, it is said

that to discover the intention of the Legislature it is necessary to

consider-(1) The Law as it stood before the Statute was passed. (2)

The mischief if any, under the old law which the Statute sought to

remedy and (3) the remedy itself. (Maxwell on Interpretation of

Statutes, Edition 12 page 160). These are all guidelines for

determining whether Parliament intended that the failure to

observe any provision of a Statute would render an act in question

null and void. They are by no means easy of application and

opinions are bound to differ. Indeed, some cases there may be

where the dividing line between mandatory and directory is very

thin. But the decision has to be made. I will therefore examine the

Statute bearing in mind these guidelines.

It should be noted, that, the case Liverpool Borough Bank vs Turner, 1860

was one of the main authorities relied upon by Parinda Ranasinghe J., in the

case of Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage, referred to above, to say, that, it was

essential for the Judges of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal to take

the oath referred to before the President and that the time limit in Article

126(5) is mandatory.

Justice Parinda Ranasinghe in Visuvalingam vs. Liyanage said,

77 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Where a power or authority is conferred with a direction that certain

regulation or formality shall be complied with, it seems neither unjust

nor incorrect to exact a rigorous observance of it as essential to the

acquisition of the right or authority. Lord Campbell, L.C.,

formulated the test to be adopted in regard to this question, in the

case of The Liverpool Borough Bank vs. Turner, (1860) 30 LJ Ch.

379., as : "......... in each case you must look to the subject matter,

consider the importance of the provision that has been disregarded and

the relation of that provision to the general object intended to be secured

by the Act, and upon a review of the case in that aspect, decide whether

the matter is what is called imperative or only directory." (page 269)

In the 163 year old case of Liverpool Borough Bank vs. Turner, on 21st of

July Vice Chancellor Sir W. Page Wood said, among other things, that,

An analogous difficulty presents itself here in the question whether the

Merchant Shipping Act 1854 having omitted the prohibitory words

otherwise such transfer shall not be valid or effectual for any purpose

whatever, either in law or in equity, is to be considered as mandatory or

merely directory with respect to the mode which it prescribes for carrying

contracts into effect; because, if the Legislature enacts that a

transaction must be carried out in a particular way, the words that

otherwise it shall be invalid at law and in equity are mere

surplusage23. (page 707)

For the reasons mentioned, discussed and analysed above, the Question No. 01

must be answered, Yes.

Question No. 02:

23excessive or nonessential matter

78 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Is the determination made by the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue time barred?

(i) The position of the appellant:

In this regard what is submitted by the appellant is as follows in summary,

- The Appellant argues that the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue is not

authorized to delegate the acknowledgment of an appeal to an Assessor, and

that only statutorily empowered individuals can perform this function.

- The Appellant contends that the acknowledgment of the appeal by an

Assessor does not constitute a legally valid acknowledgment, and therefore the

appeal should be considered as received on the date it was handed over to the

Department of Inland Revenue.

- The determination by the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue was

received by the Appellant after the statutory time bar had expired, leading the

Appellant to argue that the appeal must be deemed to have been allowed by a

certain date.

- The appellant discusses the statutory provisions related to the

acknowledgment of appeals and the powers of the Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue in relation to appeals under the Value Added Tax Act.

- It is emphasized that the power to acknowledge an appeal can only be

delegated to individuals who are lawfully empowered to exercise the powers,

duties, and functions of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue.

(ii) The relevant provisions of the law:

Chapter VI of the Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 governs the procedure in

appeals from the decision of an Assessor to the Commissioner General. Its

salient features are as follows,

79 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

- Registered persons can appeal against assessments, additional

assessments, or penalties to the Commissioner-General within thirty days of

receiving notice. (section 34(1)).

If an agreement is reached during the appeal process, necessary adjustments

to the assessment will be made. (section 34(6)).

If no agreement is reached, the Commissioner-General will schedule a

hearing for the appeal. (section 34(7)).

- Appellants are required to attend the hearing, either in person or through an

authorized representative, and failure to do so may result in dismissal of the

appeal. (section 34(8)).

Any appeal must be agreed to or determined by the Commissioner-

General within two years from the date of receipt, and if not, the appeal is

deemed to have been allowed and the tax charged accordingly.(section

34(8) second proviso).

(iii)The material dates:

The appeal was handed over on 23rd April 2014. The official rubber stamp is

dated 24th April 2014.

The purported notice signed by Mr. R. D. M. S. Muhandiram, Assessor, Large

Taxpayers Appeal Unit extends the date of the receipt of the appeal to 15th May

2014 [incorrectly stated as 2026]

The determination of the Commissioner General is dated 10th May 2016.

It was received by the appellant on 12th May 2016.

In terms of the provisions of section 34(8) second proviso, the determination is

valid only if it is made within two years of the date on which the appeal is

received by the Commissioner General.

80 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Hence, if the date of receipt is 24th April 2014, the determination must be on or

before 23rd April 2016.

If the date of receipt is 15th May 2014, the determination must be made on or

before 14th May 2016.

If the former is correct, the determination is not valid.

If the latter is correct, the determination is valid.

If the determination is not valid, the appeal shall he deemed to have been

allowed and the tax charged accordingly (section 34(8) second proviso).

(iv)The argument of the appellant:

(a) The acknowledgment of the appeal by an Assessor is not valid; the

Commissioner General cannot delegate his authority to an assessor;

hence the effective date of the appeal is 24th April 2014

(b) The determination dated 10th May 2016 is not valid; the appeal must be

allowed; tax to be paid accordingly

(v)The argument of the respondent:

It appears, that, the respondent relies upon the judgment in Lanka Ashok

Leyland PLC vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue C. A. Tax 14/2017

dated 14th December 2018 written by Justice Janak de Silva in which it has

been said, that,

Court is of the view that there is no merit in the submission of the Appellant

that the acknowledgment must be signed by the Respondent. The functions of the

Inland Revenue Department are so multifarious that no Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue could ever personally attend to all of them. In particular, Court

will be slow to impose such requirements unless there is unequivocal language in

the IR Act. It is true that the appeal has to be submitted to the Respondent.

However, that does not mean that the acknowledgement must be by the

Respondent. There is nothing in the IR Act which requires the acknowledgment

81 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

to be made by the Respondent. Similar approach has been taken by our Courts in

applying the Carltona principle in relation to administrative functions to be

performed by Ministers [M.S. Perera v. Forest Department and another [(1982) 1

Sri.L.R. 187] and Kuruppu v. Keerthi Rajapakse, Conservator of Forests [(1982) 1

Sri.L.R. 163].

(vi) The position of the Tax Appeals Commission:

The Tax Appeals Commission in its orders at page 03 and 04 relies upon the

phrases On receipt of a valid petition of appeal the Commissioner-General may

cause further inquiry to be made by an Assessor, other than the Assessor who

made such assessment against which the appeal is preferred (section 34(6))

and the receipt of every appeal shall be acknowledged within thirty days of its

receipt

Thus the Tax Appeal Commission said that the Commissioner at (least at) one

instance is expected to delegate his authority (in respect of a limited matter) to

an Assessor, other than the Assessor who made the assessment and there is no

specific provision as to who shall acknowledge the receipt of the appeal.

(vii) The decision of this Court:

The Appellant says at paragraph 56 of its written submissions as follows,

56. Any given power, duty or function set out in an enactment may be

exercised in one of three possible ways: (i) the person vested with the

power, duty or function may exercise it him/herself; (ii) where the

enactment enables it, a power, duty or function may be delegated

pursuant to an instrument of delegation and exercised in the name of a

delegate; (iii) where the enactment does not include a delegation

provision, and the power, duty or function is of an administrative nature,

the person in whom it is vested may authorize, expressly or impliedly,

another person to exercise it in the name of the person vested with it,

82 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

that is, as an agent. In order to determine the appropriate person to

exercise a power, duty or function it is necessary to consider its nature.

It is also of course necessary to consider whether there is a provision for

delegation in the enactment. As a general rule, where the nature of the

power, duty or function requires the person vested with it to come to an

opinion, belief or state of mind as to if or how it should be exercised, it

should only be exercised by the person vested with the power, duty or

function him/herself, or by a properly appointed delegate through an

instrument of delegation.

The book that Sir William Wade wrote (or what remains from it) Wade and

Forsyths Administrative Law. Twelfth Edition, C. F. Forsyth & I. J. Ghosh,

Oxford, 2023 says at page 256,

The maxim delegatus non potestdelegare is sometimes invoked as if it

embodied somegeneral principle that made it legally impossible for

statutory authority to be delegated (This paragraph was referred to with

approval by the Irish Supreme Court in I. X. vs. The Chief International

Protection Officer & another [2020] IESC 44, paragraphs 37-38) In reality

there is no such principle; the maxim plays no real part in the decision of

casesthough it is sometimes used as a convenient label. In the case of

statutory powers,the important question is whether, on a true

construction of the Act, it is intended that a power conferred upon

A may be exercised on As authority by B. The maxim merely indicates

that this is not normally allowable. (Re S. (a barrister) [1970] 1 Q. B. 160)

For this purpose no distinction need be drawn between delegation

and agency. Whichever term is employed, the question of the true intent

of the Act remains. It is true that the court will more readily approve

the employment of another person to act as a mere agent than the

wholesale delegation of the power itself. But this is due not to any

technical difference between agency and delegation butto the different

83 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

degrees of devolution which either term can cover. The vital question in

most cases is whether the statutory discretion remains in the hands

of the proper authority, or whether some other person purports to

exercise it. Thus, where the Act said thatan inspector of nuisances 'may

procure any sample' of goods for analysis, it was held thatthe inspector

might validly send their assistant to buy a sample of coffee. (Horder vs.

Scott (1880) 5 QBD 552) This mightbe described as mere agency as

opposed to delegation. But that would obscure the trueground, which

was that the inspector had in no way authorised their assistant to

exercisethe discretion legally reposed in themselves. For similar reasons

there can be no objectionto the Commission for Racial Equality using its

officers to collect information in its investigations. (Regina vs.

Commission for Racial Equality ex. P. Cottrell &Rothon [1980] 1 W. L. R.

1580) Another example, which must be close to the boundary, is where a

'selectionpanel' makes a recommendation of a single candidate for:

appointment to the appointing body. Since the appointing body could

reject the recommendation, unlawful delegation to the selection panel

was not found (R (Reckless) vs. Kent Police Authority [2010] EWCA Civ

1277)

The following are characteristic cases where action was held ultra

vires because the effectivedecision was taken by a person or body to

whom the power did not properly belong:

(a) Under wartime legislation local committees were empowered to

direct farmersgrow specified crops on specified fields. A committee

decided to order eight acres of sugar beet to be grown by a farmer,

but left it to their executive officer todecide on which field it should

be grown. The farmer, prosecuted for disobedience,successfully

pleaded that the direction was void, since the executive officer

hadno power to decide as to the field. (Alingham vs. Minister of

84 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Agriculture and Fisheries [1948] 1 All E R 780) The right procedure

would have been for thecommittee to have obtained the officer's

recommendation and to have decided thewhole matter itself.

(b) Registered dock workers were suspended from their employment

after a strike.The power to suspend dockers under the statutory

dock labour scheme was vestedin the local Dock Labour Board.

The suspensions were made by the port manager,to whom the

Board had purported to delegate its disciplinary powers. The

dockersobtained declarations that their suspension was invalid

since the Board had nopower to delegate its functions and should

have made the decision itself.(Bernard vs. National Dock Labour

Board [1953] 2 Q. B. 18)

(c) A local board had power to give permission for the laying of

drains. They empowered their surveyor to approve straightforward

applications, merely reporting thenumber of such cases to the

Board. It was held that the Board itself must decideeach

application, and that delegation to the surveyor was unlawful.

(High vs. Billings (1903) 89 L. T. 550) The result was the same

where a local education committee left it to its chairman to

fix the date of closure of a school (Regina vs. Secretary of State

for Education and Science ex. P. Birmingham CC (1984) 83 LGR 79)

and where the Monopolies Commission allowed its chairman to

decide that a company's takeover proposal had been abandoned

(Regina vs. Monopolies and Mergers Commission ex. P. Argyll Group

PLC [1986] 1 W. L. R. 763)

(d) A local authority, having a statutory duty to provide housing for

homeless persons set up a company which purchased houses,

financed by a loan from a bank which the council guaranteed. This

was held to be impermissible delegation sinceit transferred the

85 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

council's functions to the company, over which the council hadonly

limited control. (Credit Suisse vs. Waltham Forest LBC [1997] Q. B.

362)

From these typical cases it might be supposed that the question was

primarily one of form. Convenience and necessity often demand that a

public authority should workcommittees, executive officers and other

such agencies. The law makes little difficulty over this provided that the

subordinate agencies merely recommend, leaving the legal act of decision

to the body specifically empowered. (Hall vs. Manchester Corporation

(1915) 79 JP 385) It seems that in many situations the real discretion

is being exercised by the body or person that recommends. But the

valid exercise of a discretion always requires a genuine application

of the mind and a conscious choice by the correct authority.

Hence what is apparent from the above discussion, relevant to this case,

is that if (i) the acknowledgment of the receipt of the appeal is something

to be done as a matter of course even an Assessor may do it (ii) but if it

involves discretion, then the correct authority on whom the power is

vested must do it.

Then it is said at page 258,

Delegation should be distinguished from agency. Although there are

plainly similarities between the two concepts, the differences should be

noted. An unauthorised act of anagent may generally be ratified by

the principal but the unauthorised act of the delegate in the

absence of statutory authority, cannot be ratified by the delegator.

Thus the Court of Appeal summarily dismissed the National Dock Labour

Board's claim to have ratified the suspension ofdock workers who had

been invalidly suspended by the port manager, sincethis was a serious

86 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

disciplinary action which only the Board itself was competent to take.

(Bernard vs. National Dock Labour Board [1953] 2 Q. B. 18)

It dismissed no less firmly a minister's claim to have ratified the irregular

requisitioningofa house by a local authority under powers validly

delegated by the minister. (Blackpool Corporation vs. Locker [1948] 1 K. B.

349). Onthe other hand, public authorities are generally allowed to

ratify the acts of their agents retrospectively, both under the

ordinary rules of agency and under liberal interpretationa statute.

(Warwick RDC vs. Miller Mead [1962] Ch 441])Occasionally the court

may even invoke the rules of agency to justify aquestionable delegation.

(Rex vs. Champman ex p. Arlidge [1918] 2 Q. B. 298) Normally a stricter

rule prevails, so that where the Act allows proceedings to be instituted by

an officer authorised by resolution, a later resolution cannot validly ratify

action already taken. (Bowyer Philpott & Payne Ltd., vs. Mather [1919] 1

K. B. 419) It must be emphasised that all these cases turnon the

implications of various statutory provisions: there is no rigid rule.

Another difference between agency and delegation is that in appointing

an agent a principal does not divest themselves of their powers in the

same matter, but whether thepublic authority that delegates its powers

retains the power to act concurrently with itsdelegate is a matter of

controversy discussed later.

A public authority is naturally at liberty to employ agents in the

execution of its powers, as for example by employing solicitors in

litigation, surveyors in land transactions,and contractors in road-

building. The essential thing is that it should take its decisions ofpolicy

itself, and observe any statutory requirements scrupulously.But in

general the Court is likely to be stricter where the issue is one of

substance as opposed to formality.

In one doubtful decision it was held in effect that delegation of its powers

by a local planning authority was justified by a general practice, though

the practice had no legal basis. In another case Denning LJ said:

While an administrative function can often be delegated, a judicial

function rarely can be. No judicial tribunal can delegate its

functionsunless it is enabled to do so expressly or by necessary

implication". (Bernard vs. National Dock Labour Board (above)). The

decisions in fact show that the courts do not normally allow the

delegation even of administrative functions if they involve the

exercise of discretion. There is no general principle that

administrative functions are delegable. The principle is rather that,

where any sort of decision has to be made, it must be made by the

authority designated by Parliament and by no one else. On this

groundthe Director of Public Prosecutions acted unlawfully in delegating

legal work to non legal staff (Regina vs. Director of Public Prosecutions ex

p Association of First Division Civil Servants (1988) 138 NLJ Rep. 158).

The book that Dr. Stanley de Smithwrote in 1950s as a doctoral thesis (or

what remains of it) De Smiths Judicial Review, Seventh Edition by Harry

Woolf, Jeffrey Jowell, Andrew Le Sueur, Catherine Donnelly and Ivan Hare,

South Asian Edition, Sweet & Maxwell, 2015 says at page 326,

In this context, sharp differences of opinion have been expressed on

therelationship between the concepts of delegation and agency. They

have sometimes been treated as being virtually indistinguishable (Huth

vs. Clarke (1890) 25 Q. B. D. 391) but in many cases adistinction has

been drawn between them, particularly where the court is actingon the

assumption that an authority can validlydelegate its powers.

88 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

The correct view seems to be that the distinctions drawn between

delegationand agency are frequently misconceived in so far as they are

based on the erroneous assumption that there is never an implied power

to delegate. Howeversome relationships that are properly included within

the concept of delegation aresubstantially different from those which

typify the relationship of principal andagent. There are three main

characteristics of agency. First, the agent acts onbehalf of his principal,

he does so in his nameand the acts done by the agent are broadly

applicable to delegation in administrative lawand it would generalbe held

to be unlawful for an authority to invest a delegate with

powersexercisable in his own name. But where legislative powers are

delegated byParliament, or validly sub-delegated by Parliament's

delegate, the delegate or sub-delegate exercises his powers in his own

name. And in the schemes of administrative delegation drawn up in local

government law, the relationships between the local authorities

concerned have often been far removed fromthose connoted by the

relationship of principal and agent. (inter delegation between local

authorities was considerably diminished by the Local Government Act

1972; but see now Localism Act 2011 Pt. 1)

Secondly, the agent can be - given detailed directions by his

principal anddoes not usually have a wide area of discretion. On the

other hand one to whomstatutory discretionary powers are

delegated often has a substantial measure of freedom from control

in exercising them. But the degree of freedom from control with which

he is vested may be a decisive factor in determining the validity ofthe

delegation made to him.

The more significant are the effective powers of control retained by

thedelegating authority, the more readily will the courts uphold the

validity ofthe delegation; and they may choose to uphold its validity by

denying that there has been vested by statute continues to address its

own mind to the exercise of the powers (As in Devlin vs. Barnett [1958] N.

Z. L. R. 828).

The book says at page 332,

Comparative perspectives on delegation:

In Australia it has been held that delegation to an office holder does not

requirerenewal each time there is a change in the holder of that office: it

has also heldthat revocation of a delegation does not affect the validity of

the delegates acts until the moment of revocation. (Fyfe vs. Bordoni

[1998] SACS 6860). In addition, the delegation by an office holder does

not require renewal each time there is a change in the holder of that

office(Johnson vs. Veterans Review Board (2002) 71 A. L. D. 16).

Canadian courts have in the past taken a restrictive view of the

competence oflocal authorities to confer a free discretion on their

members or officials todispense with prohibitions embodied in byelaws.

Thus, Montreal could not makea byelaw providing that nobody was to

run a business in the city without anofficial permit; this was analysed as

an invalid sub-delegation. (Vic Restaurant Inc vs. Montreal [1959] S. C. R.

58). And in anothercase, (Brant Dairy Co. Ltd., vs. Milk Commission of

Ontario (1976) 58 D. L. R. (3rd) 484 at 502 504) a marketing board (itself

a sub-delegate) was empowered to make regulations on certain matters;

the regulations that it made were held invalid onthe ground that they

contained no standards, but reserved to the board the power to exercise

its discretion case by case. The board was said not to have exercised the

legislative function delegated to it but to havesub-delegated to itself

anadministrative function(This reasoning reflects to a limited degree the

argument advanced in K.C. Davis, Discretionary Justice: a Preliminary

Inquiry (1969), pp.57-59, that bodies and officials in whom discretion is

vested should be under an obligation to confine and structure it by the

promulgation of decisional criteria so as to strike the best balance in the

context between rules and discretion. This is a variation of the non

delegation doctrine at one time used by the Supreme Court of the United

States to render invalid statutes that delegated legislative power without

setting sufficiently precise limits upon its exercise, e.g. Field vs. Clark 143

U.S. 649 (1892). See Jaffe, "An Essay on Delegation of Legislative Power

(1947) 47 Colum. L. Rev. 359, 561. It later reappeared in other contexts,

e.g. Shuttlesworth vBrimmingham 394 U. S. 147 (1969) (byelaw requiring

that permit be obtained before holding public demonstration, invalid

because of the broad discretion entrusted to an official); Furman v Georgia

408 U. S. 238 (1972); Profitt v Florida 428 U.S. 242(1976), where the

constitutionality of capital punishment was attacked in part because of the

broad discretion delegated" to the judge and jury in imposing it. Cf.

Francis vs. Chief of Police [1973] A.C. 761 at 773, where the PC held that a

statutory requirement that the permission of the Chief of Police be obtained

before noisy instruments" could lawfully be used at public meetings did

not delegate so much discretion as to infringe the freedom of speech and

assembly provisions of a constitution of St Christopher, Nevis and

Anguilla).

The New Zealand decisions are conflicting; sometimes such provisions

havebeen construed as valid conditional prohibitions, and sometimes as

subdelegations the validity of which may be dependent on the

prescription of standards governing the exercise of the dispensing power.

(Mackay vs. Adams [1926] N. Z. L. R. 518). Issues such as thesehave

seldom arisen in the English courts. (Francis vs. Chief of Police [1993] A.

C. 761). If an absolute prohibition would bevalid, then prima facie a

conditional prohibition should be upheld; (Williams vs. Western super

Mare UDC (1907) 98 L. T. 537 at 540) but it may be relevant in some

91 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

cases to consider the context, the persons to whom the dispensing of

regulatory power are delegated and the scope of the authority delegated"

to them.

In India the principle of non-delegation has also been upheld, (Sahni

Silk Mills (P) Ltd., vs. ESI Corp [1994] 5 S. C. C. 346 at 352) however

due to the enormous rise in the nature of activities to be handled by

statutory authorities, the maxim delegates non potestdelegare is

not being applied specially when there is a question of exercise of

administrative discretionary power. (Sahni Silk Mills (P) Ltd., vs.

ESI Corp [1994] 5 S. C. C. 346 at 350).

In South Africa the principle of non-delegation is more strictly

applied,although "it is not every delegation of delegated powers that is

[prohibited], but only such delegations as are not, either expressly or by

necessary implication,athorised by the delegated powers". (Attorney

General, OFS vs. Cyril Anderson Investments (Pty) Ltd., 1965 (4) SA 628, A

at 639D).

The important case of AAA Investments (Pty) Ltd v Micro Finance

Regulatory Council (2007 (1) S. a. 343, CCillustrates degrees ofwillingness

to find implied authority for sub-delegation. In her dissentingjudgment

O'Regan J. readily accepted that even in the absence of expressauthority

it would be practically necessary for the Minister to sub-delegate

hisregulatory power to the Council. (paragraph 135). In another

dissenting opinion Langa C.J. wasmore cautious, suggesting that "courts

should be slow to infer the delegation ofpower to bodies that cannot be

held directly accountable through ordinarypolitical processes.

(paragraph 88. The majority held that owing to the limited scope of the

challenge, the sub delegation had to be accepted as lawful (paragraphs 47

48).

Stanley de Smith, at page 334 onwards refer to the Carltona Principle. As

Justice Janak de Silva had also referred to this in the above case of Lanka

Ashok Leyland PLC vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue C. A. Tax

14/2017 dated 14th December 2018, this will be also examined.

The Carltona principle

Special considerations arise where a statutory power vested in a minister

or adepartment of state is exercised by a departmental official. The

official is notusually spoken of as a delegate, but rather as the alter ego

of the minister or thedepartment: (Lewisham Borough vs. Roberts [1949]

2 K. B. 608, 629) power is devolved rather than delegated. (Regina vs.

Secretary of State ex. P. Oladehinde [1991] 1 A. C. 254 at 283 284, C.

A.)(A different analysismust, of course, be adopted where powers are

explicitly conferred upon ordelegated to an official by a law-making

instrument. (As where power to decide certain classes of planning

appeals have been vested in inspectors by legislation. And see Somerville

vs. Scottish Ministers [2007] UKHL 44; [2007] 1 W. L. R. 2734). Under

the "Carltona"principle the courts have recognised that "the duties

imposed on ministers and thepowers given to ministers are normally

exercised under the authority of theministers by responsible officials of

the department. Public business could not becarried on if that were not

the case" (Carltona Ltd., vs. Commissioners of Works [1943] 2 All E R

560 at 563). In general, therefore, a minister is notobliged to bring his

own mind to bear upon a matter entrusted to him by statutebut may act

through a duly authorised officer (cf. Customs and Excise

Commissioners vs. Cure & Deeley Ltd., [1962] 1 Q. B. 340 manner of

authorization prescribed by statute held, not complied with) of his

department. (West Riding [1941] 2 Al E R 827). The officer's authority

need not be conferred upon him by the minister personally,(Lewisham

[1949] 2 K. B. 608) it may be conveyed generally and informally by the

93 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

officer's hierarchicalsuperiors in accordance with departmental practice.

(Lewisham [1949] 2 K. B. 608). Whether it is necessary forthe authorised

officer explicitly to profess to act on behalf of the minister is notcertain,

but it is suggested that this will not usually be required. (cf. Woollett

[1955] 1 Q. B. 103 at 120 121, 132,134 Denning and Morris L. JJ.).

In R. (on the application of National Association of Health Stores)

vDepartment of Health, the Court of Appeal considered whether the

knowledgewithin the department should in law be imputed to the

minister (who made thedecision to prohibit the use of a herbal remedy in

foodstuffs in ignorance of thespecial expertise of a particular adviser).

Sedley L.J. held that to impute theknowledge would be "antithetical to

good government", ([2005] EWCA Civ 154 at [26]) and result in asituation

where the person with knowledge decides nothing and the personwithout

knowledge decides everything". Modern departmental government, hefelt,

required ministers to be properly briefed about the decisions they must

take.He was not willing to accept that the collective knowledge of the civil

servants inhis department or their collective expertise would necessarily

be treated as theminister's own knowledge and expertise. (Thus

distinguishing Lord Diplock's assertion to the contrary in Bushell v

Secretary of State for the1811AC. 75 at 95. It was held that the

considerations of which the minister had no knowledge were not

"relevant". See also M.Freedland, "The Rule Against Delegation and

theDoctrine in an Agency Context" [1996] P.L. 19 (who argues that in

conferring apower on a minister, the parliamentary draftsmen are in

effect employing a formula that the discretion is conferred upon the

government department). Sedley L.J. considered that such aproposition

would have the effect that ministers need to know nothing before

reaching a decision so long as those advising them know the facts" at

[37] -which he called the law according to Sir Humphrey Appleby (an

illusion to the permanent secretary in the television comedy Yes

Minister); I. Steele, Note on R. (National Association of Health Stores)

vs. Department of Health [2005] J. R. 232)

It may be that there are, however, some matters of such importance that

theminister is legally required to address himself to them personally, (In

re Golden Chemical Products Ltd., [1976] Ch. 300 the judge denied that

such a category existed. But see Ramawad vs. Minister of Manpower and

Immigration [1978] 2 S. C. R. 375 and R (on the application of Tamil

Information Centre) vs. Secretary of State for the Home Department

[2002] EWHC 2155; (2002) 99 L. S. G. 32 where it was held that

ministerial authorization was an impermissible delegation as the statute

required the minister personally to exercise his judgment) despite the

fact that many dicta that appear to support the existence of such an

obligation are at best equivocal (In re Golden Chemical Products Ltd.,

[1976] Ch. 300 at 309 310, Brightman J. concluded that the dicta in

Liversidge vs. (Sir John) Anderson [1942] A. C. 206 should be understood

as referring to political expediency and to the ministers personal

responsibility to Parliament, rather than to his legal obligation) It is,

however, possible that orders drastically affecting theliberty of the

persona - e.g. deportation orders, (Rex vs. Chiswick Police Station

Superintendent ex. P. Sacksteder [1918] 1 K. B. 578 at 585 586, 591

592 (dicta)) detention orders made underwartime security regulations

(Liversidge vs. (Sir John) Anderson [1942] A. C. 206 at 223 224,

265,281) and perhaps discretionary orders for the renditionof fugitive

offenders (Regina vs. Brixton Prison Governor e. P. Enahoro [1963] 2 Q.

B. 455 at 466) require the personal attention of the minister. (Had he

believed that such a category existed,the judge in Re Golden Chemicals

might well have included in it the power to present a petition for the

compulsory winding up of a company (Companies Act 1967 s.10). See D.

Lanham, "Delegation and the Alter Ego Principle" (1984) 100LQR 587,

592-594 (who argues that where life or personal liberty are at stake, the

alter ego principle may not apply).

On the other hand, the minister was not required personally to

approvebreath-testing equipment, despite its importance to the liberty of

motoristssuspected of driving after consuming alcohol, (Regina vs.

Skinner [1968] 2 Q. B. 701) and a decision on the question ofa life

sentence prisoner's tariff period may be taken on behalf of the

HomeSecretary by a Minister of State at the Home Office. (Doody vs.

Secretary of State for the Home Department [1994] 1 A. C. 531).

Objection to theproduction of documentary evidence in legal proceedings

on the ground that itsproduction would be injurious to the public

interest must be taken by the ministeror the permanent head of the

department, certifying that personal considerationhas been given to the

documents in question. (Duncan vs. Cammell, Laird & Co [1942] A. C.

624, 638). Statutory instruments are signedby senior officials acting

under a general grant of authority from the minister (E. C. Page vs.,

Governing by Numbers: Delegated Legislation and Everyday Policy

Making (2001)).

Similarly, it is uncertain whether the courts will examine the

suitability of theofficial who performs the work. The Carltona case

emphasised thatParliament,not the courts, was the forum for scrutiny of

the minister's decision, (Regina vs. Secretary of State for the Home

Department ex. P. Oladehinde [1991] 1 A. C. 254 at 281 282. C. A.) but

morerecently it has been accepted that the courts may also examine the

devolvementof authority, by way of judicial review. (Regina vs. Secretary

of State for the Home Department ex. P. Oladehinde [1991] 1 A. C. 254,

QBD at 206: C. A. at 282. Although it did not arise for decision in the

case. in DPPvs. Haw (2007] EWHC 1931 (Admin); [2008] 1 W.L.R. 379

96 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Lord Phillips C.J. suggested (at [29]) that there was scope for

furtherrefinement of the Carltona principle, and devolution of a

minister's powers should be subject to a requirement that the seniority of

the official exercising: a power should be of an appropriate levelhaving

regard to the nature of the power in question).

At the very least, it would seem that theofficial must satisfy the test

of Wednesbury unreasonableness: he must not be sojunior that no

reasonable minister would allow him to exercise the power.(Regina

vs. Secretary of State for the Home Department ex. P. Oladehinde [1991]

1 A. C. 254 at 304). There may be some tasks which by their nature

ought not to allow of delegationor devolution, such as some disciplinary

powers. (Regina vs. North Thames Regional Health Authority and Chelsea

and Westminster NHS Trust Ex. P. L (1996) 7 Med L. R. 385) And

different tasks conferredon a decision-maker may be delegable to

different levels within the organisation(For example the application task

and the consultation task in Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police

[2002] EWHC 1087; [2003] Crim. L. R. 37).

The Carltona principle may be expressly excluded by legislation, (See

e.g., Immigration Act 1971) butwhether it may in addition be excluded by

statutory implication remainsuncertain. Two situations should be

distinguished. Where a power of delegation isexpressly conferred by

Parliament on a minister, it may compel the inference thatParliament

intended to restrict devolution of power to the statutory method,

thusimpliedly excluding the Carltona principle. (Customs and Excise

Commissioners vs. Cure and Deeley Ltd., [1962] 1 Q. B. 340).

Commonwealth authority, however, suggests that such an implication

will not readily be drawn. (O Reilly vs. Commissioner of State Bank of

Victoria (1982) 44 A. L. R. 27). It has alsobeen suggested that the

principle may be impliedly excluded where it appearsinconsistent with

97 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

the intention of Parliament as evinced by a statutory frameworkof powers

and responsibilities, (Ramawad vs. Minister of Manpower and

Immigration (1978) 81 D. L. R. (3rd) 687). However, where the

Immigration Act 1971apparently clearly divided responsibilities between

immigration officers and theSecretary of State, the Court of Appeal and

House of Lords held that the Carltonaprinciple enabled powers of the

Secretary of State to be exercised by immigrationofficers. In the Court of

Appeal it was said that the Carltona principle was notmerely an

implication which would be read into a statute in the absence of anyclear

contrary indication, but was a common law constitutional principle,

whichcould not be excluded by implication unless "a challenge could be

mounted onthe possibly broader basis that the decision to devolve

authority was Wednesburyunreasonable" (Regina vs. Secretary of State

for the Home Department Ex. P. Oladehinde C. A. 282). The House of

Lords allowed the devolution of power on the narrower ground that the

implication to exclude could not be drawn; thedevolution did not conflict

with or embarrass [the officers] in the discharge oftheir specific statutory

duties under the Act (Regina vs. Secretary of State for the Home

Department e. P. Oladehinde). Although their statutory analysismay be

questioned, (Weight was placed on several explicit limitations of the

minister's powers toexcluding further implicit limitations; yet it was

surely consistent of Parliament to intend somepowers to be exercised by

the minister personally, some to be exercised by the minister or his

civilservants in the department, and others to be exercised by

immigration officers as the statutory schemeappeared to require) the

approach of the House of Lords accorded greaterweight than the Court of

Appeal to Parliament's intent.

Does the Carltona principle apply to public authorities or officers

besidesministers (See e.g. Lanham 604 et seq.). Powers of the Queen or

Governor in Council may be exercised by aminister or official in his

department, although any formal decision necessarilywill be made by the

Queen in Council. (FAI Insurance Ltd., vs. Winneke (1982) 151 C. L. R.

342). Powers conferred on seniordepartmental officers may be

devolved to more junior officials in the department. (Commissioners

of Customs and Excise vs. Cure and Deeley [1962] 1 Q. B. 340). In Nelms

v Roe ([1970] 1 W. L. R. 4 at 8 Lord Parker C. J.) the Divisional Court

upheld a decision of apolice inspector acting on behalf of the

Metropolitan Police Commissioner, onwhom the power had been

conferred. However, Lord Parker did not think that theinspector

could be considered the alter ego of the Commissioner and preferred

tobase the case on implied delegated authority.

However, the Court of Appeal has held that the Carltona principle

istransferable to non-ministerial bodies and that applications for

antisocialbehaviour orders (ASBOS) could be made by junior police

officers despite thefact that the power was conferred upon a local council

or chief officer of police.Sedley L.J. stressed that Carltona was based not

only on convenience (the alterego aspect) but also upon the fact that the

minister continued to be responsible forthe decision taken by the official

in his department. Provided that (a) the power isdelegable, and (b) is not

required to be performed by a particularly qualifiedindividual (such as a

medical officer of health or a statutory inspector), it may beexercised at

different levels. The delegation or devolution of powers was, in

thosecircumstances, for the Chief Constable to decide, and the court

could notsecond-guess him unless his choice was irrational or beyond

his powers. (Regina (on the application of Chief Constable of the west

Midlands) vs. Birmingham Magistrates Court [2002] EWHC 1087

(Admin))

Section 34(6) says,

99 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

(6) On receipt of a valid petition of appeal the

Commissioner-General may cause further inquiry to be made by an

Assessor and if in the course of such inquiry an agreement is reached as

to the matters specified in the petition of appeal the necessary

adjustment of the assessment shall be made.

Hence the Act has specifically provided for the delegation of that power, which

is, to cause further inquiry to be made by an Assessor. But the entirety of

this section or any other provision does not provide for the Commissioner

General to acknowledge the appeal having delegated that authority to an

Assessor. Furthermore, the specific provision above, which makes it for the

Commissioner General to cause inquiries to be made by an Assessor shows by

application of the maxim Generaliaspecialibus non derogant and even

otherwise, that, a specific power of delegation in regard to the matter under

section 34(6) was expressed, because, it is not possible generally to delegate

the powers of the Commissioner General.

Section 34(1) says,

(1) Any registered person may if he is dissatisfied with any

assessment or additional assessment made in respect of him by an

Assessor, or a penalty imposed under this Act, appeal against such

assessment, additional assessment or penalty, as the case may be, to

the Commissioner-General

Hence the appeal has to be made to the Commissioner General. Then it must

be acknowledged by him unless there is a provision which specifically says he

can delegate it. It could have been accepted by an Assistant Commissioner too.

There is no requirement that the very person who for the time being holding

the position of the Commissioner General must acknowledge it. It is because

an Assistant Commissioner is his agent. But an Assessor is not. This is what

this Court gathers from the discussion pertaining to delegation referred to

100 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

above. Hence 16th May 2014 has no validity. The acknowledgment is dated 24th

April 2014. Hence the determination made by the Commissioner General is

time barred.

Question No. 03:

Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in coming to the conclusion

that the appellant was a manufacturer within the contemplation of the

Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 (as amended)?

The appellant under Question of Law No. 03 says at paragraph 81 of written

submissions that,

"A bank robber who asks the bank clerk to handover money is making an

order backed by a threat. The bank clerk is obliged to follow the order of

the bank robber even though the order is not legal. When the tax

collector demands a tax payment the tax payer is under an obligation to

make the payment because the order is one which has the force of Law.

It is this distinction between being "obliged" to do something and being

under an "obligation" to do so that was alluded by H. L. A. Hart in his

work The Concept of Law [Oxford: OUP 3rd Edition 2012]. A person may

be obliged to do an unlawful act (like the bank clerk handing over money

to the bank robber) but a person is under an obligation to perform only

lawful acts (such as a taxpayer handing over a payment to the tax

collector)".

Hence it is submitted, that, the right to demand a tax must have the authority

of law. Otherwise, it is submitted, that the distinction between the bank robber

and the tax collector is obliterated.

On the premise it is argued that as the fiscal statute, in this case the Value

Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 imposes a tax liability on a manufacturer of

goods, the above principle applies.

101 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

The crux of the matter is, whether Reckitt Benckiser (Lanka) Limited is the

manufacturer of Mortien and Harpic. It says no. The products are

manufactured, according to the appellant as shown in the following diagram,

RBLL (Appellant) (Reckitt Benckiser (Lanka) Limited

The product Mortien and Harpic

MML(MOS Lanka Manufacturing) LCL (Lalan CM (Pvt)

Ltd.,)

Reckitt Benckiser (Lanka) Limited contends, that, it provides only the brand

name. Mortien is manufactured by MOS Lanka. Harpic is produced by Lalan.

Both of them sell their products to Reckitt Benckiser (Lanka) Limited.

The following is what was contended before the Tax Appeals Commission, as

per its order,

The Respondent (Commissioner General) contended that MOS Lanka and Lalan

manufacture respective products for and on behalf of the appellant. The

appellant is the manufacturer. Hence it must pay VAT.

Appellant contended that MOS Lanka and Lalan are not mere service

providers. They are contract manufacturers for the relevant products.

102 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

This is in line with the global practice in the manufacture of branded goods by

third parties ordinarily alluded as contract manufacture. It involves the

production of goods by one company under the brand or label of another

company.

Contract manufacture in not defined in the VAT Act.

The appellant further contended that it has purchased goods

manufactured by MOS Lanka and Lalan and it has paid VAT on the

supplies made by those contract manufacturers. That it has not claimed

input credit in respect of purchases and not charged VAT from sales as it is

engaged in buying goods from contract manufacturers. It is only engaged in the

wholesale and retail sale of Mortien and Harpic and does not manufacture

and sell these goods.

The appellant has said that it retains the right to reject the manufactured

product sent to it by MOS Lanka.

It said that if Harpic products manufactured by Lalan is not in the required

quality the products are to be destroyed by Lalan at Lalans cost.

Why is it so important, not to be the manufacturer?

Because of the operation of sections 02 and 03 in the Value Added Tax

Act No. 14 of 2002.

They are as follows,

CHAPTER I

IMPOSITION OF VALUE ADDED TAX

Imposition of

Tax

2.

(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a tax, to

103 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

be known as the Value Added Tax(hereinafter

referred to as "the tax") shall be charged

(a)at the time of supply, on every taxable

supply of goods or services, made in a

taxable period, by a registered person in the

course of the carrying on or carrying out, of a

taxableactivity by such person in Sri Lanka

,

(b)on the importation of goods into Sri Lanka,

by any person.

Tax not be charged

on wholesale or

retail supply of

goods.

3.Notwithstanding the provisions of section 2, the tax

shall not be charged on the wholesale or retail supply of

goods, other than on the wholesale or retail supply of

goodsby-

(a)a manufacturer of such goods ; or

(b)an importer of such goods ; or

(c) a supplier who is unable to satisfy the

Commissioner-General, as to the source

from which the goods supplied by him,

were acquired:

So section 02 charges VAT on supply of goods. Section 03 grants an exception

to wholesale or retail supply of goods. Then there is a further exception, to the

104 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

exception. If that wholesale or retail supply is by a manufacturer of the goods,

he must pay VAT.

The appellant submits about the alleged contradictory positions in the

following two judgments in this regard,

(i) Unilever Sri Lanka Limited vs. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue C. A. Tax 04/2013 dated 04th November 2022 written by Dr.

Ruwan Fernando J., with the concurrence of Sampath K. B. Wijeratne

J.

(ii) Unilever Sri Lanka Limited vs. Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue C. A. Tax 23/2029 written by Sampath K. B. Wijeratne J., with

the concurrence of Dr. Ruwan Fernando J.

However, as it appears, both learned Justices have decided, that, R M

Chemical Ceylon (Pvt) Limited (RMCC) or Polypak Secco Limited (PSL) are not

the manufacturer but the Unilever and hence it is liable to pay VAT.

Justice Fernando said, that, RMCC and PSL are not selling the goods as the

exclusive owner, not transferring exclusive ownership to the appellant and the

question of passing ownership does not arise.

Justice Wijeratne said, that, supply of goods means the passing of exclusive

ownership of goods to another, there is no passing of exclusive ownership of

goods here and RMCC and PSL are engaged in a supply of services.

Justice Fernando also said, that, a transfer of possession of goods without the

transfer of exclusive ownership is only a supply of services.

Justice Fernando concluded, that, the appellant must be regarded as the

manufacturer of the products within the meaning of section 3(1)(a) of the Value

Added Tax Act.

Justice Wijeratne concluded, that, the appellant cannot claim the exemption

under section 03 of the Value Added Tax Act.

105 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Hence there is no stark contradiction as claimed by the appellant.

According to the appellant the Supreme Court has granted leave to appeal in

five connected matters having as one of the questions, whether the Court of

Appeal misdirected itself in construing the meaning of the word manufacture

in section 83.

Now under section 02 VAT must be charged,

(i) On taxable supply of goods

(ii) At the time of supply

(iii) In the course of carrying in or carrying out of a taxable activity

Under section 03,

(iv) VAT is not charged,

(v) On the wholesale or retail supply of goods

(vi) By a manufacturer of such goods

Section 83 defines taxable supply of goods.

taxable supply" means any supply of goods or services made or deemed

to be made in Sri Lanka which is chargeable with tax under this Act and

includes a supply charged at the rate of zero percent other than an

exempt supply.

It defines supply of goods

supply of goods" means the passing of exclusive ownership of goods to

another as the owner of such goods or under the authority of any written

law and includes the sale of goods by public auction, the transfer of

goods under a hire purchase agreement, the sale of goods in satisfaction

of a debt and transfer of goods from a taxable activity to a non-taxable

activity.

It defines supply of services

106 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

supply of services" means any supply which is not a supply of goods

which includes any loss incurred in taxable activity for which an

indemnity is due.

Now how does section 83 define the word manufacture?

"manufacture" means the making of an article, the assembling or

joining of an article by whatever process, adapting for sale any article

packaging bottling, putting into boxes, cutting, cleaning polishing

wrapping labeling or in any other way preparing an article for sale other

than in a wholesale or retail activity;

As it was said above both the justices Fernando and Wijeratne said that supply

of goods is passing of exclusive ownership in the goods and if not it is a supply

of services.

What is said in the above paragraph must be understood in a structured

manner so to speak due to several definitions given in section 83.

The primary definition of the term supply of goods under that section is

asking of exclusive ownership.

Supply of services mean all supplies other than supply of goods.

The Tax Appeal Commission in this case decided this question having

considered section 02 of the Sale of Goods Ordinance No. 11 of 1896.

The Tax Appeal Commission says,

the sale of goods take place where the seller transfers the exclusive

ownership, i.e., the title and possessions for goods to the buyer. (at page

09 of the order of the Tax Appeals Commission)

The Sale of Goods Ordinance nowhere uses the term exclusive.

Its section 02 is as follows,

107 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

2(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfers

or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a money

consideration, called the prize. There may be a contract of sale between

one part owner and another.

If this is simplified it reads,

2(1) A contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller

transfers...the property in goods to the buyer for a money consideration,

called the prize. There may be a contract of sale between one part

owner and another.

Supply of goods as defined in the Act requires passing of exclusive ownership.

The definition of the supply of goods in the Act includes the sale of goods by

public auction. But the Sale of Goods Ordinance never refers in section 2(1) to

exclusive ownership.

The appellant here argues that MOS Lanka and Lalan manufacture the goods.

Why should, if it is so, the transfer of goods by MOS Lanka and or Lalan to the

appellant should be a supply of goods under the Act where exclusive ownership

is passed?

We saw, that, under section 02 of the Value Added Tax Act VAT must be

charged

(I) on taxable supply of goods

(II) at the time of supply and

(III) in the course of carrying in or carrying out of a taxable activity

But this is, with respect, not a question of imposing VAT on the supply of

goods. This is the question who is the manufacturer. So when the alleged

manufacturer transfers the good to the alleged brand name owner who

according to him has given a contract for the contract manufacturer, must the

108 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

transfer of goods by the contract manufacturer to the one who appointed him

on that contract a supply of goods which requires the passing of the exclusive

ownership of the goods? I do not think so. Unless someone reads into the Value

Added Tax Act.

Hence the position of the appellant that it has purchased the goods

manufactured by MOS Lanka and Lalan could be accepted.

Furthermore, as the Tax Appeals Commission said, why should MOS Lanka

and Lalan be the owners of the product? Cannot a person manufacture a

product of which he is not the owner? The farmers in ancient Egypt produced

(something similar to manufacturing) barley and wheat from the days of

Pharos. Were they the owners?

Justice Wijeratne says at page 30 that RMCC has set up a plant exclusively for

the making of Vim scourer bars for an on behalf of the appellant. Will that

make, if the assembling and joining etc., is done by RMCC, not the

manufacturer? No. Because the definition of manufacture never say that

it should not be on behalf of another, it must be free from the control of

another in regard to quality and quantity or if some of the ingredients are

supplied by the person who grants the contract manufacture agreement

then it is not the product of the person who took the contract agreeing to

manufacture.

This is a conflation of the concept of manufacturing with that of

ownership which conflation is not required warranted or allowed by any

law including sections 02 and 03 of the Value Added Tax Act: Sale of

Goods Ordinance or the definition of the term manufacture in section

83 of the former Act.

Justice Wijeratne says that in the Indian case of Commissioner of Sales Tax

U. O. Vs. Dr. Sukh Deo 1969 AIR 499 the Supreme Court of India defined a

109 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

manufacturer as a person by whom or under whose direction and control the

articles or materials are made.

The Tax Appeals Commission in this case at page 10 says that when making a

deep analysis of the case, it becomes clear that the role played by these two

companies has to be of a service provider. Just how deep?

When the law in this country provides how deep the decision maker should go,

can he go beyond that? The consideration of the Indian definition of a

manufacturer is unwarranted and not permitted when the very Act under

consideration defines what manufacture is. At times courts unnecessarily fetter

their jurisdiction on what they think as legal barriers which are self imposed

non existing barriers. They tend to take decisions that defeat rules of

interpretation natural justice and the rule of law thinking that in doing so they

execute what the state (which is understood as synonymous to law) wants. The

state is a creature of law. The law is a creature of the constitution. The

constitution is a creature of the rights of the People (P for People in capital in

its Preamble). Section 83 says manufacture means (not includes), its

meaning for the purpose of this Act is restricted, it means the making of

an article, the assembling or joining of an article by whatever process

(this includes mechanical or chemical or any other process) adapting for

sale any article packaging bottling putting into boxes cutting cleaning

polishing wrapping labeling or in any other way preparing an article for

sale other than in a wholesale or retail activity. It does not say that the

manufacturer must be the exclusive owner, that he must do it in his own free

will not subject to anyone elses quality control or the ingredients also must

belong to the manufacturer.

When a contract manufacturer is obligated to uphold quality requirements, it

does not necessarily limit them to being solely a service provider.

Contract Manufacturer (CM):

110 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

A contract manufacturer is an entity that produces goods or components on

behalf of another company (the contract giver).

CMs are often engaged in manufacturing processes, assembly, and production.

They play a crucial role in the supply chain by producing items based on

specifications provided by the contract giver.

Quality Requirements:

Quality requirements encompass standards, specifications, and regulations

that ensure the products meet predefined quality levels.

These requirements cover aspects such as safety, efficacy, consistency, and

compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).

Quality Agreements:

Quality agreements are formal documents that outline the responsibilities and

expectations between the contract giver and the contract acceptor (CM).

These agreements define roles, quality parameters, and regulatory compliance.

They ensure that both parties understand their obligations regarding quality

control, testing, documentation, and other critical aspects.

Quality agreements are essential for maintaining product quality and safety.

CM as a Service Provider:

While CMs provide manufacturing services, their role extends beyond mere

service provision.

By adhering to quality requirements, CMs contribute significantly to the overall

quality of the final product.

They collaborate closely with the contract giver to ensure that the

manufactured items meet the desired standards.

111 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

CMs are accountable for maintaining GMPs (Good Manufacturing Practices),

handling raw materials, conducting quality checks, and ensuring consistent

production.

Conclusion:

Being under a duty to maintain quality requirements does not diminish

the CMs significance.

Instead, it underscores their critical role in delivering high-quality

products.

CMs are more than service providers; they are essential partners in the

production process, safeguarding quality and patient safety.

In summary, while quality requirements are a duty for contract manufacturers,

they remain integral contributors to the entire product lifecycle, transcending

the label of a mere service provider.

It is said, that, contract manufacturing is a type of outsourcing that involves

hiring a manufacturer to create products or components for another

company24. The hiring company specifies the design, performance, and

quantity of the products, which may be under their own label or brand25.

Contract manufacturing allows the hiring company to save on startup and

production costs26.

It is said,

Contract manufacturing is not a recent phenomenon. Its origins can be

traced back to the early days of industrialization. However, the advent of

globalization and technology has accelerated its evolution, transforming

it into a vital component of the modern manufacturing landscape.

The advent of globalization in the 20th century allowed companies to

outsource production to regions with lower labor costs, thereby

expanding contract manufacturing beyond national boundaries. This

trend was further enhanced by 21st-century technological advancements

like automation and digitalization. Together, these shifts have

transformed contract manufacturing from a cost-saving strategy to a

value-adding partnership, now integral to navigating the complexities of

the modern manufacturing landscape27.

In regard to the advantageous of contract manufacturing, it is said,

Contract manufacturing provides numerous advantages that

significantly contribute to a company's growth and profitability. By

leveraging external resources, businesses can create more efficient, high-

quality production processes, providing them with an edge in the

competitive marketplace. The key advantages can be categorized as

follows:

Cost-Efficiency: Contract manufacturing allows businesses to outsource

production, significantly reducing overhead costs including machinery,

maintenance, and labor. Lower costs can translate into higher profit

margins.

Resource Allocation: Savings from manufacturing can be redirected to

vital areas like research and development or marketing, allowing for a

more effective utilization of resources.

Expertise and Technology: Contract manufacturers bring a wealth of

experience and advanced technologies. By leveraging these assets,

businesses can enhance product quality and speed up time-to-market.

Competitive Advantage: Higher product quality and faster production

times, achieved through contract manufacturing, give companies a

distinct competitive edge over their rivals28.

The headquarters of Mercedez Benz is in Stuttgart, Germany. It became a

global name in the 19th century. Karl Benz was the first person to own a

drivers license. His patent for the Benz Patent Motorwagen in 1886 is widely

considered to be the first automobile. Later that same year, Gottlieb Daimler,

along with engineer Wilhelm Maybach, also converted a stagecoach by adding a

petrol engine, effectively eliminating the need for horse-powered transportation.

These pioneering efforts by Carl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler laid the foundation

for the iconic Mercedes-Benz brand we know today. Although the main

factory is still at Stuttgart, Germany Benz is today manufactured in 22

countries including United States (Tuscaloosa) Austria (Eugendorf) Canada

(Burnaby) Brazil (So Bernardo do Campo) Mexico (Several facilities) China

(Beijing) Romania (Sebes and Cugir) and France (Hambach).

Even if it is assumed, that, theSale of Goods Ordinance says that the sale takes

place when the seller transfers the exclusive ownership, under an agreement

of contract manufacture the manufacturing party does not have to sell what it

manufactures to the person on whose behalf it was done. The Brand name

owner has outsourced the function of manufacturing to a manufacturer. This

manufacturers work comes thoroughly and squarely within the definition of

manufacture under section 83 of the Act. Why, then, is it necessary to impose

the mantel of manufacturing on the Brand name owner?

Is not doing so a naked usurpation of the legislative function under the thin

guise of interpretation29? As this Court sees, it is. Like in that Indian case

referred to above, the purported definition a person by whom or under whose 28What Is Contract Manufacturing? Role and Benefits | Komaspec 29 Refer to page 46 of this judgment as well as page 48 of this judgment, on both pages to the highlighted parts, Lord Simmonds in that case was not justified in saying so. But as a matter of law, principle and policy, a court cannot and must not legislate by way of interpreting or applying a statute.

direction and control the articles or materials are made cannot be understood

to influence the courts decision without reading into the statute, without

usurping the legislative function.

The respondent says in its written submissions that contract manufacture is

done to avoid tax. A fiscal statute is a penal statute. It was already said in

regard to the Question No. 01 above. It will be referred to in due course in

regard to a decision of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka too. But the operation

of a taxing statute is different to the operation of the penal code. If a person

can without doing what is illegal under the law circumvent a taxing provision

he is entitled to it. That is the meaning of article 148 of the constitution and

what the learned Chief Justice K. Sripavan quoted from another case in the

Special Determination before the Supreme Court dated 21.07.2016 in the

matter none other than an amendment to the Value Added Tax, which is

reproduced.

Article 148 of the constitution says,

Parliament shall have full control over public finance. No tax, rate or

any other levy shall be imposed by any local authority or any other

public authority, except by or under the authority of a law passed by

Parliament or of any existing law30.

Chief Justice Sripavan said,

Learned Presidents Counsel reminded us the observations made in

S.C.F.R. Application 169/2016 - (S. C. Minutes of 22.06.2016) in the

following manner:

It is a cardinal principal of interpretation that words in Article 148

must be understood in their natural, ordinary and proper sense.

The golden rule is that the words must prima facie given their 30 No taxation without Representation was the slogan on which Boston Tea Party was staged and the basis on which America waged war against the British Crown to gain its independence as the United States of America.

ordinary meaning. It is another rule of construction that when the

words of the Constitution are clear, plain and unambiguous then

the Court is bound to give effect to that meaning irrespective of the

consequences. The Court cant brush aside the words used in

Article 148 as being inappropriate or surplus. Thus, the Court

reiterates that the Constitutional provisions must be

interpreted having regard to the Constitutional objectives and

goals and not in the light of how the Government may be

acting at a given point of time. The Court has to uphold the

principle of [the] rule of law which is vital for the real

establishment of democracy and the maintenance of the rule of

law. Therefore far from interfering with good governance of the

State, the Court helps the good governance by reminding the

Executive and its officers that they should act within the four

corners of the Constitution and not contravene any of its

provisions.

Hence it is decided, that, MOS Lanka and Lalan are the manufacturers of

Mortien and Harpic respectively and not the appellant. Question No. 03 is

answered in favour of the appellant as Yes.

Question of Law Nos. 04, 05 and 06:

On the basis of the answer given by this Court to the substantive Question of

Question No. 03, these questions must be answered in favour of the appellant.

Hence in regard to the points of the order of the Tax Appeals Commission being

against the weight of the evidence; the amount of VAT and penalty imposed

being arbitrary and unreasonable and that it erred in law, this Court answers

all those three questions as Yes.

Hence the Questions of Law are answered as follows:-

(01) Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission time barred?

116 | C . A . T a x 1 4 2 0 2 0 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n & J u s t i c e K h e m a S w a r n a d h i p a t h i 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Yes

(02) Is the determination made by the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue time barred?

Yes

(03) Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law in coming to the conclusion

that the appellant was a manufacturer within the contemplation of the

Value Added Tax Act No. 14 of 2002 (as amended)?

Yes

(04) Is the determination of the Tax Appeals Commission against the weight

of evidence?

Yes

(05) Is the amount of Value Added Tax and penalty payable, as confirmed by

the Tax Appeals Commission excessive arbitrary and unreasonable?

Yes

(06) In view of the facts and circumstances of the case did the Tax Appeals

Commission err in law when it arrived at the conclusion that it did?

Yes

Therefore the appeal in the form of a Case Stated is allowed.
