Introduction

WNS Global Services (Private) Limited, the Appellant, is a limited liability

company incorporated and domiciled in Sri Lanka. The company's primary

business activities include operating domestic and international back-office

customer operations, call centres, data processing services, and customer support

centres.

The Respondent is the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter

referred to as the CGIR)

Factual background

The Appellant filed its income tax return with the Inland Revenue Department

(hereinafter referred to as the IRD) for the year of assessment 2011/2012.

However, the Assessor rejected the return through a letter dated 23rd October

2014, issued under Section 163(3) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006

(hereinafter referred to as the IR Act). In the same letter, the Assessor outlined

3

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

the reasons for not accepting the return. Following this, the Assessor proceeded

to issue a Notice of Assessment1.

Dissatisfied with the assessment, the Appellant filed an appeal with the CGIR

under Section 165 of the IR Act. On 27th December 2016, the CGIR upheld the

Assessors assessment2, and the Appellant was notified of the reasons for his

determination in a letter dated 2nd March 20173. The Appellant, still aggrieved,

then appealed to the Tax Appeal Commission (hereinafter referred to as the

TAC) under Section 7 of the Tax Appeal Commission Act No. 23 of 2011, as

amended. On 27th January 2023, the TAC confirmed the CGIRs determination

and dismissed the appeal. The Appellant, dissatisfied with this outcome,

requested the TAC to state a case to this Court based on the following five

questions of law.

1. Is the Appellant fully entitled to the tax exemption conferred

under and in terms of Section 13(ddd) of the Inland Revenue Act

No. 10 of 2006 (as amended), in respect of its business income?

2. Is the Appellants interest income, which is less than 5 million, is

liable to income tax at the rate of 12% under and in terms of Part

B of the Second Schedule of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of

2006 (as amended)?

3. Is the assessment excessive and without lawful justification?

4. Is the determination of the Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue time barred?

5. In view of the facts and circumstances relating to the case has the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue erred in law in coming

to the conclusion that he did?

Both parties submitted their initial written submissions, and the case advanced

to the argument stage. Upon the conclusion of the arguments, both parties sought

permission to file additional written submissions, which the court allowed.

However, only the Appellant filed a final written submission, and it was also

submitted after the due date. The Respondent, on the other hand, did not file a

final written submission.

Analysis

I will now move on to address the questions of law presented to this Court.

(i) Is the Appellant fully entitled to the tax exemption conferred under

and in terms of Section 13(ddd) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of

2006 (as amended), in respect of its business income?

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant argued that the Appellant

company is entitled to an income tax exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR

Act for the year of assessment 2011/2012. However, whether the Appellant met

the requirements of this section was not an issue before the CGIR, the TAC, or

this Court. Therefore, this Court need not deliberate on the matter. The issue is

whether the tax liability of Appellants business income is governed by Section

13(ddd) of the IR Act or by the agreement between the Appellant Company and

the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (hereinafter referred to as the BOI).

The agreement between the Appellant company and the BOI4 stipulates that the

provisions of the IR Act No. 38 of 2000 regarding the imposition, payment, and

recovery of income tax on the company's profits and income shall not apply for

a period of five years5. This period begins from the year of assessment as

determined by the Board. The year of assessment is defined as either the year in

which the company starts to generate profits or any year of assessment not later

4 At pages 54 to 63 of the appeal brief. 5 IR Act No.38 of 2000 was replaced by IR Act No. 10 of 2006 with effect from 1st April 2006. Nevertheless, income tax exemption granted under the BOI agreement is validated under Section 218(3) of the latter Act.

5

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

than two years from the commencement of commercial operations, whichever

occurs first, as specified in a certificate issued by the Board.

After the expiration of the aforementioned tax exemption period, the company's

profits and income will be taxed at a rate of ten percent (10%) for the two years

immediately following the end of the exemption period. After this two-year

period, the tax rate will increase to fifteen percent (15%). The CGIR concluded

that since the agreement between the company and the BOI remains in effect,

the Appellant company cannot deviate from the agreement's conditions without

altering or terminating the agreement.

The central issue before this Court is whether the agreement between the

Appellant company and the BOI can override the provisions of the IR Act,

specifically Section 13(ddd). The Appellant is a limited liability company

incorporated and domiciled in Sri Lanka. The BOI entered into an agreement

with the Appellant company following an application made by the foreign

company M/s WNS (Mauritius) Ltd., located at 10, Free Felix De Valois Street,

Port Louis, Mauritius, on behalf of the Appellant, in accordance with BOI law6.

The Appellant began its commercial operations in the 2004/2005 assessment

year but did not generate profits during the first two years. Consequently, the

Appellant benefited from a tax exemption under the BOI agreement for five

years, starting from the 2006/2007 assessment year under and in terms of IR Act

No. 10 of 20067. After this period, the Appellant diverged from the agreement

and claimed entitlement to a tax exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act.

As previously stated in this judgment, the BOI agreement specifies that after the

five-year tax exemption period, the company must pay income tax at ten percent

(10%) for the following two years and fifteen percent (15%) thereafter.

Therefore, as stated above, the fundamental question is whether the conditions

of the agreement between the Appellant company and the BOI take precedence

over the provisions of the IR Act.

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

Section 17 (1) of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law, No. 4 of 1978, as

amended provides as follows;

17 (1) the Commission shall have the power to enter into agreements with any

enterprise in or outside the Area of Authority and to grant exemptions from any

law referred to in Schedule B hereto, or to modify or vary the application of

any such laws, to such enterprises in accordance with such regulations as may

be made by the Minister.

(2) Every such agreement shall be reduced to writing and shall upon

registration with the Commission, constitute a valid and binding contract

between the Commission and the enterprise. (emphasis added)

The Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 20068, which is pertinent to this case, is listed

together with Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979, the Inland Revenue Act No.

38 of 2000, in the schedule of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law No. 4

of 1978, as amended.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant argued that Clause 12 of the

agreement between the Appellant and the BOI mentions benefits, exemptions,

and privileges but does not address the imposition of a tax burden. It was

contended that the 10% tax rate would only apply in circumstances where the

Appellant has taxable income from the specified activity where the standard tax

rate is higher. The core of the argument is that, similar to the five-year exemption

granted under the same agreement, the BOI intended to offer a 10%

concessionary tax rate for the two-year period following the end of the five-year

tax holiday, and a 15% concessionary rate thereafter.

In contrast, the CGIR, the Respondent, argued that the BOI's intention was to

provide a complete tax exemption for the initial five years to allow the company

to generate profits. After this period, the CGIR contended, that the BOI aimed to

offer a concessionary tax rate of 10% and 15% compared to higher tax rates

8 Listed as item 5 by the amendment Act No. 36 of 2009.

7

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

otherwise the Appellant company has to pay9 and/or to provide a grace period

for the company to establish its business before it begins paying income tax.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant company argued that when

the agreement with the BOI was made, the income tax rate for companies,

according to the Inland Revenue Act No. 38 of 2000 (as amended), was 35%10.

Therefore, the 10% and 15% rates specified in the agreement were

concessionary. He contended that the agreement should be interpreted to align

with the parties' intentions. While he acknowledged that the intent was for the

Appellant company to benefit from a concessionary tax rate after the tax holiday,

he asserted that once the tax holiday concludes, the tax exemption provided by

the applicable law should apply. In this context, the concessionary rates granted

by the agreement would be irrelevant, as the Appellant would be entitled to a tax

exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act by virtue of the law.

Accordingly, it was argued that the 10% and 15% rate is no longer a

concessionary rate. Consequently, he submitted that the Clauses in the BOI

agreement regarding exemption from income tax and the concessionary rates are

now redundant. However, he acknowledged that even the IR Act No. 10 of 2006

has a provision similar to the aforementioned provision in the Inland Revenue

Act No. 38 of 2000, as amended, where the applicable tax rate is 35% prior to

the 1st April 2011 and 28% after the 1st April 201111.

The learned Presidents Counsel acknowledged in his written submissions that

when an agreement is entered into with the BOI of Sri Lanka, the provisions of

that agreement supersede the relevant provisions of the IR Act12. However, he

(At paragraph 36 of the final Written submissions filed by the Appellant). 12 At paragraph 26 of the preliminary Written submissions filed by the Appellant. (At paragraph 30 of the final Written Submission filed by the Appellant).

8

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

argued that, despite this, the provisions of the IR Act should take precedence

over the agreement. The Counsel strongly contended that tax impositions can

only be established by the relevant fiscal statutes and that the BOI of Sri Lanka

cannot impose fiscal liabilities but can only grant privileges and concessions.

I will now move on to address the argument outlined above.

Clause (1) of the agreement states that;

(1) The enterprise shall be entitled to and shall set up/conduct, and operate the

business in accordance with the undertakings, representations,

commitments, and proposals made by the enterprise and set out in the said

application and set out in this agreement () (emphasis added).

Consequently, the Appellant company is required to conduct its business in

accordance with the terms of its agreement with the BOI.

Under Section 17(1) of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka Law No. 4 of 1978,

as amended, the BOI is empowered not only to grant exemptions but also to

modify or vary the application of any such laws specified in Schedule 'B'. It is

admitted that the IR Act No. 10 of 2006 is included in Schedule B of the Act.

Furthermore, as the BOI Act is a special law, it is generally understood to take

precedence over the general law, the IR Act No. 10 of 2006. Accordingly, it is

clear that the BOI has the authority to modify or vary the application of the IR

Act No. 10 of 2006 in regard to matters within their domain.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant also referred to Section 48C

of the IR Act No. 10 of 2006, as amended, to support his argument. This section

stipulates that the tax imposed after the end of a tax exemption period under the

BOI agreement should not be more burdensome than the tax under the IR Act.

However, the term taxation under such agreement in Section 48C undermines

the Appellant's argument that tax liability cannot be imposed by the BOI

agreement, as the IR Act itself allows for such a scenario.

9

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

Moreover, although the learned Presidents Counsel cited Section 48C in his

written submission13, it is important to note that this provision was introduced

by Amendment Act No. 18 of 2013, effective from 1st April 2013. The year of

assessment in issue is 2011/2012, covering 1st April 2011 to 31st March 2012.

Consequently, Section 48C is not applicable to the issue at hand and I am

displeased and completely puzzled why it was cited.

Additionally, the introduction of this provision through an amendment indicates

that a more burdensome tax than that under the IR Act could have been imposed

by an agreement, prior to the amendment. Nonetheless, these arguments hold

only if the Appellant is eligible for the concessionary tax rate under Section 13

(ddd) of the IR Act.

The Appellant also brought forth the following arguments.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant submitted in his written

submissions the following extract form the judgement of His Lordship Sripavan

J., (as His Lordship then was) in Vallibel Lanka (Pvt) Limited v. Director -

General of Customs14;

It is the established rule in the interpretation of statutes levying taxes and duties,

not to extend the provisions of the statute by implication, beyond the clear import

of the language used or to enlarge their operation in order to embrace matters

not specifically pointed out. In case of doubt, the provisions are construed most

strongly against the state and in favour of the citizen thus, the intention to impose

duties and/or taxes on imported goods must be shown by clear and ambiguous

words. (.) One must have regard to the strict letter of the law and cannot

import provisions in the Customs Ordinance so as to supply any assumed

deficiency.

13 At paragraph 42 of the final Written Submission filed by the Appellant. 14 [2008]SC Appeal 26/2008.

10

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant also cited several judgments15

and a reference from Maxwell on the 'Interpretation of Statutes16,' arguing that

in matters of taxation, it has to be looked simply at what is clearly said and there

is no room for any intendment; there is no equity about a tax. If the person sought

to be taxed comes within the letter of the law, he must be taxed, however great

the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be. On the other hand, if the

crown seeking to recover the tax, cannot bring the subject within the letter of the

law, the subject is free.

It was also argued that if a provision is reasonably capable of two alternative

interpretations, Courts will prefer the interpretation that is more favourable to

the taxpayer17.

However, in this case, there are no such alternative meanings to consider in

interpreting Section 13(ddd) and the provisions of the agreement. Similarly,

there is no ambiguity in either the statutory provision or the agreement. The task

before this Court is to determine whether the Appellant is entitled to the tax

exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act or whether the Appellant is liable

to pay tax according to the relevant provisions of the agreement.

Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the Appellant is not eligible for the

tax exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act and is required to pay taxes

as stipulated in the agreement with the BOI.

(ii) Is the Appellants interest income, which is less than 5 million, is liable

to income tax at the rate of 12% under and in terms of Part B of the Second

Schedule of the Inland Revenue Act, No. 10 of 2006 (as amended)?

Part B (d) of the Second Schedule of the IR Act No. 10 of 2006, as amended

reads as follows;

PART B

(a) ()

(b) ()

(c) ()

(d) For any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2011, but prior

to April 1, 2014-

Any company engaged in the manufacture of any article or in the provision of

any service-

(A) (i) of which the taxable income does not exceed Rs. 5,000,000/-;

(ii) which is not a company referred to in PART - A; and

(B) which is not the holding company, a subsidiary company, or an associate

company of a group of companies,

on the taxable income

For the purpose of item (B) of paragraph (b), paragraph (c) and paragraph

(d), the expressions holding company, subsidiary company, and group

of companies shall have the same respective meanings which they have in

the Companies Act, No.7 of 2007 and includes a holding company or a

subsidiary of any company incorporated or registered outside Sri Lanka.

The Appellant claimed the 12% concessionary tax rate under Part B(d) of the

Second Schedule of the IR Act, arguing that the business profits were exempt

from income tax under Section 13(ddd) of the Act. Based on this claim, the

Appellant submitted its income tax return18, declaring a taxable income of Rs.

1,929,476/-, which is less than Rs. 5,000,000/-. However, the Assessor

determined that the Appellants business profits were not exempt under Section

13(ddd) of the Act. Consequently, the Notice of Assessment issued to the

Appellant indicated a taxable income of Rs. 220,300,661/-, significantly

exceeding Rs. 5,000,000/-.

18 At pp. 70 to 77 of the appeal brief.

12

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

This Court has already determined that the Appellant is not entitled to the tax

exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act and answered Question of Law

No. 1 in the negative. Consequently, the Appellants taxable income exceeds

5,000,000/-, making the Appellant ineligible for the concessionary tax rate under

Part B (d) of the Second Schedule of the Act.

Therefore, I answer Question of Law No. 2 in the negative, in favour of the

Respondent.

(iii) Is the assessment excessive and without lawful justification?

The Appellants claim that the assessment is excessive and without lawful

justification is based on the premise that the Appellants business profits are

exempt from income tax under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act. Accordingly, the

Appellant argues that the interest income should also be subject to the

concessionary rate specified in Part B (d) of the Second Schedule of the IR Act.

However, this Court has already determined that both of the Appellants claims

are flawed, rendering the assessment lawful and justified.

Consequently, I answer the third question of law in the negative, in favour

of the Respondent.

(iv) Is the determination of the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

time barred?

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant argues that the CGIR's

determination is time-barred, and as a result, the appeal should be considered as

having been allowed.

It is undisputed that the Appellant's petition of appeal against the assessment was

served on the IRD on 22nd December 201419. The CGIR's determination, dated

27th December 2016, was communicated to the Appellant by letter on 28th

December 201620.

Appeals to the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

Section 165 (14) of the IR Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended provides as follows;

165 (1)-(13) ().

(14) Every petition of appeal preferred under this section, shall be

agreed to or determined by the Commissioner- General, within a

period of two years from the date on which such petition of appeal is

received by the Commissioner- General, unless the agreement or

determination or such appeal depends on

(a) the decision of a competent court on any matter relating to

or connected with or arising from such appeal and referred to it

by the Commissioner- General or the appellant; or

(b) the furnishing of any document or the taking of any action

(i) by the appellant, upon being required to do so by an

Assessor or Assistant Commissioner or the

Commissioner-General by notice given in writing to such

appellant (such notice being given not later than six

months prior to the expiry of two years from the date on

which the petition of appeal is received by the

Commissioner-General); or

(ii) by any other person, other than the Commissioner-

General or an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner.

Where such appeal is not agreed to or determined within such period,

the appeal shall be deemed to have been allowed and tax charged

accordingly.

(15) () (emphasis added)

14

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

However, the IRD acknowledged the Appellants appeal in a communication

dated 5th January 201521, stating that the official date of acknowledgment of the

appeal would be 5th January 2015.

Section 165 (6) of the IR Act states the following;

165 (1)-(5) ()

(6) The receipt of every appeal shall be acknowledged within thirty

days of its receipt and where so acknowledged, the date of the

letter of acknowledgement shall for the purpose of this section, be

deemed to be the date of receipt of such appeal. Where however

the receipt of any appeal is not so acknowledged, such appeal shall

be deemed to have been received by the Commissioner General on

the day of which it is delivered to the Commissioner-General.

(7)-(15) () (emphasis added)

Based on the aforementioned communication, the appeal was acknowledged

within thirty days of its receipt.

However, the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant argued that the

Assistant Commissioner who acknowledged the appeal was not legally

authorized to do so for an appeal made to the CGIR, rendering the

acknowledgment invalid. Consequently, it was argued that the appeal should be

considered as having been received by the CGIR on the actual day it was

delivered to the CGIR.

Under Section 165(14) of the IR Act, the CGIR is required to determine every

appeal within two years from the date of its receipt.

Acknowledging the appeal

I will now address the question of whether the acknowledgment of the appeal by

Assistant Commissioner K.K.J.C. Deshapriya is legally flawed.

21 At page 90 of the appeal brief.

15

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

The learned Presidents Counsel referred to the definition of the term

'Commissioner General' provided in Section 217 of the IR Act, which is the

interpretation section of the Act, which reads as follows:

217. Commissioner- General means the Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue appointed or deemed to be

appointed under this Act, and: -

a) In relation to any provision of this Act, includes the

Senior Deputy Commissioner-General, a Deputy

Commissioner General, Senior Commissioner, a

Senior Commissioner and Commissioner who is

specially authorized by the Commissioner- General

either generally or for some specific purpose, to act on

behalf of the Commissioner-General;

In relation to Chapter XXIII, includes an adjudicator appointed by the

Minister and authorized by the Commissioner-General under that

Chapter;

It was argued in light of the interpretation that under the Act, the Commissioner

General could only grant special authorization to a Senior Deputy Commissioner

General, a Deputy Commissioner General, a Senior Commissioner, or a Deputy

Commissioner.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant also cited relevant parts of

Section 208 which reads thus;

208 (1) ().

(2) A Senior Deputy Commissioner-General or a Deputy

Commissioner-General or a Senior Commissioner or Commissioner

or a Commissioner exercising or performing or discharging any

power, duty or function conferred or imposed on or assigned to the

Commissioner-General by any provision of this Act, shall be deemed

for all purposes to be authorized to exercise, perform or discharge

that power, duty or function until the contrary is proved.

16

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

(3) ().

(4) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other provisions

of this Act, a Senior Assessor or Assistant Commissioner of Inland

Revenue or an Assessor or Assistant Commissioner of Inland Revenue

shall not-

a) Act under Section 163; or

b) Reach any agreement or make any adjustment to any

assessment made under subsection (7) of Section 165.

Except with the written approval of the Commissioner-General or any

Commissioner.

(5) (). [emphasis added]

Citing Section 208 (2), the Appellant's learned Presidents Counsel argued that

the implied delegation under the Act is also limited to a Senior Deputy

Commissioner-General or a Deputy Commissioner-General or a Senior

Commissioner or a Commissioner. Accordingly, it was argued that

acknowledging an appeal is a statutory duty that can only be delegated to

someone who is legally authorized to act on behalf of the CGIR. Essentially, the

argument is that the deeming provision in Section 208(2) does not allow an

Assistant Commissioner or Assessor to act on behalf of the Commissioner

General in acknowledging an appeal submitted to the Commissioner General.

Section 208(4) explicitly states that an Assistant Commissioner or Assessor may

not act under Section 163(3) or reach any agreement or make adjustments to any

assessment made under Section 165(7) without the written approval of the

Commissioner-General or any Commissioner. Since acknowledging an appeal

falls under Section 165(6) of the IR Act, it is clear that this act does not require

the written approval of the Commissioner-General or any Commissioner.

Section 165(7) allows the CGIR to direct an Assessor or Assistant

Commissioner, who was not involved in the original assessment, to conduct

further inquiries, upon receiving a valid petition of appeal. This indicates that the

Legislature's intent in enacting the provisions of Sections 208 and 217 was not

17

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

to restrict the CGIRs authority to have an Assistant Commissioner or an

Assessor perform any acts required under the Inland Revenue Act.

Another argument advanced by the learned Presidents Counsel is that the name

printed on the acknowledgment form should be judicially noticed as the person

authorized to acknowledge an appeal.

The learned Presidents Counsel cited section 213 and 194(5) of the IR Act No

10 of 2006, (as amended), which provides as follows;

213. The Commissioner-General may from time to time specify the forms to be

used for all or any of the purposes of this Act, and any form so specified may

from time to time be amended or varied by the Commissioner-General or some

other form may be substituted by the Commissioner-General, in place of any

form so specified. Any form so specified by the Commissioner-General may be

published in the Gazette.

194 (1)-(4) ()

(5) Every name printed or signed on any notice or signed on any certificate given

or issued for the purposes of this Act, which purports to be the name of the person

authorized to give or issue the same, shall be judicially noticed.

In contrast to the argument presented by the learned Presidents Counsel for the

Appellant, who contended that the Commissioner General is not statutorily

authorized to permit an Assistant Commissioner or Assessor22 to acknowledge

an appeal, it was argued that the name printed on the designated acknowledgment

form represents the individual authorized to acknowledge the appeal.

Interestingly, the designation printed on the form is Assessor.

This contention contradicts the Appellant's own submission that an Assessor is

not statutorily empowered to acknowledge an appeal23.

Relevance of the Carltona doctrine

Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of works is the case where the famous doctrine

known as Carltona Principle on delegation of authority was set out. Lord

Green, M. R. delivering the judgment explained the principle as follows;

In the administration of government in this country, the functions which are

given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers, because they

are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister

could ever personally attend to them. To make the example of the present case,

no doubt there have been thousands of requisitions in this country by individual

ministries. It cannot be supposed that this regulation meant that in each case,

the minister in person should direct his mind to the matter. The duties imposed

upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under

the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public

business could not be carried on if that were not the case. Constitutionally, the

decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The

minister is responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything

that his officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter

he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected

competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in

Parliament. The whole system of departmental organisation and administration

is based on the view that ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will see that

important duties are committed to experienced officials. If they do not do that,

Parliament is the place where complaint must be made against them". [emphasis

added].

The "Carltona doctrine" applies when a statute grants a power to a Minister, and

it is impractical for the Minister to exercise this power personally. In such cases,

the Minister may generally act through a duly authorized officer without

requiring a formal delegation of power. Under this doctrine, the officer is

19

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

considered an "alter ego" of the Minister, and the officer's decisions are treated

as if they were made by the Minister himself.

This principle was applied in the case of Kuruppu v. Keerthi Rajapakse,

Conservator of Forests,24 wherein Rodrigo, J. quoted the following passage from

De Smiths Judicial Review of Administrative Action25.

Special considerations arise where a statutory power vested in a Minister or a

department of State is exercised by a department official. The official is the alter

ego of the Minister or the Department and since he is subject of as to the fullest

control by his superior, he is not usually spoken of as a delegate The Courts

have recognized that duties imposed on Ministers and the powers given to

Ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the Ministers by

responsible officials of the department In general, therefore, a Minister is

not obliged to bring his own mind to bear upon a matter entrusted to him by

statutes, but act through a duly authorized officer of his department.

In the recent past Courts have further extended the doctrine Carltona principle.

In the case of R. (Chief Constable of West Midlands Police) v. Birmingham

Justices.26 Sedley LJ. held that;

There was a distinction to be drawn between those offices which are the apex

of an organisation itself composed of office-holders or otherwise hierarchically

structured, and those offices designated by Parliament because of the personal

qualifications of the individual holder27. In the former case the subordinate

officers could act on behalf of their superior to whom Parliament had granted

the power and who would take legal responsibility for its exercise. In the latter

only the officer actually empowered could act.

The CGIRs role is defined by the hierarchical structure established by the

statute, rather than by his personal qualifications. Given the many significant

20

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

responsibilities assigned to the CGIR by the statute, it seems inevitable that

minor functions, such as acknowledging appeals, would be delegated.

Furthermore, acknowledging an appeal does not require specialized knowledge

or discretionary judgment; it is simply an administrative task.

In the case of Director of Public Prosecutions v. Haw 28 the concern was whether

in the absence of express statutory authorisation the power could be delegated

by a superior officer to a subordinate officer. Lord Phillips C. J., held;

Where a statutory power is conferred on an officer who is himself the creature

of statute, whether that officer has the power to delegate must depend upon the

interpretation of the relevant statute or statutes. Whether the responsibilities of

the office created by statute are such that delegation is inevitable, there will be

an implied power to delegate. In such circumstances there will be a presumption,

where additional statutory powers and duties are conferred, that there is a power

to delegate unless the statute conferring them, expressly or by implication,

provides to the contrary.

Dr. Sunil F. A. Coorey, in his scholarly work titled Administrative Law in Sri

Lanka29 made the following observations.

There can be cases where statute requires that the exercise of power by one

officer or authority be authenticated certified or communicated by some

particular official, and such authentication, certification or communication has

been in fact done by a different official. Here, the situation is that actual exercise

of power has been by the proper person., but the wrong person has

authenticated, certified, or communicated such exercise of power. In this type of

situation, the law seems to be that as the proper person has in fact exercised the

power in question, its authentication, certification, or communication by the

wrong person does not, for that reason alone, affect the validity of such exercise

of power.

In the case of Lanka Ashok Leyland PLC v. The Commissioner General of Inland

Revenue30 the question as to whether an appeal should be acknowledged by the

CGIR himself was considered and it was held by the numerically equal bench of

this Court that although the statute provides that the appeal has to be submitted

to the CGIR, there is no requirement that the acknowledgement also should be

made by the CGIR himself. His Lordship Janak De Siva, J., having also

considered the application of the Carltona principle, stated on page 6 as follows:

Court is of the view that there is no merit in the submission of the Appellant

that the acknowledgement must be signed by the Respondent. The functions of

the Inland Revenue Department are so multifarious that no Commissioner-

General of Inland Revenue could ever personally attend to all of them. In

particular, Court will be slow to impose such requirements unless there is

unequivocal language in the IR Act. It is true that the appeal has to be submitted

to the respondent. However, that does not mean that the acknowledgement to be

made by the respondent. Similar approach has been taken by our Courts in

applying the Carltona principle in relation to administrative functions to be

performed by Ministers (M.S.Perera v. Forest Department and another [(1982)

1 Sri. L.R. 187] and Kuruppu v. Keerthir Rajapakse, Conservator of Forests

[(1982) 1 Sri. L.R. 163].

At this point, it is also relevant to determine whether acknowledging an appeal

is a statutory duty that falls directly on the CGIR himself.

The issue of acknowledging an appeal arises from Section 165(6) of the Act.

This section specifies the timeframe within which an appeal must be

acknowledged and states that if acknowledgment does not occur within this

period, the appeal is deemed to have been acknowledged on the day it was

delivered to the CGIR. However, Section 165(6) does not explicitly state that the

acknowledgment must be carried out by the CGIR personally. In contrast, the

proviso to Section 165 (1), 165 (4) and Sections 165 (7), 165 (8), 165 (9), 165

30 CA TAX 14/2017.

22

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

(10), 165 (11), 165 (12), 165 (13), 165 (14) and 165 (15) specifically outline

functions that the CGIR must perform.

It is well-established law that a Court cannot add or read words into a statute. As

previously mentioned in this judgment, the role of the Courts is to interpret the

law, not to create legislation. Such legislative functions are solely within the

prerogative of the legislature.

On reading words into a statute, Bindra states that:31

It is not open to add to the words of the statute or to read more in the words

than is meant, for that would be legislating and not interpreting a legislation. If

the language of a statutory provision is plain, the Court is not entitled to read

something in it which is not there, or to add any word or to subtract anything

from it.

Therefore, I am unable to conclude that acknowledging an appeal is a function

of the CGIR himself or only by an officer authorized under the IR Act, without

reading additional words into Section 165 of the IR Act.

Another argument advanced by the learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant

is that the Carltona principle, a principle of English constitutional law, has no

application where there is a statutory power of delegation32. He cited the

following statement of Lord Woolf, Sir Jeffrey Jowell, Catherine Donnelly and

Ivan Hare(eds), in De Smiths Judicial Review [London: Sweet & Maxwell,8th

edn.,2018], at p.36,

The Carltona principal may be expressly excluded by legislation, but whether it

may in addition be excluded by statutory implication remains uncertain. Two

situations should be distinguished. Where a power of delegation is expressly

conferred by Parliament on a minister, it may compel the inference that

Parliament intended to restrict the devolution of power to the statutory method,

thus impliedly excluding the Carltona principle. Commonwealth authority,

31 N. S. Bindra, Interpretation of Statutes, Eighth Edition, 1997. at p.452.

32 At paragraph 66 of the preliminary written submissions filed by the Appellant.

23

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

however, suggests that such an implication will not readily be drawn. It has also

been suggested that the principle may be impliedly excluded where it appears

inconsistent with the intention of Parliament as evinced by a statutory framework

of power and responsibilities.

However, in this instance, the statute does not explicitly provide for such an

exclusion. Section 165(1) and (2) states that an appeal should be preferred to the

CGIR, and Section 165(6) does not stipulate that the appeal must be

acknowledged by the CGIR personally. If the Legislature intended this

requirement, it would have explicitly included it. Therefore, in my view,

inferring such an implication would involve adding words to the statute, which

is not permissible. Furthermore, as previously stated, Section 208(4) excludes an

Assessor only from performing functions under Sections 163 and 165(7),

without written approval. This means that the statutory exclusion without written

approval applies solely to these specific functions and not to others. Section

208(8) pertains to the powers, duties, or functions conferred or imposed on the

Commissioner-General by any provision of the IR Act. As mentioned earlier, the

acknowledgment of an appeal is not a function assigned to the Commissioner-

General by the IR Act. Consequently, the definition of Commissioner-General

in Section 217 too is also not relevant to the issue at hand. Moreover, the

definition uses the word includes to expand the term Commissioner General

to encompass the named officers within the Act, indicating that the interpretation

is not restrictive.

On the above issue in our own judgment in Polycrome Electrical Industries (Pvt)

Ltd v. The Commissioner General of Inland Revenue33 Dr. Ruwan Fernando J.

(with whom I concurred) dealing with delegation of authority cited the following

extract from the Indian Supreme Court decision in the case of Sidhartha

Sarawagi v. Board of trustees for the Port of Kolkata and others34

33 CA. TAX 0049/2019. 34 [2014] 16 SCC 248.

24

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

Delegation is the act of making or commissioning a delegate. It generally

means of powers by the person who grants the delegation and conferring of an

authority to do things which otherwise that person would have to do himself.

Delegation is defined in Blacks Law Dictionary as the act of entrusting another

with authority by empowering another to act as an agent or representative.

Delegation generally means parting of powers by the person who grants the

delegation, but it also means conferring of an authority to do things which

otherwise that person would have to do himself. (emphasis added)

In light of the above analysis, I am of the view that the acknowledgment of an

appeal is not necessarily an act that must be performed personally by the CGIR

or require formal delegation to another officer for this purpose. Given the large

number of taxpayers in Sri Lanka, it would be impractical for the CGIR to

personally acknowledge each appeal.

Moreover, in the acknowledgment signed by Assistant Commissioner K.K.J.C.

Deshapriya35, he states that he was directed by the CGIR, pursuant to Section

165(7) of the Inland Revenue Act, to conduct further inquiries into the appeal.

Without causing prejudice to the conclusion above, I would state that

acknowledging an appeal is a procedural step in the process of making further

inquiries into the appeal made to the CGIR.

Therefore, I conclude that an Assistant Commissioner who acknowledges an

appeal based on directions from the CGIR under Section 165(7) of the Inland

Revenue Act is acting within legal bounds. Since acknowledgment is essentially

an administrative task, the most reasonable inference is that the Assistant

Commissioner acted under an implied delegation of authority from the CGIR.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Appellant also argued that the letter of

acknowledgment36 clearly indicates that the date of acknowledgment is 22nd

December 201437. He relied on the first paragraph of the letter, which states, "I

35 At page 90 of the appeal brief. 36 At page 90 of the appeal brief. 37 At paragraphs 68,69, and 70 of the final Written submissions filed by the Appellant.

25

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

hereby acknowledge the receipt of your appeal made by the letter of 22/12/2014

against the income tax assessment issued for the year of assessment 2011/2012."

However, I am not inclined to accept this submission on behalf of the Appellant.

The letter merely acknowledges the "receipt" of the appeal on 22nd December

2014. It cannot be considered the date of acknowledgment as per Section 165(6)

of the IR Act.

The Appellant contends that, due to the lack of a proper acknowledgment of the

appeal, the appeal should be considered as having been received by the CGIR on

22nd December 2014, which is the date it was delivered to the CGIR.

However, based on the above analysis, I find that the appeal was properly

acknowledged by the Assistant Commissioners letter dated 5thJanuary 2015.

The CGIR made his determination on 27th December 2016, which is within the

required two-year period.

The Appellant contended that they only received the CGIRs determination on

the 30th December 201638. Section 165(6) stipulates that if an appeal is

acknowledged within thirty days of its receipt, the date on the acknowledgment

letter shall be considered the date of receipt of the appeal. Section 165 (14) states

that the CGIR must determine every Petition of appeal within two years from the

date of its receipt. Therefore, the actual date on which the Appellant received the

determination is irrelevant.

Therefore, I conclude that the CGIR's determination is not time-barred under

Section 165(14) of the Inland Revenue Act and answer the fourth question of

law in the negative, in favour of the Respondent.

(v) In view of the facts and circumstances relating to the case has the

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue erred in law in coming to the

conclusion that he did?

26

CA No. CA/TAX/0043/2023 TAC/IT/036/2017

In view of the answers provided to Questions (i) to (iv), I answer this question

in the negative, in favour of the Respondent.

Conclusion

Based on the preceding analysis of the facts and applicable law in this case, I

conclude that the TAC did not err in determining that the Appellant failed to

qualify for the income tax exemption under Section 13(ddd) of the IR Act.

Additionally, the determination by the CGIR is not time-barred.

Accordingly, I answer all five questions of law in the negative, in favor of the

Respondent.

1. No

2. No

3. No

4. No

5. No

In light of the answers given to the five questions of law, acting under Section

11 A (6) of the Tax Appeals Commission Act No. 23 of 2011, as amended, I

affirm the determination made by the TAC and dismiss this appeal.

The registrar is directed to send a certified copy of this judgment to the secretary

of the TAC.
