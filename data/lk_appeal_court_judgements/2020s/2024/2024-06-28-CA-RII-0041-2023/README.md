Introduction

The Plaintiff - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) instituted case No. DRE/37/2008 in the District Court of Colombo

4

CA/RII/0041/2023

inter alia claiming for the possession of the land and premises described in the

schedule to the plaint and for damages.

The Defendant - Petitioner - Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner)

sought, inter alia to have the Defendant declared the owner of the property and to

dismiss the plaint.

After the trial, the learned Additional District Judge of Colombo dismissed the plaint

in his judgment dated 17th January 2014 and declared that the Defendant is entitled

to remain on the property.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the Respondent appealed to the Civil

Appellate High Court of Colombo (High Court exercising jurisdiction in terms of

the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of

2006, commonly known as the Civil Appellate High Court but not named as such

in any statute), where the case was allocated No. WP/HCCA/COL/244/2014 (F).

After arguments, the learned High Court Judge, in his judgment dated 13th

November 2018, allowed the appeal, and set aside the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge. Accordingly, the judgment was entered in favour of the

Plaintiff as prayed for in the plaint.

The Defendant did not seek leave to appeal from the Supreme Court against the said

judgment in terms of Section 5C of the High Court of the Provinces (Special

Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of 2006. Consequently, the record was

remitted back to the District Court of Colombo, and the Respondent made an

application for the execution of the judgment to evict the Petitioner from the corpus.

The Petitioner moved to refuse the Respondent's application, and the Respondent

filed objections to the Petitioner's application.

The Petitioners objections to the execution of the judgment of the Civil Appellate

High Court were based on the argument that the answers to the issues by the Civil

Appellate High Court had made the judgment ambiguous and, therefore,

5

CA/RII/0041/2023

inexecutable. Subsequently, both parties filed their written submissions on the issue,

and the learned District Judge delivered her order on 8th June 2023, allowing the

Respondent's application for the execution of the judgment of the Civil Appellate

High Court.

The Respondent instituted proceedings in this Court, inter alia, seeking to set aside

and/or vary/revise the order of the learned District Judge dated 8th June 2023 and to

set aside the judgment of the Civil Appellate High Court of Colombo dated 13th

November 2018.

Analysis

As I have already stated above the learned District Judge in his judgement held in

favour of the Petitioner and dismissed the Respondents action. In the judgement,

the learned District Judge answered all sixteen issues. In essence the learned

District Judge held that the lease agreement A1 is not a valid deed of lease. He

answered issues No. 1,2,3,7 and 8 on the said footing.

He answered issue No. 13 in favour of the Petitioner, granting the reliefs prayed for

in the Petitioners answer.

Issue No. 9 was also answered in favour of the Petitioner holding that the Petitioner

is in possession not as the Respondents licensee but under an independent title. The

learned District Judge observed that the Petitioners mother executed a deed of

transfer in favour of one Kumuduni Chamali Perera as security for a loan obtained

by her, and that the transferee did not intend to transfer the beneficial interests to

the transferor. Consequently, the learned District Judge held that all the Petitioner

acquires from the deed executed by Kumuduni Chamali Perera in his favour are the

rights that Kumuduni Chamali Perera had, and nothing more. The obvious

conclusion of the learned District Judge is that Kumuduni Chamali Perera was

holding the property on a constructive trust for the Petitioners mother.

Consequently, the Petitioner was declared the owner of the property.

6

CA/RII/0041/2023

In the appeal, the learned High Court Judge overturned the judgment of the learned

District Judge and concluded that there is no evidence to establish that Kumuduni

Chamali Perera holds the land subject to a constructive trust. Consequently, the

learned High Court Judge held that it was an outright transfer by Kumuduni Chamali

Perera in favour of the Respondent, and that the Respondent had allowed the

Petitioner to remain in the property for three years under a lease agreement.

The learned High Court Judge allowed the appeal and set aside the judgment of the

learned District Judge. Accordingly, the judgment was entered in favour of the

Plaintiff as prayed for in the plaint. However, in the judgment, the learned High

Court Judge did not overturn the answers given by the learned District Judge to

issues No. 2 to 6 and 10 to 16; these were allowed to stand. The learned High Court

Judge set aside the answers to issues 1, 7, 8, and 9 only, and these were answered in

the following manner:

The first issue, which the learned District Judge answered as not a valid lease

agreement, was answered by the High Court Judge as Yes, suggesting that there

is a valid lease agreement between the Petitioner and the Respondent.

The second issue, concerning whether the lease period ended on 30th September,

2007, which the learned District Judge answered as not a valid lease agreement,

remained unchanged. In contrast, the learned High Court Judge set aside the answer

to issue No. 7 and answered it as No, which aligns with the learned District Judges

determination that there was not a valid lease agreement. Issue No. 8, which the

learned District Judge answered as not a valid lease agreement, was answered by

the High Court Judge as No. The answer to issues No. 7 and 8 contradicts the

answer given by the learned High Court Judge to issue No. 1.

The other issue that was reconsidered and freshly answered by the learned High

Court Judge, overturning the decision of the learned District Judge, pertains to issue

No. 9. This issue concerns whether the Petitioner is in possession of the property

7

CA/RII/0041/2023

with or without the leave and license of the Respondent. The learned High Court

Judge answered this issue negatively, in contrast to the affirmative answer given by

the learned District Judge.

The learned High Court Judge, while holding that the Petitioners possession is not

based on an independent title by answering issue No. 9 in the negative, allowed to

stand the answer given by the learned District Judge to issue No. 4. According to

this answer, the possession of the Petitioner, even after the expiry of the lease, is not

deemed unlawful or unauthorized.

The answer to issue No. 11 by the learned District Judge, which the learned High

Court Judge allowed to remain unchanged, suggests that the Petitioner is not bound

to honour the notice to quit sent by the Respondents Attorney-at-Law.

The answer to issue No. 12 by the learned District Judge is based on the premise

that the Respondent has failed to disclose a cause of action against the Petitioner.

Consequently, although the learned High Court Judge ultimately held in favour of

the Respondent, the answers to the aforementioned issues are inconsistent with this

final conclusion.

More importantly, the answers to issues No. 6 and 13 by the learned District Judge,

which the learned High Court Judge allowed to remain unchanged, state that the

Petitioner is entitled to the reliefs claimed in the answer and that the Respondent is

not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the plaint. Accordingly, these two answers

contradict the final conclusion of the learned High Court Judge and therefore, cannot

be upheld as they stand.

Nevertheless, neither party sought leave to appeal from the Supreme Court against

the judgment of the learned High Court Judge. Consequently, the Respondent

applied to the District Court to enforce the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge, which was objected to by the Petitioner. The Petitioner raised the

aforementioned defects in the judgment of the learned High Court Judge before the

8

CA/RII/0041/2023

District Judge. The learned District Judge correctly determined that the District

Court, being the lower court, lacks the authority to reconsider the judgment of the

superior court, and therefore declined to make an order in that regard. Consequently,

by her order dated 8th June 2023, the learned District Judge rejected the objections

raised by the Petitioner and granted the Respondent's application to execute the writ

of possession.

In the instant application the Petitioner seeks to set aside and/or vary/revise the order

of the learned District Judge dated 8th June 2023 and also to set aside the judgement

of the learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge dated 13th November 2018.

Based on its merits, I do not perceive any valid reason to interfere with the decision

of the learned District Judge dated 8th June 2023. However, it must be acknowledged

that this order stems from the disputed judgment of the learned High Court Judge.

Nevertheless, considering the analysis above, it is evident that there are significant

errors in the judgment of the learned High Court Judge, rendering it ineffective.

Allowing this judgment to stand would result in a serious miscarriage of justice,

which justifies setting it aside.

The Petitioner has brought this application before this Court seeking restitutio in

integrum under Article 138 of the Constitution. Article 138(1) confers upon this

Court the exclusive jurisdiction to grant relief through restitutio in integrum.

Under Roman law, restitutio in integrum was a remedy aimed at removing legal

disadvantages that had occurred, providing protection against injustice arising from

the practical impossibility of foreseeing all circumstances in advance. Restitution

aims to restore a party to their original legal position, which they were deprived of

by operation of law.

9

CA/RII/0041/2023

A party seeking restitution must act promptly1. If a party has acquiesced or approved

of defective proceedings through their conduct, Courts typically refrain from setting

aside those proceedings. The Court, in exercising its jurisdiction of restitutio in

integrum, does not relieve parties of the consequences of their own errors,

negligence, or laches2. Furthermore, in my view, restitutio in integrum is a special

jurisdiction exercised by this Court in distinct contexts and should not be a substitute

for an appeal or a revision application.

As previously stated in this judgment, neither the Petitioner nor the Respondent

pursued their right of appeal to the Supreme Court with leave obtained. Therefore,

I am of the view that there has been negligence on the part of the Petitioner.

Furthermore, this application was made to this Court on the 12th October 2023,

seeking, inter alia, to set aside the judgment of the High Court Judge dated 13th

November 2018.

According to the judgment of this Court in the case of Saheeda Umma and another

v. Haniffa and others3, an application for restitutio in integrum is considered an

action under section 11 of Prescription Ordinance No. 22 of 1871, as amended, and

is subject to a three-year limitation period. Accordingly, the Petitioner's application

to set aside the judgment of the learned High Court Judge through restitutio in

integrum is time-barred.

Nevertheless, as previously mentioned in this judgment, the impugned decision of

the learned High Court Judge cannot be upheld under any circumstances.

As I have already stated, the Petitioner's application to this Court was submitted

after a substantial delay. This delay affects the exercise of the Court's revisionary

jurisdiction. Nevertheless, it had been held in the case of Caroline Nona and others

1 Babun Appu v. Simon Appu, 11 NLR 44. 2 Don Lewis v. Dissanayake, 70 NLR 8. 3 [1999] 1 Sri L.R. 150.

10

CA/RII/0041/2023

v. Pedrick Singho and others4 that the question whether delay is fatal to an

application in revision depends on the facts and circumstances of the case. If the

impugned order or that part of the judgement is manifestly erroneous and is likely

to cause grave injustice, the Court should not reject the application on the ground

of delay alone.

Further, it was held that whenever the order challenged disclose a miscarriage of

justice which shocks the conscience of Court and it had deprived a right of a party,

justice of the case requires the use of the discretion of Court to excuse the delay in

coming to court5.

As it was stated by Sansoni C.J. in Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed6 the object

of the power of revision is nothing else but the due administration of justice.

In the case of Somawathi v. Madawala and others7 (S.C.) His Lordship Justice Soza

observed that, The Court will not hesitate to use its revisionary powers to give

relief where a miscarriage of justice has occurred. () a miscarriage of justice

results as here, then this Court will not sit idly by. Indeed, the facts of this case cry

aloud for the intervention of this Court to prevent what otherwise would be a

miscarriage of justice.

In my view, the statement made by Justice Soza in the case is equally relevant to the

current situation.

In the aforementioned case of Saheeda Umma and another v. Haniffa and others8,

this Court exercised its extraordinary powers of revision despite the application for

restitutio in integrum being time-barred.

CA/RII/0041/2023

Article 138(1) of the Constitution, as it stands currently, reads as follows:

138(1): The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the provisions of

the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all

errors in fact or in law which shall be committed by the High Court, in the exercise

of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance, tribunal

or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision

and restitutio in integrum, of all causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and

things of which such High Court, Court of First Instance, tribunal or other

institution may have taken cognizance: (emphasis added)

Provided that no judgement, decree, or order of any Court shall be revised or varied

on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not prejudiced the

substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice.

In the case of Gunawardane and others v. Muthukumarana and others9 (S.C.)

Aluwihare J., interpreted Articles 138 and 154 P (3) of the Constitution in

conjunction with the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19

of 1990. His Lordship held that despite the removal of the Court of Appeal's

appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the Provincial High Court and the granting

of a right of appeal to the Supreme Court under section 9 of the Act, did not

eliminate or undermine the Court of Appeal's revisionary jurisdiction over such

decisions.

The High Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) (Amendment) Act No. 54 of

2006 similarly provides in section 5C (1) that appeals from the District Court to the

High Court confer a right of appeal to the Supreme Court. Therefore, the

aforementioned judgment of the Supreme Court should apply equally to the Civil

Appellate High Courts as well. Consequently, under Article 138(1) of the

9 (2020) 3 Sri.L.R.306.

12

CA/RII/0041/2023

Constitution, the Court of Appeal retains revisionary jurisdiction over decisions of

both the District Court and the Civil Appellate High Court.

Conclusion

In light of the analysis provided above in this judgment, it is my considered view

that a strong case for the interferences of this Court have been made out by the

Petitioner and there are sufficient exceptional circumstances warranting the exercise

of Court's revisionary powers. Allowing the judgment of the learned High Court

Judge dated 13th November 2018 to stand would result in a serious miscarriage of

justice. Therefore, I set aside the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated

13th November 2018 and direct the present judges of the Civil Appellate High Court

of Colombo to reconsider the judgment of the learned District Judge dated 17th

January 2014 and deliver a fresh judgment expeditiously, addressing all the issues.

Consequently, I also set aside the order made by the learned District Judge on 8th

June 2023, which was based on the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated

13th November 2018.

Parties shall bear their own costs.
