WICKUM A. KALUARACHCHI, J. This bail application has been filed to obtain bail to the suspect

Mohommed Zanoon Mohomed Naslin who had been produced to the

Magistrate Court of Maligakanda as a suspect under the provisions of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.

He had been arrested on 07.06.2022 for the offences of possessing and

trafficking of a gross quantity of 1 kilogram and 192 grams of

Diacetylmorphine (Heroine). According to the Government Analyst Report,

the net quantity of Heroine is 690.3 grams. The learned Counsel for the

respondent informed that on 22.07.2024, the indictment was signed by

the Hon. Attorney General and now it has reached the Colombo High

Court.

According to Section 83(2) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance as amended by the Act No. 41 of 2022, when the pure quantity

of Heroin is 10 grams or above the suspect shall not be released on bail

except by the Court of Appeal in exceptional circumstances. Section 84 of

the amended Act states that no suspect brought under Section 54A and

Section 54B shall be detained for more than 12 months in custody.

However, the said 12 months period does not apply to the matter in the

Cout of Appeal according to Section 83(2) of the amended Act. Therefore,

the petitioner must satisfy this Court that there are special circumstances

to grant bail. Exceptional circumstances differ from case to case. On the

facts and circumstances of each case, it has to be considered whether

there are special circumstances.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner pointed out two matters as special

circumstances. Firstly, he pointed out that the suspect was in remand for

more than two years. Secondly, the learned Counsel contended that the

suspect has been illegally detained.

As this suspect was arrested for possessing and trafficking 690.3 grams of

heroin, a high quantity of illegal substances is involved in this case. As the

suspect is indicted by now, there is no oppressive or excessive delay in this

matter. Therefore, the period of remand alone cannot be considered as an

exceptional circumstance.

The argument of illegal detention is based on Section 120 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act. The learned Counsel contended that at the end of

every fifteen days, the period of remand has to be extended and, in this

case, after the suspect was produced before the Maligakanda Magistrate

Court on 21st November 2023, the suspect has been remanded until 7th

October 2024. Submitting judicial authorities, the learned Counsel

contended that remanding a person more than fifteen days without

extending the remand is illegal and against the procedure established by

law. The learned State Counsel contended by drawing the attention to

Section 120 and 115 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act (CCPA) that

the extension of remand in fifteen days is required only during the

investigation stage.

Section 120(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act reads as follows:

Every investigation under this Chapter shall be completed without

unnecessary delay. Where such investigation cannot be completed within

fifteen days the officer in charge of the police station or the inquirer shall

transmit to the Magistrate's Court having jurisdiction in the case, a report of

the facts and the progress of the investigation at the end of the fifteen days

and thereafter at the end of every period of fifteen days until completion of

the investigation.

It is clear from the above subsection that remand extension at the end of

every fifteen days is required until the investigations are completed. In the

matter before us, investigations have been completed and the IB extracts

Page 5 of 6

had been sent to the Hon. Attorney General to indict the suspect.

Thereafter, the learned Magistrate has directed to produce the suspect

physically on 7th October 2024 before the Magistrate Court. It is to be

noted that when the matter is referred to the Hon. Attorney General to

indict the suspect according to the quantity mentioned in the Government

Analyst Report, the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to deal with the suspect.

Section 115(2) reads as follows:

The Magistrate before whom a suspect is forwarded under this section, if

he is satisfied that it is expedient to detain the suspect in custody pending

further investigation, may after recording his reasons, by warrant

addressed to the superintendent of any prison authorize the detention of the

suspect for a total period of fifteen days and no more. The provisions of

section 264 shall apply to every such warrant. If at the end of the said period

of fifteen days proceedings are not instituted the Magistrate may subject to

subsection (3) either discharge the suspect or require him to execute a bond

to appear if and when so required.

In the instant matter, the learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to release

the suspect on bail. As this is a case referred to the Attorney General to

indict the suspect, it is obvious that the learned Magistrate cannot

discharge the suspect. Therefore, the learned Magistrate could not take

any step in terms of 115(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. The law

requires to extend the period of remand every fifteen days until the

investigations are completed and after completing investigations, no such

requirement is specified in the CCPA. Hence, not extending the period of

remand in fifteen days after completing the investigations is not an illegal

detention. In any case, if there is an issue of illegal detention, the Supreme

Court is the appropriate forum to raise it.

In the circumstances, we find no exceptional circumstances to consider

bail in this matter. Accordingly, the instant bail application is dismissed.
