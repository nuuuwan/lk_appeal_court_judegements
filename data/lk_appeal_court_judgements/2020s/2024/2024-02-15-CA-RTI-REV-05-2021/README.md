(A) Preliminary matters:

The Preamble to the Right to Information Act No. 16 of 2016 says,

AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION;

TO SPECIFY GROUNDS ON WHICH ACCESS MAY BE DENIED; TO

ESTABLISH THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION COMMISSION; TO APPOINT

INFORMATION OFFICERS; TO SET OUT THE PROCEDURE AND FOR

MATTERS CONNECTED THEREWITH OR INCIDENTAL THERETO.

WHEREAS the Constitution guarantees the right of access to information

in Article 14A thereof and there exists a need to foster a culture of

transparency and accountability in public authorities by giving effect to

the right of access to information and thereby promote a society in which

the people of Sri Lanka would be able to more fully participate in public

life through combating corruption and promoting accountability and good

governance.

Article 14A of the Constitution says,

14A. (1) Every citizen shall have the right of access to any information as

provided for by law, being information that is required for the exercise or

protection of a citizens right held by:-

(a) the State, a Ministry or any Government Department or any

statutory body established or created by or under any law;

(b) any Ministry of a Minister of the Board of Ministers of a Province

or any Department or any statutory body established or created by

a statute of a Provincial Council;

(c) any local authority; and

(d) any other person, who is in possession of such information

relating to any institution referred to in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) or (c)

of this paragraph.

(2) No restrictions shall be placed on the right declared and recognized

by this Article, other than such restrictions prescribed by law as are

necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national

security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of

disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals and of the

reputation or the rights of others, privacy, prevention of contempt of

court, protection of parliamentary privilege, for preventing the

disclosure of information communicated in confidence, or for

maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

(3) In this Article, citizen includes a body whether incorporated or

unincorporated, if not less than three-fourths of the members of such body

are citizens.

The 02nd respondent, S. M. Pasansani Anuradha applied for the post of Trainee

Staff Assistant of the Bank of Ceylon, the petitioner on 28th November 2016. The

4 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

island wide competitive examination conducted by the Department of

Examinations was held on 18th March 2017. 11,708 candidates were shortlisted.

The petitioner was not among them. But she passed the examination. So, all

candidates who passed were not shortlisted. She has not obtained sufficient

marks under the District Merit List for her district is the Banks position. 1045

candidates were selected for interviews from that district (Galle). Out of that 1045

a number of 64 were selected for appointment. Pasansani made an appeal to the

Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (Ombudsman).

Having inquired from the Bank the Ombudsman informed Pasansani (what she has

already been told either expressly or impliedly) that she did not reach the required district

merit level for recruitment. On 16th September 2019 (nearly three years after her initial

application) Pasansani wrote to the Right to Information Commission. She

requested, the following information from the Information Officer,

(i) The mark sheets of applicants for the competitive examination published

on the Banks website on 13th November 2017,

(ii) The interview marks and the merit list of 11708 applicants who faced the

interview,

(iii) Marks at the examination and marks given on the order of merit to all

applicants from Galle District,

(iv) The list of applicants who have been recruited on district merit,

(v) The particulars of applicants within that district who failed to assume

duties although selected

(vi) The dates on which successors were selected for such vacancies and their

list

The Banks Information Officer sent following responses in respect of each query,

(i) The results of the examination published on 13th November 2017 could

be known in respect of a candidate, to that candidate only, limited to the

information that he or she is successful at the examination or not,

(ii) The private information of candidates, will not be issued in terms of

section 5(1)(a) of Right to Information Act No. 16 of 2016,

(iii) Same as in (ii),

(iv) Same as in (iii),

(v) We do not have such information,

(vi) Successors have not been recruited

Pasansani then requested for an additional information. If successors (for the

vacancies created by those selected not accepting appointment) have not been appointed, how

could 1700 vacancies be filled.

The Information Officer replied, that, as certain persons selected did not accept

appointment, a number less than 1700 were appointed.

Pasansani appealed to the Right to Information Commission on 20th November

2020. The Commission on 06th October 2021 gave its order directing the Bank

to provide the information. The Bank came before this Court in appeal on 25th

November 2021.

(B) Preliminary Objections by Appellant (Bank) and Respondent

(Pasansani):

(i) No valid order by the Right to Information Commission (raised for

the Bank):

The learned Presidents Counsel for the Bank has taken up the position, that,

there is no valid order made by the Right to Information Commission.

He refers to section 12(1) of the Right to Information Act, which says,

12. (1) The Commission shall consist of five persons appointed by

the President upon the recommendation of the Constitutional

Council. In making such recommendations, the Constitutional Council

shall recommend one person nominated by each of the following

organisations or categories of organisations:

6 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

(a) Bar Association of Sri Lanka which shall nominate an Attorney-at-Law

of eminence or a Legal Academic in consultation with Attorneys -at-Law

and Legal Academia;

(b) organizations of publishers, editors and media persons;

(c) other civil society organizations.

At the relevant time, the Members of the Commission were as follows,

1. Mr. Mahinda Gammanpila - Chairman

2. Justice Rohini Walgama Rtd. - Commissioner

3. Kishali Pinto Jayawardena Attorney at Law Commissioner

4. S. G. Punchihewa - Commissioner

5. Dr. Selvi Thiruchandran Commissioner

But when making the impugned order Dr. Selvi Thiruchandran was not present.

Only Nos. 01 to 04 has signed.

As the section says, The Commission shall consist of five persons it is

argued, that, the order is not valid.

However, the Bank also accepts, that, there is a provision in the schedule

to the Act which says that the quorum for any meeting shall be three

members.

The said schedule is titled SCHEDULE [Section 12(8)] PROVISIONS RELATING

TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION.

Section (7)(b) of the schedule says,

(b) The quorum for any meeting of the Commission shall be three

Members.

The position of the Bank is, that, the quorum specifically relates to

administrative functions (the day to day management and operation) but for its quasi

judicial functions all Members shall participate.

7 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

The Bank relies upon the cases,

(i) Jayasinghe and others vs. R. S. Jayaratne, Secretary, Ministry of

Public Administration and others (1999) 2 SLR 385. It was decided in

that case,

The view that the function of the Commission upon a reference under

section 12 is not simply to record evidence is supported by another

consideration. Section "2 of the Act establishes the Commission as a body

corporate, which "shall" consist of five members. It would appear that the

Commission must act through all its members, because the Act makes

provision neither for a quorum nor for the delegation of the powers of the

Commission to one or more of its members; section 7 only enables the

Commission to act notwithstanding a vacancy or a defect in the

appointment of a member. The purpose of a reference under section 12

was thus to enable this Court to obtain the benefit of the collective

wisdom of all the members of the Commission, and not just its notes of

Investigation1. (page 393) [It was about a matter that the court referred

to the Human Rights Commission to obtain its views]

(ii) Paskaralingam by his Attorney at Law vs. P. R. P. Perera and others

(1998) 2 SLR 169. It was said in that case,

What is repugnant to the principles of natural justice is that only two

out of the three Commissioners who held the inquiry chose to express

their views. Such a report cannot, in my view, be considered a report of

the Commission, as contemplated by law2. (page 189) [It was a case

about a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry]

However Wijetunge J., at page 188 said, that, in Wijerama vs. Paul 76 N.L.R

241 the then Court of Appeal has observed, that,

1 Mark D. H. Fernando J., with Gunasekera J. and Weerasekera J. 2 Judgment of Wijetunge J. It contains judgment of G. P. S. de Silva, Chief Justice and Gunasekera J.

8 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

"the phenomenon of one judge acting on evidence taken before another

is not one wholly repugnant to our law, and our legislators have

themselves recognised (see eg. sections 88 of the Courts Ordinance and

292 of the Criminal Procedure Code) the acceptability of decisions reached

in that way".

Further, it is argued, that, even though the Human Rights Commission of Sri

Lanka Act No. 21 of 1996 does not provide for a quorum, or for the delegation of

the powers of the Commission, the Right to Information Act has specific provision

for delegation. Sections (5)(a) and (5)(b) of the schedule says,

(5) (a) Where a member of the Commission, is temporarily unable to

discharge his or her duty due to ill health, absence from Sri Lanka or for

any other cause, the President may on the recommendation of the

Constitutional Council, appoint another person to act in place of such

member during his or her absence.

(b) Where the Chairperson of the Commission, is temporarily unable to

discharge his or her duty due to ill health, absence from Sri Lanka or for

any other cause, the President shall appoint another member of the

Commission, to act in place of such Chairperson during his or her

absence.

The position of Pasansani appearing through her learned counsel was, that, in

terms of section 12(8) of the Act the provisions of the schedule to the Act shall

apply in respect of the members of the Commission and the conduct of its

meetings.

Section 12(8) says,

(8) The provisions of the Schedule to this Act shall apply to and in

respect of the members of the Commission and the conduct of its

meetings.

9 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

In regard to Paskaralingams case, it is submitted, that, it was a matter under

the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry Law No. 07 of 1978 and three

commissioners heard the matter but only two of them signed the order (the late

Justice Frederick Ninian Dimitri Jayasuriya was absent due to ill health).

On behalf of Pasansani, it is submitted, that, the Special Presidential

Commission of Inquiry Law did not provide for a quorum.

In respect of Jayasinghes case, it is submitted, that, whereas it was a case in

which the Supreme Court during the course of a fundamental rights application

referred the matter to the Human Rights Commission, the Human Rights

Commission Act provided, that, the commission shall consist of five members

and it did not provide for a quorum. The Supreme Court, in Jayasinghes case

has said as follows,

It would appear that the Commission must act through all its

members, because the Act makes provision neither for a quorum nor

for the delegation of the powers of the Commission to one or more of

its members;

Hence it appears to this Court, that, whereas the Special Presidential

Commission of Inquiry Act and the Human Right Commission Act did not provide

for a quorum, the Right to Information Act provided so. It also appears, that, the

Right to Information Act provides for acting appointments in section 5(a) and (b).

Although it is not alleged in this case, that, there was an acting appointment for

Dr. Selvi Thiruchandran, it is also not said, that, she was absent due to ill health,

absence from Sri Lanka or for any other cause. In any event, this Court is of the

view, that the quorum of 03 members provided is not only for administrative

functions but for judicial or quasi judicial functions too. In the absence of such

differentiation of functions in the Act this Court will be reading into the

provisions of the Act, which this Court cannot do, if it is decided, that, quorum

of 03 members is only for the administrative functions, but not for judicial or

quasi judicial functions.

10 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

Hence this Court decides, that, an order signed by 03 members or more is

a valid order. The order in question in this case has been signed by 04

members and hence it is valid.

(ii)The Banks appeal is out of time (raised for Pasansani):

The next question is one raised for and on behalf of Pasansani, that, the Banks

appeal to this Court is out of time.

Section 34(1) of the Act says,

34. (1) A citizen or public authority who is aggrieved by the decision of

the Commission made under section 32, may appeal against such decision

to the Court of Appeal within one month of the date on which such decision

was communicated to such citizen or public authority.

It is submitted, that, on the basis, that, it received the order in question on

25.10.2021, the Bank has appealed. The petition of the Bank to this Court is

dated 25.11.2021.

It is further submitted, that, however, as evident from P.12 the order was made

on 27.07.2021 at the hearing of the appeal and the Deputy General Manager of

the Bank was present in person.

There is no denial by the Bank that when the order was made on 27.07.2021 it

was present before the commission. The section says,

may appeal against such decision to the Court of Appeal within one

month of the date on which such decision was communicated

This is not and at least not only a case in which the order was not communicated

verbally in the presence of the parties, but sent in writing only. The section says

communicated. Communication is fundamentally by one person to another

where both are physically present at the same place and time. If they are not

present at the same place, (but same time) the communication could be over the

telephone or the internet. When the place and time both do not coincide for the

11 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

two persons the communication can be by way of a writing. Furthermore, the

word communication if there is no qualification to that word means in so far

as time is concerned, the first time it was done. Hence the communication in

this case is on 27.07.2021 and the Bank should have come before this Court in

appeal at least by 27.08.2021.

It was said by Millet L. J., in Petch vs. Gurney (Inspector of Taxes) [1994] 3

All E R 731 that,

Unless the court is given a power to extend the time, or some other and

final mandatory time limit can be spelled out of the statute, a time limit

cannot be relaxed without being dispensed with altogether and it cannot

be dispensed with altogether unless the substantive requirement itself can

be dispensed with.

Although it was a tax case, the principle that unless the legislature has given the

court the power to extend the time it cannot do it is a universal rule.

In the 163 year old case of Liverpool Borough Bank vs. Turner, on 21st of July

1860 Vice Chancellor Sir W. Page Wood said, among other things, that,

An analogous difficulty presents itself here in the question whether the

Merchant Shipping Act 1854 having omitted the prohibitory words

otherwise such transfer shall not be valid or effectual for any purpose

whatever, either in law or in equity, is to be considered as mandatory or

merely directory with respect to the mode which it prescribes for carrying

contracts into effect; because, if the Legislature enacts that a

transaction must be carried out in a particular way, the words that

otherwise it shall be invalid at law and in equity are mere

surplusage3. (page 707)

3 excessive or nonessential matter

12 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

However, in the case of PETITIONER: WILLIE (WILLIAM) SLANEY Vs.

RESPONDENT: THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH. DATE OF JUDGMENT:

31/10/19554, in the Supreme Court of India, in which case too the case of

Howard vs. Boddington was referred to (the Bench comprised of Justices BOSE,

VIVIAN, AIYAR, N. CHANDRASEKHARA DAS, SUDHI RANJAN

JAGANNADHADAS, B. IMAM, SYED JAFFER) the court said,

After all, in our considering whether the defect is illegal or merely

irregular, we shall have to take into account several factors, such as the

form and the language of the mandatory provisions, the scheme and

the object to be achieved, the nature of the violation, etc. Dealing with

the question whether a provision in a statute is mandatory or directory,

Lord Penzance observed in Howard v. Bodington [1877] 2 P D. 203.

"There may be many provisions in Acts of Parliament which, although

they are not strictly obeyed, yet do not appear to the court to be of that

material importance to the subject-matter to which they refer, as that

the legislature could have intended that the non-observance of them

should be followed by a total failure of the whole proceedings. On the

other hand, there are some provisions in respect of which the court would

take an opposite view, and would feel that they are matters which must

be strictly obeyed, otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently

follow must come to an end". These words can be applied mutatis

mutandis to cases where there is no charge at all. The gravity of the

defect will have to be considered to determine if it falls within one class

or the other. Is it a mere unimportant mistake in procedure or is it

substantial and vital? The answer will depend largely on the facts and

circumstances of each case. If it is so grave that prejudice will necessarily

be implied or imported, it may be described as an illegality. If the

seriousness of the omission is of a lesser degree, it will be an

13 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

irregularity and prejudice by way of failure of justice will have to be

established.

In addition section 34(2) of Right to Information Act says,

(2) Until rules are made under Article 136 of the Constitution pertaining

to appeals under this section, the rules made under that Article

pertaining to an application by way of revision to the Court of Appeal,

shall apply in respect of every appeal made under subsection (1) of this

section.

If the procedure is that of revision, then it affects the substance too. As Justice

Dr. A. R. B. Amerasinghe said in FERNANDO v. SYBIL FERNANDO AND

OTHERS, 1997, 1997 - Volume 3 ,Page No 1,

It was no exaggeration for Sir Maurice Amos (A Day in Court at

Home and Abroad, (1926) Cambridge Law Journal 340) to claim that

"Procedure lies at the heart of the law". The Evershed Committee in its

final report on Supreme Court Practice and Procedure (1953) Cmd. 8878

para. I observed that "the shape and development of the substantive law

of England have always been, and, we think, always will be, strongly

influenced by matters of procedure." The Committee cited the celebrated

aphorism of Sir Henry Maine that" substantive law has at first the look

of being gradually secreted in the interstices of procedure."

As THOMAS O. MAIN5 wrote in his article THE PROCEDURAL FOUNDATION

OF SUBSTANTIVE LAW July 2009,

As Professor John Hart Ely observed, [w]e were all brought up on

sophisticated talk about the fluidity of the line between substance and

procedure. Some other characterizations of the state of the doctrine are

5 Associate Dean for Faculty Scholarship and Professor of Law, University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law. tmain@pacific.edu.

14 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

less forgiving. Professor Risinger has suggested that organized confusion

is the official doctrine. My personal favorite is counsel offered by Professor

Herbert Goodrich in his 1927 Handbook on the Conflict of Laws: [T]he

distinction is made by courts, and the lawyer must figure it out as best he

can. The line between substance and procedure is often described with

unflattering adjectives such as vague,unpredictable, imprecise,

amorphous, unresolvable, unclear, chameleon-like, murky,

blurry, hazy, and superbly fuzzy.

Therefore this is not only an appeal but also an application for revision. There is

no inordinate delay by the Bank which will prejudice the rights of citizen

Pasansani. Hence exercising not only the appellate power of this Court, but also

the revisionary powers of it, this Court will consider the merits of the appeal.

(C) The substantive objection of the Bank to release the information:

The main substantive objection of the Bank to comply with the order of the Right

to Information Commission is based on sections 5(1)(a) and 5(1)(l) of the Act

which read as follows,

5. (1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (2) a request under this Act

for access to information shall be refused, where

(a) the information relates to personal information the disclosure of

which has no relationship to any public activity or interest, or

which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the

individual unless the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of

such information or the person concerned has consented in writing to

such disclosure;

..

15 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

(l) disclosure of the information would harm the integrity of an

examination being conducted by the Department of Examination or a

Higher Educational Institution;

The Bank accepts, that, this objection was not taken before the commission, but

maintains that it could be taken up before this Court for the first time, as it is a

question of law. The written submissions on behalf of Pasansini too says, that,

this position was not taken up by the Bank before the commission. There is

nothing that prevents the Bank from taking up that position before this Court

for first time as it is a question of law.

Now, the following is what Pasansini requested,

(i) The mark sheets of applicants for the competitive examination published

on the Banks website on 13th November 2017,

(ii) The interview marks and the merit list of 11708 applicants who faced the

interview,

(iii) Marks at the examination and marks given on the order of merit to all

applicants from Galle District,

(iv) The list of applicants who have been recruited on district merit,

(v) The particulars of applicants within that district who failed to assume

duties although selected

(vi) The dates on which successors were selected for such vacancies and their

list

Section 5(1)(a) has several parts. They are,

(a) The information relates to personal information:

Does the above contain personal information? The answer is yes. The marks

obtained by each candidate is their personal information. But is it only

16 | C . A . R T I 0 5 2 0 2 1 J u d g m e n t J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 1 2 t h F e b r u a r y 2 0 2 4

personal information? If the merits list is a product, it uses the ingredient of

marks obtained by each and every candidate who sat the examination.

The next part is,

(b) The disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or interest:

Is it not in the interest of public, that, public examinations, upon the

results of which citizens are recruited to occupations on merit must be

honest, upright and transparent? The answer is yes.

For example, if we take (iii) above, Marks at the examination and marks given

on the order of merit to all applicants from Galle District, is something that

a concerned citizen has a right now recognized by the Constitution to know.

So although at least some information are personal, it cannot be said, that,

the disclosure of them has no relationship to any public activity or interest.

The next part is,

(c) Or which would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual:

When merit list prepared upon individual marks determine the answer to the

question who should be in and who should be out, can one say that the

invasion of the privacy is unwarranted? It appears, that, the answer should be

no.

But this must be analysed further. What is in (c) above is subject to the next part

that is in (d).

(d) Unless the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information:

The citizen concerned in this case is one of the public. She represents the

public and its larger interest.

The next part of the above section (e) or the person concerned has consented in

writing to such disclosure does not apply in this case.

(D) The larger question of balancing between the right to privacy and the

larger public interest:

The propositions in (c) and (d) above taken together refer to the larger question

of balancing between the right to privacy and the larger public interest.

The origin of the mid 18th century word Panopticon is from all + Greek

optikon, neuter of optikos optic. It means a circular prison with cells arranged

around a central well, from which prisoners could at all times be observed.

The idea is attributed to the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. But according to

Philip Schofield, professor of the History of Legal and Political Thought and the

Director of the Bentham Project at UCL (University College London), it was

originally the idea of Benthams brother Samuel who was working in Russia on

the estate in Kirchev. As he had a relatively unskilled workforce, he sat himself

in the middle of the factory and arranged his workforce in a circle around his

central desk so he could keep an eye on what everyone was doing. Bentham went

to visit his brother in 1780s and decided that the concept could be extended to

prisons, schools and hospitals.

Despite Bentham persuading the prime minister, William Pitt the Younger to

fund a panopticon National Penitentiary, it could not be accomplished during

Benthams life time.

The French philosopher Michel Foucault in his book Discipline and Punish

1975 revitalised the idea of the panopticon. He describes the prisoner of a

panopticon as being at the receiving end of asymmetrical surveillance:

He is seen, but he does not see; he is an object of information, never a

subject in communication6.

As a consequence, the inmate polices himself for fear of punishment.

According to Schofield The principle is central inspection. As there is Closed

Circuit Television (CCTV) the round building is no longer a must.

Hence the Right to Information Act brings the state into the receiving end of

asymmetrical surveillance and the citizens are placed in the central well of the

panopticon. The state is the unskilled workers in 1870 Russia and the citizen

is Benthams brother. The state now has to police itself for fear of punishment

which it faces on adverse public opinion.

But Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism and a leading advocate of the

separation of church and state, freedom of expression and individual right, did

not want the panopticon to be a tool of oppression. This led him to develop, later

in his life, a type of anti panopticon where a minister sits an exposed room

and surrounded by the members of the public who listen and ask questions7.

This is the opposite of the surveillance state of Michel Foucaults

Discipline and Punish. The roles have been exchanged. The observer has

become the observed. This is based on the simple propagation of light8, a law

in physics. As Benthams brother observed his workers, they could observe him.

This was not the case in every penitentiary built according to panopticon model9.

But an Act on Right to Information on this theory must make the state, the

government and the public bodies police themselves on the peril of being

exposed.

It is said,

Communities can play an active role in promoting good governance,

because public opinion provides some of the incentives needed to make

7 The philosopher Jeremy Bentham famously requested in his will that his body be dissected and put on public display. This came to pass, and his skeleton now sits in a glass case at University College London, adorned with a wax head, waistcoat and jacket and sat on a wooden stool, staring out at students from its glass case.

egotistical politicians serve our collective interest. The threat of being

discovered and exposed should, in principle, scare the corrupt or inept. In

his essay 'On Packing', Bentham argued that libel laws work against the

public interest because they prevent corruption being held up to public

view. These criticisms have particular resonance in Britain given the

exploitation of the country's famously tough libel laws to protect

commercial interests. Specialist media lawyers such as Carter-Ruck have

recently used super injunctions to stifle public criticism of their corporate

clients. The paperwork for these injunctions (proceedings for which often

take place in secret) are anonymous, so that no researcher going through

court records could ever learn of what happened10.

And also,

The idea is that this transparency holds power to account, because

the most dangerous people in society can be rulers. It is important

that they, as well as prisoners, workers and children, feel watched11.

The next sub section 5(1)(l) on which the Bank relies has the following element,

(f)disclosure of the information would harm the integrity of an examination

case in which it was said, that, marks obtained by successful candidates in

examinations conducted by government body constitutes a public document.

September, 2008 the High Court of Delhi comprising of Justice S. Muralidhar

and the Chief Justice (judgment authored by Muralidhar J.) said,

17. At the outset we wish to observe that a perusal of the documents

submitted by the UPSC in a sealed cover, are not of such a nature that

can be characterised as secret, or of a type the disclosure of which would

not be in public interest. As regards the scaling methodology, as already

been pointed out by the learned Single Judge, this is no different from

what already stands disclosed by the UPSC to the Supreme Court in its

counter affidavit filed in SLP (C) No. 23723 of 2002 and is therefore in the

public domain. As regards the apprehension expressed by the UPSC that

the scaling formulation could be deciphered first once the cut-off marks

and solution keys in respect of individual subject disclosed, we fail to

understand how if such information is deciphered in relation to the

examination that has already been conducted, somehow it would enable

the manipulation of the results of a preliminary examination to be held in

future.

18. The central thrust of the argument of Mr. Rao was that armed with the

information relating to the 2006 Preliminary Examination, coaching

institutes across the country would somehow able to anticipate the subjects

in which, if dummy candidates are fielded, there could be a skewing of the

results. According to him, the UPSC apprehends that in a particular

subject, by getting a large number of dummy candidates to perform badly,

the working of scaling methodology which is already known would result in

an unfair advantage to candidates opting for that paper. As a corollary it

would result in severe prejudice and an unintended disadvantage to a

meritorious students opting for other subjects.

19. This argument has only to be stated to be rejected. It is really impossible

to imagine how the coaching institutes can somehow anticipate the levels

of difficulty in a particular subject in a future examination and plant

dummy candidates in that subject or in other subjects. Considering that

400,000 students sit for the CSE preliminary examination all over the

country every year, this would perhaps require a large scale operation by

coaching institutes all over the country and that again presumes that they

will somehow correctly predict what the overall performance of the

candidates in any particular subject. Then again, this is only a preliminary

examination at the end of which a shortlist of candidates 10 to 12 times the

number of advertised posts is drawn up for the Main examination. It is

nobodys case that the results of the main examination are somehow

affected in that process. Further still, this Court is unable to understand

the apprehension of the UPSC that by disclosing the working of the scaling

methodology for the preliminary examination, merit can get compromised

and candidates with less merit would be selected. The whole purpose of

having three levels of examination i.e. preliminary examination, main

examination and then interview, is to ensure that only meritorious

candidates are selected for government service. We are of the view that the

apprehension expressed by the UPSC is not well-founded.

So even where it was argued for the Public Authority concerned that the

coaching institutions can get to know the mechanism of the process of

selection and plant dummy candidates to affect the quality of the merits

list adversely, the particulars of the examination containing individual

marks and merit list was considered to be a public document.

What the Delhi High Court said in the above case addresses the concern in

section 5(1)(l) which is, disclosure of the information would harm the integrity

of an examination being conducted by the Department of Examination or a

Higher Educational Institution.

As per paragraph 41 of the written submissions filed on behalf of Pasansini the

order made by the Right to Information Commission (relevant parts) is

reproduced. This Court observes, that, the Commission in its wisdom had

ordered a structured manner of disclosure of information.

In the circumstances, the objection by the Bank to release the information

ordered to be released have no merit and the appeal (which also could be

considered an application for revision) is dismissed.

There is no order on costs.
