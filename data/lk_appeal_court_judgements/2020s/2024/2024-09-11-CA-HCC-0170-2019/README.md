Sampath B. Abayakoon, J.

This is an appeal preferred by the accused-appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the appellant) on the basis of being aggrieved of his conviction and the sentence

by the learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

The appellant was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for trafficking 4.03

grams of Diacetylmorphine, a dangerous drug commonly known as Heroin, on

11-08-2013 at Dam Street within the jurisdiction of the High Court of Colombo,

and thereby committing an offence punishable in terms of Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by the Amendment Act No. 13 of 1984.

He was also indicted for having in his possession the above-mentioned quantity

of Diacetylmorphine at the same time and at the same transaction, and thereby

committing an offence punishable as above.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge of Colombo of the judgment dated 17-

06-2019 found the appellant guilty as charged, and after having considered the

mitigatory as well as aggravating circumstances, sentenced the appellant for life

imprisonment.

The Facts in Brief

PW-01, an officer attached to Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) has been informed

by one of his subordinates (PW-02) on 11-08-2013 at 12.50 hours that he

received an information from one of his private informants about trafficking of

Heroin.

The information had been to the effect that one Keselwatta Dinuka, who is a

Heroin trafficker operating from Dubai, distributes Heroin through one Vimukthi

living in Madaawi Flats, Keselwatta and he does it through a person called

Mahaththaya.

After the information, PW-01 has organized a raid and has left the PNB at 13.40

hours with a team of police officers including PW-02. They have reached the old

fish market situated on Reclamation Road around 14.00 hours and has stopped

their vehicle at the old car park of the fish market. The private informant has

come and met them and had informed further that the person called

Mahaththaya would be coming near Hasthagiri Hotel situated on Dam Street

around 5.30 and 6.00 in the evening to hand over a Heroin parcel to another.

Having received this information, the police team had waited, expecting further

communication. They have been informed at 17.10 hours by the informant as to

the place where he would be stationed so that he can show the person called

Mahaththaya to them. After a while, the informant has signaled to a person

coming towards them, which has resulted in PW-01 and his team stopping him

in front of Hasthagiri Hotel and searching him. It has been his evidence that the

person attempted to escape, which resulted him being handcuffed. PW-01 has

recovered a parcel concealed in his undergarment as a result of the search, and

through his experience, has observed that the contents in the parcel was Heroin.

Accordingly, the person has been arrested after informing him of the charge

against him. Both PW-01 and 02 had identified the person they came to know

as Mahaththaya as the appellant at the trial before the High Court.

Page 4 of 15

After the arrest, the police team had gone to Mahara area where the appellant

was residing and had searched a room, and had then returned to Keselwatta and

searched a flat situated in Madaawi Flats where the appellants parents, sister

and some small children were living. The search of the houses has not resulted

in finding anything illegal. Thereafter, the appellant has been taken to the PNB

and after testing and confirming that the powder found was Heroin, PW-01 has

taken the other procedural steps to seal the productions and hand over the same

to the relevant Production Officer.

The evidence of PW-02, who has given evidence to corroborate PW-01, has been

the same.

At the cross-examination of PW-01 as well as PW-02, the position taken up by

the appellant had been that he was arrested while walking in Dam Street in order

to go to his employers house to handover the days collection of the shop situated

in the Manning Market where he was employed. It has been alleged that he was

assaulted, and his sister and little daughter who came there after hearing about

his arrest was also taken into custody along with another person, and later

released. It had been the position of the appellant that the police officers could

not find anything illegal from his possession, but later introduced Heroin to him

and falsely accused him of having Heroin in his possession.

The prosecution has also led the evidence to establish the chain of custody and

since the Government Analyst Report has been admitted in terms of section 420

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, the Government Analyst has not been

called as a witness.

When the appellant was called upon for a defence at the conclusion of the

prosecution case, he has made a lengthy dock statement. He has stated that on

the day of his arrest, he went to meet his employer to give him Rs. 12,800/-

which was the days collection of the shop situated in Manning Market where he

was employed. He has claimed that police officers stopped him while he was

walking on Dam Street and searched him, but could not find anything illegal in

Page 5 of 15

his possession. He has claimed that he was assaulted at that point, and when

his sister and young daughter came and intervened, all of them were arrested

and taken in a police jeep. He has also claimed that he was blindfolded at that

time, severely assaulted, and another person was also taken into police custody

while he was taken in the jeep.

He has admitted that the police officers searched his boarding place in Mahara

and the house where his parents lived. He has stated that he was made to sign

several documents at the PNB and later produced before the Magistrates Court

for allegedly possessing Heroin. He has claimed that the Heroin was introduced

to him and he is innocent of committing any crime.

On behalf of the appellant, his sister and the daughter whom the appellant

claimed to have come when he was arrested, has also given evidence.

The sisters evidence had been to the effect that while at home, she came to know

about her brother being assaulted in Dam Street, which was a short distance

away from their home, and she and the daughter of the appellant who was with

her went in a three-wheeler to inquire. She has seen her brother being assaulted,

and when attempted to intervene, she was addressed in filth by those who

assaulted her brother, she has come to know that they were police officers. She

has also stated that the police team searched her house. She has denied that

her brother had any Heroin in his possession. She has been subjected to lengthy

cross-examination on behalf of the prosecution.

The daughter mentioned earlier has also been called on behalf of the appellant

to give evidence for his defence. When giving evidence before the High Court, she

was an 11-year-old child and had been a 6-year-old when this incident occurred.

After leading her evidence up to an extent, the learned Counsel who appeared

for the appellant had informed the Court that he will no longer lead evidence of

her. She has also been subjected to cross-examination by the prosecution.

It appears from the proceedings before the High Court that the learned High

Court Judge has questioned the defence witnesses while they gave evidence. It

Page 6 of 15

needs to be observed that when the daughter of the appellant was called upon

to give evidence and when the learned Counsel for the appellant led her evidence,

it was the learned High Court Judge who has asked more questions from her

than the learned Counsel for the appellant who commenced leading her evidence

in chief. This appears to be the reason why the learned Counsel has informed

the Court that he will no longer call the daughter of the appellant as a witness.

It needs to be observed further that the learned High Court Judge has put several

questions to her at the cross-examination as well.

Pronouncing his judgment on 17-06-2019, the learned High Court Judge after

having analyzed the evidence placed before him has rejected the defence put

forward by the appellant on the basis that it has no merit and is improbable. On

the basis that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, the

appellant has been convicted for both the counts preferred against him and

sentenced accordingly.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Counsel for the appellant formulated

the following grounds of appeal for consideration of the Court.

1. That the learned High Court Judge has acted contrary to the provisions

of section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance as he has encroached into the

role of the prosecutor and thereby denied a fair trial to the appellant.

2. That the learned High Court Judge has not given a fair opportunity to

the appellant to present the defence case.

3. That the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider whether the

defence version passes the test of probability rather than that of the

prosecution, and the dock statement of the appellant has not been

considered properly.

The learned Counsel for the appellant made submissions mainly referring to the

manner in which the learned High Court Judge questioned the defence witnesses

to argue that it has denied a fair trial towards the appellant. The learned Counsel

Page 7 of 15

for the appellant was of the view that an accused person when called upon for a

defence is entitled to place his defence before the trial Court without hindrance.

He was of the view that the learned High Court Judge has failed to give him a

fair trial due to the excessive questioning of the prosecution witnesses.

He pointed out towards the evidence of the daughter of the appellant who has

been called as a witness for the defence. It was his view that the learned High

Court Judge has prejudged her evidence on the basis that she was lying from

the very outset of her evidence, and had excessively questioned the witness even

before she could conclude her evidence in chief by putting questions the

prosecution Counsel should have put while the witness was being subjected to

cross-examination. He was of the view that this was the very reason why the

learned Counsel who represented the appellant at the trial has given up on

leading the evidence of the daughter of the appellant.

He also pointed out that the learned High Court Judge has used the knowledge

he gained from the other witness called for the defence, namely the sister of the

appellant, to confront the daughter of the appellant and had used it to make

adverse references as to the evidence of the defence witnesses in a manner that

has caused great prejudice to the appellant.

It was the submission of the learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General (SDSG) that

the prosecution has led cogent and truthful evidence to prove the charges against

the appellant, and was of the view that the learned High Court Judge has

analyzed the evidence in its correct perspective. The learned SDSG justified the

learned High Court Judges view that the defence put forward by the appellant

was a built up defence. However, the learned SDSG also conceded that the way

the learned High Court Judge questioned the defence witnesses might have

exceeded the powers vested in a High Court Judge to put questions to witnesses

in terms of section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Page 8 of 15

He was also of the view that the defence put forward by the appellant was a

defence that cannot be believed; therefore, no prejudice has been caused to the

appellant because of the earlier mentioned excessive questioning.

Consideration of the Grounds of Appeal

As the learned Counsel for the appellant argued this matter on the basis that

the appellant was denied of a fair trial and the learned High Court Judge had

been biased towards the prosecution throughout the trial, I will now proceed to

consider the three grounds of appeal together as they are interrelated.

Having listened to the submissions of the learned Counsel for the appellant and

that of the learned SDSG, it is the view of the Court that the question that should

be decided in this appeal is whether the manner in which the defence witnesses,

especially the daughter of the appellant, was questioned by the learned High

Court Judge has caused a prejudice towards him and thereby, he has been

denied of a fair trial guaranteed to him under the provisions of the Constitution.

The Article 13(3) of the Constitution reads as follows.

13(3) Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard

in person or by an Attorney-at-law, at a fair trial by a competent

Court.

The relevant section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance, the learned High Court

Judge may have used to question the defence witness reads as follows.

165. The Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of

relevant facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time,

of any witness, or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant;

and may order the production of any document or thing; and neither

the parties nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection

to any such question or order, nor, without the leave of the Court, to

cross-examine any witness upon any answer given in reply to any

such question:

Page 9 of 15

Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this

Ordinance to be relevant and duly proved:

Provided also that this section shall not authorize any Judge to

compel any witness to answer any question, or to produce any

document, which such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer

or produce under sections 121 or 131 both inclusive, if the question

were asked or the document were called for by the adverse party; nor

shall the Judge ask any question which it would be improper for any

other person to ask under section 148 or 149; nor shall he dispense

with primary evidence of any document, expecting the cases

hereinbefore excepted.

The provisions of section 165 are clear that a trial Judge has been given a wide

option to examine and put questions to any witness called upon either by the

prosecution or by the defence. However, it is the view of this Court that, that

right is not an unfettered right in view of the provisos to the section as the

expected purpose of section 165 is to allow a trial Judge to ascertain the truth

of a relevant fact or facts.

In the case of State of Rajasthan Vs. Ani, AIR 1997 SC 1023, 1025: 1197

CriLJ 1529, it was observed,

Criminal trial should not turn out to be about or combat between two rival

sides with the Judge performing the role only of a spectator or even an

umpire to pronounce finally who won the race. A Judge is expected to

actively participate in the trial, elicit necessary materials from the witnesses

at the appropriate context which he feels necessary for reaching the correct

conclusion. There is nothing which inhibits his power to put questions to the

witnesses, either during chief examination or cross-examination or even

during re-examination to elicit truth. The corollary of it is if a Judge felt that

a witness has committed an error or a slip it is the duty of the Judge to

ascertain whether it was so, for, to err is human and the chance of erring

Page 10 of 15

may accelerate under stress of nervousness during cross-examination.

Criminal justice is not to be founded on erroneous answers spelt out by

witnesses during evidence collecting process. It is a useful exercise for trial

Judge to remain active and alert so errors can be minimized.

In this context, I would also like to quote from the observation of Chinnappa

Reddy, J. in Ram Chander Vs. The State of Haryana (AIR 1981 SC 1036).

The adversary system of trial being what it is there is an unfortunate

tendency for a Judge presiding over a trial to assume a role of a referee or

an umpire and to allow the trial to develop into a contest between the

prosecution and the defence with the defence distortions flowing from

combative and competitive elements entering the trial procedure. If a

criminal Court is to be an effective instrument in dispensing justice, the

Presiding Judge must cease to be a spectator and a mere recoding machine.

He must become a participant in the trial by evincing intelligent, active

interest by putting questions to witnesses in order to ascertain the truth.

In view of the above judgments and the constant view held by our Superior

Courts, it is clear that although our system of justice is adversarial as opposed

to inquisitorial, still a Judge can get involved in a case to ascertain the truth so

that he can dispense justice fairly and equally. However, it must be emphasized

that while doing so, a Judge must also make sure not to exceed the expected

parameters in that regard so that any line of questioning should not be seen or

can be interpreted as being biased or prejudicial towards the rights of the parties

to have a fair trial, may it be for the prosecution or the defence.

In this relation, I would like to cite the case of Sisilinona Vs. Balasuriya (2002)

1 SLR 404, which I find relevant in terms of section 165 of the Evidence

Ordinance as well, although this was a matter where provisions of the Civil

Procedure Code were considered,.

Held,

Page 11 of 15

1. Section 164 of the Civil Procedure Code provides that the Court may

question a witness at any time and by section 165 a Judge is vested with

a power to put questions to a witness in order to discover or to obtain

proper proof of relevant facts.

2. The Court must not question the witnesses in the spirit of beating him

down or encouraging him to give an answer.

Per Somawansa, J.,

One must not forget the fact that even witnesses who are able to stand

their ground in the face of the severest cross-examination at the hands

of the opposing counsel are in view of the difference with which they treat

the Court incline to treat with greatest regard suggestions when they

come from Court and are couched in compelling language and it is a rare

witness who still steadily maintain his version in the face of such

questioning by Court.

In the case of the Queen Vs. V.P. David Perera 66 NLR 553, it was held,

A Judge is not entitled to put leading questions, the answers to which are

calculated to prejudice the accused. Further, he must not ask questions in

such manner or such great number as to encroach upon the functions of a

counsel who appears in the case.

Basnayake, C.J. cited the English case of Yuill Vs. Yuill (1945) 1 All E.R. 183

where it was stated by Greene, M.R.:

It is quite plain to me that the Judge was endeavoring to ascertain the truth

in the manner which at the moment seem to him most convenient. But he

must, I think, have lost sight of the inconveniences which are apt to flow

from an undue participation by the Judge in the examination of witnesses.

It is of course always proper for a Judge and it is his duty to put questions

with a view to elucidating and obscure answer or when he thinks that the

witness has misunderstood a question put to him by counsel. If there are

Page 12 of 15

matters which the Judge considers have not been sufficiently cleared up or

questions which he himself thinks ought to have been put, he can, of course

take steps to see that deficiency is made good. It is, I think, generally more

convenient to do this when the counsel has finished his questions or is

passing to a new subject. It must always be borne in mind that a Judge

does not know what is in counsels brief and has not the same facilities as

counsel for an effective examination in chief or cross-examination.

In the case of Jones Vs. National Coal Board (1957) 2 WLR 760, Denning, L.J.

endorsing what Greene M.R. had said in Yuills case and added,

The Judges part in all this is to hearken to the evidence, only himself

asking questions of witnesses when it is necessary to clear up any point

that has been overlooked or left obscure; to see that the advocates behave

themselves seemingly and keep to the rules laid down by law; to exclude

irrelevancies and discourage repetitions, to make sure by wise intervention

that he follows the points that the advocates are making and can assess

their worth; and at the end to make up his mind where the truth lies. If he

goes beyond this, he drops the mantle of a Judge and assumes the role of

an advocate; and the change does not become him well.

The above judicial pronouncements clearly establish the fact that although a

trial Judge is entitled to put questions to a witness, it should be with the view of

ascertaining the truth and clarifying the relevant facts. It is my considered view

that a trial Judge should be careful not to show that he has crossed the line and

gone beyond the rights conferred upon him in terms of section 165 of the

Evidence Ordinance. In such a scenario, the questioning of a trial Judge can be

interpreted as fulfilling the role of a prosecutor, which amounts to a denial of a

fair trial to an accused person.

In the appeal under consideration, the main contention of the learned Counsel

for the appellant was that the appellant was not afforded a fair trial because of

the way the learned High Court Judge put questions to the defence witnesses,

Page 13 of 15

especially for the daughter of the appellant, who gave evidence on behalf of him.

She has been an 11-year-old child at the time she gave evidence. It is quite

apparent from the evidence that from the very outset of leading her evidence by

the learned Counsel for the appellant, the learned High Court Judge has

intervened and put his own questions, which should have been put by the

prosecuting State Counsel when the witness was subjected to cross-

examination. It is quite apparent that the learned High Court Judge was of the

view from the very outset of her evidence that she is saying something taught to

her by someone else. He has questioned the witness to the effect that who told

you to come and narrate this story before the Court, and when she said no one

did, the learned High Court Judge has put several questions to confront her. It

appears that when the learned Counsel for the appellant attempted to lead

further evidence, the learned High Court Judge has again intervened by putting

questions based on the knowledge he gained when the sister of the appellant

gave evidence previously.

In this process, based on his questioning, the learned High Court Judge has

made several observations as to the demeanour and deportment of this child

witness.

It is clear that as a result of this excessive questioning by the learned High Court

Judge, the learned Counsel who represented the appellant may have thought

that there would be no purpose for him to lead evidence anymore. This has

prompted the learned Counsel to inform the learned High Court Judge that he

will no longer lead evidence of the daughter of the appellant. It appears that, the

said statement has also been found fault by the learned High Court Judge.

When the witness was allowed to be cross-examined, it clearly appears that the

learned High Court Judge has again put several questions, which appears to be

filling the gaps in the line of cross-examination by the learned State Counsel.

Page 14 of 15

It is with regret I need to observe that, this gives the appearance no fair trial has

been granted to the appellant, which would have a vitiating effect on the final

judgment pronounced after a full trial.

It is the view of this Court that it is not only important to hold a fair trial, but it

must be manifestly seen that a fair trial was afforded to an accused person.

In the case of SC (SPL) LA 184/2017 decided on 26.06.2020

Per Aluwihare, P.C., J.,

Lord Chief Justice Hewarts remarks in the case R v. Sussex Justices, ex

parte McCarthy ([1924] 1 KB 256, [1923] All ER Rep 233) made almost 100

years ago, Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and

undoubtedly be seen to be done are now heard throughout the common law

legal regimes. They sustain, in my view, not only an ethical requirement that

judges cannot hear a case if, from the perspective of a reasonable and

informed observer, their impartiality might reasonably appear to be

compromised, but transcends to the requirement that judges must also

observe procedures that are widely regarded as fair and transparent,

especially in criminal cases.

It was observed in the case of The King V. Namasivayam Et Al. Appeals Nos.

21-24 of 1948 49 NLR 289,

While it cannot be doubted that a Judge has very wide powers of asking

any question he pleases in any form and at any time of any witness, we feel

that those powers should not be so used as to afford ground for the

legitimate criticism that the accused persons have not had the benefit of a

trial which can be regarded as entirely fair

For the reasons as set out above, I am of the view that this is a judgment that

cannot be allowed to stand. Accordingly, I set aside the conviction and the

sentence dated 17-06-2019 of the appellant by the learned High Court Judge.

Page 15 of 15

The next matter that needs to be considered is whether this is a fit and proper

case to be sent for a re-trial. This is an incident that was alleged to have occurred

on 11-08-2013, some 11 years ago. After trial, the judgment has been

pronounced in the year 2019. Since this conviction, the appellant had been in

incarceration for over 5 years.

As this is an action which was instituted based on a raid conducted by trained

police officers who have access to their notes made in that regard, recalling of

such witnesses has to be considered under that context. Such witnesses will be

able to be more perfect in order to cover any lapses that may have been made in

the first trial. Hence, I am of the view that this is not a case fit to be sent for a

re-trial.

Accordingly, I acquit the accused-appellant from the charges preferred against

him.
