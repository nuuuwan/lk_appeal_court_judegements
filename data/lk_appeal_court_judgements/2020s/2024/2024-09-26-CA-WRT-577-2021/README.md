RESPONDENTS Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. Counsel: Nilshantha Sirimanna with Deshara Goonetilleke and Amaya Fernando for the Petitioners. Arjuna Kurukulasuriya for the 01st, 02nd and 03rd Respondents. Chaya Sri Nammuni, D.S.G. with Pulina Jayasuriya, S.C. for the 03"" and 04th Respondents. Argued on : 17.07.2024 Written Submissions on : 30.08.2024 (by Petitioners) Decided on : 26.09.2024 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

It is noted at the outset that the present judgment shall also apply, mutatis

mutandis, to CA (Writ) Application Nos. 597/21 and 607/21, as the issues

raised and the legal questions presented therein are identical to those

adjudicated upon in this matter. Accordingly, this judgment is to be treated

as common to all three cases.

The Petitioners have instituted this action challenging the legality of Circular

No. 01/2021, issued by and under the authority of the Respondents, namely

the Engineering Council of Sri Lanka (ECSL). Their petition primarily rests on

the assertion that the ECSL has exceeded its statutory mandate as outlined

8

in the Engineering Council, Sri Lanka Act No. 4 of 2017. The Petitioners are

seeking writs of Certiorari to quash Circular No. 01/2021 and writs of

Prohibition to restrain the ECSL from enforcing its unlawful provisions, which

they argue overstep the ECSLs statutory mandate and violate their rights as

professionals.

Petitioners Contention

The Petitioners argue that the ECSLs issuance of Circular No. 01/2021 is

ultra vires, beyond its legal authority. They contend that the Engineering

Council Act clearly defines the categories of engineering practitioners subject

to regulation under the Act, namely Chartered Engineers, Associate

Engineers, Affiliate Engineers, Incorporated Engineers, Engineering

Diplomates, and Engineering Technicians (marked 'P-5'). The Petitioners

allege that the Circular unlawfully mandates registration for all engineers,

regardless of whether they fall within the specific categories outlined by the

Act. This broad imposition of mandatory registration exceeds the ECSLs

powers, as the Act does not contemplate the inclusion of other engineering

professionals, such as those holding foreign qualifications or practical

experience in specialized fields like Marine Engineering, Automotive

Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering (marked 'P-6').

The Petitioners submit that, prior to the enactment of the Engineering Council

Act in 2017, the engineering profession in Sri Lanka was largely unregulated,

with engineers practicing based on internationally recognized standards. They

argue that the Circular, by imposing a mandatory registration requirement

and penal consequences for non-compliance, represents a drastic and

unexpected shift in the professional landscape (marked 'P-6'). The Petitioners

assert that they had a legitimate expectation that the profession would not be

subjected to such abrupt and far-reaching changes without proper

consultation or statutory justification. They further contend that this shift

violates their reliance on the long-standing regulatory framework, which

allowed for greater professional autonomy (marked 'P-6').

9

The Petitioners further contend that the Circular is discriminatory and creates

an unfair monopoly in favour of engineers registered with the Institute of

Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL) and the Institution of Incorporated Engineers, Sri

Lanka (IIESL).

The Petitioners also challenge the procedural validity of the Circular, arguing

that the ECSL failed to comply with the procedural requirements outlined in

the Engineering Council Act. Specifically, Section 39 of the Act mandates that

any rules made by the ECSL must be published in the Government Gazette

(marked 'P-5'). The Petitioners contend that the Circular, despite carrying the

force of law, was not subjected to the statutory rule-making process, thereby

violating principles of procedural fairness and transparency.

Respondents Contention

The Respondents, in principle, deny the allegations of the ultra vires action

and contend that Circular No. 01/2021 falls fully within the statutory powers

granted to the ECSL under the Engineering Council, Sri Lanka Act No. 4 of

2017.

The Respondents further assert that the matter falls within the ambit of

Article 126(3) of the Constitution, which confers jurisdiction upon the

Supreme Court to adjudicate fundamental rights violations. They argue that

the Petitioners claims, even if valid, should be addressed through

fundamental rights litigation rather than by invoking the writ jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal. Additionally, the Respondents contend that the

Petitioners' application is time-barred under the relevant constitutional

provisions governing such claims.

The Respondents assert that Circular No. 01/2021 was issued pursuant to

the ECSLs statutory authority under Sections 12, 13, and 39 of the Act.

Section 12 of the Act authorizes the ECSL to make representations to the

Government and other relevant bodies on matters related to the practice of

the engineering profession. The Respondents argue that the Circular falls

10

squarely within this mandate, as it aims to regulate the professional

standards and conduct of engineers in Sri Lanka. They further contend that

Section 13(e) of the Act empowers the ECSL to determine the terms and

conditions of regulation for engineering practitioners, while Section 39 allows

the ECSL to promulgate rules related to the registration and qualifications of

practitioners. In issuing Circular No. 01/2021, the Respondents argue that

the ECSL has merely exercised these powers to ensure that engineers meet

the requisite standards of competence and professionalism.

The Respondents assert that the purpose of the Circular is to establish a

uniform system of registration and professional recognition for all engineers

in Sri Lanka, in line with international standards. They argue that the

regulation of engineering practitioners is essential for safeguarding the public

interest, ensuring professional integrity, and aligning Sri Lankan engineering

standards with international accords, such as the Washington, Sydney, and

Dublin Accords (marked 'R2'). The Respondents emphasize that by

introducing a mandatory registration system, the ECSL is helping to raise the

standards of engineering practice in Sri Lanka and ensuring that all

practitioners are properly qualified and competent (marked 'R2').

The Respondents deny the Petitioners allegations of discrimination and

favouritism. They argue that the Circular applies uniformly to all engineering

professionals, regardless of their background or qualifications (marked 'R6').

The Respondents further state that the IESL and IIESL are recognized as

professional bodies by law, and the Circular merely implements the statutory

requirement that all engineering practitioners, including those affiliated with

these institutions, must meet certain professional standards (marked 'R5').

They argue that the registration requirement is designed to create a more

organized and professionally recognized engineering sector and is not

intended to unfairly benefit members of any specific institution (marked 'R6').

11

The Respondents assert that the Circular is consistent with the legislative

intent of the Act, which was to create a central regulatory body to oversee the

engineering profession and ensure compliance with international standards.

Observations of the Court

The Petitioners, who represent a broad spectrum of trade unions and

engineering professionals, seek judicial review of Circular No. 01/2021,

issued by the 1st Respondent, the Engineering Council of Sri Lanka (ECSL),

and its Chairman, the 2nd Respondent. This Circular mandates registration

of all engineers, regardless of their qualifications, with the ECSL and

introduces penal consequences for non-compliance. The Petitioners assert

that the Circular is ultra vires, arbitrary, discriminatory, and issued with

mala fides, in contravention of their legitimate expectations. Upon a thorough

examination of the submissions and the law, this court has observed that this

matter undoubted warrants judicial intervention.

Statutory Overreach and Ultra Vires Action by the ECSL

The Petitioners' principal argument is grounded in the doctrine of ultra vires,

alleging that the ECSL, in issuing Circular No. 01/2021, exceeded its

statutory powers as prescribed under the Engineering Council, Sri Lanka Act

No. 4 of 2017 (hereinafter referred to as the Act). The Act strictly confines

the ECSLs regulatory mandate to six specified categories of "engineering

practitioners," as enumerated in Section 41 and Schedule A of the Act,

namely: Chartered Engineers, Associate Engineers, Affiliate Engineers,

Incorporated Engineers, Engineering Diplomates, and Engineering

Technicians (marked 'P-5').

The Petitioners highlight that the Circular seeks to impose registration on all

persons engaging in engineering, irrespective of whether they fall within the

specified categories of "engineering practitioners" recognized by law. This,

they argue, represents a gross statutory overreach. The Petitioners contend

that Section 14 of the Act mandates only those professionals classified under

the six categories to register with the ECSL. The Act does not envisage a

12

scenario where engineers who do not meet these criteria, including those

holding foreign qualifications or working in specialized fields such as Marine

Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, and other non-IESL/IIESL-recognized

fields, would be subject to mandatory registration (marked 'P-6').

The strength of this argument is compelling as it relies on the express and

unambiguous language of the statute. A close reading of the Act reveals no

provision that permits the ECSL to extend its regulatory scope beyond the

specific classes of professionals mentioned therein. The rule-making power

conferred upon the ECSL under Section 39 of the Act is similarly limited to

making rules concerning registration procedures, standards of practice, and

maintaining the professional conduct of those already falling under the

defined categories. The ECSLs attempt to regulate professionals outside this

scope constitutes an unlawful exercise of power, and thus, the issuance of

the Circular is clearly ultra vires.

Violation of the Petitioners' Legitimate Expectations

The doctrine of legitimate expectation is a cornerstone of administrative law,

safeguarding individuals from arbitrary state action, especially where long-

standing practices have engendered reliance. The Petitioners argue that prior

to the enactment of the Act in 2017, the engineering profession in Sri Lanka

was largely self-regulated, with engineers engaging in their respective fields

based on internationally recognized standards and practices. Engineers were

not required to register with any central body, and many professionals relied

on this autonomy when building their careers (marked 'P-6').

The Circular, by mandating registration and criminalizing non-compliance,

represents a significant shift in the regulatory landscape. The Petitioners

assert that they had a legitimate expectation that any such drastic regulatory

changes would not be introduced without adequate consultation and legal

basis. Furthermore, the expectation that professionals would not be required

to register with a central body unless explicitly mandated by law was

reasonable and legitimate, given the absence of any prior regulatory

13

framework requiring such registration for a vast majority of engineers (marked

'P-6').

In this case, the Petitioners legitimate expectation was that their professional

status and rights would not be unilaterally altered, particularly in a manner

that could jeopardize their careers and livelihoods. The abrupt imposition of

mandatory registration, combined with penal provisions for non-compliance,

constitutes a violation of this expectation. The ECSL, in acting without proper

statutory authority, failed to give due regard to the legitimate reliance

interests of the Petitioners, thereby violating principles of fairness in

administrative action.

Discrimination and Arbitrary Favouritism

Another aspect of the Petitioners argument focuses on the discriminatory and

arbitrary nature of the Circular. They contend that the ECSL, through the

Circular, has introduced a regulatory regime that disproportionately favours

members of the Institute of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL) and the Institution of

Incorporated Engineers, Sri Lanka (IIESL). The Petitioners emphasize that a

majority of the ECSLs members are drawn from these two professional

bodies, creating an inherent bias in favour of engineers who possess

qualifications recognized by these institutions. Consequently, the Circular

seeks to compel all engineers, including those with foreign qualifications or

specialized knowledge in fields not recognized by IESL or IIESL, to conform to

the ECSLs registration requirements (marked 'P-6').

This effectively creates an exclusionary regime where professionals who are

not affiliated with IESL or IIESL are marginalized, unable to register, and

consequently, ineligible for employment or promotions within both the public

and private sectors. The Petitioners submit that the Circulars requirement

for mandatory registration, without accounting for the diversity of

qualifications held by engineers, is not only discriminatory but also creates

an artificial monopoly within the profession. The result is that only a narrow

group of engineers, those affiliated with IESL and IIESL, benefit from the

14

regulatory scheme, while others are unlawfully excluded (marked 'P-7 (a) to

(f)').

This argument is particularly persuasive as it highlights the risk of regulatory

capture, where a regulatory body like the ECSL, composed of representatives

from certain professional groups, enacts rules that unduly benefit its

members while excluding others. The Petitioners claim of arbitrary

favouritism is supported by the composition of the ECSL and the

disproportionate advantages conferred upon those who are members of IESL

and IIESL, thereby contravening the fundamental principles enshrined in our

legal system.

Failure to Follow Procedural Requirements and Absence of Proper Rule-

Making

It is also observed that the ECSL, in issuing the Circular, failed to comply with

the procedural requirements prescribed by the Act. Specifically, Section 39 of

the Act mandates that any rules made by the ECSL must be published in the

Government Gazette, thereby ensuring transparency and public participation

in the regulatory process. The Petitioners contend that the ECSL bypassed

this requirement, opting instead to issue a Circular that carries the force of

law without adhering to the statutory rule-making process (marked 'P-6').

The ECSLs failure to follow the proper procedure is a serious flaw, as it

deprives affected parties of the opportunity to challenge or provide input on

the rules being promulgated. Furthermore, the absence of a properly defined

hierarchy among engineering practitioners - one that accounts for both

academic qualifications and practical experience - creates confusion and

uncertainty within the profession. It is argued that any attempt to regulate

engineers without first establishing such a hierarchy is both arbitrary and

irrational. This argument underscores the ECSLs lack of preparedness and

its failure to establish a coherent regulatory framework before issuing far-

reaching directives through the Circular.

15

This court is of the view that the Respondents failed to address a key issue

raised by the Petitioners: the ECSLs mandate is expressly limited to six

specific categories of engineering practitioners. The Act does not provide the

ECSL with blanket authority to regulate all engineers or impose registration

requirements on professionals who do not fall within the defined categories.

Furthermore, while the ECSL has a legitimate interest in maintaining

professional standards, it must do so within the bounds of the law. The ECSL

cannot use its regulatory powers to extend its authority beyond what is clearly

prescribed by the statute.

It is also noted that contrary to the view submitted by the Respondents, the

Petitioners have demonstrated that the ECSLs composition and the nature of

the Circular disproportionately favour members of two institutions. The

failure to recognize foreign qualifications or practical experience gained

outside the IESL/IIESL framework creates an exclusionary system that

unfairly prejudices many professionals. This discrimination cannot be

justified by general claims of maintaining standards, particularly when the

regulatory framework is clearly biased in favour of a select group of engineers.

Conclusion

Upon considering the submissions and legal principles, the Petitioners have

established a clear and compelling case for the relief sought. The ECSLs

issuance of Circular No. 01/2021 is ultra vires and exceeds the scope of its

statutory mandate as prescribed under the Engineering Council, Sri Lanka

Act. The Circular unlawfully expands the ECSLs regulatory power to include

professionals who are not classified as "engineering practitioners" under the

Act, thereby infringing upon the rights of a vast majority of engineers in Sri

Lanka. Furthermore, the Petitioners have convincingly argued that the

Circular violates their legitimate expectations and imposes an unjust and

discriminatory regulatory regime that disproportionately favours members of

the IESL and IIESL. The ECSLs failure to follow proper rule-making

procedures, as mandated by the Act, further undermines the validity of the

Circular.

16

It is to be noted in this context that, the court of law will always strive to

restore fairness, prevent undue harm to any professional body, and ensure

that the state authorities/bodies act within the scope of their lawful authority.

In light of the foregoing, this Court finds that the conduct of the Respondents

is palpably wrong and legally unsustainable. The Petitioners have established

a clear entitlement to the relief sought. Accordingly, reliefs sought for in

prayers (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k), (l) and (m) are granted quashing

Circular No. 01/2021, along with any effects or consequences arising from its

issuance.

Cost of Rs. 50,000/- is imposed on the 2nd Respondent payable from his

personal funds.

Application allowed.
