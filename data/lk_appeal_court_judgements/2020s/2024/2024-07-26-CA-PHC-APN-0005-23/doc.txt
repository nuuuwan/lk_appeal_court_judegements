As the Appellant absconded the court in this case, after an inquiry this case

was fixed in absentia of him under Section 241 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and a warrant was issued against him.

On 14.09.2011 the 2nd and 4th Accused pleaded guilty to the charges and the

Learned High Court Judge found them guilty of charges 1-9 in the

indictment. After hearing the mitigation of 2nd and 4th Accused, the Learned

High Court Judge imposed a sentence of 5 years rigorous imprisonment

CA/PHC/APN 0005/23

6 | P a g e

separately on count 01-09 and further, ordered the sentences to run

concurrent to each other.

The trial proceeded against the Petitioner in absentia and the Learned High

Court Judge found the Petitioner guilty of counts 1st,3rd,6th,8th, and 9th. The

Petitioner was acquitted on counts 2nd,5th, and 7th. The Petitioner was

sentenced to 15 years rigorous imprisonment on each count on 13.03.2012

and the sentences were ordered to run concurrent to each other.

The Petitioner was arrested on an open warrant on 22.07.2019 and produced

before the High Court of Embilipitiya. An inquiry was held under Section

241(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979. At the end of

the inquiry the learned High Court Judge had rejected the application in

terms of 241(3) of the CPC and affirmed the judgment and sentence imposed

on 13.03.2012.

From the date of order dated 12.07.2021 the Petitioner has been serving the

sentence and presently he is sick and partially paralysed and his eyesight

also affected due his incarceration.

The Petitioner submits following exceptional circumstances amongst other

question of law that may be urged by the Counsel at the hearing of this

application.

a) The judgment of the Learned High Court Judge dated 13.03.2021

is contrary to law.

b) The Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the severity of the

death threats and neglected to consider that the Petitioner had run

for his life due to death threats.

c) The Learned High Court Judge had failed to consider the notable

disparity in the punishment given to 2nd and 4th Accused as oppose

to the punishment of the Petitioner.

CA/PHC/APN 0005/23

It is settled law that revision is a discretionary remedy, and such power shall

be invoked only upon demonstration of exceptional circumstances.

In Ramu Thamodarampillai v. The Attorney General [2004] 3 SLR 180

the court held that:

the decision must in each case depend on its own peculiar facts and

circumstances.

In Marian Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed 69 CLW 34 the court held that:

Power of revision is an extraordinary power of the court which is

independent and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction. The

object of revisionary jurisdiction is to ensure the due

administration of justice and the correction of all errors in order to

avoid a miscarriage of justice.

In the case of Rasheed Ali v.Mohammed Ali and Others [1981] 1 SLR 262,

the court held that:

the powers of revision vested in the Court of Appeal are very

wide and the Court can in a fit case exercise that power whether

or not an appeal lies. When, however, the law does not give a right

of appeal and makes the order final, the Court of Appeal may

nevertheless exercise its powers of revision, but it should do so

only in exceptional circumstances. Ordinarily the Court will not

interfere by way of review, particularly when the law has

expressly given an aggrieved party an alternative remedy such

as the right to file a separate action, except when non-interference

will cause a denial of justice or irremediable harm.

In Commissioner of Police v. Tanes (1957-58) 68 CLR 383, the court held

that:

"It is a deep-rooted principle of the law that before anyone can be

punished or prejudiced in his person or his property by any

judicial or quasi-judicial procedure, he must be afforded adequate

opportunity of being heard ... "

In this case the Petitioner had absconded the court in the year 2008 and was

arrested in the year 2019 after seven years of the judgment. Although he had

come to Sri Lanka twice in 2015 and 2018, he had not taken any endeavour

to check the progress of his case. Further, he had taken up the position that

he was under death threat from an underworld figure who had died some

time back. The learned High Court Judge had very correctly considered these

matters in detail and had concluded that his absence to court was mala fide.

Therefore, his application under Section 241(3) of the CPC was rejected very

correctly.

Sentencing is the prerogative of the court. Accused who plead guilty will

usually receive a reduced sentence. The rational behind this is that it

encourages accused who know they are guilty to enter a guilty plea at the

earliest possible stage, so saving court time and money and saving witnesses

from having to attend court to give evidence. Further, victims are saved from

secondary victimization.

In this case the 2nd and 4th Accused had pleaded guilty to their respective

charges on 14.11.2011. The Learned High Court Judge after considering the

submissions of both parties passed the sentence which he considered

appropriate.

The Petitioner in this case absconded the court after the service of the

indictment and he twice came to Sri Lanka but not taken any endeavour to

check the status quo of his case. He was arrested by the Sevanagala Police

CA/PHC/APN 0005/23

9 | P a g e

after seven years of the warrant issued against him. Hence, the learned High

Court Judge had very correctly considered all these circumstances at the

241(3) CPC inquiry and passed the sentence imposed on him on 13.03.2012.

Therefore, the contention he advances under disparity of sentence cannot be

considered as an exceptional circumstance.

Considering all the materials placed before this court, I am of the view that

this is not a matter where extraordinary power of revision of this court should

be exercised in term of Article 138 of the Constitution. The Petitioner has not

submitted sufficient exceptional grounds which warrant the intervention of

this Court.

Therefore, this revision application is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgement to the High

Court of Embilipitiya for necessary implementation.
