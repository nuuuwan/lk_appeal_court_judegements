Facts In Brief

PW-01 Premawathi was married to Piyadasa mentioned in the counts against the

appellant, and was running a small boutique in her house situated at

Gatamaanna, Beliatta. She used to sell a type of Beedi called White Beedi in her

boutique supplied by one Siriwardana Pathiranage Lionel, who used to supply

this kind of Beedi to the shops situated around the area.

Her husband has been a farmer as well as a cinnamon peeler. On 25-03-2012,

around 10.30 in the morning, while she was in her boutique, two persons,

including the appellant whom she knew as an Excise Officer has come to the

boutique. The appellant has come inside and had asked for Beedi where she has

replied that she does not have any. However, the appellant who was in civilian

clothes has searched the boutique and has found several bundles of White Beedi

on her table.

Thereafter, the appellant has informed her that she will be fined Rs. 100/= for

each Beedi and has told her that he needs Rs. 5000/= upfront and Rs. 1000/=

every month thereafter to not to prosecute her and to allow her to carry on with

the selling of Beedi. After making the demand, taking down some notes and

requiring her to sign, the appellant has left. Before leaving, the appellant has

taken her mobile phone number and has given several phone calls to her

subsequently, demanding the money, informing that if not, action will be

instituted.

In the meanwhile, the husband of PW-01, namely Piyadasa, and Pathiranage

Lionel, who used to supply her with beedi has been arrested by the appellant

and several other officers at Tangalle for an alleged offence of consuming Ganja.

He has been produced before the Angunukolapalassa Magistrates Court and

fined. Since then, PW-01 and her husband have decided to lodge a complaint in

this regard with the Bribery Commission, and has lodged the complaint in April

2012, just after the New Year. Accordingly, Bribery Commission officials have

come and met her, and after recording a statement, has organized the raid which

Page 7 of 18

led to the arrest of the appellant. Rs 5000/= used in the said raid has been given

by the Bribery Commission officials to PW-01, which was in Rs. 1000/= notes.

PW-01 has selected one of the officers who came and met her to accompany her

as a decoy since he was a young person with boyish looks.

As the appellant has informed her to come near the liquor store situated in

Beliatta, she has gone there with the decoy in the morning, but the appellant

has not come. Later, on his instructions, she has again gone at around 3.30 in

the afternoon near the same place where the appellant has met her. He has

inquired whether the money was brought and has accepted the money from the

PW-01. He has also assured that she will not be prosecuted, but she will have to

pay Rs. 1000/= every month to carry on with the trade.

When this was happening, the decoy who was near her has grabbed hold of the

appellant, where the appellant has thrown the money he had in his hand. At the

same time, other officials of Bribery Commission have also come and arrested

the appellant.

In this matter, PW-01s husband Piyadasa has also given evidence and has

confirmed what his wife told him of the demand by the appellant. He has also

given evidence to the effect that while this demand was made and in progress,

he, along with Pathiranage Lionel, who supplied White Beedi, was arrested for

allegedly possessing Ganja and was charged at the Angunukolapalassa

Magistrates Court. According to his evidence, he has also gone to the Excise

Office at Tangalle to discuss the matter with the appellant where he has been

informed that it is he who will be charged and not the PW-01. In the process, the

appellant has made the same demand for Rs. 5000/= and Rs. 1000/= on each

month for him to turn a blind eye about the selling of White Beedi at their

boutique.

The decoy who accompanied PW-01 has corroborated the events that took place

before the appellant was arrested by the Bribery Commission officials. PW-04

Page 8 of 18

had been the officer who led the raiding party of the Bribery Commission. He has

also given evidence in relation to the complaint received and the investigations

carried out in that regard and also the raid that took place on 28-04-2012.

The prosecution has called Siriwardana Pathiranage Lionel as PW-05. He is the

alleged supplier of White Beedi to PW-01, as well as the person mentioned in 7th

to 12th counts preferred against the appellant. He has stated the manner in

which he manufactures White Beedi and had admitted that he had no permit to

manufacture such beedi. He has stated that two officers from the Excise

Department visited his home in March 2012 and the appellant who was one of

the officers demanded Rs. 10,000/= not to prosecute him for the offence of

manufacturing Beedi illegally. Accordingly, he has given Rs. 7000/= to the

appellant. He has also spoken of him and the husband of PW-01 been charged

for having Ganja in their possession before the Magistrates Court of

Angunukolapalassa. However, he has admitted that he gave Rs. 7000/= not to

the appellant directly, but to a Wine Store nominated by the appellant.

The prosecution has also called an official from the Angunukolapalassa

Magistrates Court to establish that the husband of PW-01 and earlier mentioned

Lionel was charged before the Court, and also an Excise Inspector to produce

relevant documents in that regard. He has also confirmed that the appellant was

an Excise Guard attached to Excise Office of Tangalle during the time relevant

to this incident.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case and when the learned trial Judge

decided to call for a defence from the appellant, he has made a lengthy dock

statement. He has denied that he ever solicited or accepted bribes from either

PW-01 or PW-05 Lionel. He has claimed that the PW-01 and her husband, along

with PW-05 made this false allegation against him due to the fact of his detection

of illegal drugs in their possession.

Page 9 of 18

He has also claimed that when this raid took place, he never took any money on

to his hand, but PW-01 forcibly attempted to put some money into his trouser

pocket, and he was arrested while this attempt was made.

On behalf of the appellant, Development Officer of the Divisional Secretariat

Office of Beliatta has been called to give evidence as to the Wine Store situated

in the area.

The Grounds of Appeal

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant,

based on his written submissions filed before the Court, relied on the following

grounds of appeal.

1. The indictment is contrary to law as the joinder of charges is contrary

to section 174 and 175 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979.

2. It has been proven that Piyadasa (PW-02) and Lionel (PW-05) have

deliberately uttered falsehood before the Court, therefore, their

evidence cannot be relied upon.

3. The evidence of PW-01 Premawathi cannot be relied upon.

4. The evidence of PW-02 cannot be relied upon.

5. The learned High Court Judge has failed to correctly and independently

evaluate the credibility of the evidence of PW-05 Lionel.

6. The evidence of PW-01 concerning the trap is contrary to the evidence

of PW-03.

7. The learned High Court Judge while accepting that there is a

discrepancy regarding the location where the trap took place, has failed

to give the benefit of the doubt to the appellant.

8. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the defence case.

It was the position of the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant that there

was a serious misjoinder of charges as count number 7 to 12 preferred against

the appellant were not related to a thing happened during the same transaction,

Page 10 of 18

but of an entirely different transaction occurred on different dates. It was his

position that this misjoinder has the effect of vitiating the conviction of the

appellant.

He also cited several instances where he stated as serious discrepancies in the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses of the raid, and the manner in which the

raid took place. He was also of the view that the evidence of Lionel (PW-05) in

relation the other incidents which involved him had been considered in a

prejudicial manner against the appellant by the learned High Court Judge in his

judgment. He was of the view that this has failed to guarantee a fair trial against

the appellant. He was also vivid in arguing that the learned High Court Judge

has failed to consider the defence put forward by the appellant in its correct

perspective.

The learned Counsel for the complainant-respondent in her submissions before

the Court conceded that there had been a misjoinder of charges in relation to

the 7th to 12th count preferred against the appellant. However, she relied on the

provisions of section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to argue that

since no prejudice has been caused to the appellant due to the said misjoinder,

the conviction in relation to 1st to 6th counts preferred against him should

remain.

It was her position that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt,

the said counts against the appellant, and there was no basis to argue that PW-

01 and other relevant witnesses have made up a story against the appellant. She

pointed out that the learned High Court Judge has well considered the defence

version of events in his evaluation of the evidence. It was moved that the

conviction in relation to the 1st to 6th counts preferred against the appellant

should be affirmed as there was no merit in the grounds of appeal urged on

behalf of the appellant in relation to the said counts.

Page 11 of 18

Consideration of The Grounds of Appeal

As the 1st ground of appeal urged relates to a fundamental question of law, I will

now proceed to consider the said ground of appeal before I move on to the other

grounds of appeal urged. It was contended and admitted that there was a

misjoinder of charges in relation to the 7th to 12th counts preferred against the

appellant as the said counts refers to a similar, but a different incident.

It needs to be noted that when the indictment was read over to the appellant or

at any stage during the trial, misjoinder of charges has not been pleaded and it

was only at the appeal stage, this position has been taken.

The case of Lionel Vs. Officer-In-Charge, Meetiyagoda Police Station (1987)

1 SLR 210 was a case very much similar to the facts relating to misjoinder of

charges urged in this appeal.

The 6 appellants, the 1st to 6th accused were charged by a Magistrate, who

was also an Additional District Judge, on count (1) with abducting one

Arnolis Silva from his house, and on count (2), 6 others, the 7th to 12th

accused were charged with causing mischief by damaging the house and

property of Arnolis Silva. No objection to the misjoinder of charges was

raised at the time the accused were charged, nor was an application made

for separate trials. After trial, the 1st 6 accused were convicted on count 1

and each of them was sentenced to 9 months rigorous imprisonment, and

the 7th accused was convicted on count 2 and fined Rs. 200/=.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the two offences referred to in

counts 1 and 2 were unconnected incidents and were not committed in

the course of the same transaction, and set aside the conviction and the

sentence of the 7th accused on count 2. But the sentence and conviction

of the 1st to 6th accused on count 1 were affirmed.

The appellants appealed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The

learned Counsel for the appellants contended that the misjoinder of

Page 12 of 18

charges is an illegality which vitiates the whole charge and not a curable

irregularity.

Held:

L.H. de Alwis, J. (Sharvananda, C.J. and H.A.G. de Silva, J. agreeing)

1. That the time at which it falls to be determined that the conditions

of the offences alleged had been committed in the course of the

same transaction had been fulfilled, is the time when the

accusation is made, and not when the trial is concluded and the

result is known.

2. That a misjoinder of charges is curable under provisions of the

Code of Criminal Procedure if there had been no actual or possible

failure of justice.

3. As the misjoinder in the present case has not prejudiced the

appellants and occasioned a failure of justice it amounts to an

irregularity that is curable under section 436 of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 and the appeal, therefore,

fails.

Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act referred to above reads as

follows.

436. Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained any judgment

passed by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be reversed or

altered on appeal or revision on account

(a) of any error, omission, or irregularity in the complaint,

summons, warrant, charge, judgment, summing up, or other

proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other

proceedings under this Code; or

(b) of the want of any sanction required by section 135,

Page 13 of 18

unless such error, omission, irregularity, or want has occasioned a

failure of justice.

It is abundantly clear from the judgment that the learned High Court Judge has

not used the evidence led through PW-05 Lionel in relation to the 7th to 12th

counts preferred against the appellant in determining 1st to 6th counts, where

the appellant was found guilty. It is quite apparent that it was the person called

Pathiranage Lionel (PW-05) who has supplied the White Beedi to the PW-01. It is

also in evidence that after soliciting a bribe of Rs. 5000/=, and Rs. 1000/=

monthly thereafter, the husband of PW-01 and the earlier mentioned Lionel has

been arrested for an alleged offence of possessing Ganja, and they have been

charged before the Angunukolapalassa Magistrates Court, although both of

them have denied in their evidence that they possessed Ganja and has taken up

the stand that they were falsely implicated. That is a factor which relates to the

1st to 6th counts preferred against the appellant, which I do not find as a reason

to consider that fact has caused prejudice towards the appellant, as that piece

of evidence cannot be considered as part of the evidence in relation to 7th to 12th

counts preferred against the appellant.

I am unable to agree with the contention of the learned Presidents Counsel that

the learned High Court Judge has considered the said pieces of evidence in a

prejudicial manner. Therefore, I am of the view that the said misjoinder in itself

would not have any vitiating effect on the conviction of the appellant in relation

to the 1st to 6th counts, as it has not caused any prejudice towards the appellant.

Since the 2nd to 7th grounds of appeal urged are grounds based on the credibility

of prosecution witnesses, I will now proceed to consider the said grounds of

appeal together, along with the 8th ground of appeal where it was contended that

the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the defence case.

It is abundantly clear from the relevant prosecution witnesses that PW-01 and

her husband (PW-02) or PW-05 for that matter, had no reason whatsoever to

falsely accuse the appellant for soliciting and accepting a bribe from PW-01.

Page 14 of 18

PW-01 had been a housewife, who ran a small boutique at her house where she

has sold White Beedi supplied by PW-05. It is an admitted fact that PW-05 had

no license to manufacture Beedi in such a manner. However, it has been

undisputed that Beedi manufactured by PW-05 has been commonly available in

the boutiques of the area. Under the circumstances, when PW-01 says that the

appellant being an Excise Guard came and detected some bundles of Beedi

available in her shop for sale and demanded Rs. 5000/= from her to not

prosecute her, and also Rs. 1000/= on every month for her to carry on with the

trade, it cannot be considered under any circumstances a concocted story.

Therefore, it is clear that the PW-01 and her husband have lodged a true

complaint in this regard to the Bribery Commission as they are entitled to. This

complaint has resulted in a raid being organized by the officers of the Bribery

Commission and the appellant being arrested while accepting Rs. 5000/= as

solicited by him previously.

Although the learned Presidents Counsel for the appellant claimed that there

were several inconsistencies in the evidence of PW-01, PW-02 and that of PW-

05, and that they have uttered deliberate falsehood in that regard, I have no

basis to agree with such a contention.

It is trite law that evidence in a criminal case has to be considered in its totality

and not in a piecemeal basis. It is quite apparent that when two persons describe

the same incident after several years of its occurrence, there can be obvious

discrepancies in that regard. Such discrepancies become relevant only if they

create a reasonable doubt in their evidence against an accused person. It is well-

settled law that no person is expected to have a photographic memory of an event

when describing that in a subsequent proceeding.

Page 15 of 18

At this stage, I find it appropriate to refer to the Indian case of Bhoginbhai

Hirjibhai Vs State of Gujarat (AIR 1983-SC 753 at pp 756-758) very often

cited in our Courts. It was held:

1) By and large a witness cannot be expected to possess a photographic

memory and to recall the details of an incident. It is not as if a video tape

is replayed on the mental screen.

2) Ordinarily, so happens that a witness is overtaken by events. The witness

could not have anticipated the occurrence which so often has an element

of surprise. The mental faculties therefore cannot be expected to be

attuned to absorb the details.

3) Ordinarily, a witness cannot be expected to recall accurately the sequence

of events which take place in rapid succession or in a short time span. A

witness is liable to get confused or mixed up when interrogated later on.

4) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court

atmosphere and the piercing cross-examination made by counsel and out

of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events,

or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The sub-

conscious mind of the witness sometime so operates on account of the

fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witnesses is giving

truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him perhaps

it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of

the moment.

The PW-01 not properly describing the location of the Wine Store which was near

the place the raid took place or whether the decoy held the appellant before the

other officers came and arrested him, were not matters that creates any doubt

as to the raid or discrepancies that goes on to the root of the matter.

Page 16 of 18

For a discrepancy or a contradiction to be relevant, it has to be a material

discrepancy or a contradiction.

Shiranee Thilakawardena, J. in the case of The Attorney General Vs. Potta

Naufar and Others (Ambepitiya Murder Case) (2007) 2 SLR 144 observed that;

when faced with contradictions in a testimonial of a witness, the Court

must bear in mind the nature and the significance of the contradiction.

the Court must come to a determination regarding whether these

contradictions were an honest mistake on the part of the witness or whether

it was a deliberate attempt to mislead Court.

In the case of Mahathun and Others Vs. The Attorney General (2015) 1 SLR

74 it was held:

(1) When faced with contradictions in a witness testimonial, the Court

must bear in mind the nature and significance of the contradictions,

viewed in light of the whole of the evidence given by the witness.

(2) Too great a significance cannot be attached to minor discrepancies, or

contradictions.

(3) What is important is whether the witness is telling the truth on the

material matters concerned with the event.

(4) Where evidence is generally reliable much importance should not be

attached to the minor discrepancies and technical errors.

(5) The Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb the findings of a trial judge

with regard to the acceptance or rejection of testimony of a witness

unless it is manifestly wrong.

In the case of State of U.P. Vs. M. K. Anthony, AIR 1985 SC 48, it was held:

While appreciating the evidence of a witness the approach must be whether

the evidence of a witness read as a whole appears to have a ring of truth.

Once that impression is formed, it is undoubtedly necessary for the Court to

scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies,

Page 17 of 18

drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and

evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of the

evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the

evidence is shaken as to tender it unworthy of belief.

Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case,

hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here or

there from the evidence, attaching importance to some technical error

committed by the investigating officer not going to the root of the matter

would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole.

I am unable to agree with the contention that the learned High Court Judge has

failed to consider the defence put forward by the appellant. In fact, the learned

High Court Judge has correctly noted that the appellant has failed to suggest the

relevant witnesses when they were giving evidence that he was enticed by them

to come to a place near a Wine Store in the guise of providing information and

hoisted a false bribery charge against him.

The learned High Court Judge has drawn his attention to the value that can be

attached to a dock statement made by an accused person and the relevant legal

provisions in that regard. The learned High Court Judge has considered whether

the dock statement or the questions put to the witnesses under cross-

examination or the position taken up by the appellant has created a reasonable

doubt as to the charges against the appellant or at least it has provided a

reasonable explanation.

It was only after considering the defence put forward by the appellant in its

correct perspective, and also after having considered the evidence in its totality,

the learned High Court Judge has found the appellant guilty to the 1st to 6th

count for which I find no basis to disagree.

Therefore, I do not find any basis to interfere with the conviction and the

sentence of the appellant in relation to the 1st to 6th count preferred against him

where he was found guilty.

Page 18 of 18

Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal against the said counts for want of merit, and

affirms the conviction and the sentence in that regard.

However, as I have discussed earlier, since the 7th and the 9th count where the

appellant was found guilty are counts based on a misjoinder of charges, I set

aside the conviction and the sentence of the appellant in relation to those two

counts, and acquit the appellant in relation to the 7th and the 9th count.

Since the appellant is on bail pending appeal, it is directed that the sentence in

relation to the 1st to 6th counts preferred against the appellant shall commence

from the date where the learned High Court Judge of Colombo pronounce this

judgment to the appellant.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

P. Kumararatnam, J.

I agree.
