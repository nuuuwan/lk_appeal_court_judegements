JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

This is an application in Revision preferred by the Accused-Petitioner

(Hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) challenging the order delivered

on 25.01.2023 by the learned Hogh Court Judge of Colombo dismissing

the preliminary objections raised at the pre-trial conference commenced

on 27.10.2022.

The matter was supported on 20.03.2023 and this Court had decided to

issue notice on the Respondent. On the notice returnable day i.e.

17.05.2023 the Counsel for the Petitioner supported for a stay order.

After hearing both parties, this Court issued a stay order as per prayer

C of the Petition.

The Petitioner was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for criminal

offences allegedly to have been committed on or about 10.04.2016. The

charges in the indictment are re-produced bellow:

1. On or about 10.04.2016 committing an offence in terms of

Section 403 read with Section 398 of the Penal Code by inducing

one Wewalage Rose Milton Fernando to give the accused a gem

worth about Rs.32,500,000/-.

2. In between 10.04.2016 to 30.04.2016 committing an offence in

terms of Section 25(1) of the Debt Recovery (special Provisions)

Act No. 02 of 1990 amended by Act No. 09 of 1994 by giving a

cheque No. 355551 worth of Rs. 5,000,000/- to Wewalage Rose

Milton Fernando.

3. In between 10.04.2016 to 30.04.2016 committing an offence in

terms of Section 25(1) of the Debt Recovery (special Provisions)

Act No. 02 of 1990 amended by Act No. 09 of 1994 by giving a

cheque No. 355553 worth of Rs. 3,000,000/- to Wewalage Rose

Milton Fernando.

4. In between 10.04.2016 to 30.04.2016 committing an offence in

terms of Section 25(1) of the Debt Recovery (special Provisions)

Act No. 02 of 1990 amended by Act No. 09 of 1994 by giving a

cheque No. 355555 worth of Rs. 12,500,000/- to Wewalage Rose

Milton Fernando.

5. In between 10.04.2016 to 30.04.2016 committing an offence in

terms of Section 25(1) of the Debt Recovery (special Provisions)

Act No. 02 of 1990 amended by Act No. 09 of 1994 by giving a

cheque No. 355556 worth of Rs. 12,500,000/- to Wewalage Rose

Milton Fernando.

At the commencement of the pre-trial conference, the Counsel for the

Appellant raised the preliminary objection against the maintainability of

the 2nd to 5th charge on the basis that the Debt Recovery (Special

Provisions) Act No 02 of 1990 as amended conferred Jurisdiction in the

Magistrate Court in respect of offences committed under Section 25(1)

of the said Act and as such the Hon Attorney General is not empowered

to forwarded an indictment to the High Court including charges in

terms of Section 25 (1) of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No.

02 of 1990.

CA (PHC)APN 25/2023

After the submissions by the Counsel for the Petitioner and the

prosecution, the Learned High Court Judge had overruled the

preliminary objection raised by the Petitioner and fixed the matter for

pre-trial conference 15.02.2023

Being aggrieved by the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo, the Petitioner had filed this instant Revision Application

invoking the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court urging on the

following exceptional circumstances.

a. The learned High Court Judge has misdirected himself in law by

holding Sec 393 of the Code od Criminal Procedure act No. 15 of

1979 is applicable to the Debt recovery (Special Provisions) Act No

02 of 1990 amended by Act No 09 of 1994 when the Sec 393 of

the Criminal Procedure code very clearly states that it is only

applicable to the Criminal Procedure Code.

b. The Honourable High Court Judge has misdirected himself in law

by granting leave to the Hon Attorney General to include charges

framed under Sec 25 (1) of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions)

Act No 02 of 1990 amended by the act No 09 of 1994.

c. The Honourable High Court Judge has misdirected himself by

failing to consider the well maxim of interpretation Generalia

Specialibus no Derogant.

d. The Honourable High Court Judge has misdirected himself by

failing to consider that the Legislature has specifically conferred

the jurisdiction over offences which are committed in terms of Sec

25(1) of the Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No 02 of 1990

amended by the act No 09 of 1994 to the Magistrate Courts.

CA (PHC)APN 25/2023

It is well settled law that the revision is a discretionary remedy that can

be granted only upon exceptional circumstances.

In Wijesinghe v Tharmaratnam (Sri kantha Law Report Vol-IV 47), the

court held that:

Revision is a discretionary remedy and will not be available

unless the application discloses circumstances which shocks the

conscience of the Court.

In Hotel Galaxy (Pvt) Ltd. V Mercantile Hotels Management Ltd.

1987 1 SLR 5 the Court held that:

It is settled law that the exercise of the revisionary powers of the

appellate Court is confined to cases in which exceptional

circumstances exist warranting its intervention.

The main argument of the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

High Court has no jurisdiction to try offences under Section 25(1) of the

Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of 1990 as amended by

Act No. 04 of 1994 as the Act confers jurisdiction to the Magistrate

Court to try the said offences.

In this context, it is very pertinent to discuss Section 393(7) of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 which reads as follows:

Notwithstanding any other provisions contained in this Act, it shall

be lawful for the Attorney-General, having regard to the nature of

CA (PHC)APN 25/2023

the offence or any other circumstances, in respect of any summary

offence - (a) to forward an indictment directly to the High Court, or

(b) to direct the Magistrate to hold a preliminary inquiry in

accordance with the procedure set out in Chapter XV in respect of

any offence specified by him where he is of opinion that the evidence

recorded at a preliminary inquiry will be necessary for preparing an

indictment;

and thereupon such offence shall not be triable by a Magistrate's

Court.

In an identical issue, Sisira De Abrew, J. in Sellaiya Sribalan v The

Attorney General CA(PHC) APN 09/2012 decided on 29.03.2012 after

considering the Section 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and the

Section 9(1) of the Judicature Act, held that:

When the above legal provisions are considered, I hold the view that

the Attorney General has the power to send an indictment to the High

Court in respect of a summary offence (an offence triable by the

Magistrate) and when such an indictment is forwarded, The High

Court Judge has the power to hear, try and determine the case and

that the Magistrate loses jurisdiction to hear such a case.

In this case the decision taken to try the charges preferred under the

Debt Recovery Act No.02 of 1990 as amended in the indictment is not

opened to challenge as it is the decision of the Attorney General under

the power vested on him under Section 393(7) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

Hence, the High Court under Section 9(1) of the Judicature Act, has the

jurisdiction to hear, try and determine the indictment which include

summery offences triable by the Magistrate.

Hence, I affirm the order of Learned High Court Judge dated

25.01.2023 and dismiss this revision application of want of any

exceptional circumstances.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this Judgment to the

High Court of Colombo for information.
