Facts of the Case

The facts of the case are that, where the 2nd Petitioner, who was the daughter of the 1st

Petitioner, a student of the Gateway School of Negambo was punished along with other

students on 12.01.2018 by a teacher of the aforesaid school for the reason of neglecting to

bring the English reading book on the particular day.

The punishment was that they were made to kneel down in the classroom for several

minutes and the teacher has pulled the 2nd Petitioners ear violently. Therefore the 1st

Petitioner complained to the Principal against the teacher.

Since the Principal failed to take any action against the said Teacher, 1st Petitioner made

a complaint to the Seeduwa Police Station. There was an undertaking given by the

Principal that, the 2nd Petitioner would no longer be harassed as the said teacher has

resigned and the matter was amicably settled between the parties.

According to the 1st Petitioner, despite the aforesaid undertaking given by the Principal,

the 2nd Petitioner complained that she was constantly harassed by the teachers and other

students. Therefore he has proffered a complaint to the 2nd Respondent on 25.01.2018

regarding the punishment given to his daughter. On the complaint, the 1st Respondent

reported the facts to the Magistrate Court of Negambo bearing the case No. L60041/18.

The Learned Magistrate has referred this matter to the Hon, Attorney General for further

advice.

Page 7 of 8

According to the Petitioner, the Hon. Attorney General has advised to the 2nd Respondent

that a plausible charge against the suspect could be the injury caused to the 2nd Petitioner.

According to the written submission filed by the Respondent, it indicates that the

particular DVD and the Government Analyst Report were later sent to the Hon. Attorney

General to obtain further advice by the 2nd Respondent while this case is pending before

this Court.

They have further pleaded that, the 16th Respondent now considering whether there is

any fresh evidence available against the suspect to prosecute or not. The issue before us

is, whether the Petitioner has a legal right to compel the Attorney General to perform his

duties. The prosecutorial discretion to arrive at a decision after considering the facts and

circumstances, the Attorney General is vested with vast powers under section 393 of the

criminal procedure code. The said discretion could not be challenged unless the Petitioner

shows that the Attorney General action is mala fide.

In the Case of Fakhir v. Attorney General 2021 (1) SLR 230 at Page 235,

Obeyesekere,J.P/CA held that;

It is significant to note that the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is not alleging

dishonesty or ma/a fides on the part of the Attorney General in indicting the Petitioner,

but, as I have already stated, is only complaining that there is no factual basis to sustain

the charge against the Petitioner.

In the instant case the Petitioner has not alleged that the Attorney Generals actions are

mala fide or not have properly considered the evidence placed before him. Therefore, we

hold that the decision taken by the Hon. Attorney General is lawful.

In addition the Petitioner has prayed for Writ of Mandamus compelling the 16th

Respondent to prosecute the matter expeditiously. We are mindful that any person seeks

for writ of mandamus must show that there is a legal duty towards him by the party

against whom the mandamus is sought.

In the instant application, the Petitioner has failed to establish that the Attorney General

has a legal duty towards him, to prosecute the matter expeditiously before the Magistrate

Court Negambo in case bearing No L60041/18.

Page 8 of 8

This was considered in the following judgment,

In Ratnayake and Others v C.D. Perera and Others [1982] 2 SLR at 4501 page 456

Sharvananda, J. (as he was then) with Victor Perera, J. and Colin-Thome, J. agreeing

held;

The general rule of mandamus is that its function is to compel a public authority to do

its duty. The essence of mandamus is that it is a command issued by the Superior Court

for the performance of public legal duty. Where officials have a public duty to perform and

have refused to perform, mandamus will lie to secure the performance of the public duty,

in the performance of which the applicant has sufficient legal interest.

The above judgment was followed in the following case.

Janak Housing (Pvt) Ltd. And Another v. Urban Development Authority, [2008] 2

SLR 302 at page 304, S. Sriskandarajah,J.

The petitioner to seek a writ of mandamus must show that there resides in him a legal

right to the performance of a legal duty by the party against whom the mandamus is

sought. Therefore that a mandamus may be issued to compel something to be done

under a statute and it must be shown that the statute imposes a legal duty.

For the above said reasons, we dismiss this application with costs.
