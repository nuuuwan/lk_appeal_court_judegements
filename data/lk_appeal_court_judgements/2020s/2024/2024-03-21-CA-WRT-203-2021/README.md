RESPONDENTS Before: M. T. MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J. S. U. B. KARALIYADDE, J. Counsel:

Chrismal Warnasuriya with Prabudda Hettiarachchi, instructed by I. Wijesinghe for the Petitioner. Dr. Romesh de Silva PC with S. V. Niles, instructed by Julius and Creasy for the 1st to 4th Respondents. Argued on : 18.05.2023, 29.05.2023 Written Submissions on : 02.11.2023 (by Petitioner) 01.11.2023 (by 1st 4th Respondents) Decided on: 21.03.2024 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner in this Application is seeking a direction to the 1st to 3rd

Respondents to present all records and documents which they rely on, to

arrive at the marks which had been awarded to the Petitioner (in the OB and

ME subjects in her continuous assessments her 5th Semester in the year 2020

as depicted on document dated 26.01.2021 marked P10; A mandate in the

nature of Writs of Certiorari quashing the impugned purported determination

of the 1st to 4th Respondents to deny the Petitioner her entitlement to

information of her Assessments and End Semester Examinations for the

subjects OB and ME in the 5th Semester in the year 2020 (communication

Page 3 of 10

dated 04.03.2021 marked P17) and the results sheet containing the purported

marks for her Continuous Assessments and End Semester Examinations for

OB and ME for the 5th Semester in the year 2020, as contained in document

dated 26.01.2021 marked 'P10' and A mandate in the nature of a Writ of

Mandamus directing the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents to act in accordance

with the law and disclose to the Petitioner information of the marking of her

Continuous Assessments and End Semester Examinations in the OB and ME

subjects for the 5th Semester in the year 2020,as reflected on the result sheet

dated 26.01.2021 marked 'P10'.

During the hearing of the matter, by Order dated 18.05.2023 this Court has

permitted the Petitioner to proceed only against the 1st and 3rd Respondents

as the 2nd and 4th Respondents ceased to hold office and the Petitioner did not

take steps to amend the caption.

According to the Petitioner, the crux of the matter pertains primarily to the

withholding of information and absence of transparency by the 1st

Respondent Institute concerning the Petitioner's examinations and their

outcomes. The Petitioner submits that these actions have profound and

enduring ramifications on her future prospects, both within the academic

realm and within her elected vocation as an Accountant since the computed

final "Grade Point Average" (GPA) serves as the determinant for the

categorization of her Degree Award, dictating whether she attains an Honours

Degree with First or Second-Class distinction.

The 1st Respondent Institution has been established in terms of the Institute

of Chartered Accountants Act No. 23 of 1959 which is the Professional Body in

Sri Lanka with the authority to award the title Chartered Accountant' to its

members. The School of Accounting and Business (SAB) has been established

in 2013 in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act No.16 of 1978 and is a

"Degree Awarding Institution" in terms of the Law. On 20.03.2018 the

Petitioner enrolled as a 1st year student at the said School of Accounting and

Page 4 of 10

Business (SAB) under Registration No. SAB/BSc/2018/A/ 46, to read for the

course leading to the award of B.Sc in Applied Accounting.

It is submitted that the Petitioner has attained and consistently upheld an

exemplary academic standing throughout, as evidenced by her performance

in all four semester examinations. Notably, she was one of only two students

to receive 'A's across all her subjects during the 4th semester examination

conducted on 15.10.2020 (referenced in documents marked 'P3 to P6').

The end-of-semester examinations have been held on 12.09.2020,

19.09.2020, 03.10.2020 and 07.03.2021 respectively. The final grading has

been determined by combining the results of continuous assignments (40%)

and the examination results (60%), as outlined in document 'P8'. The

assignments were due for submission between June and August 2020. The

Petitioner asserts that she duly submitted them, specifically for the subjects

of Organizational Behavior (OB) and Managerial Economics (ME), which are

the subjects under dispute. The submissions were made promptly along with

those for Audit & Assurance (AA) and Strategic Management (SM), as

evidenced in documents 'P7(a)' to 'P7(f)'. Around the 20.12.2020, the

Petitioner has been informed by the Student Coordinator of the 1st

Respondent to resubmit her assignment for ME, as it had purportedly been

misplaced. This communication is documented in emails marked 'P9(a)' and

'P9(b)'.

The final grades for the subjects OB and ME, among others, were disclosed

on or about the 26.01.2021. The Petitioner has then observed that her results

were significantly lower than anticipated and inconsistent with her previous

academic performance. Specifically, she had received a grade of B+ for OB

and a C+ for ME, as indicated in the contested results sheet marked 'P10'.

Expressing concern, the Petitioner has sought clarification via email dated the

26.01.2021, requesting the 2nd and 3rd Respondents to conduct a

reassessment of her assignments and end-of-semester examination papers for

Page 5 of 10

the aforementioned subjects. It was argued, with reference to evidence from

comparable institutions both domestically and internationally, that such

reassessment is a prerogative accorded to undergraduate students.

On or about the 03.02.2021, the 3rd Respondent declined the Petitioner's plea

for reassessment which was communicated to her via email. The response

asserted the absence of a procedure for reassessment at the 1st Respondent

Institute. This stance is vigorously contested by the Petitioner.

The disputed marks of 24 for OB and 20 for ME were issued to the Petitioner

by the 1st Respondent. Subsequently, these marks were verified by the

relevant lecturers responsible for the respective subjects (documents 'P12(a)'

and 'P13'). The validity of these marks, along with the underlying procedure,

is brought into question before this Court.

It is asserted by the Petitioner that the denial of the right to reassessment is

arbitrary and unreasonable, particularly considering that the final result

determines the overall GPA and consequently impacts the Petitioner's

prospects of achieving a favorable grade for the ultimate award of the BSc

degree (documents 'P14' to 'P15(b)').

On or about 16.02.2021, the Petitioner made a formal Demand to the 4th

Respondent, reiterating her request for reassessment of her assignments and

final semester examinations for the subjects of Organizational Behavior (OB)

and Managerial Economics (ME). Additionally, she demanded the disclosure

of the marking scheme used to calculate the final grades (referenced in

document 'P16'). The response received around 04.03.2021, from the 4th

Respondent persisted in denying the requested reassessment, purportedly

citing the absence of a procedural framework for such action, a contention

which is disputed. Furthermore, there was a refusal to disclose the marking

guidelines, a stance also contested (document 'P17').

In the said background the Petitioner asserts that the impugned decisions,

along with the entirety of the conduct in question, are alleged to be illegal,

irrational, procedurally improper, and in violation of legitimate expectations.

The primary contention of the Respondents in this regard is that the

consistent practice of the 1st Respondent has been to withhold or not release

or reveal information concerning the evaluation of assessments and/or

examinations. Additionally, they have never provided students with access to

the records or documents utilized in determining final marks. Furthermore,

they assert that there exists no formalized procedure within the institution for

the reconsideration or re-evaluation of assessments i.e. 're-assessment' and

therefore, the Respondents are of the view that the Petitioner is not entitled

to any such re-assessments.

The Respondents also plead that the Petitioner has wrongfully suppressed

that previously she has got a "C" grade and B grades for several subjects.

However, the Petitioners position is that she has obtained sufficient A grades

for a higher results depending on the outcome of the results impugned in this

Application.

Attention of this Court is drawn towards the impugned determinations

marked P10 & P17 which the Petitioner claims to be Irrational (or

Unreasonable) and also Procedurally Improper (failed to observe the Rules of

Natural Justice)

In the decision of Dr. C. J. A. Jayawardena Vs University of Colombo (CA

(Writ) Application No: 137/2018 decided on: 22nd June 2020)

Arjuna Obeyesekere, J, observed as follows:

"This Court is therefore of the view that while due recognition will be given

to the view of the decision maker, whether the decision relates to

academic matters or otherwise, this Court can, and will, in the

exercise of the jurisdiction vested in it by Article 140 of the Constitution,

Page 7 of 10

examine whether the impugned decision of the 1st Respondent is tainted

with illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety"

In Dr. Karunanada Vs. Open University of Sri Lanka and Others (2006)

3 SLR 225) Shirani Bandaranayake J. states as follows:

Although there may be cautionary remarks indicating reluctance to enter

into academic judgment, I am not in agreement with the view that

academic decisions are beyond challenge.

The Petitioner has instituted this action in particular, claiming that she is

entitled to exercise her right to know how those marks were arrived at and to

subject it to a process of reassessment as a student of a "degree awarding

institution" governed under Sri Lankan law. While the Respondents plead that

they have no established procedure and/or practice to facilitate 're-

assessment of exam results as per the existing guidelines, the Petitioner also

submits that even the mother institution of the 1st Respondent University,

University of La Trobe (Australia) has an established procedure for re-

assessment (marked 'P8' p.43 and 'A1') and therefore the conduct of the

Respondents are unreasonable and irrational. This court observes that while

the Respondents state that they have no particular procedure, they have failed

to justify as to why such procedure is not in place.

De Smith's Judicial Review (8th Edition,2018 Sweet and Maxwell, p.605) reads

as follows:

It is observed that "Irrationality may also sometimes be inferred

from the absence of reasons. When reasons are required, either by

statute or by the growing common law requirements, or where they are

provided, even though not strictly required, those reasons must be both

"adequate and intelligible".

Page 8 of 10

The process of "re-assessment" is a standardized procedure and practice

acknowledged within "degree awarding institutions" established and

regulated under the University Grants Commission according to the

provisions of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978. Particularly the UGC

Circular No. 978 dated 09.04.2012, all universities and higher educational

institutes are mandated to incorporate provisions for the re-examination of

marks and grades in undergraduate studies (marked 'P25').

It is also submitted that all universities and Higher Education institutions in

Sri Lanka which are subject to the by-laws, regulations and circulars of the

University Grant Commission are expressly required to incorporate a

procedure for 're-scrutinization of marks in relation to internal as well as

external undergraduate degree programmes. Further attention of court was

drawn to the system in place for re-scrutiny of marks at University of

Peradeniya and also G.C.E Ordinary and Advanced Level Examinations and

the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination,

This Court observes that access to have one's results reassessed has become

a standard practice in all institutions of learning, and it is practiced by many

establishments governed under the laws of Sri Lanka, particularly where

widespread recognition and implementation of the right to reassessment

across various educational and professional settings is acknowledged and

given effect to.

In Dr. Kaunanadas Case (Supra) Shirani Bandaranayake J, observes as

follows:

"Procedural fairness, in my view, cannot be regarded as a matter which

is unimportant. Procedural safeguards should be the cornerstones of

individual liberty and their right to equality. Referring to the importance

of procedural fairness, Justice Frankfurter in McNabb v. United States

stated that the history of liberty has largely been the history of the

observance of procedural safeguards. A decade later, considering an

Page 9 of 10

issue on the same lines, Justice Jackson in Shaughnessy v. United States

stated that "Procedural fairness and regularity are of the indispensable

essence of liberty. Several substantive laws can be endured if they are

fairly and impartially applied."

Thus, considering all facts analysed above including the conduct and past

performance of the student and importance for a cogent system of re-scrutiny

within established degree awarding institutions of the University Grants

Commission, I am of the view that the Petitioner is entitled to a re-assessment

as identified herein.

In the aforesaid circumstances, this Court is obliged to direct the 1st and 3rd

Respondents to present all records and documents which they rely on, to

arrive at the marks which had been awarded to the Petitioner (in the OB and

ME subjects in her continuous assessments for her 5th Semester in the year

2020) as depicted on document dated 26.01.2021 marked P10; and this

Court is inclined to grant a Writ of Certiorari quashing the impugned

purported determination of the 1st to 4th Respondents to deny the Petitioner

her entitlement to information of her Assessments and End Semester

Examinations for the subjects OB and ME in the 5th Semester in the year

2020 as depicted in communication dated 04.03.2021 marked 'P17'; a Writ of

Certiorari quashing the results sheet containing the purported marks for her

Continuous Assessments and End Semester Examinations for OB and ME for

the 5th Semester in the year 2020, as contained in document dated

26.01.2021 marked 'P10' and a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus

directing the Respondents to disclose to the Petitioner information of the

marking of her Continuous Assessments and End Semester Examinations in

the OB and ME subjects for the 5th Semester in the year 2020, as reflected on

the result sheet dated 26.01.2021 marked 'P10'.
