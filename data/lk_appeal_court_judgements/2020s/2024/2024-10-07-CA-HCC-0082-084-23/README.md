This is an appeal by the accused-appellants (hereinafter referred as the

appellants) on the basis of being aggrieved of their conviction and sentence by

the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle. The three appellants were the 1st, 2nd

and the 3rd accused in the High Court case where they were indicted along with

2 others for committing the following offences.

1. Being members of an unlawful assembly with the intention of causing

injuries to one Jasin Arachchige Karunasena on or about 28-08-1996,

at a place called Buwaliara within the jurisdiction of the High Court of

Tangalle, and thereby committed an offence punishable in terms of

section 140 of the Penal Code.

2. At the same time and at the same transaction, they caused the death

of the earlier mentioned Karunasena, while being members of the said

unlawful assembly, and thereby committed the offence of murder,

punishable in terms of section 296 read with section 146 of the Penal

Code.

3. At the same time and at the same transaction, they caused the death

of the earlier mentioned Karunasena, and thereby committed the

offence of murder punishable in terms of section 296 read with section

32 of the Penal Code.

After a lengthy trial which has taken 28 years to conclude from the date of the

offence, the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle of his judgment dated 16-12-

2022 found the appellants as well as the 4th and the 5th accused indicted not

guilty for the 1st and 2nd counts preferred against them, which were the counts

relating to unlawful assembly and causing death while being members of the

said unlawful assembly. The 4th and the 5th accused indicted were also acquitted

of the 3rd count preferred against them, as there was no evidence against the

said accused in relation to the charges.

Having considered the evidence placed before the Court, the learned High Court

Judge convicted the appellants for the offence of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder in terms of section 297 of the Penal Code.

After having considered the aggravating and the mitigatory circumstances, the

learned High Court Judge, of his sentencing order dated 18-01-2023, sentenced

the appellants in terms of the 1st limb of section 297 of the Penal Code for a term

of 15 years rigorous imprisonment each. The appellants were ordered to pay a

fine of Rs. 100,000/- each, and in default, to serve a sentence of 6 months each

simple imprisonment.

At the hearing of this appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel who represented

the appellants intimated to the Court that he will no longer challenge the

conviction of the appellants, but only the sentence imposed upon them on the

basis that the sentence should have been in terms of the 2nd limb of section 297

of the Penal Code.

Accordingly, upon the withdrawal, the appeal against the conviction is hereby

dismissed.

The Court heard the views expressed by the learned Presidents Counsel to

substantiate his argument that the sentence should have been in terms of the

2nd limb of section 297 of the Penal Code. This Court also heard the views

expressed by the learned Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) who represented the

complainant-respondent in this regard.

For better understanding of this judgment, I think it is appropriate to reproduce

the relevant part of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge where it has

been determined that the conviction should be in terms of section 297 of the

Penal Code (at page 397 of the appeal brief).

It was the submission of the learned Presidents Counsel that, the learned High

Court Judge has determined the matter not on the basis of knowledge or

intention, but under the 2nd limb of section 293 of the Penal Code where culpable

homicide has been defined. The relevant section reads as follows.

293. Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of

causing death or with the intention of causing such bodily injury as

is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he is likely to by

such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide.

He was of the view that in fact, the consideration should have been in terms of

the 3rd limb of section 293, given the facts and the circumstances and the

reasoning considered by the learned High Court Judge in his judgment. The

learned Presidents Counsel contended that the three appellants were young

persons when this incident occurred, and the evidence clearly shows that the

incident occurred as a result of a sudden fight without the offender having taken

undue advantage or has acted in a cruel or unusual manner. He also drew the

attention of Court to the medical evidence where the Judicial Medical Officer

(JMO) who conducted the post-mortem has expressed the opinion that the

injuries suffered by the deceased were not fatal in the ordinary course of nature

and the death has occurred due to the delay or not taking the deceased to a

hospital where he could have been given necessary medical attention.

The submission of the learned DSG was to the effect that the learned High Court

Judge was correct when it was decided to sentence the appellants in terms of

the 1st limb of 297 of the Penal Code.

However, the learned DSG agreed that the learned High Court Judge has not

stated under what exception of section 294 of the Penal Code he is determining

that the offence committed by the appellants would amount to culpable homicide

not amounting to murder. It was her view that the evidence of PW-03 and 04,

the main eyewitnesses to the incident, clearly showed that the appellants had

the intention of causing death or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to

cause death. She was of the view that there was no basis before this Court to

reconsider the sentence imposed upon the appellants as the learned High Court

Judge has pronounced a considered sentencing order when sentencing the

appellants.

Having considered the relevant facts and the circumstances that led to the death

of the deceased person and the conviction of the appellants in terms of section

297 of the Penal Code, although I find no reason to disagree with the learned

High Court Judges determination that the conviction should be in terms of

section 297 on the basis of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, I find

that the learned High Court Judge has failed to properly reason out his

determination in that regard.

It is my considered view that every causing of death of a person by another

person with criminal intent would amount to culpable homicide in terms of

section 293 of the Penal Code unless such causing of death falls within the

special or general exceptions as provided for in the Penal Code.

Culpable homicide is murder in terms of section 294 of the Penal Code under

the following circumstances.

Page 7 of 11

294. Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is

murder-

Firstly- if the act by which the death is caused is done with the

intention of causing death; or

Secondly- If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury

as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to

whom the harm is caused ; or

Thirdly- If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any

person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in

the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or

Fourthly- If the person committing the act knows that it is so

imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or

such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act

without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such

injury as aforesaid.

For a trial Court to determine culpable homicide is not murder, but falls under

the category of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in terms of section

297 of the Penal Code, there must be a determination under any one or more of

the five exceptions stated in section 294.

I find that the learned High Court Judge has failed to state in the judgment

under which exception he is determining that the offence committed by the

appellants amounts to culpable homicide not amounting to murder in terms of

section 297 of the Penal Code. However, having considered the relevant evidence

placed before the Court, I am of the view that the determination should have

been under exception 4 of section 294 of the Penal Code, which reads thus;

Page 8 of 11

Explanation 4.-

Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without

premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden

quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or

acted in a cruel or unusual manner.

Explanation

It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or

commits the first assault.

The way the learned High Court Judge has considered evidence shows that there

had been a quarrel between the deceased, the appellants and some others. This

has resulted in the deceased being attacked after the appellants got hold of the

knife the deceased was carrying at the time of the incident. The injuries caused

to the deceased shows that the said injuries have not been caused in a cruel or

unusual manner, but as a result of a sudden fight in the heat of passion.

Therefore, it is my view that when sentencing the appellants, the relevant facts

and the circumstances should have been considered in order to determine

whether sentencing of the appellants should be in terms of limb 1 or limb 2 of

section 297.

In this regard, I would like to cite the judgment pronounced by the Indian

Supreme Court, which considered the applicability of exceptions stated in

section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, which is the corresponding provision to

section 294 of our Penal Code. In the case of Jai Prakash Vs. State (Delhi

Administration) 1991 SCR (1) 202.

Held;

Intention is different from motive or ignorance or negligence. It is the

knowledge or intention with which that act is done that makes difference,

Page 9 of 11

in arrival at a conclusion whether the offence is culpable homicide or murder.

[208-E]

The language of Clause Thirdly of Section 300 speaks of intention at two

places and in each the sequence is to be established by the prosecution

before the Court that it can fall in that Clause. The intention and

knowledge of the accused are subjective and invisible states of mind and

their existence has to be gathered from the circumstances, such as the

weapon used, the ferocity of attack, multiplicity of injuries and all other

surrounding circumstances. The framers of the Code designedly used the

words intention and knowledge and it is accepted that the knowledge of

the consequences which may result in doing an act is not the same thing as

the intention that such consequences should ensue. Firstly, when an act is

done by a person, it is presumed that he, must have been aware that certain

specified harmful consequences would or could follow. But the knowledge

is bare awareness and not the same thing as intention that such

consequences should ensue. As compared to knowledge, intention

requires something more than the mere foresight of the consequences,

namely the purposely doing of a thing to achieve a particular end. [211H-

212C]

Knowledge as contrasted with intention signify a state of mental

realization with the bare state of conscious awareness of certain facts in

which human mind remains supine or inactive. On the other hand,

intension is a conscious state in which mental faculties are aroused into

actively and summoned into action for the purpose of achieving a conceived

end. [213B-C]

In the case of The King Vs. Aldon (1943) 44 NLR 575, it was held;

Where, in a charge of murder, the Court of criminal appeal is satisfied that

there was some doubt as to whether the jury were of opinion that the

Page 10 of 11

accused had a murderous intention or merely the knowledge that what he

did was likely to cause death,-

Held, that the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt and

sentenced under the latter part of section 297 of the Penal Code.

It is clear from the evidence placed before the trial Court that the appellants had

the knowledge that their actions would be likely to cause death, but there was

no evidence before the Court that they actually intended to cause death.

Although the deceased had died as a result of the injuries caused to him, the

opinion of the JMO had been to the effect that they were not injuries that would

have caused the death in the ordinary course of nature. His death has occurred

because of the fact that he has not been given proper medical attention.

The evidence placed before the trial Court establishes the fact that it was not

only the appellants, but there had been several other persons present, including

the relatives of the deceased, when this incident occurred. However, the deceased

had not been taken to a hospital, which has resulted in his death as a result of

the excessive bleeding from the injuries. It is my considered view, that fact

cannot be held against the appellants to conclude that they intended to cause

the death of the deceased.

It is my view that, the sentence in terms of section 297 should have been in

terms of the 2nd limb of the said section as the act had been done with the

knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without the intention of causing

death.

For the reasons as set out above, I am in no position to agree with the contention

of the learned DSG that a sentence of 15 years rigorous imprisonment can be

justified.

Accordingly, I vary the sentencing order dated 18-01-2023 by the learned High

Court Judge of Tangalle where each of the appellants were sentenced for a period

of 15 years each rigorous imprisonment to read that their period of rigorous

Page 11 of 11

imprisonment should be 10 years each in terms of the 2nd limb of section 297 of

the Penal Code.

I order that, the fines ordered and the default sentences imposed shall remain

the same.

Having considered the fact that the appellants had been in incarceration from

their date of conviction on 18-01-2023, I order that their period of 10 years

rigorous imprisonment shall deem to have commenced on 18-01-2023.

The appeal against the sentence is partly allowed up to the above extent.
