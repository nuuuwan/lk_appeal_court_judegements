JUDGMENT

P. Kumararatnam, J.

The above-named Accused-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

Appellant) was indicted by the Attorney General in the High Court of

Colombo under Section 54(A) (d) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous

Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 for Possession of 2.67

grams of Heroin (diacetylmorphine) on 04.07.2000.

After trial, the Appellant was found guilty as charged and the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo sentenced the Appellant to life imprisonment on

31.08. 2018.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence the Appellant

preferred this appeal to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the Appellant informed this court that the Appellant

has given his consent to argue this matter in his absence. At the hearing,

the Appellant was connected via Zoom platform from prison.

In this case, the raid was conducted based on a specific information received.

The raid was headed by PW1 along with seven police officers from the Police

Narcotics Bureau. Each of them including the Government Analyst has been

named as witnesses in the indictment. The prosecution had called PW1,

CA/HCC/0332/18

3 | P a g e

PW2, PW4, and PW09 and marked productions P1 to P7 and Z in support of

their case. The Government Analysts qualifications were admitted under

Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

When the defence was called, the Appellant had given evidence from the

witness box and called four witnesses to provide evidence on his behalf and

moved for further time to call more witnesses. Due to an unforeseen incident,

this matter came before a new judge on 02.12.2004. On that day the defence

Counsel made an application for a trial de novo. The application was

accepted and a trial de novo was ordered. When this matter came before

another judge on 07.06.2005, the same de novo application was made by the

appellant and amidst great resistance from the prosecution the learned High

Court Judge holding in favour of the Appellant, ordered a de novo trial and

all prosecution witnesses were summoned. Hence, a new trial commenced

on 09.11.2005.

After leading the evidence of PW1, PW2, and PW4, the prosecution made an

application to adopt the evidence of PW9, the Government Analyst who gave

evidence in the first trial before the learned High Court Judge (deceased). As

the defence did not object, it was decided to adopt only the evidence given by

PW9 in the first trial. After closing of the prosecution, the defence was called

and the learned Counsel for the defence filed a list of witnesses amounting

to about 11 witnesses. As several witnesses out of the 11 had already given

evidence in the first trial, the Counsel for the Appellant made an application

to adopt their evidence too. The application was allowed and summons

issued only against the remaining witnesses in the defence list.

When the Appellant gave evidence, he stated that he was not arrested with

Heroin as contended but was arrested at his residence. At that point, the

learned High Court Judge misunderstanding that the Appellant was going to

raise the defence of alibi, disallowed the evidence that the Appellant was

arrested at his residence. Due to this order, the learned Counsel for the

Appellant informed the Court that he was unable to call the remaining

witnesses without leading evidence that the Appellant was arrested at his

CA/HCC/0332/18

4 | P a g e

residence. Hence, the defence was closed and the case was fixed for

submissions.

A revision application under case No. CA/PHC/APN 116/2010 was filed to

quash the order made by learned High Court Judge on 11.05.2010. After

hearing both the sides, His Lordship P/CA held that:

Learned Senior State Counsel who appears for the Attorney General

contends that due process and ends of justice would be best served if this

matter goes back to the High Court for the evidence that had been

excluded, to be led afresh and the trial concluded to a finish, for the reason

that the same evidence had been permitted at the previous trial in 2004

and that can be considered as a notice given to the prosecution of the case

that the accused was seeking to present at his trial.

Learned Counsel for the accused-petitioner also submits that he has no

objection to the adoption of the entire prosecution evidence that had been

led up to the point of the conclusion of the prosecution case. He further

submits that the defence evidence at the further trial would focus mostly

on items of evidence that were excluded by the trial Judge.

In the circumstances, this Court is of the view that the order made by the

learned High Court Judge dated 11.05.2010 (P2) should be set aside and

the matter is sent back for further trial.

As per the above Judgment, the learned High Court Judge on 28.04.2015

and 27.06.2016 made an order to continue the trial with the evidence led at

that point and allowed the defence to file their list of witnesses. On

29.09.2015 the Appellant was present, but a date was moved for the defence

trial. Hence, further trial was fixed for 27.06.2016. On that it was brought to

the notice of the Court that the Appellant was receiving treatment at Ward

No.60 of the National Hospital of Colombo. On the next day the Appellant

continued to be absent but his surety, his mother was present and informed

that the whereabouts of the Appellant was not known to her and that she

was not in a position to produce him before Court. Hence, an open warrant

CA/HCC/0332/18

5 | P a g e

was issued against the Appellant and the matter was fixed for further trial

on 29.07.2016.

On that day, the Counsel for the Appellant informed the Court that the

Appellant had given written consent which had been received via registered

post, authorizing his Counsel Saliya Peiris, PC and his junior to continue the

case in his absence. This application was refused by the learned High Court

Judge.

Thereafter, evidence under Section 241(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act was led and the case was concluded in his absence.

Background of the case.

On 04.07.2000 around 2.05 p.m., PW4 Senaratna PC/30762 attached to the

Police Narcotics Bureau had received information from his personal informer

that a person from 391 Watta was trafficking Heroin near the Bo-tree at

Thotalanga. Acting on this information, a police party led by PW1

IP/Kumaratunga had gone to the place mentioned in the received

information around 3.10 p.m. At the place the police party had met the

informer and PW1 had directed PW4 and PW3 to accompany the informer to

obtain the identification of the alleged trafficker. All personnel had lingered

near a building and after about 10 minutes the informer had left after

indicating the Appellant to PW4 and PW3 and had. Thereafter, the Appellant

was arrested by PW4 and PW3 and they had called for PW1, who was in the

jeep. PW1 had rushed to the scene and had conducted the search and which

had revealed a cellophane bag with some substance in his right-side trouser

pocket. Upon the substances in the parcel being recovered from the

Appellant reacting for Heroin (diacetylmorphine), he was arrested and

subjected to further investigation. As the investigation revealed that his

house was located 15 to 20 meters away, the police party had gone to the

Appellants house and had done a search but had not been successful in

recovering any more illegal substances.

CA/HCC/0332/18

6 | P a g e

Thereafter, the police party had returned to the bureau, sealed the

production, entered a record under the production register and handed over

the production to PW2 who was the production officer of the bureau.

Thereafter, PW4 was called to give evidence to corroborate the evidence of

PW1 and it was followed by the evidence given by the Government Analyst

and PW9.

The following Grounds of Appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Whether the learned High Court Judge erred in law in refusing the

application made under Section 241(2) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

2. Whether the learned High Court Judge fairly and squarely evaluated

the evidence of the defence.

3. Whether PW1 and PW4 are credible witnesses.

4. Whether the learned High Court Judge by disallowing the Appellant to

be represented and defended by counsel deprived the Appellant of the

benefit of the outcome in CA (PHC) APN 116/2010 and thus permitted

the previous erroneous order pertaining to alibi to remain.

In every criminal case the burden is on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt against the accused person and this burden never

shifts. Hence an accused person has no burden to prove his case unless he

pleads a general or a special exception provided in the Penal Code.

In the case of Mohamed Nimnaz V. Attorney General CA/95/94 held:

A criminal case has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Although

we take serious view in regard to offences in relation to drugs, we are

of the view that the prosecutor should not be given a second chance to

fill the gaps of badly handled prosecutions.

CA/HCC/0332/18

7 | P a g e

In the Attorney-General v. Rawther 25 NLR 385, Ennis, J. states thus:

[1987} 1 SLR 155

"The evidence must establish the guilt of the accused, not his innocence.

His innocence is presumed in law, from the start of the case, and his

guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.

In Miller v. Minister of Pensions (1947) 2 All E.R. 372 the court held that:

the evidence must reach the same degree of cogency as is required in

a criminal case before an accused person is found guilty. That degree is

well settled. It need not reach certainty, but it must carry high degree of

probability. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean proof beyond

the shadow of a doubt. The law would fail to protect the community if it

admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If the

evidence is so strong against a man as to leave only a remote possibility

in his favour which can be dismissed with the sentence, of course it is

possible, but not in the least probable, the case is proved beyond

reasonable doubt, but nothing short of that will suffice.

In the first ground of appeal the learned Presidents Counsel contended that

refusing an application made under Section 241(2) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act is wrong and the Appellant is deprived a statutory right,

thereby denied a fair trial.

Section 241(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states:

The commencement or continuation of a trial under this section, shall

not be deed or construed to affect or prejudice the right of such person

to be defended by an attorney-at-law at such trial.

In Mohamed Buhary Mohamed Asmin v Attorney General CA/240/2010

decided on 09.10.2014 the Court held that:

As per Section 241 (2) of the Code, it is very clear that the commencement

or continuance of the trial under this Section shall not be deemed or

CA/HCC/0332/18

8 | P a g e

constitute to affect or prejudice the right of such person to be defended by

an attorney at law, at the 'trial.

This court observes that, to be defended by an Attorney-at-law is a

fundamental right which cannot be denied to an accused party.

In Thilakaratne v Attorney General [1989] 2 SLR 191 the Court held that:

Section 241(2) does not make it obligatory for court to assign a counsel to

defend an absent accused. This subsection applies to a case where an

absent accused or someone on his behalf retains a counsel to defend him

in absentia, or to a case where, a counsel (assigned or retained) is

defending an accused who absconds during the course of the trial.

Considering the above judgments, it is crystal clear that the learned High

Court Judge who made the refusal order had erred in law and caused great

prejudice to the Appellant. Further, whatever the justification given

regarding Section 241(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act, refusal of an

appeal by the learned High Court Judge who wrote the judgement is totally

unreasonable and he had overlooked the fundamental rights guaranteed

under Article 13(3) of the Constitution. This has caused another serious

procedural mishap in this case.

In the second ground of appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel contended

that the learned High Court Judge had not fairly and squarely evaluated the

evidence of the defence.

Each accused is entitled to public, fair proceedings conducted impartially

and in full equality. A strong defence is a vital component of a fair trial. The

defence Counsel represent and protect the rights of the accused. All accused

persons are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt

before the Court. Evidence plays a crucial role in proving or disproving an

accuseds guilt and building a solid defence. As the admissibility of the

evidence is a critical factor, each piece of evidence must be carefully

examined and evaluated for its admissibility and relevance to the case.

CA/HCC/0332/18

9 | P a g e

The learned Presidents Counsel highlighting the following points, contended

that the learned High Court Judge had not evaluated and analysed the

defence in his judgment. The points are set out below:

That PW4 had arrested the Appellant in February few months prior to

the impugned raid.

That during said arrest the Appellant was severely beaten by the police

and he was treated at the National Hospital Colombo.

That on the day of the incident on 04.07.2000 the Appellant was

arrested at his home while he was having his lunch and the Appellant

was wearing a sarong? at the time of the arrest.

That nothing illegal was found in the possession of the Appellant at

the time of his arrest.

That the Appellants brother gave evidence in the bribery case bearing

No. 1156/96 against few higher-ranking police officers.

The learned High Court Judge who wrote the judgment only benefited of

hearing the submission of the prosecution. Further, he has not participated

in conducting the trial except for conducting an inquiry under Section 241(1)

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to conclude the matter.

In Martin v Queen 69 CLW 21 T.S Fernando, J. held that:

Even if the jury declined to believe the Appellants version, he was yet

entitled to acquit on the charge if his version raised in the mind of the

jury a reasonable doubt as to the truth of the prosecutions case.

The learned High Court Judge who wrote the judgement had concluded that

the defence taken up by the Appellant would not succeed. He had reached

this conclusion only considering the evidence given by PW1 and PW2.

Further it consisted with his opinion. Further he had not given proper

reasoning for the rejection of documents marked as V1 to V5 by the defence.

The relevant portion of the judgment is re-produced below:

In my view this has caused grave prejudiced but has also denied a fair trial

to the Appellant.

In the third ground of appeal the learned Presidents Counsel contended that

PW1 and PW4 are not credible witnesses.

In Kumara De Silva v The Attorney General [2010] 2 SRI LR. 169 the Court

held that:

(1) Credibility is a question of fact, not of law. The acceptance or

rejection of evidence of witnesses is therefore a question of fact for the

trial Judge.

A prosecutions case depends on the evidence they adduce against an

Accused person. And that evidence, in one way or another, comes from

witnesses. Witnesses are people who saw an Accused commit the crime or

get caught while the offence is being committed.

Witnesses testify to what they saw or detected. Just because a witness says

something happened it does not mean a judge or jury needs to believe their

testimony. Not all witnesses are credible. If a witness is not credible, his or

her testimony is not credible. To accuse someone "beyond reasonable doubt,"

it is essential to possess substantial evidence.

Learned Presidents Counsel contended that PW1 and PW4 had deliberately

uttered lies against the Appellant, and that the infirmities in the evidence of

CA/HCC/0332/18

11 | P a g e

these two witnesses go to the root of the case and thereby create a reasonable

doubt on the prosecution case.

The evidence of PW1 revealed that the Appellant was arrested at 3.25 p.m.

for the possession of 8.8 grams of Heroin. The charge was explained to the

Appellant when he was arrested at the place of arrest. In the cross

examination, PW1 admitted that he weighed the substance at the Police

Narcotics Bureau. The question arises as to how PW1 charged the Appellant

for possession of 8.8 grams of Heroin before it was weighed. The said portion

of proceeding is re-produced below:

According to PW1 and PW4 the Appellant was arrested near a building. But

the defense suggested that he was arrested at his residence. An unusual

entry had been made by PW1 before he left the Bureau. It states that:

wka;rdodhl T!IO mkf;a 77 (ii) j.ka;sh hgf;a n,h mjrdf.k l%shd lr'

As the raid was in consequence of an information received by PW4, there was

no necessity to obtain a search warrant to conduct the raid. When PW1 was

cross examined on this point he could not give a reasonable explanation and

admitted that in a situation of this nature adherence to Section 77(ii) of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance is not necessary. The

relevant portion of the proceeding is re-produced below:

Considering above mentioned infirmities of the evidence of PW1, it certainly

affects the credibility and trustworthiness of the witness and conducting the

raid in a manner as explained by the prosecution depicts incompetence on

the part of the policemen involved.

A witness who is believed to be credible and trustworthy can add great value

to their testimony in the eyes of both the judge and the jury. A witness can

be deemed to be credible based on his knowledge, experience, training and

also on the appearance of trustworthiness. Similarly, a witness who seems

to be untrustworthy, while unlikely to help a case, could actually end up

harming it.

CA/HCC/0332/18

13 | P a g e

In the final ground of appeal, the learned Presidents Counsel contended that

by disallowing the Appellant to be represented and defended by a counsel,

the learned High Court Judge deprived the Appellant of the benefit of the

outcome in CA (PHC) APN 116/2010 and thus permitted the previous

erroneous order pertaining to alibi to remain.

In this case two erroneous orders of the learned High Court Judge had

caused great prejudice to the Appellant. The first erroneous order was

rectified by this Court under case No. CA/PHC/APN 116/2010. But the

Appellant was deprived of the representation of a Counsel in his absence

which had not only caused great prejudice to the Appellant but had also

denied him a fair trial.

To determine whether an accused is innocent or guilty, the concept of fair

trial plays a vital role. A fair trial is a universally recognised human right.

Fair trials help establish the truth and are vital for everyone involved in a

case. It is a cornerstone of democracy, helping to ensure fair and just

societies.

Guided by the above cited judicial decisions, I conclude that the appeal

grounds advanced by the Appellant has a very serious impact on the

prosecution case.

Now I consider whether this is an appropriate case to be sent for a re-trial. A

re-trial is a second (or further) trial on the same issues with the same parties.

It is not treated as an extension of the first trial, as new evidence can be

called.

In this case the date of offence is 04.07.2000. The prosecution witnesses and

the defence had given evidence twice. Further, more than 24 years had

passed since the alleged incident. Therefore, this is not an appropriate case

to send for re-trial.

CA/HCC/0332/18

14 | P a g e

In this case I am of the view that the defence evidence is more than sufficient

to create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. As the evidence

presented by the Appellant creates a reasonable doubt over the prosecution

case, I set aside the conviction and sentence imposed by the learned High

Court Judge of Colombo dated 31.08.2018 on the Appellant. Therefore, The

Appellant is acquitted from both charges.

Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this judgment to the High

Court of Colombo along with the original case record.
