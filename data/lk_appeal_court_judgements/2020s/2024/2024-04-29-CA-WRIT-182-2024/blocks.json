    "text": "2 However Laker Airways decision of the House has been criticized by some text writers. It appears that the Court of Appeal judgment of Denning M. R. is the sounder one. Further Harry Woolf was the junior treasury counsel in the original case Laker Airways Ltd., vs. Department of Trade [1977] Q. B. 643. The other airlines who objected to the new idea of Sir Freddie Laker, who started Laker Airways in 1966, to have what was called a sky train between England and the United States, which enabled passengers to go to an Air Port and buy a ticket and board a plane, without the hazel of bookings through Travel Agents etc., or even directly from the airline, having waited for a considerable time; and if not paying an exorbitant sum to reserve a seat, which could have started in 1973 or a half a century ago, instituted cases against Laker Airways. Some of them were BRITISH AIRWAYS BOARD v. LAKER AIRWAYS LTD. AND OTHERS [1983 B. No. 342] and BRITISH CALEDONIAN AIRWAYS LTD. v. LAKER AIRWAYS LTD. AND OTHERS [1983 B. No. 377]. It is said, that, At the hearing of their appeals British Airways and British Caledonia relied upon the Order and directions by the Secretary of State under the Act of 1980. Lakers stated that they wished to challenge the validity of the Order and directions and applied to Woolf J. for leave to apply for judicial review. The refusal of such leave was followed by a renewal of the application to the Court of Appeal which was heard concurrently with B.A.'s and B.C.'s appeals. [This quotation is from the above two cases reported at [1984] Q. B. 142 at page 143. Sir Stephen Sedley, in his lecture, The Lion Beneath the Throne: Law as History, said, Lord Woolf in his 1989 Hamlyn Lectures noted without rancour that the string of celebrated public law cases which he lost as Treasury counsel over little more than a year Tameside, Congreve, The Crossman Diaries and Laker Airways - had (in his words) all contributed to the development of administrative law. Harry Woolf is presently the chief editor of De Smiths Judicial Review 7th edition. [See., The Caucasian Chalk Circle (1944) by Bertolt Brecht Digitalized by RevSocialist for SocialistStories, Chapter 5 The Story of the Judge]. In the three cases, Congreve, Laker Airways and Tameside the courts granted relief, although in Laker Airways the subsequent litigation stultified the effect of Lord Dennings decision in the Court of Appeal, as a result of which if one makes a search in the internet today (in 2023) on the keyword Sky Train, it shows a medium-capacity rapid transit system serving the Metro Vancouver region in British Columbia, Canada and such other rails fixed on bridges and a reference to Laker Airways the institution founded by Sir Freddie Laker in 1966 and its demise due to transatlantic monopoly of United States foreign trade (as alleged by Laker) reported as out of court settlements. Hence the institution founded by Sir Freddie Laker in 1966 and its demise due to transatlantic monopoly of United States foreign trade (as alleged by Laker) prevented the traveler by air of the convenience of the sky train system; and there was no other Freddie Laker born in this world for the next fifty years. This is an example of monopoly affecting the consumer.",
