D.N. Samarakoon, J

The petitioners are LAUGFS GAS PLC and W. K. H. Wegapitiya, who is its Chairman.

The written submissions of the petitioner dated 04.04.2024 says, that, following

questions need not be, not necessary to be and or cannot be considered at this

stage,

(i) Facts because the court satisfied on a prima facie basis issued notice

on the respondents

(ii) Whether clause 4.5(a) of P.16 is reasonable

(iii) Whether paragraphs 4 and 5 in section B of Annexure 4 [P.16] is

reasonable

(iv) Whether the principle of anti monopoly is a part of the Law of Sri Lanka

and / or is reasonable

Items (ii) to (iv) are mentioned at paragraph 26 of the above written

submissions.

Nevertheless, the petitioners say, at paragraph 31, that, in any event and without

prejudice, what is sought to be attacked in this case is Clause 4.5(a) and

paragraphs 4 and 5 in section B of Annexure 4 of the P.16.

Clause 4.5(a) of the Bid Document, as reproduced by the petitioners at

paragraph 49 of their written submissions reads thus,

Clause 4.5(a) of the Bid Document dated 16th January 2024 -

A Prospective Bidder may be disqualified from the Bidding Process and

excluded from further consideration for the following reasons in GoSL 's

opinion:

The Prospective Bidder (in case of a Consortium, and Consortium Member)

or its Connected Party is operating in the same sector as the Company in

Sri Lanka and in the event such Prospective Bidder is the Successful

Bidder, the Post Divestiture Market Share would be 50% (fifty percent) or

more. It is hereby clarified that the above threshold of Post Divestiture

Market Share shall be calculated only for such Prospective Bidders (in case

of a Consortium, and Consortium Member) or its Connected Party that

operates in the LPG sector in Sri Lanka. It is the policy of the GoSL to

promote contestable markets and in a similar way it will apply to the LPG

market in Sri Lanka.

Paragraphs 4 and 5 in section B of Annexture 4 of the Bid Document reads thus,

4. A Prospective Bidder must: have a minimum Net Worth of at least

USD 100,000,000 (United States Dollars one hundred million) or its

equivalent. Such Net Worth should be calculated based on its latest

audited financial statements which must be dated not earlier than 31

December 2022 or the last day of the entity's fiscal year, whichever is later.

5. If the Prospective Bidder, is a Consortium, the combined Net Worth of

the Consortium Members must be USD 100,000,000 (United States

Dollars one hundred million), measured by each Consortium Member's Net

Worth in proportion to their proposed shareholding in the Consortium. For

avoidance of doubt, this means that if a Consortium Member has 25%

(twenty five percent) shareholdings in the Consortium, such Consortium

Member must have a minimum Net Worth of USD 25,000,000 (United

States Dollars twenty five million).

Where the Net Worth is expressed in a currency other than USD, the

Prospective Bidders are required to demonstrate its Net Worth by taking

the equivalent USD amount at the exchange rate published by the Federal

Reserve Board as on the date considered for Net Worth.

A Prospective Bidder must provide evidence that it has the Net Worth of at

least USD 100,000,000 (United States Dolars one hundred million) or its

equivalent for the Proposed Transaction. Such evidence shall be in the

They state in written submissions filed on their behalf dated 04.04.2024, among

other things, that,

(a) The Petitioner after having submitted their bid, cannot now

challenge a particular clause of the tender document as they are now

bound by the clauses of the tender documents.

8. If the Petitioners were of the position that clause 4.5(a) was ultra

vires/unreasonable, the Petitioner ought to have then challenged the said

clause at their earliest opportunity when they first got to know about the

said clause. This was on 16.01.2024 as evident on the face of P 16.

However, without doing so, the Petitioners tendered their bid.

9. The mere submission of the bid alone estops the Petitioner by their

own conduct from challenging the terms of the Bid. By submitting an

expression of Interest the Petitioners have implicitly accepted that

all terms and conditions of the document marked P.16 would form

the basis of selection . .1

What does Sir William Wade say about this kind of estopple in his

Administrative Law, 12th Edition?

A. ESTOPPEL: BASIC PRINCIPLES

The basic principle of estoppel is that a person who by some statement or

representation of fact causes another to act to their detriment (Norfolk CC

vs. Secretary of state for the Environment [1973] 1 W. L. R. 1400) in reliance

on the truth of it is not allowed to deny it later, even though it is wrong.

Justice here prevails over truth. Estoppel is often described as a rule of

evidence, but more correctly it is a principle of law. (Canada & Dominion

Sugar Co Ltd vs. Canadian National (West Indies) Steamships Ltd [1947] A.

C. 46 at 56). As a principle of common law it applies only to representations

about past or present facts. But there is also an equitable principle of

'promissory estoppel' which can apply to public authorities. (Robertson vs.

Minister of Pensions [1949] 1 K. B. 227). In a class by itself is estoppel by

judgment, res judicata, discussed below. (below page 201). This last is also

known as issue estoppel, since it is a rule against the relitigation of the

same issue between the same parties. [page 277]

In the present case, the petitioner says, that, clause 4.5(a) is unreasonable. So

that clause is then for the detriment of the petitioner. But the petitioner without

challenging the same tendered its bid. It is a little different to what was discussed

in the above passage in mechanism. But the principle is similar. By tendering a

bid, knowing about the existence of clause 4.5(a), the petitioners represent to the

1 [The dots appear in the above written submissions. As paragraph 9 is not a passage quoted from elsewhere it appears that the dots serve no purpose. But they are reproduced here in quoting paragraph 9 verbatim].

8 | C . A . W r i t 1 8 2 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n t h e q u e s t i o n o f g r a n t i n g i n t e r i m r e l i e f J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

maker of that clause that the petitioners have no grouse about the same. Hence

it appears that they cannot do so later.

Wade continues,

Legal rules about estoppel and waiver sometimes seem to be applicable

to public authorities in the same way that they apply to persons. [page

277]

So the emphasis of Wade here is to instances where a public authority, a country

council or a city corporation, etc., is estopped. But his above words, that,

.seem to be applicable to public authorities in the same way that they apply

to persons, makes it clear, that, the same principle applies in reverse to a

person, such as the 01st and or the 02nd petitioner too.

The learned author continues,

A city corporation may be estopped from denying that payments made to

it in satisfaction of a liability for rates are 'rates actually levied', (North

Western Gas Board vs. Manchester Corporation [1964] 1 WLR 64) and a

county council may, by giving an employee a certain status for

superannuation, estop itself from denying that status later. (Algar vs.

Middlesex County Council [1945] 2 All E R 243). Similarly a public authority

which lets land on lease is bound by the usual rule that acceptance of rent

with knowledge of a breach of covenant by the tenant amounts to waiver

of the lessor's right of forfeiture for the breach. (Davenport vs. Rex (1887)

3 App Cas 115). A local authority which agrees that a landowner may have

access to a road from a particular plot may not, after the owner has fenced

the plot and agreed to sell it, revoke the permission given. (Crabb vs. Arun

DC [1976] Ch. 179). If they negotiate the purchase of land for road widening

and encourage the owner to incur expenditure on an alternative site, they

may not then discontinue the purchase. (Salvation Army Trustee Co vs.

West Yorkshire CC (1980) 41 P & CR 179). [page 277]

But, just as with contracts, the ordinary rules must give way where their

application becomes incompatible with the free and proper exercise of an

authority's powers or the due performance of its duties in the public

interest. Where the normal principles of justice are forced to give way, hard

cases naturally result. As discussed below, it is possible for a citizen to be

seriously misled by a public authority in a manner which ought, under the

normal rules, to give rise to an estoppel which would compel the authority

to stand by its representations; but there may be no legal remedy. [page

277]

It is not the position of the petitioners that they tendered the bid having been

misled about the scope of clause 4.5(a) but later realized its import. It is plain

and straightforward as to what it says.

The position of the petitioners is that the clause 4.5(a) is unreasonable. Hence it

is pertinent to consider what Wade says next about estoppel and ultra vires,

because whether alleged or not ultra vires could be a cause for unreasonability.

B. ESTOPPEL AND ULTRA VIRES

In public law the most obvious limitation on the doctrine of estoppel is

that it cannot be invoked so as to give an authority powers which it does

not in law possess. In other words, no estoppel can legitimate action

which is ultra vires. Thus, where an electricity authority, by misreading

a meter, undercharged its customer for two years, it was held that the

accounts it delivered did not estop it from demanding payment in full,

(Maritime Electric Company vs. General Diaries Ltd [1937] A. C. 610) for the

authority had a statutory duty to collect the full amount, and had no power

to release the customer, expressly or otherwise. Where a minister took

possession of land under statutory powers of occupation which did not

extend to the grant of leases, he was not estopped from denying that he

had granted a lease, even though he had expressly purported to 'let' the

10 | C . A . W r i t 1 8 2 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n t h e q u e s t i o n o f g r a n t i n g i n t e r i m r e l i e f J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

land to a 'tenant. (Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries vs. Matthews [1950]

1 K. B. 148). The result was the same where the supposed landlord was a

local authority which had failed to obtain the requisite consent from the

minister, so that the lease was void. Accordingly, the local authority was

at liberty to deny the validity of their own 'lease', contrary to the rules

which govern private lettings. (Rhyl UDC vs. Rhyl Amusements Ltd [1959]

1 W. L. R. 465). No arrangement between the parties could prevent either

of them from asserting the fact that the lease was ultra vires and void. Nor

can any kind of estoppel give a tribunal wider jurisdiction than it

possesses. (Secretary of state for employment vs. Globe Electric Thread Co

Ltd [1980] A. C. 506). [Emphasis added in this order]. [page 278]

The rules embodied in the above passage are,

(i) Estoppel does not permit a public body to bind a person on what is ultra

vires and if that is ultra vires the person who acts on it will not be

prevented from resiling from what he represented based on that clause,

etc.,

(ii) If the promise extended by the public authority to a person is ultra

vires, then, the public authority also is not bound from the same

In both (i) and (ii) it appears that the promise, clause, condition etc., becomes

a nullity.

Wade continues,

Similarly, the principle of estoppel cannot prevent a change of government

policy. A government department which encourages an airline to invest in

aircraft on the understanding that its licence will be continued is not

estopped, if there is a change of government and a reversal of policy, from

withdrawing the licence. (Laker Airways Limited vs. Department of Trade

11 | C . A . W r i t 1 8 2 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n t h e q u e s t i o n o f g r a n t i n g i n t e r i m r e l i e f J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

[1977] Q. B. 6432). Many people may be victims of political vicissitudes,

and 'estoppel cannot be allowed to hinder the formation of government

policy'.

Estoppels have, however, been allowed to operate against public

authorities in minor matters of formality, where no question of ultra vires

arises. In one case Lord Denning MR said: (Wells vs. Minister of Housing

and Local Government [1967] 1 W. L. R. 465).

2 However Laker Airways decision of the House has been criticized by some text writers. It appears that the Court of Appeal judgment of Denning M. R. is the sounder one. Further Harry Woolf was the junior treasury counsel in the original case Laker Airways Ltd., vs. Department of Trade [1977] Q. B. 643. The other airlines who objected to the new idea of Sir Freddie Laker, who started Laker Airways in 1966, to have what was called a sky train between England and the United States, which enabled passengers to go to an Air Port and buy a ticket and board a plane, without the hazel of bookings through Travel Agents etc., or even directly from the airline, having waited for a considerable time; and if not paying an exorbitant sum to reserve a seat, which could have started in 1973 or a half a century ago, instituted cases against Laker Airways. Some of them were BRITISH AIRWAYS BOARD v. LAKER AIRWAYS LTD. AND OTHERS [1983 B. No. 342] and BRITISH CALEDONIAN AIRWAYS LTD. v. LAKER AIRWAYS LTD. AND OTHERS [1983 B. No. 377]. It is said, that, At the hearing of their appeals British Airways and British Caledonia relied upon the Order and directions by the Secretary of State under the Act of 1980. Lakers stated that they wished to challenge the validity of the Order and directions and applied to Woolf J. for leave to apply for judicial review. The refusal of such leave was followed by a renewal of the application to the Court of Appeal which was heard concurrently with B.A.'s and B.C.'s appeals. [This quotation is from the above two cases reported at [1984] Q. B. 142 at page 143. Sir Stephen Sedley, in his lecture, The Lion Beneath the Throne: Law as History, said, Lord Woolf in his 1989 Hamlyn Lectures noted without rancour that the string of celebrated public law cases which he lost as Treasury counsel over little more than a year Tameside, Congreve, The Crossman Diaries and Laker Airways - had (in his words) all contributed to the development of administrative law. Harry Woolf is presently the chief editor of De Smiths Judicial Review 7th edition. [See., The Caucasian Chalk Circle (1944) by Bertolt Brecht Digitalized by RevSocialist for SocialistStories, Chapter 5 The Story of the Judge]. In the three cases, Congreve, Laker Airways and Tameside the courts granted relief, although in Laker Airways the subsequent litigation stultified the effect of Lord Dennings decision in the Court of Appeal, as a result of which if one makes a search in the internet today (in 2023) on the keyword Sky Train, it shows a medium-capacity rapid transit system serving the Metro Vancouver region in British Columbia, Canada and such other rails fixed on bridges and a reference to Laker Airways the institution founded by Sir Freddie Laker in 1966 and its demise due to transatlantic monopoly of United States foreign trade (as alleged by Laker) reported as out of court settlements. Hence the institution founded by Sir Freddie Laker in 1966 and its demise due to transatlantic monopoly of United States foreign trade (as alleged by Laker) prevented the traveler by air of the convenience of the sky train system; and there was no other Freddie Laker born in this world for the next fifty years. This is an example of monopoly affecting the consumer.

Now I know that a public authority cannot be estopped from doing

its public duty, but I do think it can be estopped from relying on

technicalities.

He then held that the court could ignore the fact that the proper statutory

application had not been made before a planning authority's

determination, since the authority itself had led the landowner to suppose

that it was not required; and the authority was therefore estopped from

taking the objection. The same doctrine was applied in a case where a

mother was out of time in lodging a statutory notice of objection to a local

authority's order assuming parental rights over her child; the authority

was estopped from insisting on the time limit because its officers had

misled the mother into supposing that a previous notice of objection was

still effective. (Re L (AC) (an infant) [1971] 3 All E R 743). Where a public

authority abuses its powers, a strong obiter dictum in the House of Lords

holds that it may be estopped. (Regina (Anufrijeva) vs. Home Secretary

[2003] UKHL 36). [page 278,279]

If the position of the petitioners that clause 4.5(a) is unreasonable is correct,

then, most probably it resulted from an abuse of power by its maker. But here

the situation becomes different, because, the petitioners acquiesced with it.

Hence it is pertinent to consider what Wade says on Waiver and Consent.

7. WAIVER AND CONSENT

A PRIMARY RULES

Waiver and consent are in their effects closely akin to estoppel, and not

always clearly distinguishable from it. But no rigid distinction need be

made, since for present purposes the law is similar (But note the distinction

drawn in R (Hill) vs. Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and

Wales [2013] EWCA Civ 555, a natural justice case discussed morefully

13 | C . A . W r i t 1 8 2 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n t h e q u e s t i o n o f g r a n t i n g i n t e r i m r e l i e f J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

above page 223, between a particular procedure which is not a breach of

natural justice because all parties have consented in advance and a breach

of natural justice which is waived). The primary rule is that no waiver of

rights and no consent or private bargain can give a public authority more

power than it legitimately possesses. Once again, the principle of ultra

vires must prevail when it comes into conflict with the ordinary rules of

law (Previous two sentences approved in Cropp vs. A Judicial Committee

[2008] NZSC 46). A contrasting rule is that a public authority which has

made some order regulation is not normally at liberty to waive the

observance of it by exercising a dispensing power. The principle here is

that law which exists for the general public benefit may not be waived with

the same freedom as the rights of a private person. In other cases, where

neither of these rules is infringed, waiver and consent may operate in a

normal way so as to modify rights and duties.

ln one case a tenant had applied to a rent tribunal and obtained an order

substantially reducing his rent, but later discovered that the house had

been let at a date which put it outside the tribunal's jurisdiction. He then

applied to the county court, which in that case would have jurisdiction.

The High Court granted mandamus to compel the county court to decide

the case, despite the fact that both parties had previously acquiesced in

the rent tribunal's order. (Regina vs. Judge Pugh ex p Graham [1951] 2 K

B 623). The issue was one of jurisdictional fact and the court before which

it was raised was obliged to determine it. In a planning case concerning a

caravan site, the Court of Appeal held that the site-owner could apply for

a declaration that the planning authority's enforcement notice was bad in

law, even though he had pleaded guilty to contravention of the notice in

previous criminal proceedings (Munnich vs. Goldstone Rural District

Council [1966] 1 WLR 427). If the notice was in reality bad, no previous

acquiescence could preclude him from contesting it. Exactly the same

14 | C . A . W r i t 1 8 2 2 0 2 4 O r d e r o n t h e q u e s t i o n o f g r a n t i n g i n t e r i m r e l i e f J u s t i c e D u s h m a n t a N . S a m a r a k o o n 2 9 t h A p r i l 2 0 2 4

point determined an earlier enforcement notice case in which the

landowners on whom the notice had been served applied for planning

permission on the footing that the notice was valid. They were held

entitled, nevertheless, to dispute its validity subsequently. (Swallow &

Pearson vs. Middlesex County Council [1953] 1 WLR 422). The House of

Lords confirmed this principle in a case where a party had acquiesced in

proceedings before the Lands Tribunal which were later held to be outside

that tribunal's jurisdiction. Lord Reid said: 'in my judgment, it is a

fundamental principle that no consent can confer on a court or tribunal

with limited statutory jurisdiction any power to act beyond that

jurisdiction, or can estop the consenting party from subsequently

maintaining that such court or tribunal has acted without jurisdiction

(Essex Incorporated Congregational Church Union vs. Essex County Council

[1963] A. C. 808; London Cpn vs. Cox (1867) L R 2 H L 239 at 283; Bradford

City M C vs. Secretary of State for the Environment (1986) 53 P & C R 55).

It follows that resort to a statutory remedy cannot be a waiver of the right

to seek judicial review later. (See below, page 601).

Therefore if clause 4.5(a) is unreasonable and if that resulted from the powers

of the authority that made it, then acquiescence to it does not bind the

petitioner.

But can clause 4.5(a) be ultra vires or otherwise unreasonable or

disproportionate?

It is pertinent to consider the report titled TOWARDS A NEW COMPETITION

LAW IN SRI LANKA 2002 with a foreword by Dr. Saman Kelegama, Institute of

Policy Studies and preface by Ms. Damaris Wickremesekera, Law & Society

Trust.

The report says,

There is also a growing realisation that mutually supportive trade and

competition policies can contribute to sound economic development and

that effective competition policies help to ensure that the benefits of

liberalisation and market-based reforms flow through to all citizens.

The benefits of competition policy, including greater social welfare, as well

as enhanced producer efficiency, were essential elements in selling this

concept to the developing nations. However, the impact of the introduction

of such policies, or, elements of such policies, among the developing

nations has not been significant3.

(from the foreword)

It also says,

This is the Sri Lanka country report, which will feed into the first phase

of the Comparative Study of Competition Law Regimes of Select Developing

Countries of the Commonwealth, also known as the 7-Up Project,

undertaken by the Consumer Unity & Trust Society (CUTS) with the

support of the Department for International Development, UK. The Sri

Lanka component of study is being jointly conducted by the Institute of

The motivation behind the project was increasing international

concern with regard to anti- competitive practices, and the need to

put in place an appropriate legal framework to deal with such

practices. The research project is a comparative study of the competition

regimes of seven developing countries in the Commonwealth. It aims to

identify measures that would assist developing countries in strengthening

their competition laws and introducing such laws where they are absent.

Beside Sri Lanka the other countries in which the study has been

undertaken are India, Kenya, Pakistan, South Africa, Tanzania and

Zambia.

The proposal for a new Consumer Protection Authority in Sri Lanka, which

is still awaiting parliamentary approval, would replace the Fair Trading

Commission Act of 1987 and the Consumer Protection Act of 1979. This

represents the first attempt to combine consumer protection with market

regulation of international trade, and will replace the existing Fair Trading

Commission and the Department for International Trade with a single

body. However, given the absence of a co-ordinated approach to the

promotion of competition in Sri Lanka, and the gaps in the proposed bill,

the need for analysis of competition policy is still great.

It is most timely in the light of current developments in competition

policy in Sri Lanka, and the need to encourage consumer

organisations to engage in their activities with renewed strength. The

Institute of Policy Studies and the Law & Society Trust are happy to be

involved in this project and would like to thank Thushari de Zoysa and

Pubudini Wickramaratne Rupesinghe for their hard work in preparing this

country Report.

(from the preface) [Emphasis added in this order].

Therefore, at least, from as far back as 2002 [and undoubtedly prior to that too]

the policy of the government was to encourage competition and to prevent anti

competitive practices.

The above report refers to

(i) A Competition Protection Authority

(ii) A Competition Protection Council and

(iii) Consumer Protection Act and 1979 Consumer Protection Act (1979)

As the preface said, at the time of this report the 2003 (present) Consumer Affairs

Authority Act No. 9 of 2003 was in the process of being enacted.

The said Act of 2003 says in its sections 34 and 35 as follows,

PART III

PROMOTION OF COMPETITION AND CONSUMER INTEREST

Authority to carry out investigation into anti-competitive practices.

34. (1) The Authority may either of its own motion or on a complaint or

request made to it by any person, any organization of consumers or an

association of traders, carry out an investigation with respect to the

prevalence of any anticompetitive practice.

(2) It shall be the duty of the Authority to complete an investigation under

subsection (1), within one hundred days of its initiation.

Anti-competitive practice.

35. For the purpose of section 34, an anti-competitive practice shall be

deemed to prevail, where a person in the course of business, pursues a

course of conduct which of itself or when taken together with a course of

conduct pursued by persons associated with him, has or is intended to

have or is likely to have the effect of restricting, distorting or preventing

competition in connection with the production, supply or acquisition of

goods in Sri Lanka or the supply or securing of services in Sri Lanka.

Hence it is clear, that, clause 4.5(a) has come to the relevant document on the

basis of the government policy of preventing anti competitive practices and

promoting competition.

The next question is whether, the court, in judicial review can question the

Ministerial policy or planning policy.

A case to be considered is Save Britains Heritage vs. Number 1 Poultry Ltd.

[1991] 1 WLR 153 decided in the House of Lords.

Lord Bridge of Harwich said,

Perhaps the central issue in the appeal is the issue relating to planning

policy. (page 168)

In this case, the application of the owners to demolish certain property in the

city of London and to rebuild a new structure was rejected by the Secretary of

State in 1985, who had to consider, among other things, whether the building

should be one that should be preserved. They were called listed buildings and

the building in question was listed as Grade II G. V. or Group Value, the value

of the building derived by its position in a group of buildings.

Here the local planning authority refused the application of the owners and

when they appealed to the Secretary of State [on a subsequent occasion] the

Secretary of State accepting his inspectors recommendations held that the

architectural merits of the proposed replacement building were such as to

override his stated policy, set out in paragraph 89 of D. O. E. Circular 8/87,

that listed buildings capable of economic use should not be demolished. An

objector to the proposed redevelopment sought under section 245 of the Town

and Country Planning Act of 1971 to quash the Secretary of States decision on

the ground that he had failed to give sufficient reasons for his decision as

required by rule 17(1) of the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure)

Rules 1988 and failed to had regard to, or misdirected himself as to the effect

of, his policy relating to consent for demolition of listed buildings. The

Divisional Court dismissed that application, but the Court of Appeal, including

Woolf J., quashed the Secretary of States decision. On appeal to the House the

appeal was allowed.

In this case, on analogy, the clause 4.5(a) represents the policy of the state.

Lord Bridge of Harwich said,

The true gravamen of Saves complaint in relation to the policy issue is

that by his decision in this case the Secretary of State has sanctioned a

departure from the declared policy in Circular 8/87 without specifying in

terms the limits of the exception to the general rule that a listed building

may never be demolished to make way for other development if it is still

capable of economic use and has thereby set a dangerous precedent for

the future. Even if Circular 8/87 laid down such a general rule as

admitting of no exceptions, which, as already indicated, I do not accept, it

was clearly open to the Secretary of State to make an exception, the

decision letter of May 1985 foreshadowed such an exception and the

present decision treated the circumstances as justifying such an

exception. (page 170)

Another case decided in the House of Lords which was on planning policy was

London Residuary Body vs. Lambeth London Borough Council [1990] 1

WLR 744.

When the Greater London Council was abolished in 1986, County Hall on the

South bank of the Thames became vested in the London Residuary Body which

applied for planning permission to use the main block for mixed hotel,

residential and general office purposes unconnected with any local government

functions, After the inquiry, the Secretary of State disagreed with his inspector

and decided that these general office purposes should be permitted. The Court

of Appeal held that this decision should be quashed because the minister

had not applied the correct test of competing needs, in this case between

those of local government and those of other office users. But the Law

Lords unanimously decided that he was obliged to have regard only to

material considerations and that the amount of weight to be given to

these was a matter for his judgment.

Lord Templeman said,

In the present case, the inspector who recommends, took one view and

the Secretary of State who decides, took the opposite view. Subsequently,

I. L. E. A. which was the only organization worth considering, disappeared

from County Hall and from existence. By the Act of 1985, Parliament

decided to change the organization of the local government of Greater

London in a way which, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, made

County Hall redundant for local government purposes. It is not for the

court to question the wisdom of Parliament. It is not for the court to order

that the main building shall have a splendid future as the home of local

government and that the owners from time to time of the main building

shall be compelled to let the premises to local government authorities and

no one else and to suffer offices to be occupied by public typists to the

exclusion of private typists. Consistently with the Act of 1985, the abolition

of G. L. C. and the abolition of I. L. E. A. and the dispersion of their

functions, the L. R. B. has secured and the Secretary of State has

approved, that the main building shall have no future as the home of local

government. That is a political decision and the planning decision

follows inexorably (page 755)

In regard to the statement in the above passage, It is not for the court to

question the wisdom of Parliament, it is true that because of the presence of

Article 80(3) of the Constitution, the courts in this country cannot do so. But it

is the court and no other, that interpret the law. As Chief Justice John Marshall

said in William Marbury vs. James Madison, It is the duty of the judiciary

department to say what the law is.

However, in this case it does not appear, at least at this stage, to this Court that

clause 4.5(a) is ultra vires, or come under any other disqualification such as

unreasonableness, irrationality or disproportionality, etc., which come within

the scope of administrative law. Furthermore, this is not to say, that, the court

in judicial review can never question state policy. In the case of Council of Civil

Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service [1985] AC 374, commonly

known as the GCHQ case, the House of Lords ruled that the government acted

unlawfully when it used the royal prerogative to ban trade union membership at

the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ). The court held that the

decision was subject to judicial review and that the government could not use

prerogative powers to bypass Parliament in matters affecting individual rights.

This case marked a significant development in administrative law by establishing

the principle that prerogative powers are reviewable by the courts. If the

prerogative is subject to judicial review it must naturally follow, that, state policy

too is so. But what this Court sees, in respect of clause 4.5(a) is that, if at all, it

is for the benefit of the public, whose natural liberty is the basis and source of,

not only the public law, but all law.

Hence this Court is not inclined to grant interim orders prayed for.

There is no order on costs.
