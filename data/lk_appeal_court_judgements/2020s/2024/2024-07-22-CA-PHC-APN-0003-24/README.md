JUDGMENT

P.Kumararatnam,J.

The 7th Accused-Petitioner (Hereinafter referred to as the Petitioner) is

the 7th Accused named in the indictment bearing No. CR1 2459/19

pending before the High Court of Balapitiya. The indictment was served

on him on 18.02.2020 and was released on the High Court bail twice.

The Petitioner had appeared in Court on all relevant dates but failed to

appear on the occasions where he was remanded pertaining to other

alleged criminal offences.

When he was brought to Court by the Prison Authority on 28.08.2023,

the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya had directed the Prison

Authority to produce the Petitioner before him on 04.09.2023. On that

day the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya cancelled all his

previous bail orders and made a fresh order to keep him in remand

custody until the conclusion of the trial in the Balapitiya High Court

case No. CR1.2459/19.

Due to cancellation of his bail in case No. CR1/2459/19, the Petitioner

filed this revision application on following exceptional circumstances.

a) The said order violates the presumption of innocence which is

a fundamental principle of criminal law.

b) The said order is contrary to the provisions of the Bail Act No:

30 of 1997.

c) The said order amounts to a punishment of an accused pending

the conclusion of a criminal trial.

d) The said order gives rise to an indefinite incarceration of an

accused, pending the conclusion of a criminal trial.

e) The said period of incarceration amounts to an oppressive

period of incarceration.

When this matter was supported for notice, it was revealed that the

Petitioner, while on the High Court bail in case No. CR1/2459/19 he

had been remanded for three cases pending before the Magistrate Court

of Balapitiya. After considering the submissions of the prosecution and

on behalf of the Petitioner the Learned High Court Judge had cancelled

his bail and ordered him to be detain in remand until conclusion of the

High Court case. The reverent portion of the order dated 04.09.2023 of

the Learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya is re-produced below:

The Learned High Court Judge had correctly considered the Section

14(1) (a) (iii) of the Bail Act and all-relevant circumstances of the case

when he cancelled bail to the Petitioner after giving his reasons as per

Section 15 of the Bail Act.

Further, as per the Section 14(3) of the Bail Act, the Court may at any

time, where it is satisfied that there has been a change in the

circumstances pertaining to the case, rescind or vary any order made

by it under subsection (1) of the Bail Act.

Considering all the factors in to account very carefully, this is not an

appropriate case to issue notice to the Respondent at this stage. Hence,

this revision application is dismissed.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to send this order to the High

Court of Balapitiya for information.

SAMPATH B. ABAYAKOON, J.
