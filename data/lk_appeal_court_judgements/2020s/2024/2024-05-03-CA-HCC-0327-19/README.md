The Court further ordered the jail sentences imposed on Counts 5-6 against

2nd Appellant to run concurrently each other.

For the 7th Count the 3rd Appellant was sentenced to 05 years rigorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5,000/- subject to a default sentence of 01

imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5,000/- subject to a default sentence of 01

months simple imprisonment.

The Court further ordered the jail sentences imposed on Counts 7-8 against

3rd Appellant to run concurrently each other.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid conviction and sentence, the Appellants

preferred this appeal to this court. The prosecution had called 04 witnesses

and marked P1-6 documents in support of their case.

The 1st Appellant had given evidence from witness box and called two

witnesses on his behalf. The 2nd and 3rd Appellants had made their

statements from the dock.

All the Appellants were present in this Court on the day of the argument as

they were on bail pending appeal granted by the High Court.

On behalf of the 1st Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal were raised.

1. The Learned Trial Judge did not pay adequate attention to the obvious

infirmities of the case for the prosecution.

2. The fact that a cautious approach should be adopted in analysing the

evidence of the Bribery Officers was not sufficiently considered by the

Learned High Court Judge.

3. The reasons for accepting the evidence of the Bribery Officers, rejection

the evidence led on behalf of the defence have not been adequately set

out in the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge.

CA/HCC/327/19

6 | P a g e

4. The fact that the charge was based on the protection of an offender

from prosecution and that the offender had already been produced in

Court at the time of the alleged acceptance was not considered by the

Learned High Court Judge.

5. Evidence of solicitation has been led of facts not covered by the charges

which amounts to leading inadmissible evidence that has caused

prejudice to the 1st Appellant.

On behalf of the 2nd Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal were

raised.

1. There are 07 different versions by the prosecution witnesses which are

inconsistent with each other and given inherent weaknesses, no other

conclusion whatsoever with any other witness against the 2nd

Appellant.

2. The Counts 5 and 6 are connected to Count 01, and the charge is

solicitation of Rs.50,000/-.

3. No date of offence is established by the prosecution.

4. The 1st Appellant did not incriminate 2nd Appellant in his evidence with

regard to solicitation.

5. The evidence given by PW1 is not trustworthy.

6. Given the fact that there is only solitary evidence against the 2nd

Appellant, the Learned High Court Judge had not observed the

demeanour of the witness.

7. No phone call evidence led in the trial.

On behalf of the 3rd Appellant the following Grounds of Appeal were raised.

1. The Learned Trial Judge is erred in law in coming to the conclusion that

the evidence of PW1 is corroborated by the evidence of PW2.

2. The Learned Trial Judge has failed to take into consideration that the

prosecution has failed to prove the charges against the 3rd Appellant.

CA/HCC/327/19

3. The Learned Trial Judge has wrongly refused the evidence of the

defence.

Background of the case.

In this case the 1st and 2nd Appellants are Excise officers and the 3rd

Appellant is a civil citizen.

According to PW1, Rohitha Pushpakumara is a vegetable seller at Peliyagoda

Central Market, and he is married to a lady called Sudharsani Perera. During

the time pertaining to this case, his marriage had virtually come to an end

as his brothers-in-law were engaged in selling narcotics. On 11.06.2012,

when he came home after his business routine, he was informed that his

wife was arrested by officers attached to the Excise Department. When he

went to the Excise Office, he had met 2nd and 3rd Appellants. The 3rd

Appellant is the brother of the witness.

When he inquired from 2nd Appellant, he was told that she was arrested on

a drug charge and the 2nd Appellant demanded Rs.200,000/- from the

witness in order to release his wife without being charge in court. As the

witness did not possess such amount, he had pleaded the 2nd Appellant to

release his wife. Then the 2nd Appellant had directed him to talk to the 1st

Appellant. When he met the 1st Appellant, he too demanded Rs.200,000/-

from the witness. As he did not have such an amount with him, PW1 after a

compromise, agreed to pay Rs.50,000/- to the Excise Officers. In the

meantime, his brother 3rd Appellant also advised PW1 to pay the amount

demanded by the Excise Officers.

On the following day, PW1 had called the Bribery Department and a raid was

arranged by the Bribery officials. When he was at the Bribery Commission,

the 1st Appellant had called PW1 and told that his wife had been produced

in court on the allegation of possession of a Cannabis Cigar and demanded

Rs.50,000/- immediately. Thereafter, as per the arrangement PW1 with PW2

WPC 801 Kalaimany, the decoy had gone to the Excise Office and handed

CA/HCC/327/19

8 | P a g e

over Rs.50,000/- to the 1st Appellant who in turn gave the same to 3rd

Appellant. At that time the Bribery Officials had entered the office and

arrested 1st and 3rd Appellant.

PW2, WPC 801 Kalaimony had given evidence and corroborated the evidence

given by PW1.

The Appellants denied their respective charge/s and adduced evidence to

show that they were arrested on fabricated evidence.

As all the appeal grounds raised by the Counsels for the Appellant are

interconnected, I decided to consider all those appeal grounds together in

this judgment.

In a criminal trial, it is incumbent on the prosecution to prove the case

beyond reasonable doubt. There is no burden on the Appellant to prove his

innocence. This is the Golden Thread as discussed in Woolmington v. DPP

[1935] A.C.462. In this case Viscount Sankey J held that:

Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the

prisoners guilt If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there

is a reasonable doubt, created by the evidence given by either the

prosecution or the prisoner..the prosecution has not made out the case

and the prisoner is entitled to an acquittal.

As the appeal grounds raised by the Appellants are interconnected, I decided

to consider all those grounds together hereinafter.

According to prosecutions stance, the solicitation, which would constitute

an offence under the Bribery Act, was committed by the 2nd Appellant in this

case. According to the evidence led through PW1, he had first met the 2nd

Appellant at the Excise Office and inquired from him about the arrest of his

wife. At that time the 2nd Appellant had confirmed the arrest and solicited

Rs.200,000/- from him to soft pedal the case. Hence, the Learned Presidents

CA/HCC/327/19

9 | P a g e

Counsel appearing for the 1st Appellant strenuously argued that leading of

that evidence amounts to leading highly prejudicial inadmissible evidence

and it prejudices the case for the 1st Appellant as it is alleged that the 2nd

Appellant abetted the 1st Appellant to commit the offences set out in the

indictment.

Next, the Learned Presidents Counsel argued that there was a strong motive

for false implication. The 3rd Appellant in this case happens to be an

informant to Excise Officers. Further, the 3rd Appellant is the brother of PW1.

There had been an animosity due to personal reason over an illegitimate

relationship between the 3rd Appellant and the wife of PW1. Therefore, the

Learned High Court judge should have paid attention to certain

improbabilities and infirmities that surfaced in the prosecutions case.

In Kalinga Padmatilaka v The Director General of Commission to

Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption SC Appeal 99/2007

decided on 30.07.2009 the Supreme Court held that:

It has to be stressed here that credibility of prosecution witnesses

should be subject to judicial evaluation in totality and not isolated

scrutiny by the Judge. When witnesses make inconsistent statements

in their evidence either at one stage or at 2 stages, the testimony of such

witnesses is unreliable and in the absence of special circumstances, no

conviction can be based on the testimony of such witnesses. On the

other hand, one cannot be unmindful of the proposition that Court cannot

mechanically reject the evidence of any witness.

In Gurcharan Singh V. State of Haryana - Criminal Law Journal 1994 (2)

171 the Court held that:

Where the material witnesses make inconsistent statements in their

evidence on material particulars, the evidence of such witnesses

becomes unreliable and unworthy of credence, thus making the

prosecution case highly doubtful.

According to PW1, after complaining to the Bribery Department a raid was

arranged. PW2 acted as a decoy had accompanied PW1, when he went to give

money. PW2, decoy had the money when the duo went to the Excise Office.

The decoy had given the money to PW1. Before he could give the money to

3rd Appellant, the Bribery Department Officers had entered the office and

recovered the money from the 1st Appellant. The 2nd Appellant was not

present at the Excise Office at that time. The relevant portion is re-produced

below:

These contradictions would be of importance in view of the fact that the 1st

Appellant had consistently taken the stance that no money was ever given to

him and that nothing was recovered from him.

Although the above mentioned inter se contradictions were not marked, it is

the duty of the Trial Judge should consider such evidence favourable to the

Accused with utmost care. The Learmned High Court Judge in his judgment

stated as follows:

With this glaring contradiction, the Learned High Court Judge has come to

his own finding that the all money noted were recovered from the 3rd

Appellant. The relevant portion is re-produced below:

This contradictory position of the prosecution witness is not considered by

the Learned High Judge in its correct perspective.

The Apex Court has established precedents in a number of cases stating that

the defense would prevail when there is a contradiction that affects the core

of the case.

When a witness gives evidence before the court upon oath, he is expected to

tell the truth in a court of law. If the person gives contradictory evidence

opposite to the statement, it is usually called a contradiction. It is the duty

of the trail judge to unearth the truth and to come to a conclusion whether

an Accused person is guilty or not.

CA/HCC/327/19

13 | P a g e

In the case of State Rep. by Inspector of Police v. Saravanan AIR 2009 SC

152 the Court held that:

The contradictions/omissions must be of such nature which materially

affects the trial. Minor contradictions, inconsistencies, embellishments

or improvements which do not affect the core of the prosecution case

should not be made a ground to reject the evidence of the witness in its

entirety.

In the case of Shamal Ghosh Vs. State of West Bengal 2012 All. S. C. R,

1921the Court held that:

Omission to state a fact whether it is a material contradiction or not is

a question of fact. The discretion is left with the Court to determine

whether it is a contradiction or material contradiction which renders the

entire evidence of the witness untrustworthy and affects the case of

prosecution materially.

As the contradictory portions of evidence given by PW1, PW2 and PW3 which

is re-produced above certainly affects the root of the prosecutions case, I

conclude that the prosecution has not proved the case against the 1st

Appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, the grounds urged by

Learned Presidents Counsel for the 1st Appellant have merit.

The Learned Presidents Counsel who appeared for the 2nd Appellant

strenuously argued that the charge of solicitation in the indictment had not

proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution. As such, the 2nd

Appellant cannot be charged for aiding and abetting 1st Appellant in the

indictment.

According to PW1, when he went to the Excise Office to see his wife who was

arrested on a drug charge, it was the 2nd Appellant who had demanded

Rs.200,000/- from him to secure his wifes release.

But no charge of solicitation had been framed against the 2nd Appellant. As

such, the money solicited by the 1st Appellant had not been proved beyond

reasonable doubt. Proof of demand is an essential factor in a bribery case.

When considering the totality of the evidence it is crystal clear that the

prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was

solicitation by the 1st Appellant on the date specified in the indictment.

CA/HCC/327/19

15 | P a g e

Also, the prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the

Appellant had accepted the gratification on the date specified in the

indictment.

Hence, the adding and abetting charges framed against the 2nd and 3rd

Appellants also fail.

As the prosecution has failed to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt

against the Appellants, I allow the appeal and acquit them from all the

charges.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this judgment to the High Court

of Colombo along with the original case record.
