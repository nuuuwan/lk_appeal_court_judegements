JUDGMENT

The Petitioner instituted this action by petition dated 29.12.2022 seeking inter alia writs of

Certiorari to quash the decision marked P29 dated 10.08.2022 made by the 9th Respondent

where the 9th Respondent based on the disciplinary inquiry report of the 10th Respondent has

Page 5 of 11

imposed punishment on the Petitioner in accordance with State Mortgage and Investment

Bank Rules.

It should be noted that, earlier the Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court by

case bearing No. CA/Writ/160/22 where one of the reliefs sought by the Petitioner in the

petition marked R1 under prayer (c) was:

c. Grant a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing, the decision reflected

at P-19 dated 06.10.202 to hold a new Disciplinary Inquiry against the Petitioner;

It should be noted that this was refused by the Courts.

The following facts are relevant in this case:

According to the petition, while the Petitioner was in service as an Assistant General

Manager (Credit Administration) in the 1st Respondent Bank on 20.11.2017, a charge sheet

was served on him pertaining to the involvement of the Petitioner in the misconduct or

negligence in approving a personal loan amounting to a sum of Rs. 40,365,000 with another

two employees.

Thereafter, an inquiry was held on the above charge sheet from 28.08.2018 and concluded on

18.12.2019. the Petitioner as per the letter dated 09.03.2018, the Petitioners annual

increments and the bonus were suspended as decided by the Board of Directors until the

disciplinary decision is given. The Petitioner further avers that the decision of the inquiry

dated 18.12.2019 was not communicated to the Petitioner by the Disciplinary Authority of

the Bank.

In any event, the Disciplinary Officer forwarded the Final Report only on 30.10.2020.

According to the said report, the charges were not proved against the Petitioner.

Page 6 of 11

In any event, the Acting General Manager has informed the Petitioner by letter dated

23.02.2022, that a fresh inquiry would be conducted based on the twelve charges against the

Petitioner and that if the Petitioner failed to attend the said inquiry, such would proceed ex

parte. However, the Petitioner states that he informed his inability to attend such an inquiry

to the said Acting General Manager. Thereafter, the inquiry was held on 01.04.2022 and it

was fixed on 21.04.2022 for which the Petitioner did not participate. the Petitioner states

that by letter 21.04.2022, the Petitioner was informed that the tribunal has decided to

proceed with the inquiry ex parte.

In the said case bearing No. CA/Writ/160/22, the Petitioner has challenged the decision to

hold a fresh inquiry. By order dated 23.11.2023, the Court has held that the Disciplinary

Authority has discretion under Rule 16.4 of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank Rules

to quash the decision of the inquiry and order a fresh inquiry. The Court further considered

that the Petitioner had failed to appear before the said inquiry despite him being informed.

Furthermore, the Court formed the opinion that the disciplinary inquiry could be conducted

against retired officers and that the conduct of the Petitioner with regarding the non-

participation in the inquiry.

In the instant application, the main argument put forward by the Petitioner is that the

findings of the 10th Respondent marked as P29 where the Inquiring Officer has come to the

conclusion in the report by not considering the availability of the facts and material placed

before him. The main objection taken by the Respondent is that under Section 18.1 of the

State Mortgage and Investment Bank Rules marked as R2A the Petitioner has an alternative

remedy available to make an appeal to the Appellate Authority.

Page 7 of 11

Apart from that, this Court considers that to issue a writ of Certiorari the Petitioner has to

satisfy the following grounds as set out in Desmond Perera and Others v. Karunarathne,

Commissioner of National Housing and Others, (1994) 3 SLR page 316, at page 329 and 330.

As pointed out by the learned President's Counsel for the 3rd respondent, Lord

Diplock in the case of CCSV v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984) UKHL 9, clearly

classified under three heads, the grounds on which administrative action could be

made subject to control by judicial review. They are:

(i) Illegality;

(ii) Irrationality; and

(iii) (iii) Procedural impropriety.

In the instant case, the Petitioner has failed to satisfy this Court that the 10th Respondent

who held the second disciplinary inquiry and the decision taken by the 9th Respondent to

impose punishment against the Petitioner has acted beyond their jurisdiction and contrary

to the principles of Natural Justice or that the said decision is imminently irrational or

unreasonable.

In addition to that, our Courts have held that, when an alternative and equally efficacious

remedy is available to a party, the party should be required to pursue such remedy before

invoking the writ jurisdiction.

Her Ladyship Shiranee Tilakawardane J. P/CA (as her Ladyship then was) in the case of

Ishak v. Laxman Perera, Director of Customs and Others (2003) 3 SLR 18 at 22 held that:

"Where there is an alternative procedure which will provide the applicant with a

satisfactory remedy the Courts will usually insist on an applicant exhausting that

remedy before seeking judicial review. In doing so the Court is coming to a

Page 8 of 11

discretionary decision.". "Where there is a choice of another separate process outside

the Courts, a true question for the exercise of discretion exists. For the Court to

require the alternative procedure to be exhausted prior to resorting to judicial review

is in accord with judicial review being properly regarded as being a remedy of last

resort. It is important that the process should not be clogged with unnecessary cases,

which are perfectly capable of being dealt with in another tribunal. It can also be the

situation that Parliament, by establishing an alternative procedure, indicated either

expressly or by implication that it intends that procedure to be used, in exercising its

discretion the Court will attach importance to the indication of Parliament's

intention".

Section 18.1 of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank Rules reads as follows:

An employee aggrieved by a disciplinary order made by the Disciplinary Authority

will be permitted to make an appeal to the Appellate Authority

In the instant case, the Petitioner has not lodged an appeal against the said disciplinary

order though he was privileged to do so under the said Rule.

This Courts also notes that there is another effective alternative remedy available under

Section 31B (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act No. 43 of 1950 which reads as follows:

(1) A workman or a trade union on behalf of a workman who is a member of that union,

may make an application in writing to labour tribunal for relief or redress in respect of

any of the following matters:-(See section 7 of Act No. 32 of 1990 relating to pending

actions (set out in Annexure to this Chapter). See also Act No. 19 of 1990 in this

connection.)

(a) the termination of his services by his employer;

Page 9 of 11

(b) the question whether any gratuity or other benefits are due to him from his

employer on termination of his services and the amount of such gratuity and the

nature and extent of such benefits, where such workman has been employed in

any industry employing less than fifteen workmen on any date during the period

of twelve months preceding the termination of the services of the workman who

makes the application or in respect of whom the application is made to the

tribunal;

(c) the question whether the forfeiture of a gratuity in terms of the Payment of

Gratuity Act, 1983 has been correctly made in terms of that Act,

(d) such other matters relating to the terms of employment, or the conditions of

labour, of a workman as may be prescribed.

This Section was considered by His Lordship Alles J in Independent Industrial and

Commercial Employees Union (on behalf of P.T. Fernando) v. Board of Directors, Co-

operative Wholesale Establishment, Colombo 74 NLR 344 at 349 held that:

The Industrial Disputes Act, being a progressive piece of social legislation intended

to promote industrial peace, and whose main object was to ensure harmonious

relations between the employer and employee, has necessarily to protect the interests

of the employee who has voluntarily retired from the services of his employer. An

employee who retires voluntarily from service does not cut himself completely from

the moorings which attach him to his former employer and the language used in

Section 31 B (1)(b) would seem to indicate that a retired employee can obtain relief

from his employer even after he has ceased to be an employee.

Be that as it may, the conduct of the Petitioner is crucial to this action. The Petitioner has

not indicated why he has failed to participate in the said inquiry, knowing the seriousness of

Page 10 of 11

the offence and the allegation made against him that he approved a personal loan amounting

to Rs. 40,365,000/-.

Our Courts have held that even though the Petitioner is entitled to relief, still the Courts can

refuse such considering his conduct.

In Jayaweera v. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another (1996)

2 SLR 70 at page 73, His Lordship Jayasuriya, J held that:

I hold that the Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a writ

of certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a

matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the court has a discretion to deny

him relief having regard to his conduct; delay, laches, waiver, submission to

jurisdiction are all valid impediments which stand against the grant of relief.

Applying these principles, I hold that this court is not disposed to grant the Petitioner

discretionary relief upon this application in view of inordinate delay and laches in

filing the application in Court.

In Center for Environmental Justice and Others v. National Housing Development Authority

and Others, CA/WRT/264/19, Decided on 23.02.2022, His Lordship Mohammed Laffar, J held

that:

In this context, I observe that the Petitioners have been negligent in not addressing

the Court in a timely manner and that they have slept over their rights, if any, without

any reasonable excuse whatsoever. Therefore, as identified above, the Petitioners

prayer for grant of Writs by prayers (c) and (d) being substantial relief sought in their

Petition, cannot be granted due to severe laches. This Court also observes that the

Page 11 of 11

rest of the relief sought by the Petitioners are consequential to the said relief thereto

and thus will not be entitled to such.

Considering the above-mentioned reasoning, we dismiss the application with costs of Rs.

50,000/-
