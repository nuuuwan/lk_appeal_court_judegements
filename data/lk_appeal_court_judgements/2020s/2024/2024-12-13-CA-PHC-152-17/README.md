JUDGMENT

This is an appeal emanating from an order of the Learned High Court Judge of the Western

Province holden in Colombo.

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) filed an

application in terms of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 as amended

(hereinafter referred to as the Act) before the Magistrates Court of Gangodawila for the

purported non-compliance of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the Appellant) with the purported quit notice in respect of 4.82 perches of Railway

Reservation land situated in Maharagama, issued against her and her dependents.

The Appellant raising a preliminary objection on the maintainability of the application before

the Magistrates Court, filed objections dated 22.10.2013 against the said application which

are as follows:

i. Proper notice was not served on the Appellant

ii. The Respondent has failed to file the papers in the proper procedure

iii. Particular summons were not in terms of Section 8(1) of the Act

iv. The opinion formed by the competent authority is illegal

v. Failure to prove that the land is a State land.

Thereafter, the Learned Magistrate having inquired into the matter, made the Order dated

12.02.2014 ejecting the Appellant and her dependents from the impugned land on the basis

that the Appellant has failed to establish that she is in possession or occupation by way of a

valid permit or written authority.

Page 4 of 11

Being aggrieved by the said Order made by the Learned Magistrate, the Appellant had made

a revision application to the High Court of Colombo to revise the order made by the Learned

Magistrate.

Subsequent to the written submissions filed by the parties, the Learned Judge of the High

Court delivered the judgment dated 08.09.2017, holding that there were no exceptional

circumstances to overrule the findings of the Learned Magistrate and dismissed the

application of the Appellant.

The Appellant has preferred the present application in this Court by Petition dated

22.09.2017 being aggrieved by the said judgment of the High Court.

We are mindful that this appeal before this Court is an appeal against the judgment

pronounced by the Provincial High Court exercising revisionary jurisdiction.

I am guided by the following judgments as to how the Court of Appeal is empowered to

evaluate the correctness of the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High

Court. In other words, this Court is to only examine the correctness, legality, or propriety of

the order made by the Provincial High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction.

In Nandawathie and another v. Mhindasena, 2009 (2) SLR 218 at page 238, His

Lordship Ranjith Silva, J. held that;

When an order of a Primary Court Judge made under this chapter is

challenged by way of revision in the High Court the High Court Judge can

examine only the legality of that order and not the correctness of that order.

The High Court may be able to prevent a breach of the peace by issuing interim

stay orders or by allowing an interim order made by the Primary Court Judge

Page 5 of 11

to remain in force. But what is the position when a person aggrieved by such

an order made in revision by the High Court is also appealed against to the

Court of Appeal. Is the Court of Appeal vested with the power to re-hear or

allow the parties to re-agitate the main case by reading and evaluating the

evidence led in the case in the Primary Court or is it that the Court of Appeal

is restricted in its scope and really have the power only to examine the

propriety or the legality of the order made by the learned High Court judge in

the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. I hold that it is the only sensible

interpretation or the logical interpretation that could be given otherwise the

Court of Appeal in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction may be performing

a function the legislature, primarily and strictly intended to avoid. For the

reasons I have adumbrated I am of the opinion that this particular right of

appeal in the circumstances should not be taken as an appeal in the true sense

but in fact an application to examine the correctness, legality or the propriety

of the order made by the learned High Court Judge in the exercise of its

revisionary powers. The Court of Appeal should not, under the guise of an

appeal attempt to re-hear or re-evaluate the evidence led in the main case and

decide on the facts which are entirely and exclusively matters falling within

the domain of the jurisdiction of the Primary Court Judge.

In Jayasekarage Bandulasena and Others v. Galla Kankanamge Chaminda

Kushantha and Another, CA(PHC)/147/2009, Decided on 2017.09.27, His Lordship

P. Padman Surasena, J held that;

Page 6 of 11

The Provincial High Courts need to be mindful of this fact when they are called upon

to exercise revisionary jurisdiction in respect of Primary Court orders of this kind.

Such applications must be treated as only revision applications and not appeals. The

Judges of the Provincial High Courts need to bear in mind that they would only defeat

the purpose of section 74 (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act which has

specifically been enacted by the legislature to take the right of appeal away from the

Parties, if they indirectly assume appellate jurisdiction over this type of applications.

Although there is a right of appeal provided to this Court from an order of the

Provincial High Court, this Court should not forget that it is within the above

parameters that the Provincial High Court has pronounced the impugned order.

Therefore the right of appeal provided by law to this Court would only empower this

Court to evaluate the correctness of the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction by the

Provincial High Court. It cannot be converted to an appeal against a Primary Court

Order.

In these circumstances, in the process of the adjudication of the instant appeal this

Court would need to act within the above parameters. This Court would remind itself

that it is not open for it to treat this case as a true appeal from an order made by the

Primary Court. This is the view expressed by this Court in the case cited above as

well.

The above said judgments were considered by His Lordship Prasantha De Silva, J in

Migallage Gamlath Ralalage Wijesinghe v. A.M. Jayasundara and Others, CA (PHC)

162/2015, Decided on 07.02.2023:

Page 7 of 11

In view of the aforecited Judgment, we are not supposed to consider this as an appeal

preferred against the Order of the Magistrate's Court. We are of the view that the

task before this Court is to ascertain whether this appeal emanates from an Order

pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction.

Thus, the Court of Appeal is empowered to evaluate the correctness of the exercise of

revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High Court. Similarly, the Provincial High

Courts too should be mindful when exercising revisionary jurisdiction in respect of

applications made against the Orders of the Magistrate's Court and should consider

these as revision applications and not as appeals.

In the instant case, the Learned High Court Judge has correctly analyzed the order of the

Magistrates Court that the Appellant has failed to show exceptional circumstances before

coming to the conclusion.

Be that as may, this Court is mindful that the Act does not provide for appeal. Section 10 (2)

of the Act reads thus:

No appeal shall lie against any order of ejectment made by a Magistrate under

subsection (1)

In this context, I am mindful of the dictum of His Lordship Dr. Ranaraja J with regard to the

revision which was pronounced in Colombo Apothecaries Ltd. and Others v. Commissioner

of Labour (1998) 3 SLR 320 at 323:

Revision like an appeal, is directed towards the correction or errors, but it is

supervisory in nature and its object is due administration of justice and not primarily

or solely, the relieving of grievances of a party. An appeal is a remedy, which a party

who is entitled to it, may claim to have as of right and its object is the grant of relief

Page 8 of 11

to a party aggrieved, by an order of court, which is tainted by error. Revision is so

much regarded as designed for cases in which an appeal does not lie. See: Attorney

General v. Gunawardena at 156. In Re the insolvency of Hayman Thornhill. The

power of revision vested in this court is discretionary. The power will be exercised

when there is no other remedy available to a party. It is only in very rare instances

where exceptional circumstances are present that court would exercise powers of

revision in cases where an alternative remedy has not been availed of by an applicant.

See: Rustom v. Hapanagama & Co. at 356, Gunawardena v. Orr, Ameer v. Rasheed,

Perera v. Silva, Alima Natchiya v. Marikar, Fernando v. Fernando.

Thus the general principle is that revision would not lie where an appeal or other

statutory remedy is available. Where the law provides an effective remedy to any

person aggrieved by an order of a Magistrates Court, this Court will not exercise its

revisionary jurisdiction. It is only if the aggrieved party can show exceptional

circumstances for seeking relief by way of revision, rather than by way of appeal, when

such an appeal is available to him as of right, that court will exercise its revisionary

jurisdiction in the interests of due administration of justice.

Where there is a right of appeal available which the party fails to exhaust, and comes for

revision, the Courts generally need to be satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances.

When there are no exceptional circumstances established, in general, the Court dismisses

the application. Nevertheless, when there is no right of appeal available like in the instant

case, I am mindful of the duty cast on the Court to treat the case as a true appeal against an

order made by the Magistrate whether the Learned Magistrate has correctly come to the

conclusion with the evidence placed before him. That is to say, whether the order is correct.

Page 9 of 11

The reason is to ensure the due administration of justice and also Courts should be careful

that there is no miscarriage of justice.

In the instant application, the scope of the inquiry before the Learned Magistrate under

Section 9 of the Act is to find out whether the Appellant has a valid permit or written

authority. The Learned High Court Judge has considered this fact. The scope of the inquiry

is discussed in the following judgments:

In Muhandiram V. Chairman, No.111, Janatha Estate Development Board (1992) 1 SLR 110

at 112, His Lordship Grero J held that:

Under Section 9(1) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979, the

person on whom summons has been served(in this instance, the respondent-

petitioner) shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application

under Section 5 except that such person may establish that he is in possession or in

occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or written authority

is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid.

The said Section clearly reveals that at an inquiry of this nature, the person on whom

the summons has been served has to establish that his possession or occupation is

upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted according to the

written law. The burden of proof that fact lies on that particular person on whom the

summons has been served and appears before the relevant Court. In this case the

burden was on the respondent-petitioner to establish the fact that he had a valid

permit or other written authority of the State to occupy the land which is stated in

the schedule to the application of the Competent Authority.

Page 10 of 11

In Farook V. Gunewardene, Government Agent, Amparai (1980) 2 SLR 243 at 245, His

Lordship Abdul Cader J held that:

At the inquiry before the Magistrate, the only plea by way of defence that the

petitioner can put forward is that he is in possession or occupation of the land upon

a valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance with any

written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid. Section 9 (2) is to the effect that the Magistrate cannot call for any

evidence from the competent authority in support of the application under section 5,

which means that the Magistrate cannot call upon the competent authority to prove

that the land described in the schedule to the application is a State land (Section 5 (1)

(a) (ii). Therefore, the Petitioner will not have an opportunity of raising the question

whether the land is a State or private land before the Magistrate.

In Nirmal Paper Converters (Pvt) Ltd V. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another (1993) 1

SLR 219 at 223. His Lordship Wijeyaratne J held that:

The only ground on which the petitioner is entitled to remain on this land is upon a

valid permit or other written authority of the State as laid down in Section 9 (1) of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. He cannot contest any of the other matters.

The petitioner has not been able to produce any valid permit or other written

authority. Moreover, irreparable loss and harm is caused to the national economy.

Therefore, I am removing the stay order forthwith.

In the instant case, the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge have correctly

considered the scope of the inquiry when coming to the conclusion that the Appellant has not

established that she has a valid permit or other written authority.

Page 11 of 11

Furthermore, one of the objections taken by the Appellant before the Magistrate was that,

the notice had not been properly served.

In Keenigama v. N.D. Dixon Director General, CA 116/95 Decided on 22.02.2001, His

Lordship Raja Fernando J held that:

Section 3(3) of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act provides that a quit

notice is deemed to have been served on the person in possession or occupation if it is

sent by registered post.

In the instant case, there is no dispute that the Appellant did not receive the notice.

Considering the reasons above mentioned in the entirety, we hold there is no reason to revise

the judgment made by the Learned Judge of the High Court on 08.09.2017 and the order

made by the Learned Magistrate on 12.02.2014.

The appeal is dismissed with costs of Rs. 50,000/-
