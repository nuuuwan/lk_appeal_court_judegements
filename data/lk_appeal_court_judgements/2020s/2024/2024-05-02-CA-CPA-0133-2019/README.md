Argued on : Disposed by way of written submissions Written Submissions on : 26.01.2024 (by Petitioner-Petitioners) 26.02.2024 (by Respondent-Respondents) Decided on: 02.05.2024 MOHAMMED LAFFAR, J.

The Petitioner has invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of this court seeking to

set aside the Judgment dated 22.10.2019 of the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Colombo in Case No. HC WA 06/18 (marked 'F')

whereby the Petitioner is seeking an Order in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari

quashing the decision of the Respondents determining the price of a route

permit of the bus route Gampaha - Nugegoda, via Kottawa Inter-Change

(Luxury) (Route Number EX-01-200/138/1) as Rs. 10,000,000/=; an Order

in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the Respondents to fix the price

of a route permit of the bus route Gampaha - Nugegoda, via Kottawa Inter-

Change (Luxury) (Route Number EX-01-200/138/1) as Rs. 8,000,000/= and

an Order in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the Respondents

from charging the Petitioners-Petitioners more than Rs. 8,000,000/= for a

route permit of the bus route Gampaha-Nugegoda, via Kottawa Inter-Change

(Luxury) (Route Number EX-01-200/138/1).

It is submitted that on 15.11.2017, the 4th Respondent Authority published a

newspaper advertisement (marked P3 attached to the Petition marked as 'A')

inviting tenders for passenger service permits, in respect of 102 routes within

the Western Province, including the bus route Gampaha - Nugegoda, via

Kottawa Inter-Change (Luxury) for Route Number EX-01-200/138/1.Upon

the payment of the required deposits stipulated in the notice, the Petitioners

were issued with the tender forms and applicable Guidelines for the tender

procedure (marked as P4 in the Case Record marked as 'X'). According to the

said advertisement there were 8 vacancies. Thereafter, the Petitioners

tendered their respective bids for the said bus route.

Page 5 of 10

When the bids were opened it had been revealed that H. R. Suranjith had

tendered the highest bid of Rs 10,000,000/= and the other of the bids

including that of the Petitioners were respectively as follows;

# The Bidder The Bid

1 H. R. Suranjith Rs. 10,000,000/=

2 L. J. J. Perera Rs. 9,998,790/=

3 L. J. Alwis Rs. 9,729,075/=

4 N. D. B. Vitharana Rs. 9,000,000/=

5 D. A. P. Dissanayaka Rs. 8,178,000/=

6 1st Petitioner Rs. 8,000,000/=

7 2nd Petitioner Rs. 7,800,600/=

8 C. V. Wanniarachchi (1st Bid of the 5th Petitioner) Rs. 7,733,000/=

9 3rd Petitioner Rs. 7,687,550/=

10 4th Petitioner Rs. 7,600,900/=

11 5th Petitioner Rs. 7,233,000/=

12 6th Petitioner Rs. 7,233,000/=

13 W.D.N. Sepala Rs. 7,233,000/=

14 W.D.N. Sepala Rs. 7,233,000/=

15 K. P. C. Dc Silva Rs. 7,233,000/=

16 7th Petitioner Rs. 7,233,000/=

17 8th Petitioner Rs. 7,222,000/=

It is observed that as per Clause 4.2.9 of the Instructions to Tenderers marked

P4, when Tenders are called for two or more route permits for the same route,

the first route permit should be awarded to the highest bidder at his bid price,

which shall be the route permit price for all purposes of that Tender, and

the remaining route permits should be awarded to the bidders who have

placed the next highest bid prices.

Page 6 of 10

Based on the bids received, the route permit had been fixed at Rs. 10,000,000

being the value of the highest bid received.

It is brought to the attention of this court that H. R Suranjith (bid #1) who

quoted the highest bid had thereafter not accepted the award of the tender

and he has not made the payment in terms of letter marked as P13 dated

22.12.2017. It is also submitted by the Petitioners that 5 more bidders who

submitted their respective bids at the positions of 2, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 15 had

also failed to comply with their respective letters sent by the 4th Respondent

Authority and had failed to comply with the guidelines marked P4, and thus

have not accepted the award of the tender. In this context, it the position of

the Petitioners that the route permit must be fixed at Rs. 8,000,000 being the

highest price of the awards that had been rightfully acted upon.

However, the Respondents submit that Clause 7.1 of the Instructions to

Tenderers (Tender Guidelines) marked P4, provides that upon the tender

opening, an initial analysis is conducted to ascertain if the tender applications

have been submitted in accordance with the tender conditions and any tender

application that has not been prepared in accordance with the tender

conditions will be rejected by the 4th Respondent Authority and other valid

bids are considered at the stage of tender evaluation. Clause 8.1 of the

Instructions to Tenderers stipulates that the selected applicants should be

informed that their bids have been accepted by a letter of award. It is

submitted that the letters dated 22.12.2017 marked P13, P14 and P15 are

such letters of award issued thereafter. Thus, only the bids that are

considered valid, i.e., the tender applications that deemed to have been

prepared and submitted in accordance with the tender conditions, are

considered at the stage of tender evaluation and the selection. The said letters

marked P13, P14 and P15 state that the Procurement Committee of the 4th

Respondent Authority has decided to award route permits for passenger

transport at the approved permit charge of Rs. 10,000,000/-.

Page 7 of 10

While it is noted that the said H.R. Suranjith did not pay 50% of the approved

permit charge of Rs. 10,000,000/- on or before 3rd January 2018 at no stage

had the said H.R. Suranjith revoked his bid prior to or after the issuing of the

letter of award marked P13.

The 1st and 2nd Petitioners have unconditionally accepted the route permit

price of Rs. 10,000,000/- by paying a sum of Rs. 5,000,000/- each, being the

50% initial payment as per Clauses 11.1 and 14.1 of the said Instructions to

Tenderers.

It is also submitted by the Respondents that the Procurement Committee of

the 4th Respondent and/or the Respondents do not have any power to reduce

the route permit price once it is unconditionally accepted by a bidder by

making the 50% initial payment.

It is also pertinent to note that the 1st, 4th, 5th and 7th Petitioners have now

transferred their route permits to third parties.

Attention of court is drawn towards the Fundamental Rights Application No.

Sc (FR) 91/2018 which was dismissed by the Supreme Court by Judgment

dated 24h October 2023 where the court observed as follows:

11) While it is true that the Guidelines do not contain any provision for

the reduction of price in the event of the highest bid proving unsuccessful,

Clause 4.2.7 provides that where the successive bidders do not consent

to paying the former permit charge and the Procurement Committee is of

the opinion that the highest bid is excessively high, they may grant the

route permit at a bid price deemed appropriate. The Petitioners submit

that the Respondents had in a similar situation, in respect of the

Nittambuwa-Moratuwa bus route, acted under this clause to consider the

second highest successful bidder as the highest successful bidder after

the former highest bidder did not make the payment within the stipulated

time. In light of the Respondent's decision to reduce the bid price in that

Page 8 of 10

instance, and failure to do so in the present case, the Petitioners allege

that they have been discriminated and such treatment violates equal

protection guaranteed to them by Article 12(1).

12) The Respondents, in response, submit that the reason for the such

consideration in the grant of route permits for the Nittambuwa-Moratuwa

is that the highest bidder's price (Rs. 8,600, 000) was 129% higher than

the second highest bidder's bid price (Rs. 3,755,500). In that instance,

the Procurement Committee, upon being informed by the successive

bidders that the permit charge was excessively high and being requested

that the permit price be offered at the second highest bid price, decided

the amount to be excessively high. The meeting minutes of the

Procurement Committee (marked R15') reflect the above reasoning. The

Respondents submit that in the present case, the highest bidder's price

(Rs. 8,500,000) was only 13.33% higher than the second highest bidder's

price (Rs. 7,500,000). The Respondents submit that the Procurement

Committee did not consider this disparity 'excessively high'.

13) The Petitioners have produced no material before this court which

indicates mala fides on the part of the Procurement Committee and the

Respondent Authority. Neither have the Petitioners adduced any material

substantiating the claim that the Respondents exercised their discretion

in a manner that is abusive of such power, or contrary to law. It must be

stated that although discretion should be exercised equitably, discretion

itself is subjective in that every decision is subject to related

circumstances and facts. The Right to Equality enshrined in Article 12(1)

is violated in administrative matters where procedural fairness is

deprived. His Lordship Justice Raja Fernando succinctly stated this

court's view on the application of Administrative Guidelines and their

relation to fairness and equality in Samaraweera v. The People's Bank

and Others (2007] 2 SLR 362.

Page 9 of 10

"It is my view that all circulars and other guidelines must be applied fairly

and equally to all persons to whom they apply." [p. 370]

14) The Procurement Committee's adherence to the Tender Guidelines

must therefore be assessed bearing in mind the discretion the Guidelines

themselves confer upon the Committee to determine the Tender Charge.

It is not reasonable nor equitable that the Procurement Committee be

expected to dole out the same treatment in every Tender process without

regard or care for the fact that it has been vested with the discretion to

vary its procedure depending on the specific circumstances, taking into

account the financial effect that such uniform treatment may bear on the

authority and bidders. A variation in the manner in which discretion is

exercised cannot, by itself, translate to discriminatory treatment in

violation of Article 12(1) as discretion' inherently embodies the

dependence of decision making on circumstance.

"It is a Fundamental Rule for the exercise of discretionary power that

discretion must be brought to bear on every case: each one must be

considered on its own merits and decided as the public interest requires

at the time." (Wade & Forsyth, Administrative Law, 10th Edition, Ox ford

University press, p. 271] 9

His Lordship Justice Kodagoda, P.c, in SC. FR. Application No. 256/17

(S.C Minutes of 11.12.2020) between one W.P.S Wijerathne and the Sri

Lanka Ports Authority stated the following regarding matters where

discretion is exercised for matters of 'selection':

"..it is of critical importance that, discretionary authority is exercised by

Executive and by administrative authorities in public trust, only for the

purpose of securing the purpose for which such power had been

conferred, for the best interests of the organization concerned, for the best

interests

Page 10 of 10

of the State, and in overall public interest. Not adhering to these vital

norms, can certainly result in an infringement of Article 12 of the

Constitution. " [p. 231]"

In this instance it is observed that while the route permit was fixed at Rs.

10,000,000 the contented value prayed for at Rs. 8,000,000 is not at an

excessive variance. Thus, even at the said price difference being 25% higher;

in the backdrop of the guidelines/instructions, this court observes that there

is no necessity for the price to be revised by the 4th Respondent as it is not

excessively higher in the backdrop of the due process having being rightfully

followed.

This court sees no illegality and/or procedural impropriety in the conduct of

the Respondents as more fully analysed hereinabove. Therefore, I see no

exceptional or special circumstances to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of

this court in order to revise or set aside the judgement of the learned High

Court.
