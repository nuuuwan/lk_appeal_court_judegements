Sobhitha Rajakaruna J. (Acting P/CA)

This is a matter in which both parties agreed that the instant Application would be dealt with

and determined solely on the basis of written submissions.

The 1st Petitioner- Company (Company) entered into an agreement bearing No. 362 with

the 4th Respondent- Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) on 19.07.2001 following section

17 of the Board of Investment Law No. 04 of 1978 (BOI Law). The said agreement is

annexed and marked as P6. Before entering into the said agreement, the Company by way

of the application marked P7, sought approval for an investment in a project manufacturing

old non-ferrous metals such as copper, wire bars, brass ingots, tin ingots, zinc ingots, gunmetal

ingots from imported scrap and expanding to value-added products such as copper and brass

rods, wires, etc. Subsequently, the Company and the BOI entered into three supplementary

agreements on 17.06.2009, 12.03.2010, and 29.04.2010 respectively.

The Petitioners contend that the Company has set up and commenced operations under the

said agreement P6 and engaged in the export of copper wire, rods and ingots between the

years 2001 and 2014. Upon requests made by the Company, the BOI has permitted the

Company to import PVC-insulated copper cable scrap as raw material. The Ministry of

Industry of Commerce and Ministry of Traditional Industries and Small Enterprise

Development by way of letters marked P22 and P23 have informed the Company that they

did not have any objection subject to relevant laws and regulations, to the importation and/or

sourcing of copper scrap locally and, exporting finished products in accordance with the

agreements between the BOI and Company. The Company took further steps to import and

install machinery for producing copper, copper alloy and brass sheets. Accordingly, the

Company commenced producing copper, copper alloy, and brass sheets and exporting such

goods.

In the meantime, the BOI requested the Company on 13.10.2014 (P20) to submit the source

of raw material and the finished products to be exported. Such request was made in response

to a plea made by the Company to export machinery and raw materials to produce more

value-added products (such as aluminium plate, sheet and circle, brass plate, sheet n circle

and copper plate, sheet and circles) out of imported and local raw material in phase wise

Page 6 of 15

manner. Following the approval of the BOI on 06.01.2015, the Company proceeded to engage

in an additional agreement with the BOI on 18.02.2015 (P29) and the said agreement

allowed for the duty-free importation of machinery, enabling the initiation of manufacturing

processes for value-added products.

However, it is noted that the BOI granted the said approval subject to the condition that

reconciliation of utilization of imported and locally procured raw materials should be

submitted at the time of importation/ purchase to the Investment Appraisal and the Investor

Services Departments of the BOI. The BOI by its letter dated 05.01.2017 (R3) permitted the

Company to purchase the required raw materials subject to such terms and conditions in the

agreements P6 and P29. Accordingly, the Company is bound to submit individual requests

for all purchase of raw material from the local market for approval of the Investment

Department of the BOI along with the reconciliation of utilization of both imported and local

raw materials.

By letter dated 14.10.2014 (R2), the Company has provided details to the BOI including the

raw material quantities required per annum through local purchase and importation. As per

the declaration made by the Company in R2 only 1200 MT were to be sourced through local

purchase whereas 1800 MT were to be sourced through import. Significantly, the Company

has categorically intimated to BOI that it will not purchase the total requirement of copper

scrap locally.

Subsequently, the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade made

Regulations under section 20 read with subsection (3) of section 4 and section 14 of the

Imports and Exports (Control) Act No. 1 of 1969. Such Regulations were published in

Gazette Extraordinary No. 2044/40 on 09.11.2017 requiring an export license from the

Department of Import and Export Control for the Export of items mentioned in the Schedule

III of the said Regulation. It appears that the HS codes 7409.19- Copper sheet and 7409.2900-

Copper alloy sheet, Brass sheet are included in Schedule III of the above-referred export

Regulation. The Regulations provide that they shall also apply to the business entities

established under the BOI Law. The BOI issued a letter on 10.01.2019 (R5) to the

Department of Import and Export Control recommending that the companies who have

Page 7 of 15

signed agreements with the BOI after 11.03.2009 may follow the provisions of the Gazette

Notification No. 1592/10 dated 11.03.2009 and obtain the necessary import and export

licenses.

In this backdrop the Petitioners contend that the supplementary agreement marked P13

permitted the Company to manufacture value-added products imported and/or sourced

locally in addition to the activities already permitted under the principal agreement P6. The

Petitioners further contend that the supplementary agreement P16 also provides for the

manufacture of non-ferrous metal products such as sheets and plates out of scrap and prime

metal imported and sourced locally. By supplementary agreement marked P18

manufacturing out of scrap and prime metal imported and/or sourced locally was also

permitted.

Nevertheless, the government implemented restrictions on utilizing locally sourced copper

scrap to manufacture their products. Such decisions are reflected in the documents marked

P35, P38, P40 and P41. Thus, the Petitioners challenging those prohibitions imposed by

the authorities, seek a writ of certiorari quashing the decisions contained in those documents

P35, P38, P40 and P41.

The said P35 includes the minutes of a meeting chaired by the Minister of Industry and

Supply Chain Management, held on 21.02.2020 at which the Company was also represented.

During the said meeting, a resolution has been reached to restrict the export of value-added

copper wire and plates after a period of six months. Such a decision has been communicated

to the Controller General of the Department of Import and Export Control by letter dated

09.07.2020 marked P39. The Secretary to the above Ministry, in P39, has divulged that

companies registered under the BOI, when exporting their metal-related products, should

provide sufficient written evidence from the Ministry of Industry and Supply Chain

Management with its recommendation to prove that materials used for such products are

imported. In addition to the above, the Company was also informed interalia by way of a

letter dated 13.07.2020, marked P40, that the manufacturers of value-added copper wire and

the copper plate will be granted only 6 months up to 25.08.2020 to export as value-added

copper wire and copper plate. Similarly, in furtherance to the discussions had with the BOI,

Page 8 of 15

a letter dated 23.07.2020, marked P41, has been sent to the Company by BOI advising it not

to purchase copper scrap or any other metal scrap from the local market to utilize for the

manufacturing process from the date of the said letter.

The Petitioners submit that there is no rational basis to differentiate between producing copper

metal sheets/ plates and manufacturing other products. Further, it is submitted that only BOI

companies such as the 1st Petitioner be affected by such orders and thus, such prohibition is

targeted to discriminate against the Company in violation of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution.

The Petitioners further challenge the decisions contained in the documents marked P65,

P66, P75, P76 and P77. Those documents seemingly relate to the refusal by Sri Lanka

Customs to export the products of the Company and it may be based on imports and exports

control license issued (by the Department of Imports and Exports Control) in respect of the

exportation described in those respective documents. The Petitioners argue that the

imposition of the condition mandating approval from the Industrial Development Board

(IDB) for exporting copper-based products by Sri Lanka Customs is unlawful, as the IDB

lacks the authority to grant export approvals under the Industrial Development Act.

As opposed to the Petitioner's arguments the Respondents contend that the Company sourced

all its copper scrap locally and only imported Zinc for its manufacturing process and such

process has involved transforming locally sourced copper scrap into various forms without

substantial value addition. The Secretary to the Ministry of Industries affirming an Affidavit

submits that the Company sourced all copper scrap from the local market and the only

material imported for the process was Zinc and was merely transforming copper scrap,

materials sourced locally into different forms of scraps which does not involve a substantial

value- addition. His affidavit is annexed to the Statement of Objection filed on behalf of the

1st, 3rd, 7th, and 9th to 15th Respondents. The said Secretary has further affirmed that;

i. the amount of copper scrap that was exported for a long period of time has deprived

the local metal industry of adding any substantial value which resulted in a massive

loss to the country's economy;

Page 9 of 15

ii. the exportation of copper scrap in the particular form was observed to have rendered

the objectives of the BOI agreement nugatory; in view of gaining maximum benefit to

the local economy by enhancing value addition of products and processes of the

exporting facilities and strengthening the local industries, the Industrial Development

Board recommended a regularized monitoring mechanism to address the development

of local products.

The 1st, 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 11th to 15th Respondents aver that due to numerous complaints from

local copper industrialists regarding a shortage of raw materials in the local market, the IDB

investigated manufacturing facilities involved in exporting copper scrap-based products. The

minutes of the meetings with the participation of the local copper industrialists, where these

concerns were raised, are marked as R1', while the IDB Report dated 12.02.2020 is marked

as R2'. According to these Respondents, the said inspection has revealed that the Company

procured all its copper scraps from the local market and imported only zinc for the

manufacturing process, essentially converting locally sourced copper scraps into various

forms without significant value addition.

The said Respondents further contend that following a complaint from the Casting Industries

Owners Association of Sri Lanka urging against granting approval for purchasing Copper and

Brass from the local market, an operational audit was conducted by the Department of

Commerce and the BOI, on 07.08.2019. The inspection report was then forwarded to the

Ministry of Industry on 16.09.2019. Subsequently, the Ministry of Industries requested the

BOI to provide a breakdown of the annual production of each product manufactured by the

Company. The BOI communicated via a letter dated 03.02.2020 to the company that such

information should be submitted to the Ministry of Industries.

Both the Petitioners and the Respondents have drawn the attention of this Court to the

Cabinet decision taken on 09.11.2020, marked P80A. The following paragraphs of P80A

are noteworthy:

07. Supplying the necessary Scrap Metal for the Local Small Scale Industrialists

Page 10 of 15

The Inter Ministry Task Force on Industry and Enterprise and the Task Force

on Economic Rehabilitation and Poverty Alleviation had discussed the issues

relating to the metal industry in their meetings and as determined in those

discussions, steps have been taken to make restrictions to the export of scrap

Copper, Aluminium, Stainless Steel, High Carbon Iron, Brass, Tints, Scrap

Aluminium blocks and zinc blocks with immediate effect with the view to

providing sufficient raw material for the Local Small Scale Industrialists.

According to a research conducted by Sri Lanka Industrial Development Board

and University of Moratuwa, it has been proved that the demand for scrap Iron,

Tints, Aluminium, Copper and Brass has been increased by the Local

Industrialists and the demand for Zinc, Manganese, High Carbon Iron and

Stainless Steel has being increased. Demand for Scrap Metal is expected to be

increased further in line with policies of the government to promote Local

Industries. Therefore, it is appropriate to reconsider the current permission for

the export of copper wire in order to use more value added products.

As per approval was granted by the Cabinet of Ministers to use scrap Iron,

Copper, Aluminium, Stainless Steel, High Carbon Iron, Brass and Tints and

scrap Aluminium blocks and zinc blocks only for the local use and export of

unusable scrap metal only on the recommendation of the Sri Lanka Industrial

Development Board and the other relevant institutions.

However, the Petitioners claim that the above decision will not have any effect on the

Petitioners in as much as they are not exporting scrap metal and are only engaged in the

export of finished high-value-added products locally.

Now I must examine whether the fundamental rights of the Petitioners have been infringed

by executive or administrative action of any one or more of the Respondents as the Petitioner's

primary claim in the instant application clung on the alleged infringement of fundamental

rights. The Petitioners challenge the decisions reflected in P35, P38. P40 and P41 on the

footing that their rights under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution have been violated by

imposing restrictions for the use of locally sourced copper scrap to manufacture their products

Page 11 of 15

and differentiate the production of copper metal sheets/ plates and the manufacture of other

products. The Petitioners based their argument on the precedent set by W. K. C. Perera v. Prof.

Daya Edirisinghe (1995) 1 SLR 148, which revitalized the judicial review process by

prioritizing the protection of the fundamental rights of those affected. In this instance,

Fernando J. emphasized the necessity for administrative decisions to align with Article 12 of

the Constitution and adhere to broader standards of review.

I have decided in R.A. Piyaratna and Others v. Buddhist and Pali University of Sri Lanka and

Others CA/WRIT/133/2022 decided on 10.06. 2022 that the public trust doctrine, violation of

fundamental rights, or any other grounds established through judicial innovation should only

be considered in judicial review applications as a means to reach a determination by the court

'in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution' and 'according to law'. I have

determined that the grounds for review in writ applications are closely intertwined with the

fundamental rights recognized by the law, and any adoption of such grounds should be

cautiously undertaken by Review Courts, adhering to the limitations mentioned above and

based on the respective jurisdiction of the Court

The progression of jurisdiction over Fundamental Rights and the evolution of Rights-Based

Judicial Review needs to be taken into consideration when reviewing a writ application in

which the respective petitioner seeks relief in an alleged infringement of fundamental rights

described in Chapter III or Chapter IV of the Constitution. However, within this evolution, a

significant ambiguity emerges about whether the principle of public trust or the clear

acknowledgement of Fundamental Rights recognized in the Constitution serves as direct

grounds for judicial review within the writ jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. This lack of

clarity raises concerns about the integrity of the distinctions between writ jurisdiction and

jurisdiction over fundamental rights, which could be made worse by judicial activism.

The law concerning the doctrine of ultra vires has evolved considerably over time. The courts

have progressively shifted their stance from historical doctrines and expanded the scope of

statutory interpretation to ensure adherence to constitutional principles and protection of

fundamental rights. The evolving role of the Court of Appeal exhibits a unique change in

addressing grievances stemming from the actions of public authorities. This transformation

Page 12 of 15

may suggest an expanded mandate for the Court of Appeal to offer solutions for breaches of

fundamental rights. As noted by the Supreme Court in the cases of Heather Therese Mundy v

Central Environmental Authority and others, SC Appeal 58/2003 (SC Minutes of 20.01.2004)

(Judgment by Mark Fernando J.) and Sri Lanka Telecom Ltd. vs. the Human Rights Commission

of Sri Lanka and Others (2017) SC Appeal No. 215/12 (SC Minutes 01.03.2017) it can be

assumed that the Constitutional principles and provisions have reduced the scope of

administrative discretion and immunity. In other words, the latest tendency shown by

superior courts in a few cases is that the actions of public authorities must not infringe upon

any fundamental rights. Failure by public authorities to meet this requirement may warrant

any individual a remedy under Article 140 of the Constitution.

Anyhow, the practice of litigants pursuing parallel legal proceedings in both the Court of

Appeal and the Supreme Court raises questions about the necessity and fairness of such

actions. While litigants have the right to explore different legal avenues, engaging in multiple

proceedings without adequate justification can be seen as an abuse of the process of the court,

burdening judicial resources and prolonging litigation unnecessarily. Similarly, the

exploration of forum shopping, bench hunting, and the principle of res judicata within the

context of fundamental rights jurisdiction and rights-based writ jurisdiction underscores

significant challenges to the integrity and fairness of the legal system.

In light of the above, I take the view that the Court of Appeal needs to strike a proper balance

when considering an alleged infringement of Fundamental Rights described in Chapter III or

Chapter IV of the Constitution in a judicial review application. Irrespective of judicial

activism in writ applications the Court of Appeal will be bound by the provisions in Article

126 (3) of the Constitution and accordingly, the Court of Appeal should forthwith refer a writ

application if it appears to Court that there is prima facie evidence of an infringement or

imminent infringement of the provisions of Chapter III or Chapter IV of the Constitution.

Thus, I need to consider whether the aforesaid Company experienced discrimination and was

deprived of equal protection of the law. It is noted that the business identified in the principal

agreement P6 that has been entered into between the BOI and the Company is to set up/

conduct and operate a business for the manufacture and export of non-ferrous metal products

Page 13 of 15

in the export processing zone at Horana. In my view, the alleged disputes disclosed in the

Petition commenced after the BOI permitted the company to purchase raw materials locally.

The BOI may permit investors to purchase raw materials from local sources as part of their

investment activities, depending on the specific regulations and guidelines in place at the time.

These permissions may vary based on factors such as the type of investment, industry sector,

and government policies regarding local sourcing and foreign investment. Investors should

consult with the BOI or should obtain legal instructions on the law relating to BOI agreements

and the general law of the country.

In Ace Healthcare (Pvt) Ltd v. Major General (Retired) Vijitha Ravipriya, Director General of

Customs and Others- CA/ Writ/ 171/ 2022 (decided on 30.05.2023) I have observed that several

clauses of the Agreement subjected to that case, tend to provide that all other taxes and levies

related to importing items other than the customs duty are payable as applicable by the

respective investor. Thus, any investor (the Enterprise) who enters into an agreement under

the BOI Law shall be subject to all other laws, not referred to in Schedule 'B' of the said BOI

Law, save and except any exemptions and/or benefits and/or privileges specifically granted

to it by such other laws and/or orders and/or regulations framed thereunder.

Dr. Shirani A. Bandaranayake CJ. in Ceylon Quartz Industries (Private) Limited vs. The

Director General of Customs, S.C. Appeal No. 79/2002 decided on 04.10.2012 stated;

The position therefore is quite clear. Business Enterprises were invited to enter into agreements

with the BOI offering different types of concessions for them. This included in terms of Clause

10(ix) concession from export duty and any custom or export control. To obtain such concessions,

it would be necessary that the relevant goods and articles are manufactured or produced in

accordance with the Agreement. It is also necessary to refer to the provisions of Clause 10(ix). It

provides for any Governmental authority to examine the correctness of any declaration made.

However, this is subject to the condition that such authority should be exercised in the manner as

directed by none other than the BOI. (Emphasis added)

In light of the above, I take the view that the legal obligations binding investors, including the

said Company, extend to all regulations and laws not exempted by the BOI Law. Despite the

authorization from the BOI for local raw material procurement within specified parameters,

Page 14 of 15

adherence to broader National regulations and laws remains imperative. This underscores the

importance of meticulous legal compliance and ongoing diligence in navigating regulatory

frameworks for both investors and regulatory bodies alike.

Based on the overall circumstances of this case and the material made available to this Court,

it is evident that the Company primarily sourced its copper scrap locally and imported only

Zinc for its manufacturing process, which was essentially transforming locally sourced copper

scrap into various forms without substantial value addition. The concerns raised by the

Secretary to the Ministry of Industries regarding the exportation of copper scrap and its impact

on the local metal industry highlight the economic implications at stake. Moreover, the

investigation conducted by the IDB in response to complaints from local copper industrialists

further corroborates the Company's procurement practices. The operational audit conducted

by the Department of Commerce and the BOI, followed by the request for production

breakdowns by the Ministry of Industries, reinforce the regulatory scrutiny surrounding the

Company's operations. Therefore, considering these factors, it is imperative to note that the

Company has failed to comply with some important provisions of the agreements entered

into between the BOI. Furthermore, I am of the view that the conduct of the Company has

affected the broader regulatory objectives to ensure the promotion of local industry and value

addition as intended by the regulatory framework.

The BOI has authorized the Company to purchase raw materials locally in addition to the

terms and conditions of the principal agreement P6 and subject to the provisions in the

supplementary agreements and more importantly subject to other Regulations and Laws of

the Country. Changing the policy by the relevant Authorities according to law in respect of

the matters which are governed under the laws, other than the BOI Law is a factor that the

Company should oversee at the time of entering into the principal agreement or the

supplementary agreements with the BOI. Substantial evidence has been tendered to this Court

that the Company has purchased raw material locally exceeding the limitations agreed upon

by both the Company and the BOI.

These circumstances do not suggest this Court to observe any prima facie infringement of the

fundamental rights under Article 12 (1) of the Constitution. Moreover, I am not satisfied that

any lawful right of the Company or other Petitioners have been substantially affected. Further,

Page 15 of 15

I take the view that no substantial prejudice has been caused to the Petitioners due to the

decisions reflected in the impugned documents. It is observed, as per the Journal Entry dated

09.03.2022, that the 1st, 3rd, 7th, 9th, and 11th to 15th Respondents had no objection for this Court

to make an order enabling the Petitioners to export the products described in P65, P75,

P76 and P77. Likewise, the Petitioners have failed to disclose effectively any blatant

miscarriage of justice warranting this Court to invoke its inherent jurisdiction in order to issue

writs as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition. Thus, I proceed to dismiss the instant

Application of the Petitioners.

Application is dismissed.
