CASE NO - CA (PHC) i\PN - 9212014 -Judgment - 13.11.2015

P.R.Walgama, J

The instant ap~1L'al arises against the backdrop of the following

facts:

Registered owner - Claimant - Petitioner - Petitioner (in sh0l1 the

Petitioner) has come by way of revision seeking inter alia;

To revIse and set aside the confiscation order dated 13.11.2013 of

the Learned Magistrate of Puttlam. ~

AND

To rcyise and set aside the order dated 30.04.2014 of the High

Court Judge of Puttlam.

The Petitioner was the Registered owner of the Lorry bearing

No.226 - 3757 which was used by the accused for transportation of

timber without a valid permit. At the trial in the Magistrate COUl1

of Puttlam~ the accused pleaded guilty to the charge and the

Learned Magistrate has fixed the case for mqUlry regarding the

confiscation of the subject Lorry, whereupon the Learned

Magistrate deemed to have contiscated the above Lorry by the

order dated 13.11.2013.

In the above mqUlry the stance of

the alleged offence has been committed

the Petitioner, was that

by the accused without

his knowledge Further he has admitted that he does not

know, whether the accused had a driving license or not,

Besides Petitioner has not inquired about the vehicle after

it has been handed oVl?r to the accused VIZ the driver.

The Learned Magistrate III the said impugned order has alluded

to the celibrated Judgment of MANAWADU .VS. ATTORNEY

GENERAL (1987) ") SLR 30.

In following the above Judgment the Learned Magistrate has

adhered to the rule of Audi alteram parte and allowed, . the

Petitioner (Registered Owner) to adduced evidence at the II1qulry

In to the confiscation of the vehicle In Issue.

It IS apparent from the document marked Xl that the

Commercial' Leasing Company was the absolute owner of the

vehicle and by the document marked X2 the said

Commercial Leasing Company has issued the said document

marked X2, to the effect that they have no objection 111

releasing the vehicle 111 Issue to the Petitioner.

The Petitioner's position was that the accused had used the

said vehicle to transport timber without a valid permit, without

his knowledge, and the said vehicle was gIven only to

transport bricks and Cajon and not any other material.

In fact the Petitioner has admitted the that he never

checked whether the accused (driver) has a driving license,

and after handing over the vehicle to the accused he does

not IIlqUlre III to any matter there after.

5

IIThe Learned Magistrate has considered that the Petitioner has

although .... stated that, he had gIven instructions to the driver,

he had not explained what it was.

In the said backdrop the Learned Magistrate was of the vIew

that the Petitioner has failcd to satisfy court that he took

every precaution to avoid the commIssIon of the offence II1

terms of Section 40 of amcndment Act No 65 of 2009

of the Forest Ordinance, and had contiscated the said vehicle.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner has assailed

the said order to the High Couli of Puttlam by way of lRevision.

In considering the above application of the Petitioner, the

Learned High Couli Judge was of the vIew that the Learned

Magistrate has arrived to the Conclusion, to confiscate the said

vehicle II1 the correct perspective, and being satisfied with the

reasons set out there In had affirmed the said impugned order.

Aggrieved by the above order of the High Court Judge dated

30.04.2014, the Petitioner has lodged, an application II1 Revision

seeking to set aside the said impugned orders of the

Learned High Couli Judge and the Learned Magistrate made

on the above dates.

In the instant application II1 Revision, the Respondent has

taken a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of this

application.

6

The ground norm of the said objections relate to the failure

on the part of the Petitioner to exercIse the right of

appeal.

The Counsel for the Respondent has adverted court to the

Judgment of Abcywardcna.Vs. Ajith De Silva -1998(1) SLR 134

where In it was held that "an appeal should be lodged In the

Court of Appeal 111 respect of an order arrived by a Provincial

High Court exerclslllg its revIsIonary jurisdiction"

Therefore it is contended by the Counsel for th~

that the Petitioner has failed to indicate the reasons why

the COUl1 of Appeal should exercIse revIsIonary powers when a

right of appeal against the same was available. Further it

IS alleged that the Petitioner has not averred the existence

of any exceptional circumstance, which warrant the exercIse

of the RevisIonary jurisdiction of this Court. The said

legal position was recognized III the case of DHARMARA TNE

ANOTHER .VS. Pt\LMPARADISE CABANAS LTD AND AND

OTHERS 2003 (3) SLR - 25. Which has held thus;

"Existence of exceptional circumstances

which the Court selects the cases III

extraord inary method of rectification

such a selection process IS not there

this COUl1 will become a gateway of

a second appeal 111 the garb of a

IS the process by

respe(:t of ' . .,,!1i'2h tho

should be adopted, if

reVIsIonary jurisdiction of

every litigant to make

Revision Application or

to make an appeal III situations where the legislature has

not gIven a right of appeal ... "

It also 'salient to recognized the substance that stemmed

from the Judgment 111 case of V ANIK INCORPORATION LTD

. VS . JAY ASEKARA - 97 (2) SLR. 365 which held thus;

"Revisionary power should be exercised where a miscarriage of

justice has occurred due to a fundamental rule of procedure

being violated, and also that not 111 all instances where there

has been . . a miscarriage but only when a strong case IS made

of justice" out amounting to a positive . . mlscarnage

Thus it IS asserted by the Counsd for the Respondent that 111

the instant matter the Petitioner has not established that by the

said impugned orders. substantive . . of justice has miscarriage

been caused to him which warrants this Court to exercise its

discretionary power of revIsion.

It IS salient to consider the Judgment of K. MARY MATILDA

SIL VA . VS. P.H. DE SILVA INSPECTOR OF POLICE, Decided

on -08.07.2010 which has observed thus;

"It the Com1s of this Country are gOll1g to say that it

IS sufficient, then all that the owner 111 a case of this nature

has to say IS that. ... (1 gave verbal instructions to the driver to not

use the vehicle to commit offence) even for the second offence.

This IS no end. to the commiSSion of the offence. "Then the

purpose of the legislature 111 enacting the proVISO to Section 40

( 1 ) of the Forest Ordinance IS frustrated"

The stance of the Petitioner IS that the High Court Judge has

erred 111 law 111 the exercise of his revIsionary powers bv requmng

the Petitioner to prove his case beyond reasonable doubt and not

on a balance of probability. But it IS worthy to mention that for

the Petitioner to say merely that he never had the knowledge of

the commiSSion of the alleged

'--offence or to say that he had

advised the driver, not to engage 111 illegal transp0l1ation is bv

no means proof of his IIlnocence or IS not sufficient to exonerate

him from any liability.

For the above compelling reasons I am of the view that this

Court should not interfere with the said impugned orders.

Hence would therefore dismiss the appeal.

Appeal IS dismissed subject to a cost of Rs. 10,0001-

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

W.M.M.Malinie Gunarathne, J

I agree,

Appeal IS dismissed.
