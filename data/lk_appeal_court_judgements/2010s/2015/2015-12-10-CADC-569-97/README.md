ARGUED ON : 14th July, 2015

DECIDED ON : 03rd December, 2015

Deepali Wijesundera J.

The plaintiff-defendant has filed an action for declaration of title

and ejectment of the defendant-appellant from the land described in the

schedule to the plaint in the District Court of Polonnaruwa. The

defendant-appellant was absent and unrepresented in court, on the

summons returnable date and the case was fixed for ex parte trial. After

the conclusion of the ex parte trial the decree was served on the

defendant-appellant. The defendant-appellant has filed a proxy and then

has moved for time to file their papers to vacate the ex parte decree.

The learned District Judge after considering the submissions made on

behalf of both parties has refused the defendant-appellant's application

2

stating that the said application did not comply with the mandatory

requirements of the period stipulated in Sec. 86 (2) of the Civil

Procedure Code to purge default for non appearance.

The defendant-appellant in the submissions made to the District

Court has stated that he did not receive the summons sent to him. The

appellants in their application to this court stated that the learned District

Judge had no jurisdiction to quash and nullify or cancel a deed granted

on a "Swarna Bhumi" deed by the President of Sri Lanka. The land in

issue is a land granted by a Swarna Bhumi deed. This grant has been

marked as X.

On perusal of the journal entries in the District Court case record

it can be seen that by the first journal entry itself it has been stated that

summons were served on the defendant, on the next date the case has

been fixed for ex parte trial. The ex parte decree was served on the

defendant-appellant on 20106/1996 according to the fiscal's report.

Journal entry of the case record does not indicate the date the decree

was served, but in the same journal entry it is stated that the defendant

has filed his proxy, journal entry 12 states all these but there is no date

to say on which date all these were submitted to court. There is another

minute which says proxy filed call on 04/10/1996. This journal entry is

very confusing and not clear. By that journal entry after the defendant-

appellant's proxy was filed a date has been given by court without

mentioning for what the date is been given.

The order of the learned District Judge dated 04/06/1997 which

the appellant is seeking to set aside states;

"~ ~ ~ g}J6 E ~ 1996.06.20 E'c! EaJ. ~ ~ ~c! ffJO E'c! 14tJf ~tJ) ~ 1996.07.04 E'c! ~

~ l1aJO 1996.10.04 E'c! ~ t:JaJ E'!KdJ ~ ~ &110

(flZD".

According to his findings the defendant-appellant has filed a proxy

a day after the given date. This filing of the fiscal's report and the proxy

has been done on the same day according to this journal entry. If it is so

then the date should be not 05/07/96 as stated by the District Judge but

01/07/96 as stated by the fiscal's report.

The learned District Judge without going into the documents has

merely depended on the submission of the plaintiff-respondent. There

has been a grave miscarriage of Justice by the District Judge according

to the journal entries. The District Judge himself has accepted the proxy

4

and given a date for the defendant to file his paper, and later gone back

on his own order.

Sec. 86 (3) of the Civil Procedure Code states;

"Every application under this section shall be made by petition

supported by affidavit".

The learned District Judge should have acted under this at the

time he accepted the proxy of the defendant. The District Judge has

misdirected himself and come to the wrong conclusion which in turn has

denied the defendant his rights to intervene in the District Court case.

For the afore stated reason the order dated 04/06/97 of the

District Judge of Polonnaruwa is set aside. The District Court is directed

to allow the defendant-appellant to file his answer. The appellant's

application is allowed.
