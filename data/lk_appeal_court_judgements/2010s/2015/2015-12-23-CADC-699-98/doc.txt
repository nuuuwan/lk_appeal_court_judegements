A.H.M.D. NAWAZ, J, By an initial petition dated 25th September 2013 the 3'd Defendant-Appellant-

Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as lithe Petitioner") sought to relist his appeal

which was dismissed by this court on 12th October 2011. Thereafter an amended

petition dated 30th September 2013 has been filed and the pith and substance of the

prayer are to the following effect;

1) Restatement of the appeal that was dismissed on 12.10.2011;

2) An order to have the brief prepared after the brief fees have been paid by the

Petitioner;

3) An order calling for the record in DC 1920/P from the District Court of Matale

with immediate effect and stay all proceedings in the District Court of Matale.

ORDER OF DISMISSAL ON 12.10.011

When the Court of Appeal proceeded to dismiss the appeal on 1ih October 2011

the Petitioner had been absent and unrepresented, whilst the Plaintiff-Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the lithe Respondent") was represented by

counsel. When this Court peruses the journal entries of this case prior to 1ih

October 2011, the Court finds that on 5th October 2011 the registrar had issued

notices to both parties including the Petitioner and her registered Attorney-at-Law.

In fact when the court made the order of dismissal of the appeal on the next date

1ih October 2011, there was not a tittle of evidence before Court by way of a

notation from the Registrar of the Court of Appeal that notices were not delivered

to the Petitioner and her registered Attorney-at-Law. In other words there was

nothing to indicate that the notices had returned undelivered. It was in those

circumstances that the Court of Appeal proceeded to make its order dated 1ih

3

October 2011 dismissing the appeal. The Court of Appeal stated that the 3rd

Defendant-Appellant (the Petitioner) failed to exercise due diligence to prosecute

the appeal. The Court of Appeal had come to this finding after having looked at the

chronological narrative in the journal entries prior to 1ih October 2011. What is

borne out by the journal entries before 1ih October 2011 could now be set down.

25.5.2011

Issued notices on the Appellant and her regd AAL

Filed this copy.

5.08.2011

Before Anil Gooneratne J

Appellant and the Respondent absent and unrepresented.

Notices have been dispatched only on 2Th July 2011. Registrar is directed to re-

issue notices on both parties and their Registered Attorneys-at-Law.

Mention on 12.10.2011.

5.10.2011

Dispatched notices to both parties and their regd Attorneys by regd post. Filed the

copy.

Regd. Post Nos.441S-4418

The subsequent date was 12th October 2011 when the appeal was dismissed. Thus I

observe that whilst both the Petitioner and Respondent were absent and

unrepresented on Sth August 2011, on the next date 1ih October 2011 the

Petitioner had absented from Court whilst the Respondent was represented before

Court. It was because there was no intimation before Court about the return of

4

1

'.

undelivered notices the Court of Appeal took the view on 1ih October 2011 that the

Petitioner was guilty of due diligence and dismissed this appeal. In this relisting

application the Petitioner asserts that he never got these notices dispatched on 5th

October 2011. That is why he was non est in Court on 1ih October 2011.

The Petitioner asserts in paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 of his amended petition dated 30th

September 2013 that even notices sent on 2ih July 2011 were not delivered to him

and his Attorney-at-Law and these notices were returned to the Court of Appeal and

since the Petitioner managed to get certified copies of these undelivered notices

from the Court of Appeal, they have been appended to this relisting application at

X2.

The delay in making this relisting application to this Court two years after the order

of dismissal is explained by the Petitioner in paragraph 11 of the amended petition.

According to the Petitioner it was during August 2013 when the Petitioner got a

Notice from the District Court of Matale requiring his presence on 1st November

2013 that he came to know that his appeal before this Court had been dismissed.

This Court has given its anxious consideration to ascertain the truth of the assertion

regarding the undelivered notices in view of the averments in the petition that

notices that were undelivered and returned to the Court of Appeal were not notified

to Court when the Court made its order of dismissal on 1ih October 2011. This

court called for a report from the Registrar of this Court who has caused an inquiry

and reported back by his minute dated 14th December 2015 and his information to

this Court has been filed of record. According to the registrar of the Court of Appeal,

the notice sent on 5th August 2011 had been returned on 10th August 2011 and the

notice sent on 1ih October 2011 had also returned on 19th October 2011. The

registrar reports to Court that inadvertently the fact of return of the notices had not

been recorded on the docket.

Thus the conclusion is inescapable that the assertion of the Petitioner as regards the

non delivery of the notices to him is true. When this Court made the order of

dismissal of this appeal on 1ih October 2011, the fact that the Appellant-Petitioner

had not been served with notices of that date was not before Court and if Court had

that requisite information it would not have visited the Appellant-Petitioner with

the sanction of a dismissal as it had done on 1ih October 2011.

This Court draws in aid the salutary principle pronounced by the Supreme Court in

Sivapathalingam v Sivasubramaniam1 to remedy this situation. Justice S.B.

Goonawardene stated in the case what has now come to be accepted as the golden

mean whenever a Court finds that a particular suitor has suffered injustice on

account of an inadvertent lapse or injury on the part of a Court-

"A Court whose act has caused injury to a suitor has an inherent power to

make restitution. This power is exercisable by a Court of original jurisdiction as

well as by a Superior Court."

This curative power has been recognized and adopted in subsequent cases-vide

Caroline Perera and another v Martin Perera and Anothel and Wimlawathie v

)ayawardene3

I am of the view that the dismissal of the Petitioner's appeal arising from a partition

suit was caused entirely due to the requisite communication about the non delivery

of notices on the Petitioner not being brought to the notice of this Court and this

1 (1990) 1 Sri.LR 378

2 (2002) 2 Sri.LR 1

3 (2004) 3 Sri.LR 110 6

Court is of the view that the explanation for the delay proffered by the petitioner in

making a prompt application for relisting is plausible and acceptable.

In the circumstances I set aside order dated 12th October 2011 dismissing the appeal

and make order restating the appeal for argument.

The Registrar is directed to communicate this order to the District Court, Matale

forthwith and recall the record in DIC 1920/P from the District Court of Matale and

upon receipt thereof in the Court of Appeal, the Registrar is directed to list this

matter to be mentioned for the purpose of fixing this matter for argument.

The application for relisting the appeal is thus allowed.

H.C.J. Madawala, J.
