The four Accused-Appellant in this case were indictment before the High Court of Nuwara Eliya on two

counts for committing the murder of Ramakrishnan an offence punishable under the section 296 of the

Penal Code and voluntary coursing hurt to one Rasaiya an offence punishable under section 315 of the

Penal Code. The said trial was commenced on 220d March 2007 and Prosecution witness number one

had given evidence on that day. All Accused-Appellants were defended by a retained counsel on that

day and the said witnesses' evidence was concluded on the same day and further trial was fixed for the

20th of November 2012.

It is brought to the notice of this court by the counsel who represented all 4 Accused, that the procedure

adduced by the Learned High Court Judge on 20th November 2012 is in violation of the rules of Natural

Justice and also Article 4 of the ICCPR Act No. 56 of 2007. According to the proceedings on 20th

November 2007, the case has come up before a new High Court Judge on that day. Since the case was

.t!t I! I !! Ii it

part heard before the previous High Court Judge, the parties had agreed to adopt the evidence led before

the previous High Court Judge and to proceed with the rest of the case. At the time the said order was

made all 4 accused were represented by the same defence counsel who defended them on the previous

day.

However subsequent to the said order was made and the prosecuting counsel moved to call the other

evidence, defence counsel had informed court that he doesn't have any instruction from the Accused

since none of the accused had met him to give instructions and therefore he requested permission to

withdraw from the case. The court after allowing the application of the defence counsel to withdraw

from the case, assigned a counsel to represent all 4 accused. The said assignment was recorded in the

proceedings at 10.45 am and immediately thereafter at 10.45 am the next witness for the prosecution

was called to give evidence. According to the submission made by the counsel for all 4 accused, the

entire persecution case was concluded on the same day leading the evidence of the two lay witnesses

Judicial Medical Officer who conducted the post mortem of the deceased person, the Medical Officer

who examined the injured, two Investigating Officers and finally leading the evidence of the Officiate

Registrar of the High Court. Thereafter further trial was put off for 220d November 2007 and all 4

accused were remanded until that day. On 220d all 4 accused made dock statements and concluded their

cases. Based on the above circumstances it was brought to the notice of this court by Learned Counsel

for the Accused-Appellants that the Accused -Appellants were denied of a fair trial by the said conduct

of the Honorable High Court Judge of Nuwara Eliya.

Article 13 (3) of the constitution guarantees a fair trial and the said article reads as follows;

13 (3) any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard, in person or by and Attorney

-at-Law, at a fair trial by a competent court.

Section 4 -1, (b) of the ICCPR Act No 56 of 2007 read as follows;

4-1). A person charged of a criminal offence under any written law, shall be entitled-

b). to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing and

where he does not have any such assistance, to be informed of that right;

In the present case, when the retained counsel withdrew from the case the Learned High Court Judge

had correctly assigned a counsel to represent them but, whether he permitted the said assigned counsel

to get ready for his case is a matter this court will have to consider at this point. In the case of

Murugaiya Shamila Devi Vs, the Attorney General (CA 262/2009) Her Ladyship Justice Rohini

Marasinghe observed that "assuming that the Accused had requested for an assigned counsel, then the

assigned counsel on behalf of the accused must be afforded the opportunity to prepare the case for the

Accused."

In the case of the Queen Vs, A.K. Peter (1961) NLR 120 Basnayake CJ held that,

"The only ground urged by learned counsel for the appellant is that when the trial commenced on 20th

January the accused's counsel who had been retained by him did not appear, and that at 11 am on that

day counsel was assigned to defend the accused and the case was taken up for trial at 12.30 pm. It is

submitted by Learned Counsel for that appellant that the time allowed for assigned counsel to prepare

the case was not sufficient. He has drawn our attention to the fact that the defence was gravely

prejudiced by the situation in which assigned counsel was placed. We agree that assigned counsel should

be allowed sufficient time for the preparation of his case and for obtaining instructions from the accused.

In the instant case sufficient time was not allowed."

In the present case the Learned High Court Judge after assigning in the counsel, had proceeded to

take up the trial without giving any opportunity for the assigned counsel to get ready in this case.

There is no material before us to show whether the copy of the indictment was served on the assigned

counselor not. A.;; pointed out by me earlier the evidence of two lay witnesses, two doctors, two police

officers and the officiate registrar were concluded on the same day. Considering all these issues I

conclude that the Learned High Court Judge had failed to afford a fair trial to the accused in this case.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General who represented the Attorney General did not contest this matter

and I appreciate the position taken up by state in this case.

For the reasons adduced above I set aside the conviction and sentences imposed by Learned High Court

Judge on all 4 accused-appellants and order a fresh trial before a different High Court Judge.

Appeal allowed.
