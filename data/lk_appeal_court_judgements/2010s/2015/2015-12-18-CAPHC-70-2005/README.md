CASE NO- CA (PHC) -70-2005- JUOGMENT-07.12.2015

P.R.Walgama, J

The instant appeal lies against the order of the Learned High

Court judge dated 01.04.2015, by which order the application of

the Petitioner was dismissed.

The Petitioner by his application to the High Court Holden at

Kandy made an application for a mandate In the nature of a

writ of Certiorari to quash the notice to quit marked as P32,

and for a writ of Prohibition restraining the 1 st and the 2nd

Respondents, from taking any step to eject the Petitioner from

the subject land.

The facts germane to the instant application are as follows;

The Petitioner was employed by the Co operative Society of the

Ounsinane Estate of Pundaluoya and he had purchased shares

of the said estate. In the year 1981 the above Co operative

Society was dissolved and the Petitioner was allowed to

maintain a canteen for the purpose of selling tea.

2

I I i ! The Petitioner was in the said business from 1983 to 1991

and living In the above premIses with his family, while

working as a watcher.

The 151 and the 2nd Respondents had sent two letters in terms

of Government Quarters Recovery of Possession Act No. 06 of

1969, and pursuant to the afore said letters the Respondents had

sent a quit notice marked as P32, in terms of State Land

Recovery of Possession Act.

It is to be noted that the 2nd Respondents originally issued a

quit notice dated 30.01.2003, to the Petitioner under Government

Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act NO.7 OF 1969. but

subsequently a quit notice was issued under Section 3 of State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1969.

The ground norm of the argument of the Petitioner was that

the subject land does not belong to the State, but owned by

the Elpitiya Plantation ltd., and therefore it IS alleged by the

Petitioner that the notice to quit marked as P32 sent by the

Respondents is not valid, as the Respondents did not have the

authority to send the same. But it is to be noted, that the said

Plantation Company was formed under the provisions of Public

Corporations and Government Owned Business Undertakings in to

Public Companies Act No. 23 of 1987, continues to be a State

Land.

It IS contended by the Respondents that the disputed land

belongs to the State and according to the Thirteenth .# Amendment AeeAQ~d.. to the Constitution, Article 154(p)( 4 )(b)

although the High Court is empowered to issue Writs it could

3

I

! ! I I I

do so only regarding the subjects which are devolved In the

Province and more fully stated in the Provincial Council List.

In considering the facts stated above the Learned High Court

Judge was of the VIew that the High Court of Provinces are

barred from issuing Prerogative Writs, in respect of any matter

which is not within the Province.

It is apparent from the Article 154(p) (4) (b) that

Any statutes made by Provincial Council established for that

provInce,

In respect of any matter set out In the Provincial Council

List.

According to the Nineth Schedule List I (Provincial Council

List), Article 18 deals with the Issue of lands, and states thus;

'Land, that IS to say, rights

transfer and alienation of land,

In or over land, land tenure,

land use, land settlement and

land improvement, to the extent set out In Appendix II. '

The above Appendix II specifically deals with the Land and

Land settlement.

'State Land shall continue to vest In the Republic and may be

disposed of in accordance with Article 33 (d) and written Law

governing the matter.'

In the above setting the Learned High Court Jadgc v.as cf ~h;;

VIew that the High Court is barred in issuing a Prerogative

Writ in respect of Lands as the said subject is vested with

the Centre and not with the Province.

Therefore the Learned High Court Judge was of the view that

the Petitioner is not entitled to challenge the validity of the

said quit notice marked as P32 which was is~ued in te!"~~ 0f

Section 18 of State Land Recovery of Possession Act No. 07

of 1979.

In the said back drop it was held by the Learned High Court

Judge that he is not empowered to issue a Writ of Certiorari

as sought by the Petitioner, and as such has dismissed the

Petitioner~ s application accordingly.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner has appealed

to this Court to have the said order set aside or vacate.

The Petitioner in the instant appeal by assailing the above

order of the Learned High Court Judge has asserted the above

mentioned details and reiterate the following;

That the Petitioner- Appellant (in short the Appellant) has

renovated the disputed premises and was living with his family.

The Respondents had attempted to eject him but the Ceylon

Tamil Congress has intervened and as a result, the Appellant

was able to be in possession of the subject premises.

Pursuant to the aforesaid the Respondents had sent the quit

notice marked as P32, which notice has been challenged by the

Appellant, by way of a writ of Certiorari, in order to quash

the said notice.

The core Issue In the instant matter to be resolved IS whether

the premises in suit IS a State Land or a land now vested

in a private company, to vit: the Elpitiya Plantation ltd.

The counsel for the Petitioner has adverted this Court to the

fact that the Dunsinane Estate IS managed by the Elpitiya

Plantation Company and all the immovable property has been

vested m the said Company, and it IS being managed by

Aitken Spence Plantation Management (pvt) Ltd.,

0he 1 ST Respondent! holding the contrary view has submitted

thus;

That the High Court of Province has no jurisdiction to

entertain an application for writ of Certiorari to quash the

notice to quit, marked P32, issued under State Land (Recovery

of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979, to eject the Petitioner from

the State Land.

The said proposition was enshrined in the recent judgment of

SOLAIMUTTU RASU . VS. THE SUPRINTENDENT STAFFORD

ESTATE- SC Appeal No. 211 2013. Y It is the categorical position of the 1 ST Respondentf that a

Land leased out by Janatha Estates Development Board (JEDB)

to a private Company, formed under the Provisions of

Conversion of Public Corporations and Government Owned

Business Undertakings in to Public Companies Act No. 23 of

1987, continues to be a State Land. It was so held in the case

of CHANDRABOSE .VS. CONSULTANT PLANTATION AND

INDUSTRIES

12.05.2003).

AND OTHERS, (CA Writ 920/2000 C.M.A.

It is also contended by the Respondents, that the Appellant was

runnmg a tea shop maintained by the Co operative Society and

even after the dissolution of the said Co operative the Appellant

had continued to run the business without the permission of the

6

r .

~ Respondents. The Respondents alleget that the said Co operative

Society has infonned the Appellant to hand over the disputed

premises to the Dunsinane Estate by letters marked as P8 and

PIO.

It is salient to note that under the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act, the burden is on the occupier to establish that

he possess the land with a valid permit or any other written

authority.

In the above setting it IS crystal clear that the Appellant's

application is untenable, and devoid of merits and should stand

dismissed.

Accordingly we dismissed the appeal without costs'
