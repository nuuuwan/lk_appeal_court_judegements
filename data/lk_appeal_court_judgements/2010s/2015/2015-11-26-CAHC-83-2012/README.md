H.N.J.Perera, J.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kegalle for committing the murder of one Jemis Waduwawala on the 04.01.2001

thereby committing an offence punishable under section 296 of the

Penal Code. After trial the accused-appellant was convicted and sentenced to death on 24.07.2012. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the accused-appellant had preferred this appeal to this court.

When this matter was taken up for argument before this court the learned Counsel for the accused-appellant confined his submissions in this appeal to a single ground of appeal. The only ground of appeal taken

up at the argument stage by the Counsel for the accused-appellant was that the body of the deceased was not properly identified.

In this case Dr.Thusitha Wijemanna who performed the post mortem has specifically stated that one Sammy Karunaratne, the son of the deceased and the Son-in-Law Piyadasa iddamalgoda identified the body of the deceased before him. It is therefore very clear that the deceased body had been positively identified by the son of the deceased before Dr.Wijemanna. The said Post Mortem report has been marked by the prosecution at the trial as P1. No questions had been put to the Doctor regarding the identification of the body of the deceased by the defence at any stage of the trial. In fact the evidence given by the Doctor at the

trial to the effect that the deceased body was identified by his son and

the Son-in-Law has not been challenged by the Counsel for the accused-appellant at any stage of trial. It is not a ground which has been taken in the Petition of Appeal of the accused-appellant either. It has been taken up for the first time in appeal at the stage of the argument.

The witness Samie Karunaratne has in his testimony clearly stated that

his father was Jamis Waduwawala and he died on 04.01.2001 on his way to the hospital. Further the Doctor had stated that the said son Samie

Karunaratne and the deceased Son-in-Law identified the body of the

deceased as that of Jamis Waduwawala before him at the Post Mortem

held at the Avissawella hospital. The defence had not challenged this position at the time witness gave evidence before the High Court.

In the Indian case of Himachal Pradesh V. Thakurdas (1983) 2 CRI U 1694

at page 1701 it was held that whenever a statement of fact made by a

witness is not challenged in cross-examination it has to be concluded

that the fact in question is not disputed.

In Sarwan Sing V. State of Punjab 2002 AIR Supreme Court 11 3652 at

3656 it was held that:-

lilt is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent had declined to avail himself of the opportunity to cross examine the witness it must follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted."

For the reasons stated I hold that there is no justification in interfering with the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 24.07.2012.

Accordingly I dismiss the appeal.
