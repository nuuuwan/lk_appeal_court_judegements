Order

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J (PICA)

Petitioner has filed this Application seeking inter alia,

a. make an interim order restraining the 3rd Respondent and/or his servants, against

and/or employees from engaging in any development activating in whatever form

including but not limited to any activity likely to alter the physical nature of the

Coastal Zone in any way and including the construction of the buildings and

works, the deposit of the water or other material from outfalls, vessels or by other

means, the removal of sand, sea shells, natural vegetation, sea grass and other

substances, dredging and filling, land reclaiming and mining or drilling for

material, pursuant to the purported permit here in before marked as P-23 until the

final determination of this application.

3

d. issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the purported permit

issued by the 2nd Respondent here in before marked P 23.

This matter was supported for notices on 26.06.2014 and the court decided to issue notices on

Respondents. Counsel for the petitioner reserved his right to support for interim relief at that stage.

The matter went down for number of occasions for objections of the respondents. In the mean time

Petition by way of a motion dated 22nd January 2015 moved court that he be permitted to support

for interim relief, for the reasons set out in the said motion. When the matter came up for support the

interim relief, learned Senior State Counsel who represented the lSI and 2nd Respondents informed

court that the lSI and 2nd Respondents will not take part in the inquiry for interim relief and abide by

the decision of this court.

Petitioner to this application owns a land called Yowunpitiya alias Yonunnepitiya at Kosgoda since

March 1997. He constructed a 4 bed roomed villa in the said land in1999; however the same was

destroyed by Tsunami in 2004.

Thereafter upon obtaining necessary approvals including from the Coast Conservation and Coastal

Resource Management Department (here in after referred to as Coast Conservation Department) he

built a two story, four bed roomed villa, which was named "Saffron and Blue". The management of

the said villa was handed over to a tour operator in the year 2012.

A block of bear land situated between the petitioners land and the shore which was used by the Public

to access the beach, was suddenly fenced off in the year 2012. When the villages protested over this

incident, a concrete road was built outside the land to provide access to the beach by the Pradeshiya

Saba. When made inquiries, the petitioner came to know that the said land was belonging to a temple

in the area, Ganegodalla Rajamaha Viharaya, and the land had been leased out to the 3rd Respondent

by the said Temple for a period of 35 years.

Petitioner's complaint in this case is mainly under the provisions of Coastal Zone, Management Plan

prepared under the provisions of the Coast Conservation Act.

Petitioner has referred in his petition the requirement under section 6 to establish Coast Conversation

and Coastal Resource Management Council (also referred to an Advisory Council) and to formulate a

Coastal Zone Management Plan (also referred to as CZMP) in terms of Section 12 of the said Act.

The CZMP currently in operation is the one prepared in 1997, copy of which is submitted by the

Petitioner Marked P-2.

Petitioner refers to several applications made by the 3rd Respondent to the Coast Conservation

Department which were refused by the said department and finally refers to a document marked P-20

where permission was granted to construct of a two storied Ayurvedic SPA building for a total floor

area of 3021 sq.feet with a setback Variance of 15 m. Paragraph 9 of P-20 reads as follow;

9. Details According to the Criteria for Granting set back Variances

9. 1). Is the proposed development activity strictly limited to the Restricted (soft) Area?

Yes, within the Restricted area

a). coastal Segment under the CZMP;

Balapitiya Wellawatta to Kosgoda River Mouth

Reservation Area -10m

Restricted Area - 25m

Total set back - 35m

b). Requested setback from PVL to the structure - 20m

However according to the CZMP; Permissible uses in the Restricted (soft) Area is set out as follows

under paragraph 6.5.

"It is good management practice to leave the restricted area free from any development

activity. However given prevailing land use patterns, small land parcel sizes and

socioeconomic considerations involving some coastal residents a less rigid management

strategy may be required. Thus, construction of dwellings only will be permitted in the

restricted area, but not commercial structures of any kind. Such dwelling shall however, not

restricted access to and along the beach.

The Director of Coastal Conservation may issue a permit for construction of dwelling houses if

the following criteria are met;

The proposed structure will have a floor area less than 750sq. feet (69.7 m2) and will

have a roof of tile, asbestos or Cadjan. Concrete slabs are not permitted, and

The proposed dwelling house will be used solely for residential purposes and not for

any form of commercial activities.

5

In addition to the above, under paragraph 6.6 criteria for Granting Setback Exemptions and Variances

had been discussed as follows,

Set back Exemptions

An exemption implies a significant deviation from the intent of the set back guidelines stipulated in

this plan. Exemptions will only be granted if public interest (not private) requires it. Exemptions may

be granted to engage in restricted activities within the set back area only if and when the applicant has

demonstrated that;

1. The proposed activity serves a compelling public purpose which provides benefits to the

public as a whole as opposed to individual or private interests; the activity must be one or

more of the following:

An activity associated with public infrastructure such as utility, energy,

communications and transportation facilities;

A water dependent activity that generates substantial economIC gam to the

community; or,

An activity that provides better public access to the shore

2. All reasonable steps will be taken to minimize adverse environmental impact and/or use

conflicts; and

3. There are no reasonable alternative locations for serving the compelling public purpose

stated.

Such an exemption may be granted by the Director only if the Coast Conversation Advisory Council

determines that there are compelling reasons for allowing an exemption and recommends granting it.

When consider the criteria and the set back exemptions discussed above, this court cannot understand

the basis under which the 3rd Respondents request was approved in P-21 and development permission

was granted by P-23. Failure by the 1st and 2nd Respondents to assist this inquiry has created suspicion

on the conduct of the said respondents. The material supplied by the 3rd respondent does not fit in to

any of the criteria set out in the CZMP which is now on operation.

However the 3rd Respondent has filed as 3R16 the Certificate of Conformity with regard to the

construction, the 3rd Respondent was permitted to construct. In contrary the petitioner by way of an

affidavit dated 23rd June 2014 submitted that additional constructions are carried out on the land in

question.

In the absence of clear explanation from the 1st and the 2nd Respondents, who are public officers

entrusted with the implementation of CZMP as to how the set back exemptions are granted to the 3rd

Respondent this court considers that it is the duty of this court to stop any further construction being

carried out, outside the Certificate of Conformity.

In these circumstances court decides to issue an interim order as prayed by the petition in prayer (a) of

the petition, subject to following conditions,

a. 3rd Respondent is not permitted to carry out any further construction/ development work

until the final determination of this case

b. If the 3rd Respondent has already obtained the Certificate of Conformity for the

construction in question, he is permitted to carryon with business he is permitted to do

until the final determination of this case
