Petitioner who has followed a 3 year Pre MD.(Restorative Dentistry) programme had sat for the final

examination in May 2014. Due to several reasons the Petitioner had pleaded in her Petition including

harassment and failure to followed guide lines to conduct of Examination and Guide Lines for conduct

of Examiners, petitioner has preferred an application before Court of Appeal and has prayed inter alia.

"Grant and issue an interim relief preventing the 1st respondent University and the 176th

Respondent conducting the scheduled MD (Restorative Dentistry) Examination until

the final determination of this application," and supported for above relief before us.

In support of the above application Petitioner submitted before us, that the respondents including the

176th Respondent failed to file objections in the present application for nearly five months, but

proceeded to publish the next date of commencement of the Examination in MD (Restorative

Dentistry) for the year 2015 by circular dated 25th February 2015. According to the above circular

(produced marked P-20) the examination will commence on 5th May 2015.

Petitioner further submitted that, after filing the present application, she never expected the Authorities

to proceed with the next examination in MD (Restorative Dentistry). However, Petitioner submitted

that she had applied to sit for the2015 examination even though she is not fully prepared for the said

examination, and therefore moved, either that she be permitted to sit only for Practical- Restorative

Dentistry and case book the two subjects out of nine subject she had come down or to issue an interim

order preventing the 1st respondent University and/or the 176th Respondent conducting the above

examination. Learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for 1st -219th and 221 st_246th

Respondent objected to the grant of the interim relief for several reasons.

According to the Learned Deputy Solicitor General the annual calendar of post Graduate Institute of

Medicine for the year 2015 was issued as far back as on 13th November 2014. In the said Calendar MD

(Restorative Dentistry) Examination is scheduled for 5th May and submitted that the petitioner cannot

plead ignorance of this date when all the arrangements are now finalized.

In support of the above contention the Respondents have produced Documents marked R-22A, letter

of invitation to Dr. Miss Serpil Djemal, Kings College Dental Hospital UK to attend the said

examination as the External Examiner, R22-B letter of confirmation from the said external examiner

R23A minutes of PGIM meeting dated 6th January 2015 and R 23 B a copy of the appointment letter

as examiner for the said examination.

From the above material it is clear that the Respondents have taken all steps to have the examination

commenced on 5th Mayas scheduled in the Annual Calendar.

Circumstances under which interim reliefs are granted by our courts were discussed in a number of

cases such as Billimoria V. Minister of Lands (1978-1979) 1 Sri LR 10, Duwearachchi and another V.

4

Vincent Perera (1984) 2 Sri LR 94 Mahindasoma V. Mithripala Senanayake and others (1996) 1 Sri

LR 180.

This court bears in mind the useful reminder of that celebrated jurisprudence as propounded by Neville

Samarakone CJ in the case of Billimoria V. Minister of Lands, Land Development and Mahaweli

Development and Two Others (1978-1979) I Sri LR 13 that "the interest if justice therefore required

that a stay order be made as an interim measure. It would not be correct to judge such stay order in the

same strict manner as final orders by their very nature must depend a great deal on a judge's opinion

as to the necessity for interim action."

Court of Appeal in the case of Deuwearchchi and another V. Vincent Perera and another (1984) 2 Sri

LR 94 held that the court should be guided by the following principle when granting interim relief.

I will the final order be rendered nugatory if the petitioner is successful

II where does the balance of convenience lie

III will irreparable and irremediable mischief or injury be caused to either party

As admitted by the petitioner before us, one reason for his request for the interim relief is that, the

petitioner never expected the authorities to proceed with the 2015 examination as scheduled in the

2015 examination calendar, but on the other hand petitioner concedes that, if an interim relief is

granted, five other candidates will also be aggrieved by the said order. When compared the loss or

mischief caused, between the petitioner and the five others, we find that an irreparable damage or

mischief will cause to the five others if an interim order is issued suspending the MD (Restorative

Dentistry) Examination until the conclusion of this case, but on the other hand if Petitioner is

succeeded and this court decide to grant relief, (iv) in the prayer to the petition by issuing a mandate in

the nature of writ of Mandamus directing a fresh examination to be conducted as prayed for by the

petitioner, no damage or mischief would cause to him. We are also mindful of the steps taken by the

Authorities including 151 and 1761h Respondents to conduct the examination on 51h May 2015 and if an

interim order is issued at this juncture, 5 days before the examination, everybody interested including

the External and Internal examiners and candidates will lose faith on the examination process.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General raised a further preliminary objection based on the Court of

Appeal (Appellate procedure) Rules 1990 but for the reasons I have discussed above, I see no reason

to entertain a preliminary objection at this stage.

For the reasons discussed above we see no ground to consider issuing an interim relief as prayed by

the petitioner at this stage. Application for interim relief is dismissed.
