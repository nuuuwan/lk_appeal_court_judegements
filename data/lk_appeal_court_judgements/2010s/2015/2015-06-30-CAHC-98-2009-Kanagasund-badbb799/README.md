The Accused-Appellant along with another person had been indicted

before the High Court of Battocaloa on a count of murder. At the conclusion of

the trial, learned High Court Judge had convicted him for culpable homicide

not amounting to murder on the basis of grave and sudden provocation and

imposed a sentence of four years Rigorous Imprisonment. The second Accused

was acquitted after trial. Learned counsel admits that the High Court Judge

was very fair in imposing the said sentence and infact the High Court Judge

had considered the evidence of the wife of the deceased who gave evidence at

the trial demonstrating as to how this incident had taken place. The position

taken up by the witness, was that the accused and the deceased had taken

some liquor together, and thereafter due to some misunderstanding, they have

started fighting each other and the Accused had dealt a blow using a club on

the Deceased. The learned Senior State Counsel appearing for the Attorney

General submits that the learned trial Judge was sympathetic towards the

accused since he had imposed only 4 years Rigorous Imprisonment. Therefore

he submits that he cannot agree for any reduction of the sentence. This court

is not in a position to agree with the submissions of the counsel for the

Accused-Appellant, that a non custodial sentence, warrants in this case. We

are of the view that the learned trial Judge had imposed a lenient sentence on

the Accused. Therefore we are not agreeable to reduce the sentence any

further.

We see no reason to interfere with the conviction and the sentence

imposed by the learned High Court Judge and therefore we dismiss this appeal.

Registrar is directed to return the brief to the High Court of Batticaloa in

order to communicate this order to the Accused-Appellant. Appeal is

accordingly dismissed.

I agree.
