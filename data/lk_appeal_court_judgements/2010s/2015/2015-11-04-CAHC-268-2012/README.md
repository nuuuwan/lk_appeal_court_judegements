Shanaka Ranasinghe PC with P. Padmasiri for the Accused-Appellant.

Accused-appellant is present in Court produced by the Prison Authorities.

Counsel for the accused-appellant submits to Court that in the instant case

the accused-appellant had not been afforded a fair trial. He submits that no

evidence had been led to identify the body of the deceased person in this case.

Although the two witnesses who had identified the deceased's body before the

doctor had been listed, the prosecution had failed to lead the evidence of either

one of those witnesses to identify the deceased's body. He submits that

inadmissible evidence too had been led contrary to Section 25 of the Evidence

Ordinance to the effect that the accused-appellant had confessed to the killing of

the deceased in this case and also the evidence of the police officer too had been

led contrary to the Evidence Ordinance, which had prejudiced to the case of the

accused-appellant and denied him a fair trial. We find that no where in the

judgment the learned Judge referred to the said inadmissible evidence that had

been led in this case and for these reasons Counsel moves that this is a fit and

proper case to send back for a re-trial. Counsel for the respondent too concedes

that inadmissible evidence had been led in this case and therefore moves that the

said conviction be set aside and the matter be referred for a re-trial before the High

Court. Therefore, after considering the submissions and the evidence that had

been led in this case and the judgment, we set aside the conviction and the sentence

of the learned High Court Judge dated 10.12.2012 and order trial de novo before

the present Judge of the High Court of Batticaloa and the present Judge is directed

to hear and dispose of this case as expeditiously as possible.

Appeal allowed. Re-trial ordered.
