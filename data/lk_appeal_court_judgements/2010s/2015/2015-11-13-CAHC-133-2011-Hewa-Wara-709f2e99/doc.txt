Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C., J (PICA)

The matter is taken up for argument today. Counsel

for the accused-appellant has taken up several grounds of appeal

before us.

(1) Whether the learned trial Judge's judgment was contrary

to the law or contrary to the evidence led at the trial.

(2) Learned trial Judge failed to identify the importance of

the medical evidence and specially in the case of rape

the independent corroboration was the medical evidence.

(3) Did the learned trial Judge correctly apply the test of

probability, credibility and spontaneity when deciding

the credit worthiness of the evidence gIven by

prosecutrix and her mother.

(4) Learned trial Judge had not properly evaluated the

evidence gIven by the prosecution witnesses to come to

the decision that the prosecution have not been proved

the charge of rape beyond reasonable grounds.

The prosecutrix in this case Ganga Hasaanthi Kodagoda

was 10 years when she was raped by the accused-appellant namely

Hewa Waravitage Sumith alias Manju who is her mother's sister's

son. This incident had taken place on 29.09.1998 at Tumbowila,

Piliyandala. According to the prosecutrix version, the prosecutrix

and the accused were living in adjourning houses and the day in

question around 10 a.m. in the morning the accused called her by

her pet name and wanted her to bring some tea leaves. She went

home took some tea leaves from her mother and came to the

accused's house in order to give him tea leaves. At that time the

accused was in the front room and when she went to him with the

tea leaves he wanted her to keep it on the table. When she was

about to leave the house after keeping the tea leaves on the table the

accused had hit on her head and pulled her into a room and thereafter

pushed her on to a bed, removed the under pant she was wearing

and after removing his clothes got on to her body and raped her.

She explained in her evidence as to how the said act took place in

detail and thereafter hearing the VOice of her mother the accused

had released her. Even though she complains of pam m her private

parts she says that she did not see anything on her body thereafter.

When she came out she saw the mother near the fence and she

immediately complained to her mother of the incident. Thereafter

the mother had scolded the accused and went to the house of the

accused's sister and after complaining her the incident, went to

\

\

Piliyandala Police Station around 12.00 noon. The girl was

examined by the Medical Officer on the same day around 4.00 p.m.

According to the evidence of Doctor Senanayake the Medical

Officer, he had not observed any external mJurIes

on her body but observed very small tare which was about 2 mili

4

meters at 5 0' Clock position and also observed redness around the

said injury. We observed that a prompt complaint had been lodged

at the Police Station and the medical evidence corroborates the

version given by the prosecutrix. Even though the Counsel for the

accused-appellant brought to the notice of Court certain contradictions

inter se with the prosecutrix and her mother, specially with regard

to the clothes she wore at that time, this Court is not inclined to

take them as serious issues since a girl who was only ten years at

that time is not expected keep everything in her memory for so

long. The girl was 21 years of age when she was giving evidence.

However the Counsel for the accused-appellant failed to submit any

material contradiction in this case. Under these circumstances we see

no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned High Court

Judge. We see no merit in the four grounds of appeal raised by the

Counsel for the accused-appellant. Therefore we are not inclined to

interfere with the decision of the learned trial Judge. The appeal is

accordingly dismissed. However considering the fact that the

accused was in remand custody since the time of his conviction and

also considering the age of the accused we decide to make order to

operate the said sentence of ten years R.I. already imposed, from

the date of conviction i.e. with effect from 18.01.2011. Rest of the

sentence will remain unchanged. Subject to the above variation the

appeal stands dismissed.
