A.H.M.D. NAWAZ, J,

In all the appeals before us namely CA 251/12, CA 252/12, CA 253/12, CA 254/12, CA

255/12, CA 256/12, CA 257/12, CA 258/12, CA 259/12, CA 260/12, CA 264/12, CA

265/12, 266/12 and CA 267/12 identical issues arise on sentences that have been

imposed upon the Accused-appellant by the High Court Judge of Vavuniya.

Before I proceed to dispose of these appeals against the sentences imposed on the

Accused-appellant in the cases, let me narrate the facts and circumstances of these

cases. There were 14 indictments that were filed against the Accused-appellant in the

High Court of Vavuniya and each indictment had distinct counts charging the accused

with criminal misappropriation under Section 386 of the Penal Code. A compendious

table containing the number of cases, the names of victims, the dates of commission

of offences and the amount misappropriated along with the sentences that have been

imposed on each count upon the plea of the Accused-appellant is more fully set out

below:-

As is apparent the money misappropriated on each count was a sum of Rs. 20,000/-

which had been entrusted in terms of the indictment to the Accused-appellant for the

purpose of being disbursed to individual dependents of police officers who had

passed away in the battle. I have to observe that it is only through the indictments

and the written submissions filed by the learned Deputy Solicitor General that this

Court is able to gather the facts and circumstances that led to the indictments.

5

I -I

I I I I

In terms of the written submissions filed on behalf of the Attorney General before

this Court, it is asserted that at the material time the accused-appellant had been a

clerk at the office of the Superintendent of Police, Vavuniya. Since 1995 she had been

entrusted with the task of compiling files pertaining to pension and compensation

payable to police officers. When a police officer came by his death in a contingency

such as a war at the material time, the government would make a payment of Rs.

20,000/- for funeral expenses.

In the event of such an eventuality the Chief Clerk of the office would check the

relevant documents, prepare cheques and hand them over to the accused-appellant

for making payments. It was the responsibility of the accused-appellant to disburse

the cheques to the dependents of the deceased police officers. The relevant

indictments were forwarded against the accused-appellant because investigations

revealed incriminatory material that the accused-appellant had misappropriated the

monies to herself without distributing them to the dependents of the deceased police

officers who had passed away under tragic circumstances in the war.

In other words the charges in the 14 indictments against the accused-appellant were

premised on the basis that she had misappropriated the funds assigned for the

funeral expenses of the deceased police officers and as a result of the act of the

accused-appellant, the dependents of the respective police officers were each

deprived of a sum of Rs. 20,000/- that was meant to be utilized for the purpose of

funeral expenses.

As the aforesaid table in this judgment indicates, the dates of commission of all these

offenses happen to fall in the year 1988 and the victims numbering 38 as named in

6

\ I I

the 38 counts of the fourteen cases are said to have been deprived of Rs. 20,000/-

each resulting in a loss to the State of a sum of Rs. 760,000/- cumulatively.

Initially the Attorney General had indicted the accused-appellant in the High Court of

Vavuniya on each count for the offence of criminal misappropriation coupled with an

offence against public property - offences punishable under Section 386 of the Penal

Code to be read with Section 5(1) of Offences against the Public Property Act No. 12

of 1982 as amended by the Act No. 76 of 1988.

The accused-appellant was served with the indictment on 8th September 2004 and

thereafter this case had been called on several dates until 12th July 2012 when the

accused-appellant indicated to Court that she had deposited the relevant amount

specified in the respective indictments. In other words there had been restitution of

the moneys that had been misappropriated. Subsequent to these restitutionary

payments the cases had come up on 11th September 2012 when the State Counsel

moved to amend the indictment under Section 167 (1) of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act to have the offences against the Public Property Act withdrawn. The

effect ofthese amendments was that the Accused-appellant had to face only offences

under Section 386 of the Penal Code. Consequently the accused-appellant pleaded

guilty to the amended indictments on 4th October 2012, whereupon the learned High

Court Judge had proceeded to convict the Accused-appellant on the plea so recorded.

Thereafter the counsel for the accused-appellant had made submissions in mitigation

of the sentence and the State Counsel in reply left the question of sentence to the

discretion of the High Court Judge without having made barely any submissions on

the facts.

7

Conviction and Sentence

On the same day as the plea was tendered on 4th October 2012, the Learned High

Court Judge convicted the accused-appellant and imposed a sentence of 6 months'

rigorous imprisonment on each count in the individual indictments with a fine of Rs.

1,500/- in default of which a term of 3 months' rigorous imprisonment was ordered.

The imprisonment of 6 months on each count in the different indictments was to run

concurrently. For instance the indictment in case no. 1839/04 which gave rise to the

appeal CA 251/12 had two counts of criminal misappropriation of Rs. 20,000/- each

in respect of two victims and the sentence of 6 months' rigorous imprisonment on

each count would run concurrently. All in all the accused-appellant faced 14

indictments, each containing two or more counts of criminal misappropriation

involving 38 victims and on each indictment, regardless of the number of counts of

criminal misappropriation, the learned High Court imposed 6 months' rigorous

imprisonment on each count but they would run concurrently. Cumulatively the total

of 6 months' concurrent imprisonment on each indictment would aggregate to 84

months' rigorous imprisonment since there were 14 indictments (6 months x 14) and

it is significant that the accused-appellant pleaded guilty to all 14 amended

indictments on the same day namely 4th October 2012. The fine of Rs. 1,500/- each

on 38 counts would aggregate to Rs. 57,000/- payable by the accused-appellant with

the default sentence of 3 months' rigorous imprisonment. This is the sentence that

has been appealed against.

Before I deal with the propriety of this sentence it becomes necessary to comment

on the trajectory of these cases in the High Court of Vavuniya.

. .. -

-.. -Progress of the 14 indictments in the High Court

In the instant cases the respective indictments were served on the accused-appellant

on 8th September 2004. The cases had been called on several dates with no initiative

on the part of either the prosecution or defence to begin the trial or terminate it and

as if some belated wisdom dawned, on 12th July 2012 there is a journal entry to the

effect: "Accused pays Rs. 40,000/- Registrar HCV-Credit the money under this case

number."-please see JE of 12.07.2012 in case no. 1839/04 (CA/2S1/12).

The repayment of the misappropriated sums of money resulted in a joint motion of

both the State Counsel and the Defence Counsel to have the case called on 11th

September 2012 when the Defence Counsel notified the High Court that the funds

misappropriated had been deposited whereupon the State Counsel gave notice of his

intention to amend the indictment.

When the case was next called on 4th October 2012 the State Counsel withdrew the

counts on offences against Public Property but retained the charges of

misappropriation under the Penal Code.

What strikes this Court as empty as Mother Hubbard's cupboard is the bare statement

of the State Counsel that he would leave the sentence to the High Court with nary a

word on the facts surrounding the case. No doubt the sentencing belongs to the

domain of the trial judge but that is no ground for the prosecuting counsel to be

complacent about his role in responding to the mitigatory plea of a defence counsel.

As D.P.S.Gunasekera J observed in The Attorney General v Mendis1flwhilst plea

bargaining is permissible, sentence bargaining should not be encouraged at all and

1 (1993) 1 SrLLR 138

t

~ .

.. -must be frowned upon. No trial judge should permit and encourage a situation where

the accused attempts to dictate or indicate what sentence he should get or what

sentence he expects. 1/

No doubt there might have been plea bargaining that took place between the

prosecution and defence. Otherwise the amendment of the indictment lessening the

severity of the charges could not have come about in the wake of the deposit of

moneys that took place 8 long years after the service of indictment. If the repayment

and restitution were the triggers to an amendment, the prosecuting counsel must

have said so in his submissions. This failure on the part of the prosecuting counsel

has led to the counsel for the accused-appellant to contend before us that the High

Court Judge had not taken any cognizance of the repayment of the ill-gotten gains by

the accused-appellant.

Duty of the Prosecuting Counsel

If the prosecutor gives the defence a discount by way of an amendment of the

indictment in exchange for a guilty plea and restitution, which is of course a laudable

approach on the part of the prosecution, that should not be a matter left for the Court

of Appeal to infer. It is advisable that the State Counsel makes a clean breast of it on

the record so that the Court is apprised that the State has awarded a discount in

respect ofthe charges in exchange for a guilty plea. In the absence of such information

either in the submissions of the State Counselor in the order of the learned High

Court this Court has to navigate through the labyrinth so to speak and gather from

the conduct of the parties that the repayment of the ill gotten money on the part of

the accused-appellant has indeed provoked an amendment. Neither does the plea in

10

-.

;. -mitigation help us either as nowhere in that submission before the High Court of

Vavuniya repayment is relied upon as a ground for lessening of punishment.

I would like to observe that a bare statement to the learned High Court Judge that

sentencing is best left to her/him is hardly the approach that should be followed by

prosecuting counsel when confronted with a plea by an accused.

The State Counsel also bears an obligation as the representative of the Attorney

General to set down for the record the facts and circumstances that gave rise to the

respective counts in the indictments. In the absence of such a narrative of facts before

the High Court it would not be possible for the High Court Judge to fully appreciate

the nature of the offence committed by the accused as otherwise the learned High

Court Judge would have only the plea in mitigation made by Counsel for the accused-

appellant. When the propriety of the sentence is challenged before the Court of

Appeal, there would be sparse material for Court to exercise its power of review if

some narrative of facts has not been set down on the record. So a state counsel

cannot stand as a mute bystander merely because the accused is willing to bring to a

close a trial upon a voluntary plea.

Undoubtedly when an accused pleads guilty to the indictment, Section 58 of the

Evidence Ordinance comes into operation requiring no further proof of any fact in any

proceeding which would come to an end upon the conviction and sentence of the

accused. Be that as it may, in view of the extensive submissions that are usually made

by counsel for the accused subsequent to a plea, it is incumbent on the prosecutor to

set out the salient features of the case to the High Court Judge so that even this Court

which is possessed of the power of review of the sentence would be better placed to

11

l I

I I

. -.

embark upon its power having regard to the submissions made by both the

prosecutor and the defense counsel.

Therefore, this Court holds that ex abundanti cautela it is prudent for prosecuting

counsel to bear in mind the obligation to make submissions on matters that impact

on the exercise of the sentencing discretion of the High Court Judge.

In any event let me hasten to add that this failure on the part of the prosecutor as has

happened in this case would not preclude the appellate court from taking cognizance

of the submissions proffered by both the counsel for the State and the Accused-

appellant in order to assess the propriety of the sentence that has been imposed by

the High Court judge.

Before I pass on to the rival submissions to assess the merits of this appeal, I would

like to set down the law within which the jurisdiction to review sentences in appeal

subsists.

Right of Appeal and Forum Jurisdiction

It is trite law that where an accused has pleaded guilty to the indictment an appeal

would not lie against the conviction but against the sentence or it would lie where

the appeal bears upon a question of law.

Section 14 (b) of the Judicature Act No 2 Of 1978 is explicit on this position;

Any person who stands convicted of any offence by the High Court may appeal

there from to the Court of Appeal

(a) ............................................. .

. .".

f

J I

~)

I I

" ..... (b) In a case tried without a jury, as of right, from any conviction or sentence

except in the case where -

(i) the accused has pleaded guilty: or

(ii) the sentence is for a period of imprisonment of one month of whatsoever

nature or a fine not exceeding one hundred rupees

Provided that in every such case there shall be an appeal on a question of law

or where the accused has pleaded on the question of sentence only.

So Section 14 (b) of the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 has set down the parameters of

review by this Court-Post conviction upon a plea to an indictment, the appeal will only

focus on a question of law or the sentence. In fact the adequacy or otherwise of the

sentence passed by the High Court Judge would by itself amount to a question of law

if the sentencing discretion has been exceeded by the High Court Judge or the

sentence is impugned as disproportionate to the offence committed.

So much for the right of appeal available to an accused who has pled to the indictment

and the forum jurisdiction to entertain such appeal is no doubt traceable to Article

138 of the Constitution as it is axiomatic that the constitutional conferment of the

appellate power on this Court in Article 138 does not per se give the accused a right

of appeal and the bestowal of the right of appeal has to be statutory.2

The Two Principal Sources

Legislation and judicial decision are the two principal sources of guidance on

. .... sentencing in Sri lanka and it is relevant to observe that many a country has adopted

Sentencing Guidelines whose merits and demerits continue to be debated in those

jurisdictions.3 In regard to fraud offences for instance, the Sentencing Council of

England which was created by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 bought into

operation on pt October 2014 Sentencing Council's, Fraud, Bribery and Money

Laundering Offences Definitive Guideline and there are a number of countries4 which

have adopted sentencing guidelines in the hope there would be consistency and

flexibility given the complex challenges encountered by sentencers. These debates

have to be taken into account before Sri Lanka proceeds to adopt sentencing

guidelines, subject of course to a consultative process.

As for review of sentences in Sri Lanka one has to have regard to the statutory

provisions in place and case law. I would now set out the relevant statutory provisions

and the judicial decisions that impact on the sentencing discretion.

Section 13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 stipulates that:-

"The High Court may impose any sentence or other penalty prescribed by

written law".

In the instant case the said sentence or penalty prescribed by written law is found in

section 386 of the Penal Code.

3See for instance A. Lovegrove, "The Sentencing Council, The Public's Sense of Justice, and Personal Mitigation" (2010) Crim.LR 906; See the comment on this by Julian B.Roberts, Mike Hough and Andrew Ashworth, "Personal Mitigation, Public Opinion and Sentencing Guidelines in England and Wales" (2011) Crim.LR 524 and the response thereto by A.Lovegrove, "There are more things in the Public Sentencing than in Your Philosophy: A Response to Roberts, Hough and As worth" (2011) Crim.LR 531.

44Besides the US, guidelines have been introduced in South Korea, Uganda and the Republic of Fiji Islands and proposed in several other countries.

14

, - -. . ' . Section 386 of the Penal Code reads as follows:-

"Whoever, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any movable

property shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term

which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both"

The Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 is rife with provisions relating to

sentences.

By an amendment made to the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 in

19995, the legislature laid down guidelines which a court must bear in mind, before

such court decides to suspend a sentence upon conviction.

Section 303 of the Code as amended reads thus:-

303.(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, on sentencing an offender to a term

of imprisonment, a court may make an order suspending the whole or part of the

sentence if it is satisfied, for reasons to be stated in writing, that it is appropriate to

do so in the circumstances, having regard to;

a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence in respect of which the

sentence is imposed;

b) the nature and gravity of the offence;

c) the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;

d) the offender's previous character;

:-. criteria before suspending a sentence, in my view these are some of the factors that

constitute legislative guidelines to judges even when they utilize their discretion to

sentence an accused to a punishment stipulated in the Penal Code or any other

criminal statue. These criteria are not limited to suspended sentences alone and will

apply in any situation where a judge wishes to impose a custodial sentence. This non-

exhaustive list of factors, though prescribed by the legislature in 1999, reflect the

jurisprudence that has been echoed by appellate courts over a long period of time.

Some of those case law which gave rise to the legislative formulae in Section 303 (1)

(a) to (I) are worthy of mention.

As to the matter of assessing sentence in a particular instance, Basnayake A.C. J in the

case of Attorney-General v H.N. de Silva6 observed as follows:-

" ... in assessing the punishment that should be passed on an offender, a Judge

should consider the matter of sentence both from the pOint of view of the

public and the offender. Judges are too often prone to look at the question only

form the angle of the offender. A Judge should, in determining the proper

sentence, fi rst consider the gravity of the offence as it appears from the nature

of the act itself and should have regard to the punishment provided in the

Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is charged. He should

also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent and consider to what

extent it will be effective. If the offender held a position of trust or belonged

to a service which enjoys the public confidence that must be taken into account

in assessing the punishment. The incident of crimes of the nature of which the

offender has been found to be guilty and the difficulty of detection are also

matters which should receive due consideration. The reformation of the

.- . criminal, though no doubt an important consideration is subordinate to the

others I have mentioned. Where the public interest or the welfare of the State

(which are synonymous) outweighs the previous good character, antecedents

and age of the offender, public interest must prevaiL."

After having set out the above indicia, Basnayake A.C.J found fault with the trial judge

for not having taken into his reckoning some of the factors referred to above.

Some of the criteria Basnayake A.C.J alludes to in the passage quoted above are

mirrored in the legislative guidelines in Section 303 (l)(a) to (I) of the Code as could

be manifest upon a reading of that section.

In A.G. v Jinak Sri Uluwaduge and Another it was held that:-

" ... .in determining the proper sentence, the judge should consider the gravity

of the offence as it appears from the nature of the act itself and should have

regard to the punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under

which the offender is charged. He should also regard the effect of the

punishment as a deterrent and consider to what extent it will be effective.

Incidence of crimes of the nature of which the offender has been found guilty

and the difficulty of detection are also matters which should receive due

consideration. The Judge should also take into account the nature of the loss

to the victim and the profit that may accrue to the culprit in the event of non-

detection. Another matter to be taken into account is that the offences were

planned crimes for wholesale profit. The Judge must consider the interests of

the accused on the one hand and the interests of society in the other; also

necessarily the nature of the offence committed, the machinations and

7(1995) 1 Sri LR 157

18

r

i

.- . manipulations resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of

committing such a crime insofar as the institution or organisation in respect of

which it has been committed, the persons who are affected by such crime, the

ingenuity with which it has been committed and the involvement of others in

committing the crime ... "

In the case of The Attorney General v MendisB, it was held that in assessing

punishment the judge should consider the matter of sentence both from the point of

view of the public and the offender. The judge should first consider the gravity of the

offence, as it appears from the nature of the act itself and should have regard to the

punishment provided in the Penal Code or other statute under which the offender is

charged. He should also regard the effect of the punishment as a deterrent and

consider to what extent it will be effective. The incidence of crimes of the nature of

which the offender has been found to be guilty and the difficulty of detection are also

matters which should receive the consideration. Two further considerations are the

nature of the loss to the victim and the profit that may accrue to the accused in the

event of non-detection.

Furthermore in that case the court observed that once an accused is found guilty and

convicted on his own plea or after trial, the judge in deciding on sentence, should

consider the point of view of the accused on the one hand and the interest of society

on the other. The nature of the offence committed, the machinations and

manipulations resorted to by the accused to commit the offence, the effect of

committing such a crime insofar as the institution or organization in respect of which

it has been committed, is concerned, the persons who are affected by such crime the

8 See Fn 1 supra

,- -ingenuity with which it has been committed and the involvement of others in

committing the crime are matters which the judge should consider.

D.P.S.Gunasekera J further observed -

"white collar crimes or economic crimes have been committed with impunity in

the past. Hence the sentence passed should be in keeping with the nature and

magnitude of the offence to which the accused has pleaded guilty. 119

Similar principles have been reiterated in Attorney General v Gunarathna10 and the

learned Deputy Solicitor General has also cited in his written submissions the case of

Walgama Kodituwakkuge Ruksiri alias Sudumalli v The Attorney Generap-l.

Recidivism and recalcitrant conduct have to be averted for the greater good of society

and punitive laws that prescribe sanctions for infractions of normative behavior have

to be interpreted to advance the objectives of punishments whose parameters have

been amply set down by the gladsome jurisprudence of the judicial precedents cited

above. In fact some of the indicia such as gravity of the offence, presence of

aggravating and mitigating factors, antecedents of the accused, prevention and

deterrence have long been recognized in English courts.

Classical Principles of Sentencing

Lord Justice Lawton in the case of R v James Henry Sargeanf2 designated them as

classical principles of sentencing and summed them up in four words; retribution,

deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation. The learned Judge stated:-

9 Attorney General v Mendis Fn 1 and Fn 8 supra

10 (1995) 2 Sri.LR 240 per Sarath N.Silva J, PICA llCA/306/2012

12 (1974) 60 Cr.App.R.74

20

...

. .--"Any judge who comes to sentence ought always to have those four classical

principles in mind and to apply them to the facts of the case to see which of

them has the greatest importance in the case with which he is

dealing ......................... .

There is, however, another aspect of retribution which is frequently overlooked:

it is that society, through the courts, must show its abhorrence 0/ particular

types 0/ crime, and the only way in which the courts can show this is by the

sentences they pass ...................................... .

...... ........ I turn now to the element of deterrence, because it seems to us the trial

judge probably passed this sentence as a deterrent one. There are two aspects

of deterrence: deterrence of the offender and deterrence of likely

offenders .................. .

.......... We come now to the element of prevention. Unfortunately it is one of the

facts of life that there are some offenders for whom neither deterrence

nor rehabilitation works. They will go on committing crimes as long as they are

able to do so. In those cases the only protection which the public has is that such

persons should be locked up for a long period ............ 1311

It is pertinent to observe that the counsel for the accused-appellant has also

highlighted in his written submissions that the accused appellant was jailed in two

different cases of the same nature in 2004.

On the question of aggravating and mitigating factors, I consider the process as laid

down. The judges must typically settle on a starting point and adjust the sentence

13 See (1974) 60 Cr.App.R.74 at 75,76, 77 and 78.

21

J

\

~ -for the aggravation and mitigation as appropriate. In an offence such as criminal

misappropriation, the High Court Judge has the discretion of a range of sentences

extending up to a maximum of 2 years and once he has settled on a starting point,

he has to strike a balance between aggravation and mitigation. The balance is the

watchword. He must go up and down the sliding scale based on the aggravating and

mitigatory fadors.

Where there is a legislative guideline as in Section 303 (l)(a) to (I) of the Code which

is, as I have commented above, a mirror image to some extent of long established

judicial guidelines, the sentencer will begin the process of sliding up and down the

scale of aggravation and mitigation by reference to the non-exhaustive list of factors

given in both the legislative and judicial gUidelines. Secondly the sentencers can also

engage in a consideration of any factors deemed relevant by them but not listed in

the guidelines. Other statutory provisions such as sections 16 and 300 of the Code as

commented upon below can also be taken into account.

In the light of this analysis of all the criteria set out above and the classical principles

to be applied in sentencing, what is the resulton the facts of this case? Is the sentence

of 6 months' rigourous imprisonment aggregating to 84 months for 38 counts of

criminal misappropriation in 14 indictments too disproportionate and inconsistent

with the sentencing guidelines of Sri Lanka? The sentence is sought to be impugned

on the following grounds in a nutshell. We will dispose of this question after having

applied the law to the facts in the case.

The Guilty Plea and consideration of the ground of repayment

It has to be recalled that the guilty plea did not come all too soon. The amendment of

charges to lesser offences followed in the wake of repayment 8 long years after

22

\ I I

,. .,.

service of indictment. Why wasn't this repayment made in or around 2004 when the

indictment was served or soon thereafter? Did the Accused-appellant buy time-

virtually a period of 8 years to garner the money and pay it back in 2012? The victims

were all driven back to the wall when the accused-appellant played ducks and drakes

with their money which was really the largess of the State for funeral expenses. If this

money had been paid backjust after arraignment or even so soon thereafter, it would

have been an emollient, if not palliative, to the victims. Eight long years or more

thereafter, it would not lie now in the mouth of the accused-appellant to contend

that her repayment is a virtue.

If at all, the first benefit of a plea of guilty is for victims and witnesses for whom the

knowledge that an accused has accepted her/his guilt reduces the impact of the crime

and avoids the stress of anticipating having to give evidence. The second major reason

for the practice is a more pragmatic one. The expenditure in public time and money

on trials and the preparation for trials is considerable. They are avoided or reduced

by the admission of guilt, so that limited resources could be concentrated on those ,

cases where a trial would really be necessary. t

No doubt Section 197 (2) ofthe Code of Criminal Procedure Act which was brought in

by Amendment Act No. 14 of 2005 is to the following effect-I

"The judge shall in sentencing the accused have regard to the fact that he so

p/eaded.#

A slightly better version of the above provision is found in Section 236 (b) of the

Administration of Justice Law No 44 of 1973 (A.J.L).

23

, "Where any person accused of an offence assists the prosecution by pleading

guilty to the commission of such offence and the court is satisfied that such

person is sincerely and truly repentant/ then that fact shall be taken into

consideration in determining the amount of punishment. N

Though the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 did not re-enact this t

provision, the salutary guideline in the A.J.L provision cannot be altogether lost sight

of in applying the provisions of Section 197 (2) of the Code as introduced by the 2005

amendment. In this connection what the English Court of Criminal Appeal has stated

in R. V Caley and others 14 becomes relevant.

"The well-established mechanism by which the difference between defendants

who required the public to prove the case against them and those who accepted

their guilt was by reducing the sentence which would have been imposed after

trial by a proportion on a sliding scale depending on when the plea of guilty

was indicated. The largest reduction was of about one-third/ which was to be

accorded to defendants who indicated their plea of guilty at the first

reasonable opportunity. Thereafter the proportionate reduction diminished/

and a plea of gUilty at the door of the trial court would attract a reduced

reduction. n

The rationale to be distilled from this case is that sentence discounting generally

operates on the basic principle that the earlier a guilty plea is tendered, the larger size

of the discount, as the benefits to the criminal justice system tend to be greater for

early pleas than for later ones. For comparable observations to this effect in the

14[2012] EWCA Crim 2821

24

~

. .,.

r

Scottish jurisdiction please see Gemmell v HM Advocate15 and Murray v HM

Advocate16.

So the cases establish that a plea of guilty might of course be an indication of remorse,

but it might not be. An accused might regret his offence, or he might plead guilty

because he did not see a way of avoiding the consequences. Discussing the question

of tactical pleas, the English Court of Appeal had this to say in R. v David John

Hollington: R. v George Michael Emmens17

"The idea seems to be getting around that if a defendant ultimately pleads

guilty he is entitled to a very considerable discount on his sentence. This Court

has long said that discounts on sentences are appropriate but everything

depends upon the circumstances of each case. 1/

In light of the above principles of law, what do we make of the sentence discount that

the accused-appellant secured in this case? Despite an unduly belated repayment

which brought about a lessening of very serious charges, the accused-appellant

secured a two fourth reduction of the sentence punishable for criminal

misappropriation. When the English courts prescribe only a one third ofthe maximum

sentence for a timely plea, notwithstanding an inordinately delayed plea this accused-

appellant obtained a reduction by two fourth of the 2 years' term thus having to

undergo only a period of six months' rigorous imprisonment for mUltiple counts in

the individual indictments.

In our collective view, this sentence is in no way disproportionate to the gravity

of the offence that has been committed having also regard to the mitigatory

15 [20111 HCJAC 129; 2012 J.C 223; 2012 S.L. T 484.

circumstances that the accused pleaded before the learned High Court judge.

One of the mitigatory factors that was urged before both the High Court and the Court

of Appeal is that the accused-appellant is the primary earner who maintains both her

elderly mother and an adult daughter who was about to enter holy matrimony in the

not too distant future. It was urged that her incarceration would sever the umbilical

cord. It was always an inevitable consequence of her offence that the accused was

going to be separated from her mother and daughter for a significant period. With

the marriage of the daughter she would no longer be a dependent on the accused-

appellant and though this Court recognizes that the rupture of a relationship with a

dependent may in particular cases amount to a mitigatory factor, the question to pose

would be whether the reduced sentence does reflect the personal factor in J

mitigation.

Furthermore it has to be emphasized that the legitimate aims of sentencing which

have to be balanced against the effect of a sentence on personal mitigation such as

family life includes the need of society to punish serious crime, the interests of victims

that punishments should constitute just deserts and the need of society for

appropriate deterrence. In our view such a balance has been achieved with the

recognition of the plea and repayment by the imposition of concurrent sentences

which stood reduced by two fourth of the maximum.

In fact the fact that the learned High Court Judge has shown benevolence to the

accused appellant cannot be gainsaid. Such an exercise of discretion cannot be

faulted by this Court as an erroneous imposition of an excessive sentence.

Having regard to loss of public funds and the harm caused to 38 victims by a process

of premeditation and covert machinations indulged in by the accused-appellant, the

26

, !

J--delayed reparation in no way attenuates the severity of the offences which the

accused-appellant admitted.

In the circumstances I am of the opinion that the punishment that has been imposed

restores the just order of society which was disrupted by the crime and the fact hardly

needs repetition that retributive justice is predicated on the principle that the

punishment must fit the crime.

So this Court is not inclined to set aside the conviction and sentence imposed in these

cases.

Before I part with the judgment, I would advert to another argument that has loomed

large in the written submissions.

Concurrent and Consecutive Sentences

Sections 16 and 300 of the Code would regulate the imposition of consecutive and

concurrent sentences.

As I have stated above, the learned High Court judge ordered the imprisonment of 6

months on each count to run concurrently so that the accused-appellant has to

undergo only a prison term of 6 months RI on each indictment. Her total term of

imprisonment aggregates to 84 months' RI (7 years' RI) because she pleaded guilty to

14 indictments each carrying a sentence of 6 months' Rio

In fact there could not have been a bar to the learned High Court Judge to have

ordered consecutive terms of 6 months on each count in the individual indictments

as Section 16 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act quite clearly empowers the

High Court Judge to order the punishments to commence, the one after the expiration

of the other but the learned High Court judge chose not to do so and instead

27

II I

ti

I

exercised her discretion namely the discretion to direct that the punishment for each

offence (count) at one trial shall run concurrently with each other.

Thus the accused obtained a further advantage through the exercise ofthis discretion,

when in fact the High Court Judge could have ordered in terms of section 16 of the

Code that the sentences on each count in one indictment shall run consecutively.

As section 16 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act stands, it enacts both a rule

and an exception. The rule is that if there are more than one count in one indictment,

the separate sentences ordered on each count shall run consecutively. But the

exception to the rule as found in the said section is that if the High Court judge

chooses to do so, she/he is empowered to order the separate sentences to run

concurrently. In fact Section 16 (1) a neutral provision which applies to both trials in

the High Court and the Magistrate's Court enacts-

"When a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences

the court may subject to section 301 sentence him for such offence to the

several punishments prescribed therefore which such court is competent to

inflict; such punishments when consisting of imprisonment to commence~ unless

the court orders them or any of them to run concurrently~ the one after the

expiration of the other in such order as the court may direct~ even where the

aggregate punishment for the several offences is in excess of the punishment

which the court is competent to inflict on conviction of one single offence;

Provided that if the case is tried by a Magistrate~s court~ the aggregate

punishment shall not exceed twice the amount of punishment which such court

in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction is competent to inflict. "

28

i II

f \I

f

Provided that if the case is tried by a Magistrate~s court~ the aggregate

punishment shall not exceed twice the amount of punishment which such court

in the exercise of its ordinary jurisdiction is competent to inflict. N

Thus Section 16 of the Code is limited in scope to multiple counts in one trial and the

power of ordering concurrent sentences does not extend to other indictments against

the same accused as they would constitute separate and distinct trials.

In fact Section 300 of the Code reinforces this position.

"When a person actually undergoing imprisonment is sentenced to

imprisonment such imprisonment shall commence at the expiration of the

imprisonment to which he is being previously sentencedN

The Court of Appeal considered the scope of section 300 of the Code in the case of

Muthukuda Arachige Ranjith v the Attorney General18 where Gamini Abeyratne J by

interpreting the worlds "actually undergoing imprisonment" in section 300 of the

Code correctly pointed out that if multiple indictments are taken up on one particular

day and the accused pleads guilty to those indictments one after the other, he actually

commences his imprisonment when she/he is sentenced upon the plea to the first

indictment. Therefore section 300 of the Code would not permit the imposition of

concurrent sentences for the different indictments. This view was also taken by

Gamini Amaratunga J in Weerawranakula v The Republic of Sri Lanka. 19

While I respectfully adopt these decisions, I hasten to point out that not only Section

300 but also Section 16 of the Code would prohibit the imposition of concurrent

sentences for multiple indictments.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General has moved for an enhancement of the sentence

which course this Court is disinclined to take as we opine that there was an

opportunity available to the Attorney General to prefer an appeal against the

sentence which was not availed of. Moreover even if this Court possesses the power

to do so in an appeal preferred by the Accused-Appellant, we do not deem it proper

to adopt that exceptional course in this case, as we are of the view that the sentence

imposed on the Accused-Appellant meets the ends of justice from both the point of

view of the public and the Accused-Appel/ant.

For the reasons I have already given, we are satisfied, having regard to the facts of

this case and the relevant principles of law and criteria governing sentencing, there is

no error committed by the learned High Court Judge and in the circumstances we

affirm the conviction and sentence.

The appeal is thus dismissed.
