Petitioner Petitioner Respondent.

ARGUED ON : 03rd June, 2015

DECIDED ON : 13th November, 2015

Deepali Wijesundera J.

The respondent respondent petitioner (herein after referred to as

the petitioner) has made the instant application to set aside the judgment

( ~ tC CAS fl-entered in this matter dated 10/11/2006 and to relist the t:flatteF for

argument.

The petitioner stated that notices issued by this court was not

received by the petitioner and that the records of the Registry of the

Court of Appeal shows that the notices have been returned, therefore the

petitioner was not aware of the existence of the revision application filed

by the petitioner petitioner respondent (herein after referred to as the

respondent). The petitioner has filed documents marked Y1 and Y2 to

3

prove his argument, but there is no returned envelop with the

endorsement of the post office to say the notice could not be served for a

particular reason, when notices are returned the envelop is filed with the

oJD,,-!] record with the relevant endorsement.

t\.

The argument of the respondent was that the address given in the

notices was the address given by the petitioner in the District Court and

also to the Bank. Respondent argued that the petitioner has evaded

receiving notice. The respondent also stated that the instant application

has been filed by the petitionerIpower of attorney holder who has no

locus standi to make this application.

The respondent argued that under Sec. 771 of the Civil Procedure

Code there is no provision for relisting in a revision application. The

respondents cited the judgments in Jinadasa Vs Sam Silva 1994 1 SLR

232, Kalawane Dhammadassi Thero Vs Mawella Thero 1957 NLR 400

CA(;L~ e.. A,,--d stated that sufficient case- has to be shown to rehear a case. ---

The respondent also stated that there was no prayer for relisting in

the petition and cited the judgments in Surangi Vs Rodrigo (2003) 3

SLR 35, National Development Bank Vs Rupasinghe and others 3

4

..

SLR 92. The respondent further stated that there was no valid affidavit

filed by the petitioner who was in a fit position to sign an affidavit since

the power of attorney was given due to ill health which made it difficult for

fr{~ V~/ the petitioner to come. to court. The respondent also stated that the -power of attorney holder and the Principal both resided in the same

jurisdiction therefore the power of attorney had no locus standi.

The petitioner's counsel stated that although two sets of notices

were sent to the petitioner and returned the Registry has failed to

journalize it, therefore they have filed documents marked X1, X2, Y1 and

Y2 in proof that the notices were not received.

The petitioner citing the judgment in Sivapathalingam Vs

0\N>f Sivasubramaniam 1990 (1) SLR 378 stated that a court whose act has

t--.

caused injury to a suite has an inherent power to make restitution and

that no party should be injured by an act of court.

The petitioner further submitted that this is a case where the

petitioner succeeded in the District Court by judgment date 13/06/2005,

and where the Court of Appeal allows an application setting aside an

5

order of the District Court it should ensure that the other party is noticed

and heard.

The petitioner made this application on the basis that the petitioner

did not have any notice of the Revision application filed by the

respondent as the notices were returned to the registry, but the petitioner

has not stated why the notices have been returned since they have been

sent to the given address in the District Court case and also to the

respondent bank. Documents marked as Y1 and Y2 are photocopies of

some handwritten documents which can not be accepted as a valid

document. There is no entry to say why the notices have been returned.

The usual procedure is to file the relevant envelop with the notices to the

.-y~"rc/ case Ae8rd with the endorsement of the post office stating the notices

could not be served for a particular reason.

Section 771 of the Civil Procedure Code states thus:

When an appeal is heard ex parte in the absence of the

respondent, and judgment is given against him, he may apply to

the Court of Appeal to rehear the appeal; and if he satisfies the

court that the notice of appeal was not duly served, or that he

was prevented by sufficient cause from attending when the

appeal was called on for hearing, the court may rehear the

appeal on such terms as to costs or otherwise as the court thinks

fit to impose upon him.

i I I

..

Although there is no specific provision in the Civil Procedure Code

and the Supreme Court rule~for relisting of an application for Revision

the court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction in limited exceptional

circumstances to set aside its own considered orders, on questions of

law. In the instant application the petitioner failed to state why the notices

sent twice to the given address were not received. If the petitioner

received communications to the address stated in the District Court case

and to the respondent Bank why were the notices sent by this court not

received. Although the documents Y1 and Y2 indicate the notices were

returned no return notice had been filed in the record and no entry had

been made to say so.

For the afore stated reasons we see no merit in the application of

the petitioner to relist the application for Revision. The application for

relisting is refused.
