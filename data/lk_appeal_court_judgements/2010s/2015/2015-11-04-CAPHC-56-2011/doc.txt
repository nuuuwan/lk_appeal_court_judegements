P.R.Walgama, J

The Learned Magistrate of Primary Court of Nuwara

Eliya, has sent the notice and the charge sheet which

are undated, to the Petitioner - Respondent to appear III

Court to reply the charges against him

misrepresenting facts III the affidavits and doing so

tendered a false affidavit to Court on 13.02.2001

31.05.2001, which amounts to a contempt of Cmlrt.

The Respondent -Petitioner by his affidavit

03.03.2006, has stated thus;

for

has

and

dated

That the Petitioner -Respondent instituted action against

the Respondent - Petitioner III terms of Section 66 of the

Primary Court Act No. 44 of 1979, and moved inter

alia for the relief for an interim injunction to prevent

Respondent -Petitioner from constructing a parapet wall

and to remove the gate that has obstructed the path

way of the Petitioner - Respondent.

It IS the contention of the Respondent -Petitioner that

the facts stated In the Affidavit of the Petitioner-

Respondent is not truthful and trustworthy.

It IS also stated by the Respondent - Petitioner that after

his complaint to the Nuwara eliya Police regarding the

above said affidavit tendered by the Petitioner Respondent, an

indictment was filed against the Petitioner - Respondent In

the High Court of Badulla.

In the above setting it IS said that the Petitioner- Respondent

should be dealt in terms of Section 183 (b) and in terms of

Chapter LXV of the Civil Procedure Cade for contempt of

Court.

As I had stated above, after the Respondent Petitioner tendered

the affidavit the Learned Primary Court Judge has made an

order dated 28.04.2003, as to whether summons should be issued

to the Petitioner-Respondent, taking into consideration of the

section below.

Section 183(b)

"where any person willfully makes any false statement by

affidavit or otherwise, in the course of any of the proceedings

aforesaid he may be punished as for a contempt of court,

besides his liability to be tried and punished under the Penal

Code for the offence of gIvmg false evidence, which such

statement IS on oath or affirmation".

Section 78 of the Primary Court Act states thus;

"If any matter should arise for which no provision IS made in

this Act, the provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

governmg alike matter where the case or proceeding IS a

criminal prosecution or proceeding and the prOVISIOns of the

Civil Procedure Code governing alike matter where the C2.se IS

a civil action or proceeding shall with suitable adoptions as the

justice of the case may require be adopted and apply."

The Learned District Judge who has acted under the Primary

Court Act was of the VIew, as there is an indictment filed III

the High Court for the same charge, there IS no basis to

charge the Petitioner- Respondent in terms of the above section

of the Civil Procedure Code. Therefore the Learned District

Judge who exercised the jurisdiction of the Primary Court was

of the view that there is no basis to issue summons to the

Petitioner - Respondent.

Aggrieved by the said order the Respondent Petitioner came by

way of Revision to the High Court to have the said order set

aside and proceed to Issue summons on the Petitioner-

Respondent accordingly.

In the above application III Revision to the High Court, the

Respondent - Petitioner had urged the following reliefs; To dismiss

the. order of the Primary Court Judge dated 28.04.2005 and or

to revise the said,. order,

To order the Primary Court to issue summons III the Case

bearing No. 61765 to the Respondent and to proceed further for

necessary action.

The Learned High Court Judge by his ordc~ dated 05.07.2006

had observed the following;

That the Petitioner has made the application III terms

of Section 183(b) read with Chapter LXV of the Civil

Procedure for contempt of Court, and the said

application has been made by a party to this action.

Therefore according to the above Section, such

application could be made by a person who IS not a

party to an action, and therefore the Petitioner cannot

maintain this application.

In the above setting it was held that the application

made by the Petitioner IS bad III law, and as such

the Learned High Court Judge was of the VIew that

there IS no reason to interfere with the decision of

the Learned Primary Court Judge, and had dismissed the

application of the Petitioner accordingly.

5

Thereafter the Respondent- Petitioner made an application to this

Court.

By Revision to have the said impugned order of the

Learned High Court Judge be set aside and to make

order to Issue summons to the Petitioner - Respondent.

Their lordships by the order dated 15.01.2009, had set aside

the impugned order of the Learned High Court of

Kandy dated 05.07.2006. Further has ordered that the High

Court Judge should InqUIre into the Issue of "double

jeopardy" afresh and make an appropriate order.

Pursuant to the afore said order, the Learned High Court

Judge has inquired in the application of the Petitioner and

had made order, dismissing the order of the Primary Court

Judge dated 28.04.2005, and to Issue summons on the

Respondent In case No. 61765 In the PrimarY

oi Court of

Nuwaraeliya, and proceed as per petition tendered by the

Respondent- Petitioner, accordingly.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Respondent-

Petitioner has come by way of Revision to have

the said order set aside or be vacated.

The Learned High Court Judge has adverted to the

case of BROWN & COMPANY LTD .VS.

ADHIKARIARACHCHI, LABOUR OFFICER AND ANOTHER

(1984) 1 SLR- 220 which has been observed thus;

"Our Code of Criminal Procedure Act recogmzes the

plea of autrefois acquit or autrefois convict only to the

limited extent set out In Section 314 of our Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No." 15 of 1979.

Section

and

aforesaid

provides thus, person who has

of Competent jurisdiction for an

acquitted of such offence shall

to be tried again for the same offence."

"It IS therefore perfectly clear that In

to be

law for the

principle of double jeopardy

Respondent should have been

by a court of competent

(emphasis added)

applicable the

either convicted or acquitted

jurisdiction after trial."

It was also observed by Their Lordships that the Respondent

has never claimed that he had been either convicted or

acquitted by any court of law.

In the exposition of the law and thereto the Learned High

Court Judge was of the view that the Respondent has not

7

i i

~ r

been punished by any court of law and as such the principle

of double jeopardy will not be applicable In this

situation.

Being

Thus the Appellant moves this Court to set aside the

order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 19.05.2011,

and affirm the order of the Learned Primary Court Judge,

dated 28.04.2005.

The Counsel

doctrine of "double jeopardy", will not be

this instance as there IS no acquittal or

conviction regarding the afore said charge, but nevertheless

there IS an indictment against the Petitioner -Respondent-

Appellant.

~ tf It! ,I,

It is a salutary principle that a person cannot be charged

for the same offence III two jurisdictions. In the instant

matter the Respondent -Petitioner Respondent, moved the

Primary Court to Issue summons on Petitioner - Respondent for

tendering a false affidavit, III an application made under

Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act, and thereby

committing an act amounts to a Contempt of Court. The

Learned Magistrate has refused to Issue notice on the

Respondent Appellant on the basis that there IS a action

pending III the High Court of Badulla, regarding the same

charge of Contempt of Court III the case bearing

No. 128/2003.

The above principle echoes III the case of Sellaiya

Sribalan . vs. the Attorney General decided on 29.03.2012,

which has stated thus;

"I hold the VIew that the Attorney General has the

power to send an indictment to the High Court III respect

of summery offence (an offence triable by the Magistrate)

and when such an indictment IS forwarded, the High

Court Judge has the power to hear, try and determine

the case and that the Magistrate loses jurisdiction to

hear such a case." (emphasis added)

It is apparent that the identical matter is now been adjudicated

III the High Court of Badulla, which is a higher forum,

9

than the Primary Court. Hence the above does not merit

any action to be taken In the Primary Court, for Contempt

of Court.

F or the above compelling reasons, this court will set aside the

impugned order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

19.05.2007, and allow the Appeal accordingly.

Appeal is allowed.

We order no costs.
