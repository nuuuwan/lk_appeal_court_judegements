It is not as if a video tape is replayed on the mental screen .... (5) In regard to exact time of an incident, or the time duration of an occurrence, usually, people make their estimates by guess work on the spur of the moment at the time of interrogation. And one cannot expect people to make very precise or reliable estimates in such matters. Again, it depends on the time- sense of individuals which varies from person to person.... (7) A witness, though wholly truthful, is liable to be overawed by the court atmosphere and the piercing cross examination made by counsel and out of nervousness mix up facts, get confused regarding sequence of events, or fill up details from imagination on the spur of the moment. The sub-conscious mind of the witness sometimes so operates on account of the fear of looking foolish or being disbelieved though the witness is giving a truthful and honest account of the occurrence witnessed by him-Perhaps it is a sort of a psychological defense mechanism activated on the spur of the moment.\"",

Though the learned counsel stated so, it is apparent that the appellant had merely stated his version and how he was treated by the police during the time he was in the custody of police. In this particular case the version of the appellant is not sufficient enough to create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case. Therefore, the learned High Court Judge cannot be found fault with. I do not think that merely considering the dock statement alone would warrant an acquittal when considering the strong evidence of the prosecution placed against the appellant. Therefore, facts of the above mentioned case by the counsel for the appellant differ from the present case. Even though the appellant was said to have been treated in inhuman way, the Trial Judge had to consider the evidence placed before her.",
