Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Accused Appellant was indicted before the High Court of Colombo for possession and

Trafficking of 168.4 grams of Heroin, offences punishable under section 54A(d) and 54A(b) of

the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No 13 of 1984.

Mter trial the accused was found guilty of both counts against him and sentenced for life by the

High Court on 14.12.2009. Being dissatisfied with the above conviction and sentence the

accused had preferred this appeal to the Court of Appeal.

During the Argument before this court counsel for the Accused -Appellant raised four grounds of

Appeal.

1) Learned Trial Judge seriously misdirected himself with regard to the defence taken up by the Accused Appellant and there by denied a fair trial

2) Learned Trial Judge failed to ensure a fair trial by not facilitating the assigned counsel for the preparation of his case

3) Learned Trial Judge erred in Law by perusing the notes of the investigating officer and also considering the same as substantive evidence in the case

4) Learned Trial Judge failed to consider the defence version which is more probable than the prosecution version

The prosecution version of this case can be summarized as follows;

Officers attached to Colombo Crimes Division led by P.S Galappaththi was engaged in

petrol duty on the day in question i.e. on 25.10.2004 and on a tip off received from an private

informant, arranged a road block near Wellawatte Railway Station on the sea avenue. At 12.13

pm they stopped a Three-wheeler at the road block, bearing Reg. No.203-3739 and searched the

vehicle. There were two passengers in the rear seat and out of them, 35 packets containing

suspected brown powder were recovered from a bag carried by one Mohamad Haniffa. Out of 35

packets recovered, 34 packets were in the range of 4 - 4.5 cm and one packet was around 7 cm.

The bag carried by Haniffa contained some cloths and the said packets were recovered from the

bottom of the bag.

The suspect and productions were produced at the station around 14.05 pm and there after

recorded a statement from him at 15.10 pm.

With regard to the 151 ground of appeal, counsel brought to the notice of this court the following

observations by the Learned Trial Judge. At page 14 of his Judgment, the Learned Trial Judge

has observed that the Accused had taken a defence of alibi and since the Accused had failed to

follow the provisions of section 126 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, the said defence

should be rejected. However the Learned Trial Judge has thereafter proceeded to considered the

defence to ascertain whether the said defence creates a doubt on the prosecution case.

The Accused had decided to make a dock statement when he was explained of his rights by the

High Court at the conclusion of the prosecution case. In his dock statement the accused had said

that, on the day in question he had gone to Lakmal Hotel in Bambalapitiya to meet a Pakistani

National who is known to him for some time. This person used to bring cloths from Pakistan.

When he was talking to the Pakistani National in his room, Pakistani National went out to

answer a telephone call. Few minutes later 4 Police Officers entered the room, waited for few

minutes, when he informed the Police Officers that the Pakistani National who occupied the

room had gone out, but since he didn't return, the accused was brought to the Police Station with

two bags they recovered from the room. He denied the fact that he was arrested at Wellawatte as

described by the prosecution.

The Learned Trial Judge concluded that this is a defence of Alibi since the suspect denies the

fact that he was arrested at Wellawatte around 1.00 pm, but the accused admits the fact that he

was arrested by Police around the same time at a different place.

In a defence of alibi, the position takes up by the Accused is that, since he was elsewhere at that

time, he couldn't have committed the offence as explained by the prosecution.

In the present case the position taken up by the Accused is quite different. He denies the fact that

he was arrested at Wellawatte around 1.00 pm but states that he was arrested around the same

time by the same officers at Bambalapitiya inside a hotel. We cannot agree with the contention

of the Learned High Court Judge, that the Accused had taken up a defence of Alibi.

On the other hand Learned High Court Judge was of the view that proper notice of alibi had not

been given by the defence. Even if this court concludes that, the defence taken up by the accused

is an alibi, I observe that the accused had taken up this defence throughout the case and in fact

made several suggestions to witness to the effect that the arrest took place in Bambalapitiya and

not in Wellawatte. However we find that no prejudice has caused to the Accused by the position

taken up by the Learned Trial Judge since he has proceeded to consider the merits of the defence

and come to a conclusion based on its merits.

Learned defence counsel brings to the notice of this Court the proceeding of 12th May 2009

recorded at page 159 of the brief. It is recorded on that day "Accused Present, it is informed that

Attorney-at-Law Lakshman Perera is appearing for him but there is no appearance for the

accused. Attorney-at-Law Amila Udayangani is assigned for the Accused, will be taken up

later. "

At page 160 it is recorded that on the same day i.e. on 12.05.2009, the accused is present

Attorney-at-Law Amila Udayangani appear for him and Government Analyst Kokawala

Pathiranage Chandrani's, Evidence had been recorded on that day. Cross examination of the

defence commenced at page 182 and concluded at page 184. It appears that the entire evidence

of the Government Analyst was concluded on that day. Counsel for the appellant further brings

to the notice of court, that the counsel who appeared for the Accused prior to 12.05.2009 had

continued to appear for the accused on the next day i.e. on 05.06.2009. He further submits that,

there is no indication on the proceeding of 12.05.2009 that the copies of necessary documents

including Copy of the Indictment, Government Analyst Report etc. had been handed over to the

assigned counsel on that day.

Article 13 (3) of the constitution reads as follows;

"Any person charged with an offence shall be entitled to be heard, in person or by an

Attorney -at- Law at a fair trial by a competent court."

Section 4 (1) (b) of the ICCPR Act No 56 of 2007 reads as follows;

4 (1) A person charged of a Criminal Offence under any written Law, shall be entitled-

b). to defend himself in person or though legal assistance of his own choosing and

where he does not have any such assistance, to be informed of that right-

From the material placed before this court, we observed that the counsel retained by the accused,

or in other words the counsel of his own choosing had appeared the day prior to 12.05.2009 and

also continued to appear after 12.05.2009. However on 12.05.2009 the court had assigned a

counsel to appear for him and thereafter proceed on the same day to lead the evidence of the

Government Analyst and concluded the evidence by completing the cross examination on the

same day. As pointed out by the Learned Counsel for the Accused- Appellant the court record

does not indicate whether the copy of the Indictment and the copy of the Government Analyst's

Report were handed over to the counsel on that day.

Article 13 (3) guarantees the right of an accused person to be heard in person or by an Attorney-

at -Law at a fair trial. Section 4 (1) (d) of the ICCPR Act assures every person charged of a

criminal offence to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing."

Even though the Trial Judge had decided to assign a counsel to appear for the Accused -

Appellant on 12.05.2009, the counsel so assigned should have a reasonable opportunity to defend

his case. As evident from the case record we cannot satisfy that the Trial Judge had afforded an

opportunity to the counsel assigned by court to prepare for the case for the Accused. At the same

time we are mindful of the provisions in ICCPR Act and of the view that by assigning a counsel

to appear only for the 12th May 2009, the Accused -Appellant was denied legal assistance of his

own choosing.

Learned counsel for the Accused-Appellant further brings to the notice of this court the

following passage from the Judgment of the Learned Trial Judge.

Whilst bringing the notice of this court the above paragraph of the Judgment, Counsel for the

Accused -Appellant submitted that the conduct of the Learned Trial Judge was violation of

section 110 (4) of the Criminal Procedure Cade since he had considered the notes made by

Police Officers as substantive evidence in this case.

The court observes that the Learned Trial Judge had gone through the investigation notes of

witness Priyantha for him to clarify whether there was contradiction between the evidence of

Police Constable Priyantha and P.S Galappaththi. After going through the investigation Notes he

has arrived at a conclusion that there is no contradiction between the evidence of Priyantha and

Galappaththi. Section 110 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedures Act 15 of 1979 only

permits a criminal court to use statements or information not as evidence in the case,

but to aid it in such inquiry or trial.

The question of, the extent to which a statement or information can be used has been discussed

by the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal on numerous occasions and it was repeatedly

confirmed that it cannot be used as evidence or in other words to corroborate the evidence.

On this issued I am mindful of the decision by this court and Supreme Court including Keerthi

Bandara V. Attorney General 2002 (4) Sri LR 245, Sheela Sinharage V, Attorney

General 1985 (1) Sri LR 1, Bandara and other V. Attorney General 1999 Sri LR (3)

168and several other decisions.

In the present case, we observe that the Learned Trial Judge after observing a discrepancy with

regard to the time referred to by the police witnesses Priyantha and Galappaththi, had decided to

go through the notes made by the said two officers. He has not used the notes of Priyantha as

evidence in the case but used it to clarify certain factual position.

7

In support of his 4th Ground of Appeal, counsel for the Accused-Appellant submitted that the

Learned Trial Judge had failed to evaluate his defence with the prosecution version to assess

what version was more probable. According to the dock statement of the Accused as well as the

position taken up him during cross examination of prosecution witnesses, was that, he was

arrested at Bambalapitiya when he went to meet a Pakistani national. Appellant further submitted

the fact that recovery of 12 similar packets at Hotel Lakmali on the same day confirms the above

position.

However the position taken up by the Learned Deputy Solicitor General was that, a second

detection was carried out on the same day at 16.00 pm at Hotel Lakmali by a police team led by

SI Kalupahana, where Police Constable Galappaththi was only a member and twelve similar

packets were recovered at that time was unchallenged. He brought to the notice of this court, that

when SI Kalupahana was summoned by the prosecution to lead evidence with regard to sealing

of productions etc, no questions were put to him with regard to the detection at Lakmali Hotel on

that day and the fact that a second detection was carried out by police at Lakmali Hotel was

unchallenged and therefore the contention of the Appellant that the version of the Appellant was

more probable was not correct. In fact the Learned Trial Judge had considered this aspect at page

11 of his Judgment.

When considering all there issue I find that there is no merit in the 3rd and 4th grounds raised by

the Learned Counsel for the Accused-Appellant. However with regard to the 1 st ground of

Appeal. I am of the view that the Learned High Court Judge had misdirected himself with regard

to the defence taken up by the Accused-Appellant, but, I concluded that no prejudice had been

caused to the Accused- Appellant from the above misdirection for the reason that the Learned

High Court Judge after concluding that the Accused-Appellant had taken up a defence of alibi

had proceeded to evaluate the dock statement and subsequently come to a conclusion on different

reasons.

However as point out by me earlier, Learned Trial Judge has failed to afford an opportunity for

the assign counsel to get ready for the case on 12.05.2009 the day on which the Government

Analyst had given evidence. It is further concluded that by assigning a counsel to appear for the

Accused only for one day, the court had denied legal assistance of his own choosing which is a

violation under section 4 (1) (b) of the ICCPR Act.

For the reasons set out above I conclude that the Learned Trial Judge had failed to ensure a fair

trial to the Accused -Appellant and there for decides to order a fresh trial.

Appeal allowed Re- Trial ordered.
