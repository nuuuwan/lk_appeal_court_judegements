However as discussed above one of the main objective of this section is to protect the rights of a bona fide purchaser, but by operation of this section, can this court simply say that the deed by which petitioner is claiming his right was attested within 12 months of section 2 notice is published and therefore it is null and void, and therefore he is not entitled for compensation, when it is clear to us that the petitioner is a bone fide purchaser, In such a situation, it is the duly of the court to give effect to the main object and intention of the legislation rather than adhearing to the section itself.
