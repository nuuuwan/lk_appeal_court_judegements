Heard Counsel in support of this application and also the learned

Deputy Solicitor General in this application. The petitioner has come

before this Court seeking a writ of certiorari to quash a grant issued

by Her Excellency the President in the year 1998. Petitioner has

named Her Excellency the former President as the 6 th respondent.

According to the facts of this case the original permit holder to this

application was one Banda had died along ago. The said Banda was

the permit holder since 1950's. The said permit holder had

nominated his daughter Anohamy as the successor for the said land

with life interest to his wife Selohamy. As the life interest holder, she

was occupying the said land until her death in year 1991. After her

death Anohamy was not permitted to come to the occupation of the

said land due to her marriage which was not approved by the other

members of the family. However, she had applied for a grant and in

the year 1998, Her Excellency the then President had issued a grant

to her. When the petitioner to the present application had filed action

in the Provincial High Court in the year 2005, by way of an affidavit

the said Anohamy had averred that since her family members are not

t

ilfff

permitting her to come into occupation of the said land, after

obtaining a grant she had filed action in the relevant District Court to

eject them. The petitioner of the present application has now come

before this Court asking a writ of certiorari to quash the same grant

issued to Anohamy. We see no reason to interfere with this grant at

this stage for several reasons. Firstly, the petitioner has come before

this Court almost after 18 years of the said grant making the then

President a respondent. Secondly, the rightful person who was issued

with a valid grant has now gone before the District Court to get

possession of the land since the other members of the family are not

permitting her to come into occupation of the land. Under these

circumstances, we see no reason for us to issue notices in this matter.

Notices refused.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

H.C.J. MADAWALA, J.

I agree.
