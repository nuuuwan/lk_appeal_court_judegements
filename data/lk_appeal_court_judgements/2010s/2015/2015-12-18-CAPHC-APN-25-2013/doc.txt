The Respondent- Petitioner (in short the Petitioner) by his petition

T 1 .... I( , 1 _. 1 Learntu lVHtgi::;lralt UalcU

The shortly stated facts in the above petition are as follows;

That the Petitioner- Respondent (in short the Respondent) ,the Urban

Development Authority, instituted action against the Petitioner, in

In terms of Section 28 A(3) of Urban Development Authority Act

No. 41 of 1978 as amended by Act Nos. 4 and 44 of 1982, and

sought an order to demolish the subject premises.

The Learned Magistrate after considering the facts placed before

Decree authorising the demolition of the said premIses.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Petitioner came by way

of a Revision to this Court to have the said order of the

High Court Judge be set aside or vacate.

It IS salient to note, that the argument was taken, In the

absence of the Respondent, as such this Court had the

opportunity to hear only the argument of the Petitioner.

The facts emerged from the

based on the ground that

Learned High Court Judge

instant petition IS fundamentally

the Learned Magistrate and the

has made said impugned orders

without considering the legal concepts in the correct perspective

as stated below;

That the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge

had failed to consider the building permit marked as X2 and

the document marked X4, which IS the decision of the

Devinuwara Pradeshiya Sabha , further the Certificate of

Conformity marked as X5, issued by the Urban Develop

Authority dated 25 th December 2010.

It IS also contended by the Petitioner that the Urban

Development Authority has imposed taxes on the alleged building,

although it IS alleged by the Respondent that the said premIses

In suit IS an unauthorised structure.

Besides it IS the position of the Petitioner that the Respondent

has no locus standi to institute action in the Magistrate Court

as the premises in suit does not come within the development

area and more fully it IS stated that the Respondent has violated

the Section 13(4) of the Urban Development Authority Act as

the Legal Officer has instituted the action against the Petitioner

4

In the Magistrate Court without proper authorisation by the

Director of the Urban Development Authority.

The Petitioner has adverted Court with many decided cases to

buttress his position as to why this Court should exerCise

Revisionary Jurisdiction to grant reliefs as prayed for in the

petition.

It is a salutary principle that the Revisionary Jurisdiction is an

extraordinary power that the Appellate Court will exercise only

in a situation where a irreparable damage or grave miscarriage of

justice has occurred. The above principle was observed in the

case of MARIAM BEEBEE .VS. SYED MOHAMMED- 68 NLR- 36.

In the instant Revision application the Petitioner has adverted

court to the documents marked X2 which is the Building Permit,

X4 decision of the Pradesiya Sabha of Devinuwara and Certificate

of Conformity marked as X5. The above documents substantiate

the legality of the procedure that was followed by the Petitioner

In constructing the alleged premises. Therefore any order to

demolish such building will be illegal and pervese.

The Counsel for the Petitioner has referred to plathora of

decided cases that was given weight in the legal parlance.

In the case of ATTORNEY GENERAL . VS. PODISINGHO-

(51.NLR-385) stated thus;

"in exercising its powers of reViSIon, this Court is not trammelled

by technical rules of pleadings and other procedure".

"

In the case of POTMAN .VS. IP DODANGODA [71 .NLR. 115] it

was held "that the powers of revision are so wide that revision

IS available even after the appeal has been disposed of .... "

In the case of BISO MANlKA .VS.CYRIL DE ALWIS[ 1982 SLR-

368] it was observed by Sharvananda J. That" when the Court

has examined the record and satisfied, that the order complained

of IS manifestly erroneous or without jurisdiction, the Court be

loathe to allow the mischief of the order to continue and reject

the application simply on the ground of delay unless there are

very extraordinary reasons to justify such rejection".

Hence in the afore said legal and factual matrix this Court is

of the view that the said impugned orders of the Learned High

Court Judge and the order of the Learned Magistrate should be

set aside forthwith.

Accordingly Petitioner's application IS allowed. We order no costs.
