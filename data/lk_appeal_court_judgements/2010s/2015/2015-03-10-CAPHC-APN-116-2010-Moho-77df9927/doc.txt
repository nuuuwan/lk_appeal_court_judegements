1

Counsel for the accused-petitioner contends that this is a

matter which should go back to the High Court for further trial as the

High Court Judge by his order dated 11.05.2010 had not permitted the

defence to adduce evidence of the fact that the accused was arrested in

a manner different to the way spoken of by the prosecution. After this

evidence was disallowed, it appears that the learned High Court Judge

had also not permitted another witness who was sought to be called by

the defence thereafter on the same basis.

2

Learned Senior State Counsel who appears for the Attorney

General contends that due process and ends of justice would be best

served if this matter goes back to the High Court for the evidence that

had been excluded, to be led afresh and the trial concluded to a finish,

for the reason that the same evidence had been permitted at the previous

trial in 2004 and that can be considered as a notice given to the

prosecution of the case that the accused was seeking to present at his

trial.

Learned Counsel for the accused-petitioner also submits that

he has no objection to the adoption of the entire prosecution evidence

that had been led up to the point of the conclusion of the prosecution

case. He further submits that the defence evidence at the further trial

would focus mostly on items of evidence that were excluded by the trial

Judge.

In the circumstances, this Court is of the view that the order

made by the learned High Court Judge dated 11.05.2010(P2) should be

set aside and the matter is sent back for further trial. Counsel for the

accused-petitioner makes an application that this case be heard by a
