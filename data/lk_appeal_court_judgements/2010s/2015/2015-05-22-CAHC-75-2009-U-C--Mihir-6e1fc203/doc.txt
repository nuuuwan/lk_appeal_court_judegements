Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C., J (PICA)

Heard both Counsel on the appeal. At the outset Counsel

for the petitioner submits that he will only be canvassing the sentence

before us and not the conviction. In support of the above contention

he submits that the accused was 17 years and the victim was 14 years

when this incident had taken place. The charge in the indictment is

one under Section 365 (B) (2) (b) of the Penal Code, an offence of

grave sexual abuse. However the learned President's Counsel appearing

for the accused-appellant submits the evidence at pages 62 and 63 and

submits that if at all an offence had been committed, the offence

would be one of attempt to commit an act of grave sexual abuse or

one under Section 345 of the Penal Code. However after trial the

learned High Court Judge had convicted him for grave sexual abuse

and imposed a sentence of 17 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine

of Rs.l 00,0001= and in default sentence of one year rigorous imprisonment.

We have carefully considered the evidence of this case of the view

that the above sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge is

excessive. The learned Deputy Solicitor General who appears for the

Attorney- General concedes the above position.

After considering submissions of both parties we decide to

reduce the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge to a

term of 8 years rigorous imprisonment. Rest of the sentence will

remain unchanged. At this stage the Counsel for the appellant moves

Court to make order to back date the sentence. We make order that

the jail term imposed by this Court that is eight years ngorous

imprisonment should start from the date of conviction that is from

13.03.2009. Subject to the above variation of sentence the appeal

stands dismissed.

Registrar is directed to return the record to the High

Court of Matara for the Court to inform the accused of the new

sentence imposed and to issue a new committal accordingly. Appeal

stands dismissed.

I agree.
