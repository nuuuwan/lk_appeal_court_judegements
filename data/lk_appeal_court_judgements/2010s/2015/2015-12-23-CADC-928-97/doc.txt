ARGUED ON: 22.06.2015

DECIDED ON: 15.12.2015

M.M.A. Gaffoor J.,

The Plaintiff Appellant (hereinafter referred to as "the Plaintiff')

instituted this action in the District Court of Embilipitiya against the

DefendantlRespondent (hereinafter referred to as "the Defendant")

seeking inter alia for the following reliefs stating that:

i) The Plaintiff Appellant was the owner of the lands called

"Koratuwa Kumbura" and "Gala Kumbura" and his

brother, Sumanasena was the owner of the lands called

"Karawgahamula Kumbura" and "Ninda kumbua: The

above lands were cultivated by the plaintiff appellant.

ii) While the Plaintiff Appellant was possessing the above

lands the Defendant Respondent and several persons in the

village have unreasonably disturbed the Plaintiff-

Appellant's possession;

iii) The Plaintiff says that the Defendant was the Divisional

Officer of the "Panamura" Agrarian Services Office, who

on or about 4.3.1990 prohibited him from cultivating these

lands unreasonably and illegally;

iv) Subsequently the Defendant Respondent has divided and

allocated the above lands to several village people on or

around 6.5.1990 illegally and this action is completely ultra

vires;

v) Subsequently the Defendant has tried to change the name

of the Plaintiff in respect of his lands in the Agricultural

Lands Registers in order to dispossess by him;

3

vi) Being aggrieved by the said facts, the Plaintiff lodged an

action before the Primary Court of Embilipitya bearing No.

15906;

vii) The Plaintiff became entitled to possess his lands after the

order of the Primary Court of Embilipitiya;

viii) The Plaintiff sent a letter of demand to the Defendant

Respondent for damages caused by the Defendant which he

assessed at Rs. 50.000/-;

ix) The Defendant has not paid the sum of Rs. 50,000/- claimed

in the aforesaid letter of demand to him; and

x) Therefore the Plaintiff filed this action to recover the sum

of Rs. 50,000/- as damages and costs;

The Dehendant by his answer dated 12.12.1992 denied the

allegations of the Appellant and stated that he has acted within

the purview of the powers vested with him as Divisional Officer

and the issue is an administrative act.

He further raised a preliminary objection that the Plaintiff,

when he filed a case against a State Officer, he must make the

Hon. Attorney General a party to this case which he failed. He

further made a claim in reconvention in a sum of Rs. 50.000/- as

damages.

4

The Plaintiff filed his Replication to Defendant's answer

and the cross claim. and prayed for the rejection of the answer

and the cross claim.

The trial of this case commenced with 2 Admissions and 15

Issues. The Issues 1 - 7 were raised on behalf of the Plaintiff and

Issues 8 to 15 were raised by the Defendant.

At the trial the Plaintiff Appellant and five witnesses gave

evidence on his behalf and closed the case. In his evidence the

Plaintiff stated that he was in occupation of the lands, which

were owned by him and his brother and that the Defendant has

unlawfully decided to prohibit the Appellant from cultivation of

the lands. The Plaintiff further pleaded that the Defendant has

altered the entries in the Register to deny the Appellant his lawful

cultivation of the lands.

At the conclusion of the trial the learned trial Judge by his

judgment dated 20.08.1997 dismissed the Plaintiff's action and the

claim in reconvention of the Defendant.

The plaintiff has preferred this appeal from the judgment.

The Plaintiff has described the grounds of appeal as

follows:

a) That the learned District Judge has not considered

the facts of the case and came to an erroneous

conclusion and erred in law:

b) That the learned District Judge came to an erroneous

conclusion and erred law by concluding that the

5

plaintiff's evidence is inadmissible due to

unsoundness of mind of the Plaintiff;

c) That the learned District Judge came to a erroneous

conclusion and erred in law that the cause of action is

a dispute relating to a paddy field;

d) And therefore to vacate the judgment entered on

20.08.1997 nd to enter judgment in his favour

It was argued by Counsel that the action of the Plaintiff in

the original court the alleged unlawful and ultra vires decision to

prohibit the Appellant from cultivating the paddy lands referred

to in the plaint but there was no specific reference to metes and

bounds of such lands.

Although the Plaintiff urged that the lands refered to in the

Plaint is either owned by him alone or together with his brother

but he has failed to prove the ownership, He did not produce a

single document or oral evidence. During the examination in

chief the Plaintiff once stated that the land belonged to the Land

Reform Commission. Rev. Kudagoda Hemarathna Thero giving

evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff stated that the Koratuwe

Kumbura was owned by the temple of Wallgoda and the Plaintiff

and another were the tenant cultivators. The witness further

stated that subsequent to a dispute as to the ownership and the

tenancy rights. The Divisional Officer held an inquiry to which

the witness attended. As a result of the finding at the inquiry the

cultivation of the land was stopped. Prior to the dispute, this land

was cultivated by Sumanarathna and his occupation was

disturbed by the Plaintiff and that was the beginning of the

present action.

The trial Judge has misdirected himself in conducting the

trial. On a perusal of the prayer of the Plaintiff the Plaintiff has

prayed for the recovery of Rs. 500,000/- being damages and costs

of action. He has not asked for any other relief though the case is

registered as a land case, It is in fact a money claim. The Plaintiff

has narrated the incidents of the interruption of his cultivation by

the Defendant and finally in paragraph 10 of the plaint he says

"due to the unlawful and illegal actions of the Defendant he

sustained damages in a sum of Rs. 50,0001- and that he sent a

letter of demand."

Therefore he says in para. 11 of the Plaint that a cause of

action had accrued to him to recover Rs. 50,000/- from the

Defendant. Hence. for all purposes it is a money claim and not a

land case. In this respect it is to be noted that the character of the

action should not be changed. The true definition of "cause of

action" is the action on the part of the Defendant which gives the

Plaintiff his cause of complain. The Plaintiffs cause of complain is

the damages caused to him by the alleged unlawful action of the

Defendant and nothing to do with the rights of ownership or

possession of the land mentioned in the Plaint.. Further the

Plaintiff has not given a schedule of the land in the plaint if this

case is to be treated as a land case. I am therefore of the view that

this case is not a case in respect of the rights to the land but a

money claim only, and as such the court need not go into the

evidence in respect of the land mentioned in the Plaint.

7

It is also to be noted that there is no dispute between he

Plaintiff and the Defendants to the right to the said land. The

Defendant has not claimed any rights to the land. Therefore, this

case cannot be treated as a land case. As stated above, the

character of the action cannot be changed. A money claim, in the

present case, has been changed to a land case, and the trial court

has allowed the evidence to go on that respect. The trial Judge

should have limited the evidence only in respect of the claim of Rs.

50,000/- claimed by the Plaintiff.

As regards the contention that the Attorney General is not

made a Defendant in this case, which is filed against the

Defendant, who is a State Officer. This contention cannot be

sustained as the case has been filed against the Defendant not as a

State Officer but as a private person (see paras. 2 and 3 of the

Replication by the Plaintifl). Furthermore, in the Primary Court

case No. 15906, the parties to the dispute was the Plaintiff and the

Defendant. The Plaintiff's position is that the Defendant

maliciously took action against him to stop the cultivation. If the

Plaintiff says that the Defendant has personally acted against him,

the liability is personal and therefore the Attorney General cannot

be made a Defendant and to take the defence of the action under

Section 463 of the Civil Procedure Code. But if the Defendant has

acted in his official capacity only a notice of action under Sec 461

of the Civil Procedure Code should be given. In this case, the

evidence of the Plaintiff and his witness Jayawardena's evidence

8

clearly how that the Defendant's actions were on personal

revenge. I therefore reject the contention that the Attorney

General should be made a party Defendant in this case. The only

questions that remains to be answered are "whether the Plaintiff

has proved his claim of Rs. 50,000/- s damages and the Defendant

has proved his claim in reconvention.

The evidence of the Plaintiff has not satisfactorily

established any damaged caused to him to claim Rs 50,000/- as

compensation thereto, except for certain expenses incurred in

respect of the Primary Court case, he has not incurred any

substantial amount, other than the Primary Court case expenses.

The plaintiff has thus failed to establish by way of evidence, the

damages claimed by him . On the other hand the Defendant has

claimed Rs. 50,000/- as a cross claim in his Answer, But in his

evidence he said that the Plaintiff defamed me by burning an

effigy of any figure and caused me pain in mind and therefore I

assessed my compensation at Rs. 50,000/-. But this evidence is not

proved by any other independent evidence.

Regarding the damages claimed by the Plaintiff and the

defendant, the decision of the trial Judge is very reasonable. The

learned Judge has held that the Plaintiff has failed to prove that

the Defendant maliciously caused damages to him and the

Defendant has also not produced sufficient evidence to establish

his cross claim and he has dismissed Plaintiff's action with costs

9

and rejected the cross of the Defendant. I do not want to interfere

with the findings of the learned trial Judge,

This appeal is without any merit and is liable to be

dismissed. Both parties to bear their own costs,

Wijesundera J.,

I agree.
