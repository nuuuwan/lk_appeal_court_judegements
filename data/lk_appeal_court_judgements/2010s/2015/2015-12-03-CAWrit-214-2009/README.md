The first and second petitioners have filed this application seeking

a writ of Mandamus against the first respondent to vest the house and

appurtenant land depicted as lot 3 in plan 2301 (P6) and for a writ of

Certiorari to quash the award of the Board of Valuation marked as P12A

and P12B.

The first respondent is the Commissioner of National Housing and

second to fourth respondents are all members of the Board of Valuation

established in terms of Ceiling on Housing Property Law No.1 of 1973.

The fifth respondent is the statutory tenant and the sixth respondent is

the Subject Minister.

The petitioners stated that at all times material to the instant

application they were the owners of the property described in Deed No.

3571 which included the house bearing No. 26 Station Road, Mt. Lavinia

and land in extent of one rood and 1.61 perches. The petitioners have

made an application to the first respondent to construct a building in the

excess land which was refused under Sec. 20 of the Rent Act. Another

application was made to the Rent Board which was allowed on

3

03/04/1984. The petitioners were allowed to build a house in the excess

land in lot 1 in plan 2897C. The fifth respondent being aggrieved by the

order has made an application for a writ of Certiorari in the Court of

Appeal which had been dismissed. The fifth respondent's appeal to the

Rent Board of Review was also refused. (X3 and X4).

The petitioners stated that when they bought the house the fifth

respondent gave an undertaking to vacate the house but went back on

the undertaking and made an application to the first respondent to

purchase the house under the Ceiling on Housing Property Law. The

first respondent has allowed the fifth respondent's application and a

recommendation was sent to the sixth respondent. The petitioners

stated that in September 1985 the said house owned by them was

vested in the first respondent under Sec. 17 (1) of the Ceiling on

Housing Property Law, by order published in the Government Gazette

notification P3. The petitioners stated that the said house was the only

residential house owned by them at that time. The petitioners have

made an application to the Court of Appeal which was dismissed by the

Court of Appeal (P4A and P4B). The petitioners have made an

application for leave to appeal in the Supreme Court which was allowed

by the Supreme Court (P4C). The Supreme Court on 17/09/2002 had

directed the first respondent to make a determination in respect of the

extent of land that is reasonably appurtenant to the house, and was

4

directed to take steps in terms of Sec. 16 (1). The petitioners stated that

the first respondent in the Supreme Court agreed for the petitioners to

retain the excess land and the land was surveyed and plan No. 2361

marked P6 was made. In P6 the excess land is shown as lot 1, lot 2 is

the access road and lot 3 is the house. The petitioners have received a

letter marked as P7 A by which they were informed that only lot 3 will be

vested for the fifth respondent when the Gazette notification was filed

under Sec. 20 of the Ceiling on Housing Property Law. The petitioners

have made a claim for compensation in respect of lot 3 (P8) to the first

respondent. The petitioners stated that they did not make any claims in

respect of lots 1 and 2 since they were not vested with the first

respondent. The petitioners' application had been referred to a board of

valuation comprising second, third and fourth respondents the

proceedings are marked as P9 and P10. The computation of

compensation had been in dispute since the fifth respondent had said it

should be calculated on the value at the time of the original vesting date

which was in year 1985 and the petitioners claiming from the value in

the years in which the Supreme Court order was made. The petitioners

have been informed that they have been awarded a sum of Rs.

2,71,0001= as compensation and stated that the ownership of the land

has not been proved. The value in 1985 was taken in computing the

compensation. These are marked as P12A and P12B.

The counsel for the petitioners submitted that according to the

Supreme Court order what was vested is the house and not the entire

land. The petitioners stated that the fourth to sixth respondents erred in

law when computing compensation due on a valuation in 1985. When

there was an order by the Supreme Court much later. The petitioners

stated that the decision of the valuation Board is final and the first

respondent had no authority to alter the same.

The learned Senior State Counsel for the respondents stated that

under Sec. 16 (1) the house and the appurtenant land go with the house

and that the land is not valued separately. Citing the judgment in

Lee/awathi vs Pinto 3 Colombo Appellate Law Reports 100 said that

the land is not separately valued. The respondents further submitted

that there is no statutory duty done by the first respondent to issue a writ

of Mandamus against the first respondent. The respondents stated that

the valid vesting order is the Gazette notification published in 1985 on

which date the value should be calculated.

Gazette notification 367 of 13/09/1985 marked as P3, the said

house has been vested in the commissioner for National Housing with

effect from the said date. The petitioners have made an application to

the Supreme Court after this date and in the Supreme Court the first

6

respondent had agreed to give the excess land to the petitioners. This

judgment is dated 27/01/2003. Thereafter plan No. 2301 marked as P6

was made and the house is shown in lot 3 and the lots 2 as the access

road and 1 as the excess land which the first respondent has agreed the

petitioners could retain. This is shown in the letter marked as P7 A dated

26/12/2002 in which the first respondent has informed the petitioners

that they have decided not to acquire lot 1 and only the house which will

include the land appurtenant amounting to 21.26 perches will be

acquired. After that on 30105/2003 Gazette Notification No. 1291 has

been published under Sec. 20 stating the house no. 26, Station Road,

Mt. Lavinia is vested with the first respondent from the date of the said

notice. In this document the extent of the land so vested is 21.26

perches.

Sec/16 (1) of the Act states;

Where any house which is not a flat or a tenement is vested in the

Commissioner under this Law. There shall also be vested in the

Commissioner such extent of land as is in the opinion of the

Commissioner reasonably appurtenant to the house.

Therefore the land vested by the Gazette notification marked P73

is the land mentioned in the said notice and not the land shown as lot 1

7

of P6. Only 21 .26 perches along with the house have been vested with

the first respondent.

Sec. 15 (1) of the Act says.

Be/ore the date specified by the Commissioner or by the Minister

under this Law, as the date on which any house vests in the

Commissioner, the Commissioner or the Minister, as the ease may

be, may from time to time, alter, by Notification or Order, as the

ease may be, published in the Gazetter, the date on which such

house shall so vest

Therefore by the consequent Gazette notification the earlier

Gazette notification becomes invalid. P7B was published after the

settlement entered in the Supreme Court and it should stand since it

was published after an order by the Supreme Court.

The valuation of the property so vested should be calculated on

the market value on the date in which it was vested which should be the

date of P7B, and not P3.

For the afore stated reasons the application of the petitioner is

allowed. Prayer C and F of the petitioners petition is allowed and writs of

Mandamus and Certiorari are issued.
