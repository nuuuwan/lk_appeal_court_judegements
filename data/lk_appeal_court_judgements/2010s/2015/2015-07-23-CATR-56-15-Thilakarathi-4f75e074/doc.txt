In this matter the petitioner has come before this Court

seeking an order for the transfer of the case pending in the District

Court of Trincomalee Case No. D/ 1611/2014 under Section 46 of

the Judicature Act. This Court after issuing notices on the

respondent also issued a stay order restraining the Learned

District Judge proceeding the matter in the said District Court.

Though notices were issued on the respondent on several

occasions, respondent was absent and unrepresented. On 4th June

2015 this matter was come up before this Court and matter was

fIxed for inquiry today.

Copy of the stay order has been dispatched even

thereafter on 05.06.2015 to the District Judge, District Court of

Trincomalee. We are of the view that the respondent has

sufficient notices of this matter and if the respondent was

interested in objecting for the transfer, there was ample time for

the respondent to come before Court and object to this

application.

The petitioner to this case is a lady from J affna who

got married to the respondent who is a resident of Trincomalee.

After the marriage was broken, she has gone back to her home

town and she is presently with her parent. The respondent has

filed this divorce action in the District Court of Trincomalee. She

complained of her hardship coming to Trincomalee to appear for

this case and she has also complained that she has two children

and she has no way of leaving them in J affna in order to come to

attend District Court proceeding in the District Court of

Trincomalee. She further submits that when she is coming to the

District Court of Trincomalee, she doesn't have a proper place to

stay with her children. Petitioner further submits that the

maintenance application filed by the petitioner against the

respondent is pending in the Magistrate's Court of Jaffna too.

Under these circumstances, she has prayed from this Court to

make order transferring this case bearing No. D/1611/2014

pending in the District Court of Trincomalee to the District Court

of Jaffna acting under Section46 of the Judicature Act read with

Section 10 of the Civil Procedure Code.

We are satisfied that this is a fit and proper case for

this Court to make order as prayed for by the petitioner in

prayer (ii) of the petition transferring case bearing No.

D/ 1611/2014 to the District Court of Jaffna.

Registrar is directed to communicate this order to the

Registrar, District Court of Trincomalee and also to the Registrar,

District Court of Jaffna to take necessary steps. The Registrar is

further directed to issue a certified copy of this order to the

petitioner on payment of usual charges.
