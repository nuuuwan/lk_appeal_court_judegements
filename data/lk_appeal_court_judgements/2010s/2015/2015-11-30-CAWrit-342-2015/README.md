The petitioner has filed this application to seek mandate in the nature of writ certiorari quashing

the license No. 26467 issued to the 5th respondent in respect of the land called Nagahapanawe

3

watte at Uda Karavita. She has also sought an interim order as prayed for in para (d) of the prayer

of the petition namely,

(d) "to make an interim Order, suspending the Licence No. 26467 issued to the 5th

Respondent and lor restraining the 5th Respondent, his agents, servants from

carrying out mining, extracting gravel and washing such gravel in the land

'Nagahapanawe Watte' at Uda Karavita, until the final determination of this

application; "

Having considered the submissions of both parties we find that the title of the petitioner is in

dispute. The petitioner has claimed 2/3rd share of the land in dispute and 1I3rd share of mineral

rights of the land called 'Nagapanawa Watte' which she has become entitled to as legal heir of the

deceased Meegasthennalage Saraneris and his wife. The 5th respondent contesting the title of

Saraneris had stated that Saraneris was not entitled to any share of the land in dispute at the time

of his death and hence the petitioner has not inherited any rights or title from her father.

The 5th respondent had claimed lease hold rights by virtue of indenture of lease No 9605 dated 5-

11-2014 from persons known as Dougla Thennakoon Bandara, Wilmot Jayasundara and

Meegasthennelage Saraneris who owned l/3rd share each of the land in dispute. He has made an

application for a license which the petitioner had objected to on the ground that the pedigree set

out by the 5th respondent was false and fictitious. Further the 5th respondent has taken up the

position that the petitioner has filed the present action on 25-08-2015 that is more than four and

half month after the decision of the license was communicated to her and thereby is guilty of

laches. The 5th respondent also submitted that the petitioner claimed to be a person governed by

the Kandyan Law. The petitioner's father was living in Kuruwita in a Sabaragamuwa Province

within the Kandyan Province. The petitioner has not expressly refuted the contention of the 5th

respondent. It was submitted that the diga married daughter will not inherit paternal property even

if she is the only child. She will inherit paternal property only if her marriage is binna marriage. If

she is married under the General Marriage Ordinance, then in terms of section 3(2) of the Marriage

and Divorce(Kandyan Law) No. 41 of 1975 her right to the paternal property is governed by the

Kandyan Law. Marriage contracted between kandyan and under General Law is presumed to be a

diga marriage. The petitioner has to prove that she acquired binna rights. Accordingly we find that

the locus standi of the petitioner is also in dispute.

The petitioner however had stated that she had instituted partition case no 29940 IP in the District

Court of Rathnapura on 20- 2 -2015 in order to vindicate her rights and partition of the land among

the Co-Owners. It was submitted by the petitioner that the 5th respondent publicly claimed that a

license has been issued to him and was making preparation to do mining operations in the land.

The petitioner having complained to the relevant Authorities the said license has been suspended

until the conclusion of the pending inquiry. The respondent however by letter dated 10-8-2015 has

informed that the mine of gravel in mine No.1 would be carried out from the 10th of August 2015.

The 4th respondent has taken step to revoke the letter X 14 and the police has requested the 5th

respondent to desist from any mining duties. However the petitioner has received another letter

dated 19-8-2015 issued by the 4th respondent stating that the suspension imposed on the license

No 26467 by letter dated 5-8-2015 would be revoked with effect from 19-8-2015 consequent for

the approval given by the 2nd respondent after an inquiry conducted by him but proceedings of

such inquiry is not before us. The 5th respondent submitted that the petitioner had not explained

the delay in making this application. As such the petitioner who has absolutely no right to the

land, denial of interim relief will not likely to cause any injustice to the petitioner.

The fact that the petitioner appealed to the 15t respondent against the decision clearly shows that

she was aware ofthe determination made to issue a license. The 5th respondent also has submitted

that he has invested on water pumps, timber, implements such as mammoties necessary for mining

and building of huts for the workers and also have employed 30 people for the Gemming operation.

That if court issued an interim order it will cause much prejudice and hardship to the 5th respondent,

but we observe that the 5th respondent had carried out operation on the license issued even during

the period it was under suspension and therefore we cannot agree with the above submission.

We are ofthe view that as there is a partition case pending that if the 5th respondent is allowed to

clear the land and involved in gemming operation that grave and irremediable damage and injustice

would occur to the petitioner and the Co-Owners of the land in dispute.

According to regulation 8(2) of the Regulations made under the National Gems and Jewellary

Authority Act read as fallows,

"No license shall be granted to any person unless-

a. He himself owns the land, or

5

b. He has obtained the consent of so many of the other owners as to ensure that the

application and such other consenting owners together own at least two thirds of

the land in respect of which the application has been made"

The position taken up by the petitioners on this issue was that the 5th respondent is not a soil owner

and therefore, in law he could not have been issued a license to gem in the land in question. When

considering the arguments placed by both parties before us, the court is of the view that both these

positions placed by the two parties will have a significant bearing on the final outcome ofthis case.

We further observe that a decision has reached around 10-4-2014 (X13) to grant a license but

between April and June series of events have has taken place with or without authority by the 1 st

respondent. What took place during this period is also important since the license had been finally

issued only on 25-6-2015 but what exactly took place during this period is not property placed by

the respondent before this court.

When considering material place by both parties before this court, in order to avoid any injustice

to either party it is necessary is grant an interim order as prayed for in paragraph (d) of the prayer

of the petition.

We allow and grant interim relief as prayed for in paragraph (d) of the prayer to the petition.
