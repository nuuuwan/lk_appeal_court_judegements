The plaintiff appellant has instituted an action in the District Court

of Kegalle against the first to third defendant respondents for a

declaration of title and ejectment of the defendant from the land

described in the schedule to the plaint. The plaintiff appellant stated that

the original owners of the land called "Haduwehena" were Ukkiriya,

Waththuwa and Hapi who were entitled to %, %, and 1/4 shares

respectively. Ukkiriya's % share was conveyed to Rankira and

Laminduwa by Deed no. 19883. This % share of the land was inherited

by Rankira's son the plaintiff. This fact, the learned District Judge by

answering issues no. 1 and 2 in favor of the plaintiff has accepted the

plaintiff appellant's title and claim to % share of the land.

The plaintiff claimed the first and second defendants came into

unlawful occupation of the said land in 1986 causing damage to the

plaintiff appellant's land.

The first and second defendant respondents have claimed

prescriptive title to the land and stated that a survey plan is necessary to

identify the land in issue and to make a final decision on the said land in

issue. The learned District Judge after trial has delivered the judgment 3

on 16/10/1997 answering the first and second issues in favor of the

plaintiff appellant but has dismissed the plaintiff's case. The instant

appeal is against the said judgment.

The learned District Judge has stated that the share claimed by

the plaintiff appellant should go to the plaintiff appellant but at the same

time it has been said by answering issued no. 22 and 23 in favor of the

defendant respondents that for a correct order to be made the land had

to be identified by a survey plan by a court commissioner. The learned

District Judge should have done this at the commencement of the trial

when the parties made no admission regarding the corpus.

The defendants have claimed the rights of Hapi who was one of

the original owners. The learned District Judge in her judgment at one

point states that Siriya was Hapi's daughter and again she states that

Siriya was Wattuwa's daughter. This is a clear misdirection of facts as

well as evidence.

The District Judge has failed to evaluate the evidence placed

before court and has not given reasons as to how the issues were

answered, at some points contradicting each other. The District Judge

4

has granted part of the relief claimed by the plaintiff appellant by

answering issue 1 and 2 in his favor and accepted his title but has

answered the rest in the negative.

The District Judge has referred to the Magistrates Court case filed

under Sec. 66 of Primary Courts Ordinance where it has been stated

there were no clear boundaries on the land and to get the permanent

boundaries demarcated by filing a civil action in the District Court. This

shows that the District Judge failed to take into account that a final

judgment can not be reached until the land is properly identified and

boundaries demarcated.

The plaintiffs title has been admitted by the District Judge but the

defendants have failed to show that they are in occupation legally.

When the plaintiffs title is accepted by court the defendant has to prove

his that he is in lawful occupation of the land. Theivandran Vs

Ramanathan Chettiar 1986 1 SLR 219 , Beebi Johora Vs

Warusavitharana 1998 3 SLR 9 since the title was admittedly in plaintiff

appellant the burden was on the defendant respondents to show by

what right they were is possession of the premises. This has not been

considered by the learned District Judge.

,

After admitting the plaintiff appellant's title to the land the District

Judge has gone on to say by answering issues 22 and 23 in favor of the

defendant respondents that the plaintiff can not proceed with the case

without a proper plan to identify the land in dispute and its boundaries

and dismissed the plaintiff's action. This is a clear misdirection of facts

and law.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to set aside the judgment of

the learned District Judge of Kegalle dated 16/10/1997 and order a trial

de novo.
