12.12.2014, and the order of the Learned High Court Judge dated

12.02.2015.

The facts germane to the present application are as follows;

The Officer In charge of the Galle Police station filed

information In the Magistrate Court Galie, in terms of Section

98(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, in

the case bearing No. 9717l.

The said information filed, as the investigation In to the alleged

nuisance has been caused by the Petitioner by USIng a Metal

Quarry, as a result of which the Public health and Physical

Comfort has been affected. Hence the Complainant urged the

Learned Magistrate to Issue orders In terms of Section 1 04( 1)

and 1 06( 1 ) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Thereafter the Complainant has tendered a ('omprehensive report

regarding the above situation. Pursuant to the afore said report

the Learned Magistrate has made an order, to stop the operation

of the said Metal Quarry. Subsequently, the Learned Magistrate after

an inspection of the relevant Quarry, and receiving evidence of

many witnesses had made the above conditional order "absolute"

in terms of Section 101 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979 and had made over for the Petitioner to remove

the business operation situated in Haupe, within one month from

the date of the said order. Being aggrieved by the said order the

Petitioner filed a Revision application in the High Court, of Galle

which application was dismissed by the order dated 12.02.2015.

The Learned High Court Judge has dismissed the said application

in Revision on the basis that the Petitioner has not established

exceptional circumstances for the High Court Judge to exerCIse

the revisionary jurisdiction to resolve the issue in dispute.

The Petitioner has assailed the said order of the Learned High

Court Judge by the instant Revision Application to this Court. It

is the contention of the Petitioner that the Learned Magistrate's

order making the conditional order absolute, when at a time there

was no conditional order in force, hence the order absolute is

obnoxious to the above section 102 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act.

The Respondent, also concedes the fact that the Learned High

Court Judge has not afforded an opportunity to the Petitioner to

placed his case, but has dismissed the application In limine,

which is violation of the Principles of Natural Justice.

The Counsel for the Respondent also admits the fact that the

Learned Magistrate has made his order on mere speculations, and

further more it is stated by the Counsel for the Respondent that

the Learned Magistrate has made a blatant error regarding the

exhibits marked Vl6 AND V17, and agreed to the vacation of

the order of the Learned Magistrate and for a institution of a

fresh action based on V 16,

The Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Counsel for the

Respondent has admitted the fact that the Learned Magistrate has

flawed in making the impugned order, and should not be allowed

to stand. Further it is agreed that the Petitioner should only

operate the "Vawulagala Metal Quarry" situated at the

Bangalakakanda Estate, only having obtained the license, for the

above purpose, from the Central Environmental Authority and

from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau.

Thus it was submitted by the Counsel for the Respondent, the

vital Issue that remaInS for consideration IS the maintenance of

the road that leads to the Vawulagala Metal Quarry which IS In

a bad condition. It IS categorically admitted by the Counsel that

the Petitioner will undertake to repair the road that leads to the

Vawulagala Metal Quarry and maintain same In a

suitable for the use of the villages in the said area.

In the above setting it IS agreed by both parties that oiJers of

the Learned Magistrate dated 17.10.2012 and 12.12.2014, and the

order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 12.02.2015b to be

set aside and the same is vacated accordingly.
