On 29th March 2007 the Petitioner was summoned by the Dean of Medical Faculty and informed

her to sign her attendance on the register allocated for "Academic Support Staff' members. By

letter dated 04.04.2007 the Petitioner was served with a warning by the Dean of the Medical

Faculty, that if she does not sign her attendance on the appropriate register maintained at the

Dean's Office, that he would take disciplinary action against the Petitioner. (P-28)

On 30.07.2007 the Petitioner was served with a show cause letter for alleged insubordination

alleging that the Petitioner holds as Academic Support Staff Post and that Academic Support

Staff members are required to sign their attendance in terms of a U.G.C decision dated

28.08.2006.

1st Respondent University at its 337 meeting had decided to suspend the Petitioner from service

and served with a charge sheet on 16.01.2008. (P-38) By letter dated 21. 01.2009 vice chancellor

of the 1st Respondent University informed the Petitioner the she had been found guilty of

changes I,II,III,IV,V,VI(2),VII and VIII and by council decision dated 02.12.2008, the

Petitioner's Service had been terminated with effect from 02.12.2008.

Being aggrieved by the said decision, the Petitioner had appealed against the said decision to the

University Services Appeal Board in terms of section 86 of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978.

By Judgment dated 25.09.2012 University Services Appeal Board dismissed the appeal of the

petitioner (document marked Z).

Being dissatisfied with the said decision the Petitioner has come before this court seeking inter

alia relief prayed under paragraphs (a)-(g) of the Petition.

The position taken up by the Respondents before this court was that, the Petition who was an

Assistant Statistician attached to the U.G.C does belong to B-04 salary scale but does not

characterize her post as one coming under Academic Staff Category. The Respondents have

admitted B-04 salary scale applies to "Academic Grades" but it does not apply exclusively to

Academic Grades. In support of the above contention Respondents have drawn the attention of

this court to the document marked R-1 by the Respondent which is U.G.C circular No 717 dated

23.09.1997. a document titled "Revision of salaries in the University system 1997- Conversion

Table", was attached to the said circular.

Page 1 of the said Table carries a heading "Academic Grades" and the salary code have been

identified as B-04. Page two of the same Table carries the heading "B Grades (others)" and the

salary code have also been identified as B-04.

Based on the above circular the Respondents have submitted

a) B-04 applies to Academic Staff but it also applies to employees who are not part of the

Academic Staff;

b) The mere fact that a person received a B-04 salary is not determinative of the fact that he

is a member of the Academic Staff.

The Respondents have further submitted that upon a clarification sought by the Registrar of the

University of Kelaniya, the Registrar of the U.G.C has clarified that the post of Assistant

Statistician is an Academic support staff position (P 29-b). Even though the above letter confirms

the post of Assistant Statistician belongs to academic support staff position, the Respondents

have further clarified that the Petitioner who does not engage in academic activity can still be

confirmed in the academic staff, provided she satisfies the stipulated criteria crucially the

requirement of obtaining a two years post graduate degree.

The Respondents have further argued that the level of obedience expected from an employee is

such that they must even comply with instructions which may not be strictly correct and

reasonable and the conduct of the Petitioner to brazenly and high- handedly disregard the orders

of her superiors would amount to insubordination which under any stand or system will be

viewed as a very serious offence.

However the Petitioners argument before this court was mainly based on decisions conveyed to

the Petitioner by the U.G.C and correspondence between the Petitioner and U.G.C which

confirms the position that the petitioner is not belonging to the Academic Support Staff.

In support of the above contention the Petitioner had submitted that, with the approval of the new

scheme of recruitment in respect of Statisticians/ Econometricians and Assistant Statistician

Grade I and Grade II Assistant Statisticians were placed on a new salary scale namely BS-02

which is an Academic Support Staff leaved salary scale. However, according to the Petitioner

the new scheme was only operative with effect from 01.08.1992, and therefore had no impact on

the Petitioners terms of employment as the Petitioner was recruited prior to the said date.

With the introduction of the new scheme the U.G.C by its letter dated 28.04.1993 offered the

Petitioner the option to be considered as Academic Support Staff. The first paragraph of the said

letter reads thus,

"The commission at its 343rd meeting held on 14th January 1992 decided to offer the Research

Assistant and Assistant Statisticians of the planning and Academic Support Staff. If they do

decide to option, the same rules and regulations governing the confirmation of Academic

Support Staff will apply. Please let me know your decision very early regarding the decision of

the Commission."

Petitioner has filed before this court as P-5 her reply to the said letter where she had informed the

U.G.C that "she wishes to remain as an Academic Staff."

By letter dated 24th May 1993 which is produced marked P-6a the then chairman U.G.C had

written to the Petitioner and three others as follows. "All of you have now opted to remain on the

(academic) B scale salary. This requires you to obtain a postgraduate degree in the relevant filed

for your confirmation and promotion ...... "

In response to the above letter, the petitioner had informed the U.G.C that she had obtained a

Postgraduate Diploma in Applied Statistics. However the U.G.C by letter dated 22.06.1995

(P-6b) refused to consider the same as an adequate qualification for the reason that "since this

post carries the same status as that of a member of the academic staff in the B-04 grade"

Petitioner has marked as P-7 a new U.G.C circular issued on 14th November 1995 with regard to

Recruitment, confirmation and Promotion of Lectures/ Senior Lectures and corresponding

Library staff and under paragraph 2, it deals with "confirmation of a Probationary Lecture" as

follows;

A Lecturer (probationary) shall be confirmed in the post on fulfilling the following requirements;

a. Three years of satisfactory service as a lecturer in the permanent cadre

b. A relevant post graduate qualification obtained after a full-time cause of study of at least

one academic year or an equivalent part- time course of study

NOTE: the postgraduate qualification referred to in (b) above could be Master's Degree,

Diploma or equivalent ...

6

This court further observes that the Petitioner by letter dated 06.02.1996 requested the U.G.C to

consider her confirmation on the basis of the said circulate and thereafter the Commission by its

letter dated 18.11.1996 confirmed the Petitioner with effect from 30.01.1992 in Assistant

Statistician grade II.

However the Learned Counsel for the Respondent had challenged the said letter before this court

and argued that, nowhere in the circular are the words "academic staff' used. This was a circular

of the U.G.c. dealing the recruitment, confirmation and promotion of Lectures, Senior Lectures

and corresponding Library staff.

The circular marked no reference to statisticians Learned President's Counsel's reliance to this

circular is disingenuous. The section he relies on is section 2A (b) which states that the

postgraduate qualification required can be a diploma. A diploma is all that the Petitioner

possesses. But the title of this section speaks about the confirmation a probationary Lecturer and

it says nothing about confirmation to the Academic Support Staff who are keen to be confirmed

in the academic staff.

However this court observes the final paragraph of P- 6b to the effect "You are Kindly requested

to satisfy above requirement for the purpose of considering you for confirmation in the post of

Assistant Statistician Grade II and of the view that the U.G.C had informed in no uncertain terms

that she would be confirmed in her post only if she satisfies the required qualification. Therefore

when the Petitioner requested to consider her confirmation based on P-7 and the U.G.C

confirmed her in the post of Assistant Statistician by P-9 cannot be disputed now, and this court

is satisfied that the U.G.C has confirmed the Petitioner, in the Grade she opted to be, by her letter

P-5b.

This court further observes that, when the Petitioner was transferred to the Kelaniya University

by P-lO, there is specific reference that, required finances will be made available based on her

grade to the effect "2rl <i>~8",~ ~o6)~) <i'C6)2n~ %i)2n2:i1<i'~ aa~:h(2n (8 -04) ~~ ~aro ~~2ne<i'~

<i'e.ro2fi) ~oQm)D~ 'll2:i1ezsf 2fi)6~ el.<i'S>."

According to the petitioner since August 1997 she was signing her attendance on the

Administrative Register as she was assigned to the Vice Chancellor's office. There was no

objection by anybody including the then Registrar her signing in the said register. However when

Mr. Karunarathne was appointed the Registrar in March 2006, he had ordered the Petitioner to

sign her attendance is a new register separate from the Administrative Register. The Petitioner

7

submitted that she was the only member of the staff to whom this separate book was allocated to.

However the Petitioner continued to sign on both book including the Administrative Register as

she feared that the loss or interference with such separate book would put any record of her

regular attendance in doubt. By P-12 the Registrar has ordered her not to sign in the

Administrative Register since she is holding a post which entitles to a 'B' grade salary and to

sign in the register provided to her.

The court observed this document as an unusual letter, since he has taken trouble to send this

handwritten letter to the Petitioner, without following the proper procedure to communicate such

directive.

The Petitioner had submitted before this court a series of events which followed, according to the

Petitioner, a result of Petitioner's refusal to concede to certain advances by the said Register, but

we are not going to address our mind to such instances since our role is limited in this

application. However we are mindful of the fact that the Petitioner made several attempts

thereafter to obtain a transfer from the said University but was unsuccessful as evident in

document produced marked P-13, P-14a, P-14b and P-15.

As I have discussed earlier the Petitioner was seconded with effect from 2.10.2006 to the

Medical Faculty of Kelaniya and was attached to the Department of Community Medicine.

On 16th March 2007 the Dean of the Medical Faculty on directions he received from the Vice

Chancellor and the Registrar of Kelaniya University had written to the Head of the Department

of Community Medicine, directing him to hand over the attendance register of the Petitioner to

the assistant registrar's office with a direction to the Petitioner to sign at the register at the

assistant registrar's office. This court observes that this is the starting point of the dispute which

arose between the Petitioner and the University Administration over signing of attendance by the

Petitioner. As observed by this court it is the Registrar of the University of Kelaniya who

directed by an unusual letter the Petitioner to sign a separate register when she was signing her

attendance in the Administrative Register since she is holding a post which entitled to a 'B'

grade salary. The same registrar thereafter called for the separate attendance register used by the

Petitioner to sign her attendance by withdrawing it though the Dean of the Medical Faculty, and

thereafter got her to sign in the register used by the support staff.

8

If the Petitioner cannot be allowed to sign the Administrative Register, since she is holding a

post which entitled to a 'B' grade salary, the same principle will apply to her when she is asked

to sign the register, which is used by persons who are not entitled to a 'B' grade salary. The

Learned State Counsel who represented the respondents had argued before this court that level of

obedience expected from an employee is such that they must even comply with instruction which

may not be strictly correct and reasonable and then complain to the authorities of his or her

grievance rather than brazenly and high handedly disregard the orders which would amount to

insubordination.

When go through the document marked P-26, P-27 , P-28, P-30a, P-30b, P-31, P-32, P-33 and P-

34 it is clear that the Petitioner has repeatedly requested a proper register for her to sign her

attendance but the authorities have refused her requested and forced her to sign the register used

by persons who are not entitled to a 'B' grade salary. Instead of finding an answer to her request,

the authorities have gone to the extent of obtaining a clarification from U.G.C whether the post

of Assistant statistician belongs to Academic Support Staff. We observe that the authorities have

suppressed important facts in the said letter and therefore the ruling they obtained in document

marked P-29b has no value.

In the case of Ceylon Estate Staff's Union V. Superintendent Meddecombra Estate (1970) 73

NLR 278 at 288 Weeramanthry J observed, "there is of cause no general principle that an

employee is in all cases bound to accept such a transfer order under protest, for there may be

cases where the mala- fides prompting such an order is so self- evident or the circumstances of

the transfer so humiliating that the employee may well refuse to act upon it even under protest."

This court observes that the Petitioner on several occasions requested the authorities to

appreciate her status as a person who is not belonging to the Academic Support Staff but the

Respondents have failed to satisfy this court that the said requests were even considered when

the impugned decisions are reached. This court further concludes that, the U.G.C by its conduct

specially by sending P-5a, P-6a, P-6b, P-9 and P-lO confirmed to the Petitioner that she is not

belonging to "Academic Support Staff' any further and therefore it is wrong for the Respondent

to terminate the services of the Petitioner without giving due consideration to the above facts by

reaching a conclusion that the petitioner is guilty of allegations of misconduct and

insubordination, all arising from the refusal by the Petitioner to sign attendance on the Academic

Support Staff Register, to which she is not belonging to, as evident from the material placed

before this court.

For the reasons set out above I conclude that the petitioner is entitled to all the relief claimed

against the Respondents and therefore decides to grant relief prayed by the Petitioner in

paragraph (b) - (e) of the Petition.

I further direct the 15t Respondent to pay sum of Rs. 500,000/- as compensation to the Petitioner.
