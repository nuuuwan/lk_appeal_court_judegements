Vijith K. Malalgoda,PC. J. (PICA)

Heard Counsel in support of this application. Counsel for the

appellant at this stage submits that the Accused- appellant was 18 years

old school boy when this incident has taken place. The victim who was the

first cousin of the accused was only 13 years at that time. After trial the

learned High Court Judge had imposed a sentence of 3 years Rigorous

Imprisonment on each count and made them to run concurrent with a fine

of Rs: 5000/- on each count and Rs: 25,000/- compensation. According to

the counsel, the accused is now gainfully employed at a private firm and if

he is sent to jail he will be ruining his entire life. The victim is also now

over 20 years of age and they are relatives. Learned SSC. appearing for the

Attorney General submits that he will leave the matter of sentence in the

hands of Court. We feel that this is a fit case to re-consider the sentence

considering the age and the other circumstances in this case. We also feel

that this is a fit case to follow the decision in SC Rule No: 03/2008 decided

by their Lord ship in the Supreme Court. After considering all the

submissions, we decide to impose a sentence of 2 years Rigorous

Imprisonment on each count and suspend the above sentence for a period of

5 years. That three sentences are to run concurrently, Counsel for the

appellant further submits that the accused had already paid up all the fines

and compensation. But we decide to impose an additional fine and

compensation. Accused is fined a sum of Rs: 10,000/- additional fine for

each count and in default there is another period of six months simple

imprisonment. In addition to the above, he is ordered to pay additional

compensation of Rs: 100,000- with the default term of one year to the

victim. Subject to the above variation the appeal stands dismissed.

Registrar is directed to forward this order along with the brief to the

High Court of Colombo in order to implement the above order.
