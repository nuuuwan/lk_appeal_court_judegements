This is an application for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

certiorari to quash a quit notice issued under State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act N 0.07 of 1979 (as amended). (Hereinafter referred to as

the Act) The Petitioner has entered in to an agreement with the 1 st

Respondent Board for granite mining for 15 years in a block of land

situated within the Haragama farm of the 1 st Respondent. The Petitioner

states that he, after obtaining permission from relevant authorities and

spending a large sum of money, commenced the granite mining. He says

that he continued paying annual rentals to the 1 st Respondent. After few

years, before completing 15 years, the 2nd Respondent has asked the

Petitioner to vacate the premises and hand over the possession of the quarry

to the 3rd Respondent. After certain negotiations, the 2nd Respondent has

issued a quit notice under the Act. Petitioner's contention is that he is in

authorized occupation on the strength of the agreement and therefore a quit

notice cannot be issued against him.

The Respondents' position is that the land where the mining is done

is a state land and therefore under the State Land Ordinance only the

President can grant a long term lease. The lease agreement entered in to

with the Petitioner is bad in law. They further argue that the lease

agreement is not a N otarialy executed document and therefore is not

enforceable and is not valid in law. The Respondents' contention is that the

Petitioner is in unauthorized occupation.

The Petitioner came in to the occupation ofthis land on the strength

of the agreement entered in to by the parties is an admitted fact. The

Petitioner describes this agreement as a commercial agreement and the

Respondents' argument is that it is a lease agreement. The agreement is

marked as PIa. The Respondents leased out a block ofland to the Petitioner

to extract granite form the rock situated in the land for 15 years. The

Petitioner has agreed to pay an annual rental to the Respondent. Therefore

this is a lease agreement in relation to an immovable property.

The lease agreement says that the land owned by the 1 st Respondent.

In the objections they say that they have come to know that it is a state

land. The Petitioner does not contest the fact that it is a state land. The land

was handed over to the pt Respondent by the State for the purpose of

breeding cattle. Under this situation, the 1 st Respondent has no authority to

lease out a portion of the state land for granite mining. On the other hand

only the President of the country can grant a state land on a long term lease.

The lease agreement marked PIa is not a valid agreement.

On the other hand, if the land belongs to the 1 st Respondent, section

2 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance comes in to play. The lease

agreement marked PIa is only an informal agreement and not attested by a

Notary Public, as prescribed by law. Therefore, the lease agreement is not

valid in law and cannot be enforced.

Under section 3 of the Act, the competent authority can issue a quit

notice only if he is of the opinion that the person to be evicted is III

unauthorized occupation. The section reads thus;

3. (1) Where a competent authority is of the opinion

(a) that any land is State land; and

(b) that any person is in unauthorized possession or occupation

of such land, the competent authority may serve a notice on

such person in possession or occupation thereof or

The Petitioner came in to the occupation of this land on the strength

of the lease agreement, with permission of the 3rd Respondent, the manager

of the Haragama farm. Accordingly, he is not a trespasser. But the

agreement itself is bad in law. Therefore, even if he is not a trespasser, he

cannot be considered as an authorized occupier, but only a licensee. Once

the 1 st Respondent realized that the agreement is bad in law and they have

no authority to enter into such an agreement, they have canceled the license

and asked the Petitioner to vacate the premises. The 1 st Respondent Board

has informed the Petitioner by letter marked P 9 that the agreement is bad

in law and he has been requested to hand over the possession to the 3rd

Respondent. From that point onwards the Petitioner becomes an unlawful

occupier. In such an instance, the state can utilize the provisions of the State

Land (Recovery of Possession) Act to regain the possession of the state

land.

Ihalapathirana v. Bulankulame, Director-General, U.D.A. [1988]1

Sri L R 416 is a case where the Petitioner was appointed as Manager of the

Chilaw Rest House by the U.D .A. under section 5 of the Rest House Act.

The Petitioner had to make a monthly payment to the U.D.A. as agreed,

but failed to continue the payments regularly. Even after several reminders

he could not make the payments as agreed. The U.D.A. canceled the

agreement and resorted to the provisions of the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act and issued a quit notice. The Court held that;

Land vested in the UD.A is state land. A Rest House is state

property. Possession of it 'without a permit or other written

authority' is unauthorized possession. The State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act can be used to secure eviction without recourse to a

civil action.

In the case before us also the land is a state land. The license given

to the Petitioner to occupy the same is canceled. The Petitioner is in

occupation without any valid permit or written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law. As such, the provisions of the

Act can be used to secure the eviction.

The unauthorized possession or occupation is interpreted in the Act

as follows;

"unauthorized possession or occupation" except possession or

occupation upon a valid permit or other written authority of the

State granted in accordance with any written law, and includes

possession or occupation by encroachment upon state land.

The lease agreement marked PIa cannot be considered as a written

authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law. It is

really a document not in accordance with any written law. Therefore the

Petitioner cannot claim that he is in occupation upon a written authority.

For the foregoing reasons, I dismiss this application.
