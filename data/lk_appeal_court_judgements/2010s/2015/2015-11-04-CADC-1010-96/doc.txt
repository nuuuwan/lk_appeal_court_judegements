In favor of the Plaintiff- Respondent.(herein after sometimes called

_ and referred to as the Plaintiff.)

The Plaintiff instituted the above styled action, inter alia;

For a declaration of title to the land more fully described Iii

schedule to the plaint,

For an order, ejecting the Defendants from the land in suit and place

the Plaintiff in peaceful possession of the said disputed property.

The factual matrix In relation to the Plaintiff's case are as follows;

The original owner of the land In Issue was one Abraham Elesinghe,

by virtue of the judgment and decree in the case bearing No. 1815

in the Court of Request Ratnapura. The said Elesinghe died intestate

without having an estate to be administered, and his son the Plaintiff

became entitled to the land in issue, and had been in possession

more than ten years. In the year 1988.04. 17 said Elcsi::lgl:c had

entrusted one Lineris to look after the said land. On 1990.11.12 the

Defendants had entered the said land, cut the produce of the land.

On 1990.11.12 the Defendants had forcibly entered the temporary

house in the said land. The Plaintiff has complained to the police

and the Defendants had admitted the fact that they did in fact

entered the land in Issue.

As a comprehensive response to the above claim the Defendants

had stated the following;

That the original owner of the land described in the schedule to

the Answer, was one Mahadura Witharanalage Salonchi and after his

demise one Labuna became entitled to the land, and after his demise e the Defendants became entitled to the land in issue.

The parties formulated the contested issues based on the above

pleadings and proceeded to trial. The Learned District Judge

considering the facts surfaced at the trial, entered judgment and

decree in favour of the Plaintiff.

The plaintiff in adducing evidence III the above trial had marked a

document as P5, which is the judgment III the case bearing No.

1815, by which judgment the plaintiffs father became entitled to the

land in the schedule suit property. Subsequently by virtue of the

deed marked PI the plaintiff became entitled to the said property,

as the other owners to the land had given their share to the

Plaintiff by the afore said deed.

By the document marked P3, the plaintiff has made a complaint

to the police regarding the forcible entrance to the disputed land,

by P4 the complaint made by the person who was l00!-:.ing aft~f

the land III issue, was considered by the Learned District Judge

and was of the view that the Plaintiff has proved title with stark

evidence, and on the contrary the Defendants has failed to prove

any title to the land III suit.

Further as per documents marked P7,P8,P9, and PI0 it IS established

that the Defendants were residing at a different place and not in the

land in issue. Therefore the Learned District Judge was of the view

that the evidence adduced by the 15t Defendant is not trustworthy. In

addition the statement made by the 15t Defendant was marked as

I

P 11, according to which, the house situated in the land was rented

out. But her evidence in court was that she was in occupation of

this house and was in possession of the said land.

In the written submissions tendered by the counsel for the Appellants

contended that the Plaintiff has not taken a commission to prepare

a plan for the purpose of identifying the land in issue. But it is

the position of the Plaintiff that as per Decree entered on 10.02.1944,

in the case No. 1815 the Plaintiff's predecessor. the said Abraham

Illesinghe was declared entitled to the land in schedule called

Lunulandadehena situated at Kolonna. The Plaintiff adverted court to

the fact that the East, South, and the Western boundaries and extent

mentioned In the decree and the schedule to the plaint are similar.

Further it IS said the said boundaries are similar to the boundaries

in the schedule to the title deed marked PI. Therefore the Plaintiff

asserts that he has a clear title to the land in suit. Thus it is

abundantly clear that the disputed land is identified as the land

possessed by the plaintiff, and as such is entitled to the same.

It is pertinent to note that the 2nd Defendant in the above case IS

the father of the I5t Defendant in the present ~cti()n; ~nd it 1"

stated by the plaintiff that the Defendant cannot deny the title of

the Plaintiff.

The Appellants further assailed the title of the Plaintiff by stating

that the Plaintiff's predecessor has not taken the possession of the

land In suit. It is further noted that after entering the Decree in

case No.I81S, in favour of the Plaintiff, to recover damages awarded

to the Plaintiff, the Defendants lands were sold in execution of the

5

,

decree and the Plaintiff himself has purchased the lots 1 to 11 gIven

III the Sale Report dated 19/3/1945.

In the above context the Defendants appeal to set aside, the

impugned judgment of Learned District Judge is devoid of merits,

and should stand rejected.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed cost fixed at Rs.5000/.
