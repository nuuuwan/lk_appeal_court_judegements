M.M.A. Gaffoor J

Originally the Plaintiff filed this action by his plaint dated

22.07.1981 against the Defendant for:

(i) declaration that he is entitled to the land described in

schedule III to the plaint;

(ii) to eject the Defendant and all those claiming under him

to be ejected therefrom and to give possession to him;

(iii) to order the Defendants to pay the 2nd Plaintiff a sum of

Rs. 1000/- as damages;

(iv) to order the Defendant to pay Rs. 30/- per month as

damages from the date of the Plaint until possession of

the land is given and for costs;

The Defendant has filed answer denying the averments in 2-10

paragraphs of the Plaint and suggested that to identify the land claimed

by the Defendant and the Plaintiff a survey plan and Report are

necessary after such plan and Report, he may be allowed to file a full

answer. He has relied on prescriptive right to the said land. After a long

delay with regard to commission to survey the land in dispute, a

commission had been issued and a Plan No. 269 dated 14.02.1990 and

Report dated 20.03.1990 by W.N.Silva, Licensed Surveyor are filed of

record.

On 02.101971 trial had commenced, plaintiffs have raised 6 Issues

and the Defendant raised 7-12 Issues. After the Plaintiffs and their

witnesses evidence was closed and the case was awaiting the defendant's

evidence, on 28.07.93, one Pambure Dhammadassi Himi had applied to

intervene in the case which was allowed by court. He is named s the 2nd

Defendant, who in his answer dated 27.10.1993 claimed right to the

disputed land by some deeds and also suggested for a commission to

survey the land.

On 14.3.1996 when the case was taken up for further trial before

the successor to the earlier District Judge, parties agreed to proceed

with the trial from the stage it was stopped before the Judge's

predecessor and the Plaintiff raised a further issue as Issue No.8. That

is : Is the land claimed by the Defendant and the land claimed by the

Plaintiff one and the same land?

The trial Judge delivered the judgment on 24.06.1998declaring

the Plaintiffs are entitled to the land described in the 3rd schedule to the

plaint and damages at Rs. 30/- from the date of the Plaint until

possession is given to them and ejectment of the 1st Defendant and all

those claiming under him from the said land. Accordingly decree has

been entered on 06.10.1998.

Being aggrieved by this judgment, the 1st Defendant only has

preferred this appeal. The 2nd Defendant has not preferred an appeal.

The groufl(kof appeal are mainly about the procedure followed by the

District Judge in recording the evidence of the parties and the witnesses.

It must be noted that the plaintiff's evidence oral and documentary and

the evidence of this witness was recorded not by the Judge who

delivered the judgment but by his predecessor. Only the Defendant's

evidence and his witnesses evidence was recorded by the incumbent

Judge. It must also be noted that when the incumbent judge commenced

hearing of the case, all parties agreed to adopt the evidence already led

and to proceed therefrom to further trial. The 1st Defendant at that

stage did not make an application about the ground urged in

paragraphs 5(a), (b) and (h) of the petition of Appeal and ask for trial

de novo. Hence, the reasons urged in paragraphs 5(a),(b) and (h) cannot

be accepted as valid grounds. These are mere technicalities.

The main contest is about the identity of he land in dispute.While

the Plaintiff say that their land is known by the name "Udalanda" the

1 st and 2nd Defendants claimed that the land they are entitled to is

"Udalanda Hena". In this respect, the Plan and Report and the oral

evidence of Surveyor Wilmot Silva is very clear. He has said that the

land depicted as Lot 1 in his Plan No. 269 dated 14.02.1990 is the land

described In the 3rd schedule to the plaint which is known as

"Udalanda" .

The learned District Judge hs carefully analyzed the oral and

documentary evidence relating to the identity of the land and has come

to the correct finding that "after considering all the evidence, I

determine that the subject matter of the action is lot 1 in Plan No. 269

dated 14.2.1990 of Licensed Surveyor Wilmot Perera, containing in

extent lAcre 2 Roods and 20 Perches." See pages 6,7 of the judgment

Having identified the land in dispute which is morefully described

I the 3rd schedule to the Plaint as the land known s "Udalanda" the next

question arises whether parties have established their title to the said

land.

The 1 st Plaintiff in claiming title to this land by documents

marked P2 and P3. The 1 st Plaintiff is the father who allowed his son the

2nd Plaintiff to cultivate the said land. While the land being possessed by

the 2nd Plaintiff, the 1st Defendant in the year 1973 had forcibly entered

the land and thereby ousted the Plaintiffs therefrom. The 1st Defendant

has admitted in his evidence that he came into the land in dispute in

1973, and claim right to the land by prescription, But in 1981, the

Plaintiffs have instituted the action ..... ... in the District Court of

Moneragala. By filing this action the Defendant has failed to establish a

continuous and uninterrupted prescriptive possession as stipulated in

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

Whilst the Plaintiffs claimed right to land called "Udalanda" by

P2 and P3 which refer to services rendered as "Hevisi" duties to the

Monrawana Keerthi Bandara Devalaya by their predecessors in title,

the Defendants claim right to a land called "Uda;ada Hena" by

prescription. The learned District Judge, had carefully analysed the

evidence of the witnesses summoned by the Plaintiffs and the evidence

of the witnesses summoned by the Defendants and arrived at a finding

that the land called "Udalanda" and land called "Udalanda Hena" are

separate and distinct lands, and answered the issues 1-6 raised by the

plaintiffs in the affirmative and the Issues 7-12 raised by the 1st

Defendant in the negative and the subsequent issue raised on 14.3.1996

to the effect whether the land claimed by the Plaintiffs and the land

claimed by the Defendant is one and the same? In the negative.

After considering evidence of the Defendants as against the

documentary title of the Plaintiffs, the learned District Judge has clearly

decided that the 1st Defendant has not proved uninterrupted and

undisturbed possession for 10 years and he is not entitled to prescriptive

rights.

IN an action for declaration of title to property, where the legal

title is in the Plaintiff but the property is in the possession of the

Defendant, the burden of proof is on the Defendant - See. Siyaneris vs

Jayasinghe Udenis de Silva 52 NLR 289(PC) . In the present case, the

Defendant has failed to establish his prescriptive right for over 10 years

as the law demands.

In the circumstances, I agree with the findings of the learned

District Judge that the Defendant Appellant had not acquired

prescriptive title to the land morefully described in the 3rd schedule to

the Plaint.

This action has been filed on 22nd July 1981 which is almost 34

years ago. The counsel for the Defendant Appellant in his written

submissions has requested to dismiss the Plaintiff's action or in the

alternative to order are-trial.

For the reasons stated above, I decline to accept both these

suggestions. It is not advisable to order re-trial after 34 years, which

might take considerable time.

Furthermore, the grounds set out for re-trial are untenable. I

therefore dismiss this appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 25,000/-.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Wijesundera J.,

I agree.
