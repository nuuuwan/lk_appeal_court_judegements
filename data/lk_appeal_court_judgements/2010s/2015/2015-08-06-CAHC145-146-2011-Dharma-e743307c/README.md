Accused-appellants are present in Court produced by the Prison

Authorities.

Heard Counsel for all three accused-appellants and also the

learned Additional Solicitor General on this case. This case refers to a

case of double murder which took place on 30.04.1990 at Danattawala

a village in Tangalle High Court division. The two deceased are namely,

Sahabanduge Siripala and Siriwardane Arachchige Ajith were taking

part at a religious ceremony followed by an arms giving on this

particular day. The said arms giving was organised in memory of one

Ariyadasa who has died three months ago. The two deceased referred

to this indictment are relatives of Ariyadasa. There were two

prosecution witnesses called by the prosecution at the High Court trial

namely, Anura Kumara and Harishchandra who are cousins of the

deceased Ariyadasa. According to them there was a pirith chanting at

this house and after pirith chanting was over the witnesses had seen

the 1 st accused calling the two deceased and another person by the

name Kalumalli outside the house. It was further evident that the 1 st

accused and his family members were actively taking part at this event.

They were in the house of Ariyadasa more than a day helping the family

members to organise this event. However, according to the witnesses

once the two deceased were taken out, there was a commotion outside

the house. In addition to the above two witnesses there was another

witness by the name of Piyasena who was not summoned by the

prosecution. It was submitted that Piyasena was in fact the first

complainant in this case. Piyasena was called as a defence witness and

even Piyasena in his evidence refers to a commotion outside the house

of Ariyadasa. It appears from the entire evidence placed before the

learned High Court Judge that none of the witnesses were able to

exactly say what really took place. But instead they referred to a

commotion outside the house with the involvement of several outsiders

including the three accused. Witnesses Harishchandra and Anura

Kumara speak of the fact that the 1 st accused taking the deceased

outside the house and they also refers that they have identified the 1st,

2nd and 3rd accused among the crowd who attacked the two deceased.

According to the prosecution witnesses due to fear they ran out of the

house. But later found Ajith's body at the hospital mortuary on the

following day morning and the deceased Siripala was in the hospital

with serious injuries. The learned Counsel for all the three accused-

appellants submitted before this Court that the learned trial Judge has

failed to consider the evidence of all the witnesses who referred to a

commotion outside the house of Ariyadasa. Even though the trial Judge

had referred to this in his judgment on several places he has not given

his mind whether there was a commotion or a sudden fight which

resulted the death of two persons. The fact that the 1 st accused and his

family took part in this religious ceremony is supportive of the version

of the defence. The learned trial Judge has failed to appreciate the

above facts in his judgement. However, it was transpired from the

evidence that the two deceased were taken out from the compound of

Ariyadasa and they were in fact attacked at an abandoned land. The

two deceased had received several injuries and according to the post-

mortem report of Sahabanduge Siripala there were twelve injuries

found on his body including eight cut injuries. Six on left scalp and

face and two on right scalp. A depress fracture of the skull was

observed on the body of the deceased Siriwardane Arachchige Ajith and

according to the post-mortem report the brain substances have come

out due to the said injury. It appears from the above two reports that

the two deceased were brutally killed by whoever is responsible for the

killing of those two. However, what is important to this Court to

consider at this point is, whether there was a commotion or a fight

between the two deceased and for the reason that the 1 st accused was

actively taking part in the house of Ariyadasa without an iota of

evidence to show that there was previous enmity between the two

parties. The learned Additional Solicitor General too agreed that the

learned trial Judge has failed to appreciate this aspect in his judgment

but requested the Court be mindful of the brutal act which resulted the

death of the two deceased in this case.

When considering all these matters placed before this Court we are

of the view that this is a fit and proper case to convict the accused on

culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of sudden

fight. But we also mindful the injuries caused to the accused during

the so called brawl took place at the house of Ariyadasa. Considering

all these issues we decide to set aside the conviction for murder

imposed by the learned High Court Judge and convict the all three

accused-appellants for culpable homicide not amounting to murder

based on sudden fight and impose a jail term of 15 years rigorous

imprisonment on counts 2, 3, 4 and 5 on all the three accused-

appellants. We further made order to run the said sentences

concurrently. We will not change the sentence already imposed on the

1 st count which will run consecutively to the rest of the sentence. We

4 II r

also considered the fact that the accused-appellants are in remand

since the date of conviction, namely 14.12.2011 and make order to

operate the said sentence with effect from the date of conviction.
