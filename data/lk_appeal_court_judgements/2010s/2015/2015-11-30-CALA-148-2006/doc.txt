M.M.A. Gaffoor J.,

The Plaintiff has instituted this action on 20.05.2005 In the

District Court of Colombo aginst the defendant for eviction of the

defendant and all those holding from the premises in suit on the basis

that the Common Law monthly tenancy under which the premises was

let to the defendant had been duly terminated and for damages. Both

the plaintiff and the defendant are limited liability companies and

therefore it is agreed between the parties that the premises in suit is an

excepted premises, and the provisions of the Rent Act No. 07 of 1972 do

not apply, on the basis of the regulation published in the Gazette Extra

Ordinance No.1305/17 of 09.9.2003. It is also admitted that the

tenancy of the premises in suit commenced prior to January 2003 and

prior to the said Regulation.

a rent controlled premises, an fundamental principle of the

subsection (5) of Section 2 of the Rent No.7 of 1972 ( as mended

thereafter) and published in the government Gazette Extra -Ordinary

No.1303/ 17 of 09.09.2003 is applicable to business premises and has re

respective effect in respect of the tenancy in this case"

In this regard, the date of the commencement of the tenancy the

date of the said Regulation and the date of the filing of the plaint in this

case are relevant.

It is admitted by the parties that the premises in suit was let to the

defendant in January 2003 which is before the said Regulation was

published in the Gazette on 09.09.2003. The plaintiff has filed this

action for ejectment and damages against the defendant on 20.05.2005.

It is settled law that the right of parties are decided at the time of the

institution of this action. In the case of Eastern Hardware Stores

Vs.J.S.Fernando 58 N.L.R. 568 at page 570. Sinnathamby J. said" rights

of parties have to be determined as at the date of action and this court is

deciding issues arising in a case do so only on evidence relating to facts

which excited before the date of action. This is an elementary rule of

Law."

Since the plaint has been filed on 20.05.2005, the rights of parties

in this case have to be decided on the facts and law that prevailed before

the date of action. In this regard the date of the regulation is material

which is 9th September 2009. As it is, long before the date of action.

The law has been amended by the regulation. According to which, if the

landlord is a company registered under the companies Act No. 17 of

1982 and if the tenant is a company which is registered under the

companies Act No. 17 of 1982, the premises shall be a excepted

premises.

In the instant case, it is an admitted fact that both the landlord (

the Plaintiff) and the tenant ( the defendant) are registered companies

under the Companies Act No.17 of 1982 and therefore, the parties and

the premises have become subject to the regulation and as such the

premises in suit is an excepted premises in terms of the said regulation,

which the court can take judicial notice of under Section 57 of the

Evidence Ordinance.

Sub Section (5) of Section 2 of the Rent

Act states that, " The Regulation in the schedule to this "Act shall have

effect for the purpose of determining the premises which shall be

excepted premises for the purpose of this Act, and may be amended from

time to time by regulation made under Section 43. The said regulation

No.1305/17 dated 09.09.2003, has been brought in terms of Section 43

read with Section 2(5) to amended the Schedule to the Act in order to

make certain premises as " excepted premises". Though the effective

date of the regulation, it can be presumed that it may be the date of

publication of the regulation i.e. 09.9.2003. (vide Section 43 (2)

subsection (2) of the Section 43 states that , "Every regulation made by

the Minister shall be published in the Gazette and shall come into

operation on the date of such pUblication or on such later date as may be

specified in the regulation". Hence, the date of coming into operation of

the regulation is deemed to be 09.9.2003 and as such the contention

that the regulation has retrospective effect cannot be accepted.

" When the substantive law is altered during the pendency of

action, the rights of parties are decided according to the law as it excited

when the action was begun unless the statute shows a clear intention to

very such right" Per Soza J in Lechman & Co.Ltd. Vs. Rangalla

consolidated Ltd. 189 (2) Sri Lanka Law Report 373.

Since the regulation clearly altered the law as the rights of Parties

In respect of the premises in suit, which has become an excepted

premises in terms of the regulation, the rights of parties must be decided

in terms of the regulation and not otherwise. The regulation does not

relate back to the date of commencement of the tenancy in this case. The

regulation is prospective and at the time of this institution of this action,

to regulation is in force. The plaintiff has instituted this action on the

basis that the premises in suit is an excepted premises. As the

regulation was in force on the date of the institution of this action, the

law that is applicable to this action are provisions of the Regulation

No.1305/17 of 09.09.2003, Accordingly the plaintiff can maintain this

action.

In view of these findings the rest of the matters need not be gone

into. The application for leave to appeal is dismissed and the case is

remitted to the District Court for further trial on the other issues.

Application is dismissed.
