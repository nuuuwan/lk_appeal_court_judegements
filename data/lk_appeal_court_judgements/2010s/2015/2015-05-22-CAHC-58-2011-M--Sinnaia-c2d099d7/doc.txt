Heard Counsel in support of this a~C~n.

At the out set, the Counsel for the accused appellant submits that he

will not be challenging the conviction of this case but will be

canvassing the sentence only. According to him, the accused-

appellant in this case was a 27 years old married man at the time

when the offence was committed. The victim was a 13 year old girl

living in the same area. The evidence was that the accused had taken

the girl away from her house to Welimada area and stayed at a place

.-known to him for two days until they,ti'apprehended by the Police.

The accused's version was that he eloped with the girl due to a love

affair he had with the girl. However, the girl admits having a love

affair with the accused but, submits that on this particular day she

never went with the consent but she was taken in a van by the

accused after giving some toffees. However, the learned Counsel for

the accused-appellant submits the evidence of two witnesses, van

driver and the owner of the house in Welimada area where both of

them have said that they never suspect that the girl being taken

without her consent. According to the medical evidence there were no

fresh hymenal tare found on the victim but, there were two old tares

found. Pprosecutrix in her evidence had denied any previous sexual

relationship with the accused. Learned Counsel for the accused

appellant's position was that the victim was trying to hide the fact

~N;. that she/having an affair and a sexual relationship with the accused

even prior to her eloped with the accused. Learned Deputy Solicitor

General submits that the girl was only 13 years when she was taken

by the accused who was 27 years of age and a married man.

Contention of the learned Deputy Solicitor General was that he has

taken the advantage of the minor age of the victim. We agree with the

submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General on this issue.

We are mindful of the submissions made by the learned Deputy

Solicitor General and Counsel for the accused-appellant as well. After

considering all these issues, we are of the view that we should not

interfere with the sentence imposed on: the custodial sentence

imposed on count one and count two but decide to make order to run

LC!JV\ C LA. '\I-yI..e. "1\.1 S both sentences cgnsecutively. The accused was ordered a fine of Rs.

7500/- and a compensation of Rs. 50,000/- in default terms of 08

months rigorous imprisonment on the fine and 04 years rigorous

imprisonment on the compensation.

We make order that the default term on the fine to remam as 08

months but make it a simple imprisonment. The default term on the

compensation IS reduced to a period of two years simple

imprisonment. Subject to the above variation, the sentence will

remam.

At this stage, Counsel for the accused appellant makes an application

under Section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code to consider

imposing the sentence from the date of the conviction. We make

order to commence the date of the sentence of 12 years rigorous

imprisonment with effect from the date of conviction that is from

01.08.2011. Both sentences to run concurrent from that date.

Subject to the above variation the appeal stands dismissed.

We order the Registrar to return the record to the High Court of

Badulla in order to implement the above sentence.
