VIJITH K. MALALGODA PC J(P / CAl

The Accused-Appellant in this case was tried in absentia in the

High Court of Kegalle. The record indicates that the Accused -

Appellant was absent right throughout the case and the case

proceeded without him. At the conclusion of the trial Learned High

Court Judge has found him guilty and he was sentenced to death.

After the pronouncement of the said judgment on 19.05.2004 the

Accused was apprehended by authorities and produced before the

same High Court on 24.11.2011 six years after the said conviction.

On that day he was represented by a counsel and when the Court

inquired him for reason to his absence, under Section 241 (iii) of the

f I. I

~ j

2

Criminal Procedure Code, the position taken up by the Accused was

that he was unaware of warrant issued against him. The Accused had

not taken any step to explain his absence beyond that. However the

learned Counsel representing the Accused-Appellant before this court

submits that when the 241 (i) inquiry was proceeding in the High

Court, the prosecution had called for the evidence of a Gramasevaka

who was not in charge of the area the Accused was living prior to his

disappearance. Counsel submits that when the Accused left the area

he informed the relevant Gramasevaka, the area he is going to stay

but due to the above mistake i.e. failure by the prosecution to call the

correct Gramasevaka, the correct facts were not placed before the High

Court. The said decision to proceed in absentia was made without

proper material being placed before the Court. However we observed

that the wife of the Accused-Appellant too was summoned at the said

241 inquiry before the Learned Trial Judge. We further observe that

when the Accused-Appellant was apprehended in 2011 and produced

before High Court he has not taken up this position i.e. the position

taken up by the counsel before this court.

The learned Trial Judge being dissatisfied with the position

taken up by the Accused-Appellant on 24.11.2011, on 22.02.2012

made an order to the effect that she cannot accept the position taken

up by the Accused-Appellant. Therefore decided to impose the death

3

sentence already imposed on him after giving him an opportunity to

make his allocutus. We see no reason to interfere with the findings of

the learned High Court Judge. Therefore we dismiss the appeal.

H.C.J. Madawala, J I agree.
