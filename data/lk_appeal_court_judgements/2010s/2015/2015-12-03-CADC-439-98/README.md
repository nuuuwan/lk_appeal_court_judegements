The plaintiff respondents instituted an action against the

defendant appellants seeking a declaration of title to the land described

in the schedule to the plaint and ejectment of the defendant appellants.

After trial the learned District Judge has delivered the judgment on

03/03/1998. Being aggrieved by the said judgment the defendant

appellants have filed the instant application.

The appellant's learned counsel argued that the case in the

District Court commenced before one District Judge and concluded by

2

another. When the learned District Judge who delivered the judgment

heard the case on 26/06/1997 it was recorded that the parties agree to

adopt the evidence so far given and to proceed with further trial. The

appellants stated that the defendants were unrepresented by counsel on

that day and though it was recorded that both defendants are agreeing

to adopt evidence and are signing the record only one defendant has

signed the record (JE of 26/06/97). The surveyor's evidence had been

recorded that day and he has not been cross examined by the defense.

Thereafter the plaintiff has closed his case and the defense was called

on the same day. The second defendant has given just one sentence of

evidence and has been cross examined by the plaintiff's counsel. The

defendant's case was concluded.

The argument of the appellant was that the district Judge should

have given a date for the defendants to cross examine the expert

witness the surveyor and granted a date for the defendants case which

is the usual procedure in any civil case. The appellant stated that the

District Judge has not given thought to the maxim "Actus Curie

nimenem Gravabit".

The appellant cited the judgment in Manamperi Somawathie

and buwaneswari 1990 1 SLR 223 and stated that when there is a

3

proxy given to an attorney-at-law it remained valid until the party dies or

till the action in concluded by judgment therefore all acts in a trial should

be done by the Attorney. He also cited the judgments in Seelawathi vs

Jayasinghe (1985) 2 SLR 266 and also Jinadasa and another vs

Sam Silva and others (1994) 1 SLR 232 which have no relevance to

the instant application.

The appellant also stated the trial in the District Court was

postponed several time due to various reason for which they were not

responsible. (JE 25 to JE 35).

The appellant further argued that the action filed by the

respondents in an action for declaration of title and ejectment and that

he has to prove his title to the land and if he fails to do so the action

should necessarily fail and that the plaintiff (the defendant) had nothing

to prove until the plaintiff (defendant) had discharged his burden of proof

and cited the judgment in Loku Menika and others vs Gunasekera

(1997) 2 SLR 287. It was stated in this above judgment that the plaintiff

must set out his title on the basis on which he claims a declaration of

title to the land and must in court prove that title against the defendants

in the action. The defendant need not prove anything still less his own

4

title. The same principle was discussed in D.A. Wanigaratne vs

Juwanis Appuhamy 65 NLR 167.

The counsel for the plaintiff respondents in his

submission stated that on 26/06/1997 the defendants agreed to the

adoption of proceedings and both defendants have signed the case

record and that though they said only one defendant signed the record it

is not so on perusal of the case record. (in page 28 of the Appeal Brief).

The respondents stated the appellants never objected to this adoption of

the proceeding in the district Court and that in their submission after the

conclusion of the trial no mention is made on this.

The respondents citing the judgment in Malani vs Somapala and

another 2000 (2) SLR 196 stated that if a party wishes to contradict the

record he ought to file the necessary papers before the court of first

instance and thereafter canvass the order before the Court of Appeal.

The respondents stated that the appellants having willingly taken part in

the legal machinery now cannot object to the conduct of the trial. He

stated that the appellants said position is merely an afterthought and

that he is estopped from taking up any objection due to their own

conduct.

On perusal of the journal entries of the District Court case record

It can be seen that an 26/06/97 the day further hearing of the District

Court case was resumed the defendants have agreed to adopt the

proceeding and one defendant has signed the case record the other

defendant has not signed but both have agreed to adopt the

proceedings. As stated by the appellants the defendants were not

represented by counsel. Surveyor's evidence has gone in unchallenged.

The appellants in their final submissions have not taken up the position

that the defendants were unrepresented by counsel when the

defendants gave evidence. In their submissions dated 29/07/1997 no

mention is made to this effect.

The appellants stated that the title deeds of the respondents were

not proved in the District Court. It is not so, the learned District Judge in

her judgment refers to the said deeds which were proved by calling

evidence. The District Judge did not fail to examine the title of the

plaintiff respondents concentrate on the weakness of the defense as

stated by the appellants. The learned District Judge has carefully

analysed the title of the plaintiff respondents.

Most of the judgments cited by the appellants in support of their

arguments are totally irrelevant to the instant application. The appellants

6

having neglected their rights to defend their title is now trying to bring in

new material to justify their negligence. The maxim "Actus Curie

Nimenem Gravabit" - An act of the court shall prejudice no man applies

to the plaintiffs as well as the defendant. The negligence of the

defendant should not prejudice the rights of the plaintiff. In the instant

case the plaintiff has given evidence and called expert evidence as well

as documentary evidence some of which has gone in unchallenged by

the defense which is not the plaintiffs fault.

For the afore stated reasons I see no reason to allow the

application of the appellant. The appeal of the appellant is dismissed

with costs fixed at Rs. 10,000/=. The judgment of the District Court

dated 03/03/1998 is affirmed.
