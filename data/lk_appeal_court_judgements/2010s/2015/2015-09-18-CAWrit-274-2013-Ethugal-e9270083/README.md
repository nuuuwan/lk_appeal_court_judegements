********

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC.J. (PICA)

In this matter, the 2nd and 3rd respondents have filed a motion

dated 06.08.2015 informing that in view of the fact that the 5th

respondent is deceased now they will not be able to implement

the request made by the 5th respondent and therefore the

application rendered futile, even if other parties wanted to obtain

the connections. However counsel for the Petitioner informs that

she has no instructions from the petitioners to withdraw this

application. Considering the motion filed by the 3rd and 4th

respondents, we see no reason to have this matter pending before

this Court any further. We therefore make order to dismiss the

application. No costs is ordered.
