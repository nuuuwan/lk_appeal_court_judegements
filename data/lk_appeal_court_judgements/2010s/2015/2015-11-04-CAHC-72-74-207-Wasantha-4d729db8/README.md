sentence of ten years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of

Rs.10,000/-. With regard to the 5th count only the 5th accused was

convicted and sentenced for 10 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine

of Rs. 10,500/-With regard to the 7th count the 2nd accused was

convicted and imposed the sentence of fifteen years ngorous

imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 52,500/-. With regard to the 10th count

the 5th accused was convicted and imposed a sentence of two years

rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 2500/-. With regard to the 11th

count only the 4th accused was convicted and imposed a sentence of

When all the sentences are taken together the 2nd accused was

convicted for the 1 st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 7th counts. The 3rd accused was

convicted for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd counts only. The 4th accused was

convicted for the 1 st, 2nd,3rd and 11th counts. The 5th accused was

convicted for the 5th and 10th counts only. The Counsel submits that

the learned High Court Judge had not made a specific order with regard

to the operation of the said sentences and therefore the said sentences

are being considered as consecutive terms. The submissions by the

learned counsel before this Court was that, considering the long period

of time they have been incarcerated that is since their conviction on

21.02.2007, move that the Court to make those sentences to run

concurrently. Counsel further requests this Court to consider to make

order to operate the said sentences from the date of conviction i.e.

from the 21.02.2007. Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant further

requests the Court to consider a nominal deduction of the sentence

already imposed on the accused considering their long in incarceration.

Learned Additional Solicitor General submits that he has no objection

submissions of the learned Counsel for a reduction of the sentence. We

are also mindful of the fact that the nature of this offence and of the

view that this is not a fit and proper case to consider a reduction of

sentence.

Considering all the submissions made by Counsel for both sides this

Court make the following order:

The sentence imposed on all the accused (2nd to 5th ) who are before

this Court to run concurrent and therefore the 2nd accused will have

to serve a period of 15 years. The 3rd accused to 8 years. The 4th

accused 15 years and the 5th accused 10 years. The fines and the

default terms already imposed will remain unchanged. Considering the

submissions made by the Counsel for both parties we make further

order to operate the said sentences with effect from the date of conviction

that is from 21.02.2007. Subject to the above variations of the sentence

the appeal stands dismissed.
