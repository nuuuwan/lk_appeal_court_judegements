Heard counsel in support of this application as well as counsel for

the Respondents.

The Petitioner has come before this Court against a order for

Parate Execu tion under the Recovery of Loans by Banks (Special

Provisions) Act No. 04/1990. The position of the Petitioner is that the

Supreme Court in the case of Ramachandran Vs. Hatton National Bank

had decided that the 3rd party borrower should not be penalized.

However, we found that there are several decisions by the Supreme

Court and also by the divisional Bench of this Court against and for the

above decision. By looking at those decisions we found that each case

had decided on the facts and circumstances of those cases. In the

present case it is placed before this case that the Petitioner who is the

Managing Director of Vehicle Lanka Pvt. Ltd. is the principle shareholder

of the said company. The Directors of the said company are the petitioner

and his wife. Respondent in their limited objections have submitted 28

documents, correspondence between the petitioner and the bank where

the Petitioner had borrowed money on several instance for his business.

It is understood on the above correspondence that the petitioner being

the principle shareholder was involved in borrowing money and therefore

we see that the circumstance of this case defers to the circumstances of

the facts in Ramachandran Vs. H.N.B. which was decided in year 2006.

In these circumstances, the Court is of the view that this is not a

fit and proper case to issue notices on the Respondent and therefore we

refuse notices in this application.

Registrar is directed to issue a certified copy of today's proceedings

to both parties on payment of usual charges.
