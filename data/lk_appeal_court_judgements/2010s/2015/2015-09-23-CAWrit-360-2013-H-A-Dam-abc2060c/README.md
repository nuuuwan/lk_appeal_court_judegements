RESPONDENTS

b. issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st ,2nd and 3rd Respondents

to rectify the error and/or mistake appears in the Grant marked P-2

One Dewatha Pedigedara Edwin of Nissankamallapura was issued with a permit under the Land

Development Ordinance in respect of a Land in Nissankamllapura to the extent of two Roods and 10

perches in the year 1997. In the year 1999 Her Excellency the then President issued a grant in respect of

the said land to the said Dewatha Pedigedara Edwin, which is produced marked P-2.

3

The said land has been identified as the allotment of land bearing No 710A depicted in the Surveyor

General Plan bearing No q.~.~. 3950 which is produced marked P-3 in the said Presidential grant.

The Petitioner has become the lawful owner of the said portion of land by Deed of Transfer No 1520

attested by Siripala Ranathunga Notary Public and the said Deed of Transfer was prepared with the

written permission obtained from the divisional secretary Thamankaduwa by the said Dewatha

Pedigedara Edwin who was the lawful grantee of the said Land.

According to the Petitioner, the said land had been identified in the 15t schedule to the said deed in the

same manner, as it referred to in the said Presidential Grant.

The Petitioner's position before this court was that he permitted a known couple( 4th and 5th

Respondents) to occupy the said land, but later when he got to know some surreptitious conduct of the

said 4th and 5th Respondents, demanded them to vacate the said land and to hand over the vacant

possession to the Petitioner.

Since the 4th and 5hth Respondents refused to vacate the said land, Petitioner has filed an action in the

District Court of Polonnaruwa seeking to eject them from the said Land.

When the said action was pending before the District Court of Polonnaruwa, the Petitioner has realized

that the lot number referred to in the Presidential grant and the subsequent deed of Transfer from which

the Petitioner claims title, mistakenly typed and/or printed as 710A but the correct number should be

728.

When the said discrepency was detected, the Petitioner has taken steps to withdraw the District Court

Action with liberty to file a fresh action, once the lot numbers are rectified and thereafter requested the

Grama Niladhari of the area to issue a certificate confirming his position. Accordingly the Grama

Niladhari has issued a certificate which was produced marked P-7 on 12.11.2011. Since then several

representations were made by the Petitioner to the 15t and 3rd Respondents but his request had not been

implemented. The said correspondents are evinced from the documents produced before us marked P-9

to P-14.

The inquiries had been held by the 2nd Respondent and the 3rd Respondents representative and

according to P-l1, a letter addressed to 3rd respondent by his representative and also by P-12 letter

signed by the 2nd Respondent it is admitted a rectification is necessary and in fact the 2nd Respondent

had admitted forwarding the necessary documents to the representative of the 3rd Respondent on

29.12.2011 for necessary action.

When this application was filed before this court, the Learned State Counsel who appeared for the 1st to

3rd Respondents have informed that he would not be filing any objections on behalf of the 1st to 3rd

Respondents and would be abiding by the decision of this court.

When going through the document submitted before this court by the Petitioner (they were not

challenged by the Respondents) it is crystal clear that the mistake had taken place when the Original

grant was made to Dewatha Pedigedara Edwin. Until it was revealed in the District Court, the parties

were under the impression that the correct lot number of the said land is 710A but, it should be lot No

728.

4th and 5th Respondents were not represented before this court but from the document produced marked

P-12 and P-13 it is evident that the 4th and 5th Respondents were not issued with any permit and they

are illegal occupants.

Considering all these issues court decided to grant the relief prayed by the Petitioner in prayer "b" of

his Petition and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1S\2od and 3rd

Respondents to rectify the error and/or mistake appear in the Grant marked P-2.
