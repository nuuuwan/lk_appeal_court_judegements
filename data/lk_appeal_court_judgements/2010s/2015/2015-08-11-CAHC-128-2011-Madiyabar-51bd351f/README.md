DECIDED ON 27.07.2015

Vijith K. Malalgoda, PC. J. (P / CAl

The Accused-Appellant in this case, one Mahiyabranam

Nesakandan is indicted before the High Court of Vavuniya for criminal

intimidation on the learned District Judge, Vavniya for a charge

punishable under Section 486 of the Penal Code. The Accused

Appellant is absent right throughout this case and this court on

numerous occasions since May,2012 has sent notices to get him

down but he has not responded to the said notices. Therefore we

decides to consider this matter and take a decision. Learned Senior

State Counsel appearing for the Attorney General has submitted the

facts of this case before this Court. We have carefully gone through

the said material submitted by the learned Senior State Counsel and

we found that there is no material before us to conclude, that the

'\

decision of the learned High Court Judge is erroneous. Therefore we

have no reason to interfere with the decision of the learned High Court

Judge. The Learned High Court Judge convicted the accused

appellant and sentence him for a two years Rigorous Imprisonment

which was suspended for a period of 10 years. While imposing the

said sentence, the learned High Court Judge was mindful of the fact

that the Accused-Appellant had a clear record before, and also the fact

that he was in remand for period of one year pending the trial before

the High Court. We see no reason to interfere with the said conviction

and sentence and, we therefore dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
