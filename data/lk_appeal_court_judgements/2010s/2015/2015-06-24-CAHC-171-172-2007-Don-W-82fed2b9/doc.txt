Both Accused-Appellants in this case were indicted in the

High Court of Ampara on a count of attempted murder.

Both counsel appearing for the Accused-Appellants had

informed that at the outset that they would not be challenging

the conviction in this case but would only be canvassing the

1

i

f,

sentence imposed. According to them, the incident had taken

place on the 05.06.2004 at a place called Galwanguwa in the

District of Ampara. The injured in this case was a cashier

attached to the Multi Purpose Co-operative Society of Ampara.

The 1st Accused was an interdicted store keeper of the same co-

operative Society. During the time the incident took place he was

having a shop closer to the work place of the injured. On the

day in question the first Accused had invited the injured to join

with him, so that he could drop him at his place after the work.

The injured after his day's work met the 1 st Accused and on his

invitation got into a three wheeler which was driven by the 2nd

Accused. They have proceeded for some distance and half way

through the 1 st Accused had purchased some liquor and a bottle

of beer. They were taking the drinks on their way and according

to the witness the three wheeler had diverted it's way and went

towards a jungle area. Closer to a place called Galwanguwa the

2nd Accused had stopped the three wheeler and indicated that he

could not drive any further. At this stage the 1st Accused had

taken the wheel whilst the 2nd Accused decided to come and sit

with the injured. According to the injured, when the 2nd accused

came and sat with him, all of a sudden he realize that the 2nd

2

Accused is causing an injury to his neck. This had happened

within few seconds. The movement he release this, he got down

from the three wheeler and ran on the road calling for help. For

his fortunate, there was a police barrier in a close proximity and

the police officers at the barrier had come for his rescue. The

three wheeler proceeded on the road without the orders of the

Police but one Police Officer had managed to chase behind the

Three Wheeler in a Motor Cycle and manage to apprehend the 1 st

Accused at a place about 1 Y2 k.m., away from the place of the

incident. The 2nd Accused had surrendered to Uhana Police at

10.00 p.m. on the same day. The position taken up by the two

accused were that they never intended to commit any offence on

that day and it was not a pre planed attack on the injured. In

support of their position, the counsel brings to this notice of this

Court, that the weapon used is only a part of a paper cutting

blade which is 5 Y2 c.m. by 2 c.m. This blade had been recovered

on a section 27 statement made by the 2nd Accused. The counsel

further submits that the 2nd Accused was not identified at the

parade which was held few days after.

The position taken up by the both Counsel for the Accused-

Appellants were that the injury caused to the Accused is only a

3

injured was discharged after treatment from the hospital on the

following day. Under these circumstances, the Counsel submit

that a sentence of 16 years imposed on the two Accused are

excessive and move that the Court to reduce the sentence to a

reasonable term. However, the learned Additional Solicitor

General whilst objecting to the said application submitted that

this was a pre planed act. According to him the 18t Accused was

facing a disciplinary inquiry at that time and had to pay back a

large sum of money to the co-operative Society. His position was

that the motive for this offence was in order to take money from

the safe of the co-operative Society. According to the witness, the

witness was having the key to the room where the safe was kept

and one key for the safe was also with him on that day.

Eventhough, the witness refers in his evidence for two keys, he

has not specifically said that the both keys were necessary to

open the safe. However, the fact that both the room key and one

key for the safe was with the injured is an admitted fact. The

position taken up by the learned Additional Solicitor General was

that the 18t accused was searching for the injured from around

3.00 p.m. on that day, making inquiries about the injured and

finally met him after his office hours and offered a lift to him,

saying that he will drop him at home. Half way through the

deviated their journey, consumed some liquor and went towards

a jungle area. The incident had taken place under these

circumstances and he further submits that eventhough, the

Medical Report indicates only a superficial cut on the neck of the

injured, the Doctor has specifically said in his evidence that this

injury is in serious nature because, it is10 c.m. cut injury right

across the neck. When considering the submissions made by

Counsel for both parties, we are mindful of the facts place before

this Court by the learned Additional Solicitor General to the effect

that the injured in this case had a narrow escape on this

occasion and for his fortunate there was a Police barrier in the

close proximity to the scene of crime. Under these

circumstances, we observe that the learned trial Judge had

reason to impose a sentence of 16 years. But however,

considering the fact that the Accused-Appellants had decided not

to canvass the conviction before us, without wasting the time of

this Court, we decide to reduce the jail term imposed on both

Accused-Appellants up to 14 years R.I. The rest of the sentence

will remain uncharged and we further make order to implement

the said sentence from the date of conviction that is from

22.06.2007. Subject to the above variation in the sentence, the

appeal stands dismissed.

Registrar is directed to forward the record to the High Court

of Ampara in order to implement the sentence.
