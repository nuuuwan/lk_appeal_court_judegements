Vijith K. MaJaJgoda PC J (PICA)

Petitioner is a limited liability company registered under the provisions of the Companies Act No.7 of

2007. In June 1993 One Mr. S.P.U.S. Wickramasinghe was granted a manufacturing license for Country

made Foreign Liquor (FL 1A) by the lSI Respondent. The said license was transferred to the Petitioner

Company with effect from 22.10.1993. Accordingly the Petitioner Company was issued with a license to

manufacture Country made foreign Liquor and for the sale of the same by the lSI Respondent.

Having obtained the said license the Petitioner commenced its operation and continued till year 2000.

Petitioner submitted that due to financial constrains faced by the company in the year 2000, for several

reasons including reduction of sales in certain parts of the country, the Petitioner decided to inform the lSI

Respondent that it was unable to continue with its operations in the year 2001. This decision was

conveyed to the lSI Respondent by letter dated 20.11.2000 (P 11).

Petitioner further submits that in the year 2004 the Managing Director of the Company, said Mr. S.P.U.S

Wickremasinghe wrote to the Hon. Minister in change with a copy to the lSI Respondent, that the

Petitioner has found finances to commence its operation and seeking that the license be renewed. (P12).

The lSI Respondent had informed the Managing Director of the Petitioner Company, that steps would be

taken to issue a FL 1A license to the petitioner but since issuance of licenses had been suspended during

the election period, steps would be taken to issue the same once the elections are over. (P-14)

Petitioner's allegation before this court was that the said lSI Respondent had failed to issue the said

license contrary to his own decision which was conveyed to him by letter dated 10.08.2005. (P-14)

Petitioner further submitted that instead of issuing the license the lSI Respondent time to time gave

different reasons, as evident in document produced marked P-19, P-22, and P-24 and therefore the

Petitioner has come before this court seeking inter alia;

b). issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent not to

renew the manufacturing license of the Petitioner as stated in P-19,P-22 and P-24.

c). issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the 1st Respondent to act according to

law and to renew the said manufacturing license as undertaken by the 1st respondent in his letters P-14

and P-17.

However the position taken up by the 1st Respondent before this court was that he was unable to issue FL

1A license to the Petitioner due to the directive he has received from His Excellency the President and the

Finance Minister which was produced marked 1R1.

According to document 1R1 dated 5th December 2005, a decision was taken by His Excellency the

President and the Finance Minister not to issue permits with effect from 28.11.2005 for

1. Sale of liquor licenses

2. Manufacture of liquor licenses

3. Distilleries licenses

4. Manufacture of sprit licenses

And it was conveyed to the Secretary -Finance and the

1 stRespondent by the Secretary to His Excellency the President by 1R1.

The Petitioner has responded to the above argument, mainly on two grounds. Firstly he had taken up the

position that the request of the Petitioner was to renew the license already issued to him and not for a new

license and therefore as admitted by the 1st Respondent in P-26, question of issuing a new license won't

arise and therefore 1R1 has no application to his request.

Secondl y he argued that the 1st respondent had treated him differently by granting manufacturing licenses

to Globe Blenders and Wayamba Distilleries (Pvt) Ltd.

I would now consider the first ground raised by the Petitioner before this court.

As admitted by the Petitioner from his own document P-11, the Petitioner has only made use of the

license issued to him up to April 1996, even though he was issued with a Manufacturing license up to

December 2000. In other words, the Petitioner was involved in commercial production only between

January 1993 to April 1996 even though he possessed a manufacturing license up to December 2000.

Since January 2001 the Petitioner was not issued a manufacturing license by the 1st Respondent. The

Petitioner by sending P-ll reserved his rights to review his request once he found necessary funding, but

accepting a part of the said request by not issuing a manufacturing license, is not proof of the fact that the

1 st Respondent agreed to the request of the Petitioner to grant him a license once Petitioner found

finances.

The term Renewal of license is explained in Black's Law Dictionary Sixth Edition, .... A change of

something old to something new ..... " in P. Ramanathan Aiyar's "the Law Lexicon" (Reprint Edition

1987) the word "renewal" is defined at P 1107 to mean " a change of something old for something

new ...... ". The renewal of "License "means a new license granted by way of a renewal.

Therefore it is understood that a new license is required to be issued to the applicant and it is different to

the term extension which was discussed in the case of Provash Chandra Dalui V. Biswanath Benerjee

1989 Supp (1) SCC 487 as follows;

"A distinction between 'extension' and 'renewal' is chiefly that in the case of renewal a new lease

is required while the case of extension the same lease continues ..... "

In the present case the Petitioner has come before the 1st Respondent in year 2005 to renew the FL 1A

license issued to him for the year 2000 for the year 2006.

If the Petition has come before the 1st Respondent in 2001 and asked for renewal or, if he had a valid FL

1A license for the year 2004 and asked for renewal in 2005 the things would have been different to the

circumstances of this case, since the application is to continue with it operation and once he come before

the Authority, he has a legitimate expectation that the license will be renewed for another year.

Petitioner, other than by referring to certain letters sent by the 1st Respondent, on different occasions

giving different explanations, failed to establish before this court, that he has a legal right or at least a

legitimate expectation to renew his license issued to the year 2000 for the year 2006.

In the above circumstances this court cannot agree with the contention of the counsel for the Petitioner

that he is entitled to obtains a license for the year 2006 since he had a valid license issued to him for the

year 2000.

According to the lSI Respondent, he was unable to issue FL lA license to the Petitioner for the year 2006

due to the directive he has received from His Excellency the President.

It was argued on behalf of the 1 sl Respondent that the 1 SI Respondent was bound to implement the above

directive since that was issued based on the state policy prevailed at that time.

In the case of M.R. Leelawathie V. The Minister of Defence and External Affairs 68 NLR 487 at 489

Sansoni C.J discussed the questions of the Policy of the state as follows;

"The policy of the Government would presumably always be III accordance with the public

interest; the welfare of the State would be presumed to be the main object of Government of, the

Minister of Defence and External Affairs, and when she came to make a decision as to what was

in the public interest she would not be uninfluenced by the policy of the Government. Such policy

would be a proper and relevant factor to be taken into account."

Lord Diplock in the case of Council of Civil Service Union V. Minister of Civil Service [1985] AC

374 observed the function of court, when considering the implementation of Government Policy as

follows;

"Such decisions will generally involve the application of government policy. The reasons for the

decision- maker taking one course rather than another do not normally involve questions to

which, if disputed, the judicial process is adapted to provide the right answer, by which I mean

that the kind of evidence that is admissible under judicial procedures and the court competing

policy considerations which, if the executive discretion is to be wisely exercised, need to be

weighed against one another- a balancing exercise which judges by their upbringing and

experience are ill- qualified to perform."

As we observe, the government policies will change time to time, to ensure that the broader public

interest is served. When the lSI Respondent replied P-12, he informed the Petitioner that "issuance of

licenses had been suspended during the election period and steps would be taken to issue the same once

the elections are over."

Once the elections are over and with a forming of a new government, the Government policies can

change in order to ensure that broader public interests are served. In such a situation this court is

reluctant to annul a decision unless it is established before us, that the policy is manifestly unreasonable.

Petitioner has further argued that the 151 Respondent has granted licenses to certain other companies in

violation of the said decision by His Excellency the President, and therefore the Petitioner too is entitled

to renew his license. If the Petitioner is complaining of un equal treatment by the 151 Respondent, in such

a situation the best cause of action available to the Petitioner was to sought redress for the violation of the

Petitioner's Fundamental Rights. In a writ application Petitioner cannot rely on the grant of the license to

another company in order to claim a right for obtain a license to his company.

Petitioner has failed to establish that the 151 Respondent's decision to refuse of FL 1A license to him was

illegal, wrongful or ultra virus.

For the reasons adduced above, I am of the view that this is not a fit case for the granting of relief by way

of a Writ of Certiorari and Mandamus, and therefore I am not inclined to grant the relief prayed by the

petitioner. Application is accordingly dismissed with cost fixed at Rs. 10 000/=.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

H.C.J. MADAWALA,

I agree,

JUDGE OF THE CUORT OF APPEAL

Application is dismissed with cost.
