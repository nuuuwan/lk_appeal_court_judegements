CASE- NO- CA-I018/F JUDGMENT - 30/10/2015

P.R.Walgama, J

The Plaintiff- Respondent (herein after called and referred to as the

Plaintiff) instituted a partition action In the District Court of

Horana, to divide the co owned land more fully described in the

schedule to the plaint.

The land to be partitioned IS known as Praiya Ovita alias

Agalakapuwatta, was possessed by the predecessors m title as

stated in paragraph 2 of the Amended Plaint, and the said land

was sold by the said co owners to one Weerewagu Pullai and

Alawattage Podisira Fernando by Deed No. 10150 attested by

D.B.K. GUNATILLEKE, Notary Public.

It is categorically stated by the Plaintiff that the said Weerawagu

Pullai was an Indian and as such he had never possessed the

land sought to be partitioned, and did not havt: ht:l1s LV liit! title

In the above circumstances the said Alawattage Podisira possessed

the said land for 40 years without any interruption and

disturbance from any party.

The said Podisira Fernando died leaving Alawattage Jemis

Fernando, and per averment 5 of the Amended Plaint it is said

the that Alawattage Jemis had conveyed Y-t share of the land to

a third party, which has been possessed by the 4th Defendant.

The said Jemis Fernando died leaving the Plaintiff and the 1 st ,2nd

and 3rd Defendant. In the afore said circumstances the 4th

Defendant has been allotted Y-t share and the Plaintiff and the 1 st

to 3rd Defendants are been allotted 3116.

The Learned District Judge by his judgment dated 01.06.1998 has

allotted shares only to the Plaintiff and 1 st 2nd and 3rd Defendant

and not the 4th Defendant- Appellant. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment the 4th Defendant -Appellant has appealed to this Court

6

and sought to set aside the said impugned

decree accordingly.

The parties to this action has formulated 19 Issues, to be

resolved at the trial. In that it IS intensely relevant to note that

the Plaintiff has framed the Issue No.3 on the basis that Plaintiff

IS entitled only 3116 share, and by the 3rd Issue IS that the

balance portion should be divided among 1st 2nd , 3rd and 4th

Defendants as stated In the Amended Plaint.

Therefore according to the afore said Issues it IS abundantly clear

that the Plaintiff has admitted that the 4th Defendant was also a

co owner of the land sought to be partitioned.

The 4th Defendant- Appellant by his Amended Statement of Claim

has admitted the facts stated In the paragraph 5 of the Amended

Plaint, in that it is stated that Weeravagu Pullai who became

entitled to 'i2 of the land sought to be partitioned, and his rights

had been devolved on Charlis and Dominee. Further in paragraph

4,5,6,7, 8 and 9 the 4th Defendant -Appellant has demonstrated a

di fferent pedigree and parties, entitled to the land.

As per preliminary plan in lot No. 1 it is clear that the Rubber

plantation was possessed by the 4th Defendant and not by the

Plaintiff or other Defendants to this action.

In addition to the afore said that Plaintiff In his testimony to

Court has stated that the Rubber plantation with 320 Rubber

trees are been possessed by the 4th Defendant - Appellant.

But it IS his contention that the 4 th Defendant - Appellant has no

title to this land, and has forcibly entered the

1~~...l --,... ........... r. ldUU 111 l;:'.,U~.

But nevertheless he has admitted that the 4 th Defendant

Appellant was In possessIOn of lot Nol and was enJoYIng the

Rubber plantation.

The stance of the 4th Defendant -Appellant IS that the

entire land was possessed by him, but same has not

been established by the 4th Defendant -Appellant to that

effect.

It IS also to be noted that as per surveyor's report marked

Xl, it IS stated that in lot No.1, the Rubber plantation IS

been enjoyed by the 4th Defendant Appellant, there tore it IS

abundantly clear the 4th Defendant - Appellant should be allotted

the Y4 share that was admitted by plaintiff by his amended

plaint.

The Learned District Judge has dealt In his impugned order that

the 4th Defendant-Appellant has failed to prove his title by not

producing the Deeds marked 4 V2, and also the deeds to prove

the sale of the purported land to his predecessors, in title and

as such has held that the 4th Defendant -Appellant is not entitled

to a share in the land sought to be partitioned.

Thus In adumbrating the facts stated above

that the Plaintiff himself has admitted the fact that 4th

Defendant- Appellant was In possession of lot No. 1 wherein he

8

had enjoyed 320 Rubber plantation, which fact has been

ignored by Learned District Judge In the alleged impugned

judgment.

For the above compelling reasons I allow +h"

f"')-r'It. .......... '" 1 n~,.l 'II ,,... ...... ' ~. '-' ut't''-', .. u.i.lu " ..... J

the said impugned judgment, by allocating Y4 share to

the 4th Defendant Appellant. Hence it IS decreed that

shares be allotted as per amended plaint dated 10.09.1993.

Appeal IS allowed subject to the above variation. We

order no costs.
