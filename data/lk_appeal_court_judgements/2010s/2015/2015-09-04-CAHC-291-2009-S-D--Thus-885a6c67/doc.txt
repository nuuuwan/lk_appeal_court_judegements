Accused-appellant is present in Court produced by the

Prison authorities.

There are two accused-appellants in this case and out

of them the 2nd accused-appellant is represented By Mr.

Chandrakantha, the assigned Counsel. On 6th August 2015, this

Court has received a letter from the Prison Authorities informing

that the 2nd accused-appellant has already served the sentence on

11th May 2015. In the said letter the Prison Authorities have

further informed that they have been informed by the High Court

that since the accused-appellant had withdrawn the appeal, on

30th April 2010 the Prison Authorities have converted his remand

period to a jail term since then. However, when going through the

records, we find that neither this Court nor the High Court had

permitted the 2nd accused-appellant to withdraw this appeal.

However, at this stage the learned assigned Counsel for the 2nd

accused-appellant informs that he has instructions from the 2nd

accused-appellant to withdraw this appeal. Considering the

circumstances of this case and also the fact that he has served his

term already imposed since 30th April 2010 we decide to permit the

2nd accused-appellant to withdraw this appeal. The learned

Counsel for the 2nd accused-appellant at this stage makes an

application under Section 359 of the Criminal Procedure Code to

back date the sentence. After considering the circumstances of this

case, we make order to implement the sentence in this case from

the date of conviction i.e. from 9th December 2009. Subject to the

above variation, we dismiss this appeal

Appeal is accordingly, dismissed with regard to the 2nd

accused-appellant, Brahmanage Ranjith Perera. This matter is

already fIxed for argument on 30th September 2015. That date to

stand with regard to the other accused-appellants.
