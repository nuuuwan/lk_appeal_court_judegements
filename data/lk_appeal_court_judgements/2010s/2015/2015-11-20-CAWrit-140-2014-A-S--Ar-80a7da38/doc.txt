Order

Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The Petitioner who is a retired employee of the National Savings Bank has come before this court

seeking inter alia,

b. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the purported

charge sheet dated 11.04.2014 (P-14) issued to the Petitioner by the 1st and/or 10th

Respondent

c. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition Prohibiting the 1st

Respondent and/or any other Respondent and/or any other authority from proceeding

with the disciplinary inquiry initialed/ contemplated by the purported charge sheet dated

11.04.2014 (P-14) issued to the Petitioner by the 1st and/or the 10th Respondent

d. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Prohibition Prohibiting the 1st

Respondent and/or any other Respondent and/or other authority from taking any further

disciplinary action against the Petitioner in pursuance of the purported charge sheet

dated 11.04.2014 (P-14)

e. Grant and issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus compelling the 1st

Respondent and/or any other Respondent and/or any other authority to release the

Petitioner's retirement benefits forthwith

Petitioner's position before this court was that he served in the National Savings Bank (NSB) for 33

years and upon reaching the compulsory age of retirement he duly retired with effect from 26.08.2013.

At that time he was serving as the Manager of the NSB Ratnapura Branch.

Petitioner has further submitted that few days pnor to his retirement, he found that a fraudulent

withdrawal of Rs. 500000/- had been made from customers account. Immediately thereafter, the

Petitioner infonned the Audit Department of the NSB of the said fraudulent withdrawal and requested to

4

conduct an inquiry and consequent to the said complaint, Audit Department conducted an inquiry into

the matter and the Petitioner assisted the said investigation.

According to the Petitioner, two days after his retirement i.e. on or around 28.08.2013 he duly handed

over the Ratnapura Branch of NSB to his successor namely one D.S. Daluwatte, and submitted that

during the handing over process it was revealed that a file containing several "fixed Deposit

Certificates" of a deceased customer namely K.K. Ramachandran could not be found. When inquiring in

to this it was revealed that the said file had gone missing since 29.07.2013. The said matter was

immediately informed to the area manager and the subsequent inquires revealed that on 23.08.2013 the

relevant fixed deposit had been wrongfully transferred to an account bearing No.100100687219. By his

letter dated 30.08.2013 requested the Zonal Manager of the NSB to call for an inquiry into the said

matter by the Audit Department.

Petitioner learnt that after an inquiry held by the Audit Department with regard to the Fixed Deposit

issue, an employee of the Ratnapura Branch namely Athula Pushpakumara had been interdicted and

several others were transferred out of the branch but denies making any statement to the Audit

Department in the said inquiry (paragraph 8 of the Petition).

Since the 1st Respondent bank failed to grant his retirement benefits, the Petitioner has written to the 10th

Respondent requesting his retirement benefits by letter dated 11.11.2013 (P-8) and thereafter a reminder

was sent to the said letter by letter dated 04.01.2014 (P-9) and a further appeal was lodged by the

Petitioner to the 9th Respondent on 06.02.2014. However the 10th Respondent issued the impugned

document P-14 on the Petitioner on 11.04.2014.

The Petitioners argument before this court was that he retired from his service from NSB on 26.08.2013

on completion of 60 years by operation of law. In support of his contention he has produced marked P-4

the authority granted by the Bank for his retirement and also drew our attention to the decision in

Wilbert Godawela V. Chandrasena and Others 1995 (2) Sri LR 338.

5

Petitioner further argued that the Respondents have never informed him that his retirement was subject

to Rule 21.3 of the disciplinary proceedings when Petition wrote to the 1st Respondent asking for his

retirement benefits. (P-8 and P-9) The 10th Respondent informed him by letter dated 17.01.2014 that his

request cannot be granted since an inquiry was pending with regard to a fraud taken place while he was

in service as the Manager Ratnapura Branch (P-lO).

According to the Petitioner the Respondents have served a charge sheet on him (P-14) 7 months after his

retirement and therefore he argued that no disciplinary action could be initiated against him since he was

retired and was no longer an employee of the NSB.

The Respondents have taken up the following position before this court,

a. That in view of the facts and circumstances of these matter disciplinary proceedings had

been 'contemplated' against the Petitioner at the time of his retirement, in terms of the

rules of the Bank.

b. The Petitioner has by his conduct acquiesced/ consented to his retirement being subject to

disciplinary proceeding and is estopped from challenging the same by way of this

application

The Learned Senior Counsel appeanng for the Respondents argued that in VIew of the facts and

circumstances of this case, it is understood that the disciplinary proceedings had been contemplated

under rule 21.3 of the NSB Rules in Disciplinary Management. The said rule reads as follows;

21.3 if an employee reaches the age of retirement while disciplinary proceeding are contemplated or

are in progress against him, his retirement will be made subject to such disciplinary action. A

disciplinary order that will be made subsequently would be in the nature of a cut in the pension

or in the gratuity, where necessary.

6

This court is of the view that unlike in a case of disciplinary proceedings are in progress, a situation

where disciplinary proceedings are contemplated, has to he understood by careful consideration of facts

and circumstances of the case

In support of the above contention the Respondents have relied on the decision in Peiris V. Wijesuriya

Director of Irrigation and Others 1999 (1) Sri LR 295

This court observes that, in the said case the Petitioner was a storekeeper in the Irrigation Department

incharge of Rambawewa Stores. When the Petitioner complaint of the loss of the stock book, the stores

in his charge were sealed and a stock verification was conducted and a shortage amounts to Rs. 373,

958.41 were reported. The Petitioner was interdicted with effect from 29th September 1986. The

Petitioner reached the age of 55 years on i h August 1987 and was retired from the public service by

letter dated 20th November 1987 The Additional Director of Irrigation informed the Petitioner that the

Petitioner had been retired subject to Rule 12 of the minutes of Pension.

Rule 12 (3) of the minutes of Pension reads as follows;

"where the explanation tendered by a public servant against whom, at the time of his retirement

from Public Service, disciplinary proceedings were pending or contemplated in respect of his

negligence, irregularity or misconduct, is unsatisfactory by the competent authority the (relevant

authority) may either withhold or reduce any pension, gratuity or other allowances payable to

such Public Servant under these minutes."

It was argued in the said case that "not only was there inquiry but that such an inquiry was not

contemplate and that therefore retirement under Rule 12 was illegal, unwarranted, mala fide and in

excess of the power of the Respondents.

Amarasinghe (1) observed that, "stock verifications had revealed certain shortages and the Petitioner had

been interdicted in September 1986. There were no pending disciplinary proceedings but I am unable to

7

accept the view that the disciplinary proceedings were not "contemplated". What was the purpose of the

long drawn-out investigations except for the purpose of precisely ascertaining the losses and fixing

responsibility for such losses? This case was quite unlike Wilbert Godawela's case which Learned

Counsel for the Petitioner cited, in that case there were no disciplinary proceedings pending at the time

of retirement, no was such proceeding contemplated."

When facts and circumstances of the present case are considered I observe that the Petitioner himself

had complained of a fraudulent withdrawal of Rs. 500000/- few days prior to his retirement to the Audit

Department. Two days after his date of retirement, i.e. on 28.08.2013 while he was handing over his

duty to his successor, observed a loss of a file containing several Fixed Deposit Certificates of a

deceased customer and immediately informed to the area manager of the said fact.

Unlike in the case of Peiris V. Wijesuriya, the Petitioner was working as the Branch Manager until his

date of retirement, without any investigation pending against him. He retired on 26.08.2013 by reaching

his retiring age and thereby operation of Law as decided in Wilbert Godawela's case.

I further observe a clear distinction between the present case and the case of Peiris V. Wijesuriya.

Unlike in the case of Peiris V Wijesuriya, the alleged fraudulent acts were either reported few days prior

to the retirement of the Petitioner or few days after the date of retirement. By that time the Petitioner was

served with his pension letters and he was contemplating to go on retirement with all his pension

benefits. The Respondents did not communicate with the Petitioner until he wrote to the Respondents in

November 2013 and January 2014 asking for his pension benefits.

The Respondents at no stage prior to January 2014 or after that informed the Petitioner the suspension or

cancellation of P- 4 or disciplinary proceedings are contemplated under 21.3 of the NSB Rules in

Disciplinary Management.

Therefore I cannot agree with the contention of the Learned Senior State Counsel, that the facts and

circumstances of this case reveals that the disciplinary proceeding had been contemplated against the

Petitioner.

Respondents have further argued that the Petitioner by his conduct acquiescence/ consented to his

retirement being subject to disciplinary proceedings and is estopped from challenging the same by way

of this application.

In support of the above contention the Respondents submitted that the Petitioner participated at the

investigation which commenced a short while later to his retirement on 26.08.2013, i.e. on 11.09.2013

and voluntarily made several statements which was produced marked 2R3, 2R5, 2R6 and 2R7.

The Respondents have relied in the case of K. Nagalingam V. Lakshman de Mel 78 NLR 231 on this

objection.

In the said case the Petitioner who joined the Employers Federation at the age of 48 objected for his

retirement at the age of 60 since the letter of appointment did not stipulate any retiring age. When the

Respondent Federation appealed to the Commissioner of Labour under the provisions of Termination of

Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, an inquiry was held before the Commissioner of

Labour. The said inquiry which was commenced in September 1973 went on till March 1974 and finally

approval was granted to terminate his service with effect from 31st March 1974. When the Petitioner

moved court to quash the above proceedings, Sharvananda J (As he was then) observing the fact that,

"the Petitioner having participated in the prolonged proceedings without any objections and having

taken the chance of the final outcome of the proceedings, is precluded from raising any objection to the

jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Labour" and finally concluded that, "the Petitioner's right, if any,

to Certiorari has in the circumstances, been lost by his acquiescence or implied waiver."

..

In the case of State of Punjab V. Davender Pal Singh Bhullar AIR 2012 SC 364 it was held that,

acquiescence being a principle of equity must be made applicable where a party knowing all the facts

bias, etc surrenders to the authority of the court! tribunal without raising any objection. Inaction in every

case does not lead to an inference of implied consent or acquiescence. Thus the court has to examine the

facts and circumstances in an individual case.

As admitted in paragraph 9 and 10 (c) of the affidavit of the 2nd Respondent the Petitioner has reported

the two incidents in question by his letters dated 26.08.2013 and 30.08.2013 requesting the Audit

Department to conduct investigations with regard to these matters. When an investigation is

commenced, as the manager who was functioning at the time the said frauds taken place and also as the

complainant the Petitioner was bound to make a statement and lor statements. This court observes that Ithe said statements were recorded during an investigation and not during a disciplinary inquiry against

Ihim. The disciplinary inquiry as observed is the case of Nagalingam V. Lakshman de Mel only !

commences with the serving of the charge sheet P-14 to which the Petitioner had objected and had come

before this coun.

I therefore conclude that the Petitioner is entitled to the relief claimed in paragraphs (b ), (c), ( d), (e) and

( i ) of his Petition and make order granting the relief prayed for in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of the

Petition with cost to be paid to the Petitioner fixed at Rs. 500001-
