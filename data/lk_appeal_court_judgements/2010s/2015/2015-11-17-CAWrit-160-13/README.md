Hearing on Preliminary Objections 13.01.2015

Written Submissions by both parties : 01.04.2015

Decided on 16.10.2015

A.H.M.D. NAWAZ, J,

The Petitioner who is a qualified medical officer seeks several mandates in the

nature of writs of mandamus in respect of entitlements which the Petitioner claims

in her petition are due to her. The respective mandates are to the following effect-

(a) A writ of mandamus directing anyone or more of the Respondents to

place the Petitioner as a Grade II Medical Officer at her entry point to the

Public Service.

(b) A writ of mandamus directing anyone or more of the Respondents that

the Petitioner be appointed to Public Service based on the concession

specified in Section 17 of Chapter II of the Establishment Code.

(c) A writ of mandamus directing anyone or more of the Respondents to give

the Petitioner the appropriate Seniority on her entry point to the Public

Service in terms of Section 14.4 of Chapter II of the Establishment Code

and/or in terms of any other provisions of Establishment Code relevant

thereto.

(d) A writ of mandamus directing anyone or more of the Respondents to

backdate the Petitioner's appointment to the public service in order to

avoid any discontinuation of her government service.

The factual template surrounding the case can be narrated in a nutshell.

The Petitioner joined the Army as a preliminary grade medical officer on 6th

February 2007 and she had been commissioned to the rank of captain. Upon

completion of 2 years of service in the preliminary grade on 6th February 2009 she

secured her promotion as a grade II medical officer in the Army and thereafter

successfully completed her efficiency bar examination as well for the preliminary

grade medical and dental officer at the government service.

After having served in the Army for more than 6 years as a Doctor, the Petitioner

retired from service on 31st May 2012. Thereafter her request to join the Ministry

of Health as a Doctor was granted when she was appointed to the Ministry of

Health in the Preliminary Grade.

Even before the Petitioner made a request of the Health Ministry to appoint her to

the Public Service she had repeatedly made a request that she be recruited to

grade II. As could be apparent from the foregoing this request had not been

granted and she was appointed only at the preliminary grade. It is apparent from

the Petitioner's pleadings that she had made a plea to be placed at grade II even

after having been recruited as a Doctor in the Health Ministry when she wrote a

letter dated 1 i h April 2013.

It could be seen that the genesis of this application for several mandates in the

nature of writs of mandamus is the failure to accommodate the request of the

Petitioner to be placed at grade II which certainly would bring her by virtue of

provisions of the Establishment Code entitlements to a higher salary and

incremental advantages.

It is indeed a salient feature of this application that the Petitioner does not seek the

invalidation or quashing of any order made by any of the Respondents. Instead the

respective pleas for several mandates against the Respondents inclusive of the

members of Public Service Commission (the 1st to 9th Respondents of the PSC) is

predicated on the basis that anyone or more of the Respondents owes the

Petitioner a duty to accord her the several reliefs that the Petitioner seeks against

them.

The statement of objections that has been filed on behalf of the 1st to 10th

Respondents (Members of the PSC) along with the corresponding affidavit of the

Secretary to PSC (10th Respondent), whilst denying that the Petitioner is entitled to

any of the writs sought, raises the preliminary objection that this court is denuded

of jurisdiction to grant any of the reliefs prayed for in view of Article 61 (A) of the

Constitution ..

The statement of objections also appends a decision made by the PSC dated 1st

August 2012 (R3) conveying the determination that the Petitioner could not be

appointed to any grade on a new appointment other than the preliminary grade.

It has to be observed that it is only consequent to this letter (P3) received by the

Secretary of the Health Ministry from the Public Service Commission that the

5

I i I!

~ f ! !li

I

\

Petitioner had been appointed in October 2012 as a Doctor at a preliminary grade

to Public Service.

It is through this document R3 that this court is apprised that the Public Service

Commission had considered the legal position with regard to the request of the

Petitioner to be placed at grade II and accordingly informed the Secretary to the

Health Ministry that the request of the Petitioner could not be granted. The

document marked as R3 is addressed from one R.H.T.S. Hettiarachchi, Assistant

Secretary of the Public Service Commission to the Secretary, Ministry of Health

notifying the following positions:-

1) There is no possibility in medical service to place the petitioner at any other

grade on a new appointment other than the preliminary grade.

2) The seniority of medical officers should be determined as provided for in

Chapter XI of the Establishment Code, the PSC rules and Section 6 of the

Service Minute of the Sri Lanka Medical Service.

One could observe that the PSC opined that the Petitioner was not securing a re-

employment in the Public Service but rather was getting appointed for the 1st time.

It was after having taken the view that the Petitioners appointment as a Doctor in

the Ministry of Health was a new appointment which entailed a placement on the

preliminary grade that the PSC had approved the appointment of the Petitioner as

a Preliminary Grade Medical Officer. The above position (R3) that the PSC took in

regard to the Petitioner was in response to a letter (R2) written by the Acting

Secretary of the Ministry of Health Mr. Mahipala to the Secretary, Public Service

Commission seeking clarifications as to what grade the Petitioner could be

appointed as she had retired from Sri Lanka Army from 31st May 2012.

6 I!

I

It is apparent from this document (R3) and the affidavit filed by the Secretary to the

Public Service Commission that it is only upon the receipt of R3 that the Health

Ministry took the decision to place the Petitioner on the preliminary grade. In other

words the Health Ministry took the decision to place the Petitioner on a preliminary

grade only after getting the decision of the Public Service Commission.

The preliminary objections raised by the Respondents have been elaborated upon

in the written submissions filed by the Respondents and the Petitioner has

countered the preliminary objections in her written submissions.

The rival positions of both the Petitioner and the Respondents can be set down as

follows:-

The preliminary objections are twofold and the Court observes that in the course of

the argument the Court itself raised the issue of whether there had been a demand

and refusal which now form the 2nd preliminary objection. For reasons set out later

in this judgment this Court does not deem it necessary to go into the merit of the

2nd objection.

The twin objections raised on behalf of the 1st to 10th Respondents are as follows:-

1. In terms of 61A of the Constitution the constitutional ouster would denude

this court of jurisdiction to hear and determine this application.

2. There doesn't appear to be a demand and refusal for the exercise of

jurisdiction to issue the several writs of mandamus that have been sought.

The Petitioner has countered these objections and state that this is not a situation

where the ouster clause in Article 61A of the Constitution apples. Rather the

Petitioner merely seeks mandates in the nature of mandamus and mandamus is

7

\

\ !

f r l ; ,

\

}r !

\ I ! l

not caught up within the ambit of Article 61A of the Constitution. In fact the

position of the Petitioner is that in the past this Court has issued mandamus against

the Psc. In any event the Petitioner was unaware of the PSC decision (R3) and came

to know of it only when the statement of objections were filed.

As this judgment has recited at the beginning the Petitioner is seeking several writs

of mandamus against the 1st to 9th Respondents who are all members of the PSC

and the 10th Respondent who is the Secretary to the Public Service Commission.

The 11th and 1ih Respondents who belong to the Ministry of Health are both public

officers. The existence of R3 - the decision of the Public Service Commission which

caused the Petitioner to be placed on the preliminary grade because the Petitioner

was joining the public service for the first time, has not been challenged before us

by way of a writ of certiorari. Given the Petitioner's assertion that she was unaware

of the existence of R3 (the PSC decision) it is explicable why there is no prayer for a

writ of certiorari to quash R3.

The decision of the PSC (R3) demonstrates that the request of the Petitioner made

to the Ministry of Health has been considered by the PSC and they have performed

the duty of expressing an opinion and taken a decision on a vital request made by

the Petitioner.

If this is an invalid exercise of discretionary power, it remains liable to be quashed

by certiorari within the parameters of law if it is so possible for such an invalidation.

So long as R3 the decision of the PSC remains in esse, let me hasten to observe that

it would be futile to issue mandamus to the Respondents who have performed a

duty rightly or otherwise. As the rule of thumb goes, certiorari has remained an

8

indispensable adjunct to the remedy of mandamus. As Lord Denning stated in

Baldwin and Francis Ltd v Patents Appeal Tribun ar -

liThe cases on mandamus are clear enough; and if mandamus will go to a

tribunal for such a cause~ then it must follow that certiorari will go also;

for when a mandamus is issued to the tribuna/~ it must hear and

determine the case afresh~ and it cannot well do this if its previous order

is still standing. The previous order must either be quashed on certiorari

or ignored; and it is better for it to be quashed."

Although both certiorari and mandamus are discretionary remedies, the court's

discretion are limited by the basic rules of judicial control and the sources of

administrative law in this country include not only English common law modified by

statutes of Sri Lanka but also the Sri Lankan constitution which circumscribes the

grant of mandates in the nature of writs butsubject to the provisions of the

Constitution-vide Article 140 of the Constitution. The question before this Court is

whether the decision of the PSC could be quashed at all on certiorari having regard

to the rules of judicial review that prevail in the country. Could this Court declare

R3 - a decision made by the PSC null and void though its existence cannot be

ignored by anyone else least of all by this Court? I pose this question because it is

the answer to this question that determines the question whether mandamus as

sought by the petitioner would be available against the psc. Though the learned

counsel for the petitioner quite forcefully argued that mandamus could go against

the PSC on its own, I take the view for reasons adumbrated below that when PSC

has already acted, neither certiorari nor mandamus would lie against the Psc.

1 (1959) AC at 693 at 693-4 9

Notwithstanding the fact that there is no prayer for the invalidation of the decision

of the PSC (R3), can this Court yet proceed to issue a mandamus against the PSC

which has the effect of compelling the PSC to reconsider their decision (R3) and

revisiting the matter afresh as the upshot of the persuasive contention of the

learned Counsel for the Petitioner eventuates in such an effect? Can this Court

issue a mandamus against the PSC though the fact stares quite stubbornly in the

face that the PSC has already acted or performed a duty through R3? This is the

first argument that this Court is confronted with.

Mandamus in the absence of certiorari-Certiorarified Mandamus

There is another argument that emerges from the contention of the learned

Counsel for the petitioner. The first argument is, as the Counsel for the petitioner

argued, that mandamus would independently lie against the PSC as mandamus is

not prohibited by Article 61A of the Constitution. The 2nd argument is, what the

Court sees as an alternative relief to certiorari where it has not been sought-namely

whether in such a situation where certiorari has not been sought, this Court could

grant against the PSC what has since come to be known in several jurisdictions as

certiorari/ied mandamus - a hybrid remedy. Both remedies, mandamus proper as

contended for by the learned counsel for the petitioner regardless of Article 61A of

the Constitution and certiorari/ied mandamus~ as I would presently show, would

both be unavailable against the PSC when the PSC has acted as in this case. Let me

hasten to point out the distinction between the two. Whilst a writ of mandamus

proper would compel the statutory functionary to perform a statutory duty owed,

a certiorari/ied mandamus would also quash an invalid exercise of power in such a

way as certiorari would do.

10

\ 1

\ ! f I

I

The first argument namely a mandamus would lie as it is not barred by Article 61A

of the Constitution becomes incapable of acceptance having regard to the

inescapable antecedent fact namely PSC has already acted by embodying its

decision in R3 and there is nothing further to compel the PSC by way of a duty. Thus

the futility of issuing a mandamus when the PSC has already taken a decision

should be dispositive of the case but on the 2nd argument of mandamus issuing

against the PSC in the absence of certiorari ( certiorarified mandamus) a few

words have to be expressed.

I must observe that the question of issuing a certiorarijied mandamus was not

raised by the Petitioner but the Court deems it appropriate to discuss this relief as

it has become a universal phenomenon in administrative justice. In fact mandamus

has done the work of certiorari in many a jurisdiction and many moons ago our

courts have been cognizant of this remedy in the past rather than being dismissive

of it.2 When mandamus is issued to quash an invalid exercise of power whilst the

same writ at the same time commands the statutory functionary to retake the

decision in accordance with law, it has been classified as certiorari/ied mandamus.

The question before this Court is whether this Court can grant such a certiorari/ied

mandamus on the facts and circumstances of this case.

Certiorari/ied Mandamus

No doubt as H.W.R. Wade and C.E. Forsyth point out at page 529 of their tome

Administrative Law (10th Edition), a mandatory order such as a mandamus cannot

be used by itself in an elliptical way so as to do the work of a quashing order

though this has become the habitual practice in liquor licensing cases. In the United

States too, many a State court has allowed mandamus to be used in place of

}

certiorari-a remedy which became known as "certiorarified mandamus"-see a

useful article by Professor Jaffe of Harvard in (1956) Public Law, 230. An insightful

analysis by Ralph N. Kleps on the developments of certiorari/ied mandamus in the

Californian jurisdiction is described in a series of two articles which were carried in

two issues of Stanford Law Review3 India and Pakistan have embraced

certiorarified mandamus in all earnest and invariably the petitions in those

jurisdictions for certiorari/ied mandamus always contain a prayer for summoning

the record of the statutory functionarl. As I stated above certiorarified mandamus

has not been foreign terrain for Sri Lanka as Dr. Sunil Coorey in his monumental

work on administrative laws cites the case of Rasammah v Manamperl where

Vythialingam J cited and adopted the words of S.A.De Smith in Judicial Review of

Administrative Action, 1st ed., p 434 which were as follows-

"Nor in general will it (mandamus) lie for the purpose of undoing that

which has already been done in contravention of statute."

The provenance of this passage is traceable to an old precedent of Ex parte Nash7

where Lord Campbell, c.J, in refusing to grant a mandamus commanding a railway

company to remove its seal from the register of share holders on the ground that it

has been irregularly affixed stated;

liThe writ of Mandamus is most beneficial; but we must keep its operation

within legal bounds and not grant it at the fancy of all mankind. We grant it

when that has not been done which a statute orders to be done; but not for

the purpose of undoing what has been done. We may upon an application

for a mandamus entertain the question whether a corporation not having

affixed its seal, be bound to do so; but not the question whether, when they

have affixed it, they have been right in doing so. I cannot give countenance

to the practice of trying in this form questions whether an act professedly

done in pursuance of a statute was really justified by the statute./I

Much water has flowed down under the bridge since these words were echoed in

the 19th century and with the expanding canvas of administrative law the aforesaid

limitation on the scope of mandamus has ceased to exist. These developments are

commented upon in several editions of Dr. Stanley de Smith's treatise Judicial

Review of Administrative Action. In the Fifth Edition which was restructured quite

magnificently by the Rt. Hon The Lord Woolf and Jeffrey Jowell, Q.C the vanishing

of the old trails of mandamus is captured in the following passage.8

"Many of the narrow technicalities which once applied to the grant of

mandamus, for example, that it would not lie for the purpose of undoing

that which has already been done in contravention of statute no longer

restrict the remedy."

Again one finds a perceptive passage which goes as follows-

"In some situations, however, mandamus has been granted to undo what has

been done; the courts merely treat the unlawful act as a nullity and order the

competent authority to per/orm its duty as if it had refused to act at all in the

first place. ,J9

This gladsome development has to be welcome and it has to be said that

certiorari/ied mandamus would be available in Sri Lanka to quash an invalid

exercise of power: But will it lie against the PSC having regard to the fact that it has

already made a decision that is protected by Article 61A of the Constitution. Can

this Court simply ignore R3 and go on to command the PSC to retake a decision

despite Article 61A of the Constitution?

The question arises whether mandamus proper can issue or in the alternative a

certiorari/ied mandamus is available to quash a PSC decision and compel the PSC to

consider the matter afresh, in the light of the fact that certiorari itself is

unavailable to quash the decision of the PSC?

If PSC has acted and made a decision, the decision of the PSC is protected by a

privative clause such as Article 61A of the Constitution because Article 140 of the

Constitution mandates this Court to defer to a constitutional ouster. In fact if I may

recapitulate the rival contentions, the learned Deputy Solicitor General cited Article

61A in bar of this application since the decision of the PSC R3 is in esse, whilst the

learned counsel for the petitioner contended that he was not seeking an

invalidation of R3 but a mandamus that will compel the PSC to take a decision

according to law and in any event Article 61A does not preclude the grant of

mandamus against the Psc. It is in this light that I have posed the question-when

certiorari itself is unavailable against the PSC and an appellate procedure has been

. established by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act No. 4 of 2002 against

decisions of the PSC, subject to the fundamental rights jurisdiction of the Supreme

Court, would mandamus become available when the PSC has already acted?

At this stage it is not irrelevant to indulge in a discussion of the ouster clauses that

impinge on the resolution of the issue before us.

Article 55(5) Article and 61A of the Constitution

It is the 17th Amendment to the Constitution that brought in the privative clause

Article 61A replacing the previous ouster found in Article 55(5) of the 1978

Constitution.

As the learned Deputy Solicitor General has submitted, in applying the provisions

of Article 61A, Court must be mindful of the state of law, as reflected in the

decisions of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, prior to the lih

Amendment since "the legislative language will be interpreted on the assumption

that the Legislature was aware of existing statutes, the rules of statutory

construction, and the judicial decisions and that if a change occurs in legislative

language a change was intended in the legislative result." [Bindra; Interpretation of

Statutes; 8th Ed; p. 206].

Section 55(5) of the 1978 Constitution came up for interpretation in Abeywickrema

v Pathirana11 where the majority (Sharvananda CJ, Ranasinghe J, Atukorale J and

De Alwis J) held that Article 55(5) of the Constitution does not protect orders or

decisions of a public officer which are nullities or ultra vires from judicial review.

Notwithstanding the challenge that could be mounted against the decision of a

public officer if he had no authority to make such decision or he acted ultra vires,

Sharvananda CJ however observed at page 155 of the majority opinion that despite

the fact that the ultra vires decision of the public officer could be set aside, it would

enjoy inviolability in the following circumstances-

/I But if the particular officer had no legal authority under Section 58 to make

that order Article 55(5) does not bar a challenge of that order, but if the

11 (1986) 1 SrLLR 120

15

order/decision of the public officer, acting ultra vires has been adopted by the

"Cabinet of Ministers", a Minister, Public Service Commission, Committee of

the Public Service Commission or of a public officer to whom the Public Service

Commission has made the necessary delegation under Article 58(1), then of

course, such decision or order becomes the order of that constitutional

functionary, and certainly its validity cannot be inquired into."

Commenting on the pith and substance of Article 55(5) of the Constitution,

Wanasundera J made the following observations in his dissenting opinion at page

182-

"Every person acquainted with the post-independence period of our history,

especially the constitutional and legal issues that cropped up during that

period, would know how the actions of the Government and the Public Service

Commission dealing with practically every aspect of their control over public

officers were challenged and taken to the courts. A stage came when the

Government found itself practically hamstrung by injunctions and court orders

and not given a free hand to run the public service and thereby the

administration as efficiently as it would wish. The 1972 reforms came

undoubtedly as a reaction to this. The thinking behind the framers of the

Constitution was that the public service must be made the exclusive domain of

the Executive without interference from the courts. Vide section 106.

The present Constitution has only given refinement to that thinking. The

present Article 55 (5), which is in effect a preclusive clause of the greatest

coverage, appears to shut the courts out from this domain except for a

violation of a fundamental right."

16

Wanasundera J's observations on the ambit of Article 55(5) are to this effect at

page 186-

"Even a cursory look at Article 55(5) shows that it goes well beyond the usual

kind of preclusive clause. Article 55(5) states that no court or tribunal shall

have power or jurisdiction over any order or decision of the Cabinet of

Ministers, the Public Service Commission, a Committee of the Public Service

commission, or of a public officer in regard to any matter concerning the

appointment, transfer, dismissal or disciplinary control of a public officer. It

goes on to state specifically that a court or tribunal cannot "inquire into,

pronounce upon, or in any manner call in question any such order or decision."

Article 55 (5) of the Constitution was also gone into in Bandara and Another v.

Premachandra, Secretary of Ministry of Lands, Irrigation and Mahaweli

Development and Othersllat p 312 where Mark Fernando J commented on the

"pleasure principle" contained in Article 55(5).

So the upshot of reasoning of Courts in regard to Article 55 (5) could be

summarized as follows:-

(a) If the impugned order/decision was made by a public officer who did have

legal authority to so order/decide, the preclusive clause in Article 55(5)

applied and the jurisdiction of the court was ousted.

(b) If the impugned order/decision was made by a public officer who did not

have legal authority to so order/decide, then the preclusive clause in Article

55(5) did not apply.

(c) But if the order/decision of the public officer, acting ultra vires has been

adopted by a body/person to whom the Public Service Commission has made

the necessary delegation, then such decision/order becomes the order of

that constitutional functionary, and Article 55(5) prevents its validity being

inquired into.

Article 61A of the Constitution goes as follows:-

"Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of Article 126,

no court or tribunal shall have power or jurisdiction to inquire into, or

pronounce upon or in any manner call in question any order or decision made

by the Commission, a Committee, or any public officer, in pursuance of any

power of duty conferred or imposed on such Commission, or delegated to a

Committee or public officer, under this Chapter or under any other law."

Unlike previously the appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and

dismissal of public officers were vested with the Public Service Commission and

notthe Cabinet of Ministers [Article 55(1)]. The members of the PSC are appointed

by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council [Article

54(1)]. The PSC can delegate to a Committee or a public officer its power of

appointment, promotion, transfer, disciplinary control and dismissal of specified

categories of public officers [Article 56(1) and 57(1)]. Any public officer aggrieved

by an order made by any such Committee or public officer may appeal to the PSC

[Article 58(1)]. A further appeal against any order or decision made by the PSC is

provided for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which is appointed by the Judicial

Service Commission [Article 59]. This is in addition to the jurisdiction created by

Article 126 of the Constitution which is retained in terms of Article 61A.

18

\ !

In Ratnasiri and Others v. Ellawala and Otherr2the Court of Appeal declared that

the decision or determination made by the 4th respondent Secretary, being the

decision or determination of a public officer exercising authority delegated by the

PSC is precluded from judicial review by Article 61A. It has to be commented that

this case discussed the ambit of Article 61A in extenso.

Thus it is quite clear that R3 - the existing order of the PSC is an impediment to

secure a mandamus as R3 is clothed with an ouster of jurisdiction in terms of

Article 63A of the Constitution. Even if the petitioner was unaware of R3 at the

time he filed this application, the issue of mandamus would carry the implication

from this Court that the PSC has made an error in the first instance-a task which

this Court is constitutionally incompetent to engage in as result of Article 61A of the

Constitution.

The exercise of writ jurisdiction in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution is

subject to the provisions of the Constitution in that Article 61A of the Constitution

would preclude judicial review of decisions of the PSC. When the jurisdiction of this

Court to judicially review PSC decisions by certiorari is shut out at a threshold stage,

a revisit of that decision in the guise of a mandamus or certiorari/ied mandamus

will be beyond the pale of our jurisdiction and on that score we are inclined to hold

with the submissions of the learned Deputy Solicitor General that mandamus will

not lie in the instant case before us.

retake the decision would also not be available as the grant of that remedy too

would call in question the propriety of R3 which enjoys immunity.

Demand and Refusal

In the view we have taken of this matter, we do not think that we do have to go

into the further question whether the preconditions for the issue of mandamus

namely demand of the PSC and refusal have been satisfied.

Thus we would summarize our conclusions in a nutshell.

Conclusions

1. Since the PSC has already acted in the matter it would be futile to mandate

them by a mandamus to act in a particular way in the absence of certiorari that

would have the effect of quashing the decision they have already made.

2. Though it is unfortunate that the Petitioner was not aware of the existence of

R3, the decision of the PSC which the Petitioner possibly came to know only

after statement of objection was filed demonstrates that the PSC has already

performed a duty.

3. Article 61A of the Constitution which falls within the phrase ((subject to the

provisions of the Constitution" in Article 140 of the Constitution would operate

as a constitutional ouster to shut out the jurisdiction of this Court to judicially

review decisions of the Psc.

4. Though certiorarijied mandamus has been available in the UK in a limited class

of cases as well as in many state Courts of the United States, India and Pakistan

and Sri Lanka too has been cognizant of this development, the constitutional

ouster as contained in Article 61A of the Constitution would prohibit the issue of

a certiorari/ied mandamus as the PSC has already acted. We should develop this

remedy provided proper pleadings are in place but on the facts and

circumstances of this case when the functionary has acted and the decision is

protected by a constitutional ouster, Article 140 of the Constitution would be a

bar to an issue of mandamus or certiorari/ied mandamus. In both instances an

impingement of the decision of the PSC would take place directly or indirectly.

5. The issue of a mandamus against the PSC would convey the implication that the

decision of the PSC is invalid or ultra vires and such an implication cannot be

created even indirectly as Article 61A of the Constitution prohibits the

impugnment of PSC decisions in writ proceedings.

In light of the above, we uphold the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the

Respondents and dismiss this application.
