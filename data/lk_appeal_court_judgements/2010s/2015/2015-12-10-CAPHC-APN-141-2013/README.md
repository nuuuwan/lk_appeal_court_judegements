The Counsel for the Appellal~t has advelied Couli to the

has not considered the t~lCt, who was 111 actual possessIon

of , the premIses as ai. 14.09.20 II when the information. was

filed 111 Court. Further it IS apparent from the statement

made by the Respondent, that Casim Mohideen was 111 possessIon,

police made by the Respondent admitting that one Cassim

Mohideen had been payll1g rent as the tenant to" the

Mosque.

In the above setting it IS ostensible that at the time the

information was tiled III terms of Section 66 (I) of the Primary

Court procedure Act, the Petitioner - Appellant has been 111

possession of the disputed premises.

It IS viewed further that the Learned High COU11 JuoQe In

her impugned order has stated the fact that no exceptional

circumstances averred, for the High Court to exercise Revisionary

powers of the High Coul1.

But it IS trite that if the Magistrate has made an order

which IS ex-facie wrong, would be quashed by way of

Revision even though no appeal may lie against such an

order. It was thus observed III the case of Mallika De

"Where the order of Court IS ex-lucie wrong it would be

quashed by way of reVISion though no appeal may lie

In the instant nntter it IS to be noted, a Magistrate acting

111 terms of Section 66 (I) of the Primary Court Act, IS not

entitled to decide on the legal rights of the pal1ies to the

dispute unless the situation calls for such determination.

It IS abundantly clear that the Appellant was renovating the

said premises. when the Respondent came and demanded the

vacant possession of the said premises, and the Learned

Magistrate was duty bound to decide who was 111 possession

of the said premises at the time when the police filed the

information repOli 111 the Magistrate COUl1.

the Learned Magistrate was compelled to decide was whether

the time the information was filed 111 terms of Section 66 ( I )

In encapsulating the above facts, the Respondent's statement to

the police gives a clear picture of the dispute relevant to this

case. According to his statement he was to obtain the key
