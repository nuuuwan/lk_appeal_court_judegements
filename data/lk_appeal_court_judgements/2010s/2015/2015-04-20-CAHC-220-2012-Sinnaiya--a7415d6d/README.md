Accused-appellant is present in Court produced by the Prison

Authorities.

Matter is taken up for argument. Counsel for the accused-

appellant submits that in this case two accused were indicted for the

murder of one Karuppan Sathyasee1an. At the trial out of the two

accused, the 1 st accused Murugiah Balachandran was absent and the

trial proceeded in absentia. The 2nd accused Sinniah Ganeshan was

present at the trial and both accused were convicted by the learned

High Court Judge for the murder of Karuppan Sathyasee1an. But the

accused who was absconding had not appealed against the said

conviction. This appeal is only on the conviction and sentence on

1

Sinniah Ganeshan who is the 2nd accused. According to the evidence

an incident had taken place on 25.07.1996 in the evening when the two

accused met the deceased on the road. Counsel submits that even

though the deceased had an argument with the 2nd accused on the

previous day, meeting on this fateful day is a chance meeting. Only eye

witness for this case is one Rajagopal who is said to be the nephew of

the deceased. Counsel for the accused-appellant submits that there

are serious contradictions inter se with regard to the weapons used by

the two accused in the evidence of Rajagopal. He further submits that

the deceased's dying deposition contradicts with the version of

Raj ago pal. When leaving all these aside he submits that his main

submission before this Court is with regard to the failure by the trial

Judge to consider the culpability of the accused. Learned trial Judge

had failed to consider whether there was a sudden fight or any other

circumstances under which the offence committed. However, the

learned Deputy Solicitor General appearing for the Attorney General

concedes the above position and submits that the failure by the learned

trial Judge to consider the accused's culpability is very important when

considering the final outcome in this matter. Learned Deputy Solicitor

General has no objection for this Court convicting the accused-

appellant for culpable homicide not amounting to murder based on a

sudden fight. When considering the evidence of this case this Court

agrees with the submissions made by both Counsel. We observe

that this is a chance meeting and therefore we decide to set aside the

conviction on the 2nd accused by the learned trial Judge for murder and

2

l .

replace the conviction with one under culpable homicide not amounting

to murder based on sudden fight under Section 297 of the Penal Code.

We impose a jail term of 12 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of

Rs.5000j - on the accused-appellant. In default of the payment of fine

we impose further period of 2 years simple imprisonment. Sentences

will operate from today. The appeal is partly allowed.

Registrar is directed to communicate this order to the High

Court of Kandy and return the brief to the High Court of Kandy in order

to inform the accused-appellant the new sentence and issue a fresh

committal on the accused-appellant, accordingly.
