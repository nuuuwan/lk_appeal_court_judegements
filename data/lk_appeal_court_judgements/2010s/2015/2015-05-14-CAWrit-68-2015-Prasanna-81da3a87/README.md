the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the 151 Respondent to act according to law in

appointing the Chief Minister of the Western Provincial Council;

f) Grant interim order restraining the 151 Respondent from removing the Petitioner from the

post of Chief Minister of the Western Provincial Council until the final determination of this

application;

g) Grant interim order restraining the 151 Respondent from appointing the 5ih Respondent

and/ or any other person other than the Petitioner as the Chief Minister of the Western

Provincial Council until the final determination of this application;

When the matter was taken up before us for support, respondents appearing through their counsel

raised several preliminary objections challenging the maintainability of this application.

However at that stage the Court decided to take up both matters, i.e. preliminary objections on the

maintainability of the application and whether the petitioner is entitled under Law to ask for notices

and interim relief as prayed by him in the petition, together.

Petitioner contested the Western Provincial Council from the United Peoples Freedom Alliance

(UPFA) in the Provincial Councils Election 2014 and was elected as a member representing UPFA

obtaining 250,000 preferential votes which is the highest number of preferential votes obtained by a

candidate in the Gampaha District.

The Western Provincial Council consists of 104 members out of whom 56 members were elected

from UPF A and 48 members from other political parties. Appointment of Chief Minister to a

Provincial council is vested with the Provincial Governor under Article 154 F (4) of the constitution

which provides as follows;

Art.154 F (4)

The Governor shall appoint as Chief Minister, the member of the Provincial Council

constituted for that Province, who in his opinion, is best able to command the support of a

majority of the members of that Council:

Provided that where more than one half of the members elected to a Provincial Council are

members of one political party, the Governor shall appoint the leader of that Political Party in

the Council as the Chief Minister.

According to the Petitioner, he was the Leader of the UPFA group of the Western Provincial Council

and by Government Gazette No. 1859/66 dated 25th April 2014 (P-5) previous Governor of the

Western Provincial Council announced the appointment of the petitioner as the Chief Minister of the

Western Provincial Council.

Since then petitioner was functioning as the Chief Minister Western Province and continued to be the

Leader of the UPFA Group of the Western Provincial Council which is confirmed by document P-4.

Petitioner submits that, after the conclusion of the Presidential Elections held on 08.01.2015 the 5ih

Respondent who is the Opposition Leader of the Western Provincial Council has taken steps to obtain

affidavits from other members of the Western Provincial Council purporting to grant their support to

the 57th Respondent and thereafter to have himself appointed by the former Governor of the Western

Provincial Council as Chief Minister on the basis that the 57th Respondent commands the support of

a majority of the members of the Western Provincial Council.

Petitioner has produced marked P-8 a news item published in Lakbima News Paper on 15.01.2015 in

support of the above position. However according to the petitioner, the then Governor Western

Province has resigned and the 1st Respondent was appointed the Governor Western Province on

21.01.2015.

Petitioner has failed to submit before this court any step taken by the 1st Respondent and lor by his

predisisor in furtherance of the said request by the 5ih Respondent, instead the petitioner has

submitted, that he made inquiries and became aware that the then Governor of the Western Province

was contemplating to appoint the 57th Respondent on the basis that he commanded the support of the

majority of the members of the said council. Consequent upon the resignation of the then Governor of

the Western Province and the appointment of 1st Respondent as his successor in office, the 57th

Respondent has re-agitated this matter with the 1st Respondent and urged him to take steps to remove

the petitioner from the office of Chief Minister of the Western Province.

From the aforesaid it is manifestly clear that the Petitioner has relied on hearsay material to arrive at

surmises and conjectures in respect of the appointment of Chief Minister to the Western Provincial

Council.

In the present application the petitioner has prayed for the grant of a mandate III the nature of

Prohibition

a) Prohibiting the 151 Respondent from removing the Petitioner from the post of Chief

Minister of the Western Provincial Council and

b) Prohibiting the 151 Respondent from appointing the 5ih Respondent and lor any other

person other than the petitioner as the Chief Minister of the Western Provincial Council

As discussed by HWR Wade and C F Forsyth in administrative Law ( 10Ih Edition at page 512)

"quashing and prohibiting orders frequently go hand in hand, as where a quashing order is sought to

quash the decision and a prohibiting order to restrained its execution. But either remedy may be

sought by itself. Where only a prohibiting order for to prevent the enforcement of an ultra vires

decision, as happened in the last cited case, the effect is the same as if a quashing order had been

granted to quash it; for the court necessarily declares its invalidity before prohibiting its enforcement.

A prohibiting order is a remedy strictly concerned with excess of jurisdiction.

In the present case petitioner has failed to establish any step taken by the 151 Respondent and lor by

his predecessor in excess of Jurisdiction and lor failed to satisfy this court that the 151 Respondent is

contemplating to remove the petitioner or appoint any other person in his place.

The 151 Respondent by motion dated 61h April 2015 has tendered before this court a letter issued by

the secretary to the Western Provincial Council dated 19.02.2015 confirming that no request had been

made by any party to the 151 Respondent or his predecessor to remove the Chief Minister. The above

document clearly indicated that no decision has been made by the 151 Respondent andlor to appoint

the 5ih Respondent or any other person in his place and therefore it is clear that the petitioner's case

is based purely on speculation and irrelevant hear say material.

Therefore this court is of the view that the petitioner has failed to place before court sufficient

material, supporting the relief sought in the prayer to the petition. The Petitioners application is

dismissed. No cost is ordered.
