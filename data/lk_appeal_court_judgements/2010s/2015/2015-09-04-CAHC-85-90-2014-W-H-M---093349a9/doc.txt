Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J (P / CAl.

At this stage the parties brings to the notice of this court that according

to the case record and the journal entries, there is no indication that the

accused had been given jury option under section 195 (e) (e) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No: 15 of 1979. This court as well as the Supreme

Court in several instances had repeatedly decided that non granting the jury

option to the accused is not a mere irregularity but is an illegality that vitiate

2

all proceedings. Therefore we set aside the conviction and sentence imposed

by the High Court Nuwara-Eliya and order a re-trial. Learned High Court

Judge is further directed to conclude this matter expeditiously since the offence

pertaining to this indictment has been committed in the year 1994.

H.C.J. Madawala, J. I agree.
