This is an application for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

certiorari to quash a quit notice issued by the Respondent under State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act No. 07 of 1979 (as amended). (Hereinafter

referred to as the Act) The 1 st Petitioner is a company duly registered under

the Companies Act and the 2nd Respondent is the Chairmen and the

Managing Director of the said company. The Petitioners say that the 1 st

Petitioner became the owner of the property described in the petition by

deed of transfer marked P3. The Petitioners further aver that their

predecessors in title became the owners of the land since 1947. The plan is

marked and produced as P4. They further aver that the 1 st Petitioner was

paying rates to the Pradeshiya Sabha.

The Petitioners' contention is that there is no reason for the

Respondent to form an opinion that the land is a state land. Therefore, the

quit notice issued under the Act has been issued without jurisdiction.

Petitioners further aver, among other thing, that the predecessors in

title owned this land for more than 33 Ih years and acquired prescriptive

title to the land.

The Respondent's position is that the quit notice was issued under

the Act, to evict the Petitioner, from a state land, where he was in

unauthorized occupation. In proof, he has tendered the tracing and the

tenement list prepared on behalf of the Surveyor General marked R 3 which

shows that the land depicted in the quit notice is a state land.

The Petitioners in paragraph 16 of the petition states why the quit

notice is illegal, null and void and of no force or avail in law and is liable

to be quashed. In sub paragraph 'c' they say that the land depicted in the

Writ C A 236/2012

3

quit notice had been owned by the Petitioners' predecessors in title for over

33 1/3 years and that they have acquired prescriptive title to the land.

There is no evidence to show that the land depicted in the quit notice

is the same land that is claimed by the Petitioners as a private land which

is shown in the plan marked P4. The Surveyor General's tracing is not

superimposed on P4. The boundaries defer. Therefore, without having

proper and admissible evidence, the Petitioners cannot be heard to say it is

the same land.

The ownership alone will not give any prescriptive title to a land. He

has to be in possession too. Sub paragraph 'c' does not speak anything on

posseSSIOn.

The possession has to be proved by parol evidence if there is no

conclusive documentary proof. It has been held in C.R. Panadura 14635.

Gren (1873) C.R.1 (Hussain case law vol. 19 page 492) that, "in absence

of conclusive documentary proof, a title to a land claimed by Crown cannot

be established by a private party without parol evidence of possession and

occupation. " As I have pointed earlier, there is no conclusive documentary

proof on identity of the land had been tendered by the Petitioners.

Under these circumstances, the Petitioners' claim that the land

depicted in the quit notice is a private land or that they have acquired the

prescriptive title to the land is a disputed fact which has to be established

in competent Civil Court. In the case of Writ C.A. 1299/87 CA minutes

11.06.95, S.N. Silva 1. (P.CA) (as he was then) held that" ...... any dispute

as to the title should be resolved in an action that may be filed as provided

in section 12 of the Act. "

The Petitioners' main argument is that there is no reason for the

Respondent to form an opinion that it is a state land. The plan marked R3

is prepared on behalf of the Surveyor General by his officers and signed by

his officers. Section 21 of the Surveys Act No.17 of 2002 provides that a

plan prepared and signed by Surveyor General or his officers on his behalf

to be taken to be prima facie proof of the facts stated therein. The section

reads thus;

21.Any cadastral map, plan or any other plan or map prepared in

accordance with the provisions of this act or any written law

purported to be signed by the surveyor general or officer acting on

his behalf and offered in evidence in any suit shall be received in

evidence and shall be taken to be prima facie proof of the facts stated

there in and shall not be necessary to prove that it was infact signed

by the surveyor General or an officer acting on his behalf, nor that

it was made by his authority, nor that the same is accurate until the

evidence to the contrary shall have first been given.

The plan marked R3 was prepared on behalf of Surveyor General

and signed by its officers. The plan shows that the land depicted in the quit

notice is a state land and the Petitioners are in unauthorized occupation.

The Respondent has adequately identified that the land depicted in the quit

notice as a state land. Therefore, the Petitioners' contention that the

Respondent has no reason to form the opinion that the land depicted in the

quit notice is a state land: is not tenable.

A specific remedy in a specific forum is provided under section 12

of the Act for those who claim that the land is private land owned by him.

He can vindicate his rights in the District Court.

In the case of Farook v. Gunawardane Govt. Agent Ampara [1980]

2 Sri L R 243 at 247 Abdul Carder J. held that "1 am of the opinion that

the Act expressly precludes the need for a inquiry by the competent

Writ C A 236/2012

5

authority before he forms the opinion that any land is state land. " In the

case of 1399/12 (supra) held that "If a person is not entitle to a hearing

before the competent authority ipso facto he would not be entitled a

hearing before a Court exercising writ jurisdiction. A remedy has to be

sought by the aggrieved party, within the scheme of the Act. "

Under these circumstances, the application is dismissed.
