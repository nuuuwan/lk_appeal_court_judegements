Argued and

Decided on 23.07.2015.

Vijith K.Malalgoda PC,J. (PICA)

Heard counsel for the Petitioner m support of this

application and also the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

9th Respondent and counsel for the 1 Oth Respondent.

This matter is being supported today for notices as well as

for interim relief. This refers to a disputed land which was

originally granted by a permit to the Petitioner's mother. On her

death, the permit has now been issued to the Petitioner. However

the material before us shows that there is a continuous dispute

with regard to the question of using this land as a burial ground.

At one stage the learned Magistrate had made order declaring this

as a burial ground but thereafter by a District Court order the

land has been given back to the Petitioner's mother. However

after the death of the Petitioner's mother the Respondent had

held an inquiry and decided under Section 109 of the Land

Development Ordinance to cancel the permit but this Court on a

writ application filed by the Petitioner had cancelled the said order

since the correct order should be not under Section 109 of the

Land Development Ordinance but under Section 110 of the Land

Development Ordinance. A fresh inquiry was held and in fact the

officer who conducted the inquiry has visited the land in question

and made observations with regard to this land. One allegation

against the petitioner is that he is not occupying the land.

Petitioner's position is that he is occupying the adjoining land and

he uses this land to cultivate. But in contrary the officer who

visited the land had reported that there was very little cultivation

in the said land. The Respondents have finally come to the

conclusion to cancel the said permit under Section 110 of the

Land Development Ordinance, which is the correct Section

applicable for cancellation of such permit. Since the order marked

X51 had been issued by the officer who had visited the land in

question and the 1 st Respondent who heard the appeal had

referred to the said order and was satisfied with regard to the

decision made by the 8th Respondent.

Therefore, this Court is not inclined to interfere with the

decision made by the 1 st respondent marked X55. Application by

the Petitioner is accordingly dismissed.
