The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the I st and 2nd

accused-appellants informs Court that the 1 st accused-appellant is an

Usbakistan national, was married to the 2nd accused-appellant who IS

a Sri Lankan and was living in Sri Lanka for some time. She IS

the mother of two children. The eldest being nme years at present

and the youngest is nearly five years. He submits that the eldest

child was with certain known parties of the two accused since the

both accused are in remand custody pending this appeal. Counsel

submits that whilst the eldest son was with a known party, it was

observed that the said child had behavioral problems probably due

to the factor that both parents are not with him. They have to

change hands and finally the child is now with an orphanage. The

youngest child who is below five years is permitted to be with the

mother. He submits that the prison authorities has discretion to

consider the custody of the child once the child reaches the age of

five years. The learned Counsel's submissions on behalf of the 1 st

accused-appellant is purely on sympathetic grounds. He begs mercy

of this Court and submits that being a mother she had to look

after her two children and now that she has realized the consequences

of her conduct she will not lead to the same life once she leaves

3

the pnson. Therefore he moves Court to consider a lenient

sentence to be imposed on her. According to the judgment delivered

on 28.03.2011 all three accused were convicted and they were

separately sentenced to a total period of 9 years. Out of the

charges in the indictment, 1 st count on which all three accused

were convicted the Court had imposed 5 years ngorous

imprisonment with a fine of the Rs. 50,0001=. 2nd and 5th counts

on which the 1 st accused-appellant was convicted, was imposed

two years ngorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 25,0001= with

a default term of 3 months simple imprisonment. The Court has

made order to run the above sentences consecutively.

The submissions before this Court was for the Court to

consider making the above sentences to run concurrent. He further

moves considering the circumstances under which he is making the

submissions, to consider making the said term to run from the date

of conviction. With regard to the 2nd accused who is the husband

of the 1 st accused the learned Counsel submits that the 3 rd and 6th

counts under which he was convicted other than the first count are

abetment counts and therefore move that the Court to consider

making all the said sentences to run concurrent and also to

consider back dating the sentence.

The learned Counsel appearing for the 3 rd accused submits

that his client is only the driver of the 1 st and 2nd accused and was

involved in transporting the so called victims in this case. He

associates with the submissions made by the learned Counsel for

the 1 st and 2nd accused-appellants and move that the Court to act

leniently on the 3rd accused-appellant.

Learned Senior Additional Solicitor General appearmg

for the Attorney General brings to the notice of this Court the

seriousness of this indictment which IS based on procurement and

human traffic and he submits that he IS facing the difficulty in

replying the submissions of the learned Counsel for the 1 st accused-

appellant specially for the reason that the 1 st accused-appellant on

whom the Counsel wanted this Court to act leniently is the main

perpetrator of this offence. Therefore he submits that this is very

difficult task for him to justify any reduction on the sentence

imposed on her. However considering the mitigatory circumstances

submitted by the learned Counsel, specially to the effect that she is

a mother of two children, where the eldest is presently in an

orphanage and the youngest staying with her but facing danger of

taken out from her since the child is reaching the age of five

years, the learned President's Counsel submits that he will not

object for making sentences imposed on the 1 st accused-appellant to

run concurrent. But with the question of back dating the sentence

the learned Counsel submits that he will leave that matter in the

hands of the Court. However considering the nature of this offence

where the three accused were involved in procurement of two

Usbakistan girls and making them to work as prostitutes in this

country, he submits that he will vehemently object for any

application for making the sentences to run concurrent or back dating

with regard to the 2nd and 3rd accused-appellants.

We are mindful of all these facts and considering all

the submissions made before this Court decide to impose the

following sentence on all three accused.

All three accused-appellants were imposed a sentence of

five years ngorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 50,0001= on the

1 st count. There IS no default term imposed on them, we order the

default term of SIX months simple imprisonment on count one III

addition to the 50,0001= fine already imposed on all 3 accused. In

addition to that the 1 st accused-appellant was convicted for the 2nd

and 5th charges in the indictment and imposed the sentence of two

years rigorous imprisonment with the fine of Rs. 25,0001= and

default term of three months simple imprisonment on each count.

We affirm those convictions but we make order that all three

sentences imposed on the 1 st accused-appellant to run concurrent

and therefore the period she has to serve in jail will be five years

rigorous imprisonment. With regard to the fines and the default

terms already imposed we make no changes. We make further

order to run the said jail term of 5 year with effect from the date

of conviction, i.e from 28.03.2011. The 2nd and 3rd accused-

appellants were convicted of 3rd and 6th and 4th and i h respectively

and imposed a sentence of 2 years rigorous imprisonment with a

fine of Rs. 25,0001= on each count and default term of three

months simple imprisonment. We affirm those convictions. With

appellant. Subject to the above variation in the sentences imposed

on the 1 st Accused-Appellant the appeal stand dismissed.
