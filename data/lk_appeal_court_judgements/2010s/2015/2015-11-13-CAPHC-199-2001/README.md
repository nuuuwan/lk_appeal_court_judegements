is marked as "X 14" Further it was held by the Primary

Court Judge that the 'dispute' complained by the Police IS

regarding a part of a land as contemplated In Section 75

of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, and hence the alleged

dispute should be determined IS terns of section 68 of the

said Act.

The said section IS reproduced herein below section 68 (1).

" Where the dispute relates to the posseSSIOn of any land

of part thereof it shall be the duty of the Judge of

the Primary Court holding the InqUIry to determine as

to who was IS posseSSIOn of such land or part thereof"

The Learned Judge of the Primary Court has taken

cogmsance of the Complaint made by the 15t Party - Respondents

regarding the 2nd and 3rd Party -Respondents involvement In

cutting down some trees IS his land.

The observation made by the investigating officer was also

considered by the Judge of the Primary Court In the said

impugned order.

The following facts emanate from the said observations, VIZ.

That the 2nd party Respondent has claimed the coffee

plantation. The 15t Party Respondent has produced the Deed

bearing No. 1714 and asserted the fact that he IS the owner

of the land IS dispute.

:;

Further more the 2nd Party Respondent has admitted that he cut

7 trees of Ginisapu as those trees belonged to his father.

It has been the contention of the 2nd Party - I st Respondent,

that he possessed the disputed land, from a partition decree.

The Learned Judg~ of the Primary Court has considered all

the relevant documents tendered by all parties, to buttress their

possessIOn to the land IS Issue.

The I st Party - Respondent has tendered certain documents marked x 9

to x 12 viz the receipts of the payment of acreage fees. The

Learned Judge was of the VIew, that those receipts

the period relevant to this Issue.

do not cover

It IS the categorical position of the 2nd Party - Respondent, that

the I st Party Respondent never had posseSSIOn of the same.

The Learned Judge of the Primary Court has also recognised

the case of RAMACINGAN vs THANGARAJAH, (1982) 2 SLR

699 - which was held thus;

" On the other hand if the dispute IS In regard to any

right of posseSSIOn of such land, and question for decision

according to section 69 (1) IS who IS entitled to the right

which IS the subject of the dispute. The word 'entitle' here

connotes the ownership of the

time being to exerCIse that right.

question which

party IS entitled to the disputed right preliminary to

making an order under section 69 (2) "

Nevertheless the Learned Judge of the Primary Court has

arrived at the determination In terms of section 68 (3) of

the Primary Court Procedure Act. The 151 Party Respondent

has made a complaint to the Police on the 16.12.2000, and

the Police filed a report on 08.01.2001, In terms of Section 66

(1) of a land dispute which has given rIse to a breach of the

peace.

Therefore In the light of the above it IS ostensible that the

Party Respondent was IS possession 2 months prIor to the,

The Learned High Court Judge, In the afore said

impugned order dated 25.07.2001 has considered the fact

whether, notice on the 15t Party Respondent should be

issued or not. In that the Learned High Court has, taken m

to consideration of the observation made by the Police

Officer of Hanguranketha Police.

In addition the Learned High Court Judge has considered

the fact that the 2nd Party Respondent has made faulty

description m respect of the disputed Land. Therefore m

the light of the factual and legal matrix the Learned

High Court Judge was of the VIew that the documents

tendered by the pt Party Respondent IS more trustworthy and

have a probative value thereto.

Besides the Learned High

the rationale observed In the case of CA.938/90 decided

that when there IS an opportunity to have recourse to a

permanent relief In a different forum, the Petitioner will not

be entitled to the discretionary remedy of Revis1(ln Fllrther it

was observed by the Learned High Court Judge, the

procedure followed by the original Court.

Hence the Learned High Court Judge was of the VIew

that the Learned Judge of the Primary Court has

not made an order which IS palpably wrong and

obnoxious to the procedure laid down In the Primary

Court procedure Act.

For the reasons as stated here in before, I am of the

VIew that the instant application of the 2nd Party - Respondent

Appellant IS unmeritorious and should stand dismissed.

Hence the appeal IS dismissed accordingly.

Appeal is dismissed Subject to a cost of Rs.5000/-
