Gaffoor J.,

This is an appeal preferred by the Substituted Plaintiff Appellants

(hereinafter referred to as "the Plaintiffs") against the Judgment delivered

by the learned District Judge of Tangalla dated 11.11.1977.

2

The original Plaintiff filed an action seeking inter alia, a declaration of

title to the land set out in the Plaint and eviction of the Defendant and all

others holding under him.

The Defendant filed his answer stating that the land in dispute is

situated within the land which is in possession of Defendant in extent of 1 lh

acres and a land referred to in the plaint is never in existence on the ground

as a separate land.

The Defendant claimed prescriptive title to the land in his possession

on that basis the Defendant moved to dismiss the Plaintiff s action and

sought a declaration to the effect that he has obtained prescriptive title to the

said land.

The facts germane to the case are briefly as follows:

The land called "Kongahawatta" consisting the land depicted in T.P.

283189 in extent of half an acre was belonged to one Selohamy who got title

by purchasing and prescription. Later the aforesaid Selohamy transferred

that land to one Piyoris Appu by virtue of Deed bearing No. 5436 attested on

25.4.1944. Aforesaid Piyoris Appu died intestate and his rights devolved on

his wife and children. Subsequently aforesaid wife namely Sarlanchihamy

transferred her half share to the original Plaintiff and William Singho by

Deed bearing NO. 408 attested on 03.02,1982. Said William singho and

other children who inherited shares upon the demise of their father Piyoris

Appu transferred their rights to the original Plaintiff and thus she became the

sole owner of a land in extent of half an acre. Thereafter the original Plaintiff

and William Singho leased out the said land to one Piyasena in 1971 for a

period of 10 years. It is the allegation of the original Plaintiff that the

Defendant is in unlawful possession of the land ..

The Defendant while denying the averments in the plaint took up the

position that the land claimed by the Plaintiff is situated within a larger land

in extent of one and half acres and no such land is in existence as a separate

and distinct land. Moreover, the Defendants pleaded that one predecessor in

title of the Plaintiff was the sister of the Defendant's father and his rights

remains intact.

It is the stance of the Defendant that he came into possession of the

land claimed by him in 1960 and prior to that his father was in the

possession of the same. On that basis the Defendant claimed prescriptive

title to the whole land including the land in dispute.

The trial commenced on 19 Issues raised at the beginning and one

Jayawardena and Piyasena gave evidence in support of the Plaintiffs case.

When the Plaintiff s case was closed the Defendant gave evidence and

closed his case.

An examination of the impugned judgment reveals that the learned

District Judge has found that the aforementioned Selohamy got title only to

10 perches and her rights passed to the original Plaintiff by virtue of title

deeds marked PI to P4.

It appears that the land claimed by the Plaintiff is one in extent of Yz

acre but it has not been properly identified by way of a commission issued

from the court or otherwise.

Infact the learned trial Judge has clearly found that te original owner

was entitled only to 10 perches though she transferred half an acre

subsequently.

One of the sons of the original Plaintiff in his evidence III cross

examination has stated as follows:

In that sense it is amply clear that the Plaintiff has no certainty of the

land claimed by the original Plaintiff and it is clear that no such land is in

existence distinctly and separately.

In the case of Peeris vs Savunhamy - S.C.121-1951 - 64 NLR page

207 Dias S.P,J held:

"Where in an action for declaration of title to land, the Defendant is in

possession of the land in dispute the burden is on the Plaintiff to prove that

he has dominium;

F or the purpose of identifying the land in dispute, statement of

boundaries in title deeds between third parties are not admissible under

Section 32 of the Evidence Ordinance.

A finding of fact may be reversed on appeal if the trial Judge has

demonstrably misjudged the position."

In a rei vindication action the burden rest on the Plaintiff to prove not

only the title to the land in dispute but also identify the same.

In S.C. Appeal No. 105/10 the Supreme Court has given Leave to

Appeal on the following questions of law:

a) whether the Respondents has discharged the burden of

establishing the identity of the land decried in the

schedule to the Plaint in reference to the Plans referred

to thereat;

b)

c)

Did the Civil Appellate High Court and the District

Court err in law by not taking into consideration the fact

that the Plan FCP o).I60 was not referred to in the

Pennit (oz-I) although it was in existence at the time of

the issuance of the Permit (oz-I)

Did thr Civil Appellate High Court and the District Court

err in law by not taking into account that the boundaries

and the extent described in the Pennit (oz-I) issued to

the Respondent did not tally with the boundaries and the

extent described in the plan (C) 1) in order to properly

identify the corpus;

Ratnayake J., held that:

a) the title of a holder of a pennit under the Land Development

Ordinance is significant to maintain a vindicatory action against

a trespasser :

b) in a vindicatory ctin the burden of proof rests upon the Plaintiff

to prove his title including identification of the boundaries;

c) in a vindicatory action it is necessary to establish the corpus in

a clear and unambiguous manner;

It is my opinion that in the present action the Plaintiff has failed to

prove the land in suit and therefore his action should necessarily fail.

On the other hand the land claimed now appears to be a portion of a

larger land which is in the possession of the Defendant from a considerable

period.

In the circumstances I find no reason to interfere with the findings of

the learned trial Judge.
