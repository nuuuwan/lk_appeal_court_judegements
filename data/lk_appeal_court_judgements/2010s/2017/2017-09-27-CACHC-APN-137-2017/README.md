The above set of prayers make it clear that the Petitioner in this application

seeks to challenge firstly the order dated 2016-04-26, of Colombo High

Court in the Case bearing No. HC/Civil 23/2015/CO and secondly the

progress of further proceedings in Colombo High Court Case bearing No.

HC/Civil/WP 149/2015/ ARB.

At the outset, this Court has to observe the followings;

I. This application has been made under Article 145 and not under 138

of the Constitution.

II. Colombo High Court Case bearing No. HC/CiviljWP 149/2015/ARB

relates to enforcement proceedings of an arbitral award.

III. The supreme Court has rejected the application filed by the Petitioner

seeking leave to appeal against the order dated 2016-04-26, of

Colombo High Court Case bearing No. HC/Civil 23/2015/CO

IV. A copy of the Supreme Court Order has not been produced before

this Court, as it has not been received by the Petitioner yet.

Revisionary jurisdiction of this Court is an extraordinary jurisdiction, which

this Court exercises on its discretion. When a party has a right of appeal it

is exercised only on exceptional circumstances.1

The Petitioner in this case has chosen to go before the Supreme Court

exercising his right of appeal and had not thought of invoking revisionary

jurisdiction of this court until the Supreme Court decided to reject his

application.

The Petitioner also seeks in the same proceedings to stay by way of interim

relief, further proceedings of Colombo High Court Case bearing No.

HC/Civil/WP 149/2015/ARB. In contradistinction to this prayer, the

Petitioner in the written submissions2 has taken up the position that he 'is

not seeking to revise any order judgment or decree of the High Court in

pursuance to any arbitration proceedings which falls under the Arbitration

Act'. 3

Thus, this Court is unable to find any acceptable basis to justify as to why

the Petitioner attempts to halt the progress of Colombo High Court Case

3 Paragraph 15 of his written submissions.

6

No. HC/Civil/WP 149/2015/ARB by way of a stay order to be obtained in

this proceeding.

The above circumstances prompt this Court to refrain from entertaining

this application which is to invoke its extraordinary and discretionary

revisionary jurisdiction.

For the foregoing reasons this Court decides to refuse issuing notices on

the Respondents. The Application must stand dismissed.
