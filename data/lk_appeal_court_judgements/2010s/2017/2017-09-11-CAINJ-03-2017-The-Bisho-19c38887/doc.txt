L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an application for an injunction under article 143 of the

Constitution.

The Petitioners case is that the Government had given a land in extent

of 01 Acre and 01 perch on a Crown Grant in 1854 and a Church was built

in the said land in 1877. A portion of the said land consisting of an extent of

02 Roods and 14 Perches has been sold to the Good Shepherd Convent in

1899. Thereafter in 1962, the Cathedral College which was lying to the

northern and southern boundaries of the church with land in extent of 20

Perches was acquired by the State under the Assisted Schools And Training

Colleges (Supplementary Provisions) Act No.08 of 1961. In 1969 another

portion of land in extant of 5.2 Perches had been acquired by the State. The

Petitioners submit that after all these alienations, the church was left with a

land in extant of 02 Roods and 39.20 Perches.

The Petitioners submit that a survey of the church land had not been

done subsequent to the said dispossessions. They further submit the

t-2

Petitioners wanted to survey the entire land to ascertain the boundaries of

the church land but were denied the permission to survey the school land.

There is no doubt that the Petitioners can survey their own land but

they cannot, as of a right, survey the lands belong to others. It may be true

that the Petitioners were the original owners of the entire land, but either

selling by the Petitioners or acquiring by the State, the Petitioners have lost

the ownership of the said portions.

The Petitioners have submitted a sketch prepared by them showing

the school and church premises and its boundaries. The learned President's

Counsel for the Respondents tendered across the Bar Table certain

photographs showing the ground situation of the school and the church

including the parapet walls. No affidavit is sworn to testify the. truth of the

said photos, but those photographs speak for itself. There are two walls

separating the entrance to the church from the rest of the land. The school

buildings are situated outside the wall which separates the entrance. The

Petitioners have failed to submit any evidence establish that the land beyond

the wall was in the possession of the Petitioners.

The Petitioners submit that the Respondents are constructing a

building encroaching in to the church land. They submit that they have

already send a notice under section 461 of the Civil Procedure Code

indicating that a civil action will be filed and until one month period

expires, they are unable to file an action in a Court of first instance.

Therefore they made this application to this Court under Article 143 of the

Constitution seeking for an injunction to prevent the Respondents from

constructing the building.

As I said earlier, the Petitioners are unaware of the boundaries of the

church land. When this fact is considered with the photographs that show

the school is situated outside the wall separating the entrance to the church,

the Petitioners have failed to establish that the Respondents are constructing

the building in the church premises.

The Petitioners application IS to prevent a school building been

constructed. The building under construction was put on track after

demolishing two existing, buildings. The documents tendered by the learned

President's Counsel for the Respondents are official communications

between Respondents and they establish this fact. If the Court issues an

injunction to prevent the building construction the school children will have

to face immense hardships specially this being a school situated in a small

extent of land. The equitable consideration does not favour the Petitioners.

Under these circumstances, I refuse the application for injunction and

dismiss the application.
