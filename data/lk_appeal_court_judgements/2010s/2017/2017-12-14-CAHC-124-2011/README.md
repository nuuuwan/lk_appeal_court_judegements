Respondent

: 17th November, 2017

: 14th December, 2017

The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of Gampaha

under Section 296 of the Penal Code for the murder of one Halwithana

Athukoralalage Cyril alias Raja. After trial he was convicted under Section

297 of the Penal Code for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. A

jail term of 10 years RI and a fine of Rs. 10,0001= was imposed.

According to Prosecution Witness no. 1 Karunaratne when the

deceased informed him that there was a love affair between his wife and

the appellant has gone to the appellant's house to inquire. On being

questioned by the appellant he has informed him he got to know from the

deceased who was his brother. Later, on the same day Karunaratne had

gone to meet the deceased and the door had been close and he had

observed blood seeping through the door gap, and he had peeped in and

had seen the deceased lying on the floor inside the house. He had

observed a drawer of the cupboard had been broken. He had run out

calling for help.

Karunaratne had gone to the police station to make a complaint

and while going he has met the appellant and told him about the

deceased, and the appellant also had gone to see the deceased.

Prosecution Witness No. 2 son of the deceased in his testimony

had stated that one day prior to the murder the appellant had asked the

deceased for some money. His father had said he had no money and the

appellant had threatened the deceased saying "~~ffi C@ ~" .The

witness says that the deceased used to keep his money in a drawer in

the Almyrah, which had been broken subsequently. The deceased had

been lying near this Almyrah. Prosecution Witness NO.7 retired C.1.

Bandara who visited the scene of the crime had observed the broken

down Almyrah. Therefore the fact that the cupboard was broken open

had been established by police evidence.

Prosecution Witness No. 2 has further testified that the appellant

had quarreled with his father about a week prior to the incident, and that

his father had no enemies other than the appellant.

Prosecution Witness NO.3 in his evidence had testified that on the

day in question he heard a yell while he was in his vegetable plot close

to the deceased's house. Later he had heard that the deceased had been

killed.

Prosecution Witness NO.6 the Judicial Medical Officer testified that

he found 20 wounds on the victim. He had observed a wound on the neck

as a serious injury which is capable of causing death in the ordinary

course of nature. Further he had stated the injuries observed on the body

could have been caused by the knife marked P2.

I f Prosecution Witness NO.7 C.1. Bandara testified that the appellant f. I i I

was apprehended at the Wilwatte Railway Station on information

received. The appellant had started running after seeing the police. He

was apprehended after giving chase. The appellant in his dock statement

has not denied this position. This shows the subsequent conduct of the

I

e l

appellant which is relevant under Section 8 (2) of the Evidence

Ordinance.

Subsequent to the appellant's statement to the police a Section 27

(1) of the Evidence Ordinance recovery was made. A blood stained knife

was found, which was sent to the Government Analyst who reported that

4

f t l I r

it is human blood. This was not challenged by the defence at the trial and

~ I

f

the report of the Government Analyst had been admitted under section

420 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The appellant's counsel argued that the learned High Court Judge

had relied on two items of evidence namely the appellant threatening the

deceased on a previous occasion regarding some money and the Section

27 (1) recovery. If one takes the above statement in isolation it may not

have a grave effect but when it is taken with the act that followed the

statement it shows the murderous intention of the appellant.

The Section 27 (1) recovery when considered with the

circumstances of the case establishes the guilt of the appellant. The other

ground urged by the appellant was that the learned High Court Judge

erred by referring to the inquest proceedings recorded by the Magistrate.

Although there is no provision in place to refer to such evidence we find

that there is no prejudice caused to the appellant by referring to those

statements. Therefore this ground too fails.

In the instant case the learned High Court Judge had convicted the

appellant on circumstantial evidence.

5

In the case of King vs Abeywickrema 44 NlR 2554 it was held

that in order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury

must be satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the

accused and inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of his

innocence.

In King vs Appuhamy 46 NlR 128 it was held that in order to

justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial evidence the

inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused

and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable hypothesis than

that of guilt.

In Podisingho vs King 53 NlR 49 it was held that in the case of

circumstantial evidence it is the duty of the trial judge to tell the Jury that

such evidence must be totally inconsistent with the innocence of the

accused and must only be consistent with his guilt.

In Emperor vs Brown 1917 18 Cri.L.J. 482 court held that the

Jury must decide whether the facts proved exclude the possibility that the

act was done by some other person, and if they have doubts the prisoner

must have the benefits of those doubts.

"

j j In Don Sunny vs Attorney General 1998 2 SlR 1 it was held that

the charges sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the items of

circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.

Considering the evidence and arguments brought forward by the

respective counsel our considered view is that the prosecution has

proved the case beyond reasonable doubt in the High Court.

Now the question arises as to why the learned High Court Judge

convicted the appellant under Section 297 of the Penal Code. An accused

can be convicted under Section 297 only if the evidence falls with the four

provisos of Section 294 of the Penal Code. In the instant case I'm of the

view that the evidence presented does not fall under the provisos set

under Section 294 of the Penal Code. Therefore I decide to set aside

conviction and the sentence dated 14/12/2011 and convict the appellant

under Section 296 of the Penal Code, for murder. The learned High Court

Judge is directed to impose the death sentence adhering to Section 280

of the Criminal Procedure Code.
