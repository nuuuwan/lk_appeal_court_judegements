The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant preferred this appeal to set aside the order

of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo dated 9/3/2005 in case No HCRA

446/2003 and dismiss the order of the Learned Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia dated

7/11/2003 in case No 58139 and to declare that there is no unauthorized structure

constructed by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant own legal rear space at

premises No 10, Dakshinarama Road, Mt. Lavinia.

The Learned High Court Judge of Colombo by his order dated 9/3/2005 dismiss

the application of revision of the order of the Learned Magistrate ofMt. Lavinia

delivered on 711112003 in case No 58139 filed by the Applicant-Respondent-

Respondent on the ground that there is no exceptional circumstances have been

pleaded by the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant. The Respondent-Petitioner-

Law Section 23(5) No 41 of 1978 and Section 28(a) (3) of the said Act by the

Municipal Council of the Mt. Lavinia. The effect of the Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant has erected an unauthorized structure at No 10 Dhakshinarama Road,

Mt. Lavinia. That this construction had been done in the legal rear space and that

The Learned Hon Magistrate of Mt. Lavinia after perusing the sketches dated

3/5/2000 and 24/8/2003 both of which marked PI of an alleged unauthorized

structure has been satisfied with the contents of PI and has made order that this

structure depicted as P I to be demolished.

The provisions of Section 23(5) of the UDA of Law 41 of 1978 stated as follows,

"The authority may delegate to any officer of a local authority, in

consultation with that local authority, any of its powers, duties and

functions relating to planning within any area declared to be a

development area under section 3, and such officer shall exercise,

perform or discharge any such power, duty or function so delegated,

under the direction, supervision and control of the authority. "

It was submitted that the Respondent Petitioner Appellant that the application of

the applicant dated 25/1/2001 is misconceived and urge to dismiss this

application of the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent in limine as it is unlawful.

The Appellant had totally violated the Urban Development Authority

regulations when he constructed a toilet in extent 4.10 Perches without obtaining

permission from the Municipal Council. According to the Urban Development

Authority Act and its regulators there should be a rear space 7 Y2 feet in extent

from the building to the boundary wall. The Appellant did not comply with the

said regulations as well as with the direction given by the notice and as such the

Respondent filed this application in the Magistrate Court ofMt. Lavinia in terms

of section 28(a) (3) of the Urban Development Authority Act No 41 of 1978 as

amended by Act No 4 of 1982 and 44 of 1984 seeking authority of Court to

demolish the said unauthorized construction.

Section 28 (3) (a) of the Urban Development Authority Act states as follows,

" 3(a) When any person has failed to comply with any requirement contained

any written notice issued under sub section (J) within the time specified

in the notice or within such extended time as may have been granted by

the authority. The authority may be way of petition and affidavit apply to

the Magistrate to make an order authorizing the authority to .....

(b) to demolish or alter any building or work"

We find that the Learned Magistrate has gone outside a limited powers and

had considered all the grounds set out by the Appellant and being satisfied

that there are no merits in them has rejected them. The Appellant has been

given an opportunity to show cause, but the Appellant has failed to show

any valid reasons. On being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned

Magistrate a revision application bearing No. HCRA 446/03 in the

Provincial High Court of the Western Province Holden at Colombo has

been filed. Parties conceded to resolve the matter by way of written

submissions. This revision application was dismissed by the Learned High

Court Judge on the ground that there was no exceptional circumstances to

invoke the revisionary jurisdiction. We are in agreement with the Learned

High Court Judge and find that there has been no exceptional circumstances

pleaded to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction. Hence we find that we do not

have to look in to the merits of this appeal. Accordingly we affirm the

judgment dated 9/3/2005 of the Learned High Court Judge and dismiss this

Appeal without cost.
