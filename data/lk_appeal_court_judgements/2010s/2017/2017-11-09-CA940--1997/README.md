The Plaintiff - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted action

in the District Court of Galle by Plaint dated 21.04.1992 seeking inter alia;

a) A declaration of title in favour of the Plaintiff over the corpus,

b) To eject the defendant and all those who hold under her and handover

peaceful and vacant possession to the Plaintiff,

c) Damages.

Summons was duly served on the Defendant - Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the Defendant) and a proxy was tendered on her behalf on 17.02.1993.

Thereafter a commISSIOn was issued to survey and identify the corpus and

consequently Plan bearing No. 1767 prepared by A. A. de Silva Licensed Surveyor

was tendered to Court on 18.11.1993.

On 24.08.1994 an amendment to the Plaint was sought and the same was not

objected to by the learned Counsel for the Defendant (vide Journal Entry 15) and

thereafter the learned Counsel for the Defendant sought time till 09.11.1994 to

tender the Answer of the Defendant to Court. As the Presidential Election was due

to be held on 09.11.1994 since it was declared a holiday and the case was

mentioned on 22.03.1995 on which date the Defendant was granted time finally

till 31.05.1995 to file Answer. When the case was called on 31.05.1995 the

Defendant failed to file answer and further she was absent and unrepresented and

therefore the case was fixed for ex - parte hearing on 09.10.1995.

When the ex - parte hearing commenced an application was made on behalf of the

Plaintiff to re-amend the Plaint as the amended Plaint had not clearly identified the

corpus (vide page 43 of the Appeal brief). Thereafter, Court having considered the

application allowed for the re-amendment to the Plaint.

Thereafter ex - parte hearing recommenced on 16.05.1996 and after the evidence

of the Plaintiff was led the learned District Judge delivered judgment on

07.06.1996 in favour of the Plaintiff and the ex - parte decree was served on the

Defendant.

Thereafter the Defendant preferred an application under Section 86 (2) of the Civil

Procedure Code by Petition dated 09.10.1996 to purge default and to vacate the ex

- parte decree and further to be allowed to file her Answer.

The matter was thereafter fixed for inquiry on 18.12.1996 on which date the parties

had agreed to conclude the matter by way of written submissions and the

respective written submissions were tendered to Court.

Consequently the learned District Judge delivered order dated 27.05.1997

dismissing the application of the Defendant to vacate the ex - parte decree. Being

aggrieved by the said order the Defendant preferred the instant appeal by Petition

dated 25.07.1997 to set aside the impugned order dated 27.05.1997 and to allow

for the Defendant to enter the case.

The learned Counsel for the Defendant raises a question of law which was not

contained in the Petition of Appeal dated 25.07.1997, which is; Is the Plaintiff

entitled to amend the Plaint after fixing the case for ex - parte trial?

Section 758 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code states;

"The court in deciding any appeal shall not be confined to the grounds set

forth by the appellant, but it shall not rest its decision on any ground not set

forth by the appellant, unless the respondent has had sufficient opportunity

of being heard on that ground."

Considering the fact that the Defendant in the instant appeal has had sufficient

notice of the above ground of Appeal this Court will first consider the said

question of Law raised by the learned Counsel for the Defendant.

It is evident and as admitted by the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff the amended

Plaint dated 06.07.1994 was subsequently amended by Plaint dated 24.10.1995 on

which the impugned judgment was delivered.

It is clear that the said amendment was allowed on an application made by the

Plaintiff to clearly identify the corpus as the amended Plaint dated 06.07.1994 did

not clearly reflect the corpus. The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff contends that

the said amendment was only the inclusion of the 2nd paragraph with regards to the

identity of the corpus and further that the relief sought in the re - amended Plaint is

identical to the reliefs sought in the amended Plaint.

However, it is clear that the said amendment was allowed on the basis that the

corpus was not clearly identified in the amended Plaint. Although the learned

Counsel for the Plaintiff contends that the reliefs prayed for in the amended plaint

could have been achieved without adding paragraph 2 referred to above, this Court

" finds that such relief could not have been achieved in respect on the corpus since,

as admitted by the Plaintiff, the corpus was not clearly identified in amended Plaint

dated 06.07.1994.

In the case of Gunasekera V s. Punchimenike and others 2002 (2) SLR 43

Wigneshwaran J held that;

"A Court should not allow amendment of pleadings after an ex parte trial has

been ordered. The scheme of the Code had been where the defendant is

absent on the day fixed for his appearance and answer, trial ex parte should

be held either immediately or as the next step."

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff argues that the ratio in the above judgment

has no relevance to the instant Appeal as the matter ought to be distinguished on

the facts. Counsel further argues that unlike in the said case no material prejudice

has been caused to the Defendant by the said amendment.

It must be noted that as per Section 93(2) of the Civil Procedure Code amendment

of any pleadings may be allowed only where grave and irremediable injustice will

be caused if such amendment is not permitted. Section 92(2) reads;

i l I ! i

"On or after the day first fixed for the trial of the action and before final

judgement, no application for the amendment of any pleadings shall be

allowed unless the Court is satisfied, for reasons to be recorded by the Court,

that grave and irremediable injustice will be caused if such amendment is

not permitted, and on no other ground, and that the party so applying has not

been guilty of laches.

Therefore, this Court finds that the reason to allow the application made on behalf

of the Plaintiff to amend pleadings was so that, 'grave and irremediable injustice'

would not be caused to the Plaintiff.

In Gunasekera V s. Punchimenike and others 2002 (2) SLR 43 Wigneshwaran J

further held that;

"All these observations point to the fact that the plaint cannot be allowed to

be amended at this stage. The plaintiff cannot be allowed to point out the

defects in his own evidence and pleadings and allowed to take steps to

supplement his evidence without the knowledge of the defendant. To do so

or to allow the plaintiff to do so, would open the flood gates to plaintiffs

filing plaints of one sort and obtaining an ex parte decree of another sort

without notice to the defendants. Any attempt to change or amend the

pleadings must necessarily be preceded by notice to all parties to the action."

As such an amendment of pleadings relating to the identity of the corpus is a

central issue and as such this Court finds that is bad procedure to allow for the

amendment of proceedings after ex parte trial has been ordered and especially

II

where some evidence has been led ex parte and therefore holds with the learned

Counsel for the Defendant on the question of law raised on Appeal.

For the reasons morefully described above this Appeal is allowed. The order of the

c learned District Judge dated 27.05.1997 is hereby set aside. The Substituted

Defendant Appellants are hereby allowed to enter the case and to file Answer.

Appeal Allowed.
