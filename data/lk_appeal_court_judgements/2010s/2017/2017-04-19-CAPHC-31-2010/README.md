The 1 st and 2nd accused were detected by the police while

transporting 40 heads of cattle in a lorry without a permit in a cruel

manner and were brought before the Court. The 3 rd Accused Petitioner

Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Appellant)

who was the owner of the cattle was present in Court and on the direction

of the learned Magistrate he was also made an accused. The charge sheet,

3

where the charges were framed against the all three accused is not

available in the record but according to the plaint filed by the police

against the 1 st and 2nd Accused the charges were charged under section

4(2) of the Butchers ordinance and section 2( 1) of the Cruelty to Animal

Act as amended. All the accused pleaded guilty to the charges and were

fined Rs. 250/- each on each count with a default term of sentence of one

month.

The learned Magistrate held an inquiry in relation to the cattle

where the Appellant gave evidence and claimed the cattle. He gave

evidence and said that he is the owner of the cattle. He was taking them to

the Mosque to be slaughtered on the Hajj festival day. The learned

Magistrate was of the view that the cattle being less than 12 years of age,

they cannot be slaughtered, confiscated them. Being aggrieved by this

order, the Appellant moved in revision in the High Court of Kandy

without success. This appeal is from the order of the High Court Kandy.

There is no provision in law to confiscate cattle under Animal Act,

Cruelty to Animals Act or Butchers ordinance. The purpose of

transporting cattle is not a material fact. The question is the way of

transporting them. Whether it is with a valid permit issued by the relevant

authority or not and whether the transportation is done in a cruel manner.

The Accused were punished for violating the law in transporting the

cattle. They cannot be burdened with an additional punishment of

forfeiture of the cattle considering the purpose of transporting them.

Forfeiture of the vehicle used to commit the offence as an

additional punishment is provided by the Legislature in several laws such

as Forest Ordinance, Excise Ordinance and Animal Act. Under section

40( 1) of the Forest Ordinance it has been enacted that all timber or forest

produce which is not the property of the State in respect of which such

offence has been committed shall, by reason of such conviction, be

4

forfeited to the State. There is no like prOVISIOn In laws relating

transporting cattle to confiscate them.

It has been held by this Court in several cases that there is no

provision to confiscate cattle under Cruelty to Animal Act. In the case of

C.A. case No. 614/85 decided on 01.11.1985 Moonamalle J. held so. In

C.A. case Nos. 615/85 and 616/85 decided on 18.11.1985, T.D.G. De

Alvis J. also released the cattle on the same basis. C.A. Application No.

403/85 decided on 09.05.1985 H.A.G.de Silva J. also accepted that there

is no provision to confiscate cattle.

The Court cannot utilize the inherent power of the Court granted

under section 7 of the Criminal Procedure Code to impose an additional

financial burden to an accused or in that case to any person, which was

not provided by law.

I set aside the order of the learned Magistrate and the learned High

Court Judge confiscating the cattle and order to release them to the

Appellant, if they are among living, since this case has taken a long time.

Appeal allowed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

H.C.J.Madawala J.

I agree.
