CA 179/2016 HC-ANURADHAPURA-165/2009

Before Deepali Wijesundera, J. &

L.O.Jayasuriya, J.

Counsel Mohoamed Rafi for the Accused Appellant

Rohantha Abeysuriya, DSG for AG

Argued &

Decided on 28.07.2017

Deepali Wijesundera, J.

Accused Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Anuradhapura

for the murder of one Kandepitawaththe Gedara Lal Sisira Kumara.

After trial, he has pleaded guilty for the lesser offence which is under Section 297 of the Penal Code, culpable homicide not

amounting to murder.

He was sentenced to 8 years Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of

Rs. SOOO/-with a default term of 3 months and also he has been

ordered to pay Rs. 200,000/-as compensation to the family of

the deceased with a default term of 2 years.

Counsel for the Appellant informs court that he is only

canvassing the sentence and not the conviction since the

appellant has pleaded guilty in the High Court.

Considering the submissions made and the evidence given in this

case, we decide to reduce the sentence from 8 years to 6 years

and the sentence to commence from the date of conviction which is 20.10.2016. Other conditions imposed will remain as it is.

subject to the above variations, the appeal is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

L.U. Jayasuriya, J.

I agree.
