The Accused Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Jaffna

under Sec. 296 of the Penal Code for the murder of Thilagaraja Jagath

Janani on 02/05/2003 and also under Sec. 383 of the Penal Code for

committing robbery of gold jewellery for the value of Rs. 124,0001=. The

appellant was convicted for the lesser offence which is culpable homicide

not amounting to murder on the first charge and also for the second

charge and convicted for 10 years RI for both charges.

The grounds of appeal urged by the counsel for the appellant was

that the identification parade was improperly constituted, in support of this

argument the learned counsel should have produced the parade notes

but he did not do so. However he argued that the parade was held 356

days after the incident and cited the judgment in Roshan vs AG 2011 1

SLR 364. It was held in that case by holding parade belatedly 50 days

after the incident the court has failed to consider the impact on the

witnesses to identify the accused after the unreasonable delay in holding

the parade. This can not be applied to the instant case since the appellant

had absconded after the incident.

Inspector A.H.M. Rajan has stated in his evidence that the

appellant was arrested on suspicion in Jaffna eleven months after the

incident. This fact clearly shows that the accused appellant was

absconding for a considerable period of time.

,

Although the learned counsel for the appellant argued that the

prosecution failed to produce circumstantial evidence to prove their case

this does not arise since the accused was convicted on the evidence of

an eye witness namely Anthoney Yesudasen, whos evidence was not

contradicted.

I find that the eye witness has seen the deceased grappling with

the accused seconds before the body was recovered. The medical

evidence shows that the deceased's right ear lobe was torn and this

suggests that her ear rings have been removed forcibly. This establishes

the second court.

The accused while giving evidence has stated on the day of the

incident he was in Kytes and has set up a defence of alibi. On perusal of

the brief I have discovered that he has not given notice of alibi as provided

by Sec. 126 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Therefore I am

not inclined to consider this argument.

Considering the totality of evidence presented by the prosecution I

hold that the case for the prosecution has been proved beyond

reasonable doubt and the learned High Court Judge has come to his

finding after carefully considering the evidence placed before him.

Therefore I see no merit in the arguments placed before this court.

I affirm the judgment and conviction given by the learned High

Court Judge on 01/11/2012 and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
