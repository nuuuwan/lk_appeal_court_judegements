H.C.J. Madawala, J.

Heard Counsel in support of the Petition of this reVISIon

application dated 01.02.2017. In the said application it is stated that

the surety failed to abide by the order dated 13.09.2012 of the learned

I Iigh Court Judge. The learned lligh Court Judge implemented the

order of his predecessor by confiscating the bail bond and sentencing

the Petitioner for a period of 3 V2 years as stated in the order dated

07.01.2016. The facts emerged from the above petition are as follows:

The petitioner stood as a surety for the accused named Mohamed

lsaqe Mohamed Washeem who was charged for committing the

offence of possession of heroin which punishable under Poison Opium

and Drugs Act No. 13 of 1984 m High court Case No. 5697/201l.

The Petitioner stood as a surety for the accused and the accused was

enlarged on bail by the High Court Judge. Due to the facts that the

accused had been evading the Court proceedings and that the petitioner

failed to bring the accused though he had been given sufficient time

for that purpose the learned High Court Judge called the petitioner to

show cause as surety why the bond should not be fortified on

13.09.2012. The learned High Court Judge ordered the bond to be

fortified carrying a default sentence of f()Ur years Rigorous Imprisonment.

The surety paid a sum of Rs. 12,5001= as a part payment and

permISSIOn was granted for him to make it in installments. The

petitioner failed to abide by the order dated 13.09.2012 and the

learned High Court Judge implemented the order of his predecessor

subject to a minor variation that the rigorous imprisonment of four

years to be operated as 3 Yz years of the order dated 07.01.2016. The

Petitioner being aggrieved by the order dated 07.0l.2016 moved in

revision against the sentence due to the following exceptional grounds.

That the order dated 07.01.2016 is totally illegal and in contravention

of the procedure laid in Section 422 of the Criminal Procedure Act

No. 15 of 1979 where it permits the Court to sentence a surety only

for six month simple imprisonment as a final remedy.

The learned D.S.G. Varunika Hettige informs Court that

she has no objection for the application made by the Petitioner. Having

considered the above circumstances that has occurred in securing the

presence of the 1st accused the learned High Court Judge having

gIven an opportunity to show cause has forfeited the bond and

sentenced the petitioner to 3 V2 years R.I. thus it is crystal clear

that the said impugned order of the learned High Court Judge IS

patently erroneous and should be set aside forthwith.

Counsel for the Petitioner informs Court that the Petitioner

surety had already served the sentence of 1 year and 4 months as

such having considered the Petition Affidavit and documents and the

oral submissions we set aside the order dated 07.01.2016 forthwith

and amend same to read as six months R.I. and direct the learned

High Court Judge to release the Petitioner surety forthwith.
