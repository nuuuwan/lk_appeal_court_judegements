P. PADMAN SURASENA, J.

This matter was taken up for argument. Learned

President's Counsel for the respondent-petitioner-1 st respondent

and the learned Counsel for the petitioner were heard in support of

their respective cases. Learned Counsel for both parties conceded

the followings:_

(i) The applicant-respondent 2nd respondent namely the

Commissioner of Municipal Council, Jaffna had filed one

single case for the purposes of seeking a mandatory

demolition order under Section 28 (A)(3) and for

prosecution of the person responsible for that

construction under Section 28(1) of the Urban

f " Development Authority Law as amended (hereinafter

referred to as UDA Law).

(ii) that the best course of action for the Commissioner of

Municipal Council, Jaffna to have field two separate

cases for these purposes

(iii) that the Commissioner of Municipal Council, Jaffna had

not filed either an affidavit or a sketch or any report by a

technical officer along with the application seeking a

mandatory order for demolition.

In the light of the above factual positions it is the view

of both parties that the proceedings pertaining to this case is

vitiated ab-initio. This Court is also of the view that it would be in

the best interest of all parties that the Municipal Council of

Jaffana takes initiative to file two separate cases before Court

according to law.

Learned Counsel for the petitioner wishes to place on

record before this Court that it would not be open for the

respondent-petitioner-1 st respondent to take up the position that

there was no affidavit filed by the Municipal Council as that

objection was not taken up before the Magistrate's Court or even

before the High Court.

In the circumstances, we decide to set aside the order

dated 2012.06. 22 made by the learned High Court of Jaffna as

well as the order dated2012.03. 12 made by the learned

Magistrate's Court of J affna.

It would be open for any authorities concerned to file

suitable applications before the relevant Magistrate's Court in

respect of the orders that were initially sought in the single case

filed before the Magistrate of Jaffna in this case.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

K. K. WICKREMASINGHE, J.

I agree.
