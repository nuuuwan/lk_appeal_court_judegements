The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants preferred this appeal to revise and

to set aside the order ofthe Learned High Court Judge of Ham ban tot a dated

4/6/2008 in case No. HCRAl1112008 and for further to set aside the order

dated 23/4/2008 in case No 36317 in the Primary Court ofThissamaharama

and to acquit the Appellants from the conviction that has been made and

for further relief as prayed for in the prayer of the petition.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellants is seeking to have an order

made by the Learned High Court Judge of Hambantota delivered on

4/6/2008 wherein the Application of the Petitioner under No. HCRA

1112008 which was dismissed on the alleged non-compliance of the

Provisions of Rule 3(1) of the Appellate Court Procedure Rules of

1990 as amended.

The position ofthe Petitioner was that the said alleged basis on which the

revision application of the Appellants was dismissed, was erroneous and

palpably wrong and thus the Appellants are entitled in law to obtain the

relief prayed from this court.

In the said reVISIOn application bearing No. HCRAl1112008, the

Appellants challenged the orders of the Learned Magistrate dated

12/03/2008 and 23/04/2008 wherein the Appellants were found guilty of

an offence under section 73 ofthe Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of

1979 as amended for contravention of an order made there under. The

Appellants have been punished with 6 months rigorous imprisonment

which has been suspended for a period of 5 years.

On 1811112016 the Respondent was absent and unrepresented and the

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant who was represented by the counsel was

directed to file written submissions by the Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant was submitted to court on 8/12/2016 and judgment was reserved

due on or 15/02/2017 and was postponed to date.

The Learned High Court Judge on 416/2008 in his order had stated that

the Applicant-Respondent had not submitted the 16 documents which was

to be tendered to court and hence contravened the provisions of section

3(1) of the Appellate Court Procedure Rules and has dismissed the

application.

On a perusal of the record the Petitioner has submitted the documents

marked @ol, @o2, @o3, @o4, @o5, @o6, @o7, @o7(1),@o7(2),

@o7(3),@o7(4),@o7(5),@o7(6),@07(7),@o8,@o8(1),@o8(2),

@o8(3),@o8(4),@o8(5)

It was a contention of the Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant that only the

documents that is material to the actions has been submitted to this court.

Namely;

(a) The very right of the Appellant to occupy the premIses

springing from the settlement marked Plea);

(b) The said settlement has been reached considering the rights of

the tenant cultivator to have a place of dwelling in the paddy

field cultivated by him! her;

(c) None of the aforesaid orders have ordered the demolition of the

very house as opposed to any extensions being made;

(d) The order of the Learned Magistrate to demolish the very house

in which the Appellant lives is against the categorical statutorily

protected rights of the Appellant.

It was submitted that an express reservation was made praying for the

opportunity to call for the entire case record which would have removed

any hindrance in looking in to all the documents placed on record.

7 )

f t ! However we find that the order of conviction and term of suspended

sentence has already lapsed we do not think that we should interfere with

the order ofthe Learned Magistrate. We also do not think that the Learned

High Court Judge has erred in this matter and hence we dismiss this appeal

without costs.
