The 5th Defendant Appellant has preferred this appeal to set aside the judgment

dated 04/06/1998 and for further relief as prayed for in the prayer of the Petition

dated 22/07/1998. This matter was fixed for argument on 15/06/2016 and

argument was concluded and Counsels to moved for date to file written

submissions. Both parties have file their written submissions and judgment was

reserved for 23/09/2016 and thereafter postpone for 13/02/2017.

The Plaintiff Respondent instituted this action to partition the land called

"Kukuladagoda watte" or "Mahaaramba W atte" in extent of 8 lahas. The

Plaintiff possession was that in his pedigree the original owner ofParakatawelle

Diddeniyegedera Muhandiram and that the said Muhandiram had two children.

Namely,

1- Wattegedara Ran Ethana and

2- Wattegedara Appu Naide

The Plaintiffs claimed the said Ran Ethana had conveyed her share to the 1 st

Plaintiff who then became entitled to an undivided half share of the corpus. The

Appellant possession was that the said Muhandiram had more than two children,

and took up the position that the said Muhandiram's had seven children. Namely,

1) Appu Naide ,2) Ran Naide, 3) Ran Ethana, 4) Menikhamy,

5) Ukku Ethana, 6) Abaran Appu, 7) Kiri Appu with an undivided 117 share

devolving on each of them. The Appellant also stated that the Plaintiffs was

seeking to partition 8 lahas out of a much larger land. The Appellant had

purchased the shares of Manikhamy and Abaran Appu. Furthermore, he was

entitled to another 1114 share in the corpus as one of the 7 children of Appu

Naide. Thus, the Appellant claimed 5/14 shares in the corpus. When the case

was taken up for trial two admissions were recorded.

1) The Kandyan Law was applicable to the parties,

5

2) That the said Muhandiram was the original owner of the corpus.

The Learned District Judge delivered his judgment on 4/6/1998 accepting the

contention of the Plaintiffs both with regard to the corpus and the pedigree.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment dated 4/6/1998 the 5th Defendant-

Appellant appeal against the said judgment of the following grounds of appeal,

a) the said judgment is contrary to law and the weight of evidence led,

b) the Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the deeds produced by the

Appellant in deciding whether the entire land had been surveyed,

c) the Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the devolution of title as

set out in the earlier judgment in case No 56881P,

d) the Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider the evidence ofManikhamy

who was one of Muhandiram' s daughters.

When this matter came up for argument on 15/6/2016 the 1 st and 2nd Plaintiff-

Respondent make argument that the original owner of Muhandiram had 7

children and not two, as pleaded by the Plaintiff an issue No 10. The burden of

proof lies on the 5th Defendant Vide Gunasekara Vs. Latheef 1991 Vol 1

pg.365 it was held,

\,

\t

\t 6 I

"While 8.101 Evidence Ordinance is concerned with the duty

to prove a case as a whole, viz the overall burden of proof 8.

103 regulates the burden of proof as to a particular facts,

however the devolution of the overall burden is governed by S.

102 which declares that the burden of proof lies on that person

who would fail if no such evidence at all were given on either

side. When the legal title to the premises is admitted or proved

to be in the plaintiff the burden of proof is on the defendant to

show he is in lawful possession- defendant must begin the

case ".

It was contended that the 5th Defendant-Appellant did not raises any issues in

respect of whether parties are governed by Kandyan Law. Therefore the 5th

Defendant-Appellant cannot now claim rights under the Kandyan Law. Vide

Piyadasa and another Vs. Babanis and another 2006 Vol 2 pg 17 it was held,

"On a question of fact the appellants cannot abdicate for the

first time in appeal withoutfirst having contested the matter

in the Original Court".

It was contended that the Learned District Judge has very clearly come to the

following findings at page 5 and 6 of his judgment.

It was contended the 5th Defendant is estopped from taken up the position that,

Muhandiram had 7 children and as he had denied the same in his previous action.

Therefore the Learned Trial Judge has correctly answered issue No 10 not

proved. Accordingly the question of illegitimate children succeeding under the

Kandyan Law does not arise.

The 5th Defendant in his answer dated 17/05/1995 para 3 has stated that legal

heirs ofMuhandiram are his 07 children namely, IF I

~

i t , f I \

8

Parakadawelle Dikdeniya Gedara Appu Naide , Ran Naide, Ran Ethana,

Menikhamy, Ukku Ethana, Abaran Appu, And Kiri Appu. Further he has stated

the two daughters were married in "Deega" under the Kandyan Law. However

the 5th Defendant had not indicate that the said property of Muhandiram is

acquired property.

Under Section 15 of the Kandyan Law declaration and Amendment Ordinance

its states as follows,

15. When a man shall die intestate after the commencement of this ordinance

leaving an illegitimate child or illegitimate children-

(a) such child or children shall have no right of inheritance in respect of the

paraveni property of the deceased;

(b) such child or children shall, subject to the interests of the surviving

spouse, if any , be entitled to succeed to the acquired property of the

deceased in the event of three being no legitimate child or the

descendant of a legitimate child of the deceased;

(c) any such child shall, subject to the interests of the surviving spouse, if

any, be entitled to succeed to the acquired property of the deceased

equally with a legitimate child or the legitimate children, as the case

may be-

(i) if the deceased intestate had registered himself as the father of that

child when registering the birth of that child. In the devolution of the

estate of any person who shall die intestate after the commencement

of this Ordinance, ( a) whenever the estate or any part thereof shall

devolve upon heirs other than a child or the descendant of a child,

and such heirs are in relation to one another brothers or sisters, or

brothers and sisters, or the descendants of any deceased brother or

sister, such heirs shall inherit inter se the like

(ii) if the deceased intestate had in his lifetime been adjudged by any

competent court to be the father of that child.

The Learned District Judge of Kandy have not considered that under that

Kandyan Law whether a child is legitimate or illegitimate even an illegitimate

child can inherit like legitimate child inherit their fathers property if it is acquired

property. Further, when there are legitimate children and illegitimate child or

children can inherit the father's property, if the fathers name is registered in the

Birth Certificate of illegitimate children as the father.

The Learned District Judge in answering issue No 10 (a) and (b) has stated that

the said issue has not been proved. On a perusal of the record I find that

10

Muhandiram died leaving both legitimate and illegitimate children. The Plaintiff

has failed to plead in his Plaint that the property to partition owned by

Muhandiram was paraveni property. The Learned District Judge has failed to

peruse P5 regarding the devolution of title from Muhandiram.

In the case No DCI 5688 parties have admitted that the 6th Defendant Ran Ethana

and 7th Defendant Punchi Hamy were married out in "deega" his illegitimate

children were the deceased Plaintiff Ran Naide and 1 st to the 4th Defendants.

The Learned District Judge in his judgment had stated that issue No 10 has not

been proved due to the fact that only the birth certificate of Ran Naide has been

submitted for his perusal. As such since the 5th Defendant has failed to tender

the relevant documents namely the birth certificate. The Learned District Judge

has answered the issue No 10 in the negative. On a perusal of the judgment in

case No DC 5688 it has been determined that Muhandiram has 5 illegitimate

children. It was contended by the 1st and 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent that the

Appellants cannot abdicate for the 1 st time in appeal without 1 st having contested

the matter in the original court. We find that the Plaintiff had not complied with

section 4( d) of the Partition Law of 1997. In that the Plaintiff has failed to

indicate whether the property to be partitioned is paraveni or acquired property.

The Plaintiff has failed to comply with section 4( c) or 4, 5 of the Partition Law

in that the Plaintiff should have named the illegitimate children of the original

owner which the Plaintiff has failed to do. Further the Learned District Judge has

failed to comply with Section 20 (1) (b) of the Partition Law. Section 20 (1) (b)

of the Partition Law stated that the court shall order notice of the partition action

to be sent by registered post to every person disclosed under paragraph "c" of

sub section "1" of section 19 by the Defendant in the action.

The Substituted 5th Defendant Appellant also submitted that a daughter under

the Kandyan Law inherits the father's property, only in certain circumstances.

They are, (1) if the daughter is married in binna or

(2) if the daughter is married after the father's death.

The 1 st Plaintiffs mother Ran Ethana was married in binna or married after the

death of Muhandiram should have been averred by the Plaintiff to claim any

rights from his mother on that ground of she were to inherit her father's property.

It was submitted that there is not an iota of evidence produced on behalf of the

Plaintiff that Ran Ethana was married in binna or Ran Ethana was married after

the death ofMuhandiram. The Learned District Judge has held that the evidence

\

I

is insufficient to establish that those sisters of the 5th Defendant were married in

deega.

It was submitted that the trial judge has failed to come to a conclusion how the

Plaintiffs the mother became entitle to any share of a property in question in

answering issue No lOA the Learned District Judge should have considered not

only P 5 tendered by the Plaintiffs and 5 V 4 tendered by the 5th Defendant. He

should have considered the evidence given by one of the 7 children of the said

original owner Muhandiram, that is Manikhamy. Manikhamy gave evidence at

the trial and was subjected to cross-examination by the Plaintiff. This evidence

has never been considered by the Learned District Judge. Manik Hamy gave

evidence and stated that her father is Muhandiram and Muhandiram had 3

children from Loku Amma.Namely, Punchi Hamy, Appu Naide and Ran Ethana

and that her mother had 5 children. Namely,

Ran Naide, Manik Hamy, Ukku Ethana, Mohandiram and Kiri Appu.

She also stated that Muhandiram had 2 wives. She also stated in her evidence

that her father has given his name in certain birth certificates. It was submitted

that the Learned District Judge had failed to consider the document marked 5V9

which is a birth certificate of one of the 7 children. It was submitted that

~ , ( !

13

Muhandiram has signed as the informant. Accordingly it was submitted that the

Learned District Judge has failed to investigate the title in light of this evidence.

We hold that the duty cast on the trial judge under section 25 of the Partition

Law has not been discharged. Since she has failed to find or come to a conclusion

how the Plaintiff s mother became entitled to any share to the property in

question.

The Plaintiff and the 5th Defendant Respondent has admitted that Muhandiram

is the original owner of the property to be partition. However the Plaintiff in his

written submissions had stated that the property was owned by Plaintiff s father

one Ran Naide. The Plaintiff has not disclosed these fact in his plaint. He also

has not disclosed the names of the illegitimate children in his plaint and had

failed to give notice under section 20(1) of the Partition Law. Accordingly, I

hold that the plaint of the Plaint is defective in that the Plaintiff has to indicate

the correct pedigree and whether the land is paraveni property or acquired

property in the plaint.

I am of the view that the Plaintiff has failed to narrate the nature of the property

and to mention whether Ran Ethana was married in deega or binna and whether

Muhandiram had other children who had claims to the land to be partitioned.

14

I hold that the Learned District Judge has failed and that there has been no proper

investigation of title on the part of that Learned District Judge. As such I am of

the view that the Learned District Judge has come to an incorrect conclusion

when he has answered issue No 10 as not proved as he has not considered

document marked P5 in regard to the devolution of title.

The Learned Counsel for the 5th Defendant Appellant in his petition has prayed

for a dismissed of the action. However in the interest of justice I am of the view

that this case has to tried in de novo.

Hence we allow this appeal and to set aside the judgement dated 04/06/1998 with

cost ofRs.25,0001- and order of the Learned District Judge to commence the trial

in de novo with notice the all parties.
