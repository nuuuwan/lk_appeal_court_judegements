Order

Vijith K. MaJaJgoda PC J

Petitioner to the present application Chandana Sri Prasanna Kumara Wellangiriya had come before

this court seeking inter alia,

b) Issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the disciplinary order of the 12th Respondent marked as

P-12

c) Issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the reinstatement letter of the 11th Respondent marked as

P-13

d) Issue a writ of Mandamus compelling and directing the 10th Respondent and/or any other

Respondents to reinstate the Petitioner in the post of Electrical Superintendent Grade II A

with back wages and all other privileges

At the commencement of the arguments before this court the Learned Deputy Solicitor General

representing the Respondents had raised a preliminary objection to the maintainability of the present

application on two grounds, namely suppression of material facts as the 15t ground and secondly

granting of a writ of Mandamus as prayed for or any other relief would be futile.

As observed by this court the Petitioner was attached to the 2nd Respondent Board as a store keeper

and was appointed to the post of Electrical Superintendent Grade II B with effect from 09.08.1995

and was promoted as Grade II A officer of the Electrical Superintendent Service with effect from

09.08.2005.

While the Petitioner was working as the Electrical Superintendent Grade II A attached to Elpitiya

Customer Service Centre, the Special Investigation Unit of the 2nd Respondent Board initiated an

inquiry into some allegations received against the Petitioner.

5

As admitted by both parties, subsequent to the said investigation a charge sheet was issued on the

Petitioner and was interdicted with effect from 31. 01. 2012 pending the said inquiry.

A formal disciplinary inquiry was held against the Petitioner, where several witnesses had given

evidence for the prosecution. The Petitioner opted not to give evidence at the said inquiry but

submitted a written statement at the conclusion of the inquiry.

As submitted by the Petitioner, he was served with a disciplinary order by the 12th Respondent dated

16.01.2013 in which the disciplinary tribunal has found the Petitioner guilty of charges 5,6, 7, 10, 11

and 17 of the charge sheet and the Petitioner was reinstated to a lower grade, i.e. Store Keeper Grade

III, which was the post held by him previously and transferred to a place where there was no

consumer relations.

The Petitioner was subsequently served with a reinstatement latter signed by the 11th Respondent and

according to the said latter which was produced marked P-13 the Petitioner was reinstated subject to

the following conditions;

a) Will be demoted to the post of Store Keeper Grade III

b) Will be placed at the initial salary step of the above post

c) Will be subject to one year probation

d) Interdiction period will be considered as no pay leave

e) Will be transferred from AGM region 4 to AGM region I

The Petitioner who was dissatisfied with the said disciplinary order and the reinstatement order had

made an application for a copy of the inquiry proceedings to lodge an appeal but the 12th Respondent

had refused to issue him with the inquiry proceedings and thereafter he had submitted an appeal to the

3rd Respondent against the said two orders.

6

One main allegation raised before us by the Petitioner is the failure by anyone of the Respondents

referred to above to respond to the appeal preferred by the Petitioner for nearly 3 years, and therefore

the Petitioner had decided to come before this court seeking the relief as referred to above.

As observed above, the Petitioner in his petition had referred to the reinstatement letter received by

him, and being dissatisfied with the said order, appealed against the order but, is silent on the fact

whether he complied with the said order, before complaining against it.

However whilst submitting that the Petitioner is guilty of suppressing material facts before this court,

the Learned Deputy Solicitor General who represented the 2nd Respondent had submitted that, when

the Petitioner was informed to report to work by the letter dated 23.01.2013 (P-13), he did not report

to work as directed in the said letter. Since the Petitioner did not report to work, he was served with a

vacation of post notice and the said notice too had been submitted before this court marked R-4 with

the amended counter objections filed on behalf of the said Respondents.

In the said vacation of post notice, which was sent to the Petitioner by Additional General Manager

Region 1 on 29.05.2013 had referred to the communications between the Petitioner and the

Respondent as follows;

" ~Q) 2013.01.23 ~.!D 80 ,B)O)~ ~Q)) @(5)j Gl~@~6)~ (0)160 @c3oGjo .!D10l~~ 8o.!D

7

However when the Respondents took up the said position in their amended objections, the Petitioner

submitted marked P-19 another communication dated 05.03.2013 from Additional General Manager

Region 1 to the effect,

Even though by submitting the above letter the Petitioner made an attempt for the first time to show

that he send a telegram informing his inability to report to work due to ill health, it is understood

when compared the two letters, that,

a) The Petitioner has not submitted any medical certificate acceptable to the 2nd Respondent

b) Has not reported to work until 29. 05.2013

In the circumstances the Petitioner was considered as vacated his post with effect from 23.01.2013.

As further observed by this court the Petitioner's contention before this court was to challenge the

disciplinary order dated 16.01.2013 and the reinstatement letter dated 23.01.2013 but as observed

above the Petitioner was served with the vacation of post notice on 29.05.2013 operative from

23.01.2013 which has not been challenged by the Petitioner before this court.

As referred to above the Petitioner has sought to quash the above two decisions dated 16.01.2013 and

23.01.2013 and also sought a writ of Mandamus compelling the Respondent to reinstate him in the

post of Electrical Superintendent Grade II A, but he has failed to sought relief to quash the vacation

8

of post notice served on him and therefore the purpose of granting the relief prayed by the Petitioner

will become futile until the said vacation of post notice is in operation.

In the case of Sideek V. Jacolin Senevirathne 1984 1 Sri LR 83 the Supreme Court held that, the

court will have regard to the special circumstances of the case before it, before issuing a writ of

Certiorari. The writ of Certiorari clearly will not issue where the end result will be faulty, frustration,

injustice and illegality.

In the Case of P.S. Bus Company Ltd V. Ceylon Transport Board (1958) 61NLR 491 it was held,

that the prerogative writs are not issued as a matter of cause and it is in the discretion of court to grant

it if the facts and circumstances are such as to warrant a refusal. A writ for instance, will not issue

where it would be vexatious or futile.

The next preliminary objection raised by the Respondent was based on the Petitioner's failure to

place before court material facts or in other words, suppression of material facts.

As revealed above, until the Respondents submitted the vacation of post notice served on the

Petitioner by their amended statement of objection, Petitioner did not divulge the fact that the

Respondents have vacated his post for his failure to comply with the reinstatement order and report to

the new work place under the Additional General Manager Region I. As observed above in this order,

the fact that the Petitioner was served with a vacation of post notice by the Respondent is very

material to the case in hand. If this court proceeded with this case and issued the relief claimed by the

Petitioner, the said issuance would become futile and therefore the failure by the Petitioner to disclose

the fact that he had been served with a vacation of post notice is misleading and therefore it appear

that the said conduct of the Petitioner amounts to suppression of material facts from this court.

In the Land Mark case of Alponso Appuhamy V. L. Hettiarachchi and another 1973 NLR 131

Pathirana J observed that,

9

"The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed before the court when

an application for a writ or injunction is made and the process of the court is invoked is laid down in

the case of The King V. The General Commissioners for the purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the

District of Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmond de Poignac - (1917) Kings Bench Division 486.

Although this case deals with a writ of Prohibition the principles enunciated are applicable to all

cases of writs or injunctions. In this case a Divisional Court without dealing with the merits of the

case discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant had suppressed or misrepresented the facts

material to her application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that

there had been a suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit and therefore it was

justified in refusing a writ of Prohibition without going into the merits of the case. In other words, so

rigorous is the necessity for a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the court would not

go into the merits of the application, but will dismiss it without further examination."

In the case of Mosojees V. Eksath Engineru Saha Samanya Kamkaru Samithya 1979 (2) NLR 285

Supreme Court held,

"It is evident on the material before us that Moosajees Ltd. employed Upasaka Appu to serve as a tool

in their hands to themselves escape liabilities of employment. The pleading in their petition and

affidavit do not contain a full disclosure of the real facts of the case to say the least the Petitioner has

not observed the utmost good faith and has been guilt y of a lack of uberrima fides by a suppression of

material facts in the pleadings."

In the case of Borella Private Hospital V. Bandaranayake and two others 2005 (1) Appellate Law

Recorder 27 Sripawan (J) (as he was then) observed that, the writ of Certiorari and Mandamus being

discretionary remedies will not be granted where the party applying lacks uberrima fides and fails to

disclose material facts to court. As Pathirana J held in the case of Alponso Appuhamy V. Hettiarachi

77 NLR 131, if a party who wanting in uberrrima fides, the Court will not grant him relief." A similar

10

sentiment was expressed by A. De. Z. Gunawardena J in the case of Collettes Ltd., V. Commissioner

of Labour (1989) 2 SLR 6 at 17 where His Lordship stated that "it is essential when a party invokes

the writ jurisdiction or applies for an injunction to this court, all facts must be clearly, fairly and fully

pleaded, so that the court would be made aware of all the relevant matters. It is necessary that this

procedure must be followed by all litigants who come before this court in order to ensure that justice

and fair play would prevail."

Thus, it is seen where there had been suppression of material facts, the Petitioner's application is

liable to be dismissed without going into the merits of the case. Since the Petitioner has failed to

disclose facts material to this application, the court will not in any event and grant and issue the wits

it prayed for."

In the said circumstance, I observed that the Petitioner is guilty of suppressing material facts before

this court and therefore liable to be dismissed without going to the merits of the case.

For the forgoing reasons I uphold the preliminary objections raised by the Learned Deputy Solicitor

General on behalf of the Respondents and therefore dismiss this application but make no order with

regard to cost.

Application dismissed.
