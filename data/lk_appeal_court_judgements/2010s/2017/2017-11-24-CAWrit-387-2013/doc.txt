A

n important question of law that arises in the case can be stated in a nutshell '

who is vested with the jurisdiction to determine the question whether the

forfeiture of gratuity in terms of Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of

1983 (hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Act") has been correctly made in

accordance the Act? Which of the functionaries under the Act is the repository of that

j I I l 1 t

jurisdiction? Is it the Commissioner of Labour or the Labour Tribunal that is the

repository of that jurisdiction?

This is the question that this application for judicial review raises before this Court.

The Petitioner~a freight forwarding company has sought, inter alia, a writ of certiorari

to quash two decisions contained in documents marked P5 and P13 and a writ of

prohibition on the r t and / or 2nd and / or 3rd and / or 4th Respondents restraining

them from inquiring into the application of the 5th Respondent with regard to

gratuity.

The document P5 dated 30.07.2012 orders the employer (the Petitioner in the case) to

pay a sum of Rs. 191,865.30 as gratuity to one Samantha~the workman who had made

a complaint to the Department of Labour against the Petitioner. The document P13

dated 31.10.2013 reiterates the liability of the Petitioner to make this payment but

what distinguishes P13 from PS is that the latter document in point of time namely

P13 cites reasons as to how this liability is imposed. However, the contention of the

learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner Mr. Nigel Hatch before this Court is

twofold. Firstly, since the petitioner~company had employed less than 15 workmen in

the months of August 2011 and May 2011 during the period of 12 months preceding the

termination of the services of the workman Samantha, Section 5 of the Payment of

Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983 would not clothe the Department of Labour with

jurisdiction to inquire into the complaint of the workman in light of the fact that

Section 5 of the Act mandates that there must have been 15 or more workmen

employed on any day during the period of 12 months immediately preceding the

termination of the services of the workmen. His second argument was that without

prejudice to the 1st ground as aforesaid, and in any event, under Section 31B (l)(c) of

the Industrial Disputes Act (as amended), only a Labour Tribunal is vested with

jurisdiction to determine the question whether the forfeiture of gratuity as effected by

the Petitioner in respect of the workman has been correctly made in terms of the

Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983.

3

At this stage it is apposite to allude to the factual matrix surrounding the case in

order to understand the legal arguments in its proper perspective. The 5th Respondent

workman-P.D. Janaka Samantha had been in the employ of the Petitioner freight

forwarding company for nearly 12 years until his services were terminated with effect

from 14.11.2011 by a letter dated 08.02.2012 marked as P2n. He had risen to the

position of Manager (Operations) but a deadlock seems to have developed in 2011

when the 5th Respondent sought to tender his resignation from the company with

effect from 01.12.2011, by his letter dated 31.10.2011 (P2a).

The Director/CEO of the petitioner-company responded to this letter of resignation

by a letter dated 14.11.2011 (P2b) by refusing to accept the resignation of the workman

and chronicled a number of serious lapses on the part of the 5th Respondent which,

the CEO alleged, amounted to a clear violation of the terms and conditions

governingthe workman's contract of services. Some of the acts of misdemeanor that

the letter dated 14.11.2011 complains of are abuse of other employees, loss of revenue,

sabotage of the business interests of the employer, engaging in business with rival

companies, revelation of sensitive information to rival companies etc. The letter

further alleged that the 5th Respondent workman was inducing fellow employees to

cause a breach of their employment contracts by exhorting them to leave the

company along with him.

By a document marked P2( d) of 18.11.2011, the workman was asked to show cause as

to why disciplinary action should not been taken in respect of the allegations which

were morefully described mirroring the same as in the letter that refused to accept his

letter of resignation. The 5th Respondent responded to the show cause by denying the

charges which he called baseless and false. Moreover, he requested in his response to

the show cause that the charges be withdrawn and permission be granted to resign

with no impediment to future prospects-vide P2(f).

The course of correspondence between the employer and workman shows

unmistakably that even as late as 25.11.2011 when the workman denied the charges

4

against him, the permission to resignation that he had sought in his letter dated

31.10.2011 was not granted. It is worthy of note that clause 9 of the contract of

employment (P2) requires either party to serve three calendar months' notice in

writing or the employee has to forfeit three months' salary in lieu of such notice. In

this case, the letter of resignation dated 31.10.2011 (P2a) goes contrary to clause 9 of

contract of employment (P2) as it gives only one month's notice of resignation.

Be that as it may, the petitioner~company took the view that the reasons given in the

responses of the 5th Respondent were not acceptable and communicated to him with

an accompanying charge sheet that the management had decided to hold a domestic

inquiry and by a registered letter dated 06.01.2012 informed him of the appointment

of an inquiry officer and the date and time of the inquiry. The letter elicited a response

from the 5th Respondent dated 11.01.2012 P2(l) wherein he stated that as he had

resigned on 31.10.2011 giving one month's notice, he should be treated as a "resigned

employee" (sic) and the charges must be withdrawn. He also urged that his dues and

gratuity be paid. Even in his response dated 11.01.2012, the 5th Respondent impliedly

concedes that his resignation had not been accepted by the petitioner~company.

It is not in dispute that the domestic inquiry proceeded without the participation of

the workman, albeit he was noticed to appear, and based on the findings of the said

inquiry which found the 5th Respondent guilty of all charges, the petitioner~company

proceeded to terminate the services of the 5th Respondent with effect from 14.11.2011

by a letter dated 08.02.2012~(P2n).

The charge sheet dated 9th December 2011 (P2h) contained 8 charges pertaining to

loss of revenue, insubordination, deliberate dereliction of duty, misappropriation of

funds of the Petitioner, divulging sensitive information relating to the business of the

Petitioner to a competitor, making a secret profit whilst in employment etc. It is

undeniable that the termination on the above grounds had not been challenged in any

tribunal or court at the time this application for judicial review was preferred. It is

5

}II

indubitable that up to now the termination of services remains unchallenged and

unimpugned.

Thus we are faced with a situation where an employee was terminated on some of the

grounds set out in Section 13 of the Actafter a domestic inquiry. It has to be

remembered that the employer~workman relationship had not been severed in terms

of the contact of employment prior to the termination on disciplinary grounds. What

ensued after the termination of services of the 5th Respondent is germane to the

jurisdictional issue that arises in the case.

As the letter of termination P2n bears it out, the termination of services of the 5th

Respondent is premised on misconduct. It also notifies the 5th Respondent that the

Petitioner reserves its right to institute legal action against him to recover any dues

due from him to the company. It would appear that such a situation would attract

Section 13 of the Payment of the Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983 which goes as follows:~

"Any workman, to whom a gratuity is payable under Part II of this Act and, whose services

have been terminated for reasons of fraud, misappropriation of funds of the employer, Wilful

damage to property of the employer, or causing the loss of goods, articles or property of the

employer, shall forfeit such gratuity to the extent of the damage or loss caused by him."

In terms of Section 13, a workman to whom gratuity is payable under Part II will

forfeit his gratuity if his services have been terminated on the disciplinary grounds

specified in the said provision. In fact an employer'S liability to pay gratuity to his

workmen is cast upon him in terms of Section 5(1) of the Act which for purposes of

clarity merits mention.

"Every employer who employs or has employed fifteen or more workmen on any day during the

period of twelve months immediately preceding the termination of the services of a workman

in any industry shalL on termination (whether by the employer or workman, or on retirement

or by the death of the workman, or by operation of law, or otherwise) of the services at any

time after the coming into operation of this Act, of a workman who has a period of service of

6 I; ! I ! I\

not less than five completed years under that employer, pay to that workman in respect of such

services, and where the termination is by the death of that workman, to his heirs, a gratuity

computed in accordance with the provisions of this Part within a period of thirty days of such

termination. "

If Section 5(1) of the Actis truncated into its component parts, an employer's liability

to pay gratuity will be contingent upon the following requisites:

1. The workman must have completed five years or more under the employer;

2. Gratuity is payable upon termination of services brought about by the employer or

employee, retirement, death of the workman or by operation of law or otherwise;

3. The employer has or has employed fifteen or more workmen on any day during the period

of 12 months preceding the termination of services."

The Commissioner of Labour is empowered under Part III of the Act to implement

the payment of gratuity due under the Act and it is to him the workmen have recourse

when any employer who is liable to pay any sum due as gratuity fails or defaults in the

payment. But the liability imposed by Section 5 has an exception which is enacted in

Section 13 of the Act which I have cited above. Notwithstanding the existence of the

requisites as set out in Section 5(1) of the Act, if the services of the workman have

been terminated on disciplinary grounds such as fraud, misappropriation of frauds,

wilful damage of property, or loss of goods, articles or property of the employer, the

right to receive gratuity is forfeited to the extent of the damage or loss as set out in

Section 13 and consequently Section 5(1) liability is taken away. Section 13 forfeiture

is linked to Section 3lB (1)( c) of the Industrial Disputes Act in that the forum is in the

Labour Tribunal to test the correctness of the forfeiture of gratuity. In other words

the jurisdiction to assess the correctness of the forfeiture decision made by the

employer in respect of his gratuity obligation is vested in the Labour Tribunal by

virtue of Section 3lB (1)(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act. So in a nutshell Section 13

of the Payment of Gratuity Act is intrinsically interwoven with Section 3lB (1)(c) as

7

the former permits the employer to visit an errant workman with the sanction of

forfeiture of gratuity, whilst Section 31B (1)( c) of the Industrial Disputes Act bestows

the jurisdiction on a Labour Tribunal to assess the correctness of the decision of the

employer.

By way of another addendum, I must refer to Section 31B(1)(b) of the Industrial

Disputes Act which empowers a Labour Tribunal to award gratuity to a workman

when he has worked in an industry which has employed less than 15 workmen. By

way of contrast, Section 5 of the Payment of Gratuity Act empowers the

Commissioner of Labour to oversee the payment of gratuity to a workman when he

has been employed by an employer who has employed 15 or more workmen. Thus the

underlying metwand is that there are two regimes for payment of gratuity. An

employer who employs in terms of the Act is castupon the liability to pay only if he

has employed 15 workmen or more, whereas the regime under the Industrial Disputes

Act empowers the Labour Tribunal to award gratuity when there are less than 15

employees. An additional jurisdiction given to the Labour Tribunal is that if an

employer who has or has had more than 15 workmen during the period of 1 year

preceding the date of termination of services of a workman has terminated the

services of the workman on grounds of misconduct as set out in Section 13, the

Labour Tribunal is bound to assess the correctness of the decision.

Given that the services of the 5th Respondent were terminated on disciplinary

grounds such as fraud and misappropriation, it would appear that Section 13 of the

Act read with Section 31B (1)( c) of the Industrial Disputes Act would be engaged and

consequently it would be the Labour Tribunal which has to go into the correctness of

the decision to forfeit gratuity. But the gravamen of the contention before this Court

is that by letter dated 19.01.2012 (P3) the 5th Respondent~workman complained to

the Assistant Commissioner of Labour (East). It is before this forum namely the

Assistant Commissioner of Labour that the employer took up the jurisdictional

objection viz~ the correctness of the forfeiture cannot be gone into by the

Commissioner.

Turning to the legislative history I find that when the Payment of Gratuity Act, No.l2

of 1983 was enacted in 1983, it was through Section 17 of this Act, No. 12 of 1983 that

the legislature amended the Industrial Disputes Act giving the Labour Tribunals IQf

this country jurisdiction to go into gratuity having regard to the number of

employees. In 1983, the legislature added the presently worded subsections 31B (1) (b)

and Section 3IB (1)(c) to the Industrial Disputes Act. Those substituted provisions

namely Sections 31B (1)(b) and 31B (1)( c) of the Industrial Disputes Act were added

to the Industrial Disputes Act by Section 17 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of

1983. Both these subsections deal with payment of gratuity. The distinction between

the two sections is that under 31B (1)(b) ~ the workman seeking entitlement to

gratuity must have been employed in an industry which has employed less than

fifteen workmen, whilst subsection 3IB (1)(c) deals with the correctness of

forfeiture of gratuity that has occurred for specific grounds but the industry in this

instance must have employed fifteen or more workmen. This subsection entitles the

Labour Tribunal to assess the correctness of forfeiture of gratuity effected in terms of

Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983. In other words since Section

13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No.l2 of 1983 only applies to an industry where the

employer has or has employed fifteen or more workmen, it goes without saying that

under Section 31B (1)(c) of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Labour Tribunal would

consider the correctness of forfeiture effected in an industry which has employed

fifteen or more workmen within a period of 12 months preceding the date of

termination of services of a workman. It all boils down that the Payment of Gratuity

Act, No. 12 of 1983 applies to an industry that has employed IS or more employees. But

even in such a situation, if there is a forfeiture of gratuity on the grounds set out in

Section 13 of the Act, the correctness of that decision goes before the Labour Tribunal

for a legal appraisal. It is only when there is an industry having IS or more workmen

but there is no allegation of fraud or misappropriation as set out in Section 13, the

Commissioner gets jurisdiction to go into the question of gratuity. Upon a close

scrutiny of the aforesaid provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act, No. 12 of 1983, one

9

is irresistibly drawn to the above legislative scheme and assignment of jurisdiction of

the statutory functionaries namely, the Commissioner of Labour and Labour

Tribunal.

Harking back to the jurisdictional objections of the petitioner-company before the

Commissioner of Labour, this Court points out as stated before that the Petitioner

raised the jurisdictional bar of Section 13 of the Act before this Court. The contention

was that since termination of services of the 5th Respondent was for fraud and if he

had a legitimate grievance, the legality of the forfeiture of gratuity should have been

canvassed in the Labour Tribunal as Section 3IB (l)(c) of the Act vests the

jurisdiction with the Labour Tribunal. Here was an employer who consistently

submitted before the inquiry officer of the Labour Secretariat that there was a Section

13 forfeiture of gratuity.

It would appear that this objection has gone a-begging. The jurisdictional question

does not seem to have been dealt with in the initial order (PS) that the Petitioner

seeks to quash in this application. In Commissioner General of Inland Revenue v.

Koggala Gannents (Pvt) Ltd, (CA Application No. Taxi01/2008 decided on

05.04.2017), this Court cited H.W.R. Wade and c.F. Forsyth, Administrative Law

(Oxford: Oxford University Press, nth ed; 2014) as to the duty of a statutory tribunal

to examine a jurisdictional issue that is raised before it. Both the celebrated authors

state, at p.2IO, as follows:-

"Where a jurisdictional question is disputed before a tribunal, the tribunal must necessarily

decide it. If it refuses to do so, it is wrongfully declining jurisdiction and the court will order it

to act properly. Otherwise the tribunal or other authOrity 'would be able to wield an

absolutely despotiC power, which the legislature never intended that it should exercise. It

follows that the question is within the tribunal's own jurisdiction, but with this difference, that

the tribunal's decision about it cannot be conclusive.'

Thus William Wade and Christopher Forsyth articulate the proposition that a

tribunal is under an obligation to examine the jurisdictional question that has been

10

raised before it. I had occasion to hold in Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

v. Koggala Garments (Pvt) Ltd, (supra) that if the tribunal had got its answer to the

jurisdictional question wrong, it would be open to the aggrieved party to canvass the

wrong answer as a jurisdictional error by way of judicial review but sadly enough,

there is nothing to suggest nor is therea scintilla of evidence that the tribunal ever

addressed itself on the jurisdictional question. No record of proceedings subsequent

to the raising of the jUrisdictional objection before the Commissioner has been placed

before this Court. Instead, this Court finds P5 dated 30.07.2017 where a standard

form used by the Department of Labour has been sent to the Petitioner giving a

breakdown of a sum of Rs.l91,865.30 that must be paid to the workman Samantha

(5th Respondent) by way of gratuity in terms of Section 5 of Payment of Gratuity Act,

No.l2 of 1983.

The aforesaid document marked P5 orders the Petitioner to deposit the aforesaid sum

within 14 days in the name of Assistant Commissioner of Labour at the Labour Office,

Colombo South.

This decision, casting the Petitioner in liability under Section 5 of the Act does not

answer the jurisdictional objection raised, nor does it explain the basis on which the

process of decision making in terms of Section 5 has been carried out.

The culpable omission becomes more pronounced in light of the fact that Section 13 of

the Act was urged as an exception to Section 5 of the Act but the document P5 is

devoid of any answer to the jurisdictional question. At this stage it would suffice to

begin with the beginning of the watershed that brought about a paradigmatic shift

towards giving reasons for administrative decisions in this country. The case of

Karunadasa v. Unique Gemstones limited (1997) 1 Sri.LR 250 is a landmark

decision which bears repetition. This was a case under the Termination of

Employment of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act, No.45 of 1971 where the

Commissioner of Labour failed to convey to the Employer, the reasons for its decision

to reinstate Karundasa. The Employer, Unique Gemstones Limited sought judicial

11

review of the said order under and in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution on the

basis that reasons had not been given by the Commissioner of Labour. The

Commissioner of Labour was absent and unrepresented in the Court of Appeal. In the

judgment of the Court of Appeal, it was held that the Commissioner of Labour ought

to have given reasons. Karunadasa appealed against the said judgment of the Court of

Appeal to the Supreme Court where Justice Mark Fernando held as follows:

"The Court of Appeal did not attempt to lay down an inflexible general principle that Natural

Justice always requires an administrative authority to give reasons, although he did perceive a

trend in that direction. It seems to me that his observations that giving reasons for a decision

is one of the fundamentals of good administration, and is implicit in the requirement of a fair

hearing ~ were made, and must be understood, in the context of the position of the

Commissioner of Labour under the Termination Act."

And whether or not the parties are also entitled to be told the reasons for the decisiOn, if they

are withheld, once judicial review commences, the decision 'may be condemned as arbitrary

and unreasonable'; certainly, the Court cannot be asked to presume that they were valid

reasons, for that would be to surrender its discretion.

The parties do not seem to have realised the need to invite the Court of Appeal to call for and

examine, the record and the recommendation. In the course of the hearing in this Court, Mr.

Kamalasabayson tendered copies of the recommendation made by the 3rd respondent, and

undertook to make the 2nd respondent'S file available whenever required."

In the course of the argument this Court drew the attention of both counsel that this

Court was not furnished with copies of the proceedings or recommendations made by

the inquiry officer before P5 was made and in the absence of any tender of reasons for

P5 this Court is irresistibly drawn to the view that reasons for P5 did not exist.

As would happen, by P6 dated 14.08.2012 the Chairman, MA Lanka (Pvt) Ltd., (the

petitioner-company) preferred an appeal to the Commissioner General of Labour and

pinpointed that despite the production of the report of the inquiry officer who

12

I i II;

~ t ~ ,

conducted the domestic inquiry into the charge sheet and other relevant documents,

no reasons had been given for imposing a Section 5 liability and that they would

require reasons. P5 does not afford any reasons to be given as to why their

jurisdictional objection had been rejected. This document from the Petitioner does

not seem to have provoked a response but by P7 dated 17.10.2012 the Petitioner was

notified to come for an inquiry on 21.11.2012. This invitation reinforces the view that

no reasons existed for P5.

On 21.11.2012, the Petitionerby way of P7(a) reiterated its objection to liability to pay

and though the Department of Labour acknowledged its receipt, there was no

response to P7(a).

Thereafter, the petitioner-company wrote to the Commissioner General of Labour by

its letter dated 03.12.212 giving a concatenation of events surrounding the facts and

circumstances of the case pertaining to workman Samantha and raised the selfsame

two objections that had been put forward previously. This appeal (P8) is in effect a

plea to the Commissioner that P5 is wrong on two grounds namely;

1. The company had less than 15 workmen in the months of August 2011 and May 2011.

2. Without prejudice to the 1st jurisdictional objection, under Section 31B (l)(c) of the

Industrial Disputes Act (as amended) only a Labour Tribunal is with jurisdiction to test

the correctness of forfeiture of gratuity.

It bears repetition that P8 too was not responded to. By a document dated 07.02.2012

(P9), the 2nd Respondent again summoned the Petitioner for a fresh inquiry. Upon a

perusal of the documents and submissions made, this Court finds that the learned

President's Counsel himself had attended this fresh inquiry. It would appear that by a

document marked PlO, another plea that P5 must be withdrawn on legal grounds

was sent to the Commissioner of Labour.

It has to be remembered that P7, P8 and PI0 were in the forms of appeals to which

there were no responses. PI0 also submitted along with it documents for the

13

consideration of the statutory functionary to support the argument that PS was

erroneous and could never have been made.

It appears that the correspondence between the parties had eventually resulted in PH

dated 21.10.2013 that summoned the Petitioner for a fourth inquiry on the jurisdiction

matter. This Court wishes to highlight the need on the part of statutory functionaries

to observe due process in order to dispose of legal objections as expeditiously as

possible and a multiplicity of proceedings towards the resolution of legal issues must

be avoided at all costs as they tend to show indecisiveness and inconclusiveness on

the part of decision makers. What had seemingly gone on between the parties

demonstrates a needless voyage to ceaselessly hold inquiries without reaching an

answer to the jurisdictional questions that were raised for the umpteenth time.

Further by a letter dated 24.03.2013 (P12) addressed to the Commissioner General of

Labour, the petitioner~company reiterated the jurisdictional objections they had

raised in their prior letter dated 03.12.2012.

The Petitioner pointed out in that letter to the Commissioner that they are entitled in

law to a determination on the objections that they had raised. After all this

correspondence that had gone on between the Petitioner and the Commissioner

General of Labour, a document dated 31.10.2013 (P13) has been addressed to the

Petitioner reiterating the same payment obligation of the Petitioner as was

adumbrated in PS dated 30.07.2012 but P13 which the 3rd Respondent dispatched to

the Petitioner virtually one year and three months later than PS is a reiteration of PS

and seeks to give a semblance of an explanation as to why the petitioner~company is

obligated to make a payment of gratuity. The document marked P13 rejects both

preliminary objections of the Petitioner and states further that by the previous

determination dated 30.07.2012 (PS) it has been determined that the 5th Respondent

is entitled to be paid gratuity. It is these two determinations (PS and P13) that are

sought to be impugned by way of certiorari.

14

As I stated before, P5 does not recite any reasons as to why P5 imposes a gratuity

liability when the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Labour to embark upon an

investigation in terms of Section 5 was called in question by the Petitioner on the

ground that it is only forfeiture that the company has effected consequent to the

findings of guilt by a domestic inquiry. The argument of the Petitioner that if a

forfeiture of gratuity fell within Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act, the matter

must stand removed or it must be taken up in the relevant Labour Tribunal by virtue

of subsection 3lB (1)( c) of the Industrial Disputes Act was never answered or

disposed of by the Commissioner.

In fact what is necessary for purposes of the Commissioner of Labour to ascertain

whether he has jurisdiction or not is some kind of evidence whether the services of

the workman have been terminated in terms of Section 13 for reasons of fraud,

misappropriation of funds of the employer, wilful damage to property of the

employer, or causing the loss of goods, articles or property of the employer. If that

evidence is manifest or evident to the Commissioner of Labour upon a facial

examination of available documents, it is at this stage that the Commissioner of

Labour would lose seisin of the matter. Merely because an employer states before the

Commissioner that he has effected a Section 13 forfeiture when an employee has

complained against non-payment of gratuity, it doesn't automatically follow that the

Commissioner should stay his hand. It is open to the Commissioner to ascertain the

genuineness of the claim of the employer that he has in fact effected a forfeiture for

the reasons set out in Section 13 of the Payment of Gratuity Act. To the limited extent of

ascertaining whether there is in effect a forfeiture on account of the grounds set out in Section 13, the

Commissioner can take into accountof thefact of a domestic inquiry that had taken place, before the

employer proceeded to impose a forfeiture. The existence of findings of guilt would also establish that

there is foundation for the claim of the employer that he has imposed a forfeiture on account of Section

13 of the Act. In other words the Commissioner goes so far as to investigate whether the claim of the

15

employer that he has made a Section 13 forfeiture is true or not. The Commissioner of Labour would

venture no far afield if the claim of the Petitioner factually exists.

In fact as Sriskandaraja J. (as he then was) pointed out quite pertinently in A. Baur &

Company limited v. The Commissioner of Labour and Others (C.A. Writ

Application No. 1033/2005 decided on 16.02.2009), whether the employer has invoked

Section 13 correctly or erroneously, or whether he is entitled to invoke Section 13 or is

disentitled to do so on the facts of the case, or whether the ingredients of Section 13

have been satisfied or not are all matters which go to determining "the question

whether the forfeiture of gratuity has been correctly made" in terms of the Payment of

Gratuity Act. This interpretation takes away the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to

question the very decision that the employer has taken in terms of Section 13 on any

ground whatsoever and the moment it is apparent to the Commissioner that there

exists a forfeiture decision, the forum shifts to the Labour Tribunal to appraise its

correctness. It is the right of the workman to invoke the jurisdiction under Section

31B (1)( c) of the Industrial Disputes Act.

If a forfeiture of gratuity is well evident, then Section 13 situation is patently apparent

and the correctness of forfeiture has to be challenged and impugned in the labour

tribunal. Here is an employer in this case who put before the Commissioner evidence

of the existence of a prior domestic inquiry and a consequent finding of guilt to

establish a Section 13 scenario but notwithstanding such a factual matrix, the

Commissioner went ahead with an inquiry that resulted in PS. In my view despite the

existence of a forfeiture in situ, the Commissioner could not have proceeded with an

inquiry to determine gratuity liability as that jUrisdiction lay by a legislative

assignment of powers to the Labour Tribunal. Thus the inquiry officer of labour

secretariat usurped a jurisdiction that he did not possess. Thus the want of

jurisdiction on the part of the inquiry officer taints the making of P5 and P5 is

consequently liable to be quashed for illegality.

As I pOinted out, the document marked P5 does not afford any reasons for the vires or

competency of the inquiry that the labour office embarked upon. No doubt in R v.

Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Doody 1994 1 AC 531 Lord

Mustill expressed the view that there was no general duty to give reasons in English

law. He did however strongly suggest that the giving of reasons was desirable. His

Lordship observed that the law does not at present recognize a general duty to give

reasons for an administrative decision. His Lordship pointed out though that it was

equally beyond question that such a decision may in appropriate circumstances be

implied. Indeed, according to J. Auburn, J. Moffett and A. Sharland " .... there is a clear trend

towards requiring public bodies to give reasons for their decisions" (Judicial Review

(Oxford University Press, 2013), p.248). That would render procedural impropriety

become applicable as a ground for impugning P5 as P5 is deafeningly silent on the

reasons for the decision.

In the same way P13 which is a reiteration of P5 is susceptible to impugnation. P13

rejects both the preliminary objections raised by the Petitioner. On the pivotal

question of forfeiture and as to where the jurisdiction to test its correctness lies, P13

assumes a jurisdiction that it does not have and on the above reasoning adopted, we

reiterate our view that it is the Labour Tribunal that enjoys the jurisdiction to assess

the correctness of the forfeiture of gratuity and in the circumstances we proceed to

issue orders in the nature of writs of certiorari to quash P5 and P13.

The Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner invited this Court to review the

correctness of the decision of A. Baur & Company limited v. The Commissioner of

Labour and Others [C.A. Writ Application No.l033/2005 decided by Sriskandaraja J.

(as he then was) on16.02.2009] on the aspect of its holding thatif a resignation of a

workman was accepted subject to the condition that he must face a domestic inquiry,

there would be no termination. In such a situation the learned Judge proceeded to

hold that the acceptance of resignation subject to an imminent inquiry would not

amount to a termination.

We are not confronted in this case with a situation of a conditional acceptance of

resignation as we find in A. Baur & Company limited v. The Commissioner of

Labour and Others (C.A. Writ Application No 1033/2005). In A. Baur& Company

limited v. The Commissioner of Labour and Others, there was a conditional

acceptance of the resignation of the workman on the basis that she had to undergo

the rigours of a domestic inquiry. The holding in that case that in such a situation

there was no termination has to be tested in a case which throws up the same facts in

the future namely a workman's resignation is accepted but subject to the condition

that she faces an inquiry. Such is not the case before us. Here is a workman who

sought to resign but his resignation was not accepted at all. Rather his services were

terminated after a domestic inquiry and thereafter a Section 13 forfeiture was made.

In the circumstances this Court proceeds to quash documents namely P5 dated

30.07.2012 and P13 dated 31.10.2013 by way of writs of certiorari and since we have

held that the correctness of forfeiture has to be tested in the Labour Tribunal we also

proceed to issue a writ of prohibition restraining the 1st and / or 2nd and / or 3rd and /

or 4th Respondents from inquiring into the application of the 5th Respondent with

regard to gratuity.
