The Petitioner-Appellant has filed this appeal to set aside the order

dated 616/2012 of the Learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge of

Anuradhapura on or about on 8/5/2012. The Learned Civil Appellate High

Court Judge had issued an ex-parte interim order in terms ofparagraph (iii)

of the prayer of the petition dated 3/5/2012 until the final hearing and

determination of this application and whereas the 1 st to 5th Respondents

move to raise the following preliminary objections as regards to the

jurisdiction of this court to hear and determine this application and the

maintainability of this application, and vacation of the interim order and

the dismissal of this application on same.

It was the position of the 5th and 6th Respondents-Respondents that in

view of the provisions of Article 154P (4) (b) of the Constitution this court

has no jurisdiction to hear and determine this application in as much as the

powers of the pt and 6th Respondents to dissolve the North Central

Provincial Council emanate from Article 154B (8)(c) and (d) of the

Constitution and not from any law or any statute made by the Provincial

Council, in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council list and

therefore the Petitioner's application is liable to be dismissed in limine.

The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of "The Civil Appellate High

Court of the North Central Province" , which has no jurisdiction to issue

orders in the nature of writs of prohibition or Certiorari, Procedendo,

Mandamus and Quo Warranto and therefore the Petitioner's application is

liable to be dismissed in limine.

The member of the North Central Provincial Council elected to same at

the election held on 23/08/2008, other than the 1 st to 5th Respondents who

are affected by the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner and therefore are

necessary parties to this application and therefore the Petitioner's

applications liable to be dismissed in limine.

When this matter came up for hearing on 6/2/2017 the Petitioner was

absent and unrepresented. The Respondent was represented by counsel.

The Respondent's Counsel agreed to dispose this case by way of written

submissions and accordingly written submissions had been tendered to

court on 1612/2017, Judgment was due on 41512017 and was postponed to

26/5/2017.

On a perusal of the written submissions tendered to court,we find that

the Respondents has taken up several preliminary objections regarding the

maintainability of this action. They are as follows;

I

\

f t i I

I l , ! j

(1) In view of the provisions of Article 154P (4) (b) of the

Constitution, the Civil Appellate High Court does not

have the jurisdiction to hear and determine this

application since the power to dissolve the Provincial

Council given to the 1 st and 6th Respondents emanate

from Article 154 B (8) (c) and (d) of the Constitution and

not from 'any law or statute' of the Provincial Council as

set out in the Provincial Council list;

(2) The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction ofthe 'Civil

Appellate High Court of the North Central Province',

which does not have any jurisdiction to issue writs; and

(3) The other members of the North Central Province,

other than the 1 st to 5th Respondents, who were elected

on 23.8.2008 have not been named as Respondents.

In addition to the preliminary objections the Respondents filed

objections stating that the petition sought to curtail the powers vested in

the 1 st and 6th Respondents by the Constitution and the Civil Appellate

High Court does not have the jurisdiction to grant such relief, and further

that when the substantial relief cannot be granted, interim relief too cannot

be granted.

The Learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge also quoted the

provisions of article 154F (2) which states that the discretion exercised by

the Governor shall not be questioned by any court, if there is a question

whether the Governor was empowered to exercise such discretion or not.

Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, it is clear by a mere perusal of

the Article 154B (8) that the 1st and the 6th Respondent have the power to

dissolve the Provincial Council and therefore, a writ of prohibition cannot

be issued as correctly held by the Learned Judge of the High Court.

In Maithripala Senananyake Vs. J.D. Mahindasoma 1998(2) SLR

333 that the Governor, upon the advice of the Chief Minister, can dissolve

the Provincial Council in accordance with article 154B (8) (d). The Civil

Appellate High Court ofthe Provinces cannot issue writs in the exercise of

power by a person outside the province. Article 154P stipulates that the

High Court of the Provinces can issue writs against any person exercising

power within the province under any law or any statute made by any

Provincial Council.

The power to dissolve the Provincial Council has been given by Article

154B (8) (b) and (d). It was submitted that these are powers not confined

to the Province but are enshrined in the Constitution itself and therefore,

this matter cannot be canvassed in the High Court of the Province. It was

further submitted that the High Court of the Provinces cannot issue writs

in matters that do not fall within the Provincial Council list as has been

held in the cases of Weregama V s. Eksath Lanka Plantation Workers

Union 1994 (1) SLR 293 and Nimalaratne Vs. Commissioner of

Agrarian Services 2000 (3) SLR 184.

Accordingly it was submitted that the prayer of the Petitioner could not

in any event be granted. The elections were held and the meeting of the

council was held on 18/9/2008 as per the provisions of Article 154E, the

Provincial Council unless dissolved sooner, shall continue for 5 years.

Even if the North Central Provincial Council was not dissolved prior to the

completion of the term, the term would have come to an end on

17/09/2013.The Respondents also have changed and are no longer holding

office. Therefore, it was contended that this matter is futile.

In the case of P.S. Bus Company Vs. Ceylon Transport Board 61

NLR 491 it was held that a writ will not issue if it is futile.

The Petitioner's other grounds of appeal was that the Civil Appellate

High Court holding that the 1 st Respondent is not a Public Officer is an

error of law. The Respondents respectfully submit that what is stated in the

order is that a prohibition will generally issue to prevent a Public Officer

from taking a wrong decision but that in this present application, the advice

given by the Chief Minister to the Governor to dissolve the Provincial

Council cannot be interpreted as a wrong decision of a 'Public Officer' .

It was submitted that there is no legal basis for the Learned Judge ofthe

Civil Appellate High Court to have stated that the Petitioner is not entitled

to a writ since there is no statute passed within the Province. It is clear from

the order that this is not what has been stated and that article 154P states

that writs can be issued if only the power is exercised within the province.

It was submitted that the Learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge has

decided on these matters and has not given the Petitioner a chance to object

to the decisions. The Respondents submits that issues were argued at length

and ample opportunity given to present the case. It was submitted that the

Learned Civil Appellate High Court has correctly analyzed the law and the

order does not have to be confirmed to the submissions made wherein the

law concerned.

It was submitted that since Article 154B (8) (b) and (d) bestowed the

power on the 1 st and 6th Respondents to dissolve the Provincial Council the

petition must fail. The powers emanate from the Constitution and not from

the Provincial Council List and therefore Article 154P precludes writs

~-

being issued by the High Court of the Province. Finally it was submitted

there since the matter was futile and Respondents no longer holding office

and further, the terms of the Provincial Council would in any event have

come to an end on 17/9/2013. That the Petition of the Petitioner be

dismissed and the order of the Learned Judge of the Civil Appellate High

Court dated 6/6/2012 be upheld.

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Article 154B (8) (c) and (d) is

as follows;

154B (8) (c) "The Governor may dissolve the Provincial Council

(d) The Governor shall exercise his powers under this paragraph

in accordance with the advice of the Chief Minister, so long

as the Board of Ministers commands, in the opinion of the

Governor, the support of the majority of the Provincial

Council./I

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Article 154F (2) is as follows;

154F (2) "If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter

as respects which the Governor is by or under this Constitution

required to act in his discretion, the decision of the Governor in

his discretion shall be final, and the validity of anything done

11

by the Governor shall not be called in question in any court on

the ground that he ought or ought not have acted on his

discretion. The exercise of the Governorl s discretion shall be on

the President1s directions."

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Article 154B (8) is as follows;

154B (8)

(a) "The Governor maYI from time to timel summon the Provincial

Council to meet at such time and place as he thinks fit, but two

months shall not intervene between the last sitting in one session

and the date appointed for the first sitting in the next session.

(b) The Governor may, from time to time, prorogue the Provincial

Council.

(c) The Governor may dissolve the Provincial Council

(d) The Governor shall exercise his powers under this paragraph in

accordance with the advice of the Chief Minister, so long as the

Board of Ministers commands, in the opinion of the Governor, the

support of the majority of the Provincial Council."

Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Article 154P (4) (b) is as

follows;

1I , t {

12

154P (4) (b) order in the nature of writs of certiorari, prohibition,

procedendo, mandamus and quo warranto against any

person exercising, within the Province any power under-

(i) any law; or

(ii) any statutes made by the Provincial Council

established for that Province,

On consideration of the above said preliminary objections and

submissions before court we are of the view that according to the

provisions of Article 154P (4) (b) of the Constitution that the Civil

Appellate High court has no jurisdiction to hear and determine this

application and thus this Petitioner's application is liable to be dismiss in

limine.

i

\

The member of the North Central Provincial Council elected to same f

at the election held on 23/08/2008, other than the 1 st to 5th Respondents

who are affected by the reliefs prayed for by the Petitioner and therefore

we are of the view that they are necessary parties to this application and I 1 ! therefore we are of the view that the Petitioner's applications should be I

dismissed in limine.

The Learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge stated that the provisions

of Article 154F (2) which states that the discretion exercised by the

Governor shall not be questioned by any court, if there is a question

whether the Governor was empowered to exercise such discretion or not.

Hence a mere perusal of the Article 154B (8) that the 1st and the 6th

Respondent have the power to dissolve the Provincial Council and

therefore, a writ of prohibition cannot be issued as correctly held by the

Learned Judge of the Civil Appellate High Court. Further the Civil

Appellate High Court of the provinces cannot issue writs in matters that do

not fall within the Provincial Council list. When the contended matter is

futile a writ will not issue. It is also stated that in the order it is stated that

a prohibition will generally issue to prevent a Public Officer from taking a

wrong decision. However in the present application, the advice given by

the Chief Minister to the Governor to dissolve the Provincial Council

cannot be interpreted as a wrong decision of a 'Public Officer'.

The Petitioner is not entitled to a writ since there is no statute within the

Province. Writs can be issued if only the power is exercised within the

province. It was contended that the Learned Civil Appellate High Court

Judge has decided on these matters and has not given the Petitioner a , !

chance to object to the decisions. We are of the view that issues has been !

[ I argued at length and ample opportunity has been given in the present case.

14

Article 154B (8) (b) and (d) empowered the pt and 6th Respondents to

dissolve the Provincial Council, therefore we are of the view the petition

must fail. We are of the view the matter is futile and the term of the

Provincial Council would in any event have come to an end on 17/9/2013

and that this case is futile.

Hence the petition of the Petitioner is dismissed and the order of the

Learned Civil Appellate High Court Judge dated 6/612012 be upheld.

Accordingly we dismiss this appeal with costs ofRs.10,000/-.
