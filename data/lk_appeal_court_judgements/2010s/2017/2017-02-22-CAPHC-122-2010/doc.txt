H. C. J. Madawala, J

When this matter came up for argument on 13/09/2016 the counsel for the 1 st

to 6th Respondents raised a preliminary objections to the effect that the Revision

Application No. CA(PHC) Rev. Appl. No. 63/2002 pertaining to the instant

dispute between the parties has already been decided by this court by judgment

dated 07/06/2004 and therefore the current appeal cannot be maintained. Both

parties tendered their written submissions respectively on the preliminary

objections. The counsel for the substituted Second party Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant submitted that the Kosgama Police on behalf of the First

Party Respondent-Respondent filed a 66 application under the Primary Court

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, before the Hon. Magistrate Awissawella, in case

No. 29808.

In this case Police stated that the T.L. Wimala Athapattu made a complaint on

or about 29/5/2001, against the deceased Second Party Respondent with regard

to a dispute about a road way. After the parties tendered their pleadings, the

Hon. Magistrate disregarding the objections raised by the Substituted Second

Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant for a scene visit, visited the corpus and

made an order dated 29/10/2001, based on the said scene visit, in favor of the

First Party Respondent-Respondent-Respondents.

\

Being aggrieved by the said order, deceased Second Party Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant preferred an application for Revision to the Provincial

High Court in Awissawella, in case No. 54/2001.

The Learned High Court Judge dismissed the said application. Being aggrieved

with the said judgment, deceased Second Party Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant made an application by way of Revision, in case No. 63/2002, and

also preferred an appeal bearing No. CA(PHC) 122/2002. The said Revision

Application was decided by this court on the urged grounds on 07/06/2004.

Attention of this court was drawn to the following journal entries contained in

the Appeal Brief. The journal entry dated 12107/2001, when the scene visit was

requested for the 1st time, the Second Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

objected and the objection was recorded. On 13/08/2001 despite the objection

raised by the Second Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant for a scene visit,

the Learned Magistrate decided to go ahead with the scene visit. On 17/09/2001

at the time of the scene visit, the Second Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant

objected for the 3rd time, but the Learned Magistrate proceeded with the scene

visit. It was contended that it is quite evident, that the said scene visit was

8

carried out disregarding the objections and without having the consent of all

parties.

Attention of court was drawn to the order of the Learned Magistrate dated

29/10/2001 the said order at page 5, disregarding the previous judgment given

by the competent court in 18785IL, the Learned Magistrate granted a roadway

based on the observations made by him, at the scene visit, which was duly

objected.

The Learned Magistrate came to a conclusion based on the said scene visit

again at page 8 and at page 9 of the said order, on two occasions the Learned

Magistrate came to conclusion solely based on the said scene visit. Therefore

it was contended that the Learned Magistrate more or less completely based his

order, on the said scene visit. It was submitted on the perusal of the High Court

Judgment dated 23/05/2002 it reveals that the High Court too failed to consider

the legality of an order based on observations made at a scene visit though the

scene visit was done ex-parte and disregarding the objections for it.

It was submitted that the Court of Appeal too in CA(PHC) Revision

Application No. 63/2002 did not consider the above aspect at all. Therefore it

cannot be contended that the CA(PHC) Revision Application No 63/2002 has

9

been decided on all the merits. It was submitted that in a 66 application can the

Primary Court Judge carry out an inspection disregarding the objections and

without having the consent of all parties, has not been decided in the aforesaid

Revision Application and it is yet to be decided by this Court.

It was submitted that the non-consideration of the legality of the Learned

Magistrate's order, in the given circumstances as explained earlier caused an

irreparable and lor patent injustice to the Second Party Respondent-Petitioner-

Appellant. Hence it was urged that the said Preliminary objection be rejected

and the matter be fixed for argument.

The counsel for the Respondents submitted that the Revision Application

preferred before this court, which had the effect of dismissing the said action

filed by the Appellants of the present case, was a judgment having considered

the merits of the case there by an order that considered the merits of the present

case and resulted in a dismissal, therefore the present appeal should also stand

dismissed following the determination as judicially decreed in the case of

Robert Silva Vs. Goonawardena and another 1991 (2) SLR 53.

The High Court made order against the reVISIon application preferred

subsequently to the order of the Learned Magistrate by affirming the order of

\

the Learned Magistrate. It was submitted that this having addressed the issue

in relation to Res Judicata further proceeded to address their minds to the main

matter in issue being the findings of the Learned Magistrate and whether or not

their Lordships ought to interfere with the same, which exactly the same

question before where the Lordships court in the present appeal. Having

analyzed the same their Lordships in the said revisions application decreed in

the following manner:

"beside, this is a matter where the Learned Primary Court Judge

on the Police information filed in his court after inquiry had visited

the site for inspection and the original order which subject to revision

has been made consequent to such inspection by the Learned Primary

Court Judge. On inspection the Learned Primary Court Judge would

have observed the ground situation existing at the site. There is

undisputedly greater possibility for ascertainment of realities by such

inspection and where the Learned Primary Court Judge makes a

determination in such a situation this court is slow to reverse that

decision unless patent injustice had been caused to a party. "

They also addressed their minds to the question whether, their Lordships had

to interfere with the findings of the Learned Magistrate which is in fact of

meritorious value. It was also decided in Robert Silva Vs. Goonewardena and

Another 1991 (2) SLR 53 which decrees thus:

tJl

~

! I

t !

"Where an Appellant had made an application for Revision in

respect of the same order he has appealed from and the Revision

Application had been considered on its merits, and dismissed, the

appeal cannot be maintained. "

11

Accordingly it was submitted that the Appellants of the present appeal would

be estopped from maintaining the same on the basis that, the revision

application preferred to this court pending the present appeal was dismissed

having resorted to the merits of the present case.

We have considered the submissions of both parties. The Revision Application

No CA(PHC) Rev. Appl. No 63/2002 pertaining to the instant dispute between

the parties has already been decided by this court on 07/06/2004 having

resorted to the merits in the present case. However it was the contention of the

counsel for the 1 to 6th Respondents that the present appeal cannot be

maintained although in the said Revision application the Hon. High Court

Judge has not considered that the Magistrate has disregarded the objections

raised by the substituted Second Party Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant for a

scene visit and has visited the corpus and made an order dated 29/1 0/200 1,

based on the said scene visit, in favor of the First Party Respondent-

Respondent-Respondents.

\

I 12

On a perusal of the revision application No. CA(PHC) Rev. Appl. No. 63/2002

that the Learned High Court Judge has decided the case on the merits on the

instant appeal. Weare of the view that the Appellant cannot now in his appeal

that is preferred to this court be able to consider the merits and decide on the

facts whether the Primary Court Judge who carry out the inspection

disregarding the objections and without having the consent of all parties can be

decided in this appeal. This facts should have been decided in the revision

application and cannot be tried on a piecemeal basis in the appeal that has been

preferred to this court.

The fact that the Learned Magistrate and the Learned High Court Judge has not

considered the legality of the Magistrate's order. The Second Party

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant had the opportunity to make his objections in

the revision application. The Learned Court of Appeal Judges has not

considered same cannot be accepted as the Appellant is raising a new objection

which he has not raised in the revision application. The Appellants cannot now

by way of appeal consider those facts, once again in the present appeal

preferred to this court.

13

The Appellants in the present appeal is estopped as in the revision application

the merits of this case has already been considered. The order of the revision

application is final and conclusive of all facts in this case.

Accordingly we uphold the preliminary objection and hold that the present

appeal cannot be maintained as the revision application had been decided on

the merits of this case.

Accordingly we dismiss this appeal with cost ofRs.10,OOOI-.
