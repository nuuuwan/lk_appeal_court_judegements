Counsel for the Accused-Appellant submits following grounds of appeal:-

1. The learned trial Judge had perused the investigation notes and

depended on the said investigation notes too.

2. The serious contradiction in the contradiction per-se and inter-se

with the prosecution witnesses was not considered by the learned

Trial Judge.

evaluated by the Trial Judge.

for the prosecution. The Accused-Appellant had made a dock statement and

closed his case.

As per the prosecution this is a case of detection of 5.3 grams of heroin in

the possession of the accused-appellant at Sedawatte.

The prosecution witness S.1. Peduru Arachchi attached to the Police Station

of Grandpass is the only witness who gave evidence. According to him on

the 15th of May 2002 on receiving information and proceeded to Sedawatte,

in his police area together with four officers in a private vehicle. They

stopped the vehicle 50 meters away from the place where they cited the

Accused-Appellant when they got down from the vehicle the accused-

appellant and another person started running from the place, followed them

and gave a chase and apprehended the Accused-Appellant and the other

person who was there had fled away and mingled with the crowd.

According to the witness he had seen the accused was running with a black

colour (tulip bag in his hand). On arrest they found the bag had eleven pink

colour cellophane bag. In that eleven bag they had found 200 packets

wrapped in foil sheets. The witness categorically says that he had captured

heroin from the accused but he has not described how he came to the

conclusion that the substance was heroin. He, on the way, had arrested

another person who possessed 500 milligram of heroin and brought to the

police station. The prosecution witness initially says that he collected

contents of all packets into a white sheets and sealed it at the police station

of Grandpass. Thereafter, it was taken to (Letchami Jewellers) and weighed

it and the witness claims it was nine grams. The substance was sent to the

Government Analyst and it weighed 13.42 grams with the envelope. When

emptied the net powder weight was 9 grams. When that powder was

subjected to a laboratory test it was found 5.3 grams of diacetyle morphine

known as heroin.

At another place the prosecution witness says the substance was emptied at

the jewellery shop weighed and sealed at that place.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundera maintaining

the highest tradition of the Attorney General Department and submits that

there is a serious discrepancy in the weight as well as the place of sealing

the production.

Considering the facts the difference in weight and the place of sealing

creates a reasonable doubt in the case of the prosecution, granting the

benefit of the doubt, we find that the prosecution has not proved the case

beyond reasonable doubt.

Since we have decided in favour of the accused-appellant on the above

ground it is not necessary to arrive at decision on the other grounds of

appeal.

Considering all circumstances, we find that the prosecution has not proved

the case beyond reasonable doubt. Therefore, we allow the appeal and

acquit the accused-appellant.

Appeal allowed.
