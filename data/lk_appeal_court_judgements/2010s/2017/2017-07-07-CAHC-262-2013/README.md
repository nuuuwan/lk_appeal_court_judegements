K. K. WICKRAMASINGHE, J.

The accused appellant (hear in after referred to as the accused) in this case was indicted in the

High Court of Colombo on the charge for having possession of 2.4 grams of diacetylmorphine

[heroin] on or about 11th August 2004 and committed an offence punishable under section 54 A

(c) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Amendment) Act NO.13 of 1984.

After trial the learned high court Judge found the accused appellant guilty of the charge against

him and imposed the death sentence.

Being aggrieved by the said judgement and the sentence the appellant has come before this

court to bring down the sentence.

The learned counsel for the appellant does not wish to challenge the conviction and made

submissions only with regard to bringing down the sentence imposed by the learned High Court

Judge.

Facts of the case:-

According to Prosecution witnesses, after receiving information from a private informant that a

person who was trafficking heroin was coming towards Serpentine Road from Sinna Dupatha,

Borella had proceeded to arrest the suspect. At the time of arrest the appellant was in

possession of 2.4.grams of heroin.

According to the relevant schedule of the Act, the Learned High Court Judge had the option of

either imposing death penalty or life imprisonment.

As submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant, the appellant was a 24 year old at the

time of arrest and he is a drug addict.

The Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that he has three previous convictions for

possession of stolen goods, House breaking by night and theft, possession of 50 m. grams of

heroin. Whereas the learned counsel for the appellant admitted all three previous convictions.

The appellant in the allocutus has made an unqualified admission that he did purchase heroin

in this instance. Also mentioned that he committed theft in order to consume heroin and that

he is addicted to heroin.

It is important to consider the judgement of Periyambalam Vs Queen [74 NLR 515] where it

was held that what the accused person states in the a"ocutus is admissible in appeal. The

learned counsel for the appellant was unable to submit a valid argument to justify why the

death penalty should not be imposed on the accused.

This court is of the view that the appellant was possessing pure heroin of 2.4 grams is not a user

quantity. If the appellant was a first time offender without any previous convictions, the

Learned High Court Judge would have considered a lenient sentence. It is pertinent to note that

the appellant has three previous convictions for finger printable offences. Therefore the

appellant is a threat to the society.

Therefore, this court is of the view that the learned trial judge had come to the correct

finding.

Considering above, we see no reason to interfere with the finding of the learned high

court judge. Hence the conviction and the sentence affirmed.

Appeal is hereby dismissed.
