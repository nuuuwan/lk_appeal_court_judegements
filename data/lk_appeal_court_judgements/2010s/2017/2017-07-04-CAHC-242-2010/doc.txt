The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo

under section 19 (b) and 19 (3) of the Bribery Act on six charges. After

trial he was convicted on all the charges but sentenced on the first, third

and the fifth charges.

On the day in question the lorry hired by the complainant Ran

Banda which was carrying fire wood was alleged to have been stopped

by the appellant and demanded Rs. 75,0001= to release the lorry and the

fire wood. The evidence shows the fire wood belonged to the Hope Estate

and the Superintendent of the Estate has given evidence to say that Ran

Banda had a letter of authority to transport fire wood within the Estate.

The grounds of appeal urged by the appellant are that the learned

High Court Judge failed to address his mind to the infirmities in the case

for the prosecution and that he failed to apply the test of probability.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued that if there was a

permit to transport fire wood within the Estate it is highly improbable for

the complainant to pay a sum of Rs. 75,0001= to the appellant. The

explanation given by the complainant Ran Banda was that he had hired

13 people from the Estate to unload the lorry and that the lorry belonged

to a third party and in order to prevent them being prosecuted he

negotiated and brought down the money to Rs. 60,0001= and paid Rs.

10,0001= from his income in the shop and the balance Rs. 50,0001= was

paid after his wife withdrew the same from the post office savings

account. Hiring 13 people to load and unload a lorry of fire wood is highly

improbable. More over if Ran Banda had a valid permit he had no reason

to panic when the detection was made and further he had ample time to

inform the Superintendent who issued the letter to transport fire wood.

The counsel for the appellant argued that the learned High Court

Judge has not considered the contradiction inter se and drew the

attention of court to the evidence of prosecution witness number 5

Wickremasinghe and prosecution witness number 3 Koin Manika, where

she has stated she went to the post office to withdraw the money from

her savings account at 12.30 whereas Wickremasinghe who was

maintaining accounts at Hadawalapitiya Sub Post Office has stated the

money was withdrawn at 1.00 p.m. This is only a trivial contradiction, as

it is only a difference of 30 minutes.

On perusal of evidence of witness number 8 S.1. Wickremasinghe

the appellant has reported to work on 30/11/2015 at 6.58 and he has

been on duty till 19.05. He has further stated in his evidence that the

police party lead by him has left the police station al 11.50 and has made

the return entry at 18.10. This evidence is elicited from a witness of the

prosecution and he has produced documentary evidence to prove his

evidence. He has also testified that the place where the detection was

made is 15 kilometers away from the police station. Under cross

examination he has stated it takes about one hour to get there from the

police station considering the state of the road. When we consider the

evidence of S.1. Wickremasinghe it is highly improbable for the appellant

to be present at the place of detection.

The accused appellant giving evidence has stated that he reported

to work at 7.00 in the morning and left the police station at 11.50 along

with a police party lead by 5.1. Wickremasinghe, and has reported to the

police station at 19.05. The position taken by the appellant was

corroborated by 5.1. Wickremasinghe's evidence.

In Bandaranayake vs Jagathsena and others 1984 2 SLR 397 it

was held;

"when versions 0/ two witnesses do not agree the trial judge

has to consider whether the discrepancy is due to

dishonesty or to defective memory or whether the witness

power 0/ observation were limited. The demeanor 0/ the

witness in the witness box must be taken into account."

My considered view is that the learned High Court Judge has not

followed this legal principle.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to set aside the judgment

dated 1 0111/201 0 and acquit the appellant appeal is allowed.
