The Accused Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted in the High Court of Badulla for the offence of murder for causing the

death of Herath Mudiyanselage Nilanthi Malini Herath on or about 25.09.1995.

The prosecution led the evidence of Sinnamuttu Devendran (PWl), A.M.

Premadasa (PW2), R. Pathmanadam (PW3), H.M. Guneratne (PW5), Dr.

Mahinda Wijesekara (PW7), IP Somapala Wanasinghe (PW9), PS 17343

Samarasinghe (PWIO) and closed its case. The defence was by way of a Dock

Statement made by the Appellant.

The learned High Court Judge by his judgment dated 01.10.2014 convicted the

accused on the charge of murder and sentenced him to death.

3

The case for the Prosecution in brief was that the deceased was a 19 year old

girl who was married to the Appellant. The deceased was only 16 years old

when she married the Appellant and they have one child from the marriage.

Their matrimonial home was situated in a remote location and the Estate

Hospital was the closest in proximity to their home. It was contended by the

prosecution that the Appellant had severely assaulted the deceased and further

withheld medical attention from her, which ultimately lead to her death. This

proposition was based on circumstantial evidence as there is no eye witness to

the alleged incident.

PW 1, who was the dispenser attached to the dispensary at the Estate Hospital

testified that the Appellant had come to him and asked for medicine for his wife

who was supposedly ailing from a headache and wounds on her legs. PW1 had

issued some medication (Paracetemol and Amoxycilin) on the understanding

that the Appellant would show her to the Doctor subsequently. Thereafter, PW1

had met the Appellant at the bus stand who had informed PW 1 that the

medicine he prescribed earlier had helped his wife and therefore requested for

medicine. PWI had acceded to the request and accompanied the Appellant to

the pharmacy and issued medication. After about 3 - 4 days the Police had

come and recorded a statement from PWl, informing him that the Appellant's

wife had died.

PW 5 ,vv'ho was the father of the deceased testified that the marriage between

the Appellant and the deceased was not a happy one with constant quarrels. One

day he had visited the deceased to find her locked up in a room. PW5 had then

taken her to the hospital. In his evidence, PW5 states that the Appellant had

thereafter come to the hospital and taken her back home. His testimony reveals

4

that the deceased was constantly subject to abuse by the Appellant and that

Police complaints were made in this regard.

PW2 gave evidence that he lived about 1;4 km away from the Appellant's house

and that on the night in question the Appellant had sought his assistance to

transport his wife to the Hospital as she was unconscious. PW2 had taken the

deceased in his lorry with the help of PW 3. PW2 had thereafter learnt that the

Appellant's wife had died.

As per the evidence of PW7, who prepared the Post-mortem Report there were

33 injuries found on the body of the deceased and 17 of them were on the back

of her body. The cause of death as stated by PW7 was due to bleeding in the

brain and spinal cord from the injuries caused by a blunt object. He further

states that most of the injuries found on her body were likely to cause the- death

of the deceased. PW7 had further observed that injuries on the neck of the

deceased were consistent with a person strangling her from behind.

The Appellant, in his dock statement denied the charge levelled against him and

stated that he had returned home on the day in question and he had seen the

deceased washing her wounds near the well. The Appellant had then asked her

what happened, to which she had replied that she had been attacked by a cow.

The Appellant further states ,that the deceased had refused to seek medical

treatment therefore he had gone to the pharmacy to bring medicine. He states

further that he does not know what may have happened before he came home

and whether someone else had troubled her in his absence.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant raises two grounds of Appeal;

5

a) The items of circumstantial evidence are wholly inadequate to draw a

necessary, inescapable and irresistible inference of guilt against the

Appellant, and

" b) In any event medical evidence and the findings of the learned High Court

Judge do not support a conviction for murder but for culpable homicide

not amounting to murder.

On perusaJ of the impugned Judgment of the learned High Court Judge it is

clear that from the outset the learned Trial Judge has been cautious to first

discuss required standard of proof in a criminal case especially in cases where

circumstantial evidence is produced against an Appellant. The learned Trial

Judge refers to the case of Pant is Vs. The Attorney-General 1998 (2) SLR 148

which held that;

"As the burden of proof is always on the prosecution to prove its case

beyond reasonable doubt and no such duty is cast on the accused and it is

sufficient for the accused to give an explanation which satisfies Court or

at least is sufficient to create a reasonable doubt as to his guilt,

As the trial Judge was a trained Judge who would have been aware that

the burden of proof was on the prosecution to prove its case beyond

reasonable doubt if a reasonable doubt was created in his mind as to the

guilt of the accused he would have given the benefit of that doubt to the

accused and acquitted him."

I I ! I i ! t

He also reters to the case of Queen Vs. Sumanasena 66 NLR 350 which held

inter alia,

'"In our OpInIOn the learned Judge's direction is wrong. Suspicious

circumstances do not establish guilt. Nor does the proof of any number of

suspicious circumstances relieve the prosecution of its burden of proving

the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt and compel the

accused to give or call evidence. We are unable to reconcile what the

learned Judge said earlier in his sumlYJing-up with what he said in the

passage to which exception is taken. The burden of establishing

circumstances which not only establish the accused's guilt but are also

inconsistent with his innocence remains on the prosecution throughout

the trial and is the same in a case of circumstantial evidence as in a case

of direct evidence."

It is with this understanding the learned Trial Judge commences the evaluation

of the evidence placed before him.

With regards to the injuries sustained by the deceased the prosecution's version

is that they were caused by the Appellant. The Appellant denies this and states

that they were caused by a cow (allegedly this is what the deceased had told

him). The independent medical evidence (PW7) confinns that these injuries are

inconsistent with the version of the defence. The evidence of PW5 revealed that

the deceased was constantly subject to abuse by the Appellant, therefore this

Court is inclined to hold that the leamed High Court Judge was correct 111

finding that it was the Appellant who caused the injuries to the deceased.

PVW7 further observes that the injuries caused to the deceased were few days

old. The Appellant admits that he requested for medicine from PWl. PWI states

that the Appellant requested medicine for a headache and leg wounds. The

medical evidence reveals that the deceased was injured far beyond what the

Appellant had disclosed to PWYl. It is also clear that the Appellant has failed to

seek medical treatment for the deceased for about 3 days prior to her been found

unconscious, by which time it was too late. The learned DSG submits that as

per Section 30 of the Penal Code an 'Act' also includes an omission.

As the learned DSG submits that the injuries caused to the deceased was

through a systematic assault. Thereafter, it seems that she was gravely neglected

by her Husband, the Appellant, which ultimately led to her death. The learned

High Court Judge has considered all relevant circumstances and determined that

the Appellant's actions / inactions established the offence of murder.

In the case of Ariyadasa V s. Attorney General 2012 (1) SLR 84 it was held inter

alia that;

"Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb a finding of a Judge with regard

to the acceptance or rejection of a testimony of a witness, unless it is

manifestly wrong, when the trial Judge has taken such a decision after

observing the demeanour and the deportment of a witness. The contention

that the eye witness was not a credible witness is rejected."

It was further held in the said case that;

"The prosecution must prove the following facts before it can bring a case

under Section 294.

(i) It must establish quite objectively that a bodily injury is present.

(ii) The nature of the injury must be proved. These are purely

objective investigations.

(iii) It must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that

particular bodily injury, that is to say that it was not accidental or

unintended or some other kind of injury was intended.

Once these elements are proved to be present, the Inquiry proceeds

further.

(iv) It must be proved that the injury is sufficient to cause death in

the ordinary course of nature.

This part of the inquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing

to do with the intention of the offence.

Once these four elements are established the offence is murder under

Section 294

It does not matter that there was no intention to cause death. This part of

the inquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with

the Intention of the offence.

It does not matter that there was no intention even to cause an injury of a

kind that is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.

Once the intention to cause bodily injury actually found to be present is

proved, the rest of the inquiry is purely objective and the only question is

whether, as a matter of purely objective Inference, the injury is sufficient

in the ordinary course of nature to cause death."

9

This Court finds that the ingredients required to establish the offence of Murder

discussed in the abov~ case are relevant to the instant Appeal and further that

the prosecution has established these ingredients against the Appellant, beyond

reasonable doubt.

The learned Trial Judge has been mindful of the nature of evidence against the

Appellant by referring to the case of King Vs. Appuhamy 46 NLR 128 in which

it was held inter alia that;

"In order to justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial

evidence, the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence

of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable-

hypothesis the that of his guilt."

The impugned judgment further refers to the case of King Vs. Abeywikrama 44

NLRe 254 in which it was held inter alia;

"In order to base a conviction on circumstantial evidence the Jury must be

satisfied that the evidence was consistent with the guilt of the accused and

inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis of his innocence."

It is evident therefore that the learned Trial Judge, after a careful evaluation of

the evidence placed before him and giving due regard to the nature of the

evidence has concluded that the circumstantial evidence against the Appellant is

consistent with his guilt and not of his innocence. Having considered the

submissions of both parties, this Court finds that the only inference that can be

drawn is that the Appellant's actions / inactions had caused the death of the

deceased.

10

In light of the corroborated circumstantial evidence against the Appellant, this

Court tlnds no reason to disturb the findings of the learned Trial Judge and

therefore, we affirm the conviction and sentence dated 01.10.2014 and dismiss

the instant Appeal.

Appeal Dismissed.
