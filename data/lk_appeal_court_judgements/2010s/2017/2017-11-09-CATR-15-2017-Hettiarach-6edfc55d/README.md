L.T.B. Dehideniya J. (PICA)

This is an application to transfer two connected cases from the High Court

of Embilipitiya oil the basis of bias shown by the learned High Court Judge.

The Petitioner complains that he was denied a fair trial by the attitude

adopted by the learned High Court Judge.

We considered the proceedings taken place before the High Court and the

affidavit submitted by the Defence Counsel. On the face of the application,

we observe that the Petitioner has shown a reasonable cause of distress on

his part in hearing these two cases by the presiding Judge.

Weare of the view that this is a proper case to issue an interim order staying

further proceeding until final determination of this application.

Accordingly, we make an interim order as prayed for in the paragraph (b) of

the prayer to the petition staying proceeding in case nos. HCE 112016 and

HCE 3/2016 held in the High Court of Embilipitiya until final determination

of this application.

Further, we issue notice on the Respondents.

Shiran Gooneratne J.

I agree.
