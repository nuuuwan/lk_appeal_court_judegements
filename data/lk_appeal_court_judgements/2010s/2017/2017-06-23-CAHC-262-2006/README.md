COUNSEL : Dr. Ranjith Fernando for the

Accused - Appellant

Yasantha Kodagoda A.S.G, P.C.

for the Attorney General

ARGUED ON : 24th May, 2017

DECIDED ON : 23rd June, 2017

Oeepali Wijesundera J.

The accused - appellant was charged under section 459 of the

Penal Code for submitting as genuine a forged document to court and

was convicted to two years RI and a fine of Rs. 50,000/= was also

imposed.

The accused appellant lived on an estate owned by the Plantation

Corporation on a lease agreement to harvest cinnamon and carda mons

on the estate. The appellant was ordered to vacate the estate and

eviction proceedings had been filed in the Magistrates Court.

Section 459 of the Penal Code reads thus;

2

"whoever fraudulently or dishonesty uses as genuine any

document which he knows or has reason to believe to be

a forged document shall be punished in the same manner

as if he had forged such document"

The Attorney-at-Law on behalf of the accused appellant had shown

a document authorizing harvesting of Cardamons etc for ten years to

court, which the Magistrate stated had unfilled blanks space therefore the

court had returned the document to the Attorney-at-Law and rejected the

document. The Magistrate had referred the document to the CID for

investigation. This had been recorded by the Magistrate on 17th January

1996.

The Magistrate before whom the document was marked and

produced has testified In the High Court that when he first saw the

document there were unfilled blanks in the document. On a subsequent

occasion the blanks have been filled. The said document was marked

and produced in the High Court as P3 and the learned Magistrate has

identified the said document.

3

Director of the Plantation Corporation giving evidence in the High

Court has stated that the signature appearing in P3 is questionable and

that the signature mayor may not be his. He (vide page 378 and 379 of

the brief) also had stated that the agreement to harvest cinnamon and

cardomons differ and that the date signed by him appears to be four

months prior to the accused appellant signing it.

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the charges

as per indictment related to an offence under section 459 of the Penal

Code but on the evidence it is evident it should have been under section

452 of the Penal Code and that it is unsafe to convict a person under

section 459 when it should have been under section 452.

A person is said to have made a false document who dishonesty

or fraudulently makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a

document with the intention of causing it to be believed as a genuine

document is guilty of dishonesty or fraudulently using a forged

documents. The accused appellant had tendered P3 to court knowing

that the document was false.

The learned counsel for the appellant citing the judgments in AG

vs Karunaratne 78 NLR 413, AG vs Walgamage (1990) 2 SLR 212, AG

4

vs Ananda (1995) 2 SLR 315 and AG vs Kumara (2003) 1 SLR 139

stated that since 21 years have lapsed from the date of commission of

this offence and over 10 years since the conviction and considering the

present age of the accused appellant and the nature of the offence to

consider imposing a lesser sentence.

The learned High Court Judge has carefully analysed the evidence

placed before him and come to a correct finding. For the afore stated

reasons I see no reason to interfere with a well considered judgment.

Since the accused appellant has produced a forged document to court I

am not inclined to interfere with the sentence. Judgment and conviction

dated 06/09/2006 of the High Court is affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.
