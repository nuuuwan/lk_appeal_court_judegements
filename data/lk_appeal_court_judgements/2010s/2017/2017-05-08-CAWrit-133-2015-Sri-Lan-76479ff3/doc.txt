We have considered in detail, the arguments adduced in this case, with regard to the impugned award

of compensation made by the 3rd Respondent Arbitrator, in favour of 4th Respondent, produced

marked A-4(a) and A-4 (b) and the specific amount of the said award of compensation made,

amounting to Rs. 5, 907, 853.32, which amount the Petitioner has substantially challenged in this writ

application, as being arbitrary and excessive.

We have also take cognizance of the purported methodology of computation set-out by the arbitrator,

and also of the oral submissions made on behalf the Petitioner with regard to the same and to the case

law cited.

We find that the arbitrator has calculated the quantum of compensation from 1999, being the year of

termination, all the way up to the 4th Respondent workmen's notional date of retirement in the year

2013.

In all the circumstances of the case, including the judgment of the Court of Appeal in the previous

writ application bearing No CA (Writ) 273/2007, and the proceedings in the Supreme Court in SC

(SPL) LA Application No 121/2013 and having due regard to the abiding requirement stipulated by

law that awards compensation cannot be arbitrary computed or unduly excessive, we have given our

anxious consideration to the matter and are of the view that granting compensation up to the age of

retirement i.e. 2013, in a mechanical manner, is excessive in all the circumstances of this case, and

therefore, not warranted.

We have also taken in to account, prayers (b) and (c) of the petition dated 26.03.2015, filed by the

Petitioner, in conjunction with prayer (e) thereof.

In the said reliefs, the Petitioner has prayed and invited this court to, in the first instance, issue

mandates in the nature of writs of Certiorari, quashing the impugned arbitral award of the 3rd

Respondent arbitrator, dated 12.11.2014, produced marked A4 (a), as well as the publication of the

said award, as contained in the Government Gazette Extraordinary No 1895/20, dated 01.01.2015,

produced marked A-4 (b), and furthermore, in terms of prayer (e) of the said petition, the Petitioner

has invited this court to reduce the amount of the award of compensation.

In view of the finding of this court that the quantum of compensation awarded to the 4th Respondent,

is excessive and not warranted, we are of the view that mandates in the nature of writs of Certiorari

should be issued in terms of prayers (b) and (c) of the petition dated 16.03.2015, and we accordingly

proceed to:

i) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari, quashing the award of the 3rd

Respondent, dated 12.11.2014, in arbitration bearing No N3196, marked A-4 (a) and

ii) Issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari, quashing the said award published in

the Government Gazette Extraordinary, dated 01.01.2015, as reflected in A-4(b)

Furthermore, in the exercise of the discretion of this court, we further proceed to grant prayer (e) to

the petition, and instead of the impugned award of Rs. 5, 907,853.32 made by the 3rd Respondent,

which is now quashed, we make order the payment of compensation to the 4th Respondent, to a total

sum of Rs. 4,500,000/=

In view of the above findings, granting any other relief as prayed by the Petitioner will not arise and

we consider the reliefs referred to above, as being just and equitable in all the circumstances.

In view of the pendency of this dispute for a very long period of time, we direct that the said reduced

sum of Rs. 4,500,000 be paid by the Petitioner to the 4th Respondent within one month of the date of

this order i.e. on or before 05.06.2017.

Application allowed. No costs.
