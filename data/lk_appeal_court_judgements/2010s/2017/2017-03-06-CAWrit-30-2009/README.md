I t I 6

The document marked P 7 is a letter dated 2008-02-19 written by the

Divisional Secretary of Ja-ela, addressed to the Commercial Engineer of

Ceylon Electricity Board. The document produced marked P 16 is a letter

dated January, 2009 written by the Divisional Secretary of Ja-ela addressed

to the Electricity Engineer of Ceylon Electricity Board.

The document produced marked P 1 is a notice dated 2007-11-09, sent by

Ceylon Electricity Board.

When this case was taken up on 2011-10-18 this court had directed the

Government Agent to appoint a Divisional Secretary other than the

Divisional Secretary who made the impugned order in this case to hold an

inquiry and arrive at a decision. The said order further states as follows;

" ...... The Government Agent is further directed to appoint the inquirer

within 6 weeks from the receipt of the order. Additionally, the Government

Agent is also informed to direct the inquirer to conclude the inquiry and

communicate the decision within 3 months after the appointment of the

inquirer until then the impugned decision contained in documents P 7 and

P16 are quashed ..... "

7

Consequent to the above order a fresh inquiry was held by the Divisional

Secretary of Gampaha who was appointed for the said purpose. The said

inquiry report dated 2012-02-23 has been submitted to this court.

In view of the submissions made by the parties with regard to the question

whether the said order of this court made by Justice Rohini Marasinghe

dated 2011-10-18 is a final order or not, this court on 2015-10-07 had held

as follows:

" ....... Therefore it is seen that the aforesaid subsequent decision had been

made on a direction from this court. In that order made on 2011-10-18 it is

clearly stated that the decisions stating in the documents P 7 and P 16 are

quashed until the subsequent decision is made.

In view of the manner in which the said order is worded, no final order had

been made in respect of the relief sought in the petition. Therefore, all

three counsel agreed to have this matter re-argued ....... "

It is at this stage! that the learned counsel for the Petitioner, had moved to

amend the petition, in view of the subsequent decision made by the

1 On 2015-10-07.

,

8

Divisional Secretary of Gampaha. Respondents however had reserved their

right to object to any amended petition being filed.

Subsequent to the above application, learned counsel for the Petitioner has

filed the amended petition dated 2015-11-11 to which the learned counsel

for the ih Respondent had objected. 2 The ih Respondent had thereafter

filed a limited statement of objections dated 2015-12-15.3

It is for the purpose of deciding whether this court should permit the

Petitioner to file the said amended petition dated 2015-11-11 that the

instant inquiry was held by this court on 2017-01-09. This court heard

submissions of learned counsel for all the parties in the course of the said

inquiry.

Learned President's Counsel who appeared for the ih Respondent drew the

attention of this court to the prayers of the amended petition dated 2015-

11-11 which is sought to be filed by the Petitioner.

It could be seen inter alia, that the following prayers;

2 Vide journal entry dated 2015-11-13 in the docket.

3 Vide journal entry dated 2015-12-08 & 2015-12-16 in the docket.

9

Prayer (c) -issue mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the

purported orders issued by the 9th Respondent contained in P

29.

Prayer (d) -issue mandate in the nature of writ of Mandamus directing the

1 st Respondent to enforce the decision contained in P 9.

Prayer (f) - grant interim relief restraining the 1st -6th and Sth -9th

Respondents or any authorized officer or servants of the 1st -

6th and Sth - 9th Respondents acting in terms of the documents

marked P 14, P 26 and P 29 until the final determination of

this application,

are new prayers which have found their way into the amended petition.

The document marked P 9 produced along with the amended petition had

earlier been produced with the original petition marked P 5. It is a letter

dated 200S-0 1-1 O.

The document referred to as P 29 in the amended petition is the inquiry

report dated 2012-02-23 made by the Divisional Secretary of Gampaha

consequent to the aforesaid order dated 2011-10-1S, of this court.

10

The Divisional Secretary of Gampaha has been made the 9th Respondent in

the amended petition.

It should be observed at this stage that only 8 Respondents have been

named in the original petition and that 9th and 10th Respondents in the

amended petition are new additions.

It is clear from the above sequence of events, that what the Petitioner is

seeking to challenge by the amended petition is the document produced

marked P 29 which is a decision made by the Divisional Secretary of

Gampaha who is not a Respondent named in the original application

pending before this Court. Further, Divisional Secretary of Gampaha had

made that decision on 2012-02-23, a date which is later more than 3 years

than the date of filing the petition in this case.

It is the view of this court that the decision, the Petitioner seeks to impugn

by way of the amended petition filed in this proceedings, is a totally new

decision which did not form part of the subject matter that was agitated by

the Petitioner by his petition in this proceedings. Further, the said

subsequent decision was a nonexistent at the time the Petitioner filed this

application in this Court. Therefore the Petitioner is not entitled to

11

challenge that decision in this proceeding. That is exactly what the

Petitioner is seeking to do through the amended petition he seeks to file at

this moment.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons this court is of the

view that the move by the Petitioner to file an amended petition is

misconceived in law. Thus, this Court decides to refuse accepting the

amended petition that the Petitioner seeks to file.
