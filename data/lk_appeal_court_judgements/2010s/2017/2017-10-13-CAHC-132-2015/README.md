H.C. Anuradhapura Case No.HC 89(2003

S. DEVIKA DE L. TENNEKOON J AND

Indica Mallawaratchi for the Accused-Appellant

26.09.2017

Accused-appellant is present In Court produced by Prison

Authorities and represented by Counsel.

Counsel for the accused-appellant takes up an issue that the

accused-appellant was not given a fair trial at the High Court namely, he

had not been given a right enshrined in Section 195(ee) of the Criminal

Procedure Code. Further, she submits that the indictment was served on

the accused-appellant and he was not given the jury option. Further,

almost at the tail end of the trial, after about six years, it was brought to

the notice of the High Court Judge by the State Counsel that the jury

option was not given and the Counsel who was appearing for the accused-

appellant in the original Court has conceded to proceed with the trial and

he said that he can adopt the proceedings and matter could be tried before

1

Judge. The Counsel for the accused-appellant submits that, it is

insufficient under Section 195(ee) and several authorities decided by this

Court and the Supreme Court. In Hettiarachchi vs. The Attorney

General in CA No.130j2005 decided on 13.07.2012, it was held that-

"It is not a mere irregularity but an illegality that cannot be cured,

an illegality that vitiates the whole proceedings including the

judgment."

Further, she supports the argument with Queen vs. Hemapala 64 NLR

Page 1 - a decision by HjL Justice Godart. Further, she says that there

was no fair trial enshrined as stipUlated by The Attorney General vs.

Apponsu - Supreme Court - 2008 BLR 145 and she moves the Court to

hold that there is no trial held. Therefore, the conviction and the sentence

cannot stand and she moves that the matter be sent for retrial.

Senior Deputy Solicitor General Miss. Ayesha Jinasena who is

appearing for the Attorney General, upholding the highest tradition of the

Attorney General's Department submits to Court that she is agreeing with

the Counsel for the accused-appellant and submits, that there is no proper

jury option given to the accused-appellant. Further, she submits that

since the incident has happened in 1998 and the trial commenced in 2009

she moves the Court to send the case for retrial and direct the High Court

Judge to expedite the trial.

Considering the submissions of both Counsel, we are of the

view that the accused-appellant was not given the right as enshrined in

2

Section 195(ee) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 (as

amended.) Time and again this Court and the Supreme Court held, the

option of selecting the jury is a right of an accused to ensure that he had

a proper and fair trial. Therefore, this Court upholds the submissions by

both Counsels and set aside the conviction and the sentence and send this

case for retrial to the High Court of Anuradhapura. Further, we request

the High Court Judge to give priority to this case and conclude as soon as

possible.

Registrar is directed to forward the case record to the

Registrar, High court of Anuradhapura forthwith.

I agree.
