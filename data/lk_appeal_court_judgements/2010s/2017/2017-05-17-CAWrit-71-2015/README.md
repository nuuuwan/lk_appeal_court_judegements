JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The 1st Petitioner, as borne out by the document produced marked P 1,

is a welfare organization registered with the Rural Water Supply and

Sanitation Unit of the Western Provincial Council. Its primary purpose is

~ l t 1

,

distribution of pipe borne water to the houses of Tammitagama village

in the Maho Divisional Secretariat area. The 2nd Petitioner is the

. President of the said organization.

The said organization has obtained the service of the 3rd Respondent for

its work relating to the maintenance of the said project. It is significant

to note that the 3rd Respondent being a member of this organization is

also a recipient of benefits generated from this project.

It is the position of the 1st and 2nd Respondents that the 3rd Respondent

is an employee of the 1st Petitioner organization and hence the 1st

Petitioner organization is liable to pay Employees' Provident Fund

(hereinafter sometimes be referred to as EPF) to the 3rd Respondent.

This is on the basis of the declaration produced marked R 1.

Further the 1st and 2nd Respondents state that since the 1st Petitioner

organization has failed to pay the said EPF contributions in terms of

section 10 of the EPF Act, the application bearing No. 87550/LB dated

2014-07-16, has been filed in terms of section 38(2) of the EPF Act in

the Magistrate's Court of Maho.

I 5

It is prudent to commence analyzing the issue raised in this case by

listing out the salient features of the law pertaining to the liability of an

. employer to pay EPF.

They are as follows;

i. An employer becomes liable to contribute to the Employees'

Provident Fund in respect of any employee, only when his or her

employment is prescribed as a covered employmentl.

ii. In terms of the Provisions of the Employees' Provident Fund Act

regulations could be made to declare any employment referred to

in section 8 (1) of the EPF Act to be a covered employmenf.

iii. The Minister may make regulations in respect of all matters for

which regulations are required or authorized to be made under

this Act3.

It would also be useful to note that both the learned counsel for the

Petitioners as well as the 1st and 2nd Respondents, have concurred that

the Honourable Minister of Labour and Vocational Training, has by the

Gazette bearing No 653/16 dated 13th March 1991 declared that an

'employment in the service of any Charitable institution or any institution

1 Section 10 (1) of the Employee's Provident Fund Act.

2 Section 8 (2) of the Employee's Provident Fund Act.

3 Section 46 of the Employee's Provident Fund Act.

6

maintained solely for the purpose of religious worship or social service

being an institution or organization employing ten (10) or more persons'

, to be a covered employment. The Hon. Minister has specified the date

therein as the date from which the liability of such an employee and his

employer should commence, to pay their respective EPF contributions. A

Copy of the said Gazette bearing No 653/16 dated 13th March 1991 has

been produced marked P 114.

It is the submission of the learned counsel for the Petitioners that an

employer becomes liable to contribute to the Employees' Provident Fund

in respect of any of his employees only when such employment has

been declared as a covered employment in terms of Section 10 (3) read

with section 8 of the Employees' Provident Fund Act.

Learned Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the 1st and the 2nd

Respondents did not controvert any of the legal positions set out aboves.

However it is his position that the 1st Petitioner cannot claim an

exemption under the above Gazette as it is not conclusive whether it is a

charitable institution or any institution maintained solely for the purpose

of religious worship or social service, in terms of its Constitution

produced marked P 4. Learned Deputy Solicitor General further

4 Same Gazette has been produced annexed to the written submissions filed on behalf of the 1st & 2nd

Respondents,

submitted that there is no clear definition in the Act as to what is meant

by the term 'a charitable institution or any institution maintained solely

. for the purpose of religious worship or social service'.

It is to be noted that the fact that the 1st Petitioner is not 'an institution

which has employed 10 or more persons' has not been contested by the

1 st and 2nd Respondents6 Thus, the sole question left to be adjudicated

by this Court would be the question whether the 1st Petitioner is 'a

charitable institution or any institution maintained solely for the purpose

of religious worship or social service'.

The Constitution of the 1st Petitioner, produced marked P 4, shows

clearly that the primary purpose of the 1st Petitioner is to co-ordinate,

implement, manage and maintain a sustainable project for distribution

of pipe borne water and meeting the needs of sanitation facilities of

houses of Tammitagama village in the Maho Divisional Secretariat area.

Article 5-2-4 of the said Constitution also becomes noteworthy because

it has categorically restricted the membership of this organization to the

recipients of its water supply benefits.

The above facts, when taken along with the contents of the other

provisions of the said Constitution clearly indicate that the 1st Petitioner

6 Such institution which has employed less than 10 persons is not liable to contribute to EPF. -

I ' 8

is not an institution which has been designed to function as a

commercial organization, a kind of organization upon which the Gazette

. bearing No 653/16 dated 13th March 1991 (marked P 11) had sought to

impose a liability to contribute to EPF.

Further this institution has been registered with the Rural Water Supply

and Sanitation Unit of the Western Provincial Council as a welfare

organization (P ..!). The 3rd Respondent (IIIangarathna Bandara) is clearly

a beneficiary of this scheme. He is also a member of the 1st Petitioner.

Thus, the 3rd Respondent for all purposes is an active member of the

Organization and also a recipient of its benefits. The mere fact that the

3rd Respondent is paid Rs. 10,000/= per month in recognition of his

voluntary services to the Organization does not necessarily mean that he

must be categorized as an employee of this organization.

It must further be noted that no letter of appointment has ever been

issued to him by this organization. Indeed the perusal of the minutes of

the Annual General Meeting of this organization held on 2010-03-31,

produced marked P 6, clearly reveals that it was at that meeting, with

the concurrence of all the members present there, that the 3rd

Respondent had been proposed and seconded to function as the

controller of the distribution of water, of this project. Further the said

,

9

minutes reveal that name of one Anura (another member and also the

treasurer of the organization) was previously proposed and seconded. It

. also reveals that the necessity to propose 3rd Respondent's name had

arisen as said Anura had declined to accept the said responsibility7. This

being the procedure adopted to appoint the 3rd Respondent, would in

the mind of this Court, negate the proposition that the 3rd Respondent is

an employee of the 1st Petitioner.

It is to be noted that the 2nd Petitioner has submitted an appeal to the

2nd Respondent urging him to reconsider the decision with regard to the

liability to contribute to the EPF. This appeal has been produced marked

f..8. It transpires from the said appeal that the 3rd Respondent appear to

have stated at the Annual General Meeting of the organization held on

2014-09-14, that he does not intend claiming any money arising from

the instant dispute. However no step has been taken by the 1st and the

2nd Respondents, to verify this position.

This would be an appropriate juncture to turn to the legal submission

made on behalf of the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The position taken up by

the learned Deputy Solicitor General on behalf of them is that a writ

7 Page 4 of the minutes (P 6).

,

10

cannot lie since the issue whether this organization is a welfare

organization or not, is a disputed fact.

It must be stressed by this Court that mere denial of a fact by a party or

a mere statement that a fact is a disputed fact would not be sufficient to

push such a fact under the umbrella of 'disputed facts'. If this Court is to

consider such mere denial to be sufficient, this Court would be

compelled to refuse the issuance of writs whenever any such statement

in the form of 'I deny', 'I am unaware', 'I place the burden on the other

party to prove' etc. has been averred by the opposite party as has been

the case more often than not.

It is the view of this Court in the light of the above material that the 1st

and the 2nd Respondents do not appear to have or are in a position to

controvert any of the above facts leading to the negation of the

proposition that the 3rd Respondent is an employee of the 1st Petitioner.

All what the 1st and 2nd Respondents have done is to have made a bare

statement that a writ cannot lie since the issue whether the 1st Petitioner

is a welfare organization or not is a disputed fact.

Another significant observation that this Court could make with regard to

the liability of the 1st Petitioner to contribute to EPF is that the 1st and

the 2nd Respondents at no time had even attempted to state that the 1st

11

Petitioner is a commercial organization. The material available in this

case points strongly to the opposite of it. Thus the irresistible conclusion

, that this Court could arrive at from the above material is that the

Petitioners are not liable to contribute to EPF in respect of services of

the 3rd Respondent as the 3rd Respondent has not been engaged in a

covered employment within the meaning of the EPF Act.

It is to be borne in mind that the 1st and the 2nd Respondents can

exercise the power vested in them by section 38(2) of the EPF Act, only

'where an employer makes default in the payment of any sum which he

is liable to pay under this Act'. Thus, the issuance of any certificate

against a person who is not liable would not be in accordance with law.

Hence such an action would be ultra vires the authority imposed on the

1 st and 2nd Respondents by the Employees Provident Fund Act.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons this Court decides

to issue a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing;

i. the decision of the 1st and 2nd Respondents to recover a sum of

Rupees 100,400.00 from the Petitioners as arrears payable by

them as contributions to the Employee's Provident Fund, and

\

,I

12

ii. the subsequent decision to file the application bearing No

87550jLB in the Magistrate's Court of Maho against the 2nd

Petitioner.

Learned Magistrate of Maho is hereby directed to discontinue further

proceedings of the said case namely M C Maho case No 87550jLB

forthwith.

We make no order for costs.

Writ of Certiorari issued.
