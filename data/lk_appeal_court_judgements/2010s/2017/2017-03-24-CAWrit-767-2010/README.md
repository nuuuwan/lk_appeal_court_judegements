JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

At the commencement of the argument, learned counsel for the

Respondents took up a preliminary objection to the maintainability of this

application before this court on the basis that the orders which the

Petitioners have challenged in this proceedings are appealable orders. In

order to evaluate this argument it is necessary to look at the nature of the

orders under challenge in this application.

The orders which the Petitioners seeks to challenge in this application are

produced marked P 6(a) and P 9. The order marked P 6(a) is an order in

which the 1st Respondent, namely learned President of the Labour Tribunal

has refused permission to call another witness on behalf of the Petitioner

"

who was the respondent in that case. It must be noted that this application

had been made after both parties had closed their respective cases and on

the date fixed for filing of Written Submissions. The applicant too had

concluded his evidence by that time.

The other order marked P 9 which is being challenged in this proceedings

is the final order of the 1st Respondent President of the Labour Tribunal.

That order was delivered after the completion of the case before him and

hence is the final order of that case.

It is the position taken up by the Petitioners that the above orders made by

the 1st Respondent (i. e. Orders marked P 6(a) and P 9 dated 13/09/2010

and 26/10/2010, respectively) are illegal, null and void and of no force or

avail in law, inter alia because!;

a) they are ultra Vires the purport and ambit of the Industrial Disputes

Act No. 43 of 1950 (as amended) and / or Termination of

Employment of Work.men (Special Provisions) Act No. 45 of 1971 (as

amended);

b) there is error "on the face of the record" itself;

I

c) they are against the principles of natural justice;

d) they are unreasonable and/or irrational;

e) they offend the principles of fairness and/or proportionality;

f) they are arbitrary, capricious, unwarranted and manifestly irregular;

g) they are procedurally flawed;

h) they amount to a failure to uphold the Petitioners' substantive

legitimate expectations;

i) they tantamount to an abuse of due process of law guaranteed to

citizens of this Republic which independent of all other grounds and

without prejudice thereto, constitute matters fit & proper to be

reviewed and set aside by this Court in the exercise of the jurisdiction

of this Court under Article 140;

j) they, if permitted to stand, also constitutes a violation of the

Fundamental Rights of the Petitioners, particularly under Articles

12(1) and 14(1)g of the Constitution;

k) they are devoid of any valid reasoning and in fact no valid reasons

exist therefor.

It is on the aforesaid premises that the Petitioners state that they are

entitled in law ex debito justitiae and/or constitutionally as citizens of this

Republic to seek from this court,

7

(a) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

of the 1st Respondent dated 13/09/2010 marked P 6(a);

(b) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari quashing the decision

of the 1st Respondent dated 26/10/2010 marked P 9;

(c) A mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st

Respondent and/or 3rd Respondent from proceeding against the 1st

Petitioner in any manner whatsoever based on the above purported

findings/decisions marked P 6(a) dated 13/09/2010 and the decision

marked P 9 dated 26/10/2010.2

The Petitioners have taken up the position that alternate remedies will not

satisfactorily address the Petitioners grievances in the circumstances of this

case.

In view of the above submission by the Petitioner, it becomes necessary

for this Court to consider the nature of the alternate remedy that the

Petitioner has in this instance.

Section 310(3) of the Industrial Disputes Act specifically gives a right of

appeal to a party dissatisfied with an order of the Labour Tribunal to

prefer an appeal to the Provincial High Court on a question of law.

Section 310(9) of the Industrial Disputes Act has made the provisions of

Chapter XXVIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act relating to appeals

from Magistrate's Court to the Court of Appeal, have mutatis mutandis

been made applicable in regard to the matters connected with the hearing

and disposal of an appeal preferred under the above section.

It is relevant to note that section 328 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

which is in Chapter XXVIII therein has vested with the appellate court

powers of reversing the order of the original court, ordering a re-trial and

altering the judgment varying its conditions. Further, section 329 of the

Code of Criminal Procedure Act states that it is open for the Appellate

Court to direct, if it thinks necessary, that further evidence be taken.

It is also important at this juncture that this Court be mindful of the fact

that Section 31C (1) of the Industrial Disputes Act has clearly set out the

nature of the function of a Labour Tribunal. It is to the following effect:

,I

1 I

I I ! I i ! f

I ! I j l

" ...... Where an application under section 31B is made to a Labour Tribunal,

it shall be the duty of the tribunal to make all such inquiries into that

application and hear all such evidence as the tribunal may consider

necessary, and thereafter make, not later than six months from the date of

such application, such order as may appear to the tribunal to be just and

equitable ...... "

Traversing through the grounds upon which the Petitioners have stated

that they are entitled to writs under Article 140 of the Constitution clearly

show that all these grounds could be considered, evaluated and eventually

decided in the appeal in the light of the facts of the case. Therefore the

best forum to decide the issues that are being canvassed by the Petitioners

in this proceeding would be the Provincial High Court which would sit in

appeal to consider the impugned orders of the learned president of the

Labour Tribunal.

Writ jurisdiction conferred on this court by Article 140 of the Constitution is

a discretionary remedy which will be exercised at the discretion of the

Court. Availability of regular procedure provided for the exercise of a right

of appeal in which the appellate jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court

can be invoked in a wider scope than the writ jurisdiction should be

considered as an effective, convenient, satisfactory alternative that is

available to the Petitioners.

Indeed the learned counsel for the Petitioners in the course of his

submission conceded that the appeal filed by the Petitioners in the

Provincial High Court is pending at the moment.

The Petitioner has also specifically averred this in paragraph 17 of his

amended petition.

This court is mindful that the Supreme Court in Somasundaram Vs Forbes3

has held as follows:

" ..... In this area of the law where there is no illegality, the court should

first look into the question whether a statute providing for alternative

remedies expressly or by necessary implication excludes judicial review. If

not, where remedies overlap, the court should consider whether the

statutory alternative remedy is satisfactory, in all the circumstances ..... If

not the court is entitled to review the matter in the exercise of its

jurisdiction. Of course if there is an illegality, there is no question but that

the court can exercise its powers of review ...... "

Pursuant to the above judgment, this Court having considered the decision

in the above case4 held subsequently in the case of Ishak Vs Lakshman

Perera, Director General of Customs and othersS as follows:

" ....... Where there is an alternative procedure which will provide the

applicant with a satisfactory remedy the courts will usually insist on an

applicant exhausting that remedy before seeking judicial review. In doing

so the court is coming to a discretionary decision." "Where there is a choice

of another separate process outside the courts, a true question for the

exercise of discretion exists. For the court to require the alternative

procedure to be exhausted prior to resorting to judicial review is in accord

with judicial review being properly regarded as being a remedy of last

resort. It is important that the process should not be clogged with

unnecessary cases, which are perfectly capable of being dealt with in

another tribunal. It can also be the situation that Parliament, by

establishing an alternative procedure, indicated either expressly or by

im"plication that it intends that procedure to be used, in exercising its

discretion the court will attach importance to the indication of Parliament's

In that case also the Petitioner of that case himself had claimed that he

had already invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court to canvass the

identical facts before the competent regular court as per section 154 of the

Customs Ordinance and the court went on to observe in those

circumstances as follows:

" ....... In this context, the President's Counsel appearing for the Petitioner

has cited the case of Somasundaram Vanniasingham Vs. Forbes and

another6 and suggested that it represents a new approach to the rule

relating to alternative remedies in exercising writ jurisdiction.

The Respondents submit that this case has no application to the point

urged by them. In that case the court held that there is no rule requiring

the exhaustion of administrative remedies. The point urged by these

respondents is that there is an alternative statutory remedy for the

Petitioner before a court of law and not the availability of any.

administrative remedy. In these circumstances this court finds that as there

is an alternative, adequate remedy provided in section 154 of the Customs

Ordinance, and as the Petitioner himself has already instituted action

admittedly in the competent Court of civil jurisdiction, the Court would not

exercise its discretion in favour of the issue of its writ jurisdiction ...... ,,7

For the reasons set out above we are of the opinion that there is no

necessity for this court to go into the questions that have been agitated by

the Petitioners in this application since those issues could eventually be

decided by the Provincial High Court if so urged by any party in the appeal

that is pending before it. Further, if this court embarks on a task of

adjudicating upon the issues raised by the Petitioners in this case, such an

action would tantamount to hearing an appeal made against those two

impugned orders by the learned President of the Labour Tribunal. This

court cannot see any justification as to why this court should engage itself

in such an exercise under these circumstances. As has been referred to in

the judgment cited above, this Court is of the view that it being an

appellate court has a duty to regulate the tendency of the litigants to resort

to unnecessary multiple litigations particularly when there is a procedure of

litigation clearly laid down in iaw.

As regards the order marked P 6(a) it is to be noted that the learned

president of the Labour Tribunal by that order had refused to permit the 1st

Petitioner to call another witness on the date fixed for filing of written

submissions. It is relevant to note that by that time the 1st Petitioner who

was the Respondent in the case before the Labour Tribunal, having led the

evidence of his witnesses had closed his case.8 Thereafter at the end of the

inquiry he had closed his case for the 2nd time also.9

As the learned counsel for the Petitioner submitted that there are grounds

for the issuance of a writ on the basis he had set out in his petition, this

Court has to proceed to consider the nature of the evidence sought to be

placed before the Labour Tribunal by the witness whom the 1st Petitioner

had wanted to call subsequently.

The purpose as to why this witness was to be called has been clarified by

the Petitioners in their counter affidavit. According to paragraph 16(b), (c)

and (d) of the said counter affidavit and the document produced marked P

10 the intended witness one K A Wijeratne whose evidence was sought to

be adduced by the 1st Petitioner, has stated in the letter dated 2010-09-24

marked P 10 that the 2nd Respondent was found working at some

establishment in the months of June, July and August in the year 2010.

8 1st Petitioner had closed his case on 2009-12-08.

9 1st Petitioner had closed his case for the 2nd time on 2010-08-06.

,

15

However, it has to be borne in mind that the service of the 2nd Respondent

with the Petitioners had been terminated on 2008-10-17. In the light of

that fact, this Court is unable to see any merit in that argument as the

intended evidence does not appear to be relevant to the issues at hand.

Thus, the Petitioner's endeavor in this application to have a final judgment

of the Labour Tribunal quashed by a writ of Certiorari cannot be successful.

In these circumstances, we uphold the preliminary objection raised by the

learned counsel for the 2nd Respondent and proceed to dismiss this

application with costs.
