This matter was taken up before by different benches and finally before Justice L.T.B Oehideniya President CA and Justice Thurairaja on the 28th June 2017, the Petitioner made submissions and submitted that they will be confining themselves to the amended petition. Since the subject matter is greatly varied from the substantive application they moved issuance of formal notice on the Respondents and supported for interim relief as prayed in the second petition. Both counsels agreed that the subject matter will be confined to the amended petition. If the court issues notice and/or grant interim relief this matter will continue, if not this matter will be terminated with this order.

CA WRIT 154/2016 ORDER Page 5 of 8

Before I proceed to the substantive matter, I wish to consider the preliminary objections raised by the senior DSG. Among other things, the Respondents raise the following objections. a. The Petitioners have no locus standi to file and maintain this application b. The necessary parties are not before the court. c. Laches

Further, they raise objections of the public purposes does not come within the ambit of writ jurisdiction. At present stage, the interim relief prayed cannot be granted and it will be a futile exercise. They also submitted that the acquiring progress had been taken to a stage where the balance of convenience lies with the state.

As per the available material, it is noted that the said property in question extends about 108 acres was a trust called 'Agnes-Peter Charitable Trust' and it was with the Public Trustee. The Petitioners claim that some of land belong to them. Considering the petition and the objections, the Petitioners have not established that this property entirely belongs to them or they are contesting this case on behalf of the public as public interest litigation case. The Petitioner submits that they have locus standi in this matter.

According to the case of Environmental Foundation L TO Vs. Minister of Public Administration and Six others (1997) 2 SLR 306 it was held that: "However, there are decisions both here and abroad which have expanded the principle of locus standi to include an applicant, who can show a genuine interest in the matter complained of and that he comes before Court as a public-spirited person, concerned to see that the law is obeyed in the interests of all [See: Wijesiri v Siriwardena],

unless any citizen has standing, therefore, there are no means of keeping public authorities within the law, unless the Attorney-General will act- which frequently he will not. That private person should be able to obtain some remedy was, therefore "a matter of high constitutional principle". - Lord Denning M.R. - R V Paddington Valuation Office (1966) 1 QB 380. Nevertheless, the Court would not listen to a mere busybody who was interfering in things which did not concern him. But will listen to anyone whose interests are affected by what has been done. In any event, if the application is made by what for convenience one may call a stranger, the remedy is purely discretionary. Court retains the discretion to refuse to act at the instance of a mere stranger it considers that no good would be done to the public. As a party genuinely interested in the matter complained of, the Petitioner has the locus standi to make this application.

As per Shiranee Thilakawardena, J in Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Another - SLR - 146, Vol 3 of 2003 [2003] LKCA 81; (2003) 3 Sri LR 146; "Writ of Certiorari is available even to strangers because of the element of public interest. Every citizen has standing to invite the Court to prevent some abuse of power, and in doing so he may claim

to be regarded not as a meddlesome busybody but as a public benefactor"

The Respondents submit that the Petitioners do not have any locus standi.

The Oxford dictionary of law defines the English meaning of the Latin term "locus standi" as 'a place to stand'. Its legal definition is "The right to bring an action or challenge a decision". The Wharton's Concise Law Dictionary defines the term as 'The right of as party to appear and be heard on the question before any tribunal'. The Black's Law Dictionary defines as "The right to bring an action or to be heard in a given forum".

In the case of A.R.Perera and others Vs. Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka (2006) 1 Sri LR 83, the dictum of Lord Denning in R V Paddington Valuation Office (1966) 1 QB 380 at 401 on locus standi is described as,

"The court would not listen, of course, to a mere busybody who was interfering in things which did not concern him. But it will listen to anyone whose interests are affected by what has been done"

In the case of Premadasa V Wijeyewardena and others (1991) 1 Sri LR 333, considering the right to bring an application for Writ of Certiorari, the court held that; The law as to locus standi to apply for certiorari may be stated as follows. The writ can be applied for by an aggrieved party who has a grievance or by a member of the public. If the applicant is a member of the public he must have sufficient interest to make the application.

His Lordship A.W.A.Salam, J in the case of M.M.Sonali Fernando Vs. A.G CA APN 144/2007 held that;

"In law, locus standi is generally understood to be right to bring an action, to be heard in Court, or to address the Court on a matter before it"

Considering the arguments submitted by both parties, I find that the Petitioners have not established that they have locus standi. For the purpose of completeness, I wish to consider the submissions made by both parties. The Respondent submits that the Petitioners are guilty of laches. Regarding the medical faculty, Section 2 notices were issued on 15th March 2016 and now it is processing the acquisition. Since both parties are not challenging, the court rules that the Petitioners have no objection of acquiring this said land for the purpose of constructing medical faculty for the state university.

Regarding the acquisition of land for industrial complex, Section 2 notice was issued on the 18th December 2015 and a Section 7 notice was issued on the 23rd May 2016. It is revealed that the Petitioners have not challenged at the initial stage when the acquisition process was proceeding. There is no explanation submitted by the Petitioner why he did not seek the statutory remedy.

In the case of Seneviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and Another (1999) 2 Sri LR 341 Amerasinghe, J adverting to the question of long delay, commented that

If a person were negligent for a long and unreasonable time, the law refused afterwards to lend him any assistance to enforce his rights; the law both to punish his neglect, Nam leges vigilantibus, non dormientibus, subveniunt, and for other reasons refuses to assist those who sleep over their rights and are not vigilant.

In the case of Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services Ratnapura and Another (1996) 2 Sri LR 70 the court of appeal held that:

" A Petitioner who is seeking relief in an application for the issue of a Writ of Certiorari is not entitled to relief as a matter of course, as a matter of right or as a matter of routine. Even if he is entitled to relief, still the Court has a discretion to deny him relief having regard to his conduct, delay, laches, waiver, submission to jurisdiction - are all valid impediments which stand against the grant of relief."

Considering the amended petition and two written submissions filed by the Petitioners could not offer a reasonable and plausible explanation for the delay. This warrants the court to find that the Petitioners guilty of laches. The court also observes that the Petitioners have not brought necessary parties before the court.

With the available material, we find that the acquisition procedure has reached a considerable stage and discussing the public purpose and urgency will not arise.

Anyhow, the court observes that the state authorities can be more transparent in declaring their purpose when they are acquiring the property, that will help the people to decide whether they are contesting this matter or not.

Considering all available materials, I do not find that this is an appropriate case for the court to issue the notice. Hence, issuance of notice is refused.

Since both parties agreed that if the issuance of notice is refused, the original application will also be terminated. Accordingly, I terminate further proceedings in this matter.

Notice refused and petition dismissed without cost.
