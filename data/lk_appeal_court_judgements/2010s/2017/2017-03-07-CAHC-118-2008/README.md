The Accused-Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Batticaloa for the murder of his wife, Mohamed Haniffa Rizwana, under section 296 of the Penal Code and was convicted and sentenced to death.

The story of the prosecution is that, on the day of the incident, the deceased had gone to the Accused-Appellant's barber-shop in a three-wheeler in the night to ask the Appellant to come home. Having initially refused to come home, the Appellant had eventually accompanied the deceased in the same three-wheeler to the matrimonial home of the deceased. Subsequently, the deceased was found in flames and was taken to hospital by the Appellant himself.

The deceased died 21 days after the incident. She has made a dying declaration to the mother, the 1st Witness, saying that the Appellant after dousing her with Kerosene oil set fire to her.

The argument of the learned Counsel of the Appellant was that the learned High Court Judge was silent on the dying declaration.

The learned Counsel further submitted that the Appellant had tried to put-out the fire with a gunny-sack which was later found by the Police at the crime scene.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted that the evidence shows that the Appellant and the deceased were constantly quarrelling with each other; the reason being the Appellant visiting his 1st wife who is also the elder sister of the deceased.
