The accused appellants were indicted in the High Court of

Polonnaruwa along with another person for committing house trespass in

order to commit robbery under Section 436 of the Penal Code read with

Section 32 of the Penal Code.

They were also indicted for committing robbery of cash and

jewellery which is an offence punishable under Section 380 of the Penal

Code and for using a firearm in the course of the same transaction which

is an offence punishable under Section 44 (a) of the Firearms Ordinance

read with Section 32 of the Penal Code.

They were convicted for trespass and robbery anq sentenced to 5

years RI with a fine of Rs. 5,0001= carrying a default sentence of 1 year

for the first count. They were also sentenced for 8 years RI with a fine of

Rs. 5,0001= with a default sentence of 1 year RI for the second count.

This appeal is from the said sentence and the conviction. The story

of the prosecution is that on the day in question three persons have gone

to the complainant's house, whilst one was holding the occupants at gun

point the others have demanded that the money in the house be handed

over. Prosecution Witness No.1 has said that he identified the accused

when the cloth cQvering their face dropped. (vide page 134 of the brief).

The counsel argued that the prosecution has failed to elicit from

the witness under what light the accused were identified. We find that

there is no evidence to establish that the accused were identified under

sufficient light. Therefore we agree with the argument of the counsel of

3

t r \

~ t ! ,

the appellants on this issue of identification. The counsel for the

appellants argued that the accused were arrested three months after the

incident and they were kept in the police station under a detention order

for another two months and the identification parade was held thereafter.

Although the parade notes have been admitted by the appellants

in the High Court they have challenged holding of the sai~ parade, on the

basis that they were taken out on several occasion whilst they were being

held in the Matale Police Station. The prosecution has not given a

reasonable explanation as to why the parade was held two months after

the appellants were arrested.

It was held in Roshan vs AG 2011 1 SLR 364 that; "The

identification parade, if it is to be of value, must be held at the earliest

opportunity, so that the impression of the witness remains fresh in his

mind and he does not have the chance of comparing notes with others."

Therefore since the parade had been held two months after the

arrest of the appellants we decide that there has been no proper

identification of the appellants as stated by the counsel for the appellants.

Although not mentioned by the appellants or the respondent we find that

4

the second charge is defective and the appellants have not been properly

charged.

Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act states thus;

"For every distinct offence 0/ which any person is accused there

shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried

separately except in the cases mentioned in sections 174,175,176

and 180 which said sections may be applied eit~er'severally or in

combination. "

For the forgoing reasons the conviction and sentence dated

21.10.2014 are both set aside. I acquit first and second appellants.

Appeal allowed.
