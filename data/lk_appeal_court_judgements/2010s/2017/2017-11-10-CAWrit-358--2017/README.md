Respondents in Case No. DSP/460117 in the District Court of Colombo. On the

notice returnable date of the said case, the Counsel appearing for the Respondents

and also vacated the enjoining order obtained by the Petitioner preventing the

auction of the mortgaged properties. The said order was subject to the rights of the

parties until appropriate orders were made by the Commercial High Court.

The Petitioner states that the 1 st Respondent thereafter caused publication of

a notice of sale in the Government Gazette and Newspapers, dated 20th October

2017, to hold a public auction on 10th November 2017, to sell the mortgaged

properties.

The said notice of sale was published after the transfer of the said case to

the Commercial High Court. The Petitioner further states that a leave to appeal

application in respect of the Learned District Judge's order dated 31 st August

2017, was filed before the Civil Appeal High Court of Colombo which is to be

supported on 11 th January 2017.

It is observed that the Petitioner's case is pending, listing in the

Commercial High Court of Colombo. In the interim, there are no statutory or

procedural inhibitions for the Petitioner to make an application to the Commercial

High Court for appropriate relief.

From time to time the Superior Courts have held, that, it is within the

discretion of this Court to refuse to issue writ, if it is perceived that the Petitioner

has an adequate and appropriate alternative remedy.

4

In the circumstances we hold that the Petitioner has an adequate alternative

remedy to address the reliefs prayed for.

In the circumstances notice refused.

Petition is dismissed without costs.
