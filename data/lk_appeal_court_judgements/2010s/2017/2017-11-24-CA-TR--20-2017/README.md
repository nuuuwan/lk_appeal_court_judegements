The Accused Petitioner, (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

staying further proceedings before the Honourable High Court Judge , until the

notice on the Respondents and further reserved the right of the Petitioner to

support the application for interim relief, if the need arises. Thereafter the case

was mentioned on 26th November 2017 and t h November 2017, where the Court

has directed to issue notice on the Respondents, returnable on 21 st November

2017. By motion dated 16th November 2017, the Accused Petitioner has moved to

support an application for interim relief on 21 st November 2017.

We have heard the President's Counsel for the Accused Petitioner and the

President's Counsel for the Respondent's in respect of the said motion dated 16th

November 2017.

The President's Counsel appearing for the accused Petitioner, has drawn

the attention of Court to the following issues in support of this application.

a) Observations made in Proceedings dated 13th November 2017, in Case

No. HC 8570/16, by the Hon. High Court Judge in reference to the

Transfer Application No. CA (TR) 20117.

b) Observations made by the Hon. High Court Judge at page 50 of the

Judgement dated i h September 2017, and page 58 in Court proceedings

dated 7th September 2017, in the said Case No. HC 8026115,

as averred in paragraph 22 of the Petition.

The Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the accused petitioner presently

stands indicted before the High Court of Colombo in 3 cases, which are fixed for

triall to be called before the High Court of Colombo. With reference to Case No.

HC 8546116 and HC 8222116, the Petitioner submits that HC 8546116, initially

listed before High Court No.6 was referred to High Court No.1 for reallocation to

another High Court on the basis that another case against the same accused was

already listed for trial before the Hon. Judge. The Hon. High Court Judge had

declined to hear HC 8226/16, on the basis that the Accused Petitioner had filed a

Writ Application No. 89/2017, therefore has referred the said case for reallocation.

The Petitioner further states that on 15th June 2017, when Counsel

appearing for the Accused Petitioner made application before the Hon. High Court

Judge in Case No. HC 8570116, drawing attention to the Writ Application No.

89/2017 pending in this court, the Hon. High Court Judge has refused and declined

to send the said case for reallocation on the basis that up to the said date notices

had not been issued in the said Writ Application and therefore has proceeded to fix

the said case for trial.

On 13th November 2017, when case bearing No. HC 8570/16, was

mentioned before Court No.6, the court directed the trial to be taken up "day to

day thereafter as much as practicable".

The Counsel for the Petitioner has drawn attention to proceeding dated 13th

November 2017, in Case No. HC 8570116, and has referred to the order dated 15th

November 2017, where the Hon. High Court Judge has made reference to the

Transfer Application No. CA TR 20120 l7. The petitioner has also brought to the

attention of court the observations made by the Hon. High Court Judge in the

Judgement and court proceedings dated i h September 2017, in Case No. HC

8026/2015 and contends that by such observations the Hon. High Court Judge is

seen to be motivated by bias against the Petitioner and or with extraneous

5

considerations. Such contention is pleaded on the basis, inter alia, that the

Petitioner held a Cabinet portfolio in the previous administration.

When a substantive relief prayed for would be defeated in the absence of an

interim relief, the court should be mindful to protect the interest of the aggrieved

party until such time the substantive matter would be looked into. Every

application for interim relief should stand on its own merits and should be decided

on the facts and circumstances which may be uniquely distinct from one case to

the other. Therefore, it is a pressing need that a Petitioner should be heard on the

facts and circumstances of his case.

In the case before us, it is important to decide as to whether the said

observations were made at the discretion of the Hon. High Court Judge or whether

there was bias or a real likelihood of bias, taking into consideration that the said

observations were made in a different case. It is also important to consider whether

the Petitioner would be afforded a fair trial in the circumstances. Reference to the

said observations by the Hon. High Court Judge is averred to in the Petition dated

2ih September 2017, which was supported for notice on the Respondents on 2nd

October 2017. Having being satisfied with the submissions made by the counsel

for the Petitioner, the court ordered the issue of notices to the Respondents.

In Mahindasoma vs. Hon. Maithripala Senanayake and others (1996)

SLR Vol. 1 page 364, it was held that the court will be guided, inter alia, by the

following principles, in granting interim relief:

(a) Will the final order be rendered nugatory if the Petitioner is successful

(b) Where does the balance of convenience lie

I also refer to the case of Harrison Jayaweera Vs. K. w'A. Sunil Shantha

alias Ruwan and another

C.A. 969/2008 (Transfer), cited by the Respondents, where Ani! Gooneratne J.

states,

"the learned President's Counsel who appeared for the

Petitioner supported the application for transfer on 2.1.2009 in

terms of section 46 (1) (a) and (d) of the Judicature Act and sort

to demonstrate that his client would be denied a fair and an

impartial trial, and that it would be expedient to transfer the case

to be heard by another High Court Judge. Though the inquiry

was only for grant or refusal of interim relief, counsel on either

side made submission in support of each other's case more

particularly for and against the substantive issue of transfer of

the High Court case n.

I

"

However, in the present case the application by the Counsel for the

petitioner was limited to the interim relief prayed for by motion dated 16th

November 2017, which is subsequent to the order made by the Honourable High

Court Judge fixing the said case for trial. For the reasons stated above, we hold I I Ie 1

that the Petitioner has addressed the issues in support of this application, to the

satisfaction of court to proceed to hear the respective parties on the substantive

relief prayed for.

In the circumstances we are of the view that if a stay order is not granted at

this stage, the final relief prayed for will be rendered nugatory. We have also

considered the facts and circumstances in the light of public interest and the

interest of the petitioner and decide that the balance of convenience favours the

petitioner in this case.

Accordingly, we issue an interim order as prayed for in section (c) to the

prayer of the petition to be in force until the next date of hearing of this

application.
