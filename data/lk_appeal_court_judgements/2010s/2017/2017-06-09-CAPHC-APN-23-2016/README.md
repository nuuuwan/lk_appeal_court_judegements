Order

H. C. J. Madawala , J

This Revision Application dated 26th February 2016 has been filed by the

Substituted 2A Party Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner and 7th Party

Respondnet-Respondent-Petitioner to set aside the order of the Provincial

High Court of Central Province holden in Kandy delivered on 03/02/2016

and uphold the order dated 03/02/2010 made by the Learned Magistrate of

Gampola (Helboda) in case No. 24799 on 03/02/2010 and/or to dismiss the

said action No. 24799.

The position ofthe Substituted 2A Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner and

~ Respondent-Respondent-Petitioners were that the Officer in Charge of the

Police Station ofKothmale, the Complainant-Respondent-Respondent above

8

named filed information under section 66(1) of the Primary Court Procedure

Act on 19/1112008 in the Primary Court of Gampola (Helboda) in case No.

24799 citing the pt Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent, the deceased

2nd Party Respondent-Respondent in whose place the Substituted 2A Party

Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner was Substituted and the 3rd Party

Respondent-Respondent-Respondent.

It was submitted that the 4th, 5th, 6th,Jili and 8th Party Respondents

intervened in this case and that except the 15t Party Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondent the aforesaid parties were in possession of separate lots of the

estate called "Ramboda Estate" which is in extent about 837 acres for many

years as owners thereof. The 15t Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent

claimed title to the said estate and! or part thereof. Thereafter all parties filed

their respective counter affidavits and documents and their respective written

submissions. The Learned Magistrate of Helboda having considered same

delivered his order on 03/02/2010 holding that the following parties are

entitle to possession of the following extents of the said estate. Namely,

a. The pt Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent to an extent

of 52 acres which possession had been handed over to him in

the Gampola Court in case No. 24871L.

b. 4th Party Respondent-Respondent-Respondent to an extant of

15 acres.

c. 5th Party Respondent-Respondent-Respondent to an extent of

25 acres

58 acres and 9 perches

e. 7th Party Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner to an extent of65

acres

f. 2nd Party Respondent balance portion of the entire land.

9

Thereafter lapse of 8 months or so the 1 st Party Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondent sought to revise the said order by petition dated 30/8/2010

producing numerous documents, which were not a part of the Primary Court

proceedings. The Respondents filed their objections praying that the said

application be dismissed for the reasons set out therein. The 1 st Party

Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent filed his counter objections and all

parties filed their respective written submissions.

The Learned Judge of the High Court delivered in his order on 03/0212016

allowing the said revision application and has granted possession of the

entire estate to the pt Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent contrary to

the facts established by evidence.

10

The Petitioners pleaded that the order of the Learned High Court Judge is

wrong in law and should be set aside inter-alia for the following reasons.

a. The Learned High Court Judge's order is against the law, and the

weight of evidence,

b. The Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

preliminary objections raised by the Appellant in his objection

specially in respect of violation of Rule 3(1) (b) of the Supreme

Court Rules,

c. The Learned High Court Judge has erred and misconceived the

law applicable to section 66 under the Primary Court Procedure

Act namely to the concept of possession,

d. The Learned High Court Judge has not considered at all, the

objections, documents and the written submissions tendered by

these Petitioners specially with regard to the civil cases pending

in the District Court of Gampola and has stated that those cases

are finally adjudicated,

e. The Learned High Court Judge has totally failed to consider the

long and continued possession throughout by these Petitioners and

the other Respondent's in delivering the said judgment,

f. The Learned High Court Judge has not given reasons for the

decision specially on what ground that the 1 st Respondents-

Petitioner-Respondent had been awarded possession of the

11

entirety of the estate whereas 2nd to 8th Respondents documents

per se proves possession of their portions of the corpus,

g. The Learned High Court Judge has not given reasons to set aside

the order ofthe Learned Primary Court Judge and on what grounds

that it should be set aside it is not clear,

h. The Learned Judge ofthe High Court has failed to consider and/or

ascertain the portion, if any from which the 1 st Party Respondent-

Petitioner-Respondent claims to and! or have in fact been

dispossessed from in delivering the said judgment.

1. The Learned High Court Judge has made the said order under the

erroneous belief that decisions made by the District Court has a

bearing on the Primary Court Proceedings.

J. It is respectfully submitted that the said order is contrary to the

Provisions of the Primary Court Procedure Act as the 1 st Party-

Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent was never in possession of the

entirety of the said estate,

k. The Learned High Court Judge seriously misdirected herself when

she took into consideration certain documents pertaining to civil

cases and even found fault with the Learned Primary Court Judge

for not considering them when they were totally irrelevant for the

purpose of the determining the right of possession in terms of

section 68 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

ti t\ lI[IIII ! I, !

12

1. It is respectfully submitted that the said judgment of the Learned

High Court Judge is erroneous and! or is perverse and therefore is

liable to be set aside.

These Petitioners further stated that they have appealed against the order

of the High Court exercising their right of appeal in terms of Article 154 P

(6) of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka.

The 1st Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent has by way of motion

filed in the Magistrates Court of Gampola and Nawalapitiya moved for the

issuance of writ of execution of the said order of the said High Court despite

the appeal made by the those Petitioners as well as by the other Respondents

to the revision application.

The Petitioners further pleaded that the said order of the Learned High

Court Judge allowing the said revision application and setting aside order

made by the Learned Magistrate and directing the Registrar in the court is

wrong in law and will result in a grave miscarriage of justice to these

Petitioners.

It was contended that the circumstances set out above constitute

exceptional circumstances to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction of this court

13

and that the said order would be executed pending the appeal lodged by these

Petitioners in the exercise of their right of appeal provided for by article 154P

(6) of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka. The Petitioners had

pleaded for interim order staying all execution of the said order of the High

Court and the Magistrate Court pending the hearing and determination ofthis

application and / or the appeal made by the Petitioners, grave and irreparable

loss and damage would be caused to the Petitioners and! or miscarriage of

justice would be caused to them and! or their right of appeal would be

rendered nugatory.

The Petitioners tendered a true copy of the statement of objections filed

on behalf of the 7th Party Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner and the

Substituted 2A and 7th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioners prayed for the

relief in their petition. The 1 st Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent took

up the following preliminary objections and moved that the Petitioners

application should be dismissed in limine for the following reasons,

a. The Petitioners do not have the locus standi to have and maintain

this application;

b. The Petitioners have suppressed from, and!or misrepresented to the

court, material facts which were within their knowledge; and

14

c. The Petitioners have failed to give notice of this application to the

pt Party Respondent in terms of Rule 2 (1) and 2(2) of the Court

of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules of 1990.

The objections of the 6th Party Respondent-Respondent-Respondent was

that the order of the Learned High Court Judge should be set aside the inter

alia for the following reasons,

a. The Learned Judge of the High Court has erred in holding that the

Civil cases pending in the District Court of Gampola has been

finally adjudicated and has wrongly concluded that in the said cases

the entirety of the estate has been handed over to the 1 st Party

Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 1 st

Party Respondent)

b. The Learned Judge of the High Court has erred in law in failing to

consider the affidavit tendered to the Primary Court by the 2nd Party

1 st Respondent admitting the possession of the Respondent in

respect of the subject property.

c. The Learned Judge of the High Court has misdirected herself in law

in failing to consider the documentary evidence in support of the

Respondent's possession of the subject property.

15

d. The Learned Judge of the High Court has erred in law in taking into

consideration fresh material which were not available before the

Magistrate's Court, in making the said order.

e. The Learned Judge of the High Court has erred in law and fact in

concluding that exceptional circumstances existed in the matter

warranting the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction of the court.

f. The Learned Judge of the High Court has erred in law and fact in

failing to take the delay and laches on the part of the Petitioner in

her court in the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction of the court.

The Respondent whilst admitting the averments contained in paragraph 15

of the petition, the Respondent further states that -

a. The order by the Learned Judge of the High Court dated

03/0212016 merely allows the revision application of the

Petitioners and set aside the order of the Learned Magistrate of

the Primary Court of Helboda.

b. In effect the order of the Learned Judge of the High Court only

set aside the scheme of allocating the estate amongst the 1st Party

Respondent, 4th Party Respondent, 5th Party Respondent, 6th

Party Respondent, 7th Party Respondent and 2nd Party

Respondent made by the Learned Magistrate of the Primary

16

Court of Helboda, without any reference to the possession of the

property.

On considering the objections taken up by the parties one of the main

objections was that the Petitioner has no locus standi to institute and maintain

this application and that the Petitioner has suppressed and / or misrepresented

material facts which were within his knowledge.

On a perusal of the record we find that the 2nd Party Respondent-

Respondent Dayalan who was a director of Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd

ceased to be a director on 19June 2008. It was a contention of Ramboda Tea

Estate (Pvt) Ltd that the 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent was holding

possession of the said property on behalf of the Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt)

Ltd since he was a Director of the company and not in his personal capacity.

However after the death of the 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent Dayalan

his wife was substituted in her personal capacity. The said wife is not a

director of company and it was the contention of the 7th Party Respondent-

Respondent that the 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent's wife is now trying

to get hold of the remaining of the estate by using the order made by the

Learned Magistrate.

17

It was the position of the Substituted 2A Party Respondent-Respondent-

Petitioner and that the 7th Party Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner Ramboda

Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd for the first time in the High Court took up the position

that Dayalan possession is same as possession of Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt)

Ltd as he was a Director of the Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd.

On a perusal of the documents produced in this case in the Magistrate

Court namely the affidavit of the 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent Dayalan

has claimed the property in his personal capacity. He has stated that the said

property in accordance to the Company Act No. 17 of 1987 Nirmala

Wellasami, Waithyalingam Wellasami, Dayalan Waithyalingam Wellasmi,

Niranjan Waithyalingam Wellasami and Jayalakshmi Nagarathnam was

under the management and control of the said board of directors.

Thereafter by virtue of Deed No. 927 marked as 2 C) 1 and Gramasewa

certificate marked as 2 C) 2 and 2 C) 3 of the document marked by the duly

appointed board of directors and letter marked as 2 C) 4 issued by the Labour

Commissioner and the order in case no. 2487 and other document marked 2

C) 6 to 2 C) 11 that possession of the land was held by the 2nd Respondent-

Respondent Dayalan. Accordingly after the death of Dayalan we hold that

the Substituted 2A Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner also held the said

18

premises in her personal capacity. As such in we reject the view that the 2nd

Respondent has no locus standi to maintain this application. The application

of the Plaintiff for interim relief being supported ex-parte in the District

Court of Gampola made order issuing an Enjoining Order, Notice of Interim

Injunction and Summons to be served on the 2nd Defendant. The 2nd

Defendant had stated as he is aware no summons have been served on the 5th

Defendant. The 2nd Defendant Petitioner defendant by petition dated

23/02/2008 made under in terms of section 664(3) moved to have the

enjoining order set aside on the basis that the Plaintiff is wrongfully seeking

to dispossessed the 2nd Defendant from the land describe in 1 st to 11 th

schedule to the plaint. After supporting this application the court made a

bench order suspending the enjoining order issued forthwith and direct the

2nd Defendant to file objections. It was also submitted that the Plaintiff has

suppressed from court the judgment and decree entered in DC Gampola case

No 2487/2 the purported deed no. 927 dated 24/03/1992 marked as A20 upon

which the Plaintiff purportedly claims rights to the land describe aforesaid

has been declared null and void and no affect or force in law. The Plaintiff

suppressed from court that in terms of the judgment and decree entered in

DC Gampola case no 24871L, the purported power of Attorney dated

07/0211992 based on which the purported power of Attorney holder of the

owners ofthe land described in the 1 st to 11 th schedules to the plaint executed

the purported deed of transfer no. 927 has been declared null and void.

19

It was also submitted that the Plaintiff has suppressed to the court that at

the time of the execution of the purported agreement to sell no. 852 dated

12112/2007 marked A24 with the plaint Mrs. Nirmala Wellasami was in

prison. Hence it was submitted that purported agreement to sell is null and

void and no force or no avail in law and no right or claim whatsoever flows

from the said purported agreement to sell. The 2nd Defendant contended that

the Plaintiff is not in possession of the land describe as aforesaid.

The 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent-Appellant has taken up the position

that the Respondent has filed this revision application causing inordinate

delay and guilty of laches. On a perusal of the record we find that the Primary

Court Judge has given his order dated 03/02/2010.

The Officer in Charge of the Police Station of Kothmale had filed

information with the Magistrate of Helboda on 19111/2008. The Learned

Magistrate has delivered his order on 03/02/2010 the 1 st Party Respondent-

Petitioner-Respondent thereafter on or about 30108/2010 has filed a revision

application in the High Court of Kandy and the Learned High Court Judge

has delivered her order on 03/0212016. Thereafter the present application for

revision has been filed in the Court of Appeal on 26/02/2016. We find that

there is no inordinate delay in filing action in the Magistrate as well as in the

It l f

20

Appeal Court. Hence we reject this argument that there is an inordinate delay

by the Appellant to take steps in filing the present revision application has

been filed on 15th February 2016. The pt Party Respondent-Petitioner has

taken about 5 months to file the revision application in the High Court.

Therefore we find that there is no inordinate delay and the Respondent is not

guilty of laches.

Further it has been contended by the Appellant Respondent that number of

new documents which are not tendered to court has been filed of record that

there by application cannot be maintained. The Primary Court has given a

temporary order and this dispute should be referred to a competent

jurisdiction. When perusing the order dated 03/02/2016 the Learned High

Court Judge had stated that new material has been filed and by order of the

Primary Court Judge not having considered the decisions in the Civil cases

cited by the Petitioner and the statements and the police observations filed

before him in the interest of justice, that the High Court is of the view that

even if new material cited by the Petitioner, the Respondent had ample time

to challenge the said material before the High Court and that the Respondents

have failed to do so. However the Learned High Court Judge has not

indicated what the new material placed before court.

Further it was contended that there are exceptional grounds to invoke the

extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court. On a perusal of the revision

\

\. l fi,

21

application we find that there are exceptional circumstances which has been

pleaded by the Respondents-Petitioners.

We are ofthe view that the Respondent revision application has been filed

causing without inordinate delay and that there are exceptional grounds to

invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction has been pleaded in the petition of

appeal.

Further the 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent-Appellant has possessed this

land the courpus in his private capacity and not in the capacity as a director

of the company of Ram bod a Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd.

In the case of Oliver Millous of France V. M.H.A Haleem and others

reported in the Bar Association Law Journal 2001 Vol IX part 1 in the

Bar Association Law Report page 8 it was held that;

a) it is not the function of a Primary Court to go into the question of

legal title of the parties to the land in dispute in an application under

section 66 of the Primary Court's Procedure;

b) the central matter to be decided by the Primary Court is whether the

parties had possession of the land and had been forcibly

dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the

date on which information was filed under the section 66;

22

c) it is the apprehension of a breach of the peace and not infringement

of a private right or dispossession of any of the parties which

determines the jurisdiction of the Primary Court.

In this application the Petitioner among other relief is seeking to set aside

the order of the High Court of Kandy dated 03/02/2016 and to uphold the

order dated 03/02/2010.

The central matters to be decided by the Primary Court is whether the

Respondents had possession of the land and had been forcibly dispossessed

within a period of two months. Immediately before the date on which

information was filed under section 66. Besides it has been held that even a

squatter or a trespasser is entitled to possession if he had two months

possession prior to the date of filing information.

Vide the decision ofSharvananda ,J in Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah

(1982) 2 SLR 694 at page 698 where he observed that under section 68 the

Judge is bound to maintain the possession of such person even ifhe be a rank

trespasser as against any interference even by the rightful owner. This section

entitles even a squatter to the protection of law, unless his possession was

acquired within two months of the filing of the information.

23

Further in the case of Velupillai and others Vs. Sivanathan (1993) 1

SLR 123 it has been held that the scope of the inquiry under the special

jurisdiction (Primary Courts Procedure Act) is of a purely preventive and

provincial nature pending the final adjudication of the rights of the parties in

a Civil Court. The Magistrate is not involved in the investigation into title or

right to possession which is the function of a Civil Court.

Further the Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

preliminary issue that there was an absence of circumstances to warrant the

conclusion that there was a likelihood of a breach of the peace. In this case

the police had filed an information informing the Magistrate that there is a

dispute affecting land and a breach of the peace is threatened or likely then

the Primary Court will have jurisdiction to inquire into the matter. The Court

has to consider whether the dispute is such that it is likely to cause of breach

of the peace which the Primary Court Judge of Helboda has most correctly

looked into. It is the apprehension of a breach of the peace not any

infringement of a private right or dispossession of any of the parties which

determines the jurisdiction of the Primary Court Judge. It is sufficient for a

Primary Court Judge to exercise the powers under the section ifhe is satisfied

on the material on record that there is a present fear that there will be a breach

I of the peace stemming from the dispute unless proceedings are taken under ! I

the section. Primary Court Judge should however proceed with great caution

~ I

24

where there is no police report and the only material before him are the

statements of interested parties.

The Officer in Charge of the Police Station ofKothmale, the Complainant-

Respondent-Respondent filed information under section 66(1) ofthe Primary

Court Procedure Act on 1911112008 in the Primary Court of Gampola

(Helboda) in case No. 24799 citing the 1st Party Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondent, the deceased 2nd Party Respondent-Respondent in whose place

the Substituted 2A Party Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner was Substituted

and the 3rd Party Respondent-Respondent-Respondent. Thereafter the 4th, 5th,

6th,7th and 8th Party Respondents intervened in the said case. The said Parties

except the 1 st Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent were in possession of

separate lots of the Ramboda Estate which is in extent about 837 acres for

many years as owners thereof. The pt Party Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondent claimed title to the said estate and! or part thereof. Thereafter all

parties filed their respective counter affidavits with documents and their

respective written submissions. The Learned Magistrate of Helboda

delivered her order on 03/02/2010 holding that the parties aforesaid are

entitle to possession of the aforesaid extents of the said estate.

Thereafter lapse of 8 months or so the pt Party Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondent sought to revise the said order dated 30108/2010 by producing

25

numerous documents, which were not a part of the Primary Court

proceedings. The Parties filed their respective objections to the said

application praying that the application be dismissed for the reasons set out

therein. The pt Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent filed his counter

objections and all parties filed their respective written submissions.

The Learned Judge of the High Court delivered her order on 03/02/2016

allowing the said revision application and has granted possession of the

entire estate to the pt Party Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent contrary to

the facts established by evidence.

In the order ofthe Learned High Court Judge she has not given any reasons

whether there is a breach of peace or likelihood of breach of peace. As

regards possession the Learned High Court Judge had only indicated that it

is observed that the possession had been prior to the institution of the

66 application.

However, she has stated that the Primary Court Judge had failed to consider

the long and continued possession through out of the Substituted 2A

Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner and the other Respondents in delivering

the said judgment.

According to law fresh evidence could be brought before the High Court

by a party. However the High Court Judge has not indicated the new material

26

that was before her. The Respondents-Respondent-Petitioners had been in

possession of the said estate. The Learned High Court Judge has not

considered whether there is a breach of peace or likelihood of breach of

peace. When she had granted the possession of the entire estate amounting

the 837 acres to the 1 st Party Respondent-Petitioner which in law a person is

not entitle to possess.

Accordingly we are of the view that the order of the Leamed High Court

Judge is erroneous and cannot stand. Hence we set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge dated 03/02/2016 and uphold the order of the

Learned Magistrate as there is breach of peace and likelihood of breach of

peace and the Substituted 2A Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner and Jth

Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner had been in possession of the portion of

the estate.

Accordingly appeal is allowed with costs ofRs.25,0001- each.
