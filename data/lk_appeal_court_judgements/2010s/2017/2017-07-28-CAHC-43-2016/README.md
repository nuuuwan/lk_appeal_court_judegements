The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of Puttalam

under section 362 (2) e of the Penal Code. He was convicted after trial

and sentenced to 10 years RI and a fine of Rs. 5,0001= with a default term

of six month RI was ordered. He was ordered to pay Rs. 1,00,0001= as

compensation to the victim with a default term of 2 years.

The prosecutrix has been sixteen years of age and a minor when

the incident took place. She has been living with her boy friend and has

been six months pregnant, according to medical evidence.

The appellant who was the Grama Sevaka of the area has visited

the prosecutrix and has asked her to come to his office to sign some

2

papers in order to obtain a loan to construct a house. With permission

from her partner she has gone to the Grama Sewaka's office on a

Saturday to sign the forms. The appellant is alleged to have raped her on

a chair which was kept in his office. The prosecutrix has told her partner

about this two days after the incident. Thereafter a complaint was made

by an aunt to the child protection authority and subsequently the local

police has recorded her statement and proceeded to arrest the accused.

The grounds of appeal urged by the appellant are that the

complaint was belated and the version of the prosecution was not

probable. He also stated that the contradictions per - se and inter - se

have not been considered by the learned High Court Judge. He also

stated that the evidence placed before court has not been properly

analysed.

The evidence of the prosecutrix and the aunt reveals that the

prosecutrix's partner used to assault her when they had arguments

therefore fearing his wrath she has kept silent until he questioned her.

This explains why she kept silent for two days. It was held in Ajith

Samarakoon Vs The Republic 2004 2 SLR 2009 if the delay can be

explained the court can act upon such evidence.

On the argument of probability as argued by the appellant's learned

President Counsel there had been no enmity among the parties and the

prosecutrix and her partner who were living together would not have

wanted to involve in a dispute with the Grama Sewaka. The prosecutrix's

partner had already been prosecuted for having sexual intercourse with

a minor.

The learned counsel argued the act of rape would not have been

prossible on a chair. The Doctor while giving evidence has testified under

cross examination that it is possible to have taken place on a chair. The

counsel for the appellant argued that the Grama Sewaka's office is

situated next to other officers and that it is not probable to rape a person

in such an environment which we fined is not correct. There is no

evidence to suggest that the office of the Grama Sewaka was in an open

area. The Samurdhi Officer who has given evidence on behalf of the

defence has admitted his office which is next door is in an enclosed area.

Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance states;

NO fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters

before it, the court either believes it to exist of considers its

existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the

4

circumstances oj the particular case, to act upon the

supposition that it exists".

We find that the prosecutrix has testified on two occasions namely

on 28/01/2014 and on 07/07/2015 and she has narrated the main incident

without any contradictions. There are minor contradiction with regard to

the appellant's visit to the house which do not go to the root of the case

as stated by the learned High Court Judge.

For the afore stated reasons I find that the learned High Court

Judge has given a well considered judgment after evaluating the

evidence. I affirm the judgment given on 30105/2016.

The appeal is dismissed.
