JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Respondent - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Respondent) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court of the

North Western Province holden in Kurunegala praying for a writ of

Certiorari to quash the decision of the Respondent - Appellants (hereinafter

, . sometimes referred to as the Appellants) to evict the Respondent from the

premises relevant to this case.

The Respondent admittedly had entered in to a contract with the

Appellants to carry on a business of running a canteen situated in the

building, which has housed the Polgahawela Bus Stand. 1

A dispute between the Respondent and the Appellants had arisen over the

rent chargeable by the Appellant for the said canteen premises.

The Respondent had instituted the case No. 71125/L in the District Court of

Kurunegala in the year 2007 regarding the said impugned premises.

However, it has transpired that the learned District Judge had refused to

grant the interim relief the Respondent had prayed for in that case. The

Respondent had thereafter withdrawn the said District Court case.

It appears that it was at that stage that the Respondent had chosen to

obtain a ban, to prevent her being evicted from the impugned premises by

way of a writ of certiorari. It has become impossible, due to the impugned

judgment of the Provincial High Court, for the Appellants to take any action

against the Respondent. This is despite the fact that the Respondent

continues to enjoy the possesson carrying on her private business in a

1 Paragraph 2 & 3 of the application filed in the Provincial High Court by the Respondent.

premises built and maintained by public funds while not paying a cent as

rental. It is not disputed that the Respondent had not paid up to now, the

sum payable by her to the Appellant. This is despite the fact that the 18

months period reckoned from 2011-06-06, the date of the letter produced

marked @a 6 by the Respondent, has long passed. Indeed this is the

letter, which formed the very foundation of the case for the Respondent.

Learned counsel for the Respondent on being inquired by this Court

confirmed that the sum payable to the Appellant by the Respondent in

terms of @a 6 has not been paid up until now. It would be difficult for any

Court to condone such a state of affairs and it is indeed a quite regrettable

state of affairs. Mockery of the issuance of the writ of certiorari by the

Provincial High Court is that no course of action has been left to the

Appellants. As a result, they cannot either recover the rent due to them or

take back their own property from the Respondent. This is despite the fact

that the Respondent does not have any right either legal or moral, to

remain in that premises.

Perusal of the material adduced by parties and the judgment dated 2012-

03-15 pronounced by the learned Provincial High Court Judge shows that it

is a common ground that rights and obligations of parties in the instant

case are purely contractual.

The Appellant had raised that issue before the Provincial High Court as an

objection to the exercise of writ jurisdiction. Unfortunately learned

Provincial High Court Judge has failed to appreciate the importance of that

point. He appear to have misunderstood the law pertaining to this issue as

well as the concept of legitimate expectation.

This Court is of the view that the 'legitimate expectation' which the learned

Provincial High Court Judge has referred to, must be seen only as an offer

subject to certain condition2 and not as a legitimate expectation. It remains

as an option given to the Respondent and it is the Respondent who should

choose to fulfil the conditions attached to it.

In any event the Appellant being a Pradeshiya Sabha, will have to follow

necessary tender procedures etc. before it could lawfully permit anyone to

occupy the impugned premises which is a building maintained at the

expense of public funds.

There is no legal duty cast on the Appellants to allocate the impugned

premises to the Respondent in the said bus stand.

Further, an expectation whose fulfillment requires that a decision maker

should make an unlawful decision cannot be a legitimate expectation. Thus,

it is necessary that the fulfillment of the legitimate expectation, breach of

which is complained of, must be within the powers of the relevant public

authority.

In the case of Wannigama V The Incorporated Council of Legal Education

and 16 others3, the Supreme Court held that an applicant in a writ application

cannot rely upon a legitimate expectation unless such expectation is founded

upon either a promise or an established practice.

Thus, the Respondent had not established before court that the Appellant

had given her a legitimate expectation.

The document marked @a 3 is merely a contractual agreement between

the Chairman of the Pradeshiya Sabha and the Respondent. It stands as a

commercial transaction between them. The Respondent by letter produced

marked e) G 6 had requested for more time, namely two weeks, to pay the

amount of money payable by her to the Appellants. The letter produced

32007 Bar Association Law Reports 54.

8

marked @a 8 is clearly a reply to the above letter, sent by the Respondent

granting the very request made by her. It is the receipt of the said letter

dated 20111-07-06 produced marked @a 8, which had prompted the

Respondent to seek a writ of certiorari from the Provincial High Court.

As has been mentioned before, it is clear that the Respondent, for the

reasons best known to her, had decided to discontinue the District Court

case.

Writ jurisdiction of this court would be exercised at the discretion of court.

One main requisite condition is that the Petitioner must come to court with

clean hands. It is also necessary that the right such Petitioner asks Court to

protect in writ proceeding must be a legally protectable right.

The relationship between the Appellants and the Respondent in the instant

case is purely contractual. That contract is commercial in nature. The

Respondent has failed to prove any arbitrary action on the part of the

Appellants. Besides, an undue advantage has been accrued to the

Respondent by the impugned issuance of the writ.

The circumstances set out above, convince this Court that the application

to the Provincial High Court for a writ of certiorari is misconceived in law

and that the Respondent has filed this application for ulterior motives.

Despite the undertaking by the learned counsel for the Respondent to file

written submission in this Court by 2017-09-22, the said undertaking was

observed in the breach. Thus, this Court has no alternative but to conclude

that the Respondent has no ground to be placed before this Court on his

behalf, for its consideration. Therefore, this Court has to proceed on the

basis that there indeed exists not a single ground in favour of the

Respondent. Resultant position would be for this Court to conclude that it

should allow this appeal.

If this court does not set aside, the judgment of the Provincial High Court

issuing a writ of Certiorari referred to above (which issuance is illegal), all

what this court does would be facilitating the continuance of an illegal activity

unabated.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to allow the appeal and set

aside the judgment of the learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 2012-

03-15.

The Respondent has abused the writ jurisdiction of Provincial High Court to

gain a personal benefit, which she is not entitled to obtain in law. She, in

the course of that process has made the system of administration of justice

.

of this country a mockery. The rule of law demands that a clear message

should be sent to the Respondent as well as to the others who would dare

to engage in that kind of practices. Hence this Court decides to direct the

Respondent to pay to the 2nd Appellant a cost in a sum of Rs. 300,000/=. I i ! t r
