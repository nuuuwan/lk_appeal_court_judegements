After trial, the Learned High Court Judge convicted the appellant on both counts and imposed 7 years RI with a fine of Rs. 2,000/- carrying a default term of three months each. This appeal is from the said conviction and the sentence.

The story of the prosecution is that on the day in question the victim (who was 11 years at the time of the incident) has played cr~cket with the appellant, and as the ball went missing the victim has gOlle with appellant to bring another ball. When the victim was sitting in the verandah of the appellant's house, the appellant has taken the victim to a room gagged him and tied his hands to a bed post. Thereafter the appellant had inserted his penis into the anus of the victim after removing cloths of both parties. The victim testifies that he was threatened by the appellant not to disclose this incident to anyone.

The victim says that the appellant committed the same act a few days after the first incident at the appellant's house. The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the date of offence is not specified and therefore it is difficult for the appellant to answer the first charge.

The learned counsel further argued that it is difficult to answer the second charge as well and more difficult to form a defence.

To strengthen the appellant's argument he cited the judgment in case No. CA 01/2013 decided on 31.01.2014. The appellant's argument was that the date of offence had not been established by the prosecution.

It was revealed in evidence that the victim was threatened by the appellant not to tell anyone and further the appellant has not divulged the incident to his parents fearing that they will punish him. Moreover the victim's mother

has come to know of the incident from a third party and the first complaint was made on the 02.08.2008.

The Learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that the charges were framed in terms of Section 174 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act and are not defective. The said Section provides thus,

"When a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the.first to the last of such offences he may be charged with and tried at one trial for any number of them not exceeding three, and in trials before the High Court such charges may be included in one and the same indictment."

The victim testifies in his evidence on a leading question posed by the state counsel that the incident took place in August 2007. It appears the Learned High Court Judge has allowed the above question under Section 142 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Section 142 of the Evidence Ordinance provides thus;

"Leading questions must not, if objected to by the adverse party, be asked in an examination-in-chief or in a re-examination, except with permission of the court" .

Since the prosecution has established that the offence was committed during the period referred to in the indictment and the victim whilst giving evidence, states that these incidents happened during the month of August 2007, the above argument has no merit.

The JMO has observed a healed tear in the anus at 6 0' clock position which has been caused due to penetration.

The learned DSG submitted that the medical evidence corroborates with the victim IS evidence and therefore there is no reason to disbelieve the version of the prosecution.

We find that his evidence meets the test of probability. The victim has explained the delay in making the complaint, and the explanation given is plausible.

For the aforestated reasons we see no basis to set-aside the j~dgment dated

15.12.2016 and accordingly we affirm the impugned judgment and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
