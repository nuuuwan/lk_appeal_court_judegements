DECIDED ON: 30.11.2016.

Vijith K. Malalgoda, P.C. J. (PICA)

Heard learned Counsel for the Petitioner and learned State Counsel

representing the respondent. The petitioner to the present application has come

before this Court seeking a writ of certiorari quashing a decision of the 3rd

respondent granting the license with regard to a State land to the 5th to 7th

respondents. As revealed before this Court the two petitioners submitted that they

were in occupation of a State land for a long period of time but made an application

to regularize the said land only in the year 2015. In support of his position he

submits marked A2 a report from the Grama Niladhari of Hinguruwelpitiya dated

22.12.2015. However, it is evident before this Court that when a quit notice was

served on the petitioner in order to evict him from the said land in the year 2015

January the 1st petitioner had gone before Court on 28.02.2014 and agreed to vacate

the premises. Accordingly, the Magistrate had issued the quit notice. It is further

observed by this Court that a valid permit had been issued in the name of 5th

respondent on 19.07.2013 subsequent to a Land Katchcheri. After the petitioner left

the premises the said Winifreeda had taken possession of the said land and the

i

,

\t

petitioners complained before this Court that the said Winifreeda had taken steps

to cut several teak trees planted by him. However, we observed that the petitioner

who has gone before the Magistrate Court in the year 2014 and agreed to vacate the

premises forthwith and now after two and half years come before this Court seeking

relief prayed for by them. The petitioner failed to explain the delay in coming before

this Court. The 1 st petitioner himself had gone before the Magistrate and agreed to

vacate the premises. He has not gone before a Land Katchcheri and asked for the

grant for the land said to have developed by him.

Under these circumstances, we see no merit in the application preferred by the

petitioner before us and therefore, we are not inclined to issue notices at this juncture.

Notices are refused. No cost is ordered.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.

S. Thurairaja, (PC) J. I agree.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL.
