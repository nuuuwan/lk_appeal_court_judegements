Being aggrieved by the said judgment the instant appeal was preferred by the

Plaintiff by Petition of Appeal dated 18.01.2000.

In summary the contention of the parties are as follows;

The Plaintiff contends that her father W. Benedict Fernando was the lawful owner

of the land described in the 1 st Schedule to the Plaint. The said title derives from

Deed bearing No. 1222 dated 20.01.1937 prepared by M.LI de SI Karunathilaka

Notary Public. The Father of the Plaintiff has then gifted a divided portion of the

land, as depicted in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint, to the Plaintiff by virtue of Deed

bearing No. 8764 dated 29.02.1988 prepared by H. P. Perera Notary Public.

Further the Appellant pleads prescription over the corpus.

The Defendant Contends that the land described in the 2nd Schedule to the Plaint

was not a part of the land which is described in the 1 st Schedule to the Plaint and

further that the land described in the 1 st Schedule to the Plaint formed a part of the

land described in the 1 st Schedule to the Answer.

As contended by the Defendant her grandmother, Motherlena Fernando was the

lawful owner of the land described in the 1 st Schedule to the Answer which was in

extent one acre. The said Motherlena Fernando had gifted 2/3 share to her son the

aforementioned W. Benedict Fernando (the father of the Plaintiff) and the

remaining 1/3 has been gifted to her daughter Victoria Fernando (the Defendant's

mother) by Deed bearing No. 1223 dated 20.01.1937. The said Victoria Fernando

by deed bearing No. 1650 dated 23.06.1980 prepared by A. M. Fernando Notary

Public had gifted the said share to the Defendant. The Defendant further pleads

prescription over the said share.

It is pertinent to note that the Defendant was received an order in her favour on a

determination under Section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act and therefore

was in possession of the corpus.

The co - owners of the entire land had prepared a plan bearing No. 2062 dated

01.09.1984 prepared by S. Samaratunga Licensed Surveyor. As the learned District

Judge has correctly identified the main issue in the instant case is whether Lot 7 as

depicted in the said plan is a divided portion of the 2/3 share claimed by the

Plaintiff or whether it represents the 1/3 share claimed by the Defendant. Parties

admit that Lot 7 is the subject of this action.

The aforesaid Deeds bearing Nos. 1222 and 1223 by which 2/3 share and 1/3 share

devolved on to the father of the Plaintiff and the mother of the Defendant

respectively are not contested by the parties. Further the parties agree that the 2/3

share of the Plaintiff and the 1/3 share of the Defendant are described in Deed Nos.

1222 and 1223 respectively.

As correctly evaluated by the learned District Judge the Eastern boundary of the

land described in Deed No. 1223 refers to "2/3 share of this land" and the Western

boundary of the land described in Deed No. 1222 refers to "1/3 share of this land".

Further, as per the description contained in Deed No. 1223 the Western Boundary

of the 113 share of the Defendant which land is subject to this action is "dewata

para". It is clear therefore that the 113 share of the entire land, i. e. the corpus is

6

situated east of the "dewata para" and as such, the contention of the Plaintiff that

the said land is situated west of the "dewata para" cannot hold. This was also the

view taken by the learned District Court Judge.

The learned Counsel for the Defendant further submits that according'to document

marked PI the Western Boundary of the Plaintiffs 2/3 share is not "dewata para"

but as aforementioned it refers to "113 share of this land", the learned District

Judge has carefully evaluated this position and had held with the Defendant.

Therefore, the learned District Judge was correct to find that at the time Deed

bearing No. 8764 dated 29.02.1988 prepared by H. P. Perera Notary Public was

executed in respect of Lot. 7 mentioned above, the Plaintiff s father had no title to

pass on to the Plaintiff since Lot. 7 aforementioned, now identified as the 1/3 share

of the Defendant was gifted to the Defendant's mother by Deed bearing No. 1223

dated 20.01.1937 and in tum she gifted the said land to the Defendant by Deed

bearing No. 1650 dated 23.06.1980 prepared by A. M. Fernando Notary Public.

The Counsel for the Appellant submits that Plan marked as P6 bearing No. 5804

dated 22.09.1959 prepared by Licensed Surveyor W. F. Warnakulasuriya, which

was prepared in respect of District Court of Chilaw case bearing No. 4364 (P5),

depicts a roadway between the land of the Mother of the Defendant and the Father

of the Plaintiff. Learned Counsel submits that therefore 113 share of the land

claimed by the Defendant is found at the Western side of this road way.

However the learned Counsel for the Defendant argues that the land at the Western

side of this road way is a different land which belongs to the Defendant called

f I I1 t , l f

~

7

"ketakelagaha watte" to which her mother got title via the aforementioned Deed

bearing No. 1223 and same has been described in the 1st Schedule therein. The

Eastern Boundary of the said "ketakelagaha watte" is described in the said Deed as

been "dewata para" and therefore is not the 1/3 share claimed by the Defendant.

In any event the said Plan marked as P6 bearing No. 5804 dated 22.09.1959

describes the land east of the roadway as belonging to both the Mother of the

Defendant and the Father of the Plaintiff. In evidence when the Plaintiff was

questioned whether both the Mother of the Defendant and the Father of the

Plaintiff owned the said land she had no Answer.

The learned District Judge has considered all the evidence carefully relating to the

identity and pedigree of the Corpus and has held in favour of the Defendant.

F or the reasons more fully described above and in light of the meticulous reasoning

presented by the learned District Judge this Court finds no reason to disturh the

findings of the original Court. Therefore this Appeal is dismissed without costs:

Appeal Dismissed.
