M.M.A. GAFFOOR J

This is a final appeal preferred against the order of the learned

District Judge of Tangalle in Case No.1631 jPartition. Both parties have

tendered written submissions in support of their contentions.

The bone of contention in this matter pertains to a Deed of

Transfer marked by the defendant as P2. The defendant's main issue was

that Deed No.13189 had been executed when he was mentally ill and that

act lead to deceive the defendant. It is elicited in evidence that the

defendant was mentally ill and he had been taking treatments in the

mental hospital, Angoda. The position in this respect as urged by the

plaintiff-respondent is that the 1 st defendant had not been adjudicated a

lunatic. In order to substantiate this position provisions of the Civil

Procedure Code Chapter 39 had been cited.

The 1 st defendant had given evidence in Court and the learned

District Judge was in a position to observe the demeanor of the said

defendant before the original Court.

5

It was held in the judgments of Fredd v. Brown and Company (18 NLR

302) which was followed in De Silva and Others v. Seneviratna and

Another (1981 (2) SLR 7), Alwis v. Piyasena Fernando (1993 (1) SLR

119), Dharmathilake Thera v. Buddharakkith Thera (1990 (1) SLR

211).

The learned Counsel for the plaintiff-respondent has cited a

case bearing No. CA Appeal 509/97(F) decided on 17.06.2016. A careful

consideration of that appeal will show that the person in question in that

case was declared a lunatic by a competent court. Therefore, the above

case does not come within the four corners of this case and therefore has

to be distinguished in reference to the case in point.

One of the contentions of the defendant-appellant was that

Deed marked P2 had not been proved to the satisfaction of Section 68 of

the Evidence Ordinance. It should be noted that the said deed had been

marked and the plaintiffs case had been closed marking documents PI to

P9 (page 68 of the Appeal Brief) When these documents were marked and

the case was concluded for the plaintiff the defendant had not taken any

objection as regards to the deed in question P2. Therefore, according to

the law if a document had not been challenged at the conclusion of the

plaintiffs case it is presumed that it has to be taken in evidence as proved.

,

(Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another vs. JogoZinja - 1981 (1) SLR

18) Therefore, non proof of the deed in question cannot be contested as

an issue in this case. Gamini Amarathunga J in Samarakoon vs.

Gunasekera and another 2011 (1) SLR 149 observed that,

"(3) When a document is admitted subject to proof, the party

tendering it in evidence is obliged to formally prove it by calling the

evidence necessary to prove the document according to law. If such

evidence is not called and if no objection is taken to the document

when it is read in evidence at the time of closing the case of the party

who tendered the document it becomes evidence in the case.

(4) On the other hand if the document is objected to at the time

when it is read in evidence before closing the case of the party who

tendered the document in evidence, the document cannot be used

as evidence for the party tendering it."

In light of the above decision of the Supreme Court the document marked

subject to proof as P2 cannot be contested now.

The case of Hameed vs. Marikkar (52 NLR) 269 and Amarasekera vs.

Jayanetti - 64 CLW 17 demonstrate that under our law a transaction

entered during a lucid interval of a mental patient is valid.

In the above case of Hameed the Supreme Court had held that,

"A contract of a lunatic while the adjudication of lunacy remains

unreserved would be valid if it can be shown that at the time he

entered into the contract he was of sound mind and understood the

nature of the transaction."

7

It is also pertinent to refer to the Supreme Court case of Amarasekera vs.

Jayanetti 64 CLW 17 where T.S. Fernando J. held thus,

"The question that arises upon this appeal is whether an alienation

of land executed, during a lucid interval by a person who has been

adjudicated by the District Court to be of unsound mind and

incapable of managing his affairs, void where the execution has

taken place while the adjudication remains unreserved."

In the above circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with the

judgment of the learned District Judge. Hence, the deed in question P2

has been proved executed properly by the defendant. The partition action

can proceed on the basis of these findings. Hence, the appeal is dismissed

without costs.
