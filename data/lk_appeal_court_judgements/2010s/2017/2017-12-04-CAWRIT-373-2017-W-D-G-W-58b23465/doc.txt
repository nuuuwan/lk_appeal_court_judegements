The petitioners are seeking to quash the Gazette notification issued

by the 1 st Respondent, the Minister of Local government dated

3

17.02.2017 No. 2006/44 marked P3 on the basis that it is ultra vires. The

Petitioners contention is that the Minister appointed committee under

section 3D of the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No. 22

of 2012 has no authority to recommend to the Minister to alter the

number of members for each ward of the Local Authority and the

Minister has no power to issue such Gazette emending the number of

members allotted to each ward.

The Attorney General first appeared on notice as amicus curiae and

later representing the 1 st and 2nd Respondents raised several preliminary

objections. Firstly delay, secondly not naming the relevant parties i.e. the

Election Commission, thirdly misrepresentation of material facts and

fourthly on locus standi. He further submitted that the alteration of the

number of the members for each ward is an incidental matter to the

alteration to the boundaries of the wards where the wards become larger

or smaller with the alteration of the boundaries and sometimes new wards

have been created and therefore the alteration of the number of the

members allocated to each ward is an incidental matter to the alteration to

the boundaries. His contention is the power to alter the boundaries

includes the power to alter the number of members allocated for each

ward. Further he submits that the alteration of the number of members

allocated to wards is done only in about 2.5% of the wards out of more

than 4000 wards.

Several parties moved to intervene in to this application on the

basis that they are affected parties. They are political parties, civil rights

movements, and intended candidates.

The Local Authorities Election (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 2012

has introduced a new Part named as Part 1 to the Principle Act, the Local

Authorities Election Ordinance last amended by Act No. 14 of 2002

4

(hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Ordinance)

facilitating re demarcation of the wards in Local Authorities.

Under section 3A of the Ordinance the Minister was empowered to

establish a National Delimitation Committee. (National Committee) The

section 3B mandated the National Committee to make the

recommendations to the Minister for the division of each local authority

area into wards, determine the boundaries, and assign a name and a

number to each ward. Subsection (2) provides the requirements that have

to be taken into consideration by the National Committee in doing so.

Subsection (3) mandates that the National Committee with the power to

recommend the creation of a multi member ward or wards for any local

authority area. Under subsection (5) the National Committee is required

to submit the report on its recommendations to the Minister.

The subsection 3C (1) makes it mandatory for the Minister to

submit the report to the President forthwith. Thereafter subsection (2)

makes it an obligation of the President to publish an order in the Gazette

indicating;

I. Number of wards,

II. The boundaries,

III. Names,

IV. Number,

V. Alphabetical letter in English assigned to each ward,

in respect of each local authority.

If the National Committee has recommended the creation of multi

member wards, then the President has to publish in the same Gazette the

following details too.

I. The name,

,

f

l I i

f ! I! t f r i

f I l f

II. The number or the alphabetical letter assigned to each

such multi member ward

III. The name of the respective local authority,

IV. The total number of members to be elected to each

multi member ward.

Section 3D (1) of the Amendment Act grants the authority to the

Minister to cause alterations to the boundaries of the wards in the order

published in the Gazette under section 3C. These alterations can be made

only on the recommendation of a committee that has to be appointed by

the Minister under that subsection. The requirements that have to be taken

into consideration by this committee in making their recommendation to

alter the boundaries are the same as the requirements that had to be taken

into consideration by the National Committee. Subsection (2) requires the

alterations recommended by the committee to be published in the Gazette

by the Minister. The only alterations that can be made under this section

are specified as alterations on;

I. Boundaries,

II. Names,

III. Numbers or letters of each ward.

Under sections 3A to 3C the National Committee was empowered

to make recommendations in creation of multi member wards and the

President has to publish an order in the Gazette to that effect. The

Legislature, in its wisdom, has taken away the power of creating multi

member wards/changing multi member wards into single member wards

from the Minister. The committee appointed by the Minister under

section 3D (1) is not empowered to make any such recommendations too.

Any recommendation made exceeding the power or authority granted to

the committee appointed under section 3D or any publication made on

such recommendation is ultra vires.

The learned DSG for the Respondents submitted, referring to Wade

and Forsyth on Administrative Law, Tenth Edition page 179 where it is

stated that, "A statutory power will be construed as impliedly authorizing

everything which can fairly be regarded as incidental or consequential to

the power itself; and this doctrine is not applied narrowly" and argues

that changing a multi member ward into a single member ware and vise

versa is incidental to the alteration of the boundaries. He further submits

that with the alteration of the boundaries, new wards have been created

and unless the number of members allocated to each ward is changed,

there is no way to allocate a member to such new wards.

The Legislature has clearly indicated its intention In the

Amendment Act. The section 3B (3) has given the power or authority of

creating wards in the local authority area to the National Committee. The

National Committee was further entrusted with the authority to

recommend creating multi member wards. The Legislature has purposely

taken away that power from the Minister appointed committee under

section 3D. That committee was entrusted only with the power to

recommend the alteration of boundaries, names, and the number or the

letter of a ward. Therefore the Minister or the committee appointed by the

Minister under section 3D, cannot acquire an authority or power which

has been kept away from it by the Legislature, on the pretext of it being

incidental to alteration of boundaries. It goes beyond the alteration of

boundaries. Creating new wards and altering the number of members

allocated to wards are matters that are not within the purview of the

Minister or Minister appointed committee under section 3D. It is the

power given to the National Committee and only the National Committee

j ! r f II

f

can make recommendations to that effect. Publishing an order on the

recommendations of the National Committee is vested with the President.

The Minister was given a very limited power or mandate in changing the

Gazette published by the President under section 3C.

The Minister or the committee appointed by the Minister derives

authority to alter the boundaries from the statue and therefore the words

of the statue that are giving the authority controls the function of the

Minister.

The Minister III publishing the Gazette marked P3 stated as

follows;

"BY virtue of powers vested in me, by section 3D of the Local

authorities Elections Ordinance (Chapter 262), 1, ........... do by this

order amend the orders published in the Gazatte Extra Ordinary No.

1928126 of 2Ft August 2015 by amending boundaries, number of

members and constituent parts of wards ... ............ "

The Minister acted under section 3D of the Ordinance and altered

the number of the members allocated to wards by the President under

section 3C which is ultra vires.

The learned DSG raised several preliminary objections. One of the

said objections is delay. The impugned Gazette was published on

17.02.2017 and the application was filed on 10.11 2017. The Counsel

submits that it is a delay and relies on several authorities of this Court as

well as of the Supreme Court. In an application for a prerogative writ the

petitioners have to seek remedy expeditiously. But if the Gazette itself is

a nullity, the delay will not make it valid. On the other hand the learned

DSG submits that the Election Commission has issued a press release on

01.11.2017 that the Minister had informed the Commission on

8

01.11.2017 that the Guzette indicating the number of members of the

local authorities has been published. If the Election Commission was

unaware of the Gazette until it was informed the Respondents cannot

complain that the Petitioners are late.

The locus standi of the Petitioners is also challenged by the learned

DSG. The Petitioners are citizens of this country and are eligible voters in

the local government elections. Conducting election on an invalid Gazette

is a matter that will affect the rights of any citizen. The learned DSG

further submits that the Petitioners have failed to name the Election

Commission as a party. The Election Commission has not yet called for

nomination for the local authorities' election. The Commission had issued

a press release that it intends to do so. Until the Commission triggered

off the election by calling for nominations, the intention of the

Commission will not make them a necessary party. The non disclosure of

the said press release cannot be considered as a misrepresentation. It

discloses only the intention of the Commission to hold the election.

The Petitioners have established a strong case with high probability

of winning. It is obvious that if the interim order is not granted, the

application will become nugatory.

Any order suspending the operation of the Gazette may delay the

election process. The Court has to weigh such a delay with holding

election on a Gazette on the face of it is ultra vires and a nullity. The

entire election will be a nullity if it is held under an invalid Gazette.

Therefore the Court is cf the view that the balance of convenience lies in

favour of the Petitioners.

It has been held in the case of Duwearatchi and another V. Vincent

Perera and others [1984] 2 Sri L R 94 that;

9

(1) An interim stay order in a writ application is an incidental

order made in the exercise of the inherent or implied powers of the Court.

The Court should be guided by the following principles

(i) Will the final order be rendered nugatory if the petitioner.

is successful?

(ii) Where does the balance of convenience lie ?

(iii) Will irreparable and irremediable mischief or injury be

caused to either party?

In the case of [1996] 1 Sri L R 364 Mahindasoma V. Hon.

Maithripala Senanayake and others it has been held again that;

(1) That the Court will be guided inter alia, by the following

principles, in granting interim relief

(a) Will the final order be rendered nugatory if the petitioner

is successful?

(b) Where does the balance of convenience lie?

As I pointed out above, the Petitioners have established a strong

case with a probability of winning and that the balance of convenience

lies in favour of the Petitioners. Further it is established that if the interim

order is not issued, the application will be nugatory.

Several intervenient petitioners moved permission to intervene in

this application. The Court heard their respective cases. We are of the

view that these applications have to be considered only after giving the

Petitioners also a hearing. The said intervenient petitioners are mostly

political parties, intended candidate, civil right movements and citizens.

Increasing the number of intervenient petitioners will not bend the

balance of convenience towards them.

10

I hold that an interim order as prayed for in paragraph (f) of the

prayer to the petition be issued subject to the following variation.

The Court is mindful of the fact that the franchise of the people

should be protected. Therefore the Court does not intend to issue an

interim order until the final determination of this case. The interim order

is issued until the next day of hearing to enable the Court to re asses the

necessity of extending the interim order.

Issue interim order as prayed for in the paragraph (f) of the prayer

to the petition to be operative until the next day of hearing.

Issue notice on the Respondents.
