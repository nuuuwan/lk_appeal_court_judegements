Order S.Thurairaja PC J

The Petitioner joined as a Trainee technician grade B3 of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation

in 1984 and gradually rose to the position of instrument superintendent grade A7.

The present dispute is that there was an internal circular/ advertisement under the

reference number of HR/E/13/035(Cf)/ (@)/035(C) marked as P14 by the Petitioner. Where it was advertised for several positions including Assistant Manager grade AS required

qualifications was among other things an employee of CPC at grade 7 with ...... or NDT with 6

years' service or .......

CA (Writ) 437/2014 Page 2 of 5

The Petitioner claims that she had necessary qualifications and experience hence she

applied to the said post and was selected and informed that she will be placed at grade 6 for

one year and after completion of one year with recommendation of HOF will be promoted

to grade AS. The Petitioner by letter dated 08/04/2013 (PI6) while not accepting the

promotion she requested her to be placed at grade 5.

Petitioner seeks the following reliefs from the court:

1. Writ of Mandamus to place her at grade 5 from 27th March 2013 and to provide all

allowances and benefits since that day.

2. Issue a Writ of Certiorari quashing the second inherent notice marked P22 at P26.

The Respondents takes up legal objection to the maintainability of this application stating

that the relationship between the Petitioner and Respondents are purely of contractual

nature namely Contract of employment hence the Petitioner is not entitled for Writ of

Mandamus.

Further the Respondent submits that there is an undue delay by the Petitioner to seek the

I remedy hence the Petitioner is liable for laches

Respondent also submits that considering all facts of the petition does not qualify to obtain

writs as she prayed for.

Now I consider the 1st legal objection, it is accepted by both parties that the Petitioner is an

employee attached to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, since 3rd September 1985 and

presently she holds a position of instrumental Superintendent grade A7. Respondent is a

government establishment established by Parliamentary statute. The relationship between

the Petitioner and Respondent is in the nature of Employer - Employee. The question is to

decide whether the Respondent was doing a public duty or not. If the Respondent is

performing a public duty the Petitioner will be entitled for Writ of Mandamus subject to

other conditions a~ fulfilled, if not this application will fail.

In Ratnayake V Perera 2 SLR 451 the court held that lithe general rule of mandamus is that its function is to compel s- public authority to do its duty. The essence of mandamus is that it is a command issued by a superior court for the performance of a public authority of a public legal duty. It is only granted to compel the performance of duties of a public nature, and not merely of private character, that is to say, for the enforcement of a mere private right stemming fram a contract of the parties."

In Weligama Multi Purpose Co-operative society V Chandradasa Daluwatta 1984 1

SLR 195 courts held that "Mandamus lies to secure the performance of a public duty, in the performance of which an applicant has sufficient legal interest. To be enforceable by Mandamus the duty to be performed must be of a public nature and not of a merely private character. A Dublic duty imposed by statute, charter the common law or custom."

CA (Writ) 437/2014 Page 3 of 5

H.W.Wade & C.F.Forsyth in Administrative Law 9th edition at page number 621states

as follows: itA distinction which needs to be clarified is that between public duties enforceable by Mandamus which are usually statutory and duties arising merely from contract. Contractual duties are enforceoble as matters if private law by the ordinary contractual remedies such as damages, injunction, specific performance and declaration, they are not enforceable by Mandamus which in the first place is confined to public duties and secondly is not granted where there are other adequate remedies. "

In K.S de Silva V National Water Supply and Drainage Board and another (1989) 2

SLR 1, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board called for applications from its

employees for the post of Accountant grade iv. The Petitioner applied for the post,

was called for an interview and the board approved his appointment to the post of

grade iv Accountant. The 2nd Respondent, the general manager has failed to carry out

the directions of the board and as failed to issue to the Petitioner the letter of

appointment. The Petitioner accordingly prayed for a Writ of Mandamus directing the

2nd Respondent to issue the letter of appointment.

The Supreme Court held that "in my opinion the office to which the Petitioner is seeking admission is not a "public office" of the kind which attrocts the remedy by way of Mandamus. It is an office essentially of a contractual or private character. Accordingly, as a matter of law, the Writ of mandamus does not lie and the application must fail. "

In Jayawardena V Peioples Bank 2002 3SLR 17 the court held that "courts will be ready and willing to apply the constitutionaf. remedy of Mandamus in the appropriate case. The appropriate case must be necessarily be a situation where there is a public duty. In the absence of a public duty an intrusion by this court by way of mandamus into an area where Remedial measures are available in private law would be to redefine the availability of a prerogative writ."

In Wickramasinghe V Ceylon Electricity Board and another 1997 2 SLR 377 court held

as follows. "the Petitioner has failed to satisfy this court that he has a statutory right to an extension of services under the 1st Respondent for a further period from 10.10.96. By P2 the Petitioner has entered into a private contract to serve as an engineering Assistant according to the terms and conditions in the letter of appointment. It is not and office created by statute with attendant legal rights to an extension of service till he reaches the age of sixty. He has no legal right to insist on the 1st Respondent extending his services on the basis of a right conferred by any statutory provision. Nor is the 1st Respondent under a statutory duty to extend the Petitioner's services. Thus, his applicotion for relief by way of certiorari and mandamus must faiL"

(P1S &RS). Perusing the said letter, it is revealed that the Manager, Human Resources of

Ceylon Petroleum Corporation had promoted the Petitioner to A6 from A7 according to the Respondents the Petitioner was the only candidate who came for interviews and the panel

of interviewers thought it fit to promote her to A6 instead of AS. Further the same was

placed before the Board of Directors of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and decided to

promote her to A6. It is submitted that the Petitioner had not accepted the promotion given to her to date. Further she had informed the management by letter dated 10/07/2013 that

she cannot accept the promotion.

Considering the facts before the court I am of the view that the advertisement clearly says

that the promotion is from A7 to AS. According to the notes of the interview panel which is

attached to RS reveals that the Petitioner is fit to promote to A6 and recommendation reads

as follows: lithe interview panel recommends to promote Mrs. A.CD. Silva (9284) to the

post of Assistant Operational Manager grade A6 w.e.f. 27/03/2013 and after completion of

one year at grade A6 with the recommendation of HOF to promote to the grade AS" (sic)

Considering the materials before us, I find the decision and the recommendation appears to

be reasonable and humane, the interview panel could have refused the promotion but it

was not so. Further the promotion to A6 is time lined and promotion to AS was clearly

recommended and informed to the Petitioner.

The promotion was given on the 2ih March 2013, the Petitioner came before the court was

on the 19th December 2014. It is more than 1 }'2 years. She had not purged her default or

explained the circumstances for her laches. Further the Petitioner had not properly

prosecuted her petition before the court. I find the Petitioner guilty of laches.

Considering all material facts before the court, I find that the relationship between the

Petitioner and the Respondent is of the nature of Employer -Employee contractual

relationship. Further the Respondent was not performing a public duty at this given

circumstances. I also find that the undue delay of the Petitioner to come before this court is not explained appropriately; hence the Petitioner is guilty of laches. After considering all

circumstances, I find that the Petitioner is not entitled for any relief by way of a Writ. Court

refuses to grant any relief.

Application dismissed without cost.
