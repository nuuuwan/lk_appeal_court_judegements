Judgment s. Thurairaja PC, J

The Accused appellant was found guilty for possessing 36.15 grams of Heroin, punishable under Section 54(A) (d) of the Poison Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Being aggrieved with the said

conviction and sentence the accused appellant had preferred an appeal to this court.

Both counsel for the Accused appellant and the Respondent made oral and written

submissions.

The accused appellant had raised the following grounds of appeal;

I. Contradiction per-se and inter-se were not considered by the trial

Judge. ii. The chain of evidence regarding the production was not properly

established.

III. Dock statement of the accused was not accepted or rejected by the

trial judge.

As per the available materials before the court, it appears that Inspector of Police (IP)

Liyanage who was attached to the Police Narcotics Bureau (PNB) received an

information on the 13th December 2002. He formed a 10-member team from the officers who were attached to the PNB, after fulfilling the formalities, proceeded for

this operation. It was at Ingurukade junction at Grandpas, Colombo 14 area. They

went to that place and laid ambush for the accused to come there. The informant

was also with the IP, he pointed at a three-wheeler and told them that is the vehicle

on which the accused is travelling. The officers stopped the three-wheeler and

searched the vehicle and the accused, there they found the accused was hiding a

parcel under his underwear. On their preliminary investigation it was suspected of Heroin and was taken into custody. The team continued with the investigation and

proceeded to his and his Brother in Law's house. They didn't find anything illegal

there and they returned to the bureau. IP Liya:1age had the custody of the accused

and the production at all times until he returned to the PNB and commenced the formalities. Initially he had done the field test and confirmed the substance to be of heroin. When it was weighed it was 144.6 grams. This was properly sealed with the Investigating Officers personal seal and the Thumb impression of the accused. This production was sent to the Government Analyst and it was found that it contained 36.15 grams of Diacetyl Morphine (Heroin).

At the trial before the High Court of Colombo, the prosecution led the evidence of 3 Police officers who were involved in the investigations and the Government Analyst

also marked P1 to P19. When the defence was called the accused opted to make a

Dock Statement and called two witnesses including his wife. Both Counsels for the

accused and the State made submissions. After giving reasons, the learned trial judge

found the accused guilty and imposed the minimum mandatory sentence of Life Imprisonment.

Keeping in mind the grounds of appeal put forward by the Counsel for the appellant, it warrants us to consider all evidence submitted at the trial court.

This was a raid conducted by IP Liyanage of the Police Narcotics Bureau, who had

received information with which he had commenced the investigation. Counsel for the accused appellant brings to the notice of the court that this witness originally

said that the information is about this accused and subsequently the book entry

showed the information was about the brother in law of the accused.

Further some issues were raised about the three-wheeler.

According to the prosecution witness, it was revealed that the informant was with

them and he showed the accused and the three-wheeler. PNB team arrested the accused and the drugs were found in the under pants of the accused. Given this

circumstance, the difference the counsel claims cannot be considered to affect the

findings of the learned trial judge.

Considering the evidence of the prosecution witnesses I do not thing that the trial judge had any materials against the prosecution to entertain a reasonable doubt.

The counsel for the accused appellant submits that the chain of production was not

established; hence the conviction cannot be sustained and the accused is entitled to

be released is the next ground of appeal.

The production was recovered by IP Liyanage, from the time of recovery until it was

sealed he categorically says that this production and the accused were in his custody.

They have gone in search of the accused's cousin; even at that time both were under

his custody. The production and the accused were brought to the Bureau where the

production was properly weighed and sealed. The accused was formally taken into

custody. The productions were properly inventoried and handed over to the reserve

from there it had reached the Government Analyst who confirmed that the

productions were with proper seal and unbroken at the time they received.

Considering the line of questioning and suggestion there is no reason for the trial

judge to suspect a break in the chain of production.

The accused appellant raises the last ground of appeal that the trial judge had not

considered the dock statement. Perusing all the evidence before the High Court and the spelled-out reasons by the trial judge, we find that the learned trial judge had considered the defence substantially before he came to a conclusion. We should be

mindful when a judge who has a trained judicial mind and experience cannot give all

the details he had considered to come to his conclusion. If we expect reasoning for

every issue in a case however trivial it maybe then it will be practically impossible for

the judges to write such a lengthy judgment with such work load in our courts. This

does not mean that the judge can give just one-word judgements to the issue at hand. It is in the nature of justice for a person (appellant) to reasonably expect reasoning for a judge's conclusion to a particular issue.

Carefully considering the arguments presented by both counsels I find that there is no material contradiction and break of chain of production to vitiate the conviction. Further the learned trial judge had substantially considered the evidence for the defence including the dock statement. Therefore, this court finds that there is no

merit on the grounds of appeal of the accused appellant. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed and the conviction and sentence is affirmed.

Appeal Dismissed.
