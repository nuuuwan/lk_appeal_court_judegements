P.R. Walgama, J

In this appeal the Accused - Appellant has called in

question the acceptability of the judgment passed by

the Learned High Court judge dated 09.11.2015, by

the Provincial High Court holden at Kurunegala. In

effect as per judgment the said High Court passed

death sentence on the Accused - Appellant.

The Accused - Appellant was tried on an indictment

charging him with having committed murder by

causing death of one Rajapaksa Durayalage Bandu an

offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal

Code.

The trial Court on a scrutiny of evidence adduced,

held the appellant herein, to be guilty of the charge

levelled against him and awarded him the sentence

as hereto before mentioned.

The background facts to this appeal can be

summarised as follows;

It is salient to note before the commencement of the

trial the counsel for the Accused - Appellant indicated

to court that the matter could be resolved by the

accused pleading for a lesser culpability.

As per testimony of the witness Nirmala Rajapaksa the

deceased was her mother-in-law. According to her

there had been a rivalry between these two families

and on this fateful day the deceased had gone to

the house of the accused to find out as to why he

has put some glass particles to the paddy field.

There the scuffle has ensued and the accused had

assaulted the deceased with the blunt side of the

mammoty as he was provoked by the deceased.

In the above setting it is urged by the counsel for

the Accused - Appellant that the Learned Trial Judge

should have imposed a sentence for culpable homicide

not amounting murder on the basis of

sudden provocation.

grave and

The Accused - Appellant In his dock statement had

stated that the deceased came to his house and

abused him for having put the glass particles to the

deceased's paddy field. It was his position that In

order to chase the deceased from his compound that

he had brandished the axe which struck on the

deceased.

It IS contended by the counsel for the Accused-

Appellant that the Learned High Court Judge had

failed to consider the said extenuating circumstances

viz a viz a sudden provocation caused by the deceased.

To buttress the above position the Learned Counsel

for the Accused - Appellant has adverted this court to

the case of PUNCHI BANDA .VS. QUEEN- 74 NLR-494-

which was held thus;

"our courts have repeatedly held that mere abuse

unaccompanied by any physical act may be sufficient

provocation to reduce the offence of murder to culpable

homicide not amounting to murder."

The provocative incident deducible from the narration

above it abundantly clear that it was the deceased

who went to the house of the Accused - Appellant

and abused him and provoked him.

The above proposition was also recognised In the

case of MALIMAGE SARATH GNASIRI PERERA .VS.

REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA. Decided on 28.09.98. and

was of the VIew that the attended circumstances

transpired thereto has established a sudden

provocation by the deceased and Their Lordships

were of the VIew that the sentence imposed on the

Accused - Appellant was grossly excessive and the

sentence for murder was set aside and convicted for

culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

In the instant appeal the counsel for the Respondent

urges In confutation that the attended circumstances

viz a viz do not merit the Accused - Appellant to get

shelter under 293 of the Penal Code on the ground

that the Accused - Appellant had only knowledge, but

4

i I,

iIf

has contended that accused could be convicted and

sentenced to culpable homicide not amounting to

murder on the basis of sudden provocation

punishable under Section 297 of the Penal Code.

For convenIence and brevity the above section IS

mentioned here under;

Section 297

"Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to

murder shall be punished with imprisonment of either

description for a term which may extend to twenty

years, and shall also be to fine if the by which

the death IS caused IS done with the intention of

causIng death, or to cause such bodily Injury as IS

likely to cause death."

OR

"With imprisonment of either description for a term

which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with

both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it

IS likely to cause death, or to cause such bodily

Injury as IS likely to cause death."

Therefore it is contended by the Learned Counsel for

the State that the Accused - Appellant had intended to

cause the death or of causing such bodily Injury as

IS likely to cause death of the deceased.

In the said back drop this court IS inclined to hold

that the sentence IS grossly exceSSIve. In the above

5

setting we affirm the finding and conviction In

respect of the offence of culpable homicide not

amounting to murder and set aside the conviction for

murder. Further the Accused - Appellant IS sentenced

for 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment, and the said jail

term will be operative and take effect from the date

of conviction viz. 04.11.2015. Subject to this variation

In sentence the appeal is dismissed.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed.
