L.T.B. Dehideniya J. (PIC. A.)

The Petitioner sought for a mandate in the nature of certiorari and

mandamus against the Respondent Bank challenging their Board

resolution where the Bank has decided to sell the land mortgaged to it by

the Petitioner by way of parate execution. The Petitioner states that he

mortgaged the land in question to the Respondent Bank and a part of the

money due has been paid. There is a dispute arose between them in

relation to the balance amount due. The Petitioner instituted action in the

High Court exercising civil jurisdiction (Commercial High Court) under

the Mortgage Act to get the Mortgage Bond cancelled by Court on

payment of balance amount due. The Petitioner states that while that case

is pending, the Board of Directors have resolved to sell the land. The

Petitioner is seeking to quash the said resolution.

The Petitioner supported for an interim relief but in the petition he has not

prayed for any interim relief. This Court cannot grant a relief which is not

prayed for in the petition.

The Petitioner has invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court under the

Mortgage Act and sought permission of Court to pay the balance and

cancel the Bond. When there is alternative remedy available, the

extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court cannot be exercised.

I refuse notice.
