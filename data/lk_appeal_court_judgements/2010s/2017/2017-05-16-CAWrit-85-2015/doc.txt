The petitioner above named submitted this petition to quash a

determination bearing No. 3/4/ 1 /(Jjfi) / 605 /~rliJl @@)tJ) 731 dated

01.09.2015 made by the 1 st Respondent Land Commissioner General

which is marked as P7 and attached to the petition.

The P7 above mentioned was issued by the 15t Respondent on the

01.09.2014 regarding a State land situated at Walagoda village, Embilipitiya

district. According to the said P7 the 1 st Respondent decided that the

relevant file had been lost and unable to identify the real person who

is entitle for the permit. But the investigation conducted on the 13th

January 2014 is relevant, both parties named M.T.N. Priyadharshana,

and G.D. Chandralatha were In occupation in the land in dispute then

the land is divided in equal half share i.e. half an acre to be given to

each party.

The Petitioner submits that this land was originally gIven to one

Menika (who was an unmarried male). The petitioner's father Weeratunga

Arachchige Karunaratne claims to be a close relative of Menika was

given the permit of the said land after the demise of Menika. The

permit No. 114/955 dated 21.02.2002, it is claimed by the petitioner

that his father was occupying the entire land and recently the 4th and

5th Respondents encroached 15 perches of the said land. when the

dispute arose the Commissioner General of land had given 15 perches

to the 41h and Slh Respondents and balance to the father of the

petitioner.

The Petitioner submits his father W.A. Karunaratne died in 2009. The

death certificate is marked as PI O. It is further submitted that the 41h

and Slh Respondents had encroached the land after the death of W.A.

Karunaratne. The 41h and Slh Respondents filed objections took up

preliminary objection to the effect that the petitioner has no locus

standi and the petitioner is guilty of laches.

According to the Petitioner the permit was given to Weeratunga Arachchige

Karunaratne, his mother and 3 children (including the Petitioner) were

the legal heirs. There IS no nomination or issuance of new permit is

before the Court. The 41h and Slh Respondents raises objection that the

petitioner is not legally permitted to hold the permit, the only material

before the Court is the affidavit, affirmed by G.D. Chandralatha Perera,

Weeratung Arachchige Duminda Prabha Karunaratne, Weeratunga

Arachchige Karunaratne Nimansala Prabani Karunaratne had stated that

they give consent of their Rights of the Property to the Petitioner.

The objection taken by the Respondent appears to be noteworthy and

the Court takes serious note of the said objection. Anyhow for the

purpose of completeness the Court proceeds further to consider all

material before taking final decision.

The Petitioner seek to quash P7 dated 01.09.2014 and the petition of

the petitioner was filed on the 151h of May 2015. There is delay more

C.A.Writ 85/2015 Order Page 417

5

than 8 months, this Court take serious note of the delay. The

petitioner has not explained the delay in the petition. Therefore I find

that the petitioner is liable and guilty of laches.

Anyhow, I wish to consider all materials before I conclude this matter

finally. It is submitted to the Court that the mother of the Petitioner

and wife of the original permit holder, G.D. Chandralatha was

employed at the Divisional Secretariat of Embilipitiya. The 1 st Respondent

had concluded that the relevant file is presently missing. I do not

hold anyone responsible because there is no material how the file

went missing.

The petitioner submits that the 4th and 5th Respondents encroached of

the said land after the death of his father's i.e. after 2009.

4 th and 5th Respondents submits that they were in occupation SInce

1976 and they were cultivating crops such as pepper and coconut and

claims that they were occupying the entire land. The 5th Respondent

submits that he had constructed a house in 2001, well before 2009.

They have submitted documents to support their claim, including a

letter from Death Welfare Society (6~)fJ)6 t:)B)",) where there are

more than 40 members signed.

The Court is of the view there are substantial material to suggest that

the 4th and 5th Respondents were living or occupying the said land or

part of the land much before 2009.

I peruse the determination made by the 1st ' Respondent dated

01.09.2014 which is marked P7. The land is clearly identified and

there is no doubt in the identification of the land. The second

paragraph of the letter reveals that there is dispute between W.

Karunawathie and G.D. Chandralatha and held an investigation on the

13.01.2014 and decided to act in the following manner.

The file relating to the said land had been misplaced therefore he is

unable to identify the correct owner. Anyhow it is proved that both

parties had possessed the land, therefore 0.0419 hectares to be divided

into two and given as follows. First lot to be given to T.C. Priyadahrshanie

half and acre and the second lot to be given to G.D. Chandralatha

(each wi II get Y:z acre).

Considering the objection taken by the 4th and 5th Respondents

regarding the locus standi, the Court holds in favour of the Respondent.

The petitioner had not explained the delay In filing this application,

therefore he is guilty of laches.

Considering all available material, this Court is not satisfied with the

submission of the petitioner to issue a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

said P7.

Anyhow considering the entire material before this Court, this Court is

of the view that this is not a fit and proper case for the Court to issue

a Writ against the I st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents to quashing the P7.

Hence the Court refuse to grant any relief prayed by the petitioner.
