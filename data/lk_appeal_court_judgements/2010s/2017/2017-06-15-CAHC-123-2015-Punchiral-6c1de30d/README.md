COMPLAINANT - RESPONDENT

Before : P.R. Walgama, J

: K.K. Wickremasinghe, J

Counsel : Neranjan Jayasinghe for the Accused - Appellant.

: Lakmali Karunanayake SSC, for AG.

Argued on : 22.03.2017

Decided on : 14.06.2017

P.R. Walgama, J

The Accused - Appellant fell to be sentenced by the by

the Learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura, for the

offence of serious violence, of committing the murder of

one Pushpa Kumara Premaratne which is punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code.

At the conclusion of the trial the Learned High Court

Judge handed down a conviction for murder and

sentenced the Accused - Appellant to death. It is against

the said conviction and sentence the Accused - Appellant

lodged the instant appeal to have the said conviction set

aside and glVe effect to an acquittal from the charge

stated above.

When this matter was taken up for argument counsel

for both parties, pursuant to their submissions, the counsel

for the Accused - Appellant submitted to court that he

will not challenge the conviction but urged to have the

sentence reduced from murder to culpable homicide not

amounting to murder on the facts stated here under.

It is pertinent to rnention that the Counsel appearIng

for the AG conceded to the above as the facts stems

from this case warrants such reduction of the sentence

of murder to culpable homicide not amounting murder.

Admittedly the Accused - Appellant and another two, who

were Grama Arakshaka were drunk that fateful night, as

it was their pay day. The deceased who was a higher

officer having seen the condition of the Accused - Appellant

who was sleeping outside the guard room has

reprimanded the Accused - Appellant for being drunk while

on duty.

Being agitated of the said warnIng by the deceased, the

Accused - Appellant has shot the deceased, behind the

guard room.

It is contended by the counsel for the Accused - Appellant

that there was no previous enmity between the Accused

- Appellant and the deceased. Hence it IS established

that the homicidal death was caused or occurred due

to a sudden fight, and without premeditation.

It IS also salient to note that the Judicial Medical

officer has expressed his opinion as to the possibility of

the death of the deceased due to the injuries sustained

as a result of the gun shot received. In that it was

opined that the injuries received by the deceased was

not necessary fatal and could be categorised as that one

was fatal in the ordinary course of nature. There fore it

is apparent had the deceased was given medical attention

his life would have been saved.

Therefore in the above setting this court is of the VIew

that it merits a variation of the sentence imposed) by

commuting the sentence to culpable homicide not

amoun ting to murder.

Accordingly the appeal IS allowed in part in VIew of the

above, and Impose a jail term of 10 years of Rigorous

Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10,000/ with a default

of 6 months Simple Imprisonment.

Subject to the above variation appeal IS dismissed

accordingly.

K.K.Wickremasinghe, J

I agree.
