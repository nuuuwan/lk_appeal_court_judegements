For the Accused - Appellant

Shanaka Wijesinghe D.S.G. for the

Attorney General

: 07th December, 2017

: 14th December, 2017

The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Polonnaruwa under

Section 364 (2) (e) of the Penal Code (as amended) for committing rape

on a fifteen years old girl. After trial he was convicted on the second

charge and sentenced to 10 years RI and a fine of Rs. 5,0001= was

imposed and he was ordered to pay Rs. 50,0001= as compensation to the

victim.

The story of the prosecution is that the victim after the demise of

her father was sent to a Children's Home at Koslanda. Sometime later

during the December school vacation her mother had brought her to the

house where she was living with the appellant. The prosecutrix has

testified that the accused appellant had sexual intercourse with her on

2

two occasions, once at home and on the second time in a teak forest.

She has not told the mother about this incident immediately but two or

three days later she has told the mother. She has been fifteen years of

age at this time. Therefore the question of consent does not arise. The

evidence reveals that the first complaint was made about 1 % months

after the incident and the victim has explained the delay that she did not

tell anyone out of fear.

In Sumanasena vs AG, 1999 3 SLR 137 it was held that, ''Just

because a witness is a belated witness, the court ought not to reject his

testimony on that score alone and that the delay should looked into". We

find that the delay has been adequately explained by the victim.

The medical evidence shows that there was an old healed tear, in

the hymen. Therefore the medical evidence corroborates the

prosecutrix's evidence.

The appellant making a dock statement had denied the incident.

Although there is no burden on the part of the accused appellant to prove

his innocence still he has not stated as to why he was wrongly implicated.

3

He has merely denied the whole incident. The learned High Court Judge

has properly analysed his dock statement and has rejected his evidence.

On perusal of the prosecutrix's evidence we find that not a single

contradiction or omission have been marked. We find that her evidence

passes the tests of probability and consistency.

For the afore stated reasons we decide to affirm the conviction and

the judgment dated 24/03/2016. The appeal is dismissed.
