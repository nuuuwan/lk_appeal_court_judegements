The Accused Appellants were indicted before the High Court of

Monaragala on a charge of robbery of the relics from a temple,

punishable under section 380 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

After trial all the accused Appellant were convicted and sentenced for 7

years RI. Being aggrieved by the judgment, all the accused appealed

against the conviction and the sentence. At the argument stage, the

Accused Appellants did not contest the conviction and limited the appeal

to the sentence.

The learned Counsels for the Appellants submitted the mitigatory factors

and moved that the sentence be reduced and make an order to give effect

to the sentence to be operative from the date of sentence in view of the

fact that the Appellants were incarcerated since then. The learned DSG

submitted the facts of the case for the Court to decide.

Several persons, covering their faces, have come to the temple in the

night and robed some relics from there threatening the head priest and the

two others who were at the temple at that time. The police detected the

Appellants soon after the incident, with the relics, in the middle of the

night, at a bus stop. The identification of the Appellants by the head priest

of the temple is unsatisfactory because he has admitted that the

Appellants were in the police station and he identified them there before

the identification parade. The learned High Court Judge was satisfied

with the circumstantial evidence that the Appellants were detected soon

after the incident with the relics and held that the charge was proved

beyond reasonable doubt. The Accused Appellants are not contesting the

conviction.

All three Accused Appellants were young persons at the time of

committing the offence. They were married persons with small children.

3

With the incarceration of the Accused Appellants, their children are

suffering.

The Accused Appellants were denied bail pending appeal and they are

incarcerated from the date of conviction, which is from 04.12.2014.

We consider all these mitigatory factors. We set aside the order of the

learned High Court Judge sentencing the Appellants for seven years and

we order all the Accused Appellants to be sentenced for six (6) years

Rigorous Imprisonment. We further order that the term of imprisonment

shall be operative from the date of conviction.

The fine and the default term ordered by the learned High Court Judge

are unchanged.

Judge of the Court of Appeal
