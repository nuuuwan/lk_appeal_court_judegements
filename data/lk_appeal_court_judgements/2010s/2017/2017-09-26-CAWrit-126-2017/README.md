We have heard the Learned Counsel for the Petitioner in support of this

application as well as the Learned State Counsel for the 1 st and 2nd Respondents.

The learned State Counsel has submitted the following preliminary objections to

the maintainability of this petition.

a) The Petitioner has no locus standi to have and maintain this action.

b) The powers taken over by the 1 sl Respondent Urban Development

Authority are powers that were delegated to the Kaduwela Municipal

Council by a planning circular by the 1 sl Respondent Authority and

therefore does not invoke Judicial review.

The learned State Counsel contends that the decision of the Board of Directors of

the Urban Development Authority dated 61h December 2016, bearing reference No.

2

2112016 and the order of the 3rd Respondent marked P 13, which is sought to be

quashed by the exercise of the prerogative remedies, is not a order given to the

Petitioner.

The letter dated 23 rd January 20 l3 bearing No. DDG/P/O 1111 is directed to the

Commissioner of the Kaduwela Municipal Council. By the said letter, the

Commissioner of the Kaduwela Municipal Council has been informed of the

decision of the Board of Directors of the Urban Development Authority to retake

some of the powers which had been delegated by a planning circular of the Urban

Development Authority dated 1

5l march 1985.

By letter marked P 13 the said order has been sent to the Commissioner of the

Kaduwela Municipal Council and not to the Petitioner. Therefore the learned State

Counsel argues that the Petitioner as described in paragraph 3 of the Petition

cannot seek relief from this Court in respect to a legal wrong or injury caused to

the Kaduwela Municipal Council.

By letter dated 23/0112017 marked P 13 the 1 sl Respondent Authority has taken

over the powers that were delegated to the Kaduwela Municipal council by

planning circular dated 1 sl March 1985. The powers which were originally vested

with the 1 st Respondent Authority were delegated to the said Municipal Council by

the direction dated 23/01 /2017. By the said direction in P 13, the powers delegated

by the Respondent Authority has been retaken. We find that the retaking of powers

3

which were previously delegated by the said Authority to the Kaduwela Municipal

Council does not contemplate an excess or abuse of power by the said authority.

In the circumstances, we also find that the Petitioner does not possess a valid

grievance or a sufficient interest to make this application.

Accordingly the application for notice is refused and the petition is dismissed

without costs.

I agree.
