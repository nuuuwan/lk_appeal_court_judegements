The accused appellant was indicted for soliciting a gratification of

Rs. 5,000/= from one Wilson the complainant on or about 12/01/2005

under sec. 19 (c) of the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption

Act. After trial the appellant was convicted for the said charge and

sentenced to two years RI and a fine of Rs. 5,000/= was imposed carrying

a default term of 12 months.

On the day in question the appellant had visited the complainant's

land accompanied by another senior officer namely D.B.S. Weesinghe to

ascertain the extent of land he was alleged to have been unlawfully

occupying. The land which was situated in a hilly terrain was inspected by

the appellant since the senior officer could not climb the hill. The appellant

after having inspected the boundaries accompanied by the complainant

had reported to the senior officer that the complainant was illegally

occupying one acre of land. Thereafter the senior officer and the appellant

had got the complaint to sign a letter. The appellant had asked the

complainant to come to his house the next day with his wife to discuss the

matter. At the said discussion which was held at the appellant's house the

following day, it was alleged that the appellant solicited Rs. 5,000/= to be

given to two senior officers. The complainant had gone to the Passara

Police and made a complaint and the Officer In Charge had asked him to

2

bring currency notes to the value of Rs. 5,000/=. These notes have been

initialled by the OIC. But the complainant and the OIC failed to carry out

the raid as planned by the OIC. Thereafter on the advice of the OIC after

about three weeks from the said date the complainant had made a

complaint to the Wild life Authority which was referred to the Bribery

Commission.

I find that the Officer In Charge without referring to the office of the

Bribery Commission has tried to conduct a raid having initialled the

currency notes given by the complainant which is not the legal procedure.

When there is an institution especially established to apprehend offenders

of this nature the OIC has assumed the duties which is out of his official

duties. Further the defacing of currency notes too is an offence under the

provisions of the Monetary Law.

Section 58 of the Monetary Law no 58 of 1949 (as amended)

states thus;

(a) cuts, per/orates, or in any other way whatsoever

mutilates any currency note,

(b)prints, stamps, or draws anything upon any currency

note, or affixes any seal or stamp to or upon any currency

note, or

3

(c) attaches or affixes to or upon any currency note anything

in the nature or form an advertisement.

The complainant's story that the appellant asked him to come to his

house with his wife is questionable. Will a person who solicits a bribe invite

a witness to be present at the time of the solicitation?

The complainant, his wife and son who were main witness at the

High Court are parties with vested interest and the learned High Court

Judge has not scrutinised their evidence with great care.

The learned High Court Judge rejected the dock statement of the

appellant by mistakenly stating that the person arrested by the appellant is

the complaint but it is another Wilson and not the complainant. This is a

grave misdirection by the learned High Court Judge.

I find that it is unsafe to allow the conviction to stand as the

prosecution has not presented cogent evidence. The charge rests entirely

on the word of mouth of the complaint. On applying the test of probability

I'm unable to accept the evidence of the complainant and the OIC.

4

For the afore stated reasons I decide to set aside the conviction and

sentence dated 24/06/2009 by the High Court of Colombo. Accordingly I

allow the appeal.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

L.U. Jayasuriya J.

I agree.
