S. DEVIKA DE LIVERA TENNEKOON J.

The Accused Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) w'as

indicted in the High Court of Negambo for the offence of the murder of

Kalupahana Messthriyalage Dilantha Kalum Silva under Section 296 of the

Penal Code.

The Appellant pleaded not guilty to the said charge and the prosecution led the

evidence of Dhanapala Bandaralage Sujith Kumara (PWl), Thalammaharage

Suranga Fernando (PW3), IP Nandana Wijekumara Lawrence (PW4) and Dr.

D.LL. Rathnayake (PW5, JMO) and the evidence of the Court interpreter and

concluded the case for the prosecution.

In brief the case for the prosecution was that on the date of the incident the

Appellant and four others (Percy -PW2, Kikki, Shashi and Chooty) hired the

three-wheeler of PWI to paste posters in the area in support of a political

3

candidate. As they had run out of paste the 6 of them had stopped at Samudra

Hotel in Handala Junction to prepare paste. PWI had gone into the Samudra

Hotel to have dinner whilst the Appellant and others had consumed liquor

outside the said Hotel whilst the paste was prepared. PWI had heard commotion

from outside the Hotel and therefore had mn out to see what the 'noise was

about. PWI had then seen the Appellant with a knife and he had got startled and

decided to flee from the area. When he started his three-wheeler he states in

evidence that he saw the Appellant stabbing the deceased on the chest.

Thereafter, the Appellant and four others have forcibly got on to his three-

wheeler and directed PWI to drop them off at Elakanda.

After the conclusion of the prosecution's case the Appellant gave an unsworn

statement from the dock denying all allegations levelled against him and stated

that a person named Malaka who was never investigated by the police had

committed the crime and pleaded that he be acquitted.

After the conclusion of the case the learned High Court Judge found the

Appellant guilty of the offence of murder and sentenced him to death.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Appellant preferred the instant appeal

on the grounds inter alia that;

a) PWl is not a credible witness as he is an interested witness who was keen

on his own freedom and whose statement is belated,

b) The identification of the Appellant made by PW3 is not credible since it

was a dock identification

c) The learned High Court Judge has failed to correctly evaluate the burden

of proof

4

At the outset it is prudent to note that the conviction of the Appellant is mainly

based on the testimony of PWI and a dock identification of the Appellant by

PW3. PWI as mentioned above was the three wheel driver who was hired to

paste posters as mentioned above. It is clear that it was PWI whQ was first

arrested in connection to the murder of the deceased on or about 26.09.2000.

As contended by the learned Counsel for the Appellant PWI who was initially

the main suspect in the Magistrate Court who was in remand custody for over

one year was immediately enlarged on bail after he made a statement implying

the Appellant in the murder of the deceased. PWI has stated in evidence that he

was not granted bail as the others were not arrested and it was only after a high

ranking official of the Prisons Department advised him he decided to make a

statement to the learned Magistrate. The learned Counsel for the Appellant

contends that it is unsafe to act on the evidence of PWI as his statement was

made nearly 10 months after the incident and that he is not an independent

witness and further that he was an interested witness since PWI was in remand

custody in connection to the death of the deceased.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General states in rebuttal that although PWI has

not given a clear reason as to why he did not immediately report the accused to

the Police, as stated in evidence, PWI feared his own safety and in view of this

the learned High Court Judge has directed the OIC of the Wattala Police to

provide him with security after he gave evidence. The learned DSG further

submits that PWI had decided to give a statement to the learned Magistrate

since he was distressed as he had to languish in remand while the real offender

was living freely outside.

In the case of Dhannasiri vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 2012 (1) SLR 268

Tilakawardane, J held inter alia;

"Two critical tests before considering belated evidence as reliable

" evidence are: firstly reasons for delay and secondly, whether those

reasons are justifiable."

In the same case in the Court of Appeal (2010 (2) SLR 241) Sisira de Abrew, J

held inter alia;

"Because the witness is a belated witness, Court ought not to reject his

testimony on that score alone. Court must inquire into the reason for the

delay and if the reason for the delay is plausible and justifiable the Court

could act on the evidence of the belated witness."

Further, in the case ofUdagam Vs. AG 2000 (2) SLR 103 relied by the learned

Counsel for the Appellant it was held that;

Evidence is infirm, unsafe and unreliable to act upon considering the

following;

(i) the belated statement made to the Police with delay not

explained with acceptable reasons.

Therefore, when considering the evidentiary value of the belated statement of

PWI made to the Magistrate ,what this Court must consider first are the reasons

for the delay and secondly whether the reasons are justifiable.

6

It is clear that the reason for PWI 's delay in implicating the Appellant was fear

for his own safety. However, this reason has not been elaborated on by the

prosecution. The fact that the learned High Court Judge has directed the Police

to provide police protection to PWl, in my view, serves no real purpose since

such protection was provided to the witness after his testimony. Any person

who sought to intimidate PWI may have done so before his testimony since

after PWI's statement to the Magistrate the nature of his evidence was clear.

No such intimidation and I or a threat of intimidation was placed on record by

the prosecution before the evidence of PWI was led and as such this Court is of

the view that the reasons given by PWI for the belated statement to the

Magistrate is not justifiable.

In the aforementioned case Dharmasiri vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka 2012 (1)

SLR 268 Tilakawardane, J further held that;

"when considering the belated evidence or a belated statement, one

cannot neglect the basis for such delay which transpired in the evidence. "

In the instant Appeal no such evidence has transpired for this Court to consider

and as such this Court finds that the evidence of PWI implicating the Appellant

is of low evidentiary value.

The second ground of Appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the Appellant is

that the identification of the Appellant made by PW3 is not credible since it was

an identification of the Appellant who was in the dock.

What transpired in the evidence of PW3, who was the brother-in-law of the

deceased and also the virtual complainant, was that he had seen the Appellant

I 1 ; ! I I I I I

I. I I i ! I I I I

7

and several others (4 - 5 persons) attacking the deceased. PW3 had witnessed a

fair skinned person wearing a blue shirt pulling a knife from the deceased who

threatened him with the knife stating that 'Y au will also be stabbed, take him

(the deceased) away.'

This Court notes as a senous lapse on the part of the prosecution that no

identification parade was conducted to identify beyond reasonable doubt that it

was the Appellant who was carrying the knife as aforementioned. The lapse is

further highlighted where PW3, as stated in evidence, had described two

persons to the police and as such a specific identification of the Appellant was

vital to establish that it was the Appellant who caused the death of the deceased.

It was further revealed that PW3 was intoxicated at the time of incident.

As submitted by both parties E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy in his work the Law of

Evidence, volume 1, has discussed the evidentiary value of a dock

identification. He states;

"The consensus of opinion in England is that dock identification of the

accused for the first time in Court is undesirable and usually unfair, and

that it should be avoided, if possible, but this does not mean that the

conviction would be set aside, the Courts discretion in the matter being

recognised in appropriate circumstances.'"

E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy further quotes the unreported case of Gunaratne

Banda Vs. The Republic S.c. 132 - 136176 - H.C. Kegalle 79175 -" S.C.M of 2nd

March 1978 in which case Wijesundara J held that, 'The other witnesses

identified the accused for the first time at the trial in the dock. Again it has been

repeatedly said even in the recent past by this Court, in more cases than one that

~ I I I

I I

I

this type of evidence is worthless and, if I may add, no useful purpose will be

served in leading such evidence' .

The learned Counsel for the Appellant submits the principles discussed in the

case ofR vs. Turnbull & others (1976) 3 All E. R. 549, Cr. Ap. Reports 132 in

which case it was held;

"Whenever the case of an accused person depend wholly or substantially

on the correctness of one or more identifications of the accused which the

defence alleges to be mistaken, the judge should warn the jury of the

special need for caution before convicting in reliance on the correctness

of the identification"

It was held in the case of Keerthi Bandara V. the Attorney General 2000 (2)

SLR 245 that "Turnbull Rules' apply, wherever the case against the accused

depends wholly or substantially on the correctness of one or more

identifications of the accused which the defence alleges to be mistaken".

As submitted by the learned Counsel for the Appellant in the case of LO.W.

Wasantha & three others Vs. the Attorney General (C.A. 179/2006) Ranjith

Silva J had held that;

"On the issue of identification evidence, the judge must give accurate

directions regarding the identification evidence and direct the jury that

they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused were

correctly identified and give the benefit of any doubt to the accused. If no

identification parade was held and the accused was a stranger, the judge

must caution the jury that the identification may become a mere dock

I I ! I i !

I

9

identification and must direct the jury that the omISSIon to hold an

identification parade may be an important omission for the purpose of

identification. "

In the instant case it seems that the learned High Court Judge has found the

Appellant guilty of the murder of the deceased mainly on the evidence of PWI

and PW3's dock identification and therefore this Court finds that this evidence

is not sufficient to establish the case for the prosecution beyond reasonable

doubt.

In relation to the third ground of Appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the

Appellant regarding the burden of proof it was held in the case of N andana

Vs. Attorney-General 2008 (1) SLR 5lby Sisira de Abrew J that;

"Imposing a burden on the accused to prove his innocence is totally

foreign to the accepted fundamental principles of our Criminal Law as to

the presumption of evidence.

"The mis-statements of law by the trial Judge would tantamount to a

denial of a fundamental right of any accused as enshrined in Art 13(5) of

the Constitution - a misdirection on the burden of proof is so fundamental

in a criminal trial that it cannot be condoned and could necessarily vitiate

the conviction."

Another serious lapse on the part of the prosecution is noted in the instant

Appeal that been, the absence of PW2's evidence. Upon a perusal of the Court

record it is clear that PW2 was periodically present in Court. PW2 one Peter

Kurerage Percy Cooray was one of the individuals who accompanied the

10

Appellant in PWI 's three-wheeler to paste posters. PW2 who was also arrested

in connection to the death of the deceased (as stated by PW 4) would have been

the best witness to corroborate the narration of the prosecution which led to the

death of the deceased. However, it is unfortunate that the prosecution for

whatever reason has failed to lead the evidence of PW2 who this Court finds to

be a material witness in this case.

The learned Trial Judge has also observed that the investigating officers have

conducted the investigation into the death of the deceased in a lackadaisical

manner. This further indicates that the weakness in the prosecution's case the

benefit of which must be for the Appellant.

Taking into consideration all these infirmities and the other matters referred to

above, we set aside the conviction and the sentence of death imposed on the

Accused-Appellant and acquit him. Accordingly the Appeal is allowed.
