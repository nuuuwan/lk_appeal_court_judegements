The accused respondent was charged under sec. 2 of the

Convention Against Torture and other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading

Treatment or Punishment Act no. 22 of 1994. After trial the accused was

acquitted and the aggrieved party has filed this appeal against the said

acquittal.

The accused has taken the suspect aggrieved party (hereinafter

referred to as petitioner) into custody for an allegation of theft on the

18/04/2002 this was not in dispute. The petitioner after being assaulted

has fallen unconscious inside the cell and was admitted to the Ragama

Hospital by the respondent. The petitioner stated that due to torture

inflicted on him he got a fit.

The Judicial Medical Officer giving evidence in the High Court has

stated that there were 10 life threatening injuries on the petitioner, as well

as wounds on the feet and soles of the feet which the petitioner's counsel

stated were not considered by the High Court Judge. The High Court

Judge has stated in (p.12) the judgment that there were no wounds on the

feet according to the medical evidence which amounts to a misdirection on

the part of the High Court Judge.

3

The petitioner's counsel argued that the learned High Court Judge's

analysis of the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer regarding the

injuries on the feet of the petitioner is erroneous. The High Court Judge

has stated (vide page 09 of the judgment) that the two persons who were

at the petitioner's house were not called as witness to corroborate the

petitioner's evidence. These two persons are not listed as witness in the

indictment. Therefore calling them as witness does not arise. This is a clear

misdirection and we find that the learned High Court Judge is not mindful

of the provisions of sec. 134 of the Evidence Ordinance.

134 provides this;

tlNo particular number of witnesses shall in any case be

required for the proof of any fact".

On perusal of the petitioner's evidence we find that he has identified

the person who assaulted him. The learned High Court Judge has failed

to see that the aggrieved party's evidence is enough to identify the person

who assaulted him. It was decided in AG vs Mohamed Saheeb Mohamed

Ismath CA no. 87197 and S.C. appea/154/10 AG vs Devandorage Nihal

that the evidence of a sole eye witness is enough to prove a charge against

an accused provided he has given cogent evidence.

4

It is a well known principle of law that reliance can be based on the

solitary statement of a witness if the court comes to the conclusion that the

said statement is the truth. And it was held in Raja vs State (1997) 2

Crimes 175 (Delhi).

tIthe courts are concerned with the merit of the statement of

a particular witness. They are not concerned with the

number of witnesses examined by the prosecution."

In state of Maharashtra vs Suresh Nivsutti Bhaunare (1997) 2

Crimes 257 (Born) it was held;

"The law of Evidence does not require any particular

number of witnesses to be examined in proof of a given

fact. However, faced with the testimony of a single

witness, the court may classify the oral testimony of a

single witness, the court may classify the oral testimony

into three categories, namely (i) wholly reliable, (ii) wholly

unreliable, and (iii) neither wholly reliable nor wholly

unreliable. In the first two categories there may be no

difficulty in accepting or discarding the testimony of the

single witness. The difficulty arises in the third category

of cases. The court as to be circumspect and has to look

for corroboration in material particulars by reliable

testimony, direct or circumstantial, before acting upon

testimony of a single witness. II

5

The learned High Court Judge has also failed to consider that the

injuries to the petitioner were caused while he was in police custody.

The learned President Counsel for the respondent argued that the

High Court Judge has considered as to whether the prosecution has

discharged the duty of proving the charge. We are not inclined to agree

with this argument on consideration of the judgment.

After considering the evidence placed before the High Court, the

judgment of the High Court and the submissions made, we decide to send

back this case for a retrial. The judgment dated 09/10/2008 is set aside

and the appeal is allowed. The learned High Court Judge is directed to

dispose this case expediously.

Registrar is directed to send back the case record to the High Court

of Negombo.

Appeal allowed.

I agree.
