JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for all the Parties, when this case came up on 2017-07-26

before us, agreed to have this case disposed, by way of written

submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral submissions.

They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment after

considering the written submissions they had already filled. Therefore, this

judgment would be based on the material that have been adduced by

parties in their pleadings and the contents of the.written submissions filed

by them.

The Applicant Competent Authority - Respondent - Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent) had issued a quit

notice on one R Arumugam from the premises in dispute in this case.

It appears that there had been a revision application in the Provincial High

Court holden in Nuwara Eliya against the said order of eviction made by

the learned Magistrate.

After the order of the Provincial High Court was received, the order of

eviction was executed by the Magistrate's Court.

Thereafter, the Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant R Arumugam

Ramanathan (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant), had

made an application to the Magistrate's Court seeking restoration of his

possession in the premises on the basis that the proceedings leading to his

eviction was not against him but only against R Arumugam who is his

father. Learned Magistrate by the order dated 2012-04-24, had refused the

said application.

5

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate, the

Appellant had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court

holden at Nuwara Eliya.

Although the petition of appeal does not state which order is specifically

challenged in this appeal, it appears that it is the above judgment that the

Appellant has canvassed in this appeal in this Court. It is to be note that

section 6 A of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act mandates the

Court to make all such orders as are necessary to ensure that such persons

are ejected from such land. As has been specified by section 5 (1) (b) the

term 'such persons' here connotes the person in possession and his

dependents if any.

Further, section 18 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act has

defined the word "dependent" as follows;

" ......... "dependent" , in relation to a person in possession or occupation of

state land, means any person who is dependent on the person in

possession or occupation, whether as spouse, child or otherwise, and

includes any other person who is permitted by the person in possession or

occupation to hold or occupy such land; ........ "

'I

6

It is common ground that the said ejectment has already been effected.

The Appellant has not set out any legal basis upon which he could claim a

restoration of possession of this land for himself.

In these circumstances, this Court is unable to see any merit in this appeal.

Hence, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with costs.
