The Plaintiff - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted action

in the District Court of Kuliyapitiya by Plaint dated 11.01.199 against the 1 st - 3 rd

Defendants for inter alia;

a) A declaration that the Plaintiff is the owner of the land described in the

Schedule to the Plaint,

b) For an order ejecting the 1 st and 2nd Defendants from the said premises.

The 1 st and 2nd Defendants above named filed answer dated 1993.05.11 praying for

inter alia a dismissal of the Plaint. They contented inter alia that the premises in

question is one that is envisaged under the provisions of the Rent Act No. 07 or

1972 and as such the Plaintiff was not entitled to proceed with the action. Further,

the 1 st and 2nd Defendants averred that they had possessed the premises under a

Tenancy and as such claimed Tenancy Rights and sought a dismissal of the Plaint.

Trial commenced on 16.06.1994 and the jurisdiction of Court and the Plaintiff's

title was recorded as admissions. Issue Nos. 1 - 4 were raised on behalf of the

Plaintiff, Issue Nos. 5- 13 were raised on behalf of the Appellants.

Under Section 150 of the Civil Procedure Code the Defendant commenced trial

and documents marked 2V 1 - 2V 14 were marked. The Plaintiff led evidence

thereafter marked documents PI - P3 and closed the case.

The learned District Judge delivered judgment dated 28.01.1999 in -favour of the

Plaintiff. Being aggrieved by the said judgment the 15t & 2nd Defendants preferred

the instant appeal.

The main issue to be determined by this Court is whether the 151 & 2nd Defendants

have established tenancy rights to the premises in suit.

The position of the 1 st & 2nd Defendants is that they came to possess the premises

in suit in 1979 under one R. A. Wijesinghe as a tenant paying Rs. 125/- a month.

Thereafter as the said R. A. Wijesinghe wanted a lump sum of two years rent

payment a lease agreement bearing No. 5676 dated 07.11.1982 marked as 2V2

was entered into with the 15t Defendant and the said R. A. Wijesinghe for a period

of two years for a sum ofRs. 3,000/-.

As correctly noted by the learned District Court Judge the matter in issue is

whether the tenant can occupy the premises in suit after the expiration of the lease

agreement marked 2V2.

The 1 st & 2nd Defendants argue that the premises in suit is one which falls under

the purview of the Rent Act. For this purpose it was necessary to establish that the

1 st & 2nd Defendants occupied the said premises as tenants. The 1 st & 2nd

Defendants contend that after the expiration of the lease agreement marked as 2V2

and after 1984, rent was paid to the 3 rd Defendant. After the 1 st & 2nd Defendants

became aware that the present owner was the Plaintiff they had attempted to pay

her rent but however, the Plaintiff had rejected same.

As duly noted by the learned District Court Judge the 1st & 2nd Defendants have

failed to produce any documentation to the effect that they have paid Tent to the 3rd

Defendant or any other person after the expiration of lease agreement bearing No.

5676 dated 07.11.1982 marked as 2V2. As such the 1st & 2nd Defendants have

failed to establish that they have continued to occupy the premises in suit as a

tenant. Therefore the provisions of the Rent Act do not apply to the instant case.

The 1 st & 2nd Defendant relies on the cases of Telenis Vs. Gunaratne 47 NLR 433

in which it was held that even after the expiration of a lease agreement a tenant can

occupy the premises as a tenant. However, the said case must be distinguished

from the instant application on the facts.

In the circumstances mentioned above I see no reason to disturb the findings of the

learned District Judge dated 28.01.1999. Therefore this Appeal is dismissed with

costs set at Rs. 10,0001-.

Appeal Dismissed.
