Further, an endorsement contained in the document marked and annexed with the petition as Pi0(J) refers to EPF payments made for \"CT&FC staff' (i.e. the staff of the Petitioner). The fact that EPF contributions had been made by the Petitioner for the entire duration of the 6th Respondent's employment mentioned in the 6th Respondent's complaint (from 1st January 2005 to 30th June 2010) is also confirmed by document marked R5 which comprises the EPF record maintained by the Central Bank in which the Petitioner is named the \"employer\" and the 6th Respondent the \"employee\". It is accordingly submitted that the mere issuance of cheques for EPF dues by the 5th Respondent without more, cannot by itself establish that the 5th Respondent is the \"employer\" of the 6th Respondent (as well or of all the4 other employees mentioned therein) for purposes of the Payment of Gratuity Act, particularly in view of the denial of employment by the 5th Respondent.",

This inference is supported by the endorsement in Pi O(J) referred to above. e) No documentary proof whatsoever was submitted to show that the 6th Respondent's salary was paid by the 5th Respondent from July 2010 onwards. f) The case cited by the Petitioner is a case where the court had to decide who the \"employer\" of the workmen concerned was. The Court considered matters such as payment of wages, supervision and control of work and whether the workmen constituted an integral part of the workforce. In the present case the Petitioner has not submitted any material by which these matters could be determined, in fact as mentioned above, no material has been submitted even in respect of the payment of wages. g) Finally, the position taken by the Petitioner in paragraph 20(a) of the petition is",
