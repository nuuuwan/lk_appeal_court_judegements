K. K. WICKRAMASINGHE, J.

The Accused Appellant (herein after referred to as t~~ Appellant) was indicted in the High Court

of Colombo on the following charges:-

(1) On or about 1st of February 1999 at lotus Road, Colombo, within the jurisdiction of this

court the accused cheated H. Kamitsuma, to issue a cheque of RS.12,960,026.50 which

amounts to an offence punishable under section 403 of the Penal Code.

(2) On or about 2ih May 1999 at the same place and during the course of the same

transaction, the accused tendered a forged document as genuine to Jayantha Sarath

Kumara of Sri lanka Telecom. Thereby he committed an offence punishable under

section 456 of the Penal Code read with section 459 of the Penal Code.

(3) On or between 1st February 1999 and 27th May 1999 within the course of the same

transaction and jurisdiction of this court, the accused committed an offence of

misappropriation of Rs. 6,437,888/= from Sri lanka Telecom, an offence punishable

under section 386 of the Penal Code.

When the indictment was read over to the Accused Appellant he pleaded 'not guilty' to the

charge and accordingly the trial was commenced before the Llearned High Court Judge.

After trial the learned High Court Judge of Colombo found the Accused Appellant guilty of all

three charges levelled against him. Accordingly he was convicted and sentenced as follows:-

On Charge 1- Sentenced to a term of 3 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10/000.00

with a default sentence of 6 months.

On Charge 2- Sentenced to a term of 3 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10/000.00

with a default sentence of 6 months.

On Charge 3- Sentenced to a term of 3 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 6A37/888

with a default sentence of 6 months.

The instant appeal is arising in pursuant to a conviction and the sentence imposed on the

Accused-Appellant.

During the course of the argument counsel for the accused appellant raised following grounds

of Appeal:-

(l)The prosecution has failed to call H.Kamitsuma as a witness/ the person described as being

deceived in the cheating charge. he was not only not called but not even listed as a witness in

the indictment.

(2)The prosecution has failed to prove the 2nd charge on the indictment beyond reasonable

doubt.

(3)The prosecution has failed to call a crucial witness in presenting their case. It was submitted

on behalf of the appellant that it was witness Atapattu (PW16) on the indictment) who was

instrumental in authorising the cheque issued to the Appellant.

(4) The learned High Court Judge has failed to analyse the defence evidence and has

misdirected himself on the burden of proof.

The trial has commenced by calling prosecution witness No.3 Jayantha Sarath Kumara

Jayasooriya/ the Accountain of Sri Lanka Telecom. Thereafter five other witnesses namely

Kusumawathi Hiyarapitiya- retired Finance Manager/ Internal Auditor Sri Lanka Telecom/

Manager People/s Bank/ former Manager Operations of Sri Lanka Logistics and Investigating

Officer were called to give evidence on behalf of the prosecution. After the proseuction case

the accused appellant has given evidence. Registrar of the District Court of Colombo has given

evidence as a defence witness.

The counsel for the accused appellant submitted that in order to prove charge No.1 the

prosecution has to prove that the said Mr. Kamitsuma was deceived by the appellant beyond

reasonable doubt. Therefore without his evidence, the prosecution was unable to prove charge

one beyond reasonable doubt.

He further submitted that the fact whether he was under .deception when the decision was

made is fact solely within his mind unless it is expressed in some document written by him. In

the case of ABEYWARDENE Vs MUTHUNAYAGAM 47 NLR 12, following the dictum of Rowlet J.

in the English case LIGHT (1913-191524 COX 718) decided lilt is quite clear that on a charge of obtaining goods or money by false pretences, no conviction is possible unless it is shown that the mind of the prosecutor was misled by the false pretence and that he was thereby induced to part with his money or goods"

Also submitted that neither Mr. Athapaththu nor Mr. D.W.R. Wijeweera was called as

witnesses. Version of the prosecution was that hand written note at the end of the document

P2 submitted that the said document had been forwarded to Mr. Kamitsuma (CEO of Sri Lanka

Telecom) by Mr. Athapaththu head of the division Procurement. He further submitted that P1

did not contain any reference of that to the CEO Mr. Kamitsuma though there was a reference

written by Mr. Athapaththu seeking approval from CEO in the Document P2 these documents

do not have any reference made by Mr. Kamitsuma to prove that the said documents had been

actually seen or perused by the CEO by the time he made the endorsement in P8.

Since Mr. Athapaththu was also not called as a witness for the prosecution; the learned counsel

is invited this court to draw an adverse inference in terms of illustration (f) of section 114 of the

Evidence Ordinance that Athapaththu's evidence would if produced, be unfavourable to the

prosecution. He further submitted that no evidence was placed by the prosecution to prove

that P1, P2 was sent to the CEO together with document P8. Therefore the prosecution has

failed to prove that the 1st ingredient of count No.1, that is the appellant had deceived

Kamitsuma. Further mentioned, that the mental element (mens rea) of the charge of cheating

was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.

It is pertinent to note that the document P1 -P8 is available in the file of record. When

perusing the same it is evident that the witness has received the approval of CEO and it

contains that the said. approval is already attached. The approval of Mr. Kamitsuma is endorsed

at document P8.Document marked P3(voucher) and P4(cheque) confirm that Rs. 12,960,026/50

was paid to the appellant's company as a result of this deception.

Definition of "proved" is stipulated in Section 3 of the evidence ordinance. It states that "A fact

is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it, the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists"

Section 59 of the Evidence ordinance states that all facts except the contents of documents

may be proved by oral evidence.

Section 61 states that contents of documents need to be proven by primary or secondary

evidence. Section 62 of the Evidence ordinance states that primary evidence is the document

itself presented to the court.

When considering the first count, the prosecution has established this count on the basis of

documents which were produced before court supported by oral evidence.

In this transaction the Appellant submitted to the Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) two documents

making out a monetary figure which was much more than due to him asking that a cheque be

issued to make Port Authority payments. This request is found in documents P1 and P2 signed

under the hand of the appellant. This is accepted by the appellant.

After submitting these documents by the appellant, the SLT authorities have obtained the

authority of the CEO bV way of minutes, to issue the relevant cheque to the appellant.

Therefore the person deceived H.Kamitsuma need not be called to give oral evidence, when the

fact that he was deceived was clearly reflected on the documents marked as "p1" and "p2" by

the prosecution.

The approval would not have been granted if not for the deception on the CEO by the Appellant

therefore the ingredients of the cheating charges are established.

Further documents marked as P3 (voucher) and P4 (cheque) confirm that Rs.12,960,026j50 was

paid out to the appellants company as a result of this deception.

Thus where the documents speak for themselves the oral evidence of the CEO Kamitsuma

would not be necessary to prove the ingredients of cheating. (Vide also document marked P8)

The learned trial Judge also has considered this position in his Judgement (vide pages 415 - last

5 lines from the bottom and top 7 lines) and held that the appellant's dishonest or fraudulent

representation deceived the CEO of Telecom to authorize this payment.

~. .,."

,

In PERERA Vs. ATTORNEY GENERAL 1985 2 SllR 156 it was held that,

lilt is the inducement and not the delivery that constitutes the gist of the crime. The words I

induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person in the penal section I are

wide enough to include not only property in the ownership or possession of the person so

induced but also any property under the control of the person so induced on whose

authorization the property shall be delivered."

Thus the submission of the learned precedence counsel has no merit in the light of the

evidence led in the trial.

(1) The learned President's counsels next submission was that the prosecution has failed to prove the second charge on the indictment beyond a reasonable doubt.

It was the contention of the learned president's counsel that the forged invoice tendered to the

accountant procurement at Sri Lanka Telecom (P5) was not identified clearly as the document

he tendered by Lalith Wijesekera (PW 13). By perusing proceedings very carefully, it is apparent

that this was because (at page 336 of the brief) the witness appears to be confused as to

whether he saw the forged receipt (pS) or the genuine receipt (p12).

PW 13 as the appell?nts operations manager at the time was used by the ar;cused-appellant to . ,. tender the forged receipt (P5) to the SLT to show that the appellants company has paid to the

Sri Lankan Ports Authority (SLPA) Rs. 11,884,562/-.

However the actual receipt which was issued for the payment really made by the appellants

company to the SLPA was only Rs. 5,446.674/-(vide P12)

Thus the Appellant had deceived the SL T's accountant (PW3) that Rs. 6,437.888/- more than

the amount was really paid to the SLPA. This had enabled the accused-appellant to reimburse

his port expenses from the SLT by deception and thereby make a wrongful gain.

PW 4 witness Kusumawathie Hiripitiya, who was the finance manager at the SLPA at the time

relevant to this incident has given clear evidence to say that receipt marked P5 in court was not

a Genuine receipt issued by the SLPA (vide pages 233-234 of the brief).She also has identified

the genuine receipt issued by the SLPA as P11 which related to a transaction unconnected to

this incident. She also has identified the genuine receipt as P12.

When the evidence of PW3 Jayantha Sarathkumara Jayasuriya of the SLT, evidence of PW 13

Lalith Wijesekera and evidence of PW4 of the SLPA are considered along with the documents

6

PS and P12 it is clear that the prosecution has proved the offence of dishonestly tendering a

false document beyond any reasonable doubt.

This evidence has been carefully considered and appreciated by the learned trial judge in his

Judgement (vide pages 416-417 of the brief). Therefore the Appellants second ground of appeal

ought to fail.

(2.) The next ground advanced on behalf of the appellant was that the prosecution has failed to

call a crucial witness in presenting their case. It was submitted on behalf of the Appellant that it

was Witness Atapattu (PW 16 on the indictment) who was instrumental in authorising the

cheque issued to the Appellant.

However one cannot say that he is an essential witness to the prosecution to prove the

necessary ingredients on the offences on the indictment. The prosecution will have to decide

on the witnesses. Therefore it is clear that the court cannot be called upon to come to the

presumption stated in section 114(f) of the Evidence ordinance.

In WAllMUNIGE JOHNN vs. THE STATE 76 NlR 488 @ 496 G.P.A. Silva SPJ( president) of the

court of criminal Appeal having considered the leading authorities on this point R vs. CHAlO

SINGHO 42 NlR 269 and K vs. SENEVIRATNE 38 NlR 221 (PRIVY COUNCil) held as follows:-

liThe question of 0 presumption orises only where 0 witness whose evidence is necessory to unfold the norrotive i.e withheld by the prosecution and the failure to cal' such witnesses constitutes a vital missing link in the prosecution case and where the reasonable inference to be drawn from the omission to call the witness is that he would, if called, not have supported the prosecution. But where one witnesses evidence is cumulative of the other and would be a mere repetition of the narrative A would be wrong to direct a jury that the failure to call such witness gives rise to the presumption under section 114(f) of the Evidence Ordinance. II

Thus it is abundantly clear that witness Atapattu's evidence would hav,e if led by the

prosecution would merely burden the court record by been a repetition of the narrative as

opposed to a missing link in the prosecution case. Therefore there was no necessity to lead this

witness without whose testimony the prosecution case was established.

(3.) The appellants counsel also submitted to court that the learned trial judge has failed to a~alyze the Defence evidence and has misdirected himself on the burden of proof.

The learned trial judge has considered the Defence position along with the analysis of the

prosecution evidence. (Vide pages 413,414,415,416 para1, 416 Para 4, 417)

7

The trial judge has also correctly considered the accused appellants admission under oath to

accepting the Cheque marked as P4 (vide pg 414 Para 2) and the fact that the cheque obtained

by cheating for an excessive amount than the appellant was entitled to be deposited in the

appellants account. This very clearly proves the dishonest misappropriation of approximately

6.4 million rupees with regard to the charge no 3 on the indictment.

In the light of the aforesaid reasons, the Prosecution has proved all 3 counts on the indictment

and not only the 3rd charge (as submitted on behalf of the appellant). Therefore this court is of

the view that the judgment and conviction of the learned High Court Judge is supported by oral

as well as documentary evidence which is un contradicted and un assailed.

The appellants counsel also urged this court to consider a lenient sentence for the appellant, if

not the appeal is allowed. The learned President's counsel argued that considerable time has

lapsed since the alleged incident (17 years since the date of offence in 1999), (14 years since

indictment in 2002 and 9 years since conviction in 2007), the age of the accused and the fact

that the Appellant had two children as grounds of mitigation. However these grounds cannot

be seriously considered as the appellant has been on post-conviction bail since 08.01.2008

despite the above custodial terms been imposed by the trial court.

The appellant has enjoyed freedom even till the date of this appeal been argued having only

spent two months in ren,and despite been convicted for a serious fraud case where

premeditation was manifest.

In the case of DHANANJOY CHATTERJEE-Vs- STATE OF W.B. (1994) 2 SCC 220, it was held that, "The imposition of appropriate punishment is the manner in which the Court responds to the society's cry for justice against the criminal. Justice demands that Court should impose punishment befitting the crime so that the Courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime. The court must not only keep in view the rights of the criminal but also the rights of the victim of the crime and the society at large while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment".

SEVAKA PERUMAL etc. Vs. STATE OF TAMIL NADU AIR (1991) SC 1463, held that, "Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats. It is therefore the duty of every court to award proper sentence having regard to the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc."

MAHESH Vs STATE OF MP (1987) 2 SCR 710, In refusing to reduce the death sentence

observed that "It will be a mockery of justice to permit the accused to escape the extreme penalty of law when faced with such evidence and such cruel acts. To give the lesser punishment

8

I

i

for the appellants would be to render the justice system of the country 'suspect'. The common man will lose faith in courts. In such cases, he understands and appreciates the language of deterrence more than the reformative jargon".

By considering above, it is abundantly clear that there is no reason to reverse the conviction or

reduce the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge and thereby we affirm the

conviction and the sentence.

Hereby the Appeal is dismissed.
