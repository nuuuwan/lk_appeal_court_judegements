L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an application by the state to review the sentence imposed

by the High Court.

Court issued notice on the Accused Respondent on several times

under registered post but the Accused Respondent was absent and

unrepresented. Since the notices not returned undelivered, it was

presumed that the notices were duly served on the Accused Respondent.

The Accused Respondent together with another person who died

subsequently, was indicted before the High Court of Colombo. The

charges against the Accused Respondent are,

1. During the period between 4.3.2002 and 14.11.2002 the Accused

Respondent committed the offence of conspiracy to commit

cheating by agreeing to tender a forged deed to one Sarath Earl

Wickramasinghe Gunasekara to sell a house and a plot of land

located at no. 96, Stace Road, Grandpass in Colombo for Rs.

625,0001- an offence punishable under section 403 of the Penal

Code read with section 102 and 113 B of the code.

2. That in the same time, place and the same cause of transaction the

Accused Respondent committed the offence of using as a genuine a

forged document by tendering a forged deed to the aforementioned

Sarath Earl Wickramasinghe Gunasekara, an offence punishable

under section 459 of the Penal Code.

4. That in the same time, place and the same cause of transaction the

Accused Respondent committed cheating by causmg

aforementioned Sarath Earl Wickramasinghe Gunasekara to

purchase aforementioned house and plot of land located at 96,

Stace Road, Grandpass in Colombo for Rs. 625,0001- an offence

punishable under section 403 of the Penal Code.

The brief background of the case is that the Accused Respondent is

the brother of the prosecution witness (PW) no.l. Since the PW 1 was

residing in USA, the Accused Respondent was entrusted to look after the

land and the house. He prepared a forged deed to show that the house

belonged to him and sold it.

After serving the indictment, the Accuse Respondent pleaded not

guilty and the case proceeded to trial. On conclusion of the PW l' s

evidence, the Accused Respondent pleaded guilty to the charges no. I, 2

and 4. On his own plea he was convicted and sentenced as follows.

1. Charge 1. 6 months Rl suspended for 5 years.

In addition Rs. 100,0001- to be paid to the PW 1 as

compensation with a default term of 1 year.

2. Charge 2. 1 year Rl suspended for 5 years.

In addition Rs. 300,0001- to be paid to the PW 3,

Sarath Earl Wickramasinghe Gunasekara as

compensation with a default term of 1 year.

3. Charge 4. 6 months Rl suspended for 5 years.

The AG disagreed with this sentence and moved in revision to

enhance the punishment. The learned DSG's contention is that the PW 1

will have to vindicate her title in a civil Court to get the forged deed

canceled and it is a time consuming effort and will costly. Therefore she

move that compensation awarded to the PW 1 to be re considered.

Further the punishment for the offence in charge no. 4 carries a

mandatory fine and the learned High Court Judge has not imposed a fine.

During the trial, a long and protracted discussion on the payment of

compensation to the PW 3 has taken place and finally the Counsel for the

Accused Respondent has informed that the PW 3 has agreed to accept Rs.

4

300,0001- as compensation from the Accused Respondent. The plea of

guilt was tendered only after reaching this arraignment. The learned High

Court Judge has ordered to pay Rs. 300,0001- as compensation to PW 3.

As per the learned DSG, PW 1 will have to vindicate her title in a

civil suit. In such an action the fact that the deed holder, the PW 3, was

paid compensation for the forgery that he was subjected to, will become a

relevant fact. Therefore, I suppose that a case of that nature will not be

time consuming as the learned DSG expects. As such the compensation

awarded to the PW 1 cannot be said insufficient.

Charges no. 1 and 4 are for offences punishable under section 403

of the Penal code. This section contains a mandatory term of fine. The

section reads thus;

Whoever cheats and there by dishonestly induces the person

deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter,

or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security, or anything

which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted

into a valuable security, shall be punished with imprisonment of

either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and

shall also be liable to fine

In imposing a sentence the Court has to consider the conduct of the

Accused Respondent in relation to the offence committed by him, such

as, the facts that he has breached the trust placed on him by his own

sister, the amount of planning put into commit the offence, and the time

he has taken to plead guilty to the offence. He was benefited by

committing this crime and enjoyed the fruits of the crime for a long time.

Considering these factors, I act in revision, alter the sentence

imposed on charges 1 and 4 only by adding a fine of Rs. 25,0001- in

addition to the punishment imposed by the learned High Court Judge on

charges 1 and 4. The other sentences imposed by the learned High Court

Judge are affirmed.

Accordingly the sentences imposed on the Accused Respondent for

the charges 1, 2 and 4 will be as follows.

Charge 1. 6 months RI suspended for 5 years.

Rs. 25,0001-fine in default 3 months simple

imprisonment.

In addition Rs. 100,0001- to be paid to the PW 1 as

compensation with a default term of 1 year.

Charge 2. 1 year RI suspended for 5 years.

In addition Rs. 300,0001- to be paid to the PW 3,

Sarath Earl Wickramasinghe Gunasekara as

compensation with a default term of 1 year.

Charge 4. 6 months RI suspended for 5 years.

Rs. 25,0001-fine in default 3 months simple

imprisonment.

The learned High Court Judge is to consider whether it is necessary

to grant time to pay the fine and make an appropriate order.
