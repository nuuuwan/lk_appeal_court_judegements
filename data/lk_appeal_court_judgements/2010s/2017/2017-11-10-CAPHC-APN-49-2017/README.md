ORDER

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Petitioner) has filed this revision application seeking to set aside the order

dated 2017-03-08 made by the High Court holden in Colombo. This order

has been produced marked 'A'.

Upon the Petitioner supporting this case ex Parte, this Court had issued an

interim order staying the proceedings of the Arbitral Tribunal as has been

prayed for in prayer (f) of the petition.

As the Respondent - Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Respondent) had objected to the extension of the said stay order this

Court heard submissions of learned counsel for both parties and concluded

the inquiry pertaining to the said issue.

This Court reserved its order affording an opportunity for both parties to

tender written submissions in support of their respective positions.

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner sought to argue that the

jurisdiction to call for, inspect and examine any record of any Court of first

5

Instance conferred on the Court of Appeal by Article 145 of the

Constitution is not subject to any law and hence has conferred an

unfettered jurisdiction. It was on that basis that he submitted that Article

145 is an entrenched provision in the Constitution.

Although the Petitioner has made this application under Article 145 of the

Constitution, it is by Article 138 that the Constitution confers revisionary

jurisdiction on this Court. A closer look at Article 138 shows that this Court

is required to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction subject to the provisions

of the Constitution or of any law. This position is rather clear in the Sinhala

version of the Constitution.

Indeed when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was promulgated it

was Article 138 which the legislature amended to make it possible for the

Court of appeal to assume revisionary and appellate jurisdiction in respect

of orders pronounced by the Provincial High Court in its exercise of, new

jurisdiction which the 13th Amendment conferred on it. It is to be noted

that 13tn Amendment never amended Article 145. Therefore, it is the view

of this Court that Article 145 merely sets out yet another step that this

6

Court can take when it exercises revisionary jurisdiction vested in it under

Article 138. Indeed any order that the Court of Appeal may make when it

invokes its power to call for, inspect and examine any record will be in the

exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. This is manifest by the word 'and'

contained in Article 145 itself. It would be helpful to reproduce Article 145

which is as follows;

" .... The Court of Appeal may, ex mero motu or on any application made,

call for, inspect and examine any record of any Court of First Instance and

in the exercise of its revisionary powers may make any order thereon as

the interests of justice may require .... " (/ have highlighted the word 'and?

Therefore this Court is unable to accept the argument of the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner that Article 145 confers an unfettered

jurisdiction which is independent of Article 138.

The Supreme Court in the case of Atapattu and others Vs. People's Bank

and others!, having considered the provisions in several relevant Articles in

the Constitution, held that the powers vested in Court of Appeal under

Article 140 is notdiminished by a provision in the ordinary law because the

11997 (1) 5 L R 208.

7

said Article 140 is couched in such a way that it would only be (unlike

Article 126) "subject to the provisions of the Constitution". This is because

the Constitution has not subjected Article 140 to other ordinary laws.

However wordings appear in Article 138 is not the same and is couched in

a way that the constitution itself has subjected the provisions in Article 138

to 'any law'. Artcicle 170 of the Constitution interprets "law" as any Act of

Parliament, and any law enacted by any legislation at any time prior to the

commencement of the Constitution and includes an Order in Council.

The Supreme Court in the case of Weragama V Eksath Lanka Wathu

Kamkaru Samithiya2 stated as follows; "However, the jurisdiction of the

Court of Appeal under Article 138 is not an entrenched jurisdiction,

because Article 138 provides that it is subject to the provisions "of any

law"; hence it was always constitutionally permissible for that jurisdiction to

be reduced or transferred by ordinary law (of course, to a body entitled to

exercise judicial power) ...... "

Therefore, to ascertain whether this Court can exercise its revisionary

jurisdiction in the instant case, one needs to turn to the relevant law

21984 (1) Sri. L.R. 293.

8

applicable to arbitration proceedings. That is found in section 37(1) of the

Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995. For convenience it is reproduced below;

section 37(1)

Subject to sub section (2) of this section, no appeal or revision shall lie in

respect of any order, judgment or decree of the High Court in the exercise

of its jurisdiction under this Act except from an order, judgment or decree

of the High Court, under this part of this Act.

(2) An appeal shall lie from an order, judgment or decree of the High Court

referred to in subsection (1) to the Supreme Court only on a question of

law and with the leave of the Supreme Court first obtained.

The above provisions show that one can lodge an appeal to the Supreme

Court with leave only against the orders made under the provisions in part

VII of the Act. Thus, it is to be observed that an appeal is only possible in

respect of the orders pertaining to applications for the enforcements of

arbitral awards.

The above provision is dealing with the appeals and revisions against

orders made by the High Court. The only Court, which has revisionary

. juri~diction in respect of orders made by the High Court, is the Court of

9

Appeal. This means that section 37 (1) has taken away the revisionary

jurisdiction of Court of Appeal in respect of any order, judgment or decree

of the High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the Arbitration Act

No. 11 of 1995 other than those made under part VII of the said Act.

The application made by the Petitioner to the High Court is under the

provisions of section 11 of the Arbitration Act seeking a determination by

the High Court on the question whether the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction

to conduct the instant arbitration. The Petitioners had also sought an

interim relief to stay the proceedings of the arbitral tribunal until final

determination of the said question by the High Court. Learned High Court

Judge by the impugned order dated 2017-03-08 had refused the said

interim relief. It is that order that is being canvassed before this Court by

the Petitioner in the instant revision application.

It is common ground that what the interim order issued by this Court has

stayed is the proceedings of the Arbitral Tribunal.

Thus, it is clear that this revision application has been filed to revise an

order of the High Court in respect of which the revisionary jurisdiction of

this Court has been taken away by section 37 (1) of the Arbitration Act.

10

The Supreme Court had taken the view that the involvement of Courts in

arbitration proceedings should be limited only to those provided for in the

Arbitration Act. This is clear from the following passage quoted below from

the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Light Weight Body

Armour Ltd. V Sri Lanka Army.3

" ... Arbitration is an alternate means of dispute resolution which has been

introduced and developed in order to reduce the amount of time spent in

litigation. In this light, the Arbitration Act contemplates that the arbitral

award is not susceptible and not vulnerable to any challenge except that

permitted under the Act. This is on the basis that it is conclusive as a

judgment between the two parties and could only be set aside on the

grounds explicitly set out in section 32 of the Act. The onus of proving that,

if fell within the ambit of the said provision lies on the party making such

an application. The legislative intend behind the Act is clearly that a degree

of finality attaches to the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal, which is the

judge of both, questions of fact and law referred to it. .... "

3 2007 Bar Association Law Reports 10.

11

For the foregoing reasons, this Court is of the view that it does not have

jurisdiction to entertain the instant revision application.

Therefore, this Court decides not to extend the stay order it had earlier

granted as an interim relief. As this issue has been raised as a preliminary

objection with regard to jurisdiction and since this Court has held that it

has no jurisdiction to entertain this application, this Court decides to

dismiss this application. No costs ordered.

This revision application must therefore stand dismissed without costs.
