In the instant case the learned High Court Judge found the Accused-

Appellant(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) guilty on three

charges preferred by the Hon AG on 15.04.2006. The nature of the charges

were;

1. Committing the offence of kidnapping of the deceased against the

guardian of the deceased.

2. Committing the offence of Grave Sexual Abused against the deceased on

the same transaction and

3. Committing the offence of murder of the deceased during the course of

the same transaction

The learned High Court Judge sentenced the Appellant for 10 years rigorous

imprisonment onl st and 2nd counts and the Appellant was sentenced to death on

the 3rd count.

Being aggrieved by the aforesaid sentence imposed by the learned High Court

Judge the Appellant preferred the instant appeal on the following grounds;

1. The Procedure adopted by the learned trial judge is contrary to the

provisions of Section 165 of the Evidence Ordinance and violates the

norms and principles of the adversarial system of Criminal Justice.

2. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider or evaluate the

standards and reliability of DNA evidence adduced before the trial

applying internationally accepted tests and by failing to do so denied a

fair trial to the accused.

3. The DNA scientist who obtained the blood samples of the accused for

DNA testing was not called to give evidence by the prosecution and the

learned High Court judge has failed to consider the said irregularity in

procedure favourable to the accused.

4. The items of circumstantial evidence are not sufficient to prove the

prosecution's case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.

When looking at the evidence presented by the prosecution it is evident that the

prosecution's case has been based on circumstantial evidence against the

Appellant in this case.

Therefore before discussing the aforesaid grounds of appeal submitted by the

Appellant it would be prudent to evaluate the evidence elucidated by the

prosecution in order to arrive at a conclusion.

Following are the items of circumstantial evidence produced against the

Appellant.

PW1, PW2 and PW3 are the father, mother and the uncle of the 6 year old

deceased respectively. According to the evidence of aforesaid three witnesses

the incident had occurred on 15.04.2006 consequent toPW3 bringing the

Appellant to the house of the PW1and PW2.

According PW3, who is the uncle of the deceased, the Appellant was known to

him and since the date of the incident was the day after the Sinhala and Tamil

New Year PW3 had visited his sister PW2 to have lunch at her house. The

Appellant had also accompanied PW3. Before lunch,as admitted by allthe

.' ".!!r----I!&j",W~jt?:'t'-.. ~ ....

l P f

4

witness,the Appellant and PWI (father of the deceased) had consumed liquor.

After they had lunch the deceased was seen seatedon the front bike bar ridden

by the Appellant who was doing rounds around the house.

According to PWI at one occasion the deceased had come to him and had

requested for Rs. 10/- to accompany the Appellant to buy chocolate from the

nearby boutique. The witness had given the deceased Rs. 10/- and finally saw

the deceased and the Appellant leaving towards the boutique on the bicycle.

Few minutes later since there was no trace of the two of them he had gone in

search of the deceased and met the Appellant near a sugar cane plantation

coming from the direction from where the deceased's body was subsequently

found. Thereafter, when the Appellant was questioned as to the whereabouts of

the deceased the Appellant had replied that the deceased 6 year old boy had got

off near the boutique and he was unaware of his whereabouts. This was the

position taken by the Appellant in his defence.

However, the prosecution was able to produce the following items of

circumstantial evidence against the accused;

At the first instance although the Appellant had denied having any knowledge

of the whereabouts of the deceased, the evidence of PW 6 who was a neighbour

of the deceased, PW15 who was the boutique owner and PW4 who found the

body of the deceased, it was established with cogent evidence that it was the

Appellant who was seen accompanying the deceased to the boutique.

Considering the evidence of PW6, PW15 and PW4 all of whom had no

personal connection to either the deceased nor the Appellant it may be said that

this evidence presented by the prosecution is unbiased and independent in

contrast to the position taken by Appellant with regard to the evidence of PW1,

PW2 and PW3 which allegedly was bias due to the close relationship they

shared with the deceased.

I r I t

~ t f I t I!

~ f I III

f l I

However, the learned High Court Judge has correctly evaluated the room for

bias in each of these witnesses by giving due regard to the relationship between

each of the said witnesses and the deceased and thereafter, in judgment (vide

pages 440 - 450 of the Appeal brief), presents a comprehensive narrative as to

why the contention of bias raised by the Appellant against PWl, PW2 and PW

should fail.

Notwithstanding the aforesaid findings of the learned High Court Judge in

relation to the evidence of PWl, PW2 and PW3,as per the evidence of PW6,

PW 15 and PW 4 this Court is of the view that the prosecution was able to infer

strong circumstantial evidence against the Appellant.

According to PWl5,the boutique owner, it was admitted that the deceased came

to her boutique to buy 2 chocolates whilst an unknown person was waiting for

the deceased 10-12 meters away. Although this unknown person was not

identified by PW15 she was able to identify the sarong worn by this person (P9)

and therefore the prosecution was able to draw the nexus that it was the

Appellant who was waiting for the deceased outside the boutique.

The said position was corroborated in evidence with the testimonies ofPW6 and

PW 4 who were neighbouring villagers and independent witnesses. According to

PW 6 he stated in evidence that he saw the Appellant taking the deceased on his

bicycle towards the said boutique around 12.30 pm. According to PW4 it was

he who found the body of the deceased at a nearby bush. The mother of the

deceased testified in Court that she saw the Appellant taking the deceased on his

bicycle towards the area where the body was found. Apart from this testimony

PW 4 stated in evidence that he followed the bicycle tire tracks which led tothe

area where the body was found.

The second phase of the prosecution commenced with the official testimony of

PW12Prof Ruwan Illeperuma who gave evidence on the DNA data, thereafter

I

I

t Il ,

I

71 I 6

PWlO Inspector of Police Rohana, who conducted the police investigation, gave

evidence followed by PWl4 Dr. M.N. Rahulhaq the Judical Medical Officer

who performed the post-mortem on the deceased. The official testimonies of

PWI2, PWIO and PWl4 were of such nature that it supported the inference of

guilt of the Appellant drawn by the prosecution.

The evidence of PWI 0 narrated thecourse of investigations subsequent to the

body of the deceased been discovered and the nexus to the Appellant. This

evidence propounded the exact location from which the body was discovered

and the manner in which the body was found and the way in which the inquest

was held and most importantly how two hairswere found on the thigh of the

deceased close to the genitals.

The DNA evidence based on these two hairs compared to a blood sample

obtained from the Appellant was thereafter presented as evidence through

PWl2 and according to the evidence of PWl2 it was successfully established

that the hair found on the thigh of the deceased belonged to the Appellant.

This finding corroborates the evidence of PWl4 who gave evidence regarding

the Post Mortem Report prepared by Consultant Judicial Medical Officer

Dr.Ruwanpura. It is vital to note at this stage that the learned High Court Judge

in his judgment referred to the provisions contained in the Criminal Procedure

Code and correctly explained when a post-mortem report prepared by one

Judicial Medical Officer could be led through another Judicial Medical Officer

at a trial and how that piece of evidence would become admissible.

The Post Mortem Reportwas marked as P3 during the trial and from these

findings it was opined that there had been anal intercourse. Therefore, it is

incumbent to note the grave circumstances under which the hairs of the

Appellant could have fallen on the thigh of the deceased close to the genitalsand

7

further the cause of the two abrasions found on the tip of the penis of the

deceased labelled injury numbers 8 and 9.

It was revealed in P3 that the death of the deceased child had been caused due to

ligature strangulation and the cord which was used to hang a pendent around the

neck of the deceased was observed to be the mode used by the Appellant to kill

the deceased.

Contrary to the aforesaid position by the prosecution the Appellant took up the

defence of total denial and from perusing the judgment it appeared that the

learned High Court Judge had accurately evaluated the case for the prosecution

first and thereafter considered whether the defence taken up by the Appellant

was sufficient to create a reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution.

The defence taken up by the Appellant was that it was PW3, the uncle of the

deceased, who took the deceased to the boutique and not the Appellant as

narrated by the prosecution. In his defence the Appellant stated that at the time

PW3 brought the deceased to the boutique the Appellantallegedly was also at

the boutique. Thereafter PW3 had left the boutique with the deceased and whilst

leaving the boutique some villagers had come and assaulted him and handed

him over to the police and further that at the Police Station two hairs were

allegedly forcibly removed from the Appellant.

In the case of the King v. Appuhamy 46NLR 128 it was held that in order to

justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial evidence, the

inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the accused and

incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable-hypothesis that of his guilt.

In the instant case as correctly evaluated by the learned High Court Judge it is

incumbenton the prosecution to establish a strong nexus between the guilt of the

Appellant and the death of the deceased. From the evidence of PWI ,PW2 and

PW3 it is clearthat the Appellant removed the deceased from the house. The

r

i /

I'

8

evidence of PW6 and PW15 establishes that the Appellant was seen with the

deceased riding a bike towards the boutique at one point and that the Appellant

was waiting for the deceased 10-12 meters away from the boutique when the

deceased came to buy chocolates. PW2 had seen the Appellant riding the

bicycle with the deceased towards the area where the body was discovered afew

hours after the disappearance of the deceased and the Appellant. The evidence

of PW4 admitted that from the aforementioned clues he was able to find the

body by following the tire tracks left behind from a bicycle which lead towards

the cane shrubs.

As fittingly observed by the learned High Court Judge the Appellant never

raised a defence to any of the above witness testimony by contending thatthe

Appellant was at the boutique after which PW3 took the deceased with him.

Neither of the said prosecution witnesses were suggested nor questioned on

whetherthe Appellant was at the boutique when PW3 brought the deceased to

the boutique, as per the version of the Defence. Further, as observed by the

learned High Court Judge it is apparent that the accused had taken

upvaryingpositions when questioned about the whereabouts of the deceased.

Firstly, when he was questioned before the discovery of the body the Appellant

had taken the position that he dropped the deceased at the boutique. The

Appellant's dock statement set forth acontrasting position, that the Appellant

never took the deceased with him to the bou~ique and that it was PW3 who took

the deceased on his bicycle.

Based on the forgoing discrepancy in the Defence's version of the events that

led to the death of a 6 year old boy,the learned High Court Judge refused to

accept the defence and acted upon the strong evidence adduced against the

Appellant by the prosecution. The view of this court too is that the dock

statement of the Appellant is not sufficient and is incapable of raising any

reasonable doubt in the case for the prosecution.

I

This Court is of the view that meticulous analysis and reasoning presented by

the learned High Court Judge to reject the defence and to act upon the items of

evidence elucidated by the prosecution is correct in law and the defence of total

denial raised by the Appellant is an improbable and unacceptable defence which

may have been suggested as an afterthought.

Having evaluated the evidence of the prosecution I shall now consider whether

the grounds of appeal raised by the Appellant would suffice to negate the

aforesaid findings of the learned High Court Judge in support of the innocence

of the accused.

The first point raised by the Appellant is that the procedure adopted by the

learned High Court Judge is contrary to the Section 165 of the evidence

ordinance and such procedure violates the norms and the principles of the

adversarial system of criminal justice.

Section 165 of the evidence ordinance reads as follows;

"The Judge may, in order to discover or to obtain proper proof of relevant

facts, ask any question he pleases, in any form, at any time, of any

witness, or of the parties, about any fact relevant or irrelevant ; and may

order the production of any document or thing ; and neither the parties

nor their agents shall be entitled to make any objection to any such

question or order, nor, without the leave of the court, to cross-examine

any witness upon any answer given in reply to any such question:

Provided that the judgment must be based upon facts declared by this

Ordinance to be relevant and duly proved;

Provided also that this section shall not authorize any Judge to compel

any witness to answer any question, or to produce any document, which

10

such witness would be entitled to refuse to answer or produce under

sections 121 to 131 both inclusive, if the question were asked or the

document were called for by the adverse party; nor shall the Judge ask

any question which it would be improper for any other person to ask

under section 148 or 149 ; nor shall he dispense with primary evidence of

any document, excepting the cases herein before excepted."

This Court observes that the nature of questioning adopted by the learned High

Court Judge,as pointed out by the Appellant during argument stage andpages 5

and 6 of his written submissions, have not unfairly prejudiced the Appellant and

is not such that would alter the character of the adversarial system of criminal

justice. One could say that the learned High Court Judge was an active listener

though the trial process.

As stated in the section it is apparent that the line of questioning adopted by the

learned High Court Judge during the trial was well within the scope of Section

165 and was in order to discover or to obtain the proper proof of the relevant

facts and not to cause any prejudice to the Appellant as this is a case of

circumstantial evidence.

The Counsel for the Appellant contends that the questionsraised by the learned

High Court Judge at page 325 of the appeal brief are contrary to Section 165

aforementioned. However, this Court sees that no unfair prejudice was caused

to the Appellant since the learned Trial Judge never compelled the witness to

give a favourable answer to the prosecution but simply inquired as to whether

the witness could identify the person on the bicycle if he was seen again.

It is prudent to note that as per page 145 of the appeal brief after questioning the

Judicial Medical Officer the learned Trial Judge afforded an opportunity to both

the defence and prosecution to seek clarity on any matter that was revealed

though the questions raised by the learned High Court Judge but however both

7/

" , 11

the defence and the prosecution waived that opportunity. The said section is

reproduced below;

Considering the above conduct of the learned High Court Judge, one may

suppose that the learned High Court Judge was well aware of the scope of

Section 165 and therefore had acted within the parameters of the said provision.

Although the learned Counsel for the Appellant submitted a number of

authorities including some English judgments in support of his contention this

court sees no relevance with the findings of the said authorities and the line of

questioning adopted by the learned High Court Judge in the instant case.

The second ground of Appeal urged by the learned Counsel for the Appellant is

that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider or evaluate the

standards and reliability of DNA evidence adduced before the trial applying

internationally accepted tests and by failing to do so denied a fair trial to the

accused. The Counsel for the Appellant submits a number of foreign authorities

in support of this contention. Hence, I will briefly consider their relevance. At

the outset, the nature of the expert evidence led in the said cases must be

distinguished from that of the instant case. The case of Cobey V s. State 73, Md.

App. 233(Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1988) is concerned with the expert evidence

relating to a technique known as Chromosome Variant Analysis in which the

cell tissues of an aborted foetus was compared to a sample. The case of Daubert,

f'

/

12

Vs. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786 1992

relates to a case in which Court determined whether a prescription antinausea

drug cased birth defects. The underlining rational discussed in these cases is the

"general acceptance"test as formulated in the case of Frye Vs. United States 293

F. 1013 (D.C. Cir 1923) i.e. that "the thing from which the deduction is made

must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the

particular field in which it belongs."

In the instant case the learned High Court Judge relies on the expert evidence of

PW12 and his extensive experience and qualifications on the subject matter in

proof of the DNA evidence. PW12 in his evidence testifies to the internationally

accepted testing methods adopted in analysing the DNA data thereby one may

reliably determine the "general acceptance"of this method vis-a-vis the

evidence.

It is prudent to note that the learned High Court Judge does not solely rely on

the DNA evidence but considers it in tandem with the strong circumstantial

evidence to hold the Appellant guilty of the said chargers. In such a context the

second ground of Appeal should fail.

With regard to the third ground of Appeal raised by the Counsel for the defence

this court sees no merit in that argument as the prosecution has been able to

established the chain of the production intact till the analysis was carried out.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant contends that the learned High Court

Judge has improperly evaluatedthe transfer of the blood samplesfrom the crime

scene to the laboratory where it was tendered for the analysis during the course

of the investigations.

This Court observes that from pages 448 - 451 of the Judgment that the learned

High Court Judge has directed his judicial mind to this contention and thereafter

presented sound reasoning concerning the acceptance of the PW 12' s evidence.

I i i J f i l

r I r I

7>/

I ! 13

In relation to the impugned blood sample as claimed by the defence it is

apparent that the learned High Court Judge had given a proper account

regarding the chain of evidence of the intact productions by referring to the

evidence and the documents which were marked as P5 -P7(b) before evaluating

the evidence by PW12.

Therefore,this Court sees no reason to reject the findings of the learned High

Court Judge relating to the evidence of PW12 or the DNA evidence as

contended by the Appellant.

In addition to the aforesaid grounds of Appeal the Counsel for the Appellant

further alleged that the elucidated items of circumstantial evidence were

insufficient to prove the prosecution's case against the accused beyond

reasonable doubt.

The only ground urged by the counsel to support the above argument is the

failure of PW15 to identify the accused at the trial. However it should not be

forgotten that PW15 had not totally failed to identify the person who waited 10-

12 meters away from PW15. PW15 successfully identified P9, the sarong worn

by the Appellant at the scene of the crime, as the attire of the said unknown

person. The evidence of prosecution connected P9 to the accused which was the

sarong the Appellant wore at the time of the incident.

Finally, it was alleged by the Counsel for the Appellant that the learned High

Court Judge had erred in law when evaluating the evidence regarding the

concept of the last seen with the deceased.

In order to substantiate the aforesaid contention the learned Counsel submits

that the case for the prosecution breaks at the point when PW15 failed to

identify the proper culprit who waited for the deceased till he returned from the

boutique after buying the two chocolates. Therefore it is urged by the Counsel

that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt.

IIt

tf K I1I

14

However, when observing the concept of the last seen with the deceased one

must give due regard to its applicability in a case of criminal trial.

In the case of The King V. Appuhamy 46 N.L.R 128 it was held that, III

considering the force and effect of circumstantial evidence, in a trial for murder,

the fact that the deceased was last seen in the company of the accused loses a

considerable part of its significance if the prosecutor has failed to fix the exact

time of death of the deceased.

In the cases of State of Uttar Pradesh v. Satish, AIR 2005 se

1000andRamreddy Rajesh Khanna Reddy and another v. State of Andhra

Pradesh (2006) 10 see 172 it was held that the last seen theory comes into

play when the time gap between the point of time when the accused and the

deceased were last seen alive and when the deceased is found dead is sosmall

that the possibility of any person other than the accused being the author of the

crimebecomes impossible.

Therefore, it is incumbent that for the concept of the last seen to be relied upon

the prosecution has to establish the last seen withinc10se proximity to the time

of death in any given situation.

However, when observing the evidence of the prosecution it is apparent that the

prosecution has never relied upon the concept of last seen with the deceased in

the given case as there had been number of strong circumstantial evidence

available against the Appellant.

Even if this court is to evaluate the final ground urged by the counsel for the

defence it is evident that the prosecution has been able to establish strong

circumstantial evidence against the Appellant that it was him and not any other

15

person who waited 10-12 meters away from the PW15 on that day till the

deceased returned from the boutique. The learned High Court Judge had also

considered this and arrived at the same conclusion.

Therefore, this court finds no merit in this contention as raised by the leaned

counsel for the defence.

In the case of Don Sunny v. AG 1998 2 SLR lwhich discussed the principles

on which a trial judge should follow in a case purely based on circumstantial

evidence.

1. When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the

proved items of circumstantial evidence when taken together must

irresistibly point towards the only inference that the accused

committed the offence.

On a consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can be

arrived at should be consistent with the guilt ofthe accused only.

2. If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an

inference can be drawn which is consistent with the innocence of the

accused, then one cannot say th~t the charges have been proved

beyond reasonable doubt.

3. If upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence

if the only inference that can be drawn is that the accused committed

the offence then they can be found guilty.

The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had the

opportunity of committing the offence, the accused can be found guilty only and

, ! j t I .! 16 i

! ! only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt

and inconsistent with their innocence.

In the case in hand when evaluating the judgment it is prudent that the learned

High Court Judge in this case had correctly applied the principles set out in the

above case when evaluating the each and every piece of circumstantial evidence

against the accused.

Therefore this court is of the view that the learned High Court Judgehad not

erred in law as claimed by the Appellant when finding the Appellant guilty of

all three charges preferred against him.

Considering all the matters therefore, this court see no reason to interfere with

the judgement of the learned High Court Judge and we proceed to dismiss the

appeal. We affirm the conviction and the sentence imposed on the Appellant.

Appeal Dismissed.
