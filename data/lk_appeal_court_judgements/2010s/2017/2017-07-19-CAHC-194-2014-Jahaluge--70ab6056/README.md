The Accused Appellant (Accused) was indicted in the High Court of

Monaragala on a charge of rape punishable under section 365 of the Penal

Code.

The victim was a 75 years old at the time of the incident and was 80

years when she gave evidence in the High Court. According to the

prosecutrix while she was sleeping in the night, on the day of the incident,

she heard a noise from the roof. She lit the torch light and directed towards

the roof and saw that the Accused coming down from the roof after

removing tiles. She has scolded the Accused accusing that he was the person

who was steeling the things from her house on previous occasions too.

Thereafter she has opened the front door and tried to get out of the house but

the Accused has dragged her in to the house and put her to the bed and

raped her. During the incident of rape she has struggled with the Accused

and at one time she fell down to the ground but Accused overpowered her

and committed the rape.

The Accused do not deny the fact that he entered in to the house of

the victim trough the roof. In fact the learned Counsel for the Accused

suggested in the cross examination that the Accused has come in to the

house through the roof. Therefore the first part of the incident, that is, the

3

Accused entering in to the house of the victim is not in dispute. In this setup

the Accused cannot challenge the identity. On the other hand the Accused is

a relative and the victim has identified him with the help of the torch light.

Even after the sexual act, ha has spent some time in the house eating mango.

The prosecutrix had ample time to identify the Accused.

The Counsel for the Accused appellant argues that the evidence of the

victim was not corroborated on material points and therefore it is not safe to

convict the Accused. As I stated earlier the Accused admitted or not denied

entering in to the house of the victim through the roof in the night. The

victim was staying alone in the house and that fact is also not denied. The

evidence of the victim on the incident was not contradicted on any point.

The Counsel questions about the injuries. His contention is that if

such an incident took place, she should have suffered more injuries. The

victim is an old lady of 75 years of age. The resistance that a lady of that

age can offer to a young man of 25 years cannot be very high. She does not

say that she was dragged through the floor, what she says is that she was

dragged to the bed. In these circumstances, the victim having only two

injuries cannot be considered in favour of the Accused.

The Counsel for the Accused submits that the Accused tried to get out

from the house and the prosecutrix struggled to prevent the escape of the

Accused and the injuries inflicted at that time. This suggestion is not

probable. The victim, as ! said earlier, being is an old and feeble woman it is

not probable that she will try to prevent the escape of the Accused.

Especially in a situation where she was all alone in that house and there is

no house nearby. The police testified to the fact that there is no house

nearby. The Doctor testified that those injuries could have been inflicted due

to a fall. The witness testified that she fell from the bed.

4

The contention of the Counsel for the Accused is that there was no

rape or any sexual harassment took place, but only the Accused entered in to

the house. He further submits that the prosecutrix has made a false

complaint to the police against the Accused because she believed that the

Accused was the person who was stealing her things and further he was

making adverse comments regarding her relationship with the person called

Pareekshaka. I don't see any reason for the victim to be annoyed on making

comments regarding the said relationship because she being a lady deserted

by her husband long time ago and being admitted that she has a relationship

with the said Pareekshaka, the said relationship looks like an open secret. It

is not very probable that in the Sri Lankan society, a lady of this age will

make a false complaint of rape just to take revenge or to prevent the

Accused from coming to her house. Therefore the defense assertion that the

rape is a fabrication is not probable.

The victim said in evidence that she went to the Priyantha's shop after

the incident and told him what happened and requested him to telephone her

daughter in law. The daughter in law has come there with her son and

thereafter they have gone to the police post. Though the said Priyantha was

listed as a witness, prosecution was unable to call him to give evidence

because he has left the country during the trial, but the daughter in law was

called to give evidence.

The daughter in law of the victim Gamage Sujatha Pushpakanthi

testified to the fact that she received a telephone call in the night of the date

of incident and came to the Priyantha's shop. According this witness, her

mother was crying when she came. The victim has divulged the tragic

incident to the daughter. She has gone to the police post with the mother to

complaint about the incident. Without any delay the victim has complaint to

the closest person and to the police.

5

The Doctor has said that the two injuries found in her body are

compatible with a fall. The witness said that she fell down to the ground

from the bed. She being a mother of several children there is a possibility

that her genital parts not be injured in a sexual intercourse. The Counsel

argues that there should be more injuries but it depends on how much

resistance that she can offer. As I said earlier she is old lady of 75 years at

the time if the incident.

During the Police investigations it was found that there were foot

prints on the wall suggesting that a person has come through the roof. The

Accused admitted that he came in to the house through the roof.

The Counsel for the Accused argues that there is no corroboration. In

the case of The King V. Atukorale 50 NLR 256 it has been held that where

an Accused is charged with rape, corroboration of the story of the

prosecutrix must come from some independent quarter and not from the

prosecutrix herself. A complaint made by the prosecutrix to the Police in

which she implicated the Accused cannot be regarded as corroboration of

her evidence. In the instant case the prosecutrix complained to her daughter

and thereafter to the police. It is a complaint made without delay but not

corroboration. Her evidence, as I said earlier, was without any infirmities

and contradictions or omissions. A material part of the incident, which is

entering in to the house through the roof in the night, was not denied. The

defense of the Accused that the prosecutrix tried to prevent his escape is not

probable. Under these circumstances, the Court can rely on the evidence of

the prosecutrix. In the case of Inoka Gallage V. Kamal Addararachchi and

another [2002] 1 Sri L R 307 it has been held that;

Corroboration is not a sine qua non for a conviction in a rape case. It

is only a rule of prudence. If the evidence of the victim does not suffer

from basic infirmity and the probability factor does not render it

6

unworthy of credence, as a general rule there is no reason to insist on

corroboration. But, in a trial without a jury there must be an

indication in the judgment that the judge had this rule in mind.

The Counsel argue that the police has failed to produce the cloths that

the victim and the Accused were wearing and the bed sheets for forensic

analysis and not submitting the Accused for a medical examination.

Counsel's argument is that this failure has to be considered under section

114 * of the Evidence Ordinance as non production of the evidence that

could have produced in favour of the Accused. I do not agree with this

argument. If the police had the analysis report and failed to produce that

evidence, it can be considered as not producing the evidence unfavorable to

the prosecution. In this instance it is a failure in the part of the investigation.

The investigation officers would have gathered the forensic evidence by

doing a proper investigation. Not tendering the evidence which was not

available, cannot be considered under section 114.

I see no reason to interfere with the finding of the learned High Court

Judge.

I affirm the conviction and the sentence. Appeal dismissed.
