Decided on 17/07/2017

M.M.A.Gaffoor,J.

The 1 st and 2nd accused-appellants were indicted, on a count of murder

in the High Court of Galle, for having committed the murder of one Pilana

Gamage Siripala, on 12/04/2006. After the conclusion of the trial, the

learned trial Judge convicted both appellants on the count of murder and

sentenced them to death on the 06/512009.

The 1 st appellant and the deceased were husband and wife. The 2nd

appellant was their neighbour with whom the 1 st appellant is alleged to

have has an affair. The incident in question took place around 9.15pm at

the residence of the deceased ' Sampath Chaminda' was the sole eye

witness to the incident in question, who is a cousin of the 2nd appellant.

Modem Criminologists agree that a large maj ority of homicides occur

among persons who stand in a close emotional relationship to each other.

The studies of MC Clintock on " Crimes of Violence" (London 1963)

page 217 and Gibson and Klein on "Murder" (Home Office Research Unit

Report, 1961) substantiate the proposition that it is universally true that the

larger proportion of Homicides occur as a result of persons resorting of

homicide as an ultimate release from the strain imposed by the emotional

relationship they had formed with their victims. Such Homicides present a

contrast to homicides which result from motives of gain or lust, as the victims

in such case are innocent strangers who would in no way have contributed to

their own demise. The latter types of Homicides are more reprehensible and

evoke greater feelings of insecurity. The former types of Homicides are

"Victim precipitated" in that if not for the participation in the interaction by

the victim and his contribution to the exacerbation of the relationship between

him and the offender, the Homicide may not have occurred. Indeed, there is

room for belief that the victim may himself have chosen Homicide of the

offender as release from the strain which he too suffers as a result of the

relationship if the offender had not moved first. (See H Von Henting, The

Criminal and his victim, New Haven, 1948 page 383 and M. E Wolfgang,

"Victim Precipitated Homicide" 48, Journal of Criminal law, Criminology

and Police science 1.1957.)

With all that in my mind let me now tum to the facts and

circumstances of this case to consider whether there was any basis for the

learned trial judge to consider a plea of" Sudden Provocation or Cumulative

provocation" .

According to the testimony of " Sampath Chaminda" he and the

deceased have purchased goods from the boutique and proceeded to go to

the house of the deceased. On the way, the witness has left his motor cycle

and the goods he purchased at the house of " Dayalatha" to be collected

later. Thereafter, they have proceeded on foot.

When they reached the house of the deceased, the witness has

remained outside. The deceased has opened the door and gone inside. At

that time the deceased has found two appellants, his legal wife and her

paramour in a compromising position. When the deceased confronted the

second appellant as to what he was doing, the second appellant has pulled

out a knife and stabbed him.

The first appellant made a dock statement and she stated,

1. The deceased came home that day drunk, with a head injury.

2. That she was assaulted by him, therefore, she went to her mother's house

with the child

3. That when she came back, she saw the deceased lying on the ground with

a bleeding injury.

4. That she went to the police with her mother and she handed over the axe

as the police asked for it.

The second appellant gave evidence on oath. He denied any involvement

with the commission of the offence and denied the alleged affair with the

first appellant.

" Kanthi' is the mother of the first appellant who made the first

complaint in this case. It was her evidence that;

1. The deceased after the influence of liquor had been having

frequent quarrels with the first appellant for about four or five

years.

2. In the night on the date in question, around 10.00 to 10.30 p.m.,

she has heard her daughter raising cries to the effect that her

husband was assaulting her and when she had stepped to the

compound the deceased had chased after her with a crow bar at

which point the witness had run to escape from the clutches of the

deceased and she has fallen.

3. She had carried the younger child of her daughter who was living

with her and escaped.

4. She further testified that subsequently her daughter, the first

appellant had come to her house and made a confession to the

effect that she has attacked the deceased.

ft

As per the testimony of prosecution witness " Sam path Chaminda"

when the deceased returned home, the deceased found his wife, the first

appellant committing adultery with her paramour, the second appellant.

The sight of adultery of the deceased's wife, the first appellant is the

highest form of provocation that the deceased could have ( see; R V Maddy

1672 (1) Ventiries 158 DPP v Holmes 1964 AC 588). The learned trial

judge has properly considered the mental picture of the adultery revived in

the deceased by the sight of his wife, the first appellant having sex with her

paramour, the second appellant. Therefore, the deceased's confrontation

with the second appellant as to what he was doing is not provocation to

consider a lesser culpability. There is absolutely no evidence to establish

that the deceased provoked either of the appellants at any stage.

The first appellant made a dock statement and she stated, that the

deceased came home that day drunk, with a head injury. That she was

assaulted by him, therefore, she went to her mother's house with the child.

That when she came back, she saw the deceased lying on the ground with a

I

,

bleeding injury. That she went to the police with her mother and she handed

over the axe as the police asked for it.

"Kanthi" is the mother of the first appellant who made the first

complaint in this case. It was her evidence that; the deceased after the

influence of liquor had been having frequent quarrels with the first appellant

for about four or five years. In the night on the date in question, around

10.00 to 10.30 p.m., she had heard her daughter raising cries to the effect

that her husband was assaulting her and when she had stepped to the

compound the deceased had chased after her with a crow bar at which point

the witness had run to escape from the clutches of the deceased and she had

fallen. She had carried the younger child of her daughter who was living

with her and escaped.

She further testified that subsequently her daughter, the first appellant had

come to her house and made a confession to the effect that she has attacked

the deceased. The Judicial Medical Officer has observed 17 cut injuries and

two stab injuries on the dead body. Therefore, the retaliation is so brutal as to

show that it proceeded from a murderous intention. Therefore, the plea of

8

cumulative provocation would not be successful. The basis is that the extreme

brutality of the retaliation act leads to the inference of precedent malice. (

See; R V Holloway, 1628, Cro Car 131, All ER 1979 at page 131.)

Moreover, the dead body was found 12 meter away from the house of the

deceased in a shrub jungle. This is clearly shows that the homicidal act is

though upon and brooded over.

There is absolutely no basis for the learned trial Judge to consider the plea of

"Grave provocation" or "cumulative Provocation". We see no reasons to

interfere with the finding of the learned Trial Judge. Conviction and death

sentence affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.
