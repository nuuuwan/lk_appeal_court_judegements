Heard learned President's Counsel in support of this application

and learned President's Counsel representing the Respondents.

The three petitioners who were employees of the 1st Respondent

bank had come before this Court challenging a decision by the 1st

Respondent bank to suspend their services pending disciplinary

inquiry under the disciplinary code of the 1st Respondent bank.

As revealed before this court, the three petitioners were

attached to the Bandarawela Branch of the 1st Petitioner bank

working in the pawning section. In the year 2014, the services

of the said three petitioners were suspended pending

disciplinary inquiry. Subsequent to the said disciplinary

inquiry they were reinstated without back wages and transferred

out from the said branch. As revealed before this Court, at the

said inquiry, other than several other allegations against them,

there were specific allegations with regard to 652 items of Gold

Jewelleries which were pawned to the bank. When the three

petitioners were reinstated the bank had reinstated them subject

to certain punishments and with a warning that they should not

be found guilty for any other matter of misconduct in future.

As observed by this court, the present investigation which is

evident from P2 refers to pawning of Gold Jewellery to which the

three petitioners were responsible for the years 2011, 2012 and

2013 which were not subject matter to the previous

investigation. However, learned president's Counsel for the

petitioner takes up the position that the Gold items which were

in the custody of the petitioners were properly handed over to

the Respondent bank in presence of three auditors and several

other officials from the Respondent Bank.

However, by going through the documentations before this Court,

we observe that a physical verification was done with regard to

the said Gold Jewelry, but we cannot agree with the petitioners

that the said inspection was final and conclusive since the

carrotage of the Gold jewelry cannot be ascertained by a

physical verification,. The position of the petitioners before

this Court is that the 1st Respondent bank acting in Mala Fide

are now trying to fix them to certain charges illegally with the

intention of punishing them for the 2nd time since they were

previously punished by the document P8C-P8E.

However, we observe that the investigation presently carried out

by the 1st Respondent have nothing to do with the investigation

they have previously conducted. Therefore, we cannot agree with

the said submissions of the learned President's Counsel for the

petitioner. The learned President's Counsel further brings to

the notice of Court that the Respondent bank have failed to

honour the undertaking given in the document P8F where they

wanted the petitioners to be present when the pawned items were

auctioned. But, we observe that the said undertaking is only

valid to the Gold jewellery which were referred to in documents

P8C-P8F but not to the other jewellery which are the subj ect

matter to the present investigation.

Considering the matter placed before us, it is our considered

view that the 1st Respondent, the employer of the three

petitioners are entitled to investigate into offences or acts of

misconduct committed by their employers at any time when the

said acts of misconduct or offences were revealed to the

Management. In these circumstances, we see no merit in this

application before us.

Application is accordingly dismissed.
