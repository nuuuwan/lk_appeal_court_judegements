Order

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

Heard Counsel in support of the Petition.

2

The Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Petitioner is not proceeding

against the 1 st and 2nd Respondents.

The Petitioner is seeking a mandate in the nature of Writ of Mandamus

directing 1 st to 4th Respondents to issue a permit, to the Petitioner pertaining to Lot

265 in Plan No. STPP 341L.

3

The 2nd paragraph to the Petition, as disclosed are facts contained in letter

dated 11.08.2005, by the Provincial Secretary Kilinochchi, marked PI. However

Document PI attached to the Petition is a letter written by the Divisional Secretary

I Assistant District Secretary of Kilinochchi and therefore does not support the

averments contained therein. It is also observed that the translation of document

marked P2 ("the letter dated 02112/2010, 33 residents in the area certifying that the

Petitioner and three others are residing in that block of land") is not consistent

with the document produced in Tamil and does not support the facts as pleaded in

paragraph 4 to the Petition. Further the Petitioner has failed to submit any

documentl plan to identify the land described lot 265 in Plan No. STPP 34/L as

claimed by the Petitioner, in paragraph 6 to the Petition.

Therefore we are of the view that the Petitioner has failed to disclose vital

facts and documents in order to obtain the reliefs prayed for.

Notice refused.

Petition dismissed without costs.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree.
