When this case was originally came up before this Court on

Throughout she was absent. On 30.11.2015 the Counsel and the

appellant were absent and the Court issued notice on the appellant.

Thereafter, notices were issued on the more than five occasions but neither

the appellant nor her Counsel were present in Court. Hence, the Court

decided to take up this matter for argument.

Learned Counsel for the respondents the Deputy Solicitor

General Mrs. Varunica Hettige took up a preliminary objection stating that

this Court has no jurisdiction because the original matter was in the

Magistrate's Court. From there it was appealed to the High Court and the

appellant has preferred an appeal to this Court against the High Court

order.
