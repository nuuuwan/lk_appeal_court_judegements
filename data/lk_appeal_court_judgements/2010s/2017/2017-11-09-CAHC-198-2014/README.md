Counsel for the Appellant informs Court that they

are only contesting the sentence and not the conviction and moves

that the sentence be back dated to the date of imposing of the

sentence. State Counsel informs Court that he has no objection to this

application.

Appellant was sentenced to 6 months R.I. under

section 297 and 315 read with Section 32 of the Penal Code. After

trial the accused was convicted and sentenced to 15 years R.I. and a

fine of Rs. 50001= was ordered with a default term of 3 months

for the 1 st charge and for the 2nd charge he was convicted and

sentenced to one year R.1. and a fine of Rs. 1000/= was ordered with

a default term of 3 months. Considering the application of the

appellant and the evidence, since the appellant has been convicted and

sentenced under Section 297 of the Penal Code, we decide to back date

the sentence of the accused-appellant. The sentence should operate from

the date of conviction that is 10.11.2014. Subject to the above

variation the judgment dated 10.11.2014 is affirmed. Appeal IS

dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL L.U. Jayasuriya, J.

I agree.
