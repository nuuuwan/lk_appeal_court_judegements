A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

This is an application for the Issue of writs in the nature of Certiorari,

Mandamus and Prohibition.

By application dated 1 st September 2015, the Petitioner has sought for a

mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash decisions reflected in PI 7,

P21 and P22 made by the 4th Respondent (Assistant Commissioner of Labour

Ratnapura) and also to quash the proceedings in the inquiry bearing No.

TRl07/03/94/2012-A and No. TRl07/03/388/2012-D held before the 5th

Respondent (District Labour Officer Ratnapura). The Petitioner has also sought

and order in the nature of a writ of Mandamus to direct the 1st to 4th Respondents

to hold a fresh inquiry regarding complaints made by the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th

Respondents, and also for an order in the nature of a writ of Prohibition to stop

further proceedings in Case No. 32060 Magistrate's Court of Ratnapura.

The Petitioner submits that he became aware that the 6t\ 7th, 8th and 9th

Respondents had complained to the 4th Respondent, that as employees of the

Petitioner they were deprived of payments due in terms of the Employees'

Provident Fund Act (EPF). The Petitioner has admitted the employment of the 6th

3

Respondent for a period of 6 months from l5t January 1998. However has denied

the employment of the ih, 8th and 9th Respondents at any time.

Due to the aforesaid complaints, the Petitioner was summoned by the 5th

Respondent for an inquiry by notice bearing No. TRl07/03/3 88120 12, dated 1 st

January 2013, in respect of a complaint made by the i h Respondent and by notice

bearing No.TRl07/03/94/2012, dated 19th February 2013, on complaints by the 6t\

8th and 9th Respondents. The chronology of events pertaining to the said inquiries

are set out in the Petition.

The Petitioner states that at the aforesaid mqumes he was deprived of

submitting records to establish that the i h to 9th Respondents were never

employed by the Petitioner. However the 5th Respondent considered such evidence

to be irrelevant. The Petitioner further submits that at the conclusion of the said

inquiry the 5th Respondent informed the Petitioner orally that the statements given

by the 6th to 9th Respondents were sufficient to establish that the said Respondents

were employed by the Petitioner. The Petitioner has not received any written order

to this effect.

Being aggrieved by the said order the Petitioner by letter dated 28th

December 2013, to the 3 rd Respondent (Deputy Commissioner of Labour)

complained of irregularities of the said inquiry and had sought for a fresh inquiry

to be held regarding the complaints preferred by the 6th to 9th Respondents.

Accordingly the 3rd Respondent had directed the 4th Respondent (Assistant

I! ! !

4

Commissioner of Labour Ratnapura) to inquire into the matter and to submit a

report to the 3rd Respondent. The Petitioner had not heard of any further action

been taken by either of the Respondents regarding the said letter.

Thereafter, the Petitioner received notice dated 13th August 2014, from the

4th Respondent which is marked P 17. After receiving the said notice the Petitioner

by letter dated 3rd September 2014, complained to the 15t Respondent

(Commissioner General of Labour) requesting for a fresh inquiry on the basis of

irregularities of the previous inquiry to determine default EPF contributions if any,

payable to the 6th to 9th Respondents. However the Petitioner received summons

from the Magistrate's Court of Ratnapura in Case No. 32060 where the 4th

Respondent had filed a certificate dated 30.01.2015 under Section 38(2) of the

EPF Act.

On a direction given by this Court, by motion dated 24th January 2017, the

entire record of the inquiry was tendered to Court by the 5th Respondent. The

reasons given for the decision made by the 5th Respondent in proceedings dated 4th

April 2014, states that,

The Petitioner further states that the 5th Respondent failed to gIve the

Petitioner and opportunity to submit documents which he relied upon to establish

his case but proceeded to make order on the statements given by the 6th to 9th

Respondents and also failed to give adequate reasons for his decision.

The Petitioner states that the documents which the Petitioner sought to

present before the inquiry has been in the possession of the Petitioner. In terms of

the EPF Act, the Commissioner of Labour is not only to determine claims, but he

is also empowered to call for any record or documents for examination. As such it

is incumbent upon the Inquiring Officer to have permitted the Petitioner to submit

supporting documents which were in the possession of the Petitioner.

The Petitioner denies employing the i h to 9th Respondents and states that

the said Respondents were never employed by the Petitioner and further states that

the 6th Respondent is not entitled to EPF payments. Proceedings dated 4th June

2014, makes it clear that the calculation of payment of arrears were done based on

the statements given by the 6th to 9th Respondents.

It is observed that the 3rd Respondent by letters marked P 15 and P23 has

directed the 4th Respondent to re-visit the decision made by the 5th Respondent and

to submit a report. Before the said determination by the 3rd Respondent the

Petitioner by letter dated 28th December 2013, has also requested for a fresh

inquiry stating irregularities in the conduct of the inquiry. However the 4th

I ! 6

Respondent has proceeded with the decision of the mqUlry and has instituted

action against the Petitioner in the Magistrate's Court.

The 5th Respondent's decision made on the 4th April 2014 is that there has

been previous complaints against the Petitioner by past employees with regard to

payment of EPF and therefore it is probable that the 6th to 9th Respondents were

also employees of the Petitioner.

As held in Sportsman Tea (Pvt) Ltd. vs. Commissioner General of Labour

and others (2006) 1 SLR 93, the 5th Respondent is not under a statutory obligation

to give reasons for the said decision. However since the 5th Respondent has given

his reasons for his decision, the Court can review such decision and grant relief to

the Petitioner if needed. In his decision the 5th Respondent refers to a probability

that the 6th to 9th Respondents were employees of the Petitioner. The said reference

is based on facts remotely connected to the existence of previous non compliance

of a statutory duty by the Petitioner. A determination based on probability

regarding facts in issue is illogical and therefore, would not attract the protection

of the law.

On an examination of the reasons given by the 5th Respondent, we are of

the view that the said determination is based on irrelevant considerations thus

depriving the Petitioner of his legitimate right to have a lawful inquiry.

7

In the circumstances of this application we are of the VIew that the

Petitioner is entitled to the reliefs sought in his prayer to the Petition. As such we

grant a writ of Certiorari quashing the decisions referred to in sub paragraph (d),

(e), (t), (g) and (h) and a writ of Mandamus directing the Commissioner of Labour

to hold a fresh inquiry referred to in sub paragraph (i) and grant a writ of

Prohibition referred to in sub paragraph U) of the prayer to the Petition.

I make no order as to costs.

Application allowed.
