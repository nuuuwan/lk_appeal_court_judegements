The Petitioner filed the petition on I sl April. 20 I 4. subsequently after being served a Notice for interim relief. Following other processes. formal Notices were marked by the Respondents on 22nd May. 20 I 4 and after obtaining several dates Respondents filed their Counter Objections on 10th April. 2015. The Petitioners obtained several dates to file Counter Objections on 15th February. 20 15 and in the meantime. the matter was tixed for argument on 02nd February. 2016.

However. on 28th February. 20 I 6. the Intervening Applicant filed an application to intervene in this matter. When the matter was taken up for determination on 2nd

February. 2016 the Petitioner raised an objection for the intervention but the DSG who is appearing for the Respondents informed the Court that he has no objection for the aforementioned application for intervention. The Counsel for the Intervenient Applicant as the Petitioner moved Court to make a relevant decision based on the strength of the application and the written submission.

The Intervenient Applicant states that. (Quoted from the written submissions of the Intervenient - Petitioner)

Para [3} " ... it a company incorporated in India and is a fully owned subsidiary of Medtronic Inc. US.A(hereinafler "Medtronic Inc 'j, which is the sole ma11l{(acturer of all "Medtronic" range of medical equipment and devices' distributed and sold all over the world. "

Para [51 "The termination of the registration (~( licence to import the said Device hy the Petitioner - Respondcnt which is challcnged h.l' the Petitiof/er . Respondent in these proceedings are devices I1WI1l(!(lctured and supplied hy Medtronic Inc. for the importation of which the Intervenient - Petition had appointed the Petitioner - Respondent as the agent in Sri Lanka. "

Para [6) "The Intervenient - Petitioner terminated the Agency Agreement in respect of the said Device with the Petitioner - Respondent on or about Ii" FebruGlT 2012."

Para [8} "Notwithstanding the same, the Petitioner -Respondent had il/egal/.v distributed and stored the said Device without a certificate of registration or a License to import the said product in blatant violation a/the (ipplicable laws and rei!u/ation. The Petitioner -Respondent is currently prosecuted by the Cosmetics. Devices and Drugs Authority in the Magistrates

Court of Maligakanda under Case NO.8230812012 in connection with the said

offence. "

Para [14] "The Petitioner -Respondent has thus lI'i((itl~\' left out the Intervenient - Petitioner in order to misinterpret material facts to Your Lordships' COllrt and is allempting to mislead Your Lordship's Court by sllbmillingfabricated material purportedly in support of its case. "

Para [19] "The Intervenient - Petitioner submits that the Petitioner Respondents has deliberate~l' refrained .from making the Intervenient , Petitioner and lor Medtronic Inc. a party to this action, knowing full well that the Intervenient - Petitioner was a party having su.fficient interest to the issue

b(~(i)re COllrt in an allempt to deprive Your Lordships' Court of being ful~v appraised of the facts surrollnding the dispute at hand. "

The Petitioner vehemently objecting the application of intervention by the Intervenient Applicant and states as following (Quoted from the written submissions of the Petitioner):

Para [5] "It is sllbmilled that thele is no provision in law which permits the intervention of a party to an application for the issuance of prerogative Writs before YOllr Lordships' Court"

Para [6]" It is submitted that this position is extremely clear in that the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 drafted under and in terms of . Article 138 of the constitution which deal with the procedure of Court for the dealing with applications including, inter alia. prerogative Writs. do not provide for the intervention of third parties. "

Para [f8] "The necessalT parties for this purpose are the Petitioner and the

t' Respondent and no other. "

Para [28] "The Petitioner .(iltther plead,' that in any (,\'Cl1t that the parties seeking to intervene are not aggrieved parties. "

Para [40] It is submitted that ex facie the papers filed it is evident that the said parties are seeking intervention for mala fidesl extraneous reasons in that, the said parties in the said Petition have pleaded. inter alia. that: (1) thev had certain contracts with the Petitioner (2) the said contracts have been breached by the Petitioner (3) thus, they have sl{(fered extensive financial loss as a result

Basic legal provIsIOn for Issuance of Writ IS governed by Article 138 of the Constitution

(I) The Court (?f Appeal shall have alld exercise sll/~iect 10 Ihe provisions of the Constitlltion or l?f any lOll'. an appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in lall' 11'hich shall he [commilled hy Ihe High Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any Court of First Instance), tribunal or other institlltion and sale and exclusive cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum. of all causes. suits. actions, prosecutions, matters and things [of which such High Court. Court of First Instance} tribunal or other institution may have taken cognizance : Provided that no judgement. decree or order of any court shall be reversed or. varied on accollnt of any error. defect or irregularity, 11/hich has 110t prejudiced the substantial rights l?ftlle parties or occasioned afai/ure ofjustice. (2) Tile COllrtl?fAppeal shall also have and exercise all such powers andjurisdiction, appellate and original. as Parliament may by law vest or ordain.

CA (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 provides for the procedure to be adopted by Court when dealing with an application iricluding inter alia prerogative Writs, and does not expressly provide for the intervention by third parties and disallows such.

However. time and time again. Court had allowed intervention and thus. there are judgments in favour of and against such interventions. When analysing the previous discussions. there exists a liheral and a strict approach adopted by the judges.

In Government School Dental Therapist Association V Director General of Health Services and Others (CA Writ Application No. 861/93) wherein Court allowed the intervention sought on the following basis:

"Each l?f the Intervenient Petitioners in the present case cannot be said to be a diflerent "meddlesome busybody" or a "meddlesome interloper' who do not have a sl!fJicient interest in the pending application. I would therefore adopt the liberalized rules in reKard to the standinK (?(a party entitled to seck a rcmc((\'. to the C(lSC o('an illlervellielll 11'ho silllilar~r has a sujjiciellt illterest ill the subject mailer oia pending writ application. alld on that basis to permit the intervention, "

In Jayawardena V. Ministry of Health and Others (CA Writ Application No. 978/2008, decided on 21.05.09) where the courts allowed the intervention sought on the following basis:

"What the cOllrt at this point l?f time needs to consider is whether the intervenient part)' is a necessG1T party and having such party in the case would in all circumstances assist cOllrt ill considering the merit and demerits of the application before court"

In Indrani Dewalage Ranasinghe and Others Vs. Commissioner General of (CA Writ Application No. 127/10 decided on 11.05.2011) where the court allowed Ceylon tobacco company and two other partiers who sought to intervene in an application chalknging the tax. imposed on white beedi to intervene into the said proceedings. In allowing the intervention. court observed that;

"There is spec(fic rule (~r laB' in the court (if appeal rules In Sri Lanka which governs the issue ~r il1ter\'(:l1tion applicatiol1s by third parties in Writ applications. However, Ollr courts have considered the issues of szifjicient cause and interest of affected parties ill exercisil1g the inherel1t and discretionary power of the court to allow the

i11fervention applications. "

But in Weerakoon and Another V. Banadaragama Pradeshiya Sabhawa (CA Writ Application No. 58612007 decided on 2011.11.22) 2012 BLR 310 the Divisional Bench upheld the decision of M.D Chandrasena and Two Others V S.F. De Silva 63 N.L.R at page 143 ...... that in an application f(JI' a writ in the nature of Mandamus or 'Certiorari persons other than those who are parties to the application are not entitled to take part in the proceedings as Intervenient. It lvas jitrther held in that case that the English common laB' has been adopted by our courts to determine the principles that should guide the cOllrt in either granting or refusing these Writs but it had never been the practice ~r this cOllrt to alloH' persons other than those who are parties to the application for Writs to intervene in the proceedings. Their lordships' further held in that the English rilles made by the courts in England permitting the court to allow an Intervenient to take part in proceedings initiated by way of a writ of Mandamus clearly have no application in Sri Lanka and that although the courts ordinance empowered the Supreme cOllrt to make rules governing its own procedure, no rules have yet been fj'amed to enabling an Intervenient to take part in proceedings for the issue of Writs of Mandamus or Certiorari to which he is not a party. "

Further. the divisional bench considered in the case of Harold Peter Fernando Vs the Divisional Secretary Hanguranketha and Two Others reported in 2005 B.L.R at pae:e 120 Saleem Marsoof.J Cltll1g with approval the judgment of Dr.H.W.Thambiah.J in M.D Chandrasena and Two Others V S.F. De Silva(supra) held inter alia that

1. The court ~r appeal rules. 1990 made under article 136 of the constitution of the democratic socialist republic of Sri Lanka setting out the procedure to be followed this cOllrt in dealing with applications inter alia for prerogative Writs, do not provide for third-party interventions in proceedings, II. There is 110 corresponding provision in the constitution or any other law seeking to confer 01' a third party of audience in the court of appeal in th~ lines

~f article 134(3) of the constitution. as it illustrates the restraint that is exercised by the apex cOllrt of the country in dealing with applications for third party intervention in the context ~r the supervisory jurisdiction of court which

is exercised with the view to keeping administrative authorities within their lmt:ful bounds.

It appears that the relationship between the Petitioner and the Intervening Applicant is based upon a contract and it will not come within the ambit of jurisdiction of Writs and parties may advice themselves the appropriate cause of action to be followed. Furthermore. the Intervening Applicant has the capacity to make appropriate representations to the Hon. Attorney General. who is the Chief Legal Officer and holds Quasi-Judicial office.

When considering the law. it is clear now that there is no express provision to allow the intervention in Writ matters as per the rules of Court of Appeal. Therefore, the view of the Court is to strictly follow the order of the divisional bench in Weerakoon and Another V. Ban#daragama Pradeshiya Sabhawa (CA Writ Application No. 586/2007 decided on 2011.11.22).

In conclusion. after careful consideration of all the available facts. law and the decided authorities. the Court is of the view that. intervention will not be permitted accordingly.

Application for intervention is disallowed.
