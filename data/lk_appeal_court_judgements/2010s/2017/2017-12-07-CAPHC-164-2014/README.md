Judgment

K. K. Wickremasinghe

The Petitioner Appellant (herein after referred to as the Appellant) in this case has

preferred this appeal to this court after being aggrieved by the order dated

27.08.2014 by the Learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya and the order dated

21.06.2012 of the Learned Magistrate Court of Kuliyapitiya.

Facts of the case:

The vehicle in question was taken in to custody for transporting illicit timber by

the lorry bearing No.42-2516. The accused was charged on 15.12.2011 the

accused pleaded guilty and he was fined with a sum of Rs.50,OOO/- and the case

was re-fixed for claiming inquiry of vehicle . The learned Magistrate held an

inquiry and confiscated the vehicle on the basis that neither th~ finance company,

nor the Appellant had taken satisfactory precautions to prevent an offence being

committed. The Appellant made a revision application to the High Court of

Ku/iyapitiya who affirmed the order given by the Learned Magistrate of

KUliyapitiya.

It is submitted by the Learned State Counsel that at the inquiry held by the

Magistrate the evidence given by the Appellant (registered owner) was steaming

with contradictions.

At the inquiry the position of the registered owner was that the driver was a

neighbour and like a son to her. In another occasion (page 72) she has referred to

3

1!

the driver as her driver. However in cross examination the Appellant admits that

the driver was in fact her own son. This contradictory evidence raises the issue of

her knowledge of the accused committing the said offence.

It was submitted by the Respondent that the burden cast on the Appellant is to

prove that her case on a balance of probability on the following:

1 the registered owner had no knowledge of the offence being committed.

2 The registered owner took all precaution to prevent the offence from taking

place.

In the case of Manawadu Vs Attorney-General ((1987) 2 SLR 30) Sharvananda, CJ,

held that;

II By section 7 of Act No.13 of 1982 it was not intended to deprive an owner if his

vehicle used by the offender in committing a 'forest offence' without his (owner's)

knowledge and without his participation. The word 'forfeited' must be given the meaning 'liable to be forfeited' so s to avoid the injustice that would flow on the construction that forfeiture of the vehicle is automatic on the conviction of the

accused. The amended sub-section 0 does not exclude by necessary implication the rule of 'audi ulteram partem'. The owner of the lorry not a party to the case is

entitled to be heard on the question of forfeiture of the lorry, if he satisfies the court that the accused committed the offence without his knowledge or

participation.

The Magistrate must hear the owner of the lorry on the question of showing why the lorry is not liable to be forfeited. If the Magistrate is satisfied with the cause

shown, he must restore the lorry to the owner. II

,In the same case of Mudankotuwa Vs Attorney General ((1996) 2 SLR77) the

Court of Appeal referred to the case of Manawadu Vs AttorneyGeneral(supra}

with approval and had stated that the owner of the vehicle, who is not a party to

the case, is entitled to be heard on the question of forfeiture of the vehicle and if

4

he satisfies the court the accused committed the offence without his knowledge

of participation, then his vehicle will not be liable to forfeiture.

In the case-of Nazir Vs I.P Wattegama (1978-79) 2 SLR 304) Vythyaligam,J.

considered the implications of the proviso to sec.3A of the Animals Act, N029 of

1958 as amended. Section 3A of the Act states as follows;

"Where a person is convicted of an offence under this part or any regulations made thee under, any vehicle used in the commission of the offence shall, in addition to any other punishment prescribed for such offence, be liable, by order of the convicting Magistrate to confiscation:

Provided however, that in any case where the owner if the vehicle is a third party, no order of confiscation shall be made, if the owner proves to the satisfaction of the court that he had taken all precautions to prevent the use of vehicle or that the vehicle has been used without his knowledge for the commission of the offence."

In the case of Fariz Vs Ole, Police Station, Galenbindunuwewa ((1992) 1 SLR 167)

It was stated that in terms of proviso to sec.3A of the Animals Act, an order for

confiscation cannot be made if the owner establishes one of the following;

"That he has taken all precautions to prevent the use for the vehicle for the commission of the offence.

That the vehicle had been used for the commission of the offence without his knowledge. "

The Counsel for the Respondent took up the position that the burden of proof

casted on the Appellant is to prove that on a balance of probability, the registered

owner, took all precautions to prevent the offence fromtaking place.

5

In the case of Mary Matilda Vs OIC Habarana CA (PHC) 86/87 it was held that;

" the owner of the vehicle to discharge the burden (1) that he/she had taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for commission of the offence (2) that the vehicle had been used for the commission of the offence without his/her know/edge, mere giving instructions is not sufficient.. ..... She must establish that genuine instructions were in fact given and that she took every endeavor to implement the instructions."

The Respondent not only submitted that the Appellant has not proved on a

balance of probability that she has taken all the precaution to prevent the offence

from taking place but also that she had the knowledge of the offence being

committed.

Considering the above mentioned circumstances, there is no reason to set aside

the orders of the Learned Magistrate and the High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya in

respect of the confiscation of vehicle bearing No. 42-2516.

Therefore, the appeal is hereby dismissed without costs.
