The Plaintiff-Appellant brought this action against the Defendant-

Respondent seeking her ejectment from the premises morefully

described in the schedule to the plaint in the suit and damages

commencing from 01.01.1990 on the ground that what was a bare land

in which the Defendant-Respondent erected an unauthorized structure on

the agreement to remove and vacate the premises upon the plaintiff s

request. The plaintiff further pleaded that Defendant-Respondent paid

only a aground rent and the unauthorized structure has been given an

assessment 51/15 T by the Colombo Municipal Council and therefore,

the provisions of the Rent Act do not apply to the premises.

The Defendant-Respondent in her answer whilst denying the

averments in the plaint prayed for dismissal of the action. This case

proceeded to trial with 9 issues and at the conclusion of the case the

learned District Judge on 24.04.1988 delivered judgment dismissing the

plaint of the Plaintiff-Appellant with costs holding that the Defendant-

Respondent is the tenant of the premises in dispute and which is

governed by the Rent Act, and the present Appeal is against the afore

said judgment of the learned District Judge.

At the hearing of this appeal learned Counsel for the plaintiff-

appellant contended that the premises in the suit is not governed by the

Rent Act of 1972, and is an illegal and unauthorized structure erected by

the defendant-respondent without any approved plan from the Colombo

Municipal Council and by which the Defendant-Respondent is not

entitled to the protection of the Rent Act.

The learned counsel for the Defendant-Respondent contended

that the Defendant had several rent payments to the Colombo Municipal

Council which were all accepted and paid to the Plaintiff- Appellant and

that the premises which is an authorized are capable of being let and

which comes within the ambit of the Rent Act and thus the defendant is

entitled to protection of the Rent Act.

It was common ground that at the outset the plaintiff-appellant

had leased the bare land in suit to the Defendant-Respondent

commencing from 1964 on monthly rental of Rs.15/- and, subsequently

a sum of Rs.301-per mensum, it was also revealed that during the

tenancy the Defendant-Respondent has constructed the said premises,

which the Plaintiff-Appellant chose to refer to as an unauthorized

building thus the Plaintiff-Appellant sent a notice to the Defendant-

Respondent demanding the vacant possession thereof.

At the trial it was admitted by either parties that the portion of the

bare land which was let by the Plaintiff-Appellant to the Defendant-

Respondent after commencing the said lease the Defendant-Respondent

erected an unauthorized building on the land without approved plan or

certificate of conformity for it whereas the premises in question was

given an assessment No.51115T by the Colombo Municipal Council.

In Weerasena Vs. Perera 1991 (1) SLR121 the Court held that the

mere assessment and subdivision of a part of the premises does not give

rise to a separate letting or given birth to new premise.

The Counsel for the defendant-respondent relied and contented

that the receipts which describing as house rent issued to the plaintiff-

5

~ t I I I i i ! I I I ! I I I I ! I I I i

I I i ,

appellant by the Colombo Municipal Council constituting house rent and

thus the defendant-respondent is entitled to the protection of the Rent

Act. All these receipts were tendered in evidence at the trial before

learned District Judge and in common parlance they are considered as

common receipts and which are not specifically printed for the purpose

of rent for this premise and they are seemingly being used by the

Colombo Municipal Council for the common use of the rent.

These receipts would be especially useful to find out the "status of

the parties" in the tenancy alone, These receipts describing as house rent

shall not be accepted as conclusive evidence on the issue of house rent in

Jinasena Vs. The Commercial Investment and Financial Co. Ltd. 1985

(1) SLR at page 238.

It is also revealed that the issue of receipts was not clearly settled

on part of the defendant-respondent at the trial. However at the trial it

was admitted that the house erected is illegal and temporary nature in

Jayasing Vs. Seethawakapur Urban Council and other 2003 (3) SLR

at page 40 held that once an area has been declared as a development

activity in any such part without a permit issued by the Urban

Development Authority.

It is also revealed that the house built at the instance of the

defendant-respondent after the commencement of lease in respect of

bare land in contravention of the provisions of UDA. The law of

Property in Sri Lanka (Vol-2) written by G.L. Peiris - at page 88- 89

"Where the thing to be let has no actual existence at the time of the

formation of contract, to there is no doubt that it must have at least a

potential existence for example a house to be built this lease of which is

commence on the completion of the building"

I In DS Mathanayaka Vs. MDR Senaratne 75 NLR at page 349 I

"(III

held that, where lease of a bare land which provides for monthly

payment of ground rent contains a condition of the lease to put up with

approval of the lessor building and structure of a temporary nature

which lessee would entitled to remove at any time the provision of Rent

Restriction Act are not applicable to such contract of letting.

Dharmawardena Vs. Walwattage (1987) 1 SLR L.R. may be

cited thus "one of the essential requisites of a contract of letting and

hiring is that the thing should be capable of being let. A lease like any

other contract must be legal it must not be prohibited by statute. An

illegal lease is invalid on account of its content.

In the instant case there is an express statutory prohibition in the

housing and Town Improvement Ordinance against the occupation of a

building in respect to which no certificate of conformity has been

obtained. The premises in suit was such a building and the landlord

could not have delivered to the tenant the use and occupation of the

premises let as is required in a contract of letting and hiring. The

contract of tenancy is tainted with statutory illegality and is ineffective

to create rights" .

The Provisions of the Rent Act do not apply to a contract of

tenancy rendered illegal by statute. The applicability of the maxim in

pari delicto potior est conditio defendantis considered.

We are of the view that the learned District Judge erred in law

determining that the defendant-respondent is a tenant of the premises

and is entitled to the protection of the Rent Act. As stated afore in the

case of Dharmawardena Vs. Walwattage (1987) I SLR the tainted

contract of letting cannot give rise to legal obligations enforceable in

the suit.

Therefore we set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge

dated 24.04.1988, and make no order as to costs in this appeal. The

appeal allowed.
