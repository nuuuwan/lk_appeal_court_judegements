JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Respondent) had filed an information in the Primary Court of

Galle under section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44

of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Act)as a private information

complaining to the learned Primary Court Judge that the Respondent-

Petitioner -Appellants had attempted to disturb her peaceful possession of

the land relevant to the dispute in this case.

4

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this complaint, by his

order dated 2002-02-05, had concluded that the Complainant -

Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Complainant Respondent) is entitled to the possession of the land in

dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge of Galle, the Respondent-Petitioner - Appellants (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Appellants) had filed a revision application in

the Provincial High Court of Southern Province holden in Galle urging the

Provincial High Court to revise the order made by the learned Primary

Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court of Galle after hearing parties, by its judgment

dated 2004-05-18 had refused the said application for revision. It had

proceeded to dismiss the said application affirming the order of the learned

Primary Court Judge.

The Appellant has filed this appeal in this Court against the said order of

the Provincial High Court.

5

This Court observed that the Appellant was absent and unrepresented

when it called the case in the morning on 2017-06-22. Thus this Court kept

this case down to enable anyone interested to appear before this Court

even at a later stage. However when this court took this case up for

argument as the last case in the list, still there was no one to look after the

interests of the Appellant. As this case had been fixed for argument and no

application of any sort on behalf of the Appellant was made, this Court

took this case up and concluded the argument.

Learned counsel for the Respondent having made a brief submission

undertook to file written submission within three weeks from the date of

argument. He had thereafter filed written submissions.

It is to be noted that the learned Provincial High Court Judge had taken

into consideration the nature of the proceedings under the Primary Courts

Procedure Act which is directed towards preventing breach of peace. He

had also taken into conSideration, the provisional nature of such

adjudication pending final determination of the rights of parties in a civil

Court.

This Court is in agreement with the above observations of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge.

This fact taken together with the other material adduced before court

proves to the satisfaction of this Court that there is no merit in this appeal.

Thus, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with costs.

Application is dismissed with costs.
