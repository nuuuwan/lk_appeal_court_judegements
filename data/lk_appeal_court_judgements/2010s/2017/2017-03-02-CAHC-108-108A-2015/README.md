The Accused - Appellants were on an indictment

charging them with having committed murder by

causIng the death of one Abedeera Werawarne

Patabandige Sarathchadra, an offence punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code.

Filtering the unnecessary details, the facts which are

necessary to be adumbrated for the adjudication of

the instant appeal are as follows.

The trial at the court below had evaluated the

testimony

of three mrun

of the deceased,

The mere incident of assault by the 3rd Accused-

Appellant was witnessed by the daughter

deceased, whose testimony reveals thus;

of the

That the brother of this witness was playing cricket,

and the father the deceased was standing close by,

as the ball went near the deceased, when he bent

down to pick the ball and it was at that time the

3 rd Accused - Appellant popularly known as Atta Lokka

has dealt the fatal blow which struck on the

deceased's head. Further it was her verSlOn that after

the attack when she went to the place where the

deceased was fallen non of the accused were at the

scene. More so the deceased body was little away from

the place where he was attacked. It was the

contention of the counsel for the 1st and the 3rd

Accused - Appellants that the above witness In her

statement to the police had stated that she came to

know that the father was attacked when he bent

down to pick the ball. The said suggestion was

refuted by the witness. To cap it all it IS said that

it was the 3rd Accused - Appellant who dealt a blow

to the deceased's head with a club. But she was

confronted with her evidence at the magisterial inquiry

wherein she has stated that Atasiri the 1 st Accused -

Appellant attacked the deceased with the club, but it

was her categorical position

Appellant dealt the fatal blow.

that the 3rd Accused-

Further it was contended by the counsel for the

above Appellants that the post-mortem report which IS

marked as PI does not reveal any external Injury on

the head of the deceased. But nevertheless JMO has

explained the nature of the injuries sustained by the

deceased and had expressed the oplnlOn that the

Injury No. 1 was fatal and the said Injury had

been caused by a blunt weapon, further it was also

observed that there IS no injuries on the forehead.

It IS alleged by the counsel that the Learned High

Court Judge has failed to analysed the discrepancy

of the statement of the above witness made to the

police and the evidence In the Magistrate Courts

regarding the identity of the assailant. It IS noted

from the testimony of the above witness that non

other than the 3rd Accused - Appellant has attacked

the deceased. The mere fact that there IS a

discrepancy as to the assailant will not affect the

case for the prosecution. In the instant case the 1st

accused IS the father of the 3rd accused. More

importantly all the accused persons were known to

the deceased family. Therefore this court IS of the

VIew that her evidence does not lack testimonial

trustworthiness, and the said discrepancy will not

deny a fair trial to the 3rd Accused - Appellant.

In the above setting I am persuaded to accept her

evidence and see no incurable dent In the

prosecution case.

In so far as the complicity of the

persons IS concerned it IS abundantly

other accused

clear as per

simply could

of the Penal

Code. According to the evidence of the above witness

evidence of the above witness that they

not be convicted under section 296

the prosecution has not been able to prove

murderous intention of the other accused persons.

According to the above witness the other accused

persons had assaulted the deceased with the hands

and legs. Hence at best they could be charged only

for causing hurt.

Hence In the said back drop the homicidal intention

as described in the Section 294 of the Penal Code

can be attributed only to the 3rd Accused - Appellant.

As another ground of appeal the it IS contended by

the appellants that the above witness would have not

seen the alleged attack. But it was her position that

the body was taken away from the place of the

incident to a place where the deceased met his doom.

Further it IS common ground that there had been a

dispute between these two families. The witness No. 2

son of the deceased who was 14 years of age has

testified to the fact that the 1st Accused - Appellant

son the 3rd Accused- Appellant dealt the fatal blow.

Thereafter the 1st 2nd, 4th 5th Accused - Appellants has

assaulted the deceased with the hands and the legs.

It 1S apparent that the 6 th Accused - Appellant was

indicted and convicted for the abusive words indicating

to kill the deceased.

It is to be noted that all the accused persons were

indicted for being members of an unlawful assembly

1n the prosecution of common object of which to

commit murder of the deceased and thereby committing

an offence under section 146 of the Penal Code. But

it is so apparent that the prosecution was not in a

position to establish the above element to punish

these accused.

This Court has adverted to a judgement handed out

by the Supreme Court of India 1n the case of

GANGA RAM SHA AND OTHERS .VS. STATE OF

BIHAR-DECIDED ON 27.01.2017 which observed thus;

"It 1S trite law that the common object of the

unlawful assembly has to be inferred from the

membership, the wepons used and the nature of the

1nJunes as well as other surrounding circumstances.

Intention of the members of the unlawful assembly

can be gathered by nature, number and location of

1nJunes inflicted".(emphasis added)

Hence 1n the ligh t of the above exposition of the

law and facts it is abundantly clear that the instant

case the Accused - Appellants presence has not

constituted an unlawful assembly to cause the death

of the deceased.

Thus In the above factual and legal matrix this

court IS compelled to set aside the conviction for

murder In respect of the 1st 2nd 4th 5th and 6th

accused-appellants and enter instead an order of

acquittal and thereby allow the appeal, but

nevertheless will dismiss the appeal of the 3rd

Accused - Appellant.

Accordingly appeal of the 3rd Accused-Appellant IS

dismissed, and appeals of the

Accused -Appellants are allowed.
