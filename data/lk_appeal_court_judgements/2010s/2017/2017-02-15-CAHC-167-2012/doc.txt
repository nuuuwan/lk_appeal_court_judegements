The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court for the murder

of one P.K. Nimalawathi under Sec. 296 read with Sec. 32 of the Penal

Code and also for causing injury to one A.G. Dingiri Appuhamy under Sec.

315 read with Sec. 32 of the Penal Code, and convicted and sentenced for

murder and death sentence was given for the first charge and 6 moth RI

for the second charge.

The story of the prosecution was that the accused appellant had

come to the deceased's house around eight in the night asking for a match

stick, and demanded money from the injured person. Subsequently the

deceased and the injured were stabed by the accused appellant after

forcing himself inside the house.

The only eye witness Niluka Senani has testified before the High

Court and narrated the whole incident in detail. The learned counsel for

the appellant argued that the identity of the accused appellant had not

been established beyond reasonable doubt. He further argued that there

was not enough light inside the house to identify the appellant. His

argument was the entire house had only two bottle lamps which were not

sufficient to identify the accused appellant. He referred to a contradiction

in page 100 of the brief where the witness has admitted in the Magistrates

Court that the bottle lamp was blown off before the appellant stabed the

deceased and the injured as well. Before dealing with this contradiction we

will have to refer to the admission recorded before the learned High Court

Judge.

The identification parade was held on 30/10/2000 and the

proceedings were marked as P3 in the High Court. We find that the

defence had admitted the parade notes in the High Court under Sec. 420

of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act. Therefore the learned High Court

Judge shouldn't have allowed the defence to dispute the admitted facts.

On this basis we disregard the contradictions with regard to the identity

marked at the trial. It appears from the evidence of the sole eye witness

that the deceased was holding a bottle lamp when they were attacked.

The counsel for the appellant further argued citing the judgment in

Wijepala vs AG that when there is only one eye witness the evidence has

to be established as wholly reliable. On a careful perusal of the sole eye

witness's evidence we find that her evidence pass the tests of spontaneity

and probability.

The counsel for the accused appellant referred to page 98 of the

brief and said that the deceased had uttered the word "Appu Putha" which

he argued shows that the assailant was a third party. Even if the deceased

has uttered the words "Appu Putha" the sole eye witness has identified the

accused appellant and she has specifically stated she could identify the

person who attacked the deceased and the injured. Moreover she has

categorically stated in her evidence only one person forcibly entered the

house demanding for money she also referred to a person who stayed

outside who's hand she had seen.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General submitted that the eye witness

was 22 years of age at the time she testified before the High Court, and

that her evidence was corroborated by the police officer's evidence. He

also stated that the witness had ample time to identify the accused

appellant from the time he entered the house and that the incident had

taken place in close proximity to where she stood.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General referred to page 69 of the brief

and said the eye witness had stated that there was a light burning in the

neighbor's house which fell on to their kitchen. This light has been

observed by the investigating officer, this was not disputed in the High

Court. Citing the judgment in Thillipu Mandige Nalaka Chrishantha

Kumara Thisera vs AG C.A. Appeal 87/2005 decided on 17/05/07

stated that it was decided when the evidence has not been challenged by

the defence such evidence is considered as proved.

The Deputy Solicitor General further submitted that the investigating

officer has found two pairs of slippers outside which did not belong to the

inmates of the house, which prompted them to frame charges under Sec.

32 of the Penal Code.

The main argument of the counsel for the appellant was that this is

a case of mistaken identity. We do not agree with this argument since the

eye witness has specifically stated she witnessed the entire incident at

close proximity and the admission of the identification parade proceedings

strengthens her story.

The medical evidence reveals that the deceased had sustained one

stab injury which caused her death, this shows the murderess intentions

and the force used by the accused appellant. There had been no

provocation, no sudden fight. We find that the doctor's evidence has not

been challenged by the defence.

For the afore stated reasons we are not inclined to set aside a well

considered judgment by the High Court. We affirm the judgment delivered

on 15/02/2012 and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
