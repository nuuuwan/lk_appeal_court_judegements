Heard Counsel in support of this application. Court finds in the Magistrate

Court of Kesbewa Case No: 73224, the learned Magistrate has imposed two

years for the theft and two years for retention of stolen property and both two

run consecutively. Under the Magistrate Court the sentence is improper

therefore this Court revise the same as follows: Two years rigorous

imprisonment imposed for theft and sentence on the alternative count 396 is

removed hereby. Therefore, the convict would be serving two years rigorous

imprisonment sentence in this case.

In the next case Magistrate Court of Kesbewa in Case No: 73220 and in the

Magistrate Court Kesbewa 73226 learned Magistrate has imposed one year

each for theft and retention of stolen property. Since the retention of stolen

property is alternate count this court revise the order and removes the

conviction and sentence under section 396. Accordingly the convict serves

only one year in case No: 73226. Magistrate Court of Kesbewa in Case

No: 74786 similar order is given namely, the accused was found guilty on 367

for theft and under Section 396 for retention of stolen property count,

alternate count. This court when was the sentence imposed under section 396

accordingly the suspect in Case No: 74786 will serve on two years There is no

revision in 73225,73223,73221,73222,74785,74786.

In case No: 87627 M.C. Kesbewa Case No: 87627 the Magistrate has imposed

three months for an offence committed under Section 183 and two years for an

offence committed under 314 two years for an offence under Section 221 and

21(1) for an offence committed under 410 of the Penal Code. The total becomes

six years which is in excess of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate. Hence this

Court revise the order made under Section 314 and 221 of the Penal Code

imposes two years R.I each and makes order to run concurrently. Therefore in

Case No 87627 the suspect will serve four years R.I. and Prison Authorities to
