JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Complainant- Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 1st Respondent) had filed an information in the Primary

t i .

~ 4

Court of Embilipitiya under section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act No.44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), complaining to the

learned Primary Court Judge about an existence of a breach of peace

between two parties over a dispute relating to the land relevant to the

dispute in this case.

1 st party - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and

referred to as the Respondent) and the 2nd party - Petitioner - Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Appellant) were

named as the two rival parties in the said information.

Learned Magistrate having inquired into the said complaint, by his order

dated 2011-11-29, had directed that the Respondent be restored in

possession of the land in dispute. This was because the learned Primary

Court Judge was satisfied thatthe Appellant had dispossessed the

Respondent.

Learned Primary Court Judge, on this basis, had ordered that the

Respondent be entitled to the peaceful possession of the land in dispute.

i J 5 , ,

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Primary Court Judge, the

Appellant had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Embilipitiya, urging the Provincial High

Court to revise the order made by the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court, by its order dated 2012-03-14, had refused to

issue notices on the Respondents and proceeded to dismiss the said

revision application.

It is the said order that the Appellant seeks to canvass in this appeal before

this Court.

It would be relevant to bear in mind that the appeal before this Court is an

appeal against an order pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the

exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the task before this Court is

not to consider an appeal against the Primary Court order but to consider

whether the said refusal to issue notices on the Respondents by the

Provincial High Court is justifiable or not.

6

I Upon perusal of the order made by the learned Primary Court Judge, this f f Court is also of the view that there are ample reasons to satisfy itself with

legality propriety and the regularity of the impugned proceedings. Thus, it

is the view of this Court that there had been no basis for the Provincial ,

I

High Court to issue notices on the Respondents.

Section 74 (2) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act has specifically taken

away the right of appeal against any determination or order made under

the provisions of its part VII. The primary object of proceedings under that

part is to prevent breach of peace amongst the parties disputing the claims

for possession of lands. The Court when exercising this jurisdiction would

take only a preventive action. The order that would be made is of a

provisional nature pending final adjudication of rights in a civil Court.

This Court has perused the judgments of the learned Provincial High Court

Judge as well as the judgment of the learned Primary Court Judge. It

shows to the satisfaction of this Court that they have come to the correct

conclusions in their judgments.

In these circumstances, this Court is unable to find any basis to interfere

with the order made by the learned Provincial High Court.

Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
