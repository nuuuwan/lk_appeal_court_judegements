P. Padman Surasena 1

Counsel : Romesh de Silva PC for the Petitioner.

Faiz Musthapa PC and Avendra Rodrigo appeared to look

after the interests of the Respondents.

Decided on: 2017-01-24

ORDER

P Padman Surasena 1

The Petitioner in his application prays inter alia,

(a) that summons be issued on the pt, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents in

order to direct them to show cause as to why each one of them

should not be punished for contempt of the High Court of the

Western Province Holden in Colombo (exercising civil jurisdiction)

(b) that they be convicted and punished according to law, for the said

act of contempt!

It is the position of the Petitioner that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th

Respondents have, by their actions mentioned in the petition, willfully,

1 prayers are described more fully at page 12 of the petition.

4

deliberately and intentionally violated the interim order of the High

Court and that amounts to committing the offence of contempt of the

High Court.

The interim order referred to above was issued in terms of the prayers (f)

and (g) of the case bearing No. H C (Civil 14/2016 (CO). The said prayers

was to the following effect.

f) an interim order restraining the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents and/

or anyone or more of them from appointing any Directors and/ or

seeking to fill any vacancy on the board of the Mackwoods Securities

(Private) Limited until the conclusion of the Extraordinary General

Meeting requisitioned by requisition dated 2016-05-12 annexed to

the petition marked "P 11";

g) an interim order restraining the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents

and/or anyone or more of them from acting in contravention of the

Articles of Association of Mackwoods Securities (Private) Limited.

When this case was taken up on 2016-10-08 before us for the learned

President's counsel appearing for the Petitioner to support for notices,

5

learned counsel who appeared for the Respondents raised their objections

with regard to the maintainability of this case before this court.

Upon their request, learned counsel for all the parties were thereafter

allowed to file written submissions before this court in respect of that

issue.

However none of them has filed written submissions or any other

document pursuant to that agreement.

According to the caption of the Petition, the Petitioner has filed this

application to invoke the jurisdiction vested in this court by virtue of Article

105 (3) of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka read together with chapter LXV of the Civil Procedure Code for the

punishment of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Respondents for contempt of court.

It would be convenient to reproduce here Article 105 (3) of the

constitution which is as follows.

"The Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and the Court of Appeal

of the Republic of Sri Lanka shall each be a superior court of record and

shall have all the powers of such court including the power to punish for

contempt of itself, whether committed in the court itself or elsewhere,

6

with imprisonment or fine or both as the court may deem fit. The power of

the Court of Appeal shall include the power to punish for contempt of any

other court, tribunal or institution referred to in paragraph 1 (c) of this

Article, whether committed in the presence of such court or elsewhere:

Provided that the preceding provisions of this Article shall not prejudice or

affect the rights now or hereafter vested by any law in such other court,

tribunal or institution to punish for contempt of itself."

Since paragraph 1 (c) has been refered to above, it is necessary to have a

look at that, at this moment.

Article 105 (1) is as follows;

"Subject to the provisions of the Constitution, the institutions for the

administration of justice which protect, vindicate and enforce the rights of

people shall be-

(a) the Supreme Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka,

(b) the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Sri Lanka,

(c) the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka and such other

Courts of First Instance, tribunals or such institutions as

parliament may from time to time ordain and establish."

7

It is to be noted that section 18 of the Judicature Act has specifically

provided the High Court with the jurisdiction to deal with instances where

contempt of court and has also specified the sentence that it could impose

on such accused.

Section 18 of the Judicature Act is as follows;

" The High Court shall have power and authority to take cognizance of and

try in a summary manner any offence of contempt committed against or in

disrespect of its authority, and on conviction to commit the offender to jail

for a period not exceeding five years. Such imprisonment shall be simple

or rigorous as the court shall direct and the offender may, in addition

thereto, or in lieu thereof, in the discretion of the court be sentenced to

pay a fine not exceeding five thousand rupees."

The proviso found in Article 105 (3) clearly lays down that the power of

the Court of Appeal to punish for contempt of any other court, tribunal or

institution referred to in paragraph 1 (c), shall not prejudice or affect the

rights now or hereafter vested by any law in such other court, tribunal or

institution to punish for contempt of itself. Thus it is clear that section 18

of the Judicature Act must operate independently. Therefore the High

Court shall have power and authority to take cognizance of and try in a

summary manner any offence of contempt committed against or in

disrespect of its authority.

The interim orders issued by the High Court above referred to, had been

granted as recently as 2016-05-13, by the High Court of Western Province

holden in Colombo (exercising civil jurisdiction). It is to be noted that the

main case is still pending before that High Court and the orders that are

alleged to have been violated by the Respondents are interim orders that

the learned High Court Judge had made at the very first instance of the

case.

The case record containing all the relevant material as well as all the

relevant parties are already before the said High Court. If the Respondents

have violated the interim orders granted by the High Court thus

committing an offence of contempt, the question arises as to why the said

High Court cannot deal with this case particularly when it has been

specifically vested with such power by the legislature. Similarly the

question as to why in those circumstances this court should entertain this

case when it is clearly a matter which should come under the purview of

the High Court.

9

One has to bear in mind in this regard that in our system of law, the Court

of Appeal is considered as one of the two superior courts of record2 It

also has to be borne in mind that the main function of the Court of Appeal

is to deal with appeals as its very name "Court of Appeal" denotes.

The other aspect which has to be highlighted at this moment is that this is

a case involving exercise of original jurisdiction (as opposed to the

appellate jurisdiction).

Although Article 105 (3) of the Constitution has enabled the Court of

Appeal to punish for contempt of any court, tribunal or other institution

referred to in paragraph 1 (c) of that Article, it should not be taken as if, it

is the Court of Appeal that should deal with all the situations of

committing contempt of court in any of those institutions referred to in

paragraph 1 (c)

of that Article throughout the whole country.

Number of judges deSignated to those institutions referred to in paragraph

1 (c) of that Article is indeed very much more than the mere twelve

judges in the Court of Appeal. 3 Thus it is manifestly clear that it would not

be practically possible for this Court to deal with all such contempt matters

if litigants from all over the country start filing such cases before the Court

2 Article 105(3) of the Constitution

3 Article 137 of the Constitution.

10

of Appeal. In these circumstances it is clear that the power given to the

Court of Appeal by Article 105 (3) of the constitution is a power which the

Court of Appeal may use when necessary in circumstances that it thinks

warrants the exercise of that power.

The petitioner has not adduced any acceptable reason as to why it is the

Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal alone which should deal with this

case. There is absolutely no bar for the Petitioner to file this case in the

very High Court before which the very case is pending. Indeed it would be

the learned High Court Judge who is already possessed of the facts and

circumstances of this case and who has access to all the material adduced

in this case, who would undoubtedly be the best judge to deal with this

case.

This court has taken a similar view in the case of Metthananda Vs. Kushan

Fernando4 in which a similar objection was upheld by this court. This

court dismissed that application and directed the Petitioner to institute that

action in the District Court where the alleged subject matter of the

complaint was said to have been occurred.

11

In these circumstances we are of the view that it is not the Court of

Appeal in which the Petitioner should have filed this case. For the

foregoing reasons we refuse to entertain this case. Hence this application

must stand dismissed without costs.

The Petitioner should be free, if he so desires, to institute the proceedings

in this regard, in the High Court before which this matter is already

pending, and whose order is alleged to have been violated by the

Respondents.
