DECIDED ON:

VIJITH K.MALALGODA PC J (PICA) & S. THURAIRAJA, PC J.

Dr. Mahinda Ralapanawa with Nisansala Fernando for the Petitioner.

15.12.2016

VIJITH K. MALALGODA PC J (PICA)

The Petitioner to this application has come before this court under Article

143 of the Constitution seeking an injunction to prevent the 1st and 2nd

Respondents granting a contract to a 3rd party until the appointment of

an adjudicature under the contract between the Petitioners and the

Respondents. However when going through the papers before us, we

observe that the impugned document before this Court which is produced

marked P1 had been issued by the Secretary to Nochchiyagama

Pradeshiya Sabha terminating the contract between the Petitioners and

the Respondents Pradeshiya Sabha after expiration of agreement

between the two parties. As revealed before us the Petitioners have failed

to complete the work as agreed by the agreement between the parties and

therefore the 2nd Respondent had correctly terminated the contract. Even

though the Petitioner relied upon a document produced marked Xl said

to have written by the Project Engineer granting the Petitioner's time till

we...... 20.10.2016 to explain as to why the work was not completed..,"W observe

that the said date given by Xl is a date three dates after the expiration of

fI

2

the contract. The Petitioners have produced marked X2 an explanation

given by the Petitioners to Xl but as observed by this Court the

Petitioners have not taken any steps either to complain of delays in

completing the contract or requesting additional time to complete the

contract without explaining the reasons for the delay while the agreement

was in operation. The Petitioners are now totally depend on documents

Xl and X2 to explain their delay. However at the time the explanation

was gIven the contract had already been expired and therefore there was

no reason for the 2nd Respondent to adhere to the terms of the

contract. In the said circumstances, it is our view that this contract had

been expired and since the Petitioners could not complete the work

within the specified period the 2nd Respondent had reasons to terminate

the said contract. In the said circumstances, a necessity of adjudication

will not anse and therefore we see no reason to issue an injunction

preventing the 2nd Respondent from taking further action prior to

adjudication. This application is therefore dismissed. No cost is ordered.
