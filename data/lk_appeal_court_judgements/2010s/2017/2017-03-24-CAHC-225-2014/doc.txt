After the pronouncement of the judgment on 01.03.2017 the

Learned SDSG brought to the notice of court, that by an

oversight, court has not set aside the sentence on the

1 - 6 counts, wherein the Learned High Court Judge has

imposed a jail term of 1 year Rigorous Imprisonment for

each count and suspended for 10 years In respect of the

1 st Accused, and where the 2nd Accused IS concerned,

she was ordered 1 year Rigorous Imprisonment for count

1, 5 and 6 and was suspended for 10 years.

A cursory glance at the impugned sentence it IS contended

by the Learned SDSG that the above sentence IS obnoxious

and inimical to Section 303 (2) of the Criminal Procedure

Code, as the cumulative sentence of 6 counts exceeded

2 years, for the 1 st Accused and, for 3 counts exceeds

2 years for the 2nd Accused.

As per section stated above it is mandatory that court

shall impose a non custodial or suspended sentence when

the sentence imposed IS only two years or less than

two years.

In the above setting it is so apparent that the above

sentence imposed by the trial Judge cannot stand, as

such should be set aside and be substituted with 1

year jail term for each count to run consecutively. Thus

the above judgment dated 01.03.2017 accordingly, rectified

and varied.

Thus the Appeal IS allowed.

K.K. Wickramasinghe, J I agree.

P.R. Walgama, J

By the present appeal the Attorney General call in

question the defensibility of the judgment of conviction

and the order of sentence dated 28.08.2013, passed by

the Learned High Court Judge of High Court holden

at Colombo.

By the instant appeal the Attorney General had

assailed the said judgment and conviction as the

sentence imposed on the 1st and the 2nd accused were

2

grossly inadequate, in the attended circumstances and

urged for an enhancement of the sentence which

commensurate with the offence committed.

The shortly stated facts emanate from this appeal are

as follows;

The 1st and the 2nd Accused - Respondents were indicted

by the Attorney General for having committed an

offence punishable under Section 403 read with section

32 of the Penal Code.

It IS to be noted that both the accused being

husband and wife pleaded guilty to the charges In

the indictment, and Learned High Court Judge had

imposed the sentence and a fine as stated here

under;

In addition to the charge stated herein before both

Accused - Respondents were also charged for committing

an offence punishable under Section 2S(1)(a) of the

Debt Recovery (Special Provisions) Act No. 02 of 1990

as amended by Act No. 09 of 1994.

II[I l

~

i

The 1 st and the 2nd Accused - Respondents were indicted

for the following counts, which they pleaded guilty on

09.08.2013 and the Learned High Court Judge

imposed the following sentences.

Regorous Imprisonment for a period of one year for

each count and a fine of Rs. 5000. Further the said

jail term was imposed on all 6 counts and same was

suspended for a term of 10 years. In addition the

total fine for the 6 counts for the 1st accused was

Rs. 30,000/ and for the 2nd accused was 15,000/.

Further it lS seen that the 1 st accused was ordered

to pay a compensation of 800,000/-to the aggrieved

party ln respect of the 1 st count and carrylng a

default term of 24 months of simple imprisonment.

Being dissatisfied with the sentence imposed on the

above charges it lS urged by the counsel for the

Respondent - Appellant that the said sentence is grossly

inadequate as per charges stated ln the indictment

hereto.

Ii tf

Further it 1S also submitted that the Learned High

Court Judge has failed to 1mpose the fine provided

by section 25(1) a of the Debt Recovery (Special

Provisions) Act as amended by Act No. 09 of 1994.

For easy reference the above section 1S reproduced

herein below;

25(1) Any person

(a)- draws a cheque knowing that there are no funds

or not sufficient funds 1n the bank to honour such

cheque,

Thus the offender the above section can commit the

offence 1n two ways ie.

(i) Knowing there are no funds, draws a cheque

(ii) Knowing that there are no sufficient funds 1n

the bank to honour such cheque, draws a

cheque

Such an offender shall be punished with;

(i) Imprisonment of either description for a term

which may extend to one year, or

(ii) With a fine of Rs.I0,000/ or

(iii) Ten per centum of the full value of the

cheque .... .in respect of which the offence IS

committed which IS higher or

(iv) With both such fine and imprisonment.

But it IS seen from the sentence imposed for the

counts 2 to 6 the Learned High Court Judge has

ordered a very lenient punishment and a fine. For the

above stated counts tl1e Learned High Court Judge has

imposed a jail term of Rigorous Imprisonment for

one year suspended for 10 years and a fine of

Rs.5000 / for each count.

Therefore it IS contended by the Learned DSG that

the Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider

the intention of the Legislature in imposing the above

fine limiting to Rs.5000 / which IS gross violation or

obnoxious and inimical to the above sections(ii) and (iii)

of section 25(1) of Debt Recovery Act.

The Learned High Court Judge has imposed much

lesser fine than the fine stipulated in the above Act.

6

In strict sense it should have been ten per centum ! Iof the full value of the cheque as stated 1n the !

tcounts 2 to 6 in the indictment.

The Learned SDSG has also adverted court to the

by the Accused - Respondents to a third party on

fact that the vehicle in question has been disposed of

I!forged documents and presently a case 1S pending

against the current owner. Therefore it is contended by

the Counsel for the Appellants that the Complainant

Company had lost the money as well as the subject

matter which is the alleged motor vehicle.

Further it should be the grave concern of the trial

judge . . the sentence criminal charge, 1n 1mpos1ng on a

of the fact the gravity of the offence, the sentence

prescribed 1n the statute and the effect of the society

at large. It 1S pertinent to note that the judicial

pronouncement 1n the case of ATIORNEY GENERAL .VS.

MENDIS- (1995) 1 SLR- 138 which held thus;

"In assessing punishment the judge should consider the

matter of sentence both from the point of view the

7

public and the offender. The judge should first consider

the gravity of the offence, as it appears from the

nature of the act itself and should have regard to the

punishment provided 1n the Penal Code or other

statute under which the offender 1S charged. He

should also regard the effect of the punishment as a

deterrent and consider to what extent it will be

effective ........ two other considerations are the nature of

the loss to the victim and the profit that may accrue

to the accused 1n the event of non direction."

(emphasis added)

In considering the sentence imposed by the Learned

Trial Judge, is justifiable or not, this court 1n the

pursuit of reVIew1ng the sentence, 1S mindful of the

nature of the offence, and the way 1n which the

complainant was deceived, the manner 1n which the

accused have acted to vito when there were no funds

to issue cheques to the value as stated 1n the

indictment, and disposing of the vehicle 1n 1ssue, more

importantly leaving the place of abode and as a

result being arrested.

III,lI

In the above setting it 1S abundantly clear that the

complainant had lost 6.5 million as well as the

vehicle.

It 1S contention of the Counsel for the Accused -

Respondents that section 403 does not prescribe a

mandatory sentence, the Debt Recovery Act do not

prescribe a mandatory jail term for an offence

committed under Section 25 (l)(d). But it 1S seen that

it is mandatory that ten per centum of the value of

the cheque should be imposed as a fine. Therefore it

is crystal clear that the fine imposed by the Learned

Trial Judge grossly inadequate and illegal.

Further to have imposed a parole order or a

suspended sentence for 6 counts is contrary to section

303 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

It is observed from the sentence imposed for the 1st

count, 1 year Rigorous Imprisonment, suspended for 10

years and Rs. 5000/ as a fine and 1n addition Rs.

800,000/ as a compensation to be paid to the

complainant, with a default term of 24 months.

9

III [i ,

fI

Before directing any variation of the sentence this

court will take in to consideration their age and is not

persuaded to increase the jail term as, already a term

of default sentence has been imposed on the 1 st

Accused - Respondent. Nevertheless considering the above

factual and legal matrix this court is inclined to vary

the sentence to the extent of . . ImposIng a ten per

centum of the value of each check as per count 2 to

6 and carryIng a default term of 1 year on each

count (count 2 to 6) to run consecutively.

Subject to the above variation appeal IS allowed In

part.

Accordingly the appeal IS partly allowed.

K.K. Wickramasinghe, J I agree.
