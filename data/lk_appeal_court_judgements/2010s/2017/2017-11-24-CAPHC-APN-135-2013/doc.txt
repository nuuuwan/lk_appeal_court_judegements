Heard submissions of Counsels;

The Counsel for the Accused Appellant, submits that he is not contesting the

conviction but, he is challenging the sentence. He says, that the sentencing policy is

not considered by the learned trial Judge and submits that sentencing theories and

Policies were not taken into consideration. Further, he invites us to consider the

sentencing policy pronounced by the Supreme Court in 3/2008. The Learned Deputy

Solicitor General submits that she is supporting the conviction and submits that the

sentence is appropriate and well deserved. The Learned Trial Judge had considered

the entire case. The Victim was 9 years and few months old, School going child. She

was taken away from the school on a false pretext in her school uniform by a 63 old

person and involved in committing sexual activities as described in the indictment.

After a full trial held in the High Court, the Accused was found guilty, it is our duty

was found guilty, it is our duty to see the evidence for the Prosecution and the

accused, there we find that the accused had completely denied and said that the

allegation was made to take revenge on him. We are mindful of facts and the

defence taken in the trial. Section 365 was brought to Sri Lankan legal system by

way of amendment to Penal Code 22 of 1995. Sri Lanka is a signatory to United

Nation's Child Right's Charter. In the said Charter Article 3 states "In all actions

concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare

institutions, Court of Law, administrative authorities or Legislative bodies,

the best interest of the child shall be primary consideration"

The question arisen whether the same concept is being used by the Learned Trial

Judge. We are possessed of the Judgment and the reasoning for the Sentence of the

Learned Trial Judge. He had given opportunity for both Counsel to make

submissions and he was possessed of all the aggravating and mitigatory

circumstances before he passed the sentence. The judicially trained minded judge

has imposed the sentence after considering several factors including recognizing the

said offence as an inhuman and hatred by the society. Further the child is a tender

child and she had to abundant her education. This shows, for the few second

pleasure of a person can destroy the life of a person. And we take note of the

observations made by the High Court Judge very seriously. We take this

opportunity to visit the reasons stated in Karunaratne's Case which is not directly

applicable to this case but, we are mindful of the concerns of the Court. The

Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant invited us to follow the principle of SC

determination in 3/2008. The circumstances declared there is not applicable to this

,. -4

case. The counsel submits the age has to be considered favourable to the accused.

Considering the age at the time of the incident the same submissions can go

against the Accused. A person of 63 years of age in our country is virtually not only

respected but, also venered by the youngsters. Person of that calibre abusing a

child of 9 years cannot be accepted by any means. We are in total agreement with

the sentence passed by the Learned Trial Judge. In the same time we are mindful of

the delay in the system. The trial and the appeal has delayed beyond the control of

the accused appellant. Therefore, giving the concession to the Accused appellant we

intent to operate the sentence from the date of conviction because the accused

Appellant was incarcerated.

We dismiss the Appeal and direct the Prison Authority to implement the sentence

from the date of conviction namely 28.06.2013. Registrar is hereby directed to

forward the case record to the Registrar of High Court of Matara for the

implementation of sentence.

Appeal dismissed.
