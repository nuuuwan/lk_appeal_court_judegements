This revision application is preferred to set aside the order dated

14.06.2016 of the Learned High Court Judge to grant Bail to the 2nd

Suspect of Saiyadhu Mohamed Mumdai Begam and for cost on 31 st

August 2015 and the 2nd Suspect was arrested by the Officer-in-Charge

of the Police Station Illavalai and produced before Mallakam

Magistrate Court and remanded. The allegation levelled against the 2nd

Suspect was illegal transport of Cannabis indica in weight of 40 kilos

and 192 grams.

The 2nd Suspect deny that allegation levelled against him. The 2nd

Suspect is the father of five children and the sole bread winner of his

family and the detention of the suspect has severely affected his family.

The 2nd Suspect has neither any previous conviction nor any pending

cases. The 2nd Suspect has preferred an application for a bail under and

in terms of section 83(1) of the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs

Ordinance.

Being aggrieved by the order of the Learned High Court Judge the

petitioner preferred this application.

The Learned SSC raised a preliminary objection as to the

maintainability of this action in that the Petitioner has no locus standi

to present this application and does not have any locus standi to

maintain this revision application and moved to dismiss this application

in limine. He also contended that there are no exceptional grounds for

this court to act in revision.

We have considered the application of the Petitioner who is the wife

of the 2nd Suspect. However we find that the Petitioner has no locus

standi to make this application since she has not tendered her marriage

certificate and has not tendered any valid proof that she is an aggrieved

party. Further there are no exceptional circumstances pleaded in the

petition.

In the case ofSenatilake Vs. AG 19982 SLR 290 the court held that

the father of the accused has no locus standi to maintain a revision

application or challenge a conviction.

In the case of Son ali Fernando Vs. A.G. CA(PHC) APN 144/07 is

a revision application filed by the wife of the convict to quash and

reverse the conviction. The Court held that the wife has no locus standi

to prosecute the application.

In the case ofCA(PHC) APN No. 64/09 held that period of remand

cannot be considered as an exceptional circumstance.

"If an accused cannot assign exceptional circumstances he

will have to keep on remand and when an accused had been in

remand for 03 years, because he had no exceptional

circumstances will that by itself constitute exceptional

circumstances. If that is treated as an exceptional

circumstance, in my view it would be an anomaly because the

fact that there aren't any exceptional circumstances becomes a

qualification after 3 years. "

In the case of CA (PHC)APN 63/2015 L.T.B. Dehideniya J, stated

that;

"The Petitioner's argument that a long period of

incarceration can be considered as an exceptional

circumstance cannot be applied to a case under this ordinance.

Section 83 of the Ordinance made it mandatory to keep an

accused person or a person suspected for an offence of this

nature in remand custody until the conclusion of the case unless

there are exceptional circumstances to release on bail.

6

Therefore, long period of remanding does not contribute to

constitute exceptional circumstances. "

Likewise family commitments also cannot be considered as an

exceptional circumstance. The accused is a father of six children and

his children are still attending school was not considered as exceptional

circumstance. Vide: Ramu Thamtharampillai Vs. AG(SC 141/75)

No previous conviction cannot be considered as an exceptional

circumstance. Vide: Ramu Thamotharampillai Vs. AG(SC 141175).

As such we are of the view that there is no reason as to why we should

interfere with the order of the learned High Court Judge.

Hence we dismiss this revision application with costs.

I agree.
