The Petitioners instituted this writ application on the basis that they were

the Chairman and the General Secretary of the political party called Sri

Lanka Progressive Front (SLPF). The Petitioners state that the 1 st

Petitioner was appointed as the Chairman in the year 2000 and the 2nd

Petitioner was appointed as the General Secretary on the 2ih of January

2001 and they are still holding the said positions in the SLPF. They

complain that several others have informed the 6th Respondent, the

Commissioner of Elections, claiming to be the Chairman and the General

Secretary and it had resulted in rejecting the nomination paper tendered

for the presidential election in 2010. The Petitioners have communicated

to the 6th Respondent requesting him to accept the 2nd Petitioner as the

General Secretary of the party but the 6th Respondent by the letter dated

04.12.2013 marked as PI0 informed the Petitioners that there is a dispute

within the party as to the post of General Secretary and therefore until the

matter is resolved amicably within the party or by an order of a Court, he

cannot accept anyone as the General Secretary of the SLPF. The

petitioners are seeking a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to

quash the said letter marked PI 0 and a writ of mandamus directing the 6th

Respondent to accept the 2nd Petitioner as the General Secretary of the

party. Further they are seeking a writ of mandamus directing the 6th

Respondent to recognize the said SLPF as a political party.

The Petitioners marked the party constitution as PI and stated that all

documentations of the party has to be issued under the signature of the

Chairman and the General Secretary, but the documentation forwarded to

the 6th Respondent by the 5th Respondent was not signed by Chairman

and it has no validity in law. Further they submit that the persons claimed

to be the Chairman and ~he General Secretary were not properly elected

by the party.

The 6th Respondent in his objections stated that the SLPF is a recognized

political party and there is no necessity to issue a writ of mandamus

directing him to recognize the SLPF as a political party. He further stated

that PI is a copy of the constitution send to him in 1994 and he further

received party constitutions dated 03.03.1996, 30.11.1996, 30.11.1997

and 30.12.2009 and were marked as 6R1(a), 6RI(b), 6RI(c) and 6RI(d)

respectively. There are changes to the position taken by the Petitioners.

The other Respondents also have filed objections denying the petitioners

stand.

The Petitioners do not complain that the decision of the 6th Respondent

not to accept anyone as the General Secretary is ultra vires or it violates

the rules of natural justice or it is an arbitrary, capricious or illegal order.

The Petitioners complaint is that it is based on wrong factual assertions.

The 6th Respondent has come in to the conclusion that there is a dispute in

the party as to who i~ the lawful General Secretary, on the material

received by him. He received several party constitutions time to time. The

Petitioners in their counter affidavit dated 09.06.2015 in paragraph 08

have admitted that the constitution was amended and admitted that the

copies marked as 6R1(a) and 6R1(b) as correct documents. The

petitioners did not disclose that the party constitution was amended and

failed to tender the constitution in force. Further the petitioners have

admitted the document marked 6R3 as a correct document. The

Petitioners refer to the document marked as 6R3 as a copy of the

constitution but it is not. It is a letter issued by the 2nd Respondent to the

6th Respondent claiming that he is the General Secretary of the SLPF.

The 6th Respondent on good and valid reasons has decided that there is a

dispute in the party to the post of General Secretary. His decision is not to

accept anyone until the matter is resolved.

If the factual situation is in dispute, the Court cannot grant a mandate in

the nature of a writ until the facts are been cleared. This Court has no

Ifl

opportunity to verify the correctness of the facts. It has been held in the

case of Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board [1981] 2 Sri L R 471 that

Where the major facts are in dispute and the legal result of the

facts is subject to controversy and it is necessary that the questions

should be canvassed in a suit where parties would have ample

opportunity of examining the witnesses so that the Court would be

better able to judge which version is correct, a writ will not issue.

Mandamus is pre-eminently a discretionary remedy. It is an

extraordinary, residuary and suppletory remedy to be granted only

when there is no other means of obtaining justice. Even though all

other requirements for securing the remedy have been satisfied by

the applicant, the court will decline to exercise its discretion in his

favour if a specific alternative remedy like a regular action equally

convenient, beneficial and effective is available.

The Petitioners are seeking for a writ of mandamus directing the 6th

Respondent to accept the 2nd Petitioner as the General Secretary. Ones the

matter is resolved the 6th Respondent will accept the General Secretary,

no need to issue a writ.

Under these circumstances I refuse to issue the writs and dismiss the

application.
