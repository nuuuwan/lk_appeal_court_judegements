This appeal projects a challenge to the judgment dated

17.05.2013, rendered by the Learned High Court Judge,

by which judgment the Accused - Appellant was sentenced

to death for the murder of his wife by setting fire to

her body.

At this juncture this Court is called upon to answer

one issue viz a -viz whether the Learned High Court Judge

had jurisdiction to proceed with the criminal trial which

was partly heard, by the predecessor, of course after

adopting the proceedings. The cnsp lssue under

consideration is that the failure of the Learned High

Court Judge to adhere to the Section 48 of the

Judicature Act.

Therefore it is contended by the counsel for the Accused

- Appellant that as per above Section 48, since this case

was transferred from the High Court of Kandy to High

2

Court of Nuwaraeliya the case should have been started

afresh.

It is viewed from the proceedings of the record of the

original court that on 02.09.2008, the indictment served

and read out in the High Court of Kandy. The evidence

of witness No.1 was led and after cross examination the

evidence of the said witness was concluded.

After the establishment of the Provincial High Court of

Nuweraeliya this case was transferred to the said High

Court, as this case came under the Jurisdiction of

Nuwaraeliya.

It is alleged by the counsel for the Accused - Appellant,

that the Learned High Court Judge has failed to adopt

the proceedings recorded at the High Court of Kandy.

Nevertheless it is observed from the proceedings dated

18.06.2012, the Learned High Court Judge had formally

adopted the proceedings recorded by his predecessor and

had proceeded to trial.

It is also contended by the counsel for the Accused-

Appellant, that there is no statutory provlslOn to adopt

3

the proceedings that had been recorded 1n the High

Court of Kandy, and subsequently in the High Court of

Nuwaraeliya with or without the concurrence of the

parties.

The adoption of proceedings 1n a existing trial 1S

recognized in section 48 of the Judicature Act No. 2 of

1978 as amended by Act No. 27 of 1999 which states

thus;

" In the case of death, sickness, resignation, removal from

office, absence from Sri lanka or other disability of any

judge before whom any action, prosecution, proceeding or

matter, whether on any inquiry preliminary to committal

for trial or otherwise has been instituted or is pending,

such action, prosecution, proceeding or matter may be

continued before the successor of such judge who shall

have the power to act on the evidence already recorded

by the predecessor, or partly recorded by his predecessor

and partly recorded by him or, if he thinks fit to

resummon the witness and commence the proceedings

afresh."

4

"provided that where any criminal prosecution, proceeding

or matter (except on an inquiry preliminary to committal

for trial) is continued before the successor of any such

judge, the accused may demand that the witness be

resummoned and reheard."

Further it is submitted by the counsel for the Accused

- Appellant, that in the absence of any statutory prOVISIOn

to adopt the proceedings when the jurisdiction of a

Court is changed it is incumbent on the Trial Judge to

have ordered a trial de novo, thus the Learned Trial

Judge has flawed by adopting a procedure inimical to

the same.

It is apposite to mention that the Legislature has not

contemplated of a situation of this nature before and the

current issue has not been anticipated by the Legislature

even to lay down a procedure. This situation has arIsen

due the expansion of the Court structure. In the above

setting it IS the duty of court to be mindful and

observe the rules of a fair trial and afford an opportunity

to the Accused to be heard.

5

The original case record bears testimony to the effect

that the Learned High Court Judge who concluded the

trial had adopted the proceedings, of course with the

consent of the parties. It is been noted that the Accused

- Appellant was glVen an opportunity either to consent

to adopt the proceedings and continue with the trial

or to make an application to start the case de novo.

Therefore it is intensely relevant to note that the Learned

High Court Judge has followed the 'cardinal rule' of

affording a fair trial to the Accused.

For the reasons stated herein before, the preliminary

objection raised by the counsel for the Accused - Appellant

has no merit and thus it IS over ruled.
