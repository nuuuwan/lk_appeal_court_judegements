Accused - Appellant is present in Court produced by the Prison Authorities.

Counsel for the Accused - Appellant submits that he has instructions to

withdraw the appeal and he pleads with the Court to act under Sections 359 and

328 of the Criminal Procedure Code and moving the Court to make the sentence

to run concurrent because as per the indictment these two offences were indicted

under the same course of transaction. Further, the accused appellant is in

remand from the date of conviction. Therefore, he wants the sentence to be

implemented from the date of remand. Senior State Counsel informs Court that

he has no objection for the withdrawal of the Appeal. He submits that he has no

objection of implementing the sentence from the date of conviction. But he is

objecting to implement the sentence concurrently.

We considered the submissions of both counsel and we perused the order

delivered by the learned High Court Judge and we find that the Accused

Appellant was 19 years at the time of the incident and the victim was 14 years.

Considering the nature of the offence and the indictment we find that the

Attorney General has indicted the Accused Appellant on two counts which

happened in the same course of transaction.

Further, the sentence gIven IS fairly reasonable namely, 12 years

imprisonment and 3 years imprisonment. Considering all circumstances

especially considering the age of the Accused Appellant we decide to implement

the sentence concurrently. Both the sentences will be implemented concurrently.

For the purpose of certainty the sentence of the Accused Appellant stands as

follows:

The sentence given for the first offence under Section 357 of the Penal

Code 3 years and the sentence of 12 years given under Section 364 (2) will be

implemented together. All the other fine and the compensation ordered will stand

as it is. Further, the Accused Appellant is in remand from the date of conviction.

Therefore the sentence would be implemented from the date of conviction.

The Prison Authority is hereby directed to implement the sentence from the date

of conviction namely 27.03.2013.

! r

Subject to variation of the sentence the Appeal is dismissed.

Registrar is hereby directed to return the case record to the Registrar of High

Court of Chillaw to implement the sentence.
