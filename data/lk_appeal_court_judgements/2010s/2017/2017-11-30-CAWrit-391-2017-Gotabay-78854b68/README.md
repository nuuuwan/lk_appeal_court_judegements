This is an applic(ltion for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

certiorari to quash the certificate marked as A30 with the petition, issued

I under section 8(1) of the Offences Against the Public Property Act, by

the 4th Respondent, certifying that the there is dishonest misappropriation

of public property (money) worth ofRs. 90,831,165.02.

The Petitioner's contention is that there is no misappropriation of

any money in the transaction. It is only a commercial transaction. Further

the certificate on the face of it is wrong.

The Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation

(Corporation) was established under the Act No. 15 Of 1968. The

Corporation has the power to enter in to construction contracts.

The Petitioner's contention is that the D.A.Rajapaksa Foundation

(Foundation) had entered in to a contract with the Corporation to

construct a Monument on a cost of Rs. 33 million. The Petitioner has not

submitted any written construction contract to establish the contract. He

states that it was a verbal contract. To establish that there was a contract,

he submitted the minutes of the Corporation where the Corporation had

decided to go ahead with the construction and to recover the agreed

amount of Rupees 33 million later. This decision was taken at the 53ih

meeting of the Board of Directors of the Corporation held on the 26th

February 2014, the minutes were filed of record at page 270 and the said

decision is at page 273. A direct contract with the Foundation is not

establish even by this decision of the Corporat~on but it is clear that the

construction was undertaken by the Corporation with the intention of

recovering the money later. Thereafter the Corporation had constructed

the monument. The Foundation on 4th August 2015 sent a letter to the

Corporation requesting them to submit a bill for the construction. The

letter is in the page 275/352 of the record. In reply to this letter, the

Corporation has sent an interim reply on 21 st August 2015 indicating that

the final bill is under preparation and requested the Foundation to pay

Rupees 25 million as a part payment, where the Foundation had paid on

31.08.2015. (page 345) The Foundation had paid Rupees 8,944,741.60

too as a part payment as per the page 350 of the record, where the date of

payment (the year) is not clear. In the meantime, the Corporation had

forwarded the final bill amounting to Rupees 81,313,374.14. The learned

President's Counsel submits that the Foundation admits the liability to

pay, but they contest the balance amount. The Attorney at Law for the

Corporation had send a letter of demand dated 1st June 2016 marked as

A29 to the Foundation requesting them to pay the balance of Rupees

56,313,374.14 which is in accordance with the final bill submitted by the

Corporation, and informed that in failure to comply, legal action will be

instituted to recover the same. Interestingly, this letter was addressed to

4

the Chairmen of the Foundation and copies were sent to the Council

members including the Petitioner.

The learned President Counsel submits that this is a commercial

transaction entered into by and between the Corporation and the

Foundation. The minutes of the Corporation indicate that the Corporation

had commenced the construction work with the intention of recovering

the money later and the Foundation had made paym~nts according to

their estimation. There is no agreement as to the balance amount due. The

Corporation had issued a letter of demand to the Foundation claiming the

balance according to their calculation, with a threat of instituting legal

action if fails to comply. All these sequential steps have been established

by the Petitioner by tendering the relevant evidence.

The learned President's Counsel further argues that there IS no

dishonest misappropriation. Under section 22 of the Penal Code,

dishonesty is defined as "Whoever does anything with the intention of

causing wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another person,

is said to do that thing "dishonestly". In the instant case the Petitioner

had not gained anything wrongfully and there is no wrongful loss to any

person. The Counsel further argues that there is no misappropriation.

Counsel argues that it to be a misappropriation, firstly there should be an

appropriation of the money for his own use, but in the instant case there is

no appropriation by the Petitioner.

In the instant case, the monument was constructed by the

Corporation on a contract entered into with the Foundation and the

Foundation had no intention of defrauding.

In the case of Attorney-General v. Dewapriya Walgamage and

another [1990] 2 Sri L R 212 it was held that;

1. (a) There are two basic ingredients to the offence of criminal

misappropriation under S. 386 of the Penal Code

i. A mental element of dishonesty, and

ii. An act of misappropriation or conversion of movable

property to his own use by the accused

In the present case there is evidence to establish that there was no

mental element of dishonesty and no misappropriation. (

The amount of money that was said to have dishonestly

misappropriated by the Petitioner is mentioned in the certificate as

Rupees 90,813,165.02. As per the final bill of the Corporation the total

bill was Rupees 81,313,374.14. Out of this amount, Rupees 33 million

had been paid in two occasions. Even if the total amount is considered as

due, it is not the amount mentioned in the certificate.

Attorney General Palitha Fernando PC (as he was then) in a

discussion paper on "Prosecutorial Discretion: The Sri Lankan Aspect"

published in the Junior Law Journal 2013 Vol. IV, expressed the view

that in exercising the prosecutorial discretion "The decision should be

based on the available evidence, the admissibility of the evidence and the

possibility of securing a conviction on the basis of such material. " I agree

with the view expressed by the former Attorney General and this should

apply not only to the Attorney General but in the equal force to the other

prosecutors such as the Police Officers who take part in the prosecution

process.

Under these circumstances, the impugned certificate marked A30

issued by the 4th Respondent if ex facie wrong and the evidence available

is contrary to the correctness of the facts contained in the certificate.

The Petitioner has established a prima facie case that the certificate

marked A30 is incorrect. If an interim order is not issued, the application

will become nugatory.

I issue an interim order as prayed for in the paragraph (d) of the

prayer to the petition to be valid until the next date of hearing.

I further order to issue notice to the Respondents.
