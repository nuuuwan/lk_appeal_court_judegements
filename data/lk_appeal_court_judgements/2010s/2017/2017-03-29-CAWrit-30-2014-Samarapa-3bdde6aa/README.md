The said Petitioners have come before this court seeking inter alia,

b) issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the purported appointment letter

dated 09th November 2011 issued by the 1st Respondent appointing the i h Respondent to the

post of Registrar of Births, Deaths of the Hendala Division and Registrar of Marriages

(General) of the Southern Aluthkuru Korale Division within the Divisional Secretarial Division

of Wattala in the District of Gampaha.

c) issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the purported appointment letter

dated 24th October 2011 issued by the 4th Respondent appointing the i h Respondent to the post

of Registrar of Births, Deaths of the Hendala Division and Registrar of Marriages (General) of

the Southern Aluthkuru Korale Division within the Divisional Secretarial Division of Wattala

in the District of Gampaha.

d) issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus to direct anyone or more of the 1st to 6th

Respondents to appoint anyone of the Petitioners whose names appear in the notice dated

14.06.2011 (P4) (however except Palihawadana Arachchige Bernard Cyril Perera Jayawardena

who did not attend the interview held on 01.07.2011) to the post of Registrar of Births, Deaths

of the Hendala Division and Registrar of Marriages (General) of the Aluthkuru Korale Division

in the Gampaha District

According to the said Petitioners, the 4th Respondent to the present application by the notice published

in the Gazette (extra ordinary) No 1672 dated 17th September 2010 had called for applications for the

above post from those who were eligible to be appointed for the said post.

All the Petitioners who had necessary qualifications as referred to in the said Gazette notification, had

applied to the said post within the stipulated time period.

4

Subsequently, on or about 14th June 2011, the 1st Respondent had published and displayed a notice

stating that an interview will be held on 1st July 2011 at the Gampaha Divisional Secretariat at 9.30 am

to select a suitable candidate for the said post. The Petitioners have heavily relied on the said notice

which was produced before this court marked P-4.

According to the said document, P-4,

a) It contained 7 names of the applicants to the above post, including the names of the 5

Petitioners before this court along with two others namely, Hettiarachchige Soma Malani

Kulatunga and Palihawadana Arachchige Bernard Cyril Perera Jayawardena

b) It was displayed in public places including the District and Divisional Secretariats and Grama

Niladhari Offices of Gampaha District and the public were called upon to express their views

in favour or against any of the applicants above named at the time of the interview

c) The public were noticed to submit their views in favour or against the said applicants to reach

the 2nd Respondent prior to the interview in writing

d) Any objections raised after interview would not be considered

On or about the 1 i h October 2011, the Petitioners received information that the i h Respondent, whose

name was not appeared in P-4 had been appointed to the said post. (P-5 and P-6)

According to the Petitioners, they were surprised by the said appointment and therefore send a letter to

the 6th Respondent objecting to the said appointment. (P-7) Mter sending the said objections, the

Petitioners received a letter from the 4th Respondents dated 30.01.2012 informing that due to an

inadvertence the objections could not be called for three other applicants including the ih Respondent,

and therefore calling for objections with regard to their applications on or before 05.03.2012.(P-8 and

P-9)

However during the argument before this court it was revealed that the Petitioners who filed objections

with the 4th Respondent, did not take part in the said inquiry, since the Petitioners have gone before the

Supreme Court by way of a Fundamental Rights application. In the absence of any participation at the

inquiry conducted, before the 4th Respondent, no adverse order was made against the i h Respondent.

As observed by this court, the Petitioners main submission before this court was, that,

a) the i h Respondent's name was never appeared in the said P-4 notice, calling for any objections

to the i h Respondent been appointed for the said post

b) the general public had been deprived of their right to express their opposition or objection to

the i h Respondent been appointed to the said post

c) the said appointment of the i h Respondent to the said post was contrary to the legitimate

expectation of the Petitioners

When observing the submissions made by the said Petitioners', it was further revealed that the

Petitioners contention was that the i h Respondent who was not present at the interview on 1st July

2011 had been appointed to the said post and issued a letter of appointment to that effect.

However when responding to the above arguments of the Petitioners', the 1 st to 6th Respondents took

up the position that,

a) Ten applications including those from the Petitioners and the i h Respondent for the post of

Registrar of Births and Deaths in Hendala Division and Registrar of Marriages (General) in

Southern Aluthkurau Koralaya Division had been received by the Respondents

b) Individual letters dated 20th June 2011 were sent requiring each applicant to be present for an

interview on 1 sl July 2011 including the i h Respondent

Respondents marked R-3.

d) The interview proceeded as scheduled on 01.07.2011 and eight out of ten applicants attended

the interview, were assessed on the basis of marks obtained at the written and oral tests were

the ihRespondent had scored the highest

e) The omission to include the name of the i h Respondent in the notice calling for objections (P-

4) was rectified by giving a future time period for such objection against the rest of the

candidates, including the i h Respondent

Whilst referring to the above facts the Respondents took up the position that, the only laps they

observed during the process of conducting the interview was rectified by giving further time, the

moment the matter was raised by the Petitioners, but the said laps alone had not vitiated the written

examination and the interview conducted impartially for all the candidates who presented for the

interview on 01.07.2011 as scheduled.

Even though the Petitioners challenged the above position and took up the position that the i h

Respondent was not present for the interview on 01.07.2011 in the absence of her name in P-4, the

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General who represented 15t to 6th Respondents whilst challenging the

above contention, under took to produce the necessary documents before this court. On the directions

given by this court, 2 (a) added Respondent had produced before this court the interview sheets and

1II I

the attendance register with regard to the interview conducted on 01.07.2011 to select the Registrar of

Births and Deaths in Hendala Division and Registrar of Marriages (General) in Southern Aluthkuru

Koralaya Division in the Gamapaha District.

As observed by us, the attendance register produced before this court contained eight names and the

interview sheets confirmed that the said eight persons had participated the interview on 01.07.2011. In

the said attendance sheet which was filled by the individual applicants, the i h Respondent had written

her name and signed as the i h person and the 1st to the 5th Respondent have written their names and

signed at the 1st, 5t\ 6th, sth and 4th places respectively and Raddadduwa Pathirathnage Nandawathy

Pathirathne whose name was not found in P-4,was found in the letter dated 30.01.2012 (P-S) and the

notice published after the interview was held (P-9), found in the 2nd place.

As observed by this court the said attendance sheet and the interview sheets produced before this court

had confirmed the presence of the i h Respondent along with another person by the name Nandawathy

Pathirathne whose name too was not appeared in P-4 along with the five Petitioners confirms the fact

that there was a genuine mistake by the officials at the Additional District Registrar's Office Gampaha

when preparing the document P 4.

The Petitioners, whilst relying only on P-4 had claimed legitimate expectation that one of them would

be selected as the Registrar of Birth, Death for Hendala Division and Registrar of Marriages (General)

for Southern Aluthkuru Korale Division, the attendance Register and the interview sheets produced

before us had created serious doubts of the above position taken by the Petitioners,

When considering the above documents along with the said position taken up by the Petitioners, it

appears that the Petitioners have deliberately suppresses the fact that the i h Respondent along with

another applicant by the name of Pathirathnage Nandawathy Pathirathne before this court. By

suppressing the said fact from this court, the Petitioners have presented a completely distorted version

before this court and in this regard this court is mindful of the decision in the case of Alponso

Appuhamy V. Hettiarachchi 1973 NLR 131 where the Pathirana J had observed,

"The necessity of a full and fair disclosure of all the material facts to be placed before the court when

an application for a writ or injunction is made and the process of the court is invoked is laid down in

the case of The King V. The General Commissioners for the purpose of the Income Tax Acts for the

District of Kensington-Ex-parte Princess Edmond de Poignac - (1917) Kings Bench Division 486.

Although this case deals with a writ of Prohibition the principles enunciated are applicable to all cases

of writs or injunctions. In this case a Divisional Court without dealing with the merits of the case

discharged the rule on the ground that the applicant had suppressed or misrepresented the facts

material to her application. The Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the Divisional Court that

there had been a suppression of material facts by the applicant in her affidavit and therefore it was

justified in refusing a writ of Prohibition without going into the merits of the case. In other words, so

rigorous is the necessity for a full and truthful disclosure of all material facts that the court would not

go into the merits ofthe application, but will dismiss it without further examination."

In their pleadings before this court the Petitioners have admitted the fact that they filed a Fundamental

Rights Application before the Supreme Court with regard to the same matter. As revealed before us,

the Petitioner did not go before the 4th Respondent to attend the inquiry with regard to the objections

filed by the Petitioners against the i h Respondent, since by that time they have filed the said

Fundamental Rights Application.

During the argument before us, in addition to the fact that there was a genuine mistake from part of the

officials attached to the office of the 2nd Respondent, the Respondent brought to our notice the

outcome of the said Fundamental Rights Application and argued that the Petitioners are estopped from

pursuing the present application since the Supreme Court had dismissed the said application.

With regard to the said argument placed before us, the Petitioners whilst relying on the decision by the

Supreme Court in the case of Stassen Exports Ltd V. Lipto to Ltd and Another SC (CHC)Appeai

51/2006 SC minute dated 19.11.2009 argued that the decision in the Fundamental Rights Application

was decided on two preliminary objections raised before the Supreme Court and therefore the Court of

Appeal is not estopped in deciding the case in hand on its merits.

In this regard we would first like to look into the decision by the Supreme Court in the case of Stassen

Export and in the said case Shirani Bandaranayake J (as she was then) observed,

"Accordingly the theory pronounced on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata is that if an action is

being brought and the merits of the matter had been decided by a Court with a final judgment being

delivered, such a question cannot be canvassed by the same parties in another action.

The doctrine of res judicata, had been accepted and applied in Sri Lanka, as far back as in 1847 by

Stark, J in Mendis V. Himmappooa (Ramanathan Reports (1843-1855) 88) well before the Civil

Procedure Code came into existence. Since then the doctrine had been considered in many judgments

(Cassim V. Mricar (1909) 12 NLR 184), Palaniappa Chetty V. Gomes (4 Balasingham Reports,

21), Herath V. The Attorney General (1958) 60 NLR 193, which was later amplified and statutorily

recognized in items of the Civil Procedure Code.

The constituent elements of res judicata estoppel is clearly described by Spencer Bower (The doctrine

of res judicata, Supra, pg.lO), where he has stated thus:

"A party setting up res judicata by way of estoppel as a bar to his opponent's claim, or as the

foundation of his own, must establish the constituent elements, namely:

1. The decision was judicial in the relevant sense;

ii. It was fact pronounced;

iii. The tribunal had jurisdiction over the parties and the subject matter;

IV. The decision was-

a) Final and

b) On the merits;

v. It determined the same question as that raised in the later litigation; and

vi. The parties to the later litigation were either parties to the earlier litigation or

their privies or the earlier decision was in rem" (emphasis added)

When considering the decision in the above case we have no reason to deviate and decide otherwise, if

the matter to be determined is the same question as that raised in the later litigation.

Whilst relying on the said decision, the Petitioners referred to page 5 of the judgment in SCFR

121/2012 to the effect,

"When this matter was taken up for hearing on i h December 2012 the Respondents raised two

preliminary objections on the maintainability of the application as follows;

1. That the Petitioners' application was out of time in terms of Article 126(2) of the Constitution

as the application of the Petitioners has not been filed within one month of the alleged

infringement

2. The Petitioners were guilty of suppression and misrepresentation of material facts, thereby

failing to act with uberrima fides ... "

and submitted that their Lordship when concluding the judgment had only referred to the said

preliminary objection and held,

"In view of the reasons discussed above hold the preliminary objections raised by the Respondents on

the basis that the Petitioners have failed to comply with the mandatory provisions contained in Article

126 (2) of the Constitution and on the ground that the Petitioners have misrepresented and suppressed

i.

J ! t f f (

material facts to court and failed to observe the doctrine of uberrima fides. I dismiss the application in

limine. No costs."

and argued that the Petitioners are not estopped by canvassing against the decision of the Respondents

since the Fundamental Rights Application was decided only on the two Preliminary Objections

referred to above.

However in this regard our attention was drawn to the following observation made by the Supreme

Court in the same judgment, at page 9 to the effect,

"On perusal of the written submission filed by the state it appears that in fact the Grama Niladhari 171

Kerawalapitiya and Grama Niladhari 171A Matagoda and the 7th Respondent had been present and

given written statements in response to the objection. (2R9a, 2R9b and 2R9c) After the inquiry it had

been found that the objections were baseless and were accordingly rejected. It has also been found that

the error by not including the name of the ih Respondent in the notice P-4 had been a bona-fide lapse

which was discovered only after the interview was conducted, on the part of the typist who was

assigned to prepare the notice. The court accordingly finds that no reasons are evident to justify the

challenge of the appointment of the i h Respondent."

In the said observation their Lordships have clearly disclosed their view with regard to the case before

them and therefore one cannot argue that the said observation is obiter. As observed by us, prior to the

said observation, their Lordships have discussed the merits of the case and thereafter only made the I

above observation.

Even though the matter was disposed on the preliminary objection, their Lordships have considered

t I

%-

the merits of this case and come to a conclusion that, "No reasons are evident to justify the challenge

of the appointment of the i h Respondent."

12

In the said circumstance it is clear that the question before us was also determined in the said

fundamental Rights Application and therefore we find that doctrine of res juducata estoppel is

applicable in the case in hand.

For the forgoing reasons we see no merit in the application before us and therefore we are not inclined

to grant any relief claimed by the Petitioners. This application is therefore dismissed, but we make no

order with regard to cost.

Application dismissed without cost.
