This is a revision application from the High Court of Colombo.

The Accused Petitioner was indicted in the High Court of Colombo

on for committing offences punishable under Poison Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance where he could be released on bail only on

exceptional circumstances under sec 83 (1) of the Ordinance. The

Petitioner made an oral application before the learned High Court Judge

for bail and was dismissed. This revision application is against the said

order of dismissal.

The learned Counsel's contention is that the learned High Court

Judge has determined that exceptional circumstances exists but has refused

bail. He argues that if the Court holds that the exceptional circumstances

exist, the Court has no alternative but to release the accused on bail.

, The learned High Court Judge in her order dated 12.09.2014 stated

that the accused has submitted that the long period of incarceration, the

illness of his wife ':and having two children as exceptional circumstances.

The learned High Court Judge has considered these factors and decided not

to grant bail. In h;er order she has stated "though the exceptional

circumstances were submitted" (~~ ~ ~~ ~). The Counsel for the

Petitioner argues that it means that the learned High Court Judge has

decided that the exceptional circumstances exist, but it really means that

certain facts have been submitted as exceptional circumstances and the

Court has considered them and come to the finding that the accused should

not be granted bail. Therefore, the argument that the Court has decided that

the exceptional circumstances exist, cannot stand.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the Petitioner

was in the remand custody for a long time. This fact alone cannot be

considered as an exceptional circumstance under the Ordinance because

3

intention of the Legislature is to keep a person accused or suspected of for

an offence of this nature in remand until the case is concluded unless no

exceptional circumstances to grant bail. Not having exceptional

circumstances for a certain period of time itself cannot be an exceptional

circumstance to grant bail. Another ground submitted is that the wife of the

Petitioner was a sick person. He submitted a Diagnosis Ticket issued by

the NHSL in 2013 marked as P 9. The patient was referred to the OPD

requesting to arrange a medical clinic to follow up. No document

submitted to establish that she is unable to take care of the children at the

time of making the application for bail.

The Petitioner having two children is not an exceptional ground to

consider bail.

The learned High Court Judge's decision not to grant bail is well

founded and I see no reason to interfere with.

The application dismissed.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

H.C.J.Madawala J.

I agree.
