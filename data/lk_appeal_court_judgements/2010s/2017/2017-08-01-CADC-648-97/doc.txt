S. DEVIKA DE LIVERA TENNEKOON J

The Plaintiff - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) instituted

action in the District Court of Mount Lavinia by her Plaint dated 03. 08.1995 to

partition the land in the Schedule to thereto amongst the 15t -8th Defendant -

Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants), the 9th Defendant

Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the 9th Defendant) and the Respondent.

The Appellants filed as joint statement of claim dated 30.09.1996 praying for inter

alia a dismissal of the Plaint and for their share of the corpus as prayed for therein.

The 9th Defendant claimed 1I3 rd of the corpus by statement of claim dated

4

30.09.1996. Trial commenced by a recording of three admissions and three issues

were raised on behalf of the Respondent and three issues were raised on behalf of

the Appellants on 24.04.1997.

Upon conclusion of the trial the learned District Court Judge pronounced judgment

dated 28.07.1997 in favour of the Respondent and held inter alia to partition the

corpus as per the shares described in the Plaint.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Appellants have preferred the instant

Appeal by Petition of Appeal dated 0309.1997 praying for inter alia to set aside

the order of the learned District Court Judge.

The main point of contention ~n this case is, as reflected by issue No.4, whether

the transferor of Deed bearing No. 733 dated 18.10.1979 one A.M. de Alwis, had

the proper mental capacity to execute the said deed. The Appellants contend that

the transferor did not have the required mental capacity to execute the said deed

and as such that the said deed is void.

Upon conclusion of the trial the leaned District Court Judge answered the above

issue affirmatively, and found that the said transferor was mentally fit at the time

of executing the said deed.

The main contention of the Appellant is that the learned District Judge has rejected

the application of the Appellants to lead medical evidence which amounts to a

denial of justice to the detriment of the Appellants. The Appellants therefore

submit that this case be remitted to the original Court for a trial de novo.

This contention must however fail as the Appellants have failed to appeal the order

of the learned District Judge which rejected the said application and the Appellants

have failed to pray to set aside the said order in their Petition of Appeal.

5

In any event it is clear that the Notary who executed the deed in question has stated

in evidence that the said transferor did possess the required mental capacity to

execute the said deed. The transferee of the said deed has also given evidence in

support of this position. However it is evident that the evidence presented at trial

on behalf of the Appellants have failed in consistency and further failed to prove

mental capacity or the lack thereof.

In the case of Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando 1993 [1] SLR 119 has held that "it was

well established that findings of primary facts by a trial judge who hears and sees

witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed in appeal."

The learned District Judge has carefully considered the material placed before him

at trial and come to the findings as articulated in his judgment dated 28.07.1998

and pronounced judgment in favour of the Respondents.

In the circumstances morefully discussed above, I see no reason to interfere with

the judgment dated 28.07.1997 of the learned District Judge of Mount Lavinia.

Appeal Dismissed.
