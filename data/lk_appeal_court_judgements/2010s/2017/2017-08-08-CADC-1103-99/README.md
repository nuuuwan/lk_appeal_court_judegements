M.M.A. GAFFOOR J

The plaintiff-appellant (hereinafter called and referred to as

the appellant) preferred the present appeal against the judgment of the

learned District Judge of Bandarawela in case bearing No: Lj 1088 dated

30.11.1999. When the matter was taken up for argument on

21.03.2017, having concluded the arguments the Court has directed to

both parties to tender their respective written submissions. The

appellant instituted action against the defendant-respondent (hereinafter

called and referred to as the respondent) pleading that she is the owner

of the land described in the schedule to the plaint and that the

respondent had commenced using a foot path through the said land in

dispute in spite of there being an alternative road leading to the

respondent's land as depicted in Plan marked' odtf.

The respondent filed answer denying the averments

contained in the plaint and pleaded that the said portion of land which is

purportedly used by the defendant as a roadway had been in existence

for a period of more than 10 years and hence the respondent has

acquired a prescriptive title to the said roadway and further pleaded that

the said roadway is required by her as an access to her block of land as a

way of necessity and prayed for dismissal of appellant's action.

2 J

When the trial commenced, 1 admission was recorded

between the parties whereas issues bearing No. 1-10 (vide proceedings

dated 15.02.1996 at page 54-57 of the brief) were raised by the petitioner

and issues bearing No.11-19 were raised by the respondent. At the trial,

evidence was led on behalf of both contesting parties in support of their

respective claims. On behalf of the Appellant, she herself, a retired

principle and the licensed surveyor gave evidence and closed her case

marking documents e%1 to e%6. On behalf of the respondent the

respondent herself and the licensed surveyor gave evidence marking

documents en to e>14. Thereafter, both parties tendered written

submissions and the learned District Judge delivered his judgment on

30.11.1999 in favour of the respondent. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment, the appellant preferred the present appeal to the Court of

Appeal seeking reliefs as prayed for in the prayer to the petition. The

appellant claimed ownership to the parcel of the land called 'Pasal Kanda

Watta' by virtue of state grant bearing No.Q)s;../~ 13250 dated 03.07.1991.

It is the complaint of the appellant that the respondent on or about July

1988 forcefully demarcated a foot path over the appellant's land to the

direction of east to south despite the right of way demarcated by the

Survey General along the eastern and southern boundaries of the

appellant's land. However, it was revealed during the course of the trial

that the respondent who claimed servitude right to a servient tenement

had claimed without having title to a dominant tenement. In view of the

3

pleadings, issues and evidence led and documents the following could be

considered as main issues pertaining to the present dispute.

a. Can the respondent on the materials placed before Court claim

right of way by prescription and/or by way of necessity for mere

convenience?

b. Can a person who has used indefinite ways of access to road

subsequently claim a right of way for a defined track over the

property of another?

c. When there is an alternative right of way can the respondent claim

way of necessity?

d. In the absence of title to the dominant tenement as at the date of

institution of action can the respondent claim a right of way over a

servient tenement?

Respondent claimed that they are using the said roadway from the year

of 1981 and therefore they have prescribed to the said right of way.

02.06.1988 - reverse page 90 of the brief)

According to the decided cases in order to obtain the prescriptive right to

another person's land andj or claim right of way the following ingredients

have to be proved by the person claiming the same.

i. undisturbed and uninterrupted possession by a title adverse

to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff,

ii. must be possessed by a person unaccompanied by payment

of rent or produce,

iii. a certain length of continuous possession (minimum of 10

years)

iv. Bona fide possession

v. Possession ut dominus

In the case of MitrapaZa and Another vs. Tikonis Singho (2005) 1 SLR

206:

(7) Mere possession is not prescriptive title. He must prove that he

had possessed the property in the manner and for the period set

out in section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

(8) Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 in order to

defeat the ownership of the adverse claimant to immovable

property the burden of proof rests squarely and fairly on him to

establish a starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive

rights.

5

In the case of De Silva vs. Commissioner General of Inland Revenue

80 NLR 292 Sharvananda J held;

"where a person who bases his title in adverse possession must

show by clear and unequivocal evidence that his possession was

hostile to the real owner and amounted to a denial of his title to

the property claimed"

In the case of Seeman vs. David (2000) 3 SLR 23 Weerasooriya J held;

"Person who entered property in a subordinate character cannot

claim prescriptive rights till he changes his character by an over

tact. The proof of adverse possession is a condition precedent to

the claim for prescriptive rights."

In the case of Kandiah vs. Seenitamby 17 NLR 29 it was held:

"A person who merely strays across an open land wherever it is

most convenient at any given point of time cannot thereby acquire

prescriptive right"

In the case of Comelis vs. Fernando 65 NLR 93 it was held:

"in the absence of a finding that the plaintiff established a right of

way by prescription over the intervening land, the court could not

grant the plaintiff a right of way through the defendant's land."

A careful perusal of defendant's evidence clearly shows that they

have been using indefinite footpaths over a long time of access the main

road. Vide page 87 of the brief.

(Defendant giving evidence - Vide page 103 of the brief)

H.W. Tambiah Q.C. in Principles of Ceylon Law at page 292, 293 has

held as follows:

"Where a footpath goes through several lands, it is very common in

the rural areas of Ceylon to have stiles along the footpath, in

places where such paths cross the lands. The presence of the

stiles do not in any way nullify the right of a dominant owner to

have a servitude of footpath over another man's land."

Further, in the case of Karunaratne vs. Gabriel Appuhamy 15 NLR

257 it was held:

"Mere straying over parts of land which was allowed for the

purpose of convenience is not sufficient to acquire a servitude by

prescription. "

It is manifest from decided cases that in regard to the prescription

of incorporeal rights, the claimant must establish a requirement not

specified in the provisions of the Prescription Ordinance namely, that the

adverse user of the rights must be exercised in relation to a particular

defined area of the corpus.

This view was first expressed in an unreported case in 1909 CR

Mallacam 16080 SC minutes of 26.01.1909 in Karunaratne vs. Gabriel

Appuhamy (1912) 15 NLR page 257 Lascelles CJ observed;

''In the system of law which prevails in Ceylon right of way are

acquired by user under the Prescription Ordinance, and the course

or track over which the right is acquired is necessarily strictly

defined."

In Kandiah vs. Seenitambi (1913) 17 NLR at page 29 the

plaintiff, who was the owner of a land, could only prove that he had

generally walked across the land of the defendant more than 10 years.

However, he could not establish user of a definite path. De Sampayo A.J.,

dismissing the plaintiffs claim, held that the adverse user, for the

purposes of prescription, must be in respect of a definite track. De

Sampayo A.J. endorsed the proposition laid down by Wendt J. in a

previous case that "The evidence to establish a prescriptive servitude of

way must be precise and definite. It must relate to a defined track, and

must not consist of proof of mere straying across an open land at any

point which is at the moment most convenient".

G.L. Peiris on The Law of Property in Sri Lanka Volume III Servitudes

and Partition, page 74.

The principle was reiterated in Fernando vs. Fernando (1929) 31

NLR page 126 Fisher C.J. (with Drieberg J. agreeing) said "User of a

definite track is the only way in which a right of way over the land of

8

another can be acquired by prescription." Similar views were expressed

by Wendt J in Andris vs. Manuel 2 S.C.D. 69 and by Howard C.J. in

Hendrick vs. Saranelis (1940) 17 C.L.W. 87, in Marasinghe vs.

Samarasinghe (1970) 73 N.L.R. 433 Alles J cited at page 449 the cases

of Kandiah vs. Seenitamby and Moragappa vs. Casie Chetty as

supporting the proposition that, in order to establish a servitude by

prescription, there should be a well defined track in existence.

It is the position of the appellant that the defendant has an

alternative route of access for her land granted by the state.

(Licensed Surveyor giving evidence. Vide page 80 of the brief)

Also in the case of Suppu Namasiwayam vs. Kanapathipillai et al

32 NLR 44 held:

"An owner of land, who by his own act deprives himself of access to

a road, is not entitled to claim a way of necessity to the road over

the land of another."

In the case of Chandrasiri vs. Wickramasinghe 70 NLR 15 at

page 17 held:

"The onus lies on a person who claims a right of way of necessity to

show that it is necessary for him to claim this right and when there

is an alternative convenient route he cannot make this claim."

However, it is an admitted fact that at the time of disputing

the appellant's right and even at the time of institution of these

proceedings the respondent had no title to the parcel of land claimed to

have been the dominant tenement. The respondent for the first time

answering a question posed by the appellant's Counsel divulged the fact

that her mother got title to the dominant land after 5 years of instituting

the action namely in the year 1998.

(Page 15 of the judgment. Vide page 136 of the brief)

By coming to such conclusion the learned trial judge has

deliberately over sighted the fact that rights of the parities to be

determined as at the date of the institution of action.

In VelupiZZai vs. Subasinghe (1956) 58 NLR 385 Basnayake

C.J. said:

"It would appear from this passage that a person who is entitled to

claim a way of necessity is the person who is the owner alone."

The competence to assert this claim is inextricably tied up with

ownership of a land or praedium.

The principle admits of no doubt that a servitude

cannot be granted by any other than the owner of a servient

tenement, nor acquired by any other than by the person who owns

the dominant tenement.

The attitude has been adopted by our courts that an

owner of land who by his own act, deprives himself of access to a

road, is not entitled to claim a way of necessity to the road over the

land of another."

In Suppa Namasivayam vs. Kanapathipillai (1930) 32

N.L.R. page 44 Maartensz A.J. declared:

"As regards the right of way of necessity, I am clearly of opinion

that the plaintiffs are not entitled to claim it. The plaintiffs

purchased the land to the south in 1917 and had access to the

11

road over this land to the south. They donated the land to the

south to their son just a year before the action was filed, and I

cannot avoid coming to the conclusion that the deed of gift was

executed with a view to claiming a way of necessity over the

defendants' land."

In a case of Talagune v. De Livera (1997) 1 SLR page 253 it

was held:

"There is no provision which permits a defendant to plead by way

of defence, matters arising subsequent to the institution of action,

the judgment must determine the rights of the parties as on the

date of the institution of action."

The position was affirmed in the recent case of Podi Nileme vs.

Shriyakanthi SC App 22/2013 decided on 17.01.2014.

A careful perusal of the judgment of the learned District

Judge indicates that he has failed to consider the totality of evidence in

reaching the judgment. The Judge has heavily relied on some

comments/remarks of evidence and thus has failed to analyse the impact

of the entire evidence. The learned District Judge's finding to the effect

that the respondent has possessed the right of way over 10 years was

erroneous. In deciding so the trial Judge has failed to address his

judicial mind to the balance of probabilities.

Further, the learned District Judge has decided in his judgment that the

appellant has not called any witness to prove that the right of way given

to the respondent by the Plan has difficulties of usage.

(Vide page 87 of the brief)

In view of the aforesaid submissions it is clear that the

learned District Judge has failed to consider totality of evidence in

deciding whether or not to grant servitude right over the appellant's land.

14

The learned District Judge has misdirected himself in deciding the law

and facts on above servitude and come to a wrong finding that the

respondent has having a servitude right over the appellant's land.

Therefore, I am of the opinion that the issues should have been answered

in the following manner.

a. No.

b. No.

c. No.

d. No.

Therefore I set aside the judgment of the learned District Judge and

according to the relief as prayed for in the petition, the appeal is allowed.

Appeal allowed.
