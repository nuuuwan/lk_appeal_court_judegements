S. Thurairaja, P.C, J.

We heard the submissions of the Counsel for the Accused-

Appellant and the learned D.S.G. for the Respondent. The Counsel

for the Accused-Appellant submits that he IS not contesting the

conviction and he is only making an application to consider

conceSSIOn on the sentence and he submits that the Accused-Appellant

is a 1 st offender and his age and other circumstances. The learned

D.S.G submits that the offence is a very serious offence as a public

servant and the learned trial Judge had considered all the

circumstances and given a minimum possible sentence. Therefore he

is objecting for any concession to be given to the Accused-Appellant.

Any how he submits that since the Accused-Appellant is behind the

, 2

bar from the date of conviction, he has no objections the sentence to

be implemented from the date of conviction.

Considering submissions, we find that the offence the

appellant it is a very committed is a serious offence, a public servant

working in a government department and having possession of forged

government documents namely, birth certificates and other things in

his possession and is a very serious matter to be considered.

Considering the facts and the submissions we affirm the conviction

and regarding the sentence the facts does not warrant any leniency

to be shown on the Accused-Appellant. Therefore, we affirm the

sentence also. Considering the age and the plea made by the learned

Counsel we direct the Prison Authorities to implement the sentence

from the date of conviction namely, 30.09.2014. Appeal dismissed.

Registrar is hereby directed to return the case record

to the Registrar of the High Court of Badulla for implementation of the

sentence.
