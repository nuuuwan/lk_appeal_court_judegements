The Plaintiff-Petitioner (sometimes hereinafter called "the Petitioner") has

preferred this application to this Court invoking Article 138 of the Constitution for

restitutio in integrum. The Counsel for the Defendant-Respondent (sometimes

herein after called "the Respondent") in his written submissions has quoted the

following definitions given to the term "Restitutio in Integrum".

"Restitutio in integrum ...... In the civil law, restoration or restitution to

the previous condition. This was effected by the praetor on equitable

grounds, at the prayer of an injured party, by rescinding or annulling a

contract or transaction valid by the strict law or annulling a change in the

legal condition produced by an omission, and restoring the parties to their

previous situation or legal relations. The restoration of a cause to its first

state, on petition of the party who was cast, in order to have a second

hearing ....... (Black's Law Dictionary 6th Edition page 1313)."

"Restitutio in integrum - The rescinding of a contract or contracts (e.g., on the

ground of fraud) so as to restore the parties to their original position." (Mozley &

Whiteley's Law Dictionary [12tb Edition] page 319) 2

"Restitutio in integrum - (Restoration to the original Position) "The remedy

administered by Courts of equity in rescinding a contract or otherwise placing

parties in the position they occupied before entering into a transaction." (P.G

Osborn's Law Dictionary 3rd Edition- page 279)

"Restituto in integrum - The rescinding of a contract or transaction so as to

place the parties to it in the same position with respect to one another which they

occupied before the contract was made or the transaction took place.

Fraud renders any transaction voidable at the option of the party defrauded: and

if, when it is avoided, nothing has occurred to alter the position of affairs, the

rights and remedies of the parties are the same as if it had been void from the

beginning. The party, exercising his option to rescind, is entitled to be restored, as

far as possible, to his former position. Such a restoration is restitutio in intergrum.

(Salgur Prasad v. Har Narain Dias 7 Luck 64 (PC): AIR 1932 PC 89). (K.J.

Aiyar's Judicial Dictionary 1988 10th Edition at pages 890 and 891)

"Restitutio in intergrum - Entire restitution; restoration to one's former

condition. A minor is entitled to entire restitution against all acts done by himself,

or others on his behalf, during his minority, which have been to his lesion. The

effect of such restitution is to place him in the same position quoad each particular

transaction as if it had never been entered into. This right must be judicially

claimed by the minor, by challenging the deed or transaction complained of before

the expiry of the quadriennium- the four years following his attaining majority-

otherwise his claim to restitution is barred. Where a contract is entered into under

essential error on the part of one or both contracting parties, the contract will be

set aside, but only on restitution in integrum being made, and the parties restored

to the same position in which they were before the contract was made. Thus, if the

contract was made for the sale of land, and on the faith of the contract being a

valid one the purchaser has proceeded to build upon or otherwise improve the

estate, the seller can only have the contract set aside and the lands restored to him

3

on making repayment to the purchaser the price paid by him, with interest thereon,

as well as of the whole sums expended by him on the improvement of the estate ... "

[Trayner's Latin Maxims 410 Edition at pages 558 and 552]

In his celebrated book on Law of Contract Dr. Weeramantry refers to the remedy

of Restitutio in integrum in the following manner;

"Ristitutio is however available not merely for the purpose of restoring

person under disability to the position they would have enjoyed had they not

entered in to the contract which is impugned It is also a general remedy

available for restoration of the status quo ante in all that wide range of

situations in which the law for one reason or another deems it proper to free

a party from the consequences of his contract. Remedy lies in cases of

mistake, fraud, undue influence and illegality have been discussed in some

detail in the respective chapters of this work dealing with these topics.

Two distinct senses must be noted in which the expression restitution in

integrum is used In the sense of Roman and Roman Dutch law it means a

type of action which may be called in aid by a party desiring to liberate

himself from a contract in to which he has entered In the sense in which the

term is sometimes used in English law it means however the effect which is

achieved by a decree of rescission of a contract.

In modern Roman Dutch practice, a claim for rescission and restitution on a

ground such as fraud, mistake or incapacity is described as restitutio in

integrum and there tends to be a blurring of the of the distinction between

the sense suggestive of a type of action and the sense suggestive of legal

consequences.

The remedy of restitution is also sought to liberate a party to a case from a

judicial decree affecting his rights which has been entered in consequence of

such vitiating circumstances as fraud or mistake. Such relief is granted on

4

grounds similar to those on which restitutio is granted in cases of contract.

Applications for such relief are not infrequent in Ceylon and are often

sought in combination with a prayer for revision of the decree

impugned. "(The Law of Contracts by C.G. Weeramantry -Volume 2 at

pages 1003 and 1004)

The aforementioned definitions and extracts without doubt indicates that the

discretionary remedy restitutio in integrum in general is wider in scope to

encompass private acts such as contractual relationships and judicial acts but at the

same time this Court has to take into consideration that this is not an action filed to

rescind or vitiate a contract or its outcome on grounds of mistake, fraud, minority

of a party etc. and to restore the parties to the same position that they were before

they entered in to the contract. No doubt that such an action has to be filed first in a

court of first instance. What is contemplated here is an application filed under

Article 138 of the Constitution. Therefore, it is necessary to consider whether this

application falls within the ambit of Article 138 of the Constitution. The relevant

part of the aforesaid Article 138 as amended by the 13th Amendment reads as

follows:

"138(1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate jurisdiction for the

correction of all errors in fact or law which shall be committed by the High

Court, in the exercise of its appellate or original jurisdiction or by any

Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive

cognizance, by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum, of all

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things of which such High

Court, Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution may have taken

cognizance"

A careful reading of the aforementioned Article 138 will show that it is a provision

brought to establish supervisory jurisdiction over the courts, tribunal and institution

5

below by way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum. It does not confer

jurisdiction over acts of individuals or group of individuals. Supervisory

jurisdiction created by this Article, including restitutio in integrum is to review

causes, suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things that have been taken

cognizance by a court or tribunal or institution below. Even in C.A. Case No.

02/2016, Rajapakse Mudiyanselage Karunaratne vs. Illuktenna Arachchilage

Piyasena, this Court has held as follows;

"A careful reading of the scope and ambit of restitution in integrum brings

out the fact that the exercise of this extraordinary jurisdiction extends to all

causes, suits actions, prosecutions, matters and things of which a court of

First instance, tribunal, or other institutions may have taken cognizance in

that there must be a court of first instance, tribunal or other institution

which must have heard in the first instance a cause, suit, prosecution,

matters and things, so to speak. It is the orders, judgments or whatever

description you may call it, that are made in the first instance, that become

susceptible to cognizance of this court in its exercise of restitutio in

integrum. "

It is my considered view that the sole and exclusive jurisdiction given to this Court

by the aforesaid Article does not contemplates all types of incidents or acts or

situations that call for the remedy of restitutio in integrum but only incidents or

acts or situations which are the outcome of judgments, decisions or steps of a court

or tribunal or institution below are involved.

In this backdrop, it is worth looking at the factual background stated in the petition

by the Petitioner in anticipation of a remedy in the nature of restitution of its

possession of the Labookellie Tea Center. Though the Petitioner has instituted an

action (No.SPL 176/2016) in the Nuwara Eliya District Court, it does not allege

any miscarriage of justice or error or harm caused by a decision or act of the

District Court of Nuwara Eliya. In fact, an enjoining order and extensions of it

6

f II

~i

.;

have been granted in Petitioner's favour. The Petitioner has not pinpointed any

order, step, decision or act of the said District Court which has to be reviewed or

considered under this application. The Petitioner's grievance is that it was

dispossessed of Labookellie Tea Center by the Respondent when two enjoining

orders were in force staying any interference to its possession. It is clear that the

enjoining orders were not served on the Respondent at the time of alleged eviction.

It is the position of the Petitioner that there was a collusive relationship between

the Respondent and one of its employees, namely Dileep Vedanayagam who has

changed its allegiance to the new management. The Petitioner states that CEO of

the aforesaid Tea Center verbally informed said Dileep Vedanayagam that the

enjoining order is in operation but acting in violation of the enjoining order Dileep

Vedanayagam verbally abused the said CEO and prevented him from discharging

his duties. The Petitioner further states that the Respondent while having

cognizance of the said enjoining orders surreptitiously issued the termination of

lease agreement letter indicating the date as 30th November 2016 which was in fact

posted on 3rd December 2016. It should be noted that the enjoining orders were

supported and issued on 1 st of December 2016 which is one day after the date of

the termination letter.

Since there is no enjoining order against Dileep Vedanayagam and he is an

employee of the Petitioner, Petitioner's statement that he acted in violation of the

enjoining orders is not acceptable. On the other hand, whether he had any collusive

relationship with the Respondent is a fact that has to be more suitably established

fIrst in a court of first instance after full trial. In the same manner whether the

Respondent surreptitiously back dated and issued the termination of lease

agreement letter or the Petitioner fIled the action and supported the application for

enjoining orders in the District Court after coming to know that a decision had

been taken by the Respondent to terminate the lease agreement in a lawful manner

is also a fact that has to be more suitably established first in a court of first instance

after full trial.

I also observe even though P8a has been tendered as proof of lease rental

payments, the contents of it reads with the conditions relating to the rental

payments of the lease agreement P5 suggests that there would have been a

considerable default of payment till the payment referred in P8a is done. This

shows even the validity of termination of the lease agreement is a fact that has to

be properly evaluated after a full trial in a court of first instance. It shall be also

noted that there are provisions in P5 that enables the Respondent to take over the

possession when there is a default.

Whatever the truthfulness of the stance taken by the Petitioner, it is clear that

alleged acts of eviction and termination of lease are not the outcome of an order,

decision or a step taken by the District Court of Nuwara Eliya but acts of the

Respondent. As discussed before in this judgment those acts or their consequences

do not fall within the ambit of Article 138.

The Petitioner argues that he has no other remedy but if the Respondent took

possession to defeat the court order while knowing the existence of an enjoining

order prohibiting such an act it could be dealt with for contempt of court. (see

Ganamuttu vs. Chairman Urban Council Bandarawela 43 N.L.R 366) It seems

that the Petitioner has already resorted to this remedy (vide paragraphs 21 and 22

of the petition and PI8). On the other hand, if the acts of eviction of the Petitioner

and taking of possession are in breach of the legal obligation the Respondent had

towards the Petitioner, the Petitioner can resort to a legal action based on the new

cause of action that took place after filing the DC Nuwara Eliya Case No.

SPL176/2016.

It is also observed that reliefs prayed in prayer 'b', 'c' and 'd' of the petition are

declarations based on the documents P6, P5 and PI3.Those are basically reliefs

that can be granted after full trial by a court of first instance and cannot be fall

within the ambit of Article 138 of the Constitution to be considered by this Court

in the first instance in an application for restitutio in integrum. Though reliefs

8

prayed in prayer 'e' and 'd' of the petition contemplates the restoration of

possession, as mentioned before, if any eviction has taken place it is not the result

of an act or step of a court or tribunal or institution below. Therefore, my

considered view is that the main reliefs prayed in the petition do not fall within the

ambit of jurisdiction given to this Court for restitutio in integrum by the Article

138 of the Constitution.

Therefore, this Court declines to issue notice in the first instance and the

application for restitutio in integrum is dismissed forthwith.
