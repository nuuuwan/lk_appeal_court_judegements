P.R. Walgama, J

The appellant IS before this court, aggrieved by the

judgment dated 31.03.2014 delivered by the Learned High

Court Judge of Gampaha. The Accused - Appellant was

charged for murdering his wife by strangulating with a

wire. The Learned High Court Judge after evaluating the

evidence in the correct perspective, convicted the Accused-

Appellant for murder and imposed a death sentence

accordingly. It is against the said conviction and sentence

the Accused - Appellant has appealed to this court to

have the conviction and sentence set aside.

The story of the prosecution In respect of the alleged

murder un spools the following;

That on this fateful day the Accused - Appellant had

strangled the deceased (his wife) to death. The said dreadful

incident was witnessed by their son Dilan Athukoralage,

and incidents thereafter were witnessed by the father of

the Accused - Appellant and another neighbour namely

Pabawathi.

It is to be noted that the mrun ground of appeal has

been that the Learned Trial Judge has acted purely on

the evidence of the son who made a statement to the

police only after one and half years later. The said

contention has to be considered In the perspective of

the facts of this case. It was transpired in the course

of the trial that the above witness was living with his

grand mother, after his mother was killed. Therefore it is

the position of the counsel for the Accused - Appellant

that the said witness would have been tutored by the

grand mother.

Regarding the second Issue raised as a ground of appeal

is that the evidence of the above witness is contrary to

the medical evidence. The said position has been resolved

by the Supreme Court of India In a recent judgment

dated 07.03.2017 In the case of MOHAN RAI .VS. STATE

OF UTTRA PREDESH wherein it has been held that "where

the expert evidence is obscure and oscillating it is not

proper to discredit the testimony of the eye witness on

such uncertain evidence." It was further held even

although there are contradictions In the ballistics and

medical reports if there IS reliable ocular evidence the

court should act upon such evidence.

It was the testimony of the said witness that he saw

the father the Accused - Appellant assaulting the mother

the deceased with the wire, which production was marked

as PI and was identified by this witness at the trial.

Further he has also vouched to the fact that after the

deceased fell on the ground the Accused - Appellant had

hung her by a cloth, which was produced at the trial

and marked as P2, and the same was identified by this

witness. It was the evidence of Pabawathi that she rushed

to the house of the Accused - Appellant and found the

father of the Accused - Appellant holding the deceased legs

and screaming for help to cut the cloth. The said ligature

was cut by her son Gamage Ananda. It was the position

of the Accused - Appellant that the deceased had on a

previous occasion attempted to commit suicide by drinking

poison. But this fact was never proved.

The counsel for the Respondent had adverted court to

the medical report which has given a vivid description of

the injuries, where it has been observed some abrasions

in the neck caused by nails, and linear contusions caused

by a thin rope. Further it was the observation of the

5 I

I I 1

JMO that the cause of death was due to a squeezing

the neck by hand and by a thin code on the neck.

It was transpired at the trial that there had been

constant quarrels and the relationship between the

deceased and the Accused - Appellant was acrimonious and

inimical and as such the prosecution has established

motive for the alleged murder.

Therefore in the light of this cogent evidence court see

no reason to interfere with the conviction and the

sentence.

Accordingly we affirm the conviction and sentence and

dismiss the appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.
