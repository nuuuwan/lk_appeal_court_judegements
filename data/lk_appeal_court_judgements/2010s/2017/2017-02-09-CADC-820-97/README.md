This is a rei-vindicatio action filled by the Plaintiff-respondent

In the District Court of Kurunagalle against the Defendant-

Appellant seeking for following relief inter alia;

the premises which was described in the schedule to the

plaint.

ii) For ejectment of the Appellant and all those holding

under her from the said premises.

iii) Damages of Rs.10,000 per month from 30.12.1990

till the respondent receival of the possession of the

same.

In a rei-vindicatio action the cause of action is based on the

sole ground of violation of right of ownership to the land. In a rei-

vindicatio action the plaintiff claims as the owner of the land he has

the dominum and that land is in the unlawful possession of the

defendant.

In the case of Peeris Vs. Savunhamy- S.C.121-19S1- 64 NLR

page 207 Dias S.PJ. Held:

"Where in an action for declaration of title to land, the

defendant is in possession of the land in dispute the burden is on

the plaintiff to prove that he has dominium.

, .

In the case of D.A. Wanigarathne and Juwanis 65 N.L.R. 167

stated" in an action rei- vindication the plaintiff must prove and

establish his title. He cannot ask for a declaration of tile in his

favour merely on the strength that the defendant's title in poor or

not establish.

In this matter plaintiff respondent state in his plaint inter alia

that the premises was belonged to Thambi Marikkar Hadjiyar Sara

Umma, Ibrahim Nina Marikkar Umma, and Ibrahim Naina Markkar

Mohamed Casim Marikkar. The said co-owners execute the Deed

bearing No.3886 dated 19.05.1960 executed by S.M.Abuthahir NP

and thereby exchanged their rights to Iabrahim Nina Marikkar

Raliya Umma became the sole owner of the said premises. This

Raliya Umma by deed No.1981 dated 30.12.1990 attested by

Wasantha Amarasakera NP transferred her rights to the respondent

and respondent became the lawful owner of the said premises. This

was an admitted fact and the plaintiff proved his title which marked

as P 1. In these circumstances the ownership of the plaintiff as from

30th December 1990 is an admitted fact.

,.

The Plaintifrs action is for the declaration of title alleging that

the defendant was disputing his rights as the owner. In such case

when the title is admitted the burden is on the defendant to

establish the legality of her possession.

In the case of Gunasekara & another V. Latif! 1999 1 SLR 365

stated " Ordinarily the plaintiff has the right to begin , but

where the defendant admits plaintifrs story and contends on

some point of law or additional facts to be alleged by him that

the plaintiff is not titled to any part of the relief he claims, the

defendant has the right to begin.

However the defendant-appellant in this matter has taken up

the position that she was not aware that the ownership of the

premises was transferred to plaintiff and failed to prove that she is

in possession as a tenant.

In the case of Jayawardena Vs. Wanigasekara & others 1985

1 SLR page 125, states to prove tenancy the best evidence is the

, .

payment of rent and the rent receipts. But it is clear that the

Defendant-Appellant failed to produce any such documents to

prove that she is in possession as a tenant.

In these circumstances, I am of the VIew that the learned

District Judge has very carefully and correctly analyzed all the

verbal and documentary evidence placed before him come to his

conclusion.

For the afore stated reasons, I dismiss the appeal with costs

ftxed as Rs. 25,000/-.
