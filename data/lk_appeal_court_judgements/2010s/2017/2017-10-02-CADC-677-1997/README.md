This appeal has arisen from the judgment of the learned

District Judge of Kegalle in respect of a partition action

No.23209 jP, wherein the learned District Judge had held with

the Defendant-Appellant, that he had not prescribed Lot 1 of Plan

bearing No.920 dated 15.11.1982 of T.M.T.B. Tennakoon,

Licensed Surveyor.

The facts germane to the issue are whether the said

Defendant-Appellant had prescribed the said Lot 1 in terms of

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

It is trite law that in order to invoke the Provisions of

Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance 2 of 1889. The claimant

has to establish the following ingredients.

1. Undisturbed and uninterrupted possession.

2. Such Possession to be independent or adverse to

the claimant plaintiff and

3. Ten years previous to the bringing of such action

In Leisa and other Vs. Simon and others 2002 1SLR

148 Justice Vigneswaran had clearly stated that long period

possession alone could not establish any prescriptive title to the

land.

"Possession and occupation must be distinguished ....

The long period of occupation would not make it an

adverse possession unless there had been an over act

of ouster as in the case of prescription among co-

owners. The learned Judge also seems to have

3

\

overlooked the difference between long occupation as

a licensee and adverse possession".

Also in Siriyawathie and Alwis and others 2002 2 SLR

Justice Dissnayake J had discussed as to what amount to as an

over act. In doing so, he held that the appellant's had prescribed

to the land.

We have taken into consideration of the cases referred to us

In Tilakaratne Vs. Bastain 21 NLR 12, Wickremaratne Vs.

Perera 1986 1 SLR 190.

In Simpson Vs. Omeru Lebbe 48 NLR 112, Soertsz SPJ,

& Jayethileke, J.

(( As between co-owners separate posseSSIon on

grounds of convenience cannot be regarded as

adverse possession for the purpose of establishing

prescriptive title".

In Abdul Majeed Vs. Umma Zaneera 61 NLR 361 Court took

up the view that long continued possession of the property owned

in common is not sufficient to draw an assumption of ouster. It

is relevant to consider matter such as

a. Income derived from the property.

b. The value of the property.

c. The relationship of the co-owners and where they reside in

relation to the situation of the property.

d. Document executed on the basis of exclusive possession.

In Maria Fernando & Others V. Anthony Fernando

(1997) 2 SLR 356 Court of Appeal held that:

" Long possession, payment of rates and taxes,

enjoyment of produce, filling suit without making

the adverse party a party, preparing plan and

building house on land renting it are not enough

to establish prescription among co -owners in

the absence of an over act of ouster. A secret

intention to prescribe may not amount to

ouster".

Regarding buildings claimed under prescription it is submitted

that the buildings claimed by the Defendant- Respondent, had been

built the said structure after the institution of the partition action,

and this issue had not been contested by the said Defendant-

Respondent.

In Dias Abeysinghe Vs. Dias Abeysinghe & Two Others 34

CLW 69 (SC) Keuneman SPJ., & Canakaratne, J. Held that:

''That, where a co-owner erects a new building on

the common land and remains in possession thereof

for over ten years, he does not acquire a prescriptive

right to the building and the soil on which it stands

as against the other co-owners merely by such

possession" .

We note that in the case of Sirajudeen and Two Others V.

Abbas (1994) 2 SLR 365 the Supreme Court has observed

thus:

"As regards to the mode of proof of prescriptive

possession, mere general statements of witnesses

that the plaintiff possessed the land in dispute for

a number of years exceeding the prescriptive

period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and

adverse possession necessary to support a title by

prescription, it is necessary that the witnesses

should speak to specific facts and the question of

possession has to be decided thereupon by Court".

"One of the essential elements of the plea of

prescriptive title as provided for in Section 3 of

the Prescription Ordinance is proof of possession

by a title adverse to or independent of that of the

claimant or plaintiff. The occupation of the

premIses must be of such character as IS

incompatible with the tile of the owner".

We have perused the evidence adduced by the

said Defendant-Appellant in claiming the said prescriptive

title, and see no valid reason to interfere with this

considered judgment.

Appeal dismissed with costs ftxed at Rs.25000j=.
