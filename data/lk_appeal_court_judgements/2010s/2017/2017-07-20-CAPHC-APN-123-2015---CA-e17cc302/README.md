Learned Counsel for both parties agreed that both cases

namely, C.A.(PHC) APN No.123/2015 and C.A.PHC No.

94/2015 be taken up for hearing together as it relates to the

same Issue. They also concur that it would suffice for this

Court to pronounce one order in respect of both the above

cases. Hence this order must apply to both the above cases.

The order originally impugned by the 1st accused-

petitioner-petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the accused-

petitioner) is an order made by the learned Magistrate

refusing to permit the accused-petitioner to bring in evidence

pertaining to a production of a CD on his behalf. The learned

Magistrate has refused the said application on the basis that

expected evidence coming from that CD would not be relevant

4

to the case before him as the event that was expected to be

proved by the accused-petitioner is an event that had taken

place in the year 2011. This assumes an importance because

the date of offence mentioned in the charge against the

accused-petitioner is a date in the year 2009.

Learned Magistrate had made this order on 2014.08.01.

Being aggrieved by that order the accused -petitioner

had moved the High Court through a revision application filed

by him. The High Court in its order dated 2015.08.13 had

refused the application for revision inter alia on the basis

that there were no exceptional circumstances.

During the course of argument learned Deputy Solicitor

General agreed that it would be better to allow the learned

Magistrate to record the evidence of the accused-petitioner

and then let the learned Magistrate to decide at that stage, if

-,'J need arises, whether this application should be allowed.

5

This Court is also of the view that it would be the best

time to decide the relevancy or otherwise of the contents of

the CD, i.e. after the evidence of the accused-petitioner is

recorded. This is particularly so in view of the submissions

of the learned Counsel for the accused-petitioner that what

he seeks by the production of CD would be to corroborate

the testimony of the accused-petitioner in Court. This fact in

our view depend on the nature of the evidence in chief of the

accused-petitioner and subsequent line of cross-examination

that would be adopted by the prosecution at the trial. It may

well be that the need to produce this CD might not arise at all.

But if indeed such a need arises, at that stage, learned

Magistrate would be in a better position to decide on this

Issue.

In view of this submission we proceed to set aside the

learned High Court Judge's order dated 2015.08.13 as well as

the order made by the learned Magistrate dated 2014.01. 08.

6

Learned Counsel for both parties agreed to permit the

accused-petitioner's evidence to be recorded if the accused-

petitioner desires to give evidence. Learned Counsel for both

parties also agreed that the learned Magistrate should

decide on the question of relevancy of the contents of the CD,

after permitting the accused -petitioner to produce the

contents of the CD.

This Court directs the learned Magistrate to facilitate the

above process.
