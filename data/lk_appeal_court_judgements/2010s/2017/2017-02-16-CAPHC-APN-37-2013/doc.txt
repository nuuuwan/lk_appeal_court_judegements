The 2nd Respondent Respondent (the 2nd Respondent) presented an

application to the 1 st Respondent Respondent (the 15t Respondent) seeking

permission to demolish the building where the Petitioner Petitioner (the

Petitioner) was occupying as the tent and to redevelop the building under

section 18A of the Rent Act as amended. After hearing both parties, the

1 st Respondent made order allowing the application subject to depositing

Rs. 443,5001= as 20% of the market value at the time of the application

and Rs. 3,696/= as the rent for two years aggregating to a sum of Rs.

532,2001= to be withdrawn by the Petitioner as compensation.

Being dissatisfied with the order, the Petitioner filed an application

for a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari in the High Court of

Kandy. The learned High Court Judge after hearing both parties

dismissed the application. This revision application is against the said

order.

The 2nd Respondent raised preliminary objections to this

application on the basis that there is an unexplained delay and no

3

exceptional circumstances. Further in his objection he submitted that the

Petitioner has not disclosed all material facts.

The petitioner's application for a writ of certiorari in the High

Court Kandy was dismissed on 13.07.2012. The Petitioner filed notice of

appeal 26.07.2012 but did not file the petition of appeal and not

prosecuted the appeal. Since the 2nd Respondent has deposited the money

with the 1 st Respondent to be paid to the Petitioner and was informed by

the 1 st Respondent to vacate the premises but being failed to do so, the 2nd

Respondent filed action in the District Court to eject the Petitioner. The

order nisi was served on the Petitioner and on 20.02 2013 he appeared in

the District Court and obtained a date to file objections. This revision

application was filed on 21.03.2013.

From the date of the order of the High Court, there is a delay of 09

months in filing this revision application. The Petitioner's explanation for

the delay is that he has fallen ill. He tendered a medical certificate marked

AS issued by Dr. Kamal Abdul Naser MBBS, MD, MRCP(UK),

MRCPS(Glasg) Consultant Physician of Peradeniya Teaching Hospital

that the Petitioner has showed features of depression and he improved

with antidepressants. The Doctor's opinion is that the Petitioner could not

have attended to his normal duties due to the illness during the period

from i h August till mid September 2012. This explains the delay till mid

September, but there is a further delay of about 6 months without any

explanation. The Petitioner knowing that he could not proceeded the

appeal, he should have taken prompt action to institute the revision

application but has neglected to do so. The only conclusion that the Court

can come in to is that the Petitioner rouse from his deep sleep after

serving the order nisi in the case filed against for ejectment and filed this

revision application. Inordinate delay is fatal for a revision application. H.

A. M. Cassim v. Government Agent Batticaloa 69 NLR 403 is an

application in revision filed on 29th July, 1966 to revise the order made

by the Magistrate on the 20th April, 1964. It has been held in this case

that the applications of this nature must be made promptly if they are to

be entertained by this Court. It must fail for that reason alone.

The Petitioner's main argument is that the plan presented to the 15t

Respondent by the 2nd Respondent in the application under section 18A is

not for a new construction but only for an alteration and therefore the 15t

Respondent should not have allowed the application. This objection has

been taken before the 15t Respondent at the inquiry and after hearing both

parties on the issue, the 15t Respondent has come to the conclusion that

even though the heading of the plan marked ~8 is "alteration", it is for a

redevelopment. This decision contains in the document marked 2Rl filed

with the objections of the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner has not

disclosed the fact that the 15t Respondent has inquired in to the issue of

the heading of the plan and made the decision on it. The 15t Respondent

had offered a hearing to both parties before coming to this conclusion.

She has acted within the law.

The heading of the plan is not the material point; it is the content of

it. The plan shows that how to construct the foundation, the columns, and

the concrete slabs etc. The first item of the attached estimate to the plan is

the cost of demolition of the existing brick wall. The demolition of the

existing walls and constructing from the foundation is a redevelopment.

The decision of the 15t Respondent that the plan marked ~8 is for a

redevelopment is well considered correct decision.

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner made a lengthy submission

that the learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the written

submissions of the Petitioner because the Registrar of the High Court has

not filed the written submissions in to the file of record due to not

tendering a motion with the written submissions. Tendering written

submissions without a motion is not sufficient. There must be an

application by way of a motion to file the written submissions in to the

file of record. Without that application the document tendered will be

filed in a common file. The negligence of the Counsel should not be

directed towards the Registrar of the Court.

It has been held in the case of M. A. Don Lewis, v. D. W. S.

Dissanayake and others 70 NLR 8 where the application to intervene was

dismissed by the District Court the petitioner did nothing for 8 months

"that it was not the function of the Supreme Court, in the exercise of the

jurisdiction now invoked, to relieve parties of the consequences of their

own folly, negligence and laches. The maxim vigilantibus, non

dorm ientib us, jura subvention provided a sufficient answer to the

petitioner's application. Further, the petitioner did not display the

honesty and frankness expected of a person seeking the extraordinary

powers of the Court. "

Under these circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the

finding of the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly I dismiss the application subject to costs fixed at Rs.
