The instant appeal relates to a partition action instituted by the 1 st - 5th Original

Plaintiffs against the original Defendants to partition a land called

"Kahatagahawatta" as provided for in the Schedule to the Plaint.

On 10.03.1993 trial commenced and issues and admissions were framed by the

parties. In the meantime the 5th Defendant was substituted in room of the 5th

Plaintiff and the 5th Plaintiff was made the 1 oth Defendant (the Appellant) in this

case. The Parties informed Court that this case could be settled.

The Appellant in this case was not present on numerous Court dates and Court

therefore moved on the basis 'that she has abandoned her rights. Thereafter the

Appellant filed Petition and Affidavit to purge her default and produced medical

certificates marked as PI and P2 respectively. Consequent to the parties filing

written submissions on this issue the learned District Court Judge delivered order

on 24.11.1998 rejecting the application of the Appellant on the basis inter alia that

the medical certificates were not duly proved since what was produced was only a

photocopy and not produced as a true copy of the original and further that the

Appellant has not been vigilant to substitute another in the room of the Appellant.

Thereafter the learned District Judge delivered Judgment in the main issue on

30.12.1998.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment the Appellant has preferred the instant

Appeal to inter alia set aside judgment delivered on 30.12.1998 and the

interlocutory decree, order de novo trial and to permit the Appellant to participate

in the trial and produce her title deeds.

The Respondent in this case raises a preliminary objection that the Appellant in

this case is a defaulting party under Section 25(2) of the Partition Act and as such

that she cannot appeal the main judgment dated 30.12.1998 as at the time of

delivery of the judgment she was a defaulting party.

Section 25(2) of the Partition Act reads;

If a defendant shall fail to file a statement of claim on the due date the trial

may proceed ex parte as against such party in default, who shall not be

entitled, without the leave of court, to raise any contest or dispute the claim

of any other party to the action at the trial.

The Respondent contends that, a defaulting party has no right to appeal the final

judgment in the case and further that in any event that the Appellant has not prayed

to set aside the order of the learned District Judge refusing the application to purge

the default of the Appellant.

At the outset it is clear that the Appellant has not taken any steps to either Appeal

and / or revise the order of the learned District Judge dated 24.11.1998 rejecting

the application of the Appellant to purge her default. Upon perusal of the Petition

of Appeal dated 24.02.l999 it is clear that the Appellant has also failed to give

reasons as to why the said order was not challenged and further there is no prayer

to set aside the said order.

The Appellant further contends that the Settlement reached between the parties in

this case is to the detriment of the Appellants interests and that such settlement was

reached in collusion between the parties and fraudulently. However this Court

finds that the Appellant has not placed sufficient material before Court to make a

determination on this ground and in any event the Appellant has not invoked the

powers of Court in this regard.

Under these circumstances this Court is of the view that the Appellant has not

taken the correct steps to remedy her default and has circumvented procedure by

challenging the final judgment and not the aforesaid order. As such the preliminary

objection raised by the Respondent is upheld and this Appeal is dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
