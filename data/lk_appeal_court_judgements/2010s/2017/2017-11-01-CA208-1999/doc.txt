The defendant-appellant had lodged the instant appeal and

challenged the legality of the judgment dated 26.02.1999.

As per judgment stated above the learned District Judge

entered a judgment in favour of the plaintiff and decreed accordingly.

The plaintiff-respondent instituted action in the District Court

of Bandarawela in the case bearing No.199 /L to eject the defendant from

the land described morefully in the schedule thereto.

It was the position of the plaintiff that the Ceylon Railway

Department had leased the subject land described in the schedule; which

is morefully depicted in Plan bearing No.8324 made by the Railway

Surveyor S.R.A. Jayasinghe containing in extent A-O - R-O P-6. As per

documents marked P5, P6 and P7, it is evident that the Railway

Department had renewed the Lease Agreement time to time.

It is alleged by the plaintiff that the defendant had forcibly

entered the subject land and had started to remove the earth to construct

a building. In addition the earth that was removed from the said land was

dumped on the adjoining land which belongs to the plaintiff.

In the aforesaid circumstances the plaintiff moved for

injunctive relief, by way of an interim injunction to restrain the defendant

from proceeding with the construction. It is seen from the proceedings an

interim injunction was issued at the very first instant itself. Therefore it

is alleged by the defendant the said procedure was obnoxious to the

provisions of the Civil Procedure Code namely, Section 664 (1). But it is

worthy to mention that said procedure was allowed prior to the Civil

Procedure Code Amendment Act No.79 of 1988. The said impugned order

has been made on 16.11.1978, and I see no merit in the above contention

of the defendant.

Therefore the plaintiff has moved Court to recognize and

confirm this right to possess the said land and an ejectment of the

defendant from the land in issue.

In response to the above claim of the plaintiff, the defendant

by way of his answer had taken up the position that the plaintiff cannot

maintain the above action as there was a settlement between the

defendant and the plaintiff. Further, it is said that by the above settlement

the dispute was settled and concluded.

As the above issue was raised by the defendant the learned

District Judge by his order dated 25.03.1991 had overruled the

defendant's objection and fixed the case for trial. Therefore, the learned

trial Judge was of the view that both parties did not intend to give effect to

the so called settlement.

According to the above settlement the parties had agreed to

issue a commission to the Railway Surveyor and accordingly same had

been issued along with the Plan L 8324 dated 04.05.1968 as referred to

the plaint, and Plan BP 0254 which depicts the land claimed by the

defendant.

As per commission the Railway Surveyor made the Plan No.

BP 0884 and the Report dated 07.05.1979 which are marked as Y and YI.

It is confirmed from the said Plain that Lot NO.2 and 3

comprises the land belonging to the plaintiff as per Plan No. L 8324 dated

4

I

I i i I I I ! ! I ! I . I I

I I ! i I I ! I ! ! , i ! I I .

04.05.1968. It is clear from the Surveyor's Report that the Lot 2 depicted

in Plan No.0884 is a part of the plaintiffs land. Therefore, as a matter of

settlement the Surveyor has suggested to allocate Lot No.4 to the plaintiff

which was rejected by the plaintiff. Therefore, it is abundantly clear that

there had never been a settlement, but had explored a possibility of such

a course. Therefore, it is crystal clear that the defendant had encroached

upon the land in issue which belongs to the plaintiff. Hence it is apparent

that there had not been a settlement proper and the defendant is not

entitled to make such a claim and be successful in the battle. As such I

see no merits in the contention of the defendant and same should stand

rejected.

The Court issued a commission to Surveyor Mohamed Ismail

and consequently Plan No.3885 marked X and the Report marked Xl was

tendered to Court.

It is important to note as per Report marked Xl, the defendant

had not produced his Plan to the Surveyor. It was the observation of the

Surveyor that Lot 2 in Plan NO. L 8324 belongs to the plaintiff and was

leased out by the Railway Department and Lots 2 and 3 in Plan Y clearly

falls within Lot 2 in Plan No. L 8324 and same is now depicted as Lots 2A

and 2B in Plan No. 3885. Further, it is clear from the said Plan No. 3885

Lot lB is a private land belonging to the plaintiff.

According to the Plain marked X the building of the defendant

stands on the Lot 2B which is a portion of the Lot 2 in Plan P3 and

obviously on the land belonging to the plaintiff.

Further, this Court will take cognizance of the fact, that as per

Plan marked X the alleged building of the defendant apparently stands on

Lot IB which is a private land of the plaintiff. Therefore, it is a well

established fact that the defendant had built the building concerned on

the land belonging to the plaintiff, despite the opposition and while the

interim injunction was in force.

It was the categorical position of the plaintiff that the

defendant construct an illegal construction, while the interim injunction

was in force; and the plaintiff has made a complaint to the police on

11.04.1979 regarding the same.

It is salient to note that the defendant did not adduce any

evidence at the trial. The Surveyor of the Railway Department gave

evidence, which in fact strengthened the case of the plaintiff.

In the course of his testimony to Court he admitted that as

per Plan X the defendant's building had encroached on the plaintiffs

private land. It also transpired that the Plan marked P3 was prepared by

him in 1969 and had also admitted that Lot 2B in Plan X is a portion that

was leased to the plaintiff.

At this stage this Court will take serious note of the fact, that

although the defendant's version was that the Railway Department had

leased out the land in issue to him no document has been tendered to

prove the same and as such the defendant has failed to establish the said

position, to the satisfaction of Court.

It is abundantly clear that the learned District Judge has

analyzed the above facts in the correct perspective, as such I see no reason

to interfere to make a different determination.

The learned District Judge has also considered the fact, that

the defendant has cut the earth and dumped to the plaintiffs private land

on the strength of the evidence of the Surveyor who produced the

documents marked X and Xl.

The learned District Judge has also considered the fact that

an illegal construction by the defendant is within the land in issue as per

testimony of the two Surveyors.

The defendant had raised issues at the trial to the effect that

the plaintiff has not, by way of a plan shown the area that was encroached

by the defendant. In answering those issues, pertaining to the above, the

learned District Judge had formed the view at the time the plaintiff was

giving evidence, the said portion of land allegedly encroached by the

defendant was established by the aforesaid plans.

In the said background this Court see no reason to uphold the

argument of the defendant.

For the reasons as stated above this Court comes to the

irresistible conclusion, that the impugned judgment is well considered of

overwhelming evidence of the plaintiff.

Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal.

Appeal is dismissed subject to a cost of Rs.I0,OOOj-.
