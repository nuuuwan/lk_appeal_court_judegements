The suspect, Thajudeen Thajul Muneer has been remanded by the

Magistrate under the Vicitims and Witness Protection Act for assaulting and

intimidation of a victim. Learned Counsel for the petitioner informs Court that

this matter has been settled outside Court and that the complaint against the

suspect has been withdrawn. Learned Senior State Counsel concedes the fact

and she is not objecting to bail.

Since the matter has been settled among the parties outside

Court and the State is not objecting to bail, we decide to grant bail on the

following conditions :-

(1) The suspect is enlarged on cash bail in a sum of

Rs.25,000 / = (Twenty Five Thousand Rupees) with two

so this bail order will be cancelled ..

to the petitioner on payment of usual charges.
