JUDGMENT

P Pad man Surasena 1

Petitioners were appointed as Librarians. The grades to which they were

appointed and the dates of their appointments are set out in the schedule

1 annexed to this petition produced marked P 1.

Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration, Provincial Councils and

Local Government has issued the Public Administration Circular No.

47/1989 dated 1989-09-27, addressed to secretaries to all ministries and

heads of all departments which is produced marked P 3.

" .

The complaint made to this court by the Petitioners is that the 1st

Respondent had absorbed certain petitioners to certain grades on the dates

shown in paragraph 27 of the petition.

It is the claim of the Petitioners that they would have got their promotions

if the 1st Respondent had implemented the said Public Administration

Circular No. 47/1989 despite the fact that the above absorptions had been

made. The Petitioners therefore state that they have a legitimate

expectation to get their promotions in terms of the said Public

Administration Circular No. 47/1989.

It is on that basis that the Petitioners have invoked the writ jurisdiction of

this court praying for:

1. A writ of Mandamus to compel the Respondents to implement the

Public Administration Circular No. 47/1989 dated 1989-09-27.

II. A writ of Mandamus "more specifically considering the effective date

as 01-01-1989 with due promotions and other entitlements and

privileges derived from the promotions if given to the Petitioners"l

Learned counsel for both parties have requested this Court, to

pronounce the judgment after considering the written submissions the

parties would file and hence this Court afforded both parties opportunity

to file their respective written submissions. Therefore this judgment

would be based on the material that has been adduced by parties in

their written submissions.

It has to be noted at the outset that the circular marked P 3 which is

sought to be implemented by the Petitioners is a circular issued in the

year 1989, about 12 years before this application was filed.

It is common ground that the Gazette Extraordinary bearing No.

1.002/13 dated 1997-11-19 produced marked P 5 brought all librarians

in the public service except those in provincial council public service

under a unified service under the control of the Director General

Combined Services with effect from 1997-08-01 through a publication of

a minute.

It is the position of the Petitioners that they continue to serve under the

appointing authority which is the Secretary, Ministry of Education or the

Education Services Committee until they are absorbed individually, as

per the circular No. 21/ 1998 dated 1998-09-23 produced marked P 6.

It is on that footing that the Petitioners pray for a Writ of Mandamus on

the Respondents to implement the old circular marked P 3 dated 1989-

09-27.

It is to be noted that the circular No. 21/ 1998 dated 1998-09-23

referred to above (marked P 6) has brought all the Librarians serving in

the public service except those in provincial council public service under

a unified service. This means that it is no longer possible to have the

7

scheme set out in the old circular marked P 3 operational. This means

that the said old circular cannot be applied to any scheme of promotions

etc. All what the circular No. 21/ 1998 dated 1998-09-23 marked P 6

states is that those who have not been fully absorbed to the unified

service above referred to, will continue to work under their appointing

authority.

It is clear from the above facts that the old circular marked P 3 dated

1989-09-27 which is sought to be implemented by the Petitioners has

been superseded by the Gazette Extraordinary bearing No. 1.002/13

dated 1997-11-19 marked P 5. Thus the Petitioners could not have had

any legitimate expectation to get any promotion under the old circular.

Further the Petitioners have failed to prove before this Court that the

Respondents have at any time given a promise or an undertaking or

that they had breached a procedural fairness towards the rights and

expectations of the Petitioners. Similarly it cannot be said that the

Respondents are under a legal duty to perform any such act under an

obsolete circular.

In the case of Vasana Vs. Incorporated Council of Legal Education and

others2 Gamini Amaratunga J stated as follows; " ... A writ of mandamus

is available against a public or a statutory body performing statutory

duties of a public character. In order to succeed in an application for a

writ of mandamus the petitioner has to show that he or she has legal

right and the respondent corporate, statutory or public body has a legal

duty to recognize and give effect to the petitioner's legal right. ,,"

'"

The Supreme Court endorsed the above view in the judgment it

delivered in the case of Wannigama Vs. Incorporated Council of Legal

Education and others3 The Petitioners in this case has established

neither of the above requirements before this Court.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons this court decides

to refuse this application and proceeds to dismiss the same. However

this Court makes no order for costs.
