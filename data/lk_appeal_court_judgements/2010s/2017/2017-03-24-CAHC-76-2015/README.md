Order

P.R. Walgama, J

The instant order concerns an application made by the

SSC appearIng for the Attorney General to decide the

matter In limine, as the petition of the Accused-

Appellant is barred by positive rule of law, vi z. - as it is

time barred.

The Accused - Appellant was indicted by the Attorney

General for the charge of Grave Sexual Abuse under

Section 365 (B) (2) (B) of the Penal code as amended by

Acts No: 22 of 1995, 29 of 1998 and 16 of 2006.

As the Accused - Appellant was absconding at the

commencement of the trial at the High Court, the trial

proceeded In absentia, and was convicted of the above

charge and sentenced to 7 years Regorious Imprisonment

with a fine of Rs. 20,000/- carrying a default sentence of

6 months of Simple imprisonment and Rs. 50,000/-as

compensation to the victim, carrying a default sentence of

6 months of Simple Imprisonment. The said verdict and

the sentence was pronounced on 15.10.2013. pursuant to

the afore said an open warrant was issued on the afore

said date.

The Accused-Appellant surrendered to court on 24.04.2014.

An application was made to court In terms of Section

241 (3) and an inquiry was held and the trial Judge

by IS order dated 28.05.2014 refused the application

and made order for the sen tence be effective from

24.04.2014.

It is being noted that the Accused - Appellant had filed

the Petition of Appeal on 15.06.2015. Therefore at a

cursory glance it is obvious that at the time of preferring

this appeal it was out of time.

Hence it is the contention of the counsel for the

Respondent, that the Accused - Appellant has failed to file

the appeal within 14 days from the date of conviction,

which is a mandatory requirement in section 331 (1) of the

Criminal Procedure code Act No: 15 of 1979.

It t l

For convenIence and brevity the above section IS

reproduced here under

"An appeal under this chapter may be lodged by presenting

a petition of appeal or application for have to appeal to the

Registrar of the High Court within fourteen days from the

date when the conviction, sentence or order sought to be

appealed against was pronounced" .

Therefor it is seen from the above, the instant petition of

appeal has been preferred even after the expiration one

year.

The above legal position was confirmed and established

by host of decided cases. It was recognized in the case

II

of Rajapaksa .VS- the State (2001) 2 SLR - 161 which has

been stated thus.

" The period of time ,vithin which an appeal should be

preferred must be calculated from the date on which the

. " reasons are gIven ....... . f I

"An application in Revision should not be entertained save

in exceptional circumstances. When considering this Issue

court must necessary have regard to the contumacious

conduct of the accused in jumping bail and thereafter his

conduct In a manner to circumvent and subvert the

process of land and judicial institution. In addition, the

party should come before Court without a delay". Even to

consider the Petitioner's application in revision the court well

follow the pronouncement in the said above cases. ( emphasis

added)

The above principle was recognized In the case of

Padmasiri -VS. Attorney General (2012) 2 SLR - 24 - and was

held thus.

"therefore we hold that the petition of appeal IS not

properly constituted and it IS out of time. There is no

right of appeal against the order made on the 06.01.2002,

under Section 241 (3) because section 331 gIves only the

forum jurisdiction. We have in the absence of the accused

5

and we find that there 1S no prOV1S1on made for the

appeals against the orders made under section 241 (3).

Therefore it is ostensible that the Court of Appeal is empowered

to exercise its discretion to have recourse to the rev1s10nary

jurisdiction to review an order made under the above mentioned

section.

Before delving on the merits of the petition of appeal, the

Appellate court should deal with the undue delay and

contumacious conduct of the Accused - Appellant.

It was thus held in the case of Opatha Mudiyanselage Perera

- Vs- Attorney General CA - Revision 532/97.

"These matters must be considered 1n limine before the

court decides to hear the Accused - Petitioner on the merits of I

his application. Before he passes the gateway to relief his

aforesaid contumacious conduct and his unreasonable and

determination made upon those matters before he is heard on ,

undue delay in filing the application must be considered and

the merits of the application". (emphasis added)

In perusing the proceeding relating to the inquiry held in

terms of section 241 (3) it is abundantly clear from the testimony

of the Accused - Appellant that he had appeared in the

Magistrate Court in the Non summary inquiry, and he was on

bail. He was aware of the matter in hand. Due to some reason

he and his family has sold the property at Anuradhapura and

moved to Colombo. But he has admitted that he knew that

there was no conclusion of the proceedings. It is also being

noted that he has never informed court of changing his place

of abode.

In the said backdrop the Learned Trial Judge was of the View

that the reasons adduced by the Accused - Appellant do not

merit any variation of the sentence, by allowing the application

made under Section 241 (3) the Criminal procedure code.

At this juncture it is worthy to be mentioned that the case law

referred to by the counsel for the Accused - Appellant do not

fall within the facts of this case.

The case In hand vanes from above. The Accused-

Appellant appeared in the Magistrate Court. He was enlarged

7

on bail. He decided to leave the place where he was

residing even without informing the change of residence to

the police. In the result he was arrested. The cumulative

effect of these factors will only establish his

contumacious behavior, of the Accused - Appellant.

The Learned Trial Judge has considered the facts stated

above and arrived at the inescapable conclusion that

the reasons gIven by the Accused -Appellant do not

warrant to set aside the judgment and conviction entered

on 15.10.2013.

Hence, Preliminary objection up held.

For the foregoing reasons we dismiss the Appeal.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed.
