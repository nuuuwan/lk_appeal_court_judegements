This is an appeal against a judgment of the District Court of Mount

Lavinia.

This appeal was argued before a bench comprising of myself and HlL

Madawala J. Due to sudden demise of Madawala J. the President's Counsel

for both parties requested me to deliver the judgment. Accordingly, I deliver

this judgment as a single judge bench.

The Plaintiff Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and referred

to as the Respondent) instituted this action in the District Court of Mt.

Lavinia claiming compensation for the damages caused to her house by

constructing a building in the adjoining land by the Defendant Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Appellant). After trial

the learned District Judge delivered the judgment in favour of the

Respondent. Being aggrieved by the said judgment, this appeal was

presented.

The ownership of the two lands, i.e. the Respondent's land and the

Appellant's land was admitted. The construction of the Appellant's building

adjoining the Respondent's house was also admitted. Further the damages in

the Respondent's house were also not in issue. The only issues are whether

the damages were caused by the construction of the Respondents house or

not and the quantification of the damages.

The Respondent in her evidence stated that the cracks in the walls and

in the concrete slab started only after the Appellant started the construction.

The engineer Rathnayake who inspected the premises explained the

damages caused to the house. He was unable to give the exact period that

3

the damages caused. He was of the view that it has to be ascertained by

questioning the neighbours. The Respondent testified to the fact that the

damages caused only after the Appellant started the constructions. The

witness Rathnayake was aware of the fact that the soil of the area is sandy.

The witness called by the Appellant has also not tested the soil. Therefore

there is no reason to disbelieve the witness Rathnayake on the quality of

soil. He has found that the Appellant had not taken any measure to give a

lateral support to the existing building before excavating on the adjoining

boundary and the Appellant admitted this position. Witness Rathnayake

further found that there is a gap in between the foundation constructed by

the Appellant and the edge of the ditch excavated for the foundation. His

opinion is that the cracks may have caused due to the settlement of soil.

A Court commi~sion was issued to the Institute of Engineers to

inspect and report. Their report is filed marked as V 4. In paragraph 2.2.1.

they reported that;

"The crack on the floor slab along wall A is suggestive of

settlement due to ground disturbances. The crack on the floor in the

kitchen appeared to be old crack and it cannot be attributed to

construction of house No. 71.

The afro mentioned factors suggest that there has been some

ground movement adjacent to wall A causing cracking or additions to

the problems of cracks seen in the passage. "

This means that the Court commissioners also of the view that there

was ground movement under the foundation of the Respondent's house.

This report further strengthens the observation of witness Rathnayake

that the damage may have caused due to excavation without offering lateral

support to the Respondent's building.

The Appellant argue that the Respondent's house is a very old house.

The portion which was damaged is a newly build one. It is about 8 to 10

years old, but the other portion of the house is about 30 to 50 years old. The

new section is the one close to the boundary where the excavation was done

and the damage caused to that portion. Therefore the age of the house is

immaterial. The damages caused to the wall parallel to the Appellant's

newly constructed building, not to the old house.

The Appellant's Architect Lakshmanrathne stated that he instructed

the workers not to fix a nail even to the wall of the Respondent because it is

weak. Further he knew that the soil is sandy. Therefore he should have

instructed the Appellant to take precautions before excavating adjoining to

the existing building, but had failed. He states that he did not use the metal

shutters because the vibration can be harmful. It was reveled in ,evidence

that there are several other measures that can be used such as providing

wood panels or even chemically treating the soil to make it hard. Without

doing so he left a space between the foundation and the edge of ditch

allowing the soil to settle.

The finding of the learned District Judge that the damages caused to

the Respondent's house was due to the construction of the Appellant's

building is supported by the evidence. The Appellate Court does not

interfere with a finding of a fact unless it is perverse. (Sarathchandra v.

Dingiri Menike [2004] BLR 76)

Accordingly I see no reason to interfere with the finding of the

learned District Judge.

I dismiss the appeal subject to costs fixed at Rs. 15,0001=
