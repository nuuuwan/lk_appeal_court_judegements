JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Petitioner - Respondent - Respondents (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondents) had filed an information in the Primary

Court of Walasmulla under section 66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act, complaining about an existence of breach of peace between

two parties. The said parties are Respondent - Petitioner - Petitioner

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Petitioner) and the Petitioner-

Respondent - Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Respondents) .

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this complaint, had, by

his order dated 2012-04-20, concluded that the Respondents are entitled

to use the right of way that was the subject matter of the dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge, the Petitioner had filed an application for revision in the Provincial

5

High Court of Southern Province holden at Tangalle seeking a revision of

the order made by the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, had refused to revise the

said order made by the learned Primary Court Judge and proceeded to

dismiss the said revision application affirming the order of the learned

Primary Court Judge.

The Petitioner has prayed in this application that the said order of the

learned High Court Judge as well as the order of the learned Primary Court

Judge be set aside by this Court.

In view of the reasoning given by the learned Primary Court Judge in this

case, it would be more convenient to refer first to the law that should be

applied to a case under section 69 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

Section 69 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act is as follows;

" ... Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of a

land, other than the right to possession of such land or part thereof, the

Judge of the Primary Court shall determine as to who is entitled to the

right which is the subject of the dispute and make an order under sub

section (2) .... "

6

It would be helpful at this stage refer to a passage from the judgment of

the Supreme Court in the case of Ramalingam V Thangarajah1 which had

interpreted the above provision of law. It is as follows;

" ..... On the other hand, if the dispute is in regard to any right to any land

other than right of possession of such land, the question for decision,

according to section 69 (1), is who is entitled to the right which is subject

of dispute. The word "entitle" here connotes the ownership of the right.

The Court has to determine which of the parties has acquired that right, or

is entitled for the time being to exercise that right. In contradistinction to

section 68, section 69 requires the Court to determine the question which

party is entitled to the disputed right preliminary to making an order under

section 69 (2). . .... "

Perusal of the judgment of the learned Magistrate dated 2012-04-20 shows

that the conclusions contained in the said judgment are based on some

photographs, Police observation notes including a sketch produced by

Police, and some writings tendered by persons who claim to have used the

impugned roadway.

It must be borne in mind that the relevant land is a big coconut land. The

position taken up by the Petitioner who is the owner of this land is that the

existing roadway is a road that is being used for transportation of coconut

etc. inside his land. It must be remembered at the outset that the mere

existence of a roadway across this land cannot by itself give a right for

others also to use it. However, it can be seen that the learned Magistrate

as well as the learned High Court Judge have heavily relied on the fact that

there exists a roadway within the land. This Court has to observe that both

the Courts have failed to appreciate the fact that the existence of a

roadway by itself cannot be any license for others to claim an entitlement

to use it. Further, even if the Respondents have used it a mere user by

itself would not get an entitlement to use it. 2

The Respondents in their affidavit3 filed at the Primary Court have sworn to

the fact that they do not have an alternative road. However, it can clearly

be seen that there exists a regular road4 for the Respondents to access

their houses. This shows that there is a clear falsehood in their affidavits.

However, learned Primary Court Judge had failed to appreciate the fact

that such falsehood taints the truthfulness of the facts averred in the said

affidavits.

What appears to this Court is that the Respondents have attempted to

claim a roadway, right across the coconut land of the Petitioner to avoid

taking somewhat circuitous path along their existing regular access way.

This is manifest as at all times it has been the position of the Respondents

that the impugned road is a road over the Petitioner's land. In almost all

the statements they have made to police, the impugned roadway has been

Respondents cannot be permitted to use such a roadway over somebody

else's land without proving any lawful entitlement thereto.

It is the view of this Court that the Respondents have failed to prove to the

satisfaction of Court that they are entitled to the impugned roadway.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons this Court decides to

set aside both the judgment of the learned Primary Court Judge dated

5 Statement produced marked e o 8.

6 Statement produced marked e o 10.

2012-04-20 and the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated

2015-07-08. This Court makes order that the Respondents are not entitled

to use the impugned roadway. Therefore, the petition filed in the Primary

Court by the Respondents shall stand dismissed.

Petitioner is entitled to the costs of these litigations.
