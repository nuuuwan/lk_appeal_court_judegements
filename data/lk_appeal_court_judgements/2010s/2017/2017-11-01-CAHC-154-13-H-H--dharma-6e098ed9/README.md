The Accused Appellant was indicted before the High Court of

Anuradhapura on four charges.

1. That on or about 04.07.1997 the Appellant along with those

unknown to the prosecution formed an unlawful assembly with the

common object of abducting Chamila Thushari Perera thereby

committing an offence punishable under section 140 of the Penal

Code.

2. At the same time and place in the same transaction committing an

offence punishable under section 357 read with section 140.

3. Committing an offence punishable under section 357 read with

section 32 ofthe Penal Code.

4. Committing an offence punishable under section 364(2)(g) of the

Penal Code

After trial the Appellant was acquitted from 1 st and 2nd charges and

convicted for 3rd and 4th charges and sentenced as follows.

Charge 3 - 5 years RI and Rs. 25000/= fine with a default term of 6

months

Charge 4 - 12 years RI and Rs. 25000/= fine with a default term of 6

months. Compensation of Rs. 100000/= with a default term

of 1 year.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and the sentence the Appellant

presented this appeal.

The victim was called as the PW 1 and she testified in Court that on the

day of the incident she was in the house with her blind father, mother and

two younger siblings. One of her uncle called Somapala was sleeping

outside the house. In the night at about 10.00 or 11.00, a gang of persons

3

had come to the house and first assaulted Somapala and came in to the

house. Then she was hand cuffed and forcibly carried to the nearby jungle

and was raped. A torch light was flashed towards her but accidently it

was focused on the Appellant and she was able to identify the Appellant

as Wasantha who was living nearby the cemetery. She has asked the

Appellant Wasantha why are you doing this to me and then the Appellant

with the others ran away.

The Appellant's main grounds of appeal were the mistaken identity and

the alibi of the Appellant. Therefore, I will first consider the point raised

by the learned Counsel for the Appellant with regard to the identity. The

Appellant is a person known to the victim from her childhood. She knew

his father and where he was living. When the flash light was focused on

the Appellant she identified the Appellant. In her complaint to the police

she had given the name of the Appellant to the police. This corroborates

her evidence. The Appellant in his evidence stated that he do not know

the victim. The victim very specifically stated that she knew the

Appellant. The victim further testified that the Appellant had proposed to

her for a relationship two weeks prior to the incident and she had not

agreed. These circumstances very strongly prove that the victim has

identified the Appellant correctly.

The second ground of appeal is that the alibi of the Appellant was not

considered. The alibi is that the Appellant was living in his maternal

aunt's house on the day of the incident and he did not know the victim.

The learned High Court Judge had not believed the Appellant on the point

that he did not know the victim. The victim was not confronted with the

alibi of the Appellant that he was living somewhere else on that day.

Therefore the evidentiary value of the Appellant's evidence is less.

THE KING v. MARSHALL et al. 51 NLR 157

(i) An alibi is not an exception to criminal liability, like a plea

of private defence or grave and sUdden-provocation. An alibi

is nothing more than an evidentiary fact, which, like other

facts relied on by an accused, must be weighed in the scale

against the case for the prosecution. If sufficient doubt is

created in the minds of jury as to whether the accused was

present at the scene at the time the offence was committed,

then, the prosecution has not established its case beyond

reasonable doubt, and the accused is entitled to be acquitted.

Rex v. Chandrasekera (1942) 44 N. L. R. at p. 126, and Rex

v. Fernando (1947) 48 N. L. R. at p. 251, applied.

If the evidentiary value is lowered, the fact that the Appellant was at

some other place cannot be acted upon in the instant case. It does not

create a doubt in the mind of the Court.

I do not see any reason to interfere with the conviction.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant made an application to reconsider

the sentence in the event of the Court is not setting aside the conviction.

The Appellant was convicted 16 years after committing the offence and

the life of the Appellant and the victim has changed considerably. The

Appellant is now married and having a child. He has not committed any

offence before or after committing this offence. I do not for a moment

take the offence committed by the Appellant lightly, but the life of the

child and the wife of the Appellant is a matter that should not escape from

the consideration when imposing the sentence. Accordingly I hold that

ordering the imprisonment term to run consecutively is too harsh.

I order that the two terms of imprisonments imposed on the Appellant on

3rd and 4th charges shall run concurrently. I further order that the term of

imprisonment ordered shall run from the date of conviction and sentence

i.e. 20.08.2013.

Appeal partially allowed. No costs.
