JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

When the above numbered cases namely, C A (Tax) Appeal No. 01/ 2011

and C A (Tax) Appeal No. 21/ 2013 were taken up for argument on 2017-

01-30, learned counsel for both parties agreed that the issues to be

decided by this court in respect of both these cases are the same.

4

Learned counsel for both parties hence agreed that it would suffice for this

Court to pronounce one judgment in respect of both the above cases.

Therefore this judgment must apply to both the cases above referred to.

The Appellant is a state enterprise established by Act No. 28 of 1961

engaged in importing, refining, selling, and distributing petroleum products

in Sri Lanka.

The dispute arose when the Respondent rejected the Appellant's claim that

the deemed dividend tax has to be calculated on the taxable profit of the

corporation during the respective years of assessments and that the

appellant corporation did not attract such tax liability as it did not return

any taxable income for the said respective years.

The Respondent having rejected the Appellant's tax return on that basis

had issued a fresh assessment.

In C A (Tax) Appeal No. 01/ 2011, the Appellant being dissatisfied with the

fresh assessment had submitted an appeal against the said assessment to

the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Commissioner General). The Commissioner General

referred the said appeal to the Board of Review. The Board of Review

having heard the submissions of parties confirmed the assessment and

dismissed the said appeal of the Appellant. Being dissatisfied with the

decision of the Board of Review the Appellant had made an application to

state a case for the opinion of the Court of Appeal which is the instant

appeal.

In C A (Tax) Appeal No. 21/ 2013 the Appellant being dissatisfied with the

refusal of his claim by the assessor, appealed to the Commissioner General

of Inland Revenue. The Commissioner General in the determination made

on 2011-10-21, confirmed the assessment of the Assessor. Being

dissatisfied with the said determination, the Appellant appealed to the Tax

Appeals Commission. The Tax Appeals Commission having heard the

submissions of parties confirmed the assessment and dismissed the appeal

of the Appellant. The Appellant, being dissatisfied with the decision of the

Tax Appeals Commission, took steps to have a case stated for the opinion

of the Court of Appeal which is the other instant appeal.

In C A (Tax) Appeal No. 01/ 2011, the two questions of law that have been

formulated for the opinion of this Court by the Board of Review is as

follows.

6

Question No.1

"Did the Board of Review err in law when it interpreted section 33(1) (c) of

the Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979 (as amended) to mean that it was

not the taxable income but the book profits that were to be taken into

consideration when computing income tax liability under the aforesaid

section 7 "

Question No.2

"In view of the facts and circumstances of the case did the Board of

Review err in law by coming to the conclusion that it did 7"

In C A (Tax) Appeal No. 21/ 2013, the two questions of law that have been

formulated for the opinion of this Court by the Tax Appeals Commission is

as follows.

Question No.1

"Did the Tax Appeals Commission err in law when it came to the conclusion

Ifthat the profits for the computation of deemed dividend tax, as

contemplated by section 61 (1) (c) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of

i

I

~

2006 (as amended) should be book profits 7"

7

Question No.2

"In view of the facts and circumstances of the case did the Tax Appeals

Commission err in law when it came to the conclusion that it did 7"

It must be mentioned here that the wording appear in both section 33(1)

(c) of Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979 as amended and section 61(1)

(c) of Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 as amended are similar. As the

parties have based their submissions, and the subsequent written

submissions filed, on section 33(1) (c) of the Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of

1979, it would be prudent to commence the exercise of considering the

above questions of law by reproducing the relevant parts of section 33 (I)

of the Inland Revenue Act, No 28 of 1979 (as amended). (This Act 3 would

hereinafter be referred to as the Act in this judgment). It is the contents of

this section and similar content in section 61 (1) (C)4 that this Court is

called upon to interpret in the instant cases.

" .... The income tax to which any company resident in Sri Lanka in any I year of assessment shall be liable for that year of assessment shall consist

of -

a) an amount calculated on the taxable income of such company for

that year of assessment at the appropriate rate specified in the

Second Schedule to this Act as the rate applicable to companies of

that class; and

b) ...... .

c) in the case of any public corporation not less than seventy five per

centum of the capital of which is provided by the Government, other

than by way of a loan, for any year of assessment commencing on or

after April 1, 1986 (hereinafter referred to as "the relevant year of

assessment"), an amount equal to twenty five per centum of the

balance of its profits for that year of assessment after deducting

therefrom the tax payable for that year of assessment under

paragraph (a):

Provided that where the aggregate amount of any gross dividends

distributed in the relevant year of assessment out of the profits on which

9

the taxable income of such corporation is computed for any year of

assessment commencing on or after April 1, 1986-

i. is not less than twenty five per centum of such balance, the

provisions of this paragraph shall not apply; and

ii. is less than twenty five per centum of such balance, the tax to which

such public corporation is liable under this paragraph, for the relevant

year of assessment, shall be an amount equal to the excess of

twenty five per centum of such balance over such amount of such

dividends.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the profits of the Insurance

Corporation of Sri Lanka shall be deemed not to include its profits from the

business of life insurance; and ...... "

As the task of this Court in this case involves interpreting some provisions

of taxing statutes, it would be prudent to bear in mind the applicability of

some of the basic principles that may become relevant when this Court

undertakes the task of interpreting such provisions in this case.

These principles are;

,

I

f t I I If i r f F

~ f: ! I

10

i. that a person can be charged with tax not by inference or analogy,

but only by the plain words of the provisions in the taxing statutes.

ii. that no tax can be imposed on any person unless there are clear

words in the statute which should show a clear intention on the part

of the legislature to impose liability to income tax on a person.

iii. that principles of equity should not be applied when interpreting such

provisions.

iv. that once a liability to income tax is found, the subject cannot escape

taxation unless he can find a clear exempting section.

The above principles make it clear that Courts can neither presume nor

imply any intendment as to tax. It must only look carefully at the section of

the statute. This must be so in view of the fact that the subject is entitled

to arrange his affairs so as to reduce his liability to tax.

In Cape Brandy Syndicate V Inland Revenue Commissioners 5 Rowlatt J

stated as follows; " ... It is urged by Sir William Finlay that in a taxing Act

clear words are necessary in order to tax the subject. Too wide and fanciful

a construction is often sought to be given to that maxim, which does not

r mean that words are to be unduly restricted against the Crown, or that

5 1921 (1) K B 64 at page 71

f J II' I If I I I ,-

(

I

11

there is to be any discrimination against the Crown in those Acts. It simply

means that in a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said.

There is no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There

is no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be

implied. One can only look fairly at the language used .... "

The case of Trust Union Shipping Corporation V Commissioner General of

Inland Revenue6 is an instance where this Court had adopted the above

principles referring to the said cape Brandy Syndicate 7 case. Thus, bearing

these principles in mind it is now time to turn to the section to be

interpreted.

The liability of the Appellant to income tax under section 33 (1) (c) is

clearly mentioned as " .... an amount equal to twenty five per centum of

the balance of its profits for that year of assessment after deducting

therefrom the tax payable for that year of assessment under paragraph

(a): .... ".

6 2003 (3) Sri L R 43.

12

The above phrase could be arranged in to a formula which for the

purposes of convenience and clarity would be termed as formula 1 in this

judgment. The said formula 1 would read as follows;

Formula 1

Tax liability8 under section 33 (1) (c) = 25% of [Appellant's profits9 - tax

payable10 under paragraph (a) ]

The phrase 'paragraph (ay above means section 33(1) (a).

It is clear that the Appellant's liability to income tax in the particular year of

assessment under section 33 (1) (a) of the Act shall be an amount

calculated on the taxable income of the Appellant for that year of

assessment. It must be observed that the term 'taxable income' has

specifically been mentioned in this sectionll.

When one traverses through the provisions of the Inland Revenue Act, it

becomes clear;

i. that it is necessary to ascertain the assessable income of the tax

payer in order to determine his taxable income,

8 For a given year of assessment.

9 For that year of assessment.

10 For that year of assessment.

11 Section 33 (1) (a).

I i !

13

ii. that it is necessary to ascertain the statutory income of the tax payer

in order to determine his assessable income.

iii. that it is necessary to ascertain the income of the tax payer in order

to determine his statutory income.

The above concepts could be organized into a chart which should appear

as follows;

Income T Statutory income 1 Assessable income

TJable income

Thus, it would be necessary for the tax levying authorities, in order to

calculate the tax chargeable from a tax payer, to first identify his income.

For an instance section 24 of the Inland Revenue Act, No 28 of 1979 has

specified as to what deductions are not allowed in calculating the profits or

income of any person. It must be observed that the term used in section

III

14

24 also is 'profits or income of any person'. This is a phrase12 that has been

defined in section 163 of the Act.

Once profits or income of the tax payer has been determined the tax

levying authorities must then determine the statutory income of the tax

payer.

Section 163 of the Act has defined what 'statutory income' is. It is as

follows;

"income from any source computed in accordance with section 25".13

While section 25 of the Act states the basis for computing the statutory

income, section 27 of the Act states how the total statutory income should

be calculated.

Once the statutory income of the tax payer has been determined the tax

levying authorities must then proceed to determine his assessable income.

The phrase 'assessable income' has been defined in the Act as "the

residue of the total statutory income of any person after deducting the

12 'profits or income'

13 Section 163 of Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979.

15

aggregate amount of the deductions to which such person is entitled to

under section 29".14

According to section 29 of the Act the assessable income of a person shall

be the remainder of his total statutory income after the deductions

speCified in that section have been made.

Once the assessable income of the tax payer has been determined the tax

levying authorities must then determine his taxable income.

The term 'taxable income' has been defined in section 163 of the Act as

follows;

" ... 'taxable income' means the residue of assessable income of a person

after deducting the aggregate amount of the allowances to which such

person is entitled to under section 30 ... "

According to section 30 of the Act the taxable income of a person shall be

the remainder of his assessable income after the deductions specified in

that section have been made.

14 Section 163 of Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979.

16

Thus, after deducting from the assessable income, the several allowances

permitted by the Act, the remainder would be identified as the taxable

income.

It would be of additional value here to reproduce the following passage

from the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Rodrigo V The

Commissioner-General of Inland Revenue15 ; " ..... The Act prescribes a step

by step process wherein exemptions and deductions are permitted when

computing the taxable income. To arrive at the taxable income

consideration should be given only to the permissible deductions provided

by the Act and the Court cannot take into consideration any other means of

computing the deductible amounts .. , ,".

Thus, it is rather clear that the liability of the Appellant under section 33

(1) (a) would be an amount calculated on his taxable income. And the said

taxable income has to be calculated according to the provisions of the Act.

15 2002 (1) Sri L R 384.

17

The said tax liability under section 33 (1) (a) could be formed into another

formula which for the purposes of convenience and clarity would be termed

as formula 2 in this judgment. The said formula 2 would read as follows;

Formula 2

Tax liability under section 33 (1) (a) = (specified rate16) x (taxable income)

If the taxable income = 0,

Tax liability under section 33 (1) (a) = (specified rate) x (0)

=0

Thus, it is clear that if the taxable income of the Appellant is zero then the

Appellant's Tax liability under section 33 (1) (a) would also become zero.

In such a situation17 the application of formula 118 would be as follows;

Tax liability19 under section 33 (1) (c) = 25% of [Appellant's profits20 - tax

payable under paragraph (a) 21 ]

16 appropriate rate specified in the Second Schedule to this Act as the rate applicable to companies of that class.

17 When there is no taxable income.

18 Tax liability under section 33 (1) (c).

19 For a given year of assessment.

20 For that year of assessment.

21 For that year of assessment.

\ ! j I I

18

Since tax payable under paragraph (a) = 0, [because there is no taxable income

as shown above]

Tax liability22 under section 33 (1) (c) = 25% of [Appellant's profits23 - 0 ]

= 25% of [Appellant's profits24]

Therefore the tax liability of the Appellant under section 33 (1) (c), would

be an amount equal to 25% of [Appellant's profits].

It must be observed that the term used in section 33 (1) (a) is 'taxable

income' which, as has already been stated, has been defined in the Act. In

contrast, the term used in section 33 (1) (c) is 'profits'. It is thus clear that

the legislature in its wisdom has opted not to repeat25 the term 'taxable

income' in section 33 (1) (c). Therefore, there is no way that the term

'profits' could be equated to the term 'taxable income'. In any case the

term 'taxable income' is a specific term which has a specific definition in

the Act.26

This position is further buttressed by the presence of phrase 'the profits on

which the taxable income of such corporation is computed' in the proviso

22 For a given year of assessment.

23 For that year of assessment.

24 For that year of assessment.

25 As in section 33 (1) (a)

26 Section 163.

19

to section 33 (1) (c). It must be observed that the legislature again in its

wisdom has not opted to use a bear term 'profits' 27 in the proviso to

section 33 (1) (c). The term it has used is 'the profits on which the taxable

income of such corporation is computed'. Thus, the legislature has qualified

the term 'profits' in the proviso of section 33 (1) (c).

This too shows that what the legislature has meant by the term 'profits' in

the main body of section 33 (1) (c) is not what it meant by the term

'taxable income' referred to in section 33 (1) (a).

Further it is important to note that the term 'profits' has also been

specifically defined in the Act. To start with, section 3 of the Act has

specified the meanings that should be given to the terms "profits and

income" or "profits" or "income" for the purposes of the Act. Section 163

then goes on to state that "profits" or "income" means the net profits or

income from any source for any period calculated in accordance with the

provisions of this Act. Further, chapter IV of the Act has extenSively dealt

with the question as how one should ascertain profits or income. In that

chapter sections 23 and 24 have elaborately dealt respectively with the

questions as to what deductions are allowed and what deductions are not

27 As in the main body of section 33 (1) (c).

20

allowed, when ascertaining profits and income. Thus it is not open to give

the term 'profits' which appear in section 33 (1) (c) of the Act, a meaning

which is different from what the Act has specifically given to it. It is

imperative that the tax payer, the tax levying authorities as well as the

Courts interpreting the provisions in the Act must confine themselves to the

clear definitions given in the Act.

Indeed the meaning of the proviso above referred to is that the provision

in the main body of section 33 (1) (c) is not applicable/8 when the gross

dividends the corporation concerned has distributed, out of the profits on

which the taxable income is computed, is not less than 25% of [profits of

the corporation - tax payable under paragraph raJ l29 Since this refers to

an occasion where the corporation concerned has distributed dividends, it

is clear that the reference is to a situation where the coporation has

generated a taxable income. What it means in other words is that when

the aggregate amount of the gross dividends paid by the corporation is not

less than the tax liability under section 33 (1) (c), the corporation would [

not be taxed again separately under section 33 (1) (c) also. Thus the

purpose intended by the legislature appears to be to recover to the state at

28 Limb (i) of proviso to section 33 (1) (c).

29 Formula 1.

I 1 ! ~ . -

~ t least a minimum amount equal to 25% of [corporation's profits - tax

payable under paragraph (a) 130 either by way of dividends when the

corporation has declared dividends or by tax31 under section 33 (1) (c)

when the corporation has not declared dividends.

The fact that the above is the intended purpose of the legislature becomes

manifest from the provisions in limb (ii) in the proviso to section 33 (1) (c).

Accordingly the amount of tax charged when the aggregate amount of

gross dividends the corporation has distributed is less than 25% of

[Appellant's profits - tax payable under paragraph (a) ], the tax to which

such public corporation is liable under section 33 (1) (c), for the relevant

year of assessment, shall be an amount equal to the excess of 25% of

[Appellant's profits - tax payable under paragraph (a) ] over such amount

of such dividends.

To distinguish the relevant differing positions from one another for the

purpose of clarity, followings could be stated.

amount equivalent to 25% of [corporation's profits ]. (which is the

end result of the computation shown below).

Tax liability32 under section 33 (1) (c) = 25% of [Appellant's profits33

Since tax payable under paragraph (a) = 0,

Tax liability35 under section 33 (1) (c) = 25% of [Appellant's profits36

= 25% of [Appellant's profits]

profits on which the taxable income is computed, is not less than

137 the corporation is not liable to pay tax under section 33 (1) (cis

as it has already paid to the state under section 33 (1) (a), an

amount either equal or more than it's liability under section 33 (1)

(c).

3) If the tax payable under paragraph (a) is not zero, and when the

gross dividends the corporation concerned has distributed, out of the

profits on which the taxable income is computed, is less than 25%

of [PJofits of the corporation - tax pavable under paragraph (a) l39

the corporation has to pay to the state under section 33 (1) (C),40 an

additional amount equal to the excess of 25% of [Appellant's profits

-tax payable under paragraph (a) ] over such amount of such

dividends.

The tax liability in such a situation could be formed into a third

formula which for the purposes of convenience and clarity would be

termed as formula 3 in this judgment. The said formula 3 would read

as follows;

37 Formula 1.

38 According to its proviso.

39 Formula 1.

40 Limb (ii) in the proviso to section 33 (1) (c).

Formula 3

Tax liability41 under section 33 (1) (c) 42 = {25% of [corporation's

profits43 - tax payable under paragraph (a) 44] } - {the amount of

the gross dividends the corporation has distributed, out of the profits

on which the taxable income is computed}.

It must be made clear that the tax liability computed according to

formula 3 above is chargeable in addition to the tax payable under

section 33 (1) (a) of the Act.

Thus, the intention of the legislature in enacting section 33 (1) (c) of the

Act is clear. It is to deduct the amount of tax levied under section 33 (1)

(a) from the tax charged under section 33 (1) (c) avoiding double taxation

of corporations.

The Appellant had declared4s in its return of income that it has generated a

business profit computed in terms of the provisions of the Inland Revenue

41 For a given year of assessment.

, -25 . . Act No. 28 of 1979. However it has declared its taxable income as zero.

This is presumably in view of a greater amount of a taxable loss which had

been brought forward from the previous year. This means that the

Appellant has declared 'profits' calculated in accordance with the provisions

of this Act in respect of the relevant period within the meaning of section

163 of the Act.

Therefore there is no legal Justification for the Appellant's contention that

the term 'profits' referred to in section 33 (I) (c) is the taxable income and

not the book profit. Thus, the liability for the Appellant to pay income tax ~

under section 33 (1) (c) of the Act in this instance would be an amount

equal to twenty five per centum of his profits. The term 'profits' has been

defined in the Act, as has already been shown.

For the foregoing reasons it is the considered view of this court that the

Board of Review as well as the Tax Appeals Commission has rightly decided

that it is not on the taxable income that the amount equal to twenty five

per centum has to be calculated in terms of section 33 (1) (c) of the Inland

Revenue Act No.28 of 1979.

26

As parties have agreed, this interpretation must apply to section 61 (1) (c)

of the Inland Revenue Act No. 10 of 2006 (as amended) as wel1.46

Thus, we answer all the four questions47 of law formulated for the opinion

of this Court in the negative.

In these circumstances we decide to affirm the determination by the Board

of Review in C A (Tax) Appeal No. 01/ 2011 as well as the determination

by the Tax Appeals Commission in C A (Tax) Appeal No. 21/ 2013 and

proceed to dismiss both appeals. No cost is ordered.
