This revision application is filed by the Accused-Petitioners to revise the

sentencing order of the learned High Court Judge dated 12/2/2015 and to

impose a reasonable sentence operative from the date and the order of

sentencing dated 12/02/2015.

The Petitioners case was that he was indicted by the High Court of

Colombo in case No 352012006 together with another Accused under

section 32 read with 296 of the Penal Code for committing the murder of

Wijesekara Abeyratnage Siril Francis.

Secondly for committing the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to

Wijesekara Abeysekarage Sirimal Francis under Sec 32 read with 314 of

the Penal Code within the jurisdiction of this court.

The Petitioner pleaded not guilty and the prosecution led the evidence of

several witnesses and closed the case on 18/12/2014. Thereafter the

judgment was pronounced dated on 10102/2015 convicting the Petitioners

and sentencing them 10 year periods of rigorous imprisonment each for the

charged of section 297 of the Penal Code with a fine ofRs50001- in default

06 months rigorous imprisonment and compensation for Rs.80,0001- in

default 01 year rigorous imprisonment. Further the Accused-Petitioners

were convicted and sentenced for the 2nd charge section 314 of the Penal

Code for 06 months rigorous imprisonment and fine ofRs.25001- in default

03 months rigorous imprisonment and Rs.20,0001- compensation payable

to oll t:) 1 in default 6 months rigorous imprisonment.

Being aggrieved by the sentence given by the Learned High Court Judge

the Petitioner has preferred this Revision application. When this matter

came up for hearing on 06/10/2016, oral submissions by both parties were

4

made and argument were concluded. Written submissions by both parties

has been tendered to court and thereafter judgment was reserved on

09/02/2017.

We have considered the oral and written submissions of both counsels. The

Petitioners do not challenge their conviction made by the Learned High

Court Judge. However they have preferred this revision application against

the sentence order of the Learned High Court Judge.

It has been contended that the Learned High Court Judge's order is illegal

irregular capricious or arbitrary. The object of revision is to correct

procedural error. That objections raised by the Learned State Counsel was

that there are no exceptional grounds to maintain this application as a

revision application in law. The Learned High Court Judge was reduced

296 charge to 297 of Penal Code as two limbs; contrary to law, under

section 294. That is sudden fight and also grave provocation which indicate

that the Learned High Court Judge had thought it fit to treat facts and

circumstances under which the offences were committed.

5

It was submitted that the Petitioners had not acted in cruel or inhuman and

degrading manner to attribute the maximum sentence stipulated by law

under said circumstances. Under section 297 of the Penal Code the

Accused has been convicted alternative sentence has been made. The

Medical evidence in page 361 and 362 of the brief that has been injuries

1,2,3 and 4 which were aberrations. The other three wounds were not fatal

wounds, and they could be medically treated.

In the case of Inspector of Police, Awissawella Vs. Fernando 30 NLR

483 it was observed by Akbar J, that in such cases an application in

revision should not be entertained save in exceptional circumstances.

Exceptional circumstances would be, ( a) where there has been a

miscarriage of justice, (b) where a strong case for the interference of this

court has been made by the petitioner, (c) where the applicant was unaware

of the order made by the court of trial.

The Respondent took up the preliminary objections that there is a delay in

filing the revision application made by the Petitioners and the Petitioners

were there by guilty of laches. The order sought to be challenged dated

6

10/2/2015 and the revision application dated 24/1112015. This revision

application has been filed with the delay of 9 months.

In Camillus Ignatious Vs. Officer-In-Charge of Uhana Police Station

CA 907/89 MC Ampara 2587 held, that a mere delay of 4 months in filing

a revision application was fatal to the prosecution of the revision

application.

In the case of S.M.A.A.Priyantha Jayakodi Vs. Officer-In-Charge of

Police Station Marawila in CA(PHC) 119/2004 it was held that a delay

of 7 months is fatal to the exercise revisionary jurisdiction. A revision

application after a delay of 8 months was also considered fatal and was

dismiss in limine.

In the case of Don. Chandra Maximus Illangakoon Vs. OIC of Police

Station of Anuradhapura and the Hon. Attorney General in case No.

CA(PHC) 28/2009, HC Anuradhapura case No. HC.Rev. 26/08 decided

on 21.11.2014.

In the case of Leslie Silva Vs. Perera 2005 2 SLR 184 Somawansa J, at

page 190 of the judgment states thus,

"In this respect I would say it is settled law and our courts time

and again have held that the revisionary jurisdiction of this

court is wide enough to be exercised to avert any miscarriage

of justice irrespective of availability of alternative remedy or

inordinate delay"

Where there has been a delay in discretionary relief it is an essential that

reasons for the delay should be set out in the petition. The Petitioner has

not set out any reasons for the delay in his petition. We find that the

Accused who has been sentenced to section 314 charge of the Penal Code

has been convicted and sentenced 06 months rigorous imprisonment and

fine Rs.2500/- in default 3 months rigorous imprisonment and Rs.20,000/-

compensation payable to ol/ol in default 06 months rigorous

imprisonment. We find that this part of the sentence is excessive and illegal

and there has been a miscarriage of justice. As such I hold that this

sentenced is excessive and is illegal. According to section 314 of the Penal

Code on conviction the Accused is confined to 06 months rigorous

8

imprisonment and fine Rs.lOOO/-In default 01 month simple

imprisonment.

Accordingly, I set aside and vary that part of the sentence made by the

Learned High Court Judge regarding 314 of the penal Code and order the

sentence to read as 06 months rigorous imprisonment and fine ofRs.1 0001-

in default 01 month rigorous imprisonment and Rs.50001- compensation in

default 01 month rigorous imprisonment. As regards the 1 st charge of

Section 297 of the Penal Code, I do not think that the sentence is excessive

as such I affirm the sentence in respect of same.

Accordingly we allow this Revision Application subject to the variation as

aforesaid.

L.T.B.Dehideniya, J

I agree.
