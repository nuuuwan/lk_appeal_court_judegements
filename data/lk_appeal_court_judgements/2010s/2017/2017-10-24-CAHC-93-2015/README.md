indicted in the High Court of Chillaw for the offence of the murder of a 2 Yz

year old boy named Dissanayake Pathiranage Pansilu Prabashwara Weeraman

under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

The Appellant pleaded not guilty to the said charge and the prosecution led the

Dissanayake PW14 and Dr. Wijewardena JMO (PW18) and the evidence of the

Court interpreter and concluded the case for the prosecution.

In brief the case for the prosecution was that PW 1, the mother of the deceased , was living separately from her spouse in a rented house in the Wennapuwa area

with the deceased child who was 2 Yz years of age at that time and her father.

The Appellant was her paramour, who she was expecting to get married after,

obtaining a divorce from her husband. Her husband had the habit of visiting her

to see the deceased child, which the Appellant didn't like.

The deceased child was admitted to a Day Care Centre run by PW 4, where the

child was kept from 8.00 am / 8.30 am - 2.30 pm until she returns from work,

after which she would take the child home. As stated in evidence the child was

in the habit of referring to the Appellant as 'father'.

The night prior to the date of the alleged offence, the Appellant had quarrelled

with PWI regarding her husband's constant visits to her house, to see the child.

The next day when she went to pick her child from the Day Care Centre PW 4

had informed her that the now deceased child was picked up by the Appellant.

Sensing some form of foul play PWl, PW4 and PW3 commenced a search for

the child. The Appellant when contacted over the phone denied having picked

up the child and acted in a suspicious manner. Even after meeting the search

party, the Appellant had denied taking the child with him. However, after been

confronted by both PW3 and PW 4 the Appellant had left the scene in an

irritated manner. The fact that the Appellant took the child from the day care

centre was corroborated by witnesses.

4

Consequent to a complaint to Seeduwa Police the Appellant was arrested and

handed over to PW 11 of the Wennapuwa Police.

The body of the deceased child was thereafter found on a rec~very under

Section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance under the Ging Oya Bridge situated

along the Colombo - Chillaw road. The JMO (PWI8) giving evidence opined

that the cause of death was gagging by applying external force on and around

the nose and mouth area of the child.

The Appellant opted to make a dock statement denying culpability and the

learned High Court Judge delivered a verdict of guilty and sentenced the

Appellant to death.

As correctly contended by the learned Counsel for the Appellant the case for the

prosecution rested on circumstantial evidence which were;

a) The Appellant was last seen in the company of the deceased on the date

of the incident,

b) The dead body was found consequent to a statement made by the

Appellant and further it is the Appellant who led the police to where the

body of the deceased lay.

c) The Cause of death was asphyxia due to stuffing a piece of cloth into the

oral cavity and applying pressure around the mouth and nose.

It was further stated in evidence that the Appellant, who was a driver in a

Company, had left the Company premises on the day in question in the van

5

assigned to him and there was an unexplainable absence from work during

11.2Sam - 1.lSpm. This could explain how the Appellant could have reached

the day care centre by 12.0Spm and picked up the child. PWll IP Manohara in

is evidence has stated that the exact place where the body was recqvered from,

was not visible even after arriving at the said location and it had been the

Appellant, who had pointed to the exact place where the deceased body lay,

around four feet into the water. The items of clothing the deceased child was

dressed in CP4, PI, P2 and P3) at the time of discovery was identified by PW3

and PW 4 as what the child was dressed in at the time he left with the Appellant.

Therefore, evidence elucidated by the prosecution can be seen as strong

circumstantial evidence. This coupled with the subsequent conduct of the

Appellant i.e. been aggressive towards PW 1 when she inquired about the child,

not helping to search for the child and not assisting in preferring a complaint to

the Police regarding the child infers strong evidence pointing at the guilt of the

Appellant.

With this insurmountable evidence against the Appellant, the Appellant opted to

simply deny any culpability by making an unsworn statement from the dock. As

the learned SSC has fittingly noted, it was simply a three line bare denial of the

allegation to which the learned Trial Judge has correctly applied the dictum of

Lord Elenborough in Rex v. Cochrane, Gamey's Reports, page 479. which

states;

" No person accused of crime is bound to offer any explanation of his

conduct or of circumstances of suspicion which attach to him; but,

nevertheless, if he refuses to do so where a strong prima facie case has

been made out, and when it is in his own power to offer evidence, if such

6

exist, in explanation of such suspicious circumstances which would show

them to be fallacious and explicable consistently with his innocence, it is

a reasonable and justifiable conclusion that he refrains from doing so only

from the conviction that the evidence so suppressed or not adduced would

operate adversely to his interest".

This dictum was applied in several cases including The King V s. L. Seeder de

Silva 41 NLR page 337, The King Vs. Geekiyanage John Silva 46 NLR 73,

Queen V s. Seetin 68 NLR 316, Republic V s. Illangathilaka 1984 2 SLR page

38, ChadradasaVs. Queen 72 NLR page 160.

In James Silva v. the Republic of Sri Lanka (1980) 2 Sri.! R p167 at176

following the Privy Council case of Jayasena v. The Queen 72 NLR 313 (PC)

stated;

'A satisfactory way to arrive at a verdict of guilt or innocence is to

consider all the matters before the Court adduced whether by the

prosecution or by the defence in its totality without compartmentalizing

and, ask himself whether as a prudent man, in the circumstances of the

particular case, he believes the accused guilty of the charge or not guilty.'

In the case of AG Vs. Potta Naufer & others 2007(2) SLR 144 Thilakawardena

J held that;

'When relying on circumstantial evidence to establish the charge of

conspiracy to commit murder and the charge of murder, the proved items

of circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point

towards the only inference that the accused committed the offence.'

7

In the case of Kusumadasa V s. State 2011 (1) SLR 240 Sisira de Abrew J has

held that;

'The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had

the opportunity of committing the offence. The accused c'an be found

guilty only and only if the proved items of circumstantial evidence is

consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their innocence.'

Also in the case of Sarath Fernando Vs. Attorney General 2014 (1) SLR 16 it

was held that;

'In order to justify the inference of guilt from purely circumstantial

evidence the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence

of the accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable

hypothesis than that of his guilt.'

In Premawansha V. Attorney General 2009 (2) SLR 205 relied by the learned sse for the Respondent Sisira de Abrew J has held that;

'In a case of circumstantial evidence if an inference of guilt is to be

drawn, such an inference must be the one and only irresistible and

inescapable conclusion that the accused committed the offence'

He further held that;

"Although there was no judicial evaluation of evidence learned trial

Judge on the evidence led at the trial could not have arrived at any other

conclusion other than the conclusion reached by him.

Although the circumstantial evidence has not been specifically analysed by the

learned Trial Judge in the instant case this Court finds that the strong

corroborated circumstantial evidence against the Appellant aforementioned,

when taken together points, to the only inference that no one other than the

Appellant could have committed the offence. Therefore in this caseJhe learned

High Court Judge could not have mTived at any other conclusion other than to

find the Appellant guilty.

In light of the above this Court finds no reason to disturb the findings of the

learned High Court Judge and therefore affirms the conviction and sentence of

the learned High Court Judge and dismisses the instant appeal.

Appeal Dismissed.
