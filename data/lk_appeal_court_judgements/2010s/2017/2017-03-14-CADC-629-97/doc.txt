M.M.A.Gaffoor,J.

The Plaintiff-Appellant above named instituted the action No.41081L in the

District Court of Matale seeking inter alia for a declaration of title to the land

morefully described in the schedule to the plaint and to eject the defendant-

respondent there from. The plaintiff-appellant pleaded that the land in dispute as

described is the schedule to the plaint as " Boraluwewatta" and described as to

how the title was devolved on him.

The defendant in his answer denied the averments contained in the plaint

and recited the tile to a larger land known as " Kongedarawatta" described in the

schedule of the answer.

However in the evidence of surveyor Mr.Ranchagoda who was the 2nd

Commissioner gave evidence on behalf of defendant and his plan supports the

contention of the plaintiff and the name of the land is described as "Boraluewatta "

which is against the contention of the defendant.

In a rei-vindicatio action the cause of action is based on the sole ground of

violation of right of ownership to the land. In a rei- vindicatio action the plaintiff

claims as the owner of the land he has the dominum and that land is in the unlawful

possession of the defendant.

In this matter it is important to consider whether plaintiff-appellant proved

he has the dominum to the land more fully described in the schedule of the plaint.

In the case of Gnaneswary and others Vs. Kanapathi - Pillai Thamu and

other BASL news 51512004 CA. Appeal No.642186 (F) decided by Shirani

Thilakawardena J. (PICA) and P.Wijeyarathe J. allowing appeal held" In the case

of Muithusamy Vs. Seneviratne 321 CLW 91 it has been specifically stated that in

action for declaration of title it is for the plaintiff to establish his title to the land he

claims and not for the defendant to show that the plaintiff has no title. In the cases

of Peiris V s. Sevunhamy 54 NLR Pg. 207 where it has been held in an action for

declaration of title to land where the defendant is in possession of the land in

dispute, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that he has the dominum. In a rei

vindication action the plaintiff must provide and establish his title. He cannot ask

for a declaration of title in his favour merely on the strength of the defendant's title

is poor or is not established. All these cases have been followed by the case of

Luwis Singho Vs. Ponnemperuma ( 1996) 2 Sri LR Pg. 320.

In this matter plaintiff -respondent state in his plaint inter alia that the

preIll1ses belonged to Pakker Thambi Uthuma Lebbe who executed the deed of

Transfer bearing No.3490 dated 1903.05.11 attested by Kandaiaa Murugesu Pillai

Notary Public and thereby transferred his rights to Hasan Ali who is the father of

Plaintiff's father Seiadu Mohammadhu Abdul Cader, the only son of said Hassan

Ali and departed his life leaving as his intestate heir, his child Seiasdu

Mohammadhu Abdul Cader. After the said Abdul Cader demised, his children the

plaintiff and his siblings and mother became entitled to his property. Further

plaintiff stated in his plaint that his Siblings and mother Ummu Raseena

Transferred their rights to the plaintiff by deed No. 9372 dated 25.01.1990 attested

by S.B. Wijerathne N.P and plaintiff became the lawful owner of the said premises

which deed was marked in evidence as P2, but it was not in the record when Trial

Judge delivered his judgment. Once a document is marked at the trial by a party it

is the duty of the said party to submit that deed before the judgment even with

I

written submissions. But the plaintiff failed to submit the document marked as P2

in his plaint. In this circumstance the ownership of the plaintiff is not established.

As stated above, in a rei indication action plaintiff cannot expect relief unless

and until he proves his case. The judgment of the learned District Judge has

specifically stated about the absence of P2 which is the deed is the vital piece of

evidence to prove the title of the plaintiff. The plaintiff cannot expect the court to

go on a voyage of discovery to ascertain the title of the plaintiff.

Though, the appellant in his written submission to this Court, states that the

plaintiff s Instructing- Attorney passed away during the trial, the appeal brief does

not indicate such a predicament faced by the appellant.

As per Section 114 of the Civil Procedure Code, there is a duty cast on the

part of the Trial Judge to endorse the materiel marked documents, at the same time

it is the duty of the party and the Registered- Attorney to tender all marked

documents to court.

The document marked P2 the bone of contention in this case, has been

marked without subject to proof and had not been objected at the close of the

plaintiffs case. The learned Trial Judge at the close of the case( Proceedings dated

30.01.1997) has specifically stated that document marked P2 to be filed in the case

record.

In the light of the above circumstances the learned Trial Judge has properly

acted in compliance with Section 114 of the Civil Procedure Code.

In these circumstances, I am in view that the learned District Judge has very

carefully and correctly arrived at his determination with correct perspective and

analyzed all the verbal and documentary evidence placed before him to come his

conclusion. I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned District

Judge.

Therefore the appeal is dismissed without costs.
