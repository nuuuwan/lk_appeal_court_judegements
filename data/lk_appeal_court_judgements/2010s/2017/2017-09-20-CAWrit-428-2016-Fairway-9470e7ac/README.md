L.T.B.Dehideniya J.

The Petitioner in this case has obtained pennission from the 1 st

Respondent, Urban Development Authority, to use the land in question

for a car park. The Petitioner submits that he has spent a substantial

amount of money to develop the land. The 1 st Respondent without

entering in to a lease agreement, with the Petitioner, has canceled the

permission given to the Petitioner. The Petitioner, among other reliefs,

has prayed for an interim relief to prevent the Respondents from

interfering with the possession of the Petitioners and to prevent leasing

the land or giving permission use it to a third party. The Respondents

objected to this application.

The Petitioner has not entered in to any lease agreement with the 1 st

Respondent. The Petitioner was granted permission to use the land

temporary until the parties enter into a lease agreement. Under the UDA

Act the 1 st Respondent cannot enter into any lease agreement without the

approval of the Minister in charge of the subject. Even if the Board of

Management of the 1 st Respondent agrees to grant a lease, the final

approval has to be given by the Minister. In the present case the Minister

has not given his approval to the lease agreement and the parties have not

entered into any lease agreement.

The 1 st Respondent is a Government institution but the dealings of

the Petitioner and the 1 st Respondent in relation to the land in question are

in the nature of private transaction where the public/administrative law

has no application. The transaction in short is that the 1 st Respondent

permitted the Petitioner to use the land in question for a car park and on

the expectation of entering into a lease agreement for 30 years, the

Petitioner developed the land but later the 1 st Respondent canceled the

permission given to the Petitioner. The Petitioner may have a remedy in

private law but on the face of the application, the transaction is not

amenable to writ jurisdiction.

Under these circumstances, we refuse to issue an interim order.

We order to issue notice on Respondents.
