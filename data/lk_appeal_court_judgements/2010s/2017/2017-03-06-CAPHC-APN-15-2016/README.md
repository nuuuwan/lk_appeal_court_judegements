This Petition has been preferred by the Petitioner to this Court to

revise the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Negambo on

03112/2015. The Petitioner states that she is the wife of the 4th suspect

named Sundara Raj Khrishna Mogan who was arrested on 05/02/2015

for an offence under section 54(a) of the Poisons, Opium and

Dangerous Drugs Ordinance as amended by Act No. 13 of 1984 in the

Magistrate Court of Neg ambo in case No 156/15.

The position of the 4th Suspect above name was that the 1st Suspect

was arrested at the departure gate of Bandaranayke International

Airport when the baggage of said Suspect who was to fly of Abu

Dhabi was detected with several parcels containing a substance which

was suspected to be Heroin. Upon interrogating the 1 st Suspect it was

revealed that he was acting on the instructions of a friend by the name

ofRamesh, who was based in Abu Dhabi. The 4th Suspect was arrested

when the 2nd and 3rd Suspects who were allergy acting on the

instruction of said Ramesh, met the 4th Suspect in the guise of handing

over the parcel which was alleged to have been given to the 1 st

Suspect. The Petitioner submitted that the 4th Suspect has been

incarcerated since 6th of Feb 2015. It was also submitted that the

Petitioner made her 1 st application for bail in May 2015 to the High

Court of Negambo in terms of Section 83 (1) of the Poisons, Opium

and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance Act No 17 of 1929 as amended by

Act No 13 of 1984. This application for bail was subsequently refused

by the Learned High Court Judge. Further the Petitioner made her 2nd

application for bail in the High Court of Neg ambo in terms of section

83(1) of the aforesaid Act which was subsequently withdrawn by her

on 30109/2015.

The Petitioner further submitted that she filed a revision application

against the refusal of a 1 st application for bail to the High Court of

Negambo to the Court of Appeal which was subsequently withdrawn

by the Petitioner. Again she made a 3rd application for bail in October

2015 to the High Court of Negambo and draw the attention of the

Learned High Court Judge, that,

a) No Heroin was found in the possession or control of the

said suspect.

b) The only evidence against the suspect is a mere claim

made by bother suspects that the 4th suspect who was

seeking bail was the end receiver of the parcel containing

the heroin.

c) The 4th Suspect was merely an innocent victim of

circumstances and did not have any intention or

knowledge on the alleged acts of other suspects.

d) The 4th suspect has no precious convictions or any

criminal record to cast any reasonable suspicion on him.

e) The Petitioner also submitted many documents to court

pertaining to the said suspect to prove the existence of

exceptional circumstances to justify the application for

bail.

However the said bail application was also refuse by the Learned

High Court Judge by his order dated 03112/2015 on the basis inter alia

that there are no sufficient grounds provided by the Petitioner which

warrant granting of bail to the Suspect. Being aggrieved by the

aforesaid order of the Learned High Court Judge dated 03/12120015

the Petitioner filed this application on the basis that the aforesaid order

is illegal, wrongful and contrary to the law and/or unreasonable for

anyone or more of the stated in para 13 (a) to (i) of the petition and

also had submitted that the Learned High Court Judge has seriously

erred and misdirected herself by dismissing the application of the

Petitioner without considering the grounds that were urged by the

Petitioner as exceptional which warrant granting of bail to the suspect.

The Petitioner had stated the grounds in para 14 as exceptional

circumstances which warrant the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction

of this court. The main grounds on which is order sought to be revised

are as follows:

The long period of remand that the suspect has spent,

a) The suspect has been in custody for almost 2 years,

b) The long incarceration is totally contrary to the well

excepted principle of 'presumption of innocence' that

operates in favour of the suspect.

During the arguments the Counsels ofthe Respondents took up many

preliminary objections. 1st and foremost the preliminary objections of

lack of Locus Standi has been made by the Respondent that the

Petitioner has no Locus Standi to make the instant revision

application. It was contended that a person who calls a said wife of

7

the suspect as make these application and that there is no document or

other material to prove that the Petitioner is the wife of the suspect. It

was held that revision application can be maintain only by the

aggrieved party in the case of Alwis V. Wedamulla 1997 3 SLR 417

and in Senathilake Vs. Attorney General 98 (3) SLR 290 290 that

the Petitioner who is the father of the Accused, has no Locus Standi

to maintain a revision application. M.M. Sonali Fernando V. AG

CA(PHC) APN 144/2007 it has been clearly laid down that no one

else other than the Accused himself can maintain application to vary

a sentence imposed in respect of him.

In the case of Savarimuttu Tavamani v. Attorney General CA

(PHC) APN 37/2014 it was held that the mother of the Accused has

no Locus Standi to institute this revision application. In the vary recent

Divisional Bench Judgement of CA 101113 it was decided that the

suspect himself should file the revision application. Under the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance at Section 83( 1) bail

will be granted only under exceptional circumstances.

It was further stated by way of objections by the Respondent that the

Petitioner has failed to appeal against the order when he had right of

appeal and why court should exercise revisional powers in his favour.

It was submitted that court should dismiss the Petitioners application

in limine for want of exceptional circumstances. Further it was

submitted that the Petitioners status has changed. The indictment has

been dispatched to the Negombo High Court and the status of the

Petitioner has changed from the suspect to the Accused.

Therefore the prOVISIons of Section 195 (d) of the Criminal

Procedure Code has come in to play. The Petitioner should first seek

bail from The High Court which step the Petitioner has to take.

Accordingly, the Respondent moved that the Petition of the

Petitioner be dismiss with cost.

When considering a Locus Standi of the Petitioner we find that a

person who calls herself as the wife of the suspect has made this

application no document or other material has been tendered to court

to prove that she is the legal wife. As such we are of the view as the

9

Petitioner has not proved that she is the wife of the 4th Suspect.

Therefore as the Petitioners has failed to prove her Locus Standi we

do not consider that we should go in to the merits of this application.

Hence we dismiss this application without cost.
