Judgment

s. Thurairaja PC J

The accused appellant D.M. Dasanayake was originally indicted under Section 296 of

the Penal Code for committing the murder of Don. Padmasiri Samarajeewa. After the

completion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge found him not guilty for

murder and found him guilty for culpable homicide not amounting to murder

punishable under Section 297 of Penal Code and sentenced to 12 years Rigorous

Imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs. 10000 in default 6 months simple

imprisonment.

The accused appellant being aggrieved with term of the sentence preferred an

appeal to this Court.

Both Counsel for the appellant and Deputy Solicitor General filed written submissions

and made oral submissions too.

As per the Prosecution witnesses, the accused, deceased and witnesses were living at

Meepilimana village in the same vicinity. On the night around 9.30 pm on 1 r h

October 2002, stones were pelted on the house of prosecution witness T.M. Gamini

Tennakoon. The family members of the witness raised cries and neighbours gathered

and searched around. They thought it was a thief and having heard noise of dried

leaves at the jungle, which was in extent of an acre, the people tried to enter the

forest. The deceased had approached the accused who was in the jungle. It was at

this situation when the accused had stabbed the deceased on his chest with a knife

he possessed. Eye witnesses were available to the incident. After stabbing the

deceased, the accused had come out of the jungle and threatened others with death

and prevented being apprehended. There was no contradiction or omission marked

at the trial, further there is no contradiction per se or inter se. After the prosecution

case was closed the learned High Court Judge called for the defence of the

accused who exercised his rights by remaining silent.

The learned trial Judge after giving reasons found the accused guilty for a

lesser offence namely culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Both

counsels made submissions, considering those mitigating factors the Trial Judge

imposed 12 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.10,OOO/= in default six

month simple imprisonment.

The Counsel for the accused-appellant submits that the sentence imposed is

excessive and term be reduced. Further he filed an affidavit from the daughter of the

appellant that she had followed a degree in Bachelor of Ayurveda Medicine Survey

(BAMS) at Ayurveda institute of University of Kelaniya. Therefore, she wishes to

have her father for her convocation which was to be held after one year of internship.

The DSG who is representing the AG is vehemently objects to giving any

concession. He further submits that considering the nature of the injury

namely deep stabbing injuries on to chest which resulted an instantaneous

death clearly shows the intention of the accused. Further he had not submitted

any mitigating circumstances to reduce a charge from murder to culpable

homicide not amounting to murder. The DSG further submits that the AG

preferred an appeal regarding the conviction but it was dismissed on technical

ground. The Counsel for the appellant confirms that fact.

The deceased was 40 years old and was un armed at the time of the death.

He had not gone in search of a quarrel. When the villagers were going in search

of the thief/person who pelted stones the deceased also joined them and

confronted the accused who was hiding in the jungle.

Further this Court takes serious note that the accused was armed with a knife

which is not a tool of his trade. There is no evidence that the accused suffered any

injury. The deceased had five injuries one of which is the stab wound on the

('A Qr;12012 JUDGMENT Page 3 of 4

chest. The death was due to the stab injury. Further the deceased was found dead

upon admission to the hospital.

After carefully considering all factors placed before the trial Judge, including the

fact that the daughter of the accused was studying at the university, he had

imposed the sentence above mentioned on the accused-appellant. We see no

reason to interfere with the said sentence. In fact considering the evidence, the

accused appellant is fortunate to get such a lenient sentence. Accordingly we

dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction and sentence.

Since the accused appellant has been incarcerated from the date of conviction, we

order the Prison Authority to implement the sentence from the date of conviction

namely, 05/07/2012.

Appeal Dismissed.
