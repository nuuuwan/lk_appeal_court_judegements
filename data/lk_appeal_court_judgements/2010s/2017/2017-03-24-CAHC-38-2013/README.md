P.R. Walgama, J

The instant appeal IS arISIng In pursuant to a

conviction of the Accused - Appellant for the murder of

one Ramaiya Paramajothi, on or about 05.05.1994. After

a protracted trial the Learned High Court Judge

convicted the Accused - Appellant for the said charge of

murder and imposed a death sentence accordingly. Being

aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence the

1

-.

Accused - Appellant, appealed to this court for the

vacation of the same.

As per indictment the Accused - Appellant, (the 1st Accused)

and his father Arumugam Thangavelu, (the 2nd Accused)

were charged for committing murder of Ramaia Paramajothi

punishable under Section 296, read along with section 32 of

the Penal code.

At the conclusion of the trial the Learned High Court

Judge acquitted the 2nd Accused and convicted the 1st

Accused - Appellant of the above charge of murder and

imposed a death penalty on him.

The prosecution has unfurled the following facts;

That on this fateful day the deceased was stabbed

and was lying fallen near the line room when witness

J ayaram (PW 1) saw the deceased, and had rushed to

the place where the deceased was lying, and when

questioned as to what

uttered that; "Thangavelu

me with a knife." The

happened the deceased had

Dhobi and his son attacked

testimony of this witness In

court was that the said Thangavelu Dhobi has three

sons and Thangavelu Pathmanadan IS his eldest son,

and he was identified as the 1 st Accused standing

In the dock. Nevertheless it IS alleged by the

counsel for the Accused - Appellant that the said

witness has deviated from the above verSlOn and

stated that the deceased uttered that "Thangavelu

2

Dhobi and his son attacked me with a knife."

But

it

In the statement In the non . . summary Inquny

IS said that this witness has stated that

"Thangavelu Dhobi and his son Padmanadan attacked

me with a knife,"

The bone of contention and the pnmary ground

of appeal IS that there has been con tradictory

verSIOns In the dying declaration made by the deceased

to this witness. Nevertheless it IS seen from the

verSIOns of two witnesses what the deceased had

uttered and implicated Thangavelu Dhobi and his son

Pathmanadan. According to the version of one witness

the deceased has not mentioned the name of the

Tangavelu Dhobi's son namely, Pathmanadan.

Therefore it IS contended

Accused - Appellant that the

sustained SInce the evidence

testified In

to

made

that

the

by

the

court has gIven

dying declaration

the deceased. But

Learned High

and convicted

by the counsel for the

conviction cannot be

of the witnesses who

different statements as

have been

to mention

after the

the statements made by the

perpetrator of as to the culprit or the

the alleged cnme it IS established that the Thangavelu

Dhobi's son has committed the crime. It IS been noted

that In the dying declaration no other outsider's name

was mentioned. If there was

extent it would have been a

a discrepancy to that

difficult task to the

Learned High Court Judge to enter a conviction

against the Accused - Appellant. As

there IS no doubt as to

observed by this court

the identity of the

culprit who committed the heinous cnme.

Besides the Counsel for the Accused - Appellant had

alleged that the Learned High Court Judge has

dealt with the recovery under section 27 of the

Evidence Ordinance and had arrived at conclusion

that the Accused - Appellant's complicity In the

commIssIOn of the cnme.

has

the correct perspective and accepted

the

statement and had attached sanctity to the

dying declaration made by the deceased. It

was observed by the Learned Trial Judge, that

the defence had not suggested that the deceased

had not made a dying declaration. Then the fact

remruns

wherein

that

transpired. Further it has

Learned Trial Judge that

suggested that the deceased

to make any statement. Therefore In the

a position

said back

I I !I! 11

drop it IS abundantly clear that the evidence of the

above witnesses remained unimpeached as to the

material particulars.

It IS also being observed that the witness Jayaram,

has made a statement to the police within a

short period as to the alleged incident of stabbing

and dying declaration. Therefore it IS seen these

witnesses had proved the clinching circumstances against

the Accused - Appellant.

Further there IS no allegation of concoction of the

genesIs or the ongln of the alleged incident. The

above witness's statement was spontaneous.

Thus taking overall VIew of the matter, we are

of the considered oplnlOn that the finding of

guilt recorded against the Accused - Appellant by

the Learned High Court Judge IS unexceptionable

and does not warrant any interference.

Accordingly appeal IS dismissed.

K.K. Wickramasinghe, J I agree.
