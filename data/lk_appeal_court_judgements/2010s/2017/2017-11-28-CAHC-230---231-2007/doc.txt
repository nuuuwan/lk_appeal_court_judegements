s. Thurairaja PC J

The accused appellants were indicted at the High Court of Colombo on following

charges;

1. On or about 24.02.1997 the 1st accused being a Police Officer did solicit a

gratification of Rs. 5000/= from Ratnasiri Jayasena (the complainant), an

offence punishable under Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act (as amended).

2. At the same time and place and in the course of the same transaction the 1st

accused did accept a gratification of Rs. 5000/= from the complainant, an

offence punishable under Section 19(c) of the Bribery Act (as amended).

3. At the same time and place in the course of the same transaction the 2nd

accused aided and abetted the 1st accused to commit the offence in count [1],

an offence punishable under Section 25(2) read with Section 19(c) of the

Bribery Act (as amended).

4. At the same time and place in the course of the same transaction the 2nd

accused aided and abetted the 1st accused to commit the offence in count[2],

an offence punishable under Section 25(2) read with Section 19(c) of the

Bribery Act (as amended).

Both accused were convicted after trial and were sentenced as follows;

Count [1] - Four years rigorous imprisonment (RI)

CA 230-231/2007 JUDGMENT Page 2 of9

Count [4] - Four years R.I

Rs. 5000 fine with a default term of 1 year R.I

Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently.

Being aggrieved with the said conviction accused appellants had preferred an appeal

on the following grounds:

I. The High Court Judge has not complied with Section 283(1} of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No.15 of 1979 (as amended).

II. The defence of the accused appellants were not considered.

III. Identification of the 1st accused was in doubt.

IV. There was no evidence against that the 2nd accused appellant.

As per the available materials, the prosecution's case is as follows:

On the 24th February 1997, the complainant P.W. Ratnasiri Jayasena and G.

Premadasa Samson returned from Singapore after a business trip. The complainant

brought some electronic items and Mr. Samson brought some spare parts for his

vehicle. Both came in the same vehicle from the airport to Dehiwala. At the

Peliyagoda Japan Friendship Bridge (commonly known as the Victoria Bridge or

Kelaniya Bridge) they were stopped by the police at the checkpoint, it is of common

knowledge that during that period the roads were blocked due to security threats

and police check points were- set up in many places including the above mentioned

place. They were stopped at the checkpoint by the 1st accused who was a Police

Sergeant and the vehicle was subject to search. After the search they found that the

items in the vehicle should be subject to customs duty. The complainant had

informed the accused that he had paid Rs. 1450 as duty, but the accused was of the

view that amount was insufficient. 1st accused was seen talking to his superior the 2nd

accused, who was a Sub Inspector and in charge of that checkpoint. After a delay

they were asked to pay another Rs. 5000, the complainant took the money from his

relative who was in the van and gave it to the 1st accused, who kept the money in the

cap and wore it.

CA 230-231/2007 JUDGMENT P;lgp ~ nfq

At the time they were detained, the complainant had clearly taken note of the 1st

accused and his number tag (not written). Thereafter he had complained to the

Police Head Quarters even though he says he complained to the ClO, it appears the

complaint was made to the Special Investigation Unit. The 1st accused had a number

tag in his uniform and he was identified with that number. The second accused was

an officer who didn't carry a number therefore he was subject to an identification

parade and he was identified by the witness.

The 15\ 2nd and 4th grounds of appeal can be considered together. Therefore, I wish

to consider the 3rd ground of appeal primarily which was said that the identification

of the 1 st accused was not established.

At the very outset it should be noted that there is no motive established or

suggested to the witness that he made a malicious allegation against these two

Police Officers. Considering the facts before the court I do not see that these

witnesses will benefit in any way in making an allegation against the two accused. It

is an established fact that the two Police Officers were attached to the Grandpas

Police Station and it was well documented that they were assigned to man the check

point on the said date and time. The defence counsel was trying to establish that the

Army also participated In the checkpoint but it was categorically denied by the

official witnesses.

It is an established fact the complainant and other witnesses returned from

Singapore on the said night, but the checkpoint vehicle register does not contain an

entry of this vehicle on which the witnesses travelled was subject to search. Three

witnesses who gave evidence were not contradicted on the fact that their vehicle was

stopped at the said checkpoint.

The witnesses say that the vehicle was stopped for a considerable period. It is noted

that the prosecution witness Ratnasiri Jayasena says it was nearly an hour but the

other witness S.A. Chandrasena says about 15 minutes and witness G.P Samson says

they were kept until they paid the money. The fact remains that the vehicle was

CA 230-231/2007 JUDGMENT Page 4 of9

stopped and subjected to a search. Now the question is why the accused have not

entered the registration number of the vehicle. It may be 15 minutes or 1 hour but in

the late hours of the night there are minimum number of vehicles on the road; even

though it was dark the spot light in the check point makes a clear vision on any

person who stays for a short period. The witness had told the 1 st accused that he

knows the DIG but the 1 st accused after consulting with the 2nd acclaimed had told

them that they will be taken to the Police Station and they can sort the issue there.

It is on evidence that the complaint was made to the Police Head Quarters and

inquiry was held by the CID/ SIU. There after the matter was referred to the Bribery

Commission. Since the identification of the 2nd accused was not clear the

investigators of the CID and Bribery Commission held an identification parade to

identify the 2nd accused. There is no challenge thrown at the identification parade.

The 2nd accused was duly identified at the said parade.

The prosecution witness Jayasena had clearly identified 1st and 2nd accused in the

open court while giving evidence. The counsel for the accused appellants submits

that this is a dock identification and it cannot be accepted.

Dock identification is normally described as a witness identifying the accused for the

1st time in open court at the time of the trial. In this case there was a complaint to the

Police Head Quarters and an investigation was conducted, after gathering sufficient

materials and evidence they referred it to the relevant authority namely the Bribery

Commission to take the necessary course of action. The Bribery Commission after

satisfying themselves preferred an indictment.

Considering the evidence, the identification of the 1st accused was not a passing

glimpse, it appears genuine, a Police Officer in the midnight taking money from a

person, keeping it under his cap invites any person to observe it carefully and make a

mental note. In this case the witness made 2 statements to the ClD as well as the

Bribery Commission and those were with the defence. It was not questioned about

whether the identification number was mentioned or not to the investigators.

Author E.R.S.R. Coomaraswamy gave his idea on the topic of Dock Identification in

his Law of Evidence Volume (1), where he stated the following:

Hlf a witness knew the accused earlier and he recognised him, the

identification is more satisfactory than if he dId not know him earlier, in

which case an Identification parade is almost a sine qua non. If this is

not carried out the identification becomes a "first time" identification in

court or a dock Identification. This practice is undesirable and unsafe

and should be avoided, if possible. If the accused had refused to take

part in an Identification parade, he runs the risk of dock identification. "

[Emphasis Added]

The concept of dock identification was broadly discussed in Kokmaduwa Mudalige

Premachandra and Two Others Vs Attorney General (CA 39-41/1997) where

Justice F.N.D Jayasuriya held that:

"Justice Wijesundara in Gunarathna Banda's case (an unreported

decision) but which is referred to the author E.R.S.R Coomaraswamy,

Law of Evidence Volume (1), has referred to a series of English and

foreign judgments where the view has been expressed that it is against

prudence and wisdom to proceed against an Accused person in a

criminal case on mere dock identification. Justice Wijesundara has

followed this development of the law in foreign jurisdictions and

recommended to the trial judges that they should adopt this rule which

prevails in foreign jurisdiction. In the circumstances we set aside the

findings conviction and sentence, imposed on third accused appellant

and acquit the third accused."

In O.W Wasantha and three others Vs A.G (CA 179/2006), Justice Ranjith Silva

held that:

"On the issue of identification evidence, the judge must give accurate

directions regarding the identification evidence and direct the jury that

CA 230-231/2007 JUDGMENT Page 6of9

they must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt to the accuse. If no

identification parade was held and the accused was a stranger, the judge

must caution the jury that the identification may become a mere dock

identification and must direct the jury that the omission to hold and

identification parade may be an important omission for the purpose."

[Emphasis Added]

Considering the above facts and the case laws I find that the 1st accused appellant

was clearly identified by the witnesses. Therefore, this ground of appeal fails on its

own merits.

The other grounds of appeal are amalgamated and considered together. Perusing

the judgment of the learned trial judge; I find that it comes within the meaning of

Section 283(1) of CCPA. The judge had considered the charge, ingredients of the

charge, evidence submitted by the prosecution and the defence's version was

considered. The judgment is dated and signed by the trial judge, there after it was

pronounced in open court. The counsel for the 1st and 2nd accused made submissions

in mitigation. After considering the submission the Learned Trial Judge imposed the

sentence and fine. It is noted that the learned High Court Judge had not imposed the

maximum sentence provided by the law. He had given a lenient sentence on the

accused appellants. I do not see any illegality or impropriety in the sentence.

Considering the contents of the judgment, I find that the trial judge had considered

the ingredients of the charge and analysed the evidence submitted by prosecution.

At the same time, he had considered the defence put forward by the accused

through the prosecution~ The 1st accused remained silent; the 2nd accused made a

dock statement and denied the allegation against him. The learned Trial Judge had

not drawn any adverse inference against these two accused persons. He had

considered all the evidence in a holistic approach and come to a conclusion that the

charges are proved against the respective accused beyond reasonable doubt.

CA 230-231/2007 JUDGMENT Page 7of9

We perused the entire evidence available before us and find that the judgment of the

learned trial judge is based on the evidence before him. One cannot expect the trial

judge to write a thesis on a case before him, the judicially trained minded judge will

spell out what he recognises as important in a case which does not mean that he had

not considered all relevant facts and laws. This court is mindful of the workings of the

original courts.

Considering all the available materials, I find that the involvement of the 2nd accused

appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. He had been identified at an

identification parade, he was the Officer-in-Charge, he had been seen instructing

/ordering the 1st accused appellant in this wrongful act. Hence, I do not see any

reason to interfere with the finding of the Learned Trial Judge.

All grounds of appeal fail on its own merits. The counsels for the accused appellants

pleaded with the court to show leniency by imposing state cost on the accused

appellants.

We are possessed of the submission made by the counsels. The offence committed is

serious in nature. The two accused appellants are Police Officers and the period in

which this incident occurred was the peak of civil war, where the Colombo city was

under severe threats from terrorist. The Police Officers who were entrusted with the

duty of protecting civilians had a big responsibility placed upon their shoulders, as

there have been many terrorists' attacks within the city, even with all the heavy

checkpoints. Therefore, the accused appellants cannot be shown any leniency for the

offence they have committed. Anyhow we are mindful that the offence was

committed on the 24th February 1997 which is more than 20 years ago.

The court duly observes the delay caused by the accused appellant's in the trial but

these delays are inherent to the system. Therefore, giving the benefit to the accused

appellants this court decides to impose the following sentence:

CA 230-231/2007 JUDGMENT Page 8of9

,

a) 1st accused appellant's conviction was affirmed on the 1st and 2nd charge

and we impose 1-year rigorous imprisonment to run concurrently and

suspend the said sentence for a period of 7 years. In addition, we impose a

fine of Rs. 5000 on each count in default 3 months simple imprisonment

(Default sentence will operate concurrently).

b) 2nd accused appellant's conviction is affirmed on the 3rd and 4th counts and

we impose 1-year rigorous imprisonment to run concurrently and suspend

the sentence for a period of 7 years. In addition, we impose a fine of Rs.

5000 on each count in default 3 months simple imprisonment (Default

sentence will operate concurrently).

Subject to variation in the sentence appeal is dismissed.
