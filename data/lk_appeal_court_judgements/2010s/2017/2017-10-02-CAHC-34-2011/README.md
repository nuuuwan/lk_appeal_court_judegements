The appellants were indicted in the High Court of Batticaloa under

section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code for the murder of one

Kandaiya Navaratnam and after trial all three appellants were convicted

for murder and were sentenced to death.

The only ground of appeal raised by the appellant's learned

counsel is that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that there

was high antecedent probability of death resulting from the injuries

caused, in the light of the fact that the deceased died seventeen days

after the injuries caused by the appellants.

The Judicial Medical Officer in 'his evidence has stated that there

were two surgeries performed on the abdomen of the deceased. He has

described that the deceased had been stabbed with sharp weapons and

that these weapons were soiled with pathogens which entered the

abdominal cavity when injuries are caused with such weapons, and that

pathogens caused septicemia as they have a very high capability of

multiplying within a short period of time.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General argued that the evidence of

the Judicial Medical Officer when carefully considered as a whole strongly

implies that there is a very high degree of probability that in the ordinary

course of nature, septicemia setting in on the deceased as a results of

the stab injuries inflicted by the appellants resulted in death.

The learned counsel for the appellants argued that the Judicial

Medical Officer in his evidence stated that in normal conditions the

deceased would have died within 24 to 48 hours after the injuries (pages

119 to 123 of the brief).

The learned counsel for the second and third appellants referring

to section 294 of the Penal Code argued that the appellants did not intend

to cause the death of the deceased. When one examines the injuries

caused to the deceased it clearly shows that the appellants had the

requisite murderous intention at the time of attacking the deceased. The

Judicial Medical Officer had observed that the deceased had been

stabbed with sharp weapons and that weapons had been soiled with

pathogens which entered the abdominal cavity which caused the

septicemia. He has further stated that septicemia is a serious condition

that causes the death of a patient even when admitted to a hospital.

3

The Post Mortem Report clearly given two causes of death namely.

1. Death due to multiple cut injuries in the scalp counting

multiple fracture in the skull causing extra Dural

Hemorrhage.

2. Perforation of stomach and contaminated omenlu

pathogens and septicemia due to stab injuries to the

stomach.

The judgments cited by the appellant's counsel namely Mendis vs

The Queen 54 NLR 177 and the case reported in CA no. 32 of 1998

decided on 06/07/1998 have no relevance to the instant case. In Mendis

vs The Queen the cause of death is toxemia where the injury has been

described as follows .

... A punctured wound 3/gth inch in diameter by quarter inch deep over

the upper right shin three inches below the knee with underlying

fracture of both bones of leg. There was blistering and black dis-

coloration over the whole front and sides of right leg and swelling of

the right foot and knee ....

When the evidence of the Judicial Medical Officer is taken as a

whole it clearly shows that there is a high degree of probability that the

death of the deceased was due to the injuries caused by the appellants.

" '

Section 294 (3) of the Penal Code states for the constitution of the

offence of murder there must be material and media which would enable

the judge to hold that in the ordinary course of nature the injuries inflicted

were sufficient to cause death as opposed to mere likelihood. The Judicial

Medical Officer has testified that the injuries (page 122 of the brief) are

sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the

deceased. The learned trial judge has evaluated the evidence placed

before his and arrived at his finding. Therefore I am not inclined to agree

with the argument of the learned counsel for appellants, and set aside a

well considered judgment.

The judgment dated 23/05/2011 is affirmed. Appeal dismissed.
