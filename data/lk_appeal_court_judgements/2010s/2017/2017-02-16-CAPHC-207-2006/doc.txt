H. C. J. Madawala, J

This appeal has been preferred to set aside the Order dated 23/04/2004

of the Learned Primary Court Judge of Elpitiya dated 23/04/2004 revised

by the learned High Court Judge of Balapitiya by order dated 2611 0/2006

and the possession of the land in dispute was granted to the First

Respondent Petitioner- Respondent. The instant appeal has been preferred

therefrom.

On 09/02/2016 when this matter came up for argument. Heard both

counsel's in support and in opposition of their respective cases. Both parties

were directed to file their written submissions on or before

16/0112017.Judgement reserved for 02/02/2017 and was postponed for

13/02/2017. We have considered the arguments and written submissions of

both parties.

The main point of contest was in relation that as to what was the land

in dispute in Deed No.38708 attested by A. Sri Wijeyananda Notary

Public dated 20102/1992. It was submitted that the First Respondent

never challenged at any forum the said deed No; 38708 does not relate

to the land in dispute. It was also submitted that documents commencing

from pages 72,73 and 74 of the appeal brief also shows the possession

of the 2nd Respondent in relation to the land in dispute.

4

The documents commencmg from Page 75, 77 and 79 are also

important, especially the document in page 77 cuts across the Learned

High Court Judges conclusion. That there is no reference to the growth

of cinnamon on the land in dispute and that the 1 st Respondents version

of the story is more plausible that only tea is grown on the land in

dispute. The learned Provincial High Court Judge has held that none of

the supporting affidavits produced on behalf of the 2nd Respondent it

is mentioned that cinnamon is cultivated in the land in dispute along

with tea.

The documents at pages 81,82,83,84, and 85 ofthe brief which are receipts

received by the 2nd Respondent for the sale of tea leaves obtained from

the land in dispute. Attention of Court is drawn to the name of the land

in such receipts to wit "Jambugahakanda Kabella" The contention of

the 2nd Respondent was that the land in dispute is called

"Jambugahakanda Kebella" and does not carry any other name.

In Ramalingam Vs. Thangarajah (1982) 2 S.L.R. 693 the Honourable

Supreme Court Justice Sharvananda held as follows,

"That person is entitled to possession until he is evicted by due

process of law. A Judge should therefore in an inquiry under part

VII of the aforesaid Act, confine himself to the question of actual

5

possession on the date of filing of the information except in a case

where a person who had been in possession of the land had been

dispossessed within a period of two months immediately before the

date of the information. He is not to decide any question of title or

right to possession of the parties to the land. Evidence bearing on

title can be considered only when the evidence as to possession is

clearly balanced and the presumption of possession which flows

from title may tilt the balance in favour of the owner and help in

deciding the question of possession. "

It was submitted to court that it is an admitted fact that as of the date of

filing of the information that it was the 2nd Respondent who was in

possession of the land in dispute and it was further submitted that the

1 st Respondent has not proved dispossession within a period of two

months immediately before the date of the information. Furthermore,

although it is popularly stated that evidence in relation to title and right of

possession ofthe land in dispute cannot be considered in a Section 66 action,

still in a situation when the evidence as to possession is clearly balanced title

is important as the presumption of possession will benefit the party who

brings in evidence oftitle to the Section 66 action. In this regard only the 2nd

Respondent has produced any document to show the title of the 2nd

Respondent in relation to the land in dispute ( Vide Leisa V. Simon (2002)

\

1 SLR 148 which held that "The moment title is proved the right to possess

it, is presumed).

It was also submitted that the learned High Court Judge ofBalapitiya

cannot go into the Elpitiya Primary Court Judges decision and state that

it is wrong. This is because unlike in an appeal the remedy of revision

cannot be invoked to decide whether a decision is legal or illegal.

It was further submitted that no exceptional circumstances have been

divulged by the pt Respondent to revise the Primary Court Judge's order.

Accordingly, he moved that the reliefs prayed for by the 2nd Respondent-

Respondent- Appellant in his appeal be granted.

The 15t Respondent-Petitioner aggrieved by the order of the Learned

Magistrate filed a revision application in the High Court of Balapitiya

bearing No. 588/04. It was submitted that the 2nd Respondent-Respondent-

Appellant had not properly identified the land in dispute. It was evident from

the following facts, by document marked "R1" (at page 60 to 63 of the brief)

the 2nd Respondent's position was that the land in dispute is, ~t5J~ 06)@o)

favour of the Respondent and set aside the judgment of the Learned

Magistrate dated 23/04/2004 by holding that,

The judgment of the Learned High Court Judge is tenable in law. We find

that the Learned High Court Judge very carefully considering and analyzing

the material and documents placed before court arrived at the above

findings.

The contention of the 2nd Respondent-Respondent was that the pt

Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant has not averred any exceptional

circumstances. However we find that the Respondent adduced exceptional

circumstances the Respondent in his petition to the Learned High Court

Judge has averred 12( q) - 12(C), that the Respondent had averred the

exceptional circumstances.

~.

Hence as there is an illegality in the Learned Magistrate order a Revision

Application can be filed. Further we hold that there is no merit in this appeal.

Accordingly we affirm the judgment ofthe Learned High Court Judge dated

26/1 0/2005 and dismiss this appeal with cost of Rs.l 0,0001-
