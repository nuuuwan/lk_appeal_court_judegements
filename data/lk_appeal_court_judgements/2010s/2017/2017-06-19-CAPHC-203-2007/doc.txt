This is an appeal from the High Court of Polonnaruwa.

The Applicant Respondent Respondent, (hereinafter sometimes called

and referred to as the Respondent) as the Competent Authority, instituted

action in the Magistrate Court of Polonnaruwa under the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act to eject the Respondent Petitioner

Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Appellant)

from a state land. After inquiry, the learned Magistrate issued the order

for ejectment against the Appellant. Being dissatisfied with the order the

Appellant moved in revision in the Provincial High Court of Polonnaruwa

where the application was dismissed. This appeal is from the said order of

the High Court.

The Appellant raised a question of law that the Respondent is not a

'Competent Authority' who can file action under the State land

(Recovery of Possession) Act.

The Respondent made this application as the Resident Business Manager

of the 'B' Division of the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority and as the

Additional District Secretary of Ampara/BadullalPolonnaruwa.

The section 23 of the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka Act No. 23 of

1979 amended by Act No. 59 of 1993 endorses that the State Land

(Recovery of Possession) Act applies to special areas and the employs of

the Authority, who were authorized in that behalf, by the Authority, can

exercise the powers under the Act. The subsection (1) and (3) of section

23 reads thus;

22. (1) The written laws for the time being specified in Schedule B

hereto shall have effect in every Special Area subject to the

modification that it shall be lawful for the Authority to exercise and

discharge in such area any of the powers or functions vested by

any such written law in any authority, officer or person in like

manner as though the reference in any such written law to the

authority, officer or person empowered to exercise or discharge

such powers or functions included a reference to the Authority.

(2) .....

(3) Any power or function which the Authority is authorized

by subsection (1) to exercise or discharge, may be exercised or

discharged on behalf of the Authority by any director of the

Authority or by any employee of the Authority as is authorized in

that behalf by the Authority.

The schedule 'B' includes the State Land (Recovery of Possession)

Act. In his application for ejectment the Respondent states that he is the

competent authority.

The Respondent acts in a dual capacity. In addition to be the Resident

Business Manager, he is the Additional District Secretary for the districts

of Ampara, Badulla and Polonnaruwa. Under section 18 of the State Land

Recovery of Possession) Act the Government Agent is the competent

authority and that expression includes the Additional Government Agent

too. The section reads

18. In this Act, unless the Context otherwise requires-

"competent authority" used in relation to any land means

the Government Agent, an Additional Government Agent or

an Assistant Government Agent of the district in which the

land is situated and, includes ..... .

Therefore the Respondent as the Additional District Secretary also has the

authority to institute action under the Act.

Under these circumstances, the argument that the 1 st Respondent is not

the competent authority, fails.

The scope of the inquiry under section 9 of the Act is very limited. Unless

the occupier cannot establish that he is in occupation under a valid permit

or on a written authority given by the state the Magistrate has to issue the

order for ejectment.

Muhandiram V Chairman, No. 111, Janatha Estate Development

Board [1992J 1 Sri L R 110

In an inquiry under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act,

the onus is on the person summoned to establish his possession or

occupation that it is possessed or occupied upon a valid permit or

I I I !

other written authority of the State granted according to any

written law. If this burden is not discharged, the only option open

to the Magistrate is to order ejectment.

In the present case the Appellant has failed to establish that he IS m

occupation of the State Land under a valid permit or on a written

authority. Therefore I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the

learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly the appeal dismissed.
