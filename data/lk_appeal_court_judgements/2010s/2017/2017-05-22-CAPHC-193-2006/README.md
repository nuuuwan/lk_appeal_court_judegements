This is an appeal from the High Court of Colombo.

The Applicant Respondent Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

called and referred to as the Respondent) instituted action in the

Magistrate Court of Mt.Laviniya under the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act against the Respondent Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter

sometimes called and referred to as the Appellant). After inquiry the

learned Magistrate issued the ejectment order. Being aggrieved, the

Appellant moved in revision in the High Court of Colombo without

success. This appeal is there from.

The scope of inquiry under the section 9 of the Act is very limited.

The party noticed has to establish that he/she is occupying the land on a

permit or a valid written authority issued under law. The competency of

the Competent Authority or the opinion of the Competent Authority

cannot be called in question.

The Court of Appeal held in the case of Kandaiah v. Abeykoon

1986 Vol. 3 CALR 141 that the opinion of the competent authority is

conclusive. Further in the following judgment it was held that the opinion

of the Competent Authority is conclusive.

F arook v. Gunawardane Government Agent Amparai [1980] 1 Sri

LR243

The structure of the Act would also make it appear that where the

competent authority had formed the opinion that any land is State

land, even the Magistrate is not competent to question his opinion.

Alternate relief is given by section 12 which empowers any person

4

claiming to be the owner of a land to institute action against the

State for the vindication of his title within 6 months from the date

of the order of ejectment and section 13 is to the effect that where

action is instituted by a person, if a decision is made in favour of

that person, he will be entitled to recover reasonable compensation

for the damage sustained by reason of his having been compelled

to deliver possession of such land.

The inquiry under section 9 of the Act is limited to establishing

that the person noticed is occupying the land on a valid permit or a

written authority issued under law.

Muhandiram v. Chairman, No. 111, Janatha Estate Development

Board [1992]1 Sri L.R. 110

In an inquiry under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act,

the onus is on the person summoned to establish his possession or

occupation that it is possessed or occupied upon a valid permit or

other written authority of the State granted according to any

written law. If this burden is not discharged, the only option open

to the Magistrate is to order ejectment.

In the present case the Appellant does not produce any permit or a

written authority where he is permitted to occupy the land.

The Appellant's contention is that he was in occupation of the land

in dispute for more than 20 years. No person can claim prescriptive rights

against the State on state lands. On the hand even if the title to the land in

dispute is disputed by the party noticed, the remedy is to act under section

12 of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act, not to challenge the

application to eject in the Magistrate Court.

Under these circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the

findings of the learned Magistrate or the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

I agree.
