L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

The Petitioner Appellant IS the registered owner of the vehicle

bearing registration no. 227 - 1329 which was used for the transportation of

cattle without a valid permit. The driver of the vehicle was charged under

Animals Act for transporting cattle without a permit and under Prevention

of Cruelty to the Animals Ordinance. The driver pleaded guilty and was

sentenced.

The Petitioner Appellant (the Appellant) being the registered owner

made an application to Court to release the vehicle to him. The absolute

owner informed Court that he has no objection in releasing the vehicle to the

registered owner. The Appellant gave evidence in the Magistrate Court. The

learned Magistrate after inquiry confiscated the vehicle. The Appellant

moved in revision in the High Court of Kurunegala against the order. This

appeal is on the dismissal of the said revision application.

The Appellant was represented by a Counsel in this Court but at the

hearing, the Appellant was absent and unrepresented. The Counsel for the

absolute owner had informed Court that he is not challenging the order of

the learned Magistrate or the learned High Court Judge. Learned DSG was

heard on behalf of the state.

The Appellant has failed to establish that he has taken all precautions

to prevent the vehicle being used for illegal purposes and that he had no

knowledge of the vehicle being used for the commission of this offence.

The Appellant in his evidence has stated that he was at Horowpathana

on the 28th April and on the 29th he called his driver to ask him to bring the

lorry to Horowpathana but the driver did not answer the telephone.

Thereafter he has called his home and his wife has informed that the lorry

was seized by the police for transporting cattle. Since the offence was

committed on the 30th of April, there was no way for the Appellant to come

3

to know about a seizer of the vehicle on the 29th because there was no seizer

on 29

th This confusion was not cleared in the re examination. Therefore the

learned Magistrate disbelieved the Appellant.

The Appellant has further stated in his evidence that the driver had

come to his house by a motor bicycle but as it had a tire puncture, he has

kept the bicycle at the Appellant's house and asked his wife for the lorry

and took it away and committed this offence. The learned Magistrate

disbelieved this evidence also because the wife was not called to give

evidence and the statement made by the wife to the Appellant remains as

hearsay evidence.

The Appellant has not led any evidence to establish that he has taken

any precaution to prevent the lorry being used for illegal purposes other than

stating that the lorry is used only for his business purposes and not for hiring

purposes. The learned Magistrate has considered this aspect also in

confiscating the vehicle.

The Appellate Court should not interfere with any factual finding of

the trial judge based on evidence led before him unless it is perverse. In the

present case the trial judge's finding is supported by the evidence led before

him. Therefore there is no reason to interfere with the findings of the

learned Magistrate or the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. No Costs.
