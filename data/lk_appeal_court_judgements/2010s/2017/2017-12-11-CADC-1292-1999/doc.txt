M.M.A. GAFFOOR J

The plaintiff-respondent (hereinafter referred to as plaintiff)

filed the above action in the District Court of Galle seeking to partition the

land called "Pokunubadawaththa" Lot A depicted in Plan No.3270 of

19.09.1993 and 03.10.1993. The said land is described as Al to A3 by

Licensed Surveyor, Ananda Wijesekera. The said Preliminary Plan is

marked X and report marked Xl.

At the inception of the trial both parties admitted that

the land depicted in Plan marked 'X' is the corpus to be partitioned in the

said case. Further, both parties have admitted that the original owner was

one Appusingho Warusawithana. Therefore, there seems to be no contest

as regards to the corpus nor the pedigree.

Case proceeded with 10 issues. 8 issues by the plaintiff and

issue No.9 to 10 by the defendant. The plaintiff has submitted documents

PI to P30 and the defendant, vI to V4. It is to be observed that the

defendant in her evidence, or tendered documents to show that she had

been residing in the land to be partitioned or that she was ever been in

occupation of the said land.

The defendant's position was that the original owner Appu

Singho derived title by Deed of Gift executed in 15.03.1906. The

3

defendant's Deed marked V4 executed in 15.03.1906 pertains to a

mortgage pertaining to 32 coconut trees but it does not depict which part

of the land the mortgage is referred to. The plaintiff had suggested that

V2 and V3 are two Deeds that were not in operation. The defendants

had not at any stage proved that the land depicted in V 1 was occupied by

them. Furthermore, no evidence had been led in respect of V2 and V3 to

show that they were in occupation of the land depicted in those two

deeds. By tendering P12 the defendant had admitted the pedigree

tendered by the plaintiff. Accordingly she is estopped from contesting

(P12) the pedigree.

The learned District Judge had observed that when the

surveyor visited the land on commission, both plaintiff and the defendant

had been present and the buildings marked No.1 and No. 2 have been

claimed by the defendant and the plaintiff. According to their claims the

defendant had claimed 9/10 and the defendant 1/10 of the said

buildings. There had been no dispute as regard the plantations in the

corpus. No issues have been raised in this regard too. Therefore, the

learned District Judge had come to the conclusion that all parties have

agreed on the pedigree tendered in the partition action (vide page 146

and 147 of the appeal brief).

It is to be noted that when the surveyor surveyed the land as

both parties were present they cannot subsequently take any objections

which had not been taken at the initial stage. In the case of

4

Ir Ift!!II

Maddumaralalage Susil and another vs. Maddumaralalage Dona

Mary Nona and other SC 174/2010 SCM of 08.06.2016 H/L Eva

Wanasundera J had observed thus;

"According to the Partition Law, a commission to survey the land is

taken out at the initial stages and at that stage, the parties to the

action resolve the matter about the identification of the land.

Thereafter it should be taken as an admitted fact. "

In the light of the above decision of the Supreme Court the parties

cannot dispute the extent of the survey plan.

This Court notes that the defendant In the original Court

had abstained from answering very important questions when she had

been cross examined by the Counsel for the plaintiff. We note that on

several important matters when the question was posed to the defendant

she had kept silent and the proceedings bear testimony to what the

Court had observed as "Cd15)6~l:lil 25)1.15)".

It is to be noted that the Judge of the original Court was the

best person to have observed the demeanor of the witnesses in a trial

before them. The evasion to answer the important questions posed to

the witness infers that the witness was either evading the issues or does

not want to come out with the truth.

This Court, further observes that the learned District Judge

had very clearly analyzed the evidence led and taken into consideration

the documents marked in this case. In such circumstances, Appellate

Courts are always slow to interfere with the decisions arrived at by the

trial Judges as far as the facts of the case is concerned. This position had

been accepted and upheld by the superior Courts in many occasions. In

Alwis vs. Piyasena Fernando -1993 (1) 1SlR at page 119, HjL G.P.S. de

Silva J held thus;

"It is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial judge

who hears and sees the witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed on

appeal."

This view is supported by the undernoted decisions

De Silva and others v. Senevirathna and another - 1981 (2)

Minutes of 09.05.2013)

In the circumstances this Court IS not inclined to reverse the

judgment unless it is perverse.

Having examined the evidence pertaining to the facts of this case it

IS impossible for this Court to note that the judgment is perverse.

Accordingly, this Court does not see any error committed by the learned

trial Judge.

The appeal stand dismissed with costs Rs.I0,OOO/=.
