The Accused Appellant along with another Accused were indicted under section 296 and 300 of the Penal Code for the murder of a person named Rajapaksha Pathiranage Pedrick Singho and for attempting to commit murder of a person named Rajapaksha Pathiranage Premasiri in the High Court of Kaluthara respectively.

The Appellant was convicted and sentenced to death on the first count.

This appeal is from the said order.

The story of the prosecution is that on the day in question (31.10.1985) the deceased had come to his sister's boutique to have dinner. The Appellant who was residing about 50 yards away from the said boutique has come and attacked the deceased with a knife when he was leaving the said boutique after dinner.

Premasiri, who was closing the doors of the said boutique, having had come to the assistance of the deceased, too was attacked by the Appellant.

It appears from the evidence placed before the High Court that there had been a dispute over an undivided land where both parties had been picking coffee beans.

The Learned President's Counsel submitted that the eye-witness did not see the beginning of the incident and said that the appellant has explained the entire incident in his evidence.

He further submitted that the production which was recovered under section 27(1) of the Evidence Ordinance was not produced by the prosecution.

He argued that the Learned High Court Judge has not considered the lesser culpability on the evidence given by the defen~e~

<J.., On a perusal of Premasiri' s evidence, this court finds that he has witnessed the incident when the deceased sustained stab injuries. This incident has taken place in front of the said boutique.

The investigating officer has found blood stains on the ground in front of the said Boutique as-well. c ~ If the version of the defen~e is correct, the investigating officer would have found blood stains on ..... the road as the Appellant states that he was pursued and attacked by the deceased on the road.

The medical officer who performed the Post-Mortem states that the deceased had sustained two injuries and the injury No.1 was caused by a sharp weapon.

The Medical Officer giving evidence has stated that those injuries were not sustained on a sudden fight. This shows the murderous intention of the Appellant.

It was held in Sudu-Banda Vs. A.G 1998 3SLR 375 that "Although the gun was listed as a production but not produced, the non-production was not fatal to the Prosecution." This court holds that the legal principal discussed in the above case also applies to the case at hand.

The Learned High Court Judge has considered all these facts In analyzing the evidence placed before him.

On a perusal of the evidence, this court finds that there is absolutely no material to bring down the conviction to a lesser offense.

For the afore-said reasons, we are not inclined to interfere with a well-considered judgment.

The judgment dated 25.04.2006 is affirmed. The Appeal is dismissed.

Appeal Dismissed.
