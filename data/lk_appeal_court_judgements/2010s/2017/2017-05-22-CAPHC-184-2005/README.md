This is an appeal from the High Court ofNegombo.

The first party Petitioner Petitioner Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes called and referred to as the Respondent) instituted action in the

Primary Court of Watthala under section 66( 1 )(b) of the Primary Court

Procedure Act on a land dispute threatening breach of the peace. After

completing the pleadings, the learned Magistrate first inquired in to the

matter of the threat or the likelihood of the breach of the peace and decided

3

that there is no threat or likelihood of the breach of the peace and dismissed

the application. Being aggrieved, the Respondent filed a revision application

in the High Court of Negombo where the learned High Court Judge held

that the breach of the peace is likely and directed the learned Magistrate to

accept the application and to proceed. This appeal is there from.

A threat or the likelihood to occur a breach of the peace due to the

land dispute is a pre condition for the Primary Court to assume jurisdiction

under Part VII of the Primary Court Procedure Act. Section 66 (1) (a) of the

Act empowers a police officer to file information under the Act. In such a

situation the police officer has to decide whether the breach of the peace is

likely or threatened. Under subsection (b) of section 66( 1), a private party

can file information and it is the Court that has to decide whether the breach

of the peace is threatened or likely due to the dispute.

But, under section 66 of the Primary Courts' Procedure Act, the

formation of the opinion as to whether a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely is left to the police officer inquiring into the

dispute and he is, in such circumstances, required to file an

information regarding the dispute with the least possible delay.

Where the information is thus filed in a Primary Court, subsection (2)

of that section vests that court with jurisdiction to inquire into - and

make a determination - or order on the dispute regarding which the:

information is filed. Hence, in the instant case, when the O. 1. C.

Morawaka Police filed the information under section 66: of the said

Act, the court was thereby vested with the necessary jurisdiction. ,

Under section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, the

formation of the opinion as to whether a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely is left to the police officer inquiring into the

dispute. The police officer is empowered to file the information if

there is a dispute affecting land and a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely. The Magistrate is not put on inquiry as to

whether a breach of the peace is threatened or likely. In terms of

section 66 (2) the Court is vested with jurisdiction to inquire into and

make a determination on the dispute regarding which information is

filed either under section 66 (1)(a) or 66 (1)(b).

However when an information is filed under section 66 (1)(b) the only

material that the Magistrate would have before him is the affidavit

information of an interested person and in such a situation without

the benefit of further assistance from a police report, the Magistrate

should proceed cautiously and ascertain for himself whether there is

a dispute affecting land and whether a breach of the peace is

threatened or likely.

In the instant case, the parties have filed their respective pleadings by

way of affidavits and counter affidavits and the documents relied on are also

filed. The learned Magistrate inquired in to the matter of the threat to the

breach of the peace after the affidavits have been filed. The acceptance of

the application and ordering to issue notice does not preclude the learned

Magistrate from inquiring in to the matter of the threat to the breach of the

peace. The learned Magistrate can consider all the relevant material before

coming in to the conclusion on the issue.

Every land dispute is not a threat to the peace. If there is a land

dispute, the remedy is to litigate in the proper forum to vindicate the rights.

The Primary Court Procedure Act provides only a temporary remedy to

prevent the breach of the peace until such time that a competent Court

decides on rights of the parties. In the present case also no doubt that there

is a land dispute. But the two complaints made by the Respondent to the

police with regard to the said dispute, which are marked as Pe 7 and Pe 8,

does not show that there is any threat to the peace due to the land dispute. Pe

7 says that certain activity has taken place in the land in his absence and Pe

8 says that on his request the wrong doers have left the land. There is a land

dispute between the parties but there is no threat or likelihood of a breach of

the peace. Since there is no threat to the peace, the Magistrate Court do not

assume jurisdiction under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

The learned Magistrate has correctly identified that there is no threat

to the peace due to the land dispute in question. The learned High Court

Judge misdirected himself and has come to the conclusion that there is a

threat or likelihood of the breach of the peace without any evidence.

I set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge and affirm the

order of the learned Magistrate.

Appeal allowed with costs fixed at Rs. 10,000.00
