The Accused-Petitioner Kosgama Liyanage Lasantha Udaya Kumara filed

this Revision Application to set aside the Learned Magistrate's Order dated 22

/09/2015 and to Revise the order dated 17/12/2013 and impose a reasonable

sentence accordance with the law, and for further relief as prayed for in the

prayer of the petition.

On 31/05/2016 this matter was supported by the Counsel for the

Petitioner and accordingly, notice was issued on the Respondent returnable

for 29/06/2016. On 29/09/2016 statement of objections were filed of record

by the Respondent and the case was fixed for inquiry. On 24/01/2014 parties

tendered their written submissions as there was no settlement.

Thereafter the case was fixed for order on the 24/01/2014. In the morning

when this court called the case the Petitioner and his counsel was not present

in court therefore this court dismissed the said application for want of

appearance. Thereafter the counsel for the Petitioner appeared in court and

moved that court be pleased to accept his written submissions.

This court there after having regard to the application set aside the order

and permitted the application of the Petitioner which has in advertently not

been recorded.

On a perusal of the record we find that the Petitioner was charged under

section 440, 369 and 395 of the Penal Code in the Magistrate Court of Chilaw.

The Petitioner in the first instance on 05/07/2011 pleaded not guilty. The

Petitioner later on 14/05/2013 has pleaded guilty. The Petitioner was to pay

Rs.90,000/- to the aggrieved party in installments of Rs.10,000/-each the

Petitioner had ten previous convictions. The Petitioner did not pay the amount

aforesaid as agreed. The sentencing took place on 17/12/2013 it was as

follows,

(i) 1st_3 rd counts 2 years rigorous imprisonment

(ii) 1st _3 rd counts fine of Rs.1500 for each count in default of

3 months imprisonment for each counts.

(iii) According to section 17(7) of the Criminal Procedure

Act, a compensation of Rs.89,000/- shall be paid to the

virtual complainant in default 6 months imprisonment.

(iv) If compensation is paid, all sentences shall be suspended

for 10 years.

(v) If compensation is not paid, the suspended terms given

in Magistrate Court Marawila cases No. bearing 12250,

12449,12454,13708,12450,12454 shall be started to

operate.

Accordingly, it was contended by the Accused-Petitioner that the gold

goods which was the subject matter of this case was found to be not, so when

it was tested and examined by the bank. However proof of same has not been

produced to this court. However parties has come to a settlement that the

compensation to be Rs. 80,000/-. Accordingly, we revise and vary the Learned

High Court judge's order the compensation to read as Rs.80,000/- instead of

Rs.89,000/- and in default 4 years rigorous imprisonment further we direct the

and order of the Magistrate's Court dated 17/12/2013 subject to the aforesaid

variation. We disallow the application of the Petitioner with costs of Rs.

10,000/-.
