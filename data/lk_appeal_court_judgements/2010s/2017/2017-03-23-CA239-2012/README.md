Respondents

The petitioner invoked the Writ jurisdiction of this court to quash the decisions marked and produced X4

and XS.

The Petitioner is engaged in the importing of Motor Vehicles. He states that he sold vehicles which had

been imported under a valid permit duly issued by the controller of imports to various temples"

Viharasthana karya Sadhaka Samithiya" (herein after VKSS) which societies had been duly registered

under the Societies Ordinance.

"

He admits in Para 3 of his Petition that, at the time of the issuance of the said license, the controller of

Imports and Exports had laid down, inter alia, the following conditions.

(i) The vehicle should be registered under the nameof the licensee

(ii) The vehicle should not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed for (05) years from

the date of registration in Sri Lanka.

The Petitioner has admitted at the inquiry held by the 4th Respondent that he sold 42 vehicles imported

under the permits issued to the VKSS.

The above mentioned admission made by the Petitioner is a clear violation of the conditions stipulated

by the Controller of Imports and Exports.

S.sO A(l)(b) of the Customs Ordinance provides that where any goods imported into Sri Lanka have been

allowed into Sri Lanka under any other law subject to any condition to be fulfilled after their

importation and where such conditions are not complied with then such goods shall be forfeited.

Therefore in the teeth of the above provision, the Customs have the jurisdiction to hold the above

mentioned inquiry and the steps taken by the Customs Department to impose a fine on the Petitioner, is

nor illegal. Further, the forfeiture of 42 vehicles too is within the powers vested under the provisions of

the Customs Ordinance.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the decisions under attack are not amenable to Writ Jurisdiction of

this Court and proceed to dismiss the Application with costs fixed at Rs. 50,000/-

Application Dismissed.
