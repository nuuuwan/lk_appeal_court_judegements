Before the sentence was passed the learned High Court Judge gave the

option of making submissions with regard to the sentence. After considering

the submissions, the learned High Court Judge, impose a term of 15 years

Rigorous Imprisonment with a fine of Rs 10,0001- and a default term of one

year. Further the accused-appellant was ordered to pay a sum of Rs.

100,0001- as compensation to the victim with a default terms of one year

Rigorous Imprisonment.

According to the evidence led at the trial, mother of the victim had left

the house and father being the sole breadwinner was out of the house owing

to this work. Victim with her siblings used to sleep in the house alone.

Accused was a frequent visitor to the house of the victim. One night

accused had come to victim's house when her father was not at home.

Accused had taken the victim out of the house and stripped her and forcibly

committed rape on her. After the 1 st incident Accused had repeated the same

offence several times. Victim although had told her grandmother,

grandmother had not taken any step. The incident had come to light only

when the Divisional Secretary got to know the incident and reported the

matter to the police in the area. After receiving information police had

5

commenced their investigation. Victim had been produced before the JMO

who had examined her. JMO says inter labial penetration cannot be

excluded.

The defence version is that since accused and his brother (Victim's

father) are angry with each other, that this is a false complaint.

When this matter came up for argument the counsel for the accused-

appellant took up the position that, the charge framed in the indictment is

contrary to Section 165 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

When this Court perused the indictment the number of dates

mentioned in the indictment exceeded one year.

The indictment in this case doesn't comply, with Section 165 (2) of

the Criminal Procedure Code. The Criminal Procedure Code has

specifically stated under Section 165 (2) "provided that the time included

between the first and the last of such dates shall not exceeded one year". In

this case the indictment should have been amended at the outset or before

the judgment was passed. Neither has happened. Therefore, we hold that

the indictment is bad in law.

But when we peruse the evidence led at the trial we are of the view

that victim should not suffer for the mistake of someone else.

In view of the legal objection taken by the counsel for the accused-

appellant that the indictment is bad in law, this Court uphold the said legal

objection of the learned Counsel for the defence.

Hence we order that the judgment of the learned High Court Judge of

Rathnapura dated 14.05.2010 be set aside, and a fresh trial de novo be held

by the learned High Court Judge.

We further direct the learned high Court Judge of Rathnapura to give

priority and hear this case day to day and expeditiously dispose of the same.

The Registrar is directed to issue a copy of this order to the Learned

High Court Judge ofRathnapura.
