Deepali Wijesundera,J.

Accused-Appellant in this case was charged under Section

298 and 329 of the Penal Code. After trial he was sentenced to

two years imprisonment with a fine of Rs.10,000/- with a default

term of 08 months imprisonment for the 18t charge and 10

months imprisonment for the 2nd charge.

Counsel for the Accused-Appellant informed Court that he

is not contesting the conviction but only the sentence.

Senior State Counsel, Anoopa de Silva informed Court that

she has no objections for the sentence to be varied.

Considering the evidence of this case, we decide to vary the

sentence and the jail term ordered for the 1st charge which is

suspended for 5 years. The fine will remains as it is.

The sentence for the 2nd charge is suspended for 5 years.

Subject to the above variation the judgment of the High

Court is affirmed.

Appeal is dismissed.
