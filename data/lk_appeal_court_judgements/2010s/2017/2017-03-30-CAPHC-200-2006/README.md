This is an appeal from the High Court ofBalapitiya.

The dispute in this appeal is with regard to a right of way. The 2nd

Party Respondent Petitioner Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and

referred to as the Respondent) made a complaint to the Elpitiya police

stating that the 1 st Party Respondent Respondent Appellant's (hereinafter

sometimes called and referred to as the Appellant) started taking heavy

vehicles through his land without any right. The police, after

investigations, filed information before the Magistrate Court of Elpitiya,

under part vii of the Primary Court Procedure Act. The learned Magistrate

after completing the pleadings and the written submissions, made the

determination that the Respondent is entitled for a right of way of 5 feet to

be used only as a foot path and did not permit to take motor vehicles.

Being aggrieved, the Respondent moved in revision in the High Court of

Balapitiya where the learned High Court Judge acted in revision and

removed the prohibition imposed on motor vehicles and allowed the

Respondent to take three wheelers through the 5 feet roadway. Being

aggrieved by the order of the learned High Court Judge, the Appellant

presented this appealed to this Court seeking to set aside the order of the

learned High Court Judge.

The Learned Magistrate has duly considered the affidavits and the

relevant documents filed by the parties and has come to the conclusion that

there were no evidence to establish the usage of a motorway through the

land of the Appellant but only a foot path has been established.

Accordingly the learned Magistrate correctly allowed the foot path.

Though the Appellant challenge the order of the learned Magistrate in

these proceedings, he has not challenged it at the proper forum, no revision

application filed by the Appellant against the order of the learned

Magistrate and there is no prayer in the petition of appeal to set aside the

order of the learned Magistrate. Therefore he cannot challenge the order of

the learned Magistrate at the argument stage.

In the revision application to the High Court, the Counsel for the

Respondent (the petitioner in the revision application) suggested that a

motorway for the use of heavy vehicles is no longer necessary, now the

necessity is only to take a three wheeler to his house and it can be done

without expanding the width of the roadway. Considering these

submissions the learned High Court Judge has come to the conclusion that

a three wheeler can be taken in a 5 foot wide road and it will not prejudice

the other party. on this footing the learned High Court Judge acted in

revision and removed the prohibition of using the path as a motorway and

allowed to take a three wheeler.

The extraordinary power of revision is vested in appellate courts for

the due administration of justice. But it has its own limits. A Court cannot

make orders in the guise of reviving an order of a lower Court without

considering the legal provisions governing the situation. Under section

69( 1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act the learned Magistrate has to

determine whether the party has established his entitlement to the right.

Unless the entitlement is established, the Court cannot make order under

section 69(2). The section reads thus;

69.

(1) Where the dispute relates to any right to any land or any part of

a land, other than the right to possession of such land or part

thereof, the Judge of the Primary Court shall determine as to who is

entitled to the right which is the subject of the dispute and make an

order under subsection (2).

(2) An order under this subsection may declare that any person

specified therein shall be entitled to any such right in or respecting

the land or in any part of the land as may be specified in the order

until such person is deprived of such right by virtue of an order or

decree of a competent court, and prohibit all disturbance or

interference with the exercise of such right by such party other than

under the authority of an order or decree as aforesaid.

In the present case the learned Magistrate has come to the

conclusion that a right to use a motorway was not established by the

I ~ I i !

\

evidence. The learned High Court Judge, without considering any of the

evidence presented by the parties, only on the premise that taking a three

wheeler will not prejudice the land owner; has allowed the three wheeler to

be taken through the land.

The right of a foot path and a right to use a motorway are two

different rights. Just because that there was a 5 feet foot path, he does not

become entitle to use the path to take vehicles less than 5 feet wide unless

he proves that he is entitle to use the road as a motorway. In this case the

Respondent has failed to establish the use of a motorway.

De Kretser J. held in the case of Jayasekera Hamine vs. Agida

Hamine 46 NLR 38 that the servitude of footway (iter) includes the right to

use a bicycle or wheelbarrow. But a three wheeler is a motorized vehicle

which moves faster making a noise not like a bicycle or a wheelbarrow.

Therefore I believe that a three wheeler cannot be put in to the category of

a "bicycle or a wheelbarrow". It is a vehicle of its own.

My view is that the learned High Court Judge has misdirected

himself in allowing three wheelers to be taken through the foot path.

Accordingly I set aside the order of the learned High Court Judge and

affirm the order of the learned Magistrate.

Appeal allowed.
