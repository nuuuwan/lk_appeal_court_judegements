CASE NO- CA /1311/98 (F)- 27.01.2017- ORDER

P.R. Walgama, J

The matter to be resolved before this court IS the

preliminary objection raised by the Defendant

Respondent, as to the maintainability of the instant

appeal of the Plaintiff- Appellant on the basis that the

2

Notice of Appeal and the Petition of Appeal has not

been filed by the Attorney -at-law on the record of

the Plaintiff-Respondent.

It IS contended by the counsel for the Defendant-

Respondent that the notice of appeal has been signed

by S.P.K. Gunaratne Attorney -at- law, and the Petition

of Appeal has been signed by Mr. Sajeewa Gun aratn e

Attorney- at -law, do not bear the signature on record.

The journal entry dated 04.06.1992 bears testimony

that the plaintiff has given the proxy to Mr. Bernard

De Zoysa Attorney -at-law, which was never revoked.

It IS submitted by the counsel for the Respondent

that as Mr. Bernard de Zoysa informed court that he

intends to revoke the proxy and the court has

granted a further date for the Plaintiff to file a

fresh proxy. Eventually a fresh proxy has been filed

by Mr. Sanjeewa Gunaratne. Further it is to be noted

that there had not been a revocation of the earlier

proxy filed by Mr Bernard De Zoysa Attorney- At- law.

In addition it IS noted that there IS no proof that

Sajeewa Gunaratne and S.P.K. Gunaratne IS one and

the same person.

For brevity and convenience sake the relevant section

of the Civil Procedure Code IS reproduced herein

below;

3

Ii,

Section 27 (2)

"when so filed, it shall be 1n force until revoked

with the leave of the court and after notice to the

Registered Attorney by a writing signed by the client

and filed 1n court, or until the client dies or until

the registered attorney dies, 1S removed or suspended,

or otherwise becomes incapable to act, or until all

proceedings 1n the action are ended and judgment 1S

satisfied so far as regards the client"

The counsel for the Defendant- Respondent has

adverted court to Section 91 of the Civil Procedure

Code which deals with the revocation of the proxy.

Section- 91

"every application made to court in the course of an

action, incidental thereto, and not a step 1n the

regular procedure shall be made by motion by the

applicant 1n person or his counselor registered

attorney, and a memorandum 1n writing of such

motion shall be at the same time delivered to the

court."

Therefore it 1S contended by the counsel for the

Respondent that a mere oral application 1S not

sufficient to have a proxy revoked.

In addition to the afore said the counsel for the

Defendant- Respondent had drawn the attention of

court to section 755(1) and section 755(3) of the

4

Civil Procedure Code which has explicitly stated

mandatory requirement that the notice of appeal

the petition of appeal shall be signed by

appellant or his registered attorney. Therefore

seen from the case record that the original

as a

and

the

it IS

proxy

holder Mr. Bernard de Zoysa's proxy has not been

formally revoked, and as such the notice of appeal

and the petition I)f appeal filed by Mr. S.P.K.

Gunaratne and Mr. Sanjeewa Gunaratne will have no

force in law.

The said Issue has drawn the attention of our

supenor courts and In those cases there Lordships

had observed thus;

" MANAMPERI SOMAWATHIE .VS. BUWANESHWARI-1990

(1) SLR-223

"when a party gIves a proxy to an attorney- at -law it

remains In force until revoked with leave of court

after written notice to such registered attorney. The

proxy so filed is binding on the party dies or until

all the proceedings In the action are ended judgment

satisfied so far as regards the party. Once a

registered attorney IS on record the party could

necessarily act only through the registered attorney."

There are

had taken

law.

plethora of judicial pronouncements which

cognIsance of the well settle above stated

5

The counsel for the Plaintiff- Appellant submits to

court as per journal entry dated 27.10.1994, that the

court had granted the application for Mr. Bernard de

Zoysa to revoke the proxy and had discharged him

from his duties as the registered attorney of the

Plaintiff. But it IS clearly seen what has been

recorded on 27.10.1994 IS not what the counsel for

the Plaintiff - Appellant stated. It IS apparent that the

Learned District Judge has not made any order as

to the revocation of the said proxy and no order

has been made as to the acceptance of a new

proxy by another attorney-at-law. But it is seen from

the proceedings that there IS no formal revocation or

of an acceptance of a fresh proxy by court.

The counsel for the Plaintiff - Appellant thrust on

mainly dealt many judicial pronouncements which

with the technicalities and the effect

has

thereto.

When considering the legal matrix in relation to the

core issue to be resolved as a preliminary issue this

court IS of the VIew that the said objection should

be upheld and appeal should be dismissed In limine.

Accordingly objection IS upheld, and appeal IS

dismissed without costs.
