The Plaintiff - Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted

action in the District Court of Negombo by plaint dated 22.02.1990 to partition

the land described in the schedule to the Plaint depicted in Plan No. 849 dated

1992.02.27 prepared by K.O. Fernando Licensed Surveyor.

According to the Plaint the 15t Defendant - Appellant (hereinafter referred to as

the 15t Defendant) was entitled to an undivided share of the corpus by Deed No.

5146 dated 16.06.1998. The Identity of the corpus is not in dispute between the

parties.

The 15t Defendant by his 15t statement of objections dated 27.l1.1992 admitted

to the title claimed by the Plaintiff and acknowledged that the 15t Defendant was

entitled to an undivided Yz share of the corpus. However, by his amended

statement of claim dated 29.07.1993 the 15t Defendant reverses his position and

denies the title of the Plaintiff and prays for a dismissal of the action whilst

claiming title to the entire land.

Trial commenced on 18.09.1995 with 3 issues been raised for the Plaintiff and 2

issues been raised for the 15t Defendant. Documents marked P 1 - P5 were

marked on behalf of the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff, one Ananda J ayasinghe and

one Thiyunugalpedige Sutin gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff. The 15t

Defendant, one Sinhalapedige Simon and one Sinhalapedige Siyadoris gave

evidence on behalf of the 15t Defendant and marked document 1 VI and closed

the case for the 15t Defendant. The 2nd -5th Defendant -Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the 2nd - 5th Defendants) are the lawful issues of the

Plaintiff.

The point of contention between the parties concerns the flow of title from one

Leelawathie i.e. whether title devolves on Leelawathie's only son (Plaintiff's

husband) as contended by the Plaintiff or whether Leelawathie died unmarried

and issueless in which event her entitlement devolves on her brother Sediris

through whom the 15t Defendant claims title.

I!II!II!IIf

The pt Defendant contends that the Plaintiffs husband, one Premasinghe, is not

the son of Leelawathie aforementioned and as such when Leelawathie died

issueless, her entitlement i.e. undivided Yz share devolved on her brother Sediris,

who thereby became entitled to the whole corpus as the ownership of the other

undivided Yz share was with him. The contention is that the said Sediris

transferred the entirety of the corpus to the 1 st Defendant via deed marked as

IVI dated 16.06.1988 bearing No. 5146.

Although the best evidence in support of the Plaintiff s position that the

Plaintiff s husband was the only son of the said Leelawathie, would be to

produce a birth certificate to that effect, the Plaintiff produced document

marked P4, a result of search of registers of Births, stating that the relevant

information was not available since the relevant documentation has eroded. The

Plaintiff led the evidence of one Ananda Jayasinghe a retired Grama Sevaka of

that area, in in this regard, and in his evidence-in-chief the said witness

confirms the fact that Leelawathi' s only son was the Plaintiff s husband, the

said Premasinghe. The evidence of the said Ananda Jayasinghe has not been

vitiated by the 1 st Defendant at cross-examination and it seems that both

Sinhalapedige Simon and Sinhalapedige Siyadoris who gave evidence on behalf

of the 1 st Defendant who were from the same village did not state that the said

Premasinghe was not a son of Leelawathie.

In circumstances where the maternity IS III question, III the absence of

documentary evidence to establish such maternity it is the testimony of

witnesses that Court must rely on. The learned District Court Judge by

impugned judgment dated 23.10.1997 has carefully evaluated the evidence

placed before Court at trial and has correctly held that the Plaintiff s contention

that, the said Premasighe was the only son of Leelawathie has been proved and

5

the 15t Defendant has failed to adduce sufficient evidence to refute this

contention.

The question of whether the 15t Defendant is entitled to the corpus by way of

prescription does not arise since the 15t Defendant has failed to prove that he

was in continued, undisturbed adverse possession of the corpus.

In these circumstances, this Court sees no basis on which to set aside I alter the

findings of the leaned District Court Judge dated 23.10. 1997 and as such the

instant appeal is dismissed without costs.

Appeal dismissed.
