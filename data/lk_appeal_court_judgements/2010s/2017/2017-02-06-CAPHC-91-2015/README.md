The Applicants Respondents Respondents (the Respondents) were

workers in the Duro Pipe (Private) Ltd. they have filed several

applications in the Gampaha Labour Tribunal against the Employer

seeking redress for terminating their services. The Employer Respondent,

Petitioner Appellant (the Employer) raised a preliminary objection on the

maintainability of the application in the LT. the learned President of the

L T has rejected the said preliminary objection. Being aggrieved by the

said order the Employer moved in revision in the High Court of

Gampaha. Later the case has been transferred to the High Court of

Negombo on an administrative reason and the learned High Court Judge

of Negombo dismissed the revision application. The employer being

dissatisfied with the order of the Provincial High Court of Negombo

presented this appeal to this Court.

The learned Counsel for the Respondents raised a preliminary

objection that this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain an appeal

from an order of a Provincial High Court made on exercising appellate

jurisdiction on orders of LT.

The Provincial High Courts were established under the Article

155P of the Constitution. The appellate jurisdiction was vested in

Provincial High Court by paragraph 3 (b) of the said Article. High Court

of Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 governs the

procedure to be followed in, and the right to appeal to, and from, the High

Court established under article 154P of the Constitution.

The paragraph 3(b) of the Article 154 P reads;

(3) Every such High Court shall

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to

any law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or

imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within

the Province;

(c) ...... .

The appellate and revisionary jurisdiction on orders of the LT was

vested with the Provincial High Court by section 3 of the Act No. 19 of

1990 which reads;

3. A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitutionfor

a Province shall, subject to any law, exercise appellate and

revisionary jurisdiction in respect of orders made by Labour

Tribunals within that Province and orders made under section 5 or

section 9 of the Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979, in respect of

any land situated within that Province.

Section 31 D of the Industrial Dispute Act as amended by the Act

No. 32 of 1990 provides that the any person aggrieved by an order of a

L T can appeal to a High Court established under Article 154P of the

Constitution. The section reads;

3ID.

(1) Every order made by a labour tribunal at the conclusion of

proceedings on an application made under section 31 B, shall be

Pronounced forthwith or within a reasonable time at a sitting of

(3) Where the workman who, or the trade union which, makes an

application to a labour tribunal, or the employer to whom that

application relates is dissatisfied with the order of the tribunal on

that application, such work man, trade union or employer may, by

written petition -in which the other party is mentioned as the

respondent, appeal from that order on a question of law, to the

High Court established under Article 154p of the Constitution, for

the Province within which such labour tribunal is situated.

Section 9 of the High Court for Provinces Act No 19 of 1990

provides that an appeal from an order made in exercising appellate

jurisdiction by the Provincial High Court lies in the Supreme Court. The

section reads;

9. Subject to the provisions of this Act or any other law, any person

aggrieved by

(a) a final order, judgment, decree or sentence of a High

Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution in

the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested in it by

paragraph (3) (b) of Article 154P of the Constitution or

section 3 of this Act or any other law, in any matter or

proceeding whether civil or criminal which involves a

substantial question of law, may appeal therefrom to the

Supreme Court if the High Court grants leave to appeal to

the Supreme Court ex mero moue or at the instance of any

aggrieved party to such matter or proceedings:

Provided that the Supreme Court may, in its discretion,

grant special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court from

any final or interlocutory order, judgment, decree or

sentence made by such High Court, in the exercise of the

5

appellate jurisdiction vested in it by paragraph (3) (b) of

Article 154 P of the Constitution or section 3 of this Act, or

any other law where such High Court has refused to grant

leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, or where in the

opinion of the Supreme Court, the ease or matter is fit for

review by the Supreme Court:

Provided further that the Supreme Court shall grant leave

to appeal in every matter or proceeding in which it is

satisfied that the question to be decided is of public or

general importance ; and

(b) a final order, judgment or sentence of a High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution in the

exercise of its jurisdiction conferred on it by paragraph

(3) (a), or (4) of Article 154P of the Constitution may

appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal.

The section 31 DD of the industrial Dispute Act as amended by Act

No. 32 of 1990 the appellate jurisdiction against orders of the Provincial

High Courts was vested with the Supreme Court. The section reads;

31DD.

(1) Any workman, trade union or employer who is aggrieved by

any final order of a High Court established under Article 154P OF

the Constitution, in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction vested

in it by law or in the exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction vested

in it by law, in relation to an order of a labour tribunal, may

appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court with the leave of the High

Court or the Supreme Court first had an obtained.

(2) The Supreme Court shall, have sole and exclusive cognizance

by way of appeal from any order made by such High Court, in the

exercise of the jurisdiction vested in such High Court by subsection

(3) of section 31 D, and it may affirm, reverse or vary any such

order of such High Court and may issue such directions to any

labour tribunal or order a new trial or further hearing in any

proceedings as the justice of the ease may require and may also

call for and admit fresh or additional evidence if the interests of

justice so demands and may in such event, direct that such

evidence be recorded by such High Court or any labour tribunal.

(3) The Supreme Court shall hear and finally dispose of an appeal

preferred to it under subsection (1), within one year of the date on

which such appeal is filed in the Supreme Court.

The law is very clear that the appeal against an order of the

Provincial High Court does not lie in the Court of Appeal. It lies on the

Supreme Court on leave being obtained from the High Court or the

Supreme Court.

It has been held by Andrew Somawansa J. (PICA) in the case of

Sunil Jayawardana vs. Puttalam Cement Company Limited CA (PHC)

APN 265/2004 CA Minutes dated 05.08.2005 held that;

"1 am not at all in agreement with the aforesaid submissions for

the simple reason that the 13th amendment to the Constitution

which grants appellate powers against an order made in a High

Court in an industrial dispute make no provisions for granting

appellate jurisdiction either by way of appeal or revision to this

Court. (Court of Appeal). 1 would say the preliminary objection

raised by the respondent applicant respondent is sustainable and

far reaching one cannot come to this Court for redress when the

7

relief lies elsewhere and this Court cannot by implication surmise

or by conjecture assert itself with jurisdiction that has not been

granted in law. "

Under these circumstances, I uphold the preliminary objection

raised by the Respondent.

The appeal is dismissed subject to costs fixed at Rs. 10,000.00
