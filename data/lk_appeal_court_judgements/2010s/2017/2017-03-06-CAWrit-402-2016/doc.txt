(d) Make Order forthwith calling for and examining the file pertaining to tender

marked 'X8' and the entire documentary process including the approval of the short

listing and the Technical Evaluation Committee documents and recommendations,

(e) Issue a Writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the purported decision of the 1st and/or 2nd and/or 4th Respondents as more fully set out in the letters dated

25.10.2016 marked 'XI0',

(f) Grant and Issue a writ of mandamus directing the Respondents to grant and issue

and/or continue the process recommendation of the Technical Evaluation

the operation of the travel service counters at the Arrival Public Concourse at the

Bandaranaike International Airport.

(g) For costs.

(h) For such other and further relief as to this Court deem meet.

The Petitioner claims that he has been operating a travel and tourism services at the Arrival

Public Concourse at the Bandaranaike International Airport for more than 14 years. (In the

same location)

The Petitioner states that there was an advertisement in the newspaper calling for tenders

for operation of travel service counters at the Arrival Public Concourse at the Bandaranaike

International Airport. The Petitioner and several other forwarded their bids for the said

tenders.

It was pleaded, that the Petitioner and several others were notified by the Technical

Evaluation Committee (TEe) that they were selected, on or about 30/03/2016. Petitioner

also pleads that the Ministerial Committee had changed the TEC recommendation and had

included 6 parties as successful bidders, which includes two parties who were rejected

originally for lack of financial pre-qualifications. Rejection was communicated by the 1st

respondent via X6.

The Petitioner submits that they made several protests including communication with

relevant authorities including H.E the President; due to the impasse the secretary to the

Ministry by letter dated 14/07/2016 took a decision to cancel the tender awards (X9).

Subsequently the Petitioner was suddenly informed by (XI0) letter dated 25/10/2016 that the cancellation is cancelled and the original tender selection will stand as it is.

Petitioner claims that the said revocation is untenable in law, violation of the original

bidding documents and tender process and the secretary has no authority to cancel or to

make any other arrangements.

1st to 5th respondents submit that the second affidavit dated 17th January 2017 submitted on

the same date be rejected due to the following reasons.

I. The Managing Director of the Petitioner's Company had filed an affidavit without prior permission of the court which is in violation of Rules of the Court of Appeal.

II. The Petitioner had deposed matters which are not in his personal knowledge, which

is contrary to basic requirements of an affidavit. .

6th to 10th respondents submit that the Petitioner had suppressed material facts to the

court.

There were three writ applications before this court namely 255/2016, 256/2016 and

257/2016 the Petitioner filed papers to intervene which were not successful and in the

present application the Petitioner states that it verily believes that three parties filed

applications and those are pending.

Further 6th to 10th respondents submits that the application is misconceived and it cannot

be granted.

Respondents also submit that necessary, parties are not before the court namely the

Members of Ministerial Procurement Committee (MPC) and Members of Technical

Evaluation Committee. (TEC)

All respondents submits that the Petitioner had misrepresented the fact that it was

operating for last 14 years in the same location, where the company itself was incorporated

8 years ago, (Le. in 2008).

Before I consider the substantive issues, wish to consider the preliminary objections and

issues.

The Petitioner had filed on the 1 i h January 2017 an affidavit together with documents

marked B1 to B6. I do not find that any permission was granted to do so. When the matter

came before me on the 15th December 2016 Mr. Sanjeewa Jayawardane PC, who appeared

in connected matters appeared and informed the court that the Petitioners had not

included the relevant parties as respondents. The counsel for the Petitioner under took to

add relevant parties and serve notice on them. Journal Entries reveal that the amended

caption was filed on the 26th December 2016 and served on the respondents including the

6th to 10th respondents.

1ih January 2017 journal Entry reveals that the Petitioner had filed an affidavit together

with B1 to B6. I do not find any permission sought to file these additional papers nor

permission been granted.

The Managing Director of the Petitioner had sworn an affidavit above mentioned which

deposed as follows:

Para 3 I depose to the matter herein contained from my own personal knowledge and from the information, documents and records in the Petitioner Company which I have perused

Para 4 I state that I received a letter by registered post from the Airport and AViation ~~rvlces (Sri Lanka) Lta on ~1/10/201' whiCh contained therein the financial statements of Airport Tourist Drivers Association.

I tender herewith a copy of the said financial statement marked 'A' together with the registered postal envelops marked 'Al'.

I presume the date stated above 31/10/2016 may be a typographical error. Anyhow the said 'Al' is not submitted to the court, at least not in the main court record.

In paragraph 5 of the affidavit he states as follows:

Para 5 I state that I received a letter together with several annexure by registered

post on 28/12/2016 from a group that call themselves CSde:leD @O>@@O)@ <X~

CS)z:8.>@ @o~) 8)~e005 e:larnBk .. , ~B> (snQe:l

Q)!lrlo:))oemG)~ O)O>2:3eDO>o CSde:leD @O>@@O)@ ~Q6)G)~

The Petitioner had submitted the said document marked Bl which letter does not have a

date, address or signature. It is an anonymous letter, I cannot believe the Petitioner had

submitted a document of which no one takes ownership and wants the court to act upon.

Adding insult to the injury the Petitioner also claims that he has personal knowledge on

documents which he submitted to court. This is not a healthier practice.

Considering the core issues of the transaction, there are 6 travel desks provided by the 2nd

respondent which were given to the person who pays the highest amount. Accordingly

there were 6 companies selected for 6 counters. Perusing the details submitted by the

respondents' details are as follows:

Counter Company Lease rental Lease rental Lease rental Total for all Number Recommended by per month per month per month three years the MPC offered in offered in offered in the 1st Year . the 2nd Year the 3rd Year

The following chart shows the offer made by the Petitioners and the award amount offered

by the successful bidder.

Counter Bid of the Petitioner for the Bid of the company awarded the contract for Number 1st Year- per month the 1st Year monthly

1 750,000 1,900,500 - Airport Tourist Drivers Association 2 600,000 1,500,000 - Abans Tours (Pvt) Ltd 3 580,000 1,279,000 - Ayubowan Tours and Travels Limited

4 560,000 1,050,900 - Lanka Travels Agent Association

5 550,000 900,000 - Casons Travels (Pvt) Ltd

6 550,000 1,078,691 - JNW Lanka Tours

The Petitioner complains that the bidding document was altered to favour the successful

bidders. Perusing the instructions to bidders (submitted by the Petitioner marked 'X4')

considering clause 13.5 and 13.6 the 2nd respondent has the right to act in the best interest of the company. The selection shows that the company is benefitting at the end of the

transaction.

Even though the 2nd respondent is a company fully owned by the government they too

should venture into profit making whenever possible, if not, it will be a burden to the tax

payers.

Considering all circumstances, especially the conduct of the Petitioners making an offer

contrary to the bidding guide lines, I find that the decision of the 1st respondent and 2nd

respondent is acceptable by this court.

Considering the preliminary objection against the Petitioner and all other matters, I find that

there is no prima facie case established by the Petitioner to issue notice hence issuance of

notice and interim orders are refused.

Application dismissed without cost.
