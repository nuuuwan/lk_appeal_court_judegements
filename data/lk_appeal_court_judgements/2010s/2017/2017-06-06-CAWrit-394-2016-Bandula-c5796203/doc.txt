VIJITH K. MALALGODA PC J (PICA)

Heard Counsel for the petitioner in support of this

application and the learned State Counsel representing the respondents.

The petitioner to the present application one Bandula Sujith Senarathna

has come before this Court seeking a Writ of Certiorari to quash the quit

notice served on him by the Divisional Secretary, Meerigama on

06.10.2016. The petitioner has taken up the position before this Court

that he is a bona fide purchaser of the land in question which is to the

extent of over 21 acres of land adjoining Kandy Road in Meerigama. The

petitioner has produced before this Court several title deeds in support of

his position and as observed by us the predecessor-in-title to the

petitioner Rainco (Private) Limited has sold this land to the petitioner

finally on 13.09.2016 for a consideration of 2.5 million. However, when

1

,

going through the documents filed by the petitioner we observed that a

quit notice is also issued on the predecessor-in-title that is Rainco

(Private) Limited on 15.09.2016 two days after the said transfer. As

submitted by the petitioner produced marked P26 on 28th September the

said Rainco (Private) Limited had informed the Divisional Secretary of the

change of the title and thereafter a fresh quit notice has been served on

the petitioner on 6 th October as referred above. As submitted by the

learned State Counsel before this Court the petitioner's predecessor-in-

title was given opportunity on several occasions by the Divisional

Secretary, Meerigama, to submit the documentation in support of their

claim with regard to this land since there was a dispute with regard to

the title of the said land. As observed by us several letters have been

transferred between two parties and it was agreed to conduct a survey to

resolve the matter. The petitioner has produced before this Court the

documents produced marked P27 a Tracing prepared m July 2016.

However, the petitioner has not produced the surveyor's report with

regard to the said Tracing. Learned State Counsel produces before this

Court the report submitted along with the said tracing by the same

Surveyor A.R. Jayakody, Government Surveyor. In the said report it was

referred that several requests were made to the petitioner's predecessor-

in-title to come and show the boundaries of the lands claimed by him.

But there was a delay on the part of the petitioner's predecessor to show

the boundaries but, finally on 28.04.2016 few officers from the said

2

,

company were present for the surveyor but, failed to produce any deeds

or plans before him when they were requested to produce them before

him. When they were requested to sign the documents on that day they

too have refused to sign those documents. The surveyor whilst noting

down the events took place on that day had given reasons as to why he

conclude that this Tracing he prepared on that day was a State land.

However the petitioner had not produced this part before this Court and

the learned Counsel in this regard submits that he could not obtain this

and he only could obtain the Tracing to be submitted before this Court.

The learned State Counsel during her submissions further submitted a

Plan prepared on 06.07.1976 again by the Surveyor General Department

with regard to this land and she submits that this is a land which was

acquired under the Land Acquisition Act. Even though the petitioner has

produced the documentation before this Court to show that they have

title to the land in question firstly they have failed to substantiate the

same before the government agent who requested them to produce the

said documents before him. When the surveyor went to survey the land

and requested them to produce the relevant deeds and plans to the land,

they have not only refused to submit anyone of them but they have also

refused to sign the documents with regard to the surveyor. The

petitioner's predecessor-in-title who took part in all these process in the

last minute had decided to transfer the land to the petitioner in fact two

days prior to the quit notice was issued on him. The conduct of the

3

I petitioner and the petitioner's predecessor-in-title are questionable and

therefore there is a doubt with regard to the genuineness of the

petitioner's presence in this application since he said to have spent only

2.5 million to purchase the land bordering Kandy Road to the extent of

21 acres. When considering all these matters placed before this Court

we see no merit in this application and therefore we refuse to issue notice

in this case.
