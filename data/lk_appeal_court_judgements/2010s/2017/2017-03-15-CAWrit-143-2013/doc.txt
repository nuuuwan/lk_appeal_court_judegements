JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The land including lot Nos. 16, 17 and 42 of plan No. MU. P. MARA 2322

dated 2008-05-28 produced marked 2 R 12 had been acquired by the

State in terms of section 38(a) of the Land Acquisition Act by the Gazette

Notification No. 1516/11 dated 2007-09-24 which is produced marked 2 R

7.

- -,

A notice under section 7 of the Land Acquisition Act had been published in

the Gazette Notification bearing No. 1559/13 dated 2008-07-22 which is

produced marked 2 R 13.

Lot No. 17, 16 and 42 in the plan referred to by the petitioner in his

petition are the lots in dispute in this case. They are amongst the several

lands that had been acquired by the government in terms of the provisions

of the Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 'Act').

Summary of the complaints made to this court by the Petitioner, is as

follows;

I. that he submitted an affidavit produced marked P 6 setting out his

claim to the said land together with the deed bearing No. 64 to the

Divisional Secretariat of Dickwella, after becoming aware that the

said land is to be acquired by the state;

II. that the Divisional Secretary without holding a proper inquiry, had

decided to award compensation in respect of these lands to the 5th

Respondent;

III. that the Divisional Secretary has failed to refer this dispute to the

District Court as required by section 10(3) of the Land Acquisition Act

6

in view of the rival claims to this land by both the Petitioner and the

5th Respondent.

IV. that the 1st and 2nd Respondents in making the decision to grant

compensation to the 5th Respondent without referring this dispute to

the District Court in terms of section 10(3) of the Land Acquisition Act

had therefore acted in excess of the authority rendering the said

decisions ultra vires.

It is on the above premise that the Petitioner has prayed for,

1. a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

contained in the letter dated 2012-08-07 produced marked P 18 by

the 2nd Respondent granting further compensation to the the 5th

Respondent;

2. a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash all the

decisions by the 1st and 2~d Respondents in relation to granting of

compensation to the 5th Respondent;

3. a mandate in the nature of a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision

P 10 taken by the 1st Respondent in terms of section 17 of the Land

Acquisition Act in relation to the grant of compensation to the 5th

Respondent;

7

4. a mandate in the nature of a writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 1st-

4th Respondents paying the compensation to the 5th Respondent

without complying with the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act;

5. a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus directing the 2nd

Respondent to pay the compensation to the Petitioner;

6. a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus to compel! the 2nd

Respondent to recover the compensation which had been paid so far

to the 5th Respondent or in the alternative a writ of Mandamus

directing to recover the compensation which had been paid to the 5th

Respondent from the salary of the 1st Respondent;

7. a mandate in the nature of a writ of Mandamus to compel! the 2nd

Respondent to have a proper inquiry in terms of section 9 of the

Land Acquisition Act.

As the Petitioner has claimed three different plots of land namely lot Nos.

17, 16 and 42, it is convenient for the purposes of clarity, to consider

payment of compensation in respect of each one of them separately.

8

Lot No. 17

In respect of Lot No. 17 in Plan No. MU. P. Mara 2322 the Petitioner and 2

others have submitted claims. Thereafter an inquiry in terms of section 9 of

the Act has been held. All the claimants including the Petitioner had

participated at this inquiry. These inquiry proceedings have been produced

marked 2 R 23, 2 R 24, 2 R 25 and 2 R 26. As there was a dispute

with regard to the claims to this lot, the Divisional Secretary had decided to

refer the said dispute to the District Court for a decision, in terms of

section 10(1)(a) of the Land Acquisition Act. This is clearly reflected in the

notice of his decision produced marked 2 R 27. Thus, it is the position of

the Divisional Secretary that the amount of compensation payable in

respect of lot No. 17 would be deposited in the District Court to be paid to

the person who would be entitled to it, once the District Court decides that

issue.

The Petitioner has been informed of the prevailing position with regard to

tis lot.

Thus the Petitioner cannot complain against that decision.

9

Lot No. 16

It is only the 5th Respondent who had submitted his claim in respect of Lot

No. 16 consequent to the said notice. The Divisional Secretary having held

an inquiry on 2008-11-17, under section 9 of the Act had made a decision

in terms of section 10(1) (a) of compensation to the 5th Respondent who

was the sole participant at the inquiry. This decision of the acquiring officer

has become final as there had been no application by any party for a

reference for determination in terms of section 10(2). Thus the Divisional

Secretary had proceeded to make an award on 2009-03-16, in favour of

the 5th Respondent in terms of section 17 of the Act.

The Petitioner had forwarded an affidavit produced marked P 6 with

certain documents to the Divisional Secretary on 2009-06-02 claiming

compensation for Lot No.16. However the decision under section 10 and

the award under section 17 in respect of this lot had been made by that

time. The Petitioner had been informed of this position accordingly.

The course of action available to the Petitioner if he still maintains that

compensation has been paid to the wrong person, would be under section

tI

It

57 of the Act, to recover such compensation from the person to whom it

was paid.

Lot No. 42

It is only the 5th Respondent who had submitted his claim in respect of Lot

No. 42 consequent to the notice published in the Gazette Notification

bearing No. 1559/13 dated 2008-07-22 which is produced marked 2 R 13.

The Divisional Secretary having held an inquiry on 2008-11-17, under

section 9 of the Act had made a decision in terms of section 10(1) (a) of

the Act that it is the 5th Respondent who is entitled to the compensation as

he was the sole claimant at the inquiry. This decision of the acquiring

officer has become final as there had been no application by any party for

a reference for determination in terms of section 10(2). Thus the

Divisional Secretary had proceeded to make an award, in favour of the 5th

Respondent in terms of section 17 of the Act.

11

Position taken up by the Petitioner

It is the position of the Petitioner that he submitted an affidavit dated

2009-06-02 (marked P 6) setting out his right to the said land together

with the deed bearing No. 64 to the Divisional Secretariat of Dickwella,

after becoming aware that the said land is to be acquired by the state.

This means that it is his position that it was on or about that date! that he

has become aware of the ongoing acquisition proceedings in respect of this

land.

However it must be noted that the Petitioner had by that time made a

claim in respect of Lot No. 17, and thus his name appears in the Gazette

Notification bearing No. 1559/13 dated 2008-07-22 which is produced

marked 2 R 13, by the 2nd Respondent and also by the Petitioner as P 3 B.

It is to be observed that all these lots have been mentioned in the same

Gazzette and hence the Petitioner if he had been interested in submitting a

claim in respect of any of the lots mentioned therein could not have missed

the said notice. Further the fact that his name appears in the said Gazette

notification as a person who had made a claim to another lot mentioned

therein (lot No. 17) shows clearly that he had been well aware about these

1 On 2009-06-02.

12

acquisition proceedings by that time. Thus the assertion by the petitioner

that he became aware of the acquisition proceedings on or about 2009-06-

02, to say the least, is not acceptable.

Laches

The Petitioner has filed a writ application in the Provincial High Court of

Matara bearing No. SP / HCCA / MA / Writ / 11 / 2010 on a different

ground pertaining to the same issues. A copy of the proceedings of this

case has been produced in this Court by the 5th Respondent marked as R 5

a. According to the journal entries therein, it could be seen that the

Petitioner had filed that case on 2009-12-10. The High Court of Matara had

dismissed this application on 2011-09-13.

Petitioner after 2 years and 8 months thereafter has filed the instant . . application on 2013-05-29. This is after the 2nd Respondent has informed

the Petitioner by the letter dated 2008-08-07 produced marked P 18 that

the compensation in respect of Lot No. 16 would be paid to the 5th

Respondent if the Petitioner would not take any action to pursue further

legal action subsequent to the dismissal of the case by the Provincial High

,

I . 'l I I I j I I I I I I I I

13

Court of Matara. The 2nd Respondent had granted the Petitioner time to

take such further legal action until 2012-08-17. The Petitioner has not

adduced any reason for the undue inordinate delay occurred in filing this

writ application in this court.

It has also been brought to the notice of this court that the 5th Respondent

had also filed an action in the District Court of Matara bearing No. L /

11822 seeking an interim injunction against the 5th Respondent to prevent

him from constructing a house in that land. Proceedings of this case has

been produced by the 5th Respondent marked R S d. The said case

appears to have been filed on 2010-02-10.

In the course of the averments in the pleadings of that case, the Petitioner

had stated that it has been revealed later that his father had executed the

deed No. 927 in favour of the 5th Respondent. However the District Court

of Matara had refused to issue an interim injunction in that case.

The 5th Respondent has produced a copy of the entire record of the said

case bearing No. L / 11822 marked R Sed) for the perusal of this court. (

!II

14

On the above material it is the submission of the learned counsel for the 5th

Respondent that the Petitioner has suppressed material facts when

presenting this application before this court.

It can be observed from the perusal of the petition that the Petitioner has

failed to disclose the fact that he had filed an action in the District Court of

Matara bearing No. L / 11822 seeking an interim injunction against the 5th

Respondent and that the District Court of Matara had refused to issue an

interim injunction in that case.

However the Petitioner had stated in his petition the filing and subsequent

dismissal by the High Court of Matara the case bearing No. SP / HCCA / MA

/ Writ / 11 / 2010

Conclusion

The position of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents that proper inquiries in

terms of the Land Acquisition Act were held in respect of Lot No. 16, 17

and 42 and that the disputed claims in respect of Lot No. 17 has been

referred to the District Court for a decision. It is their position that there

was no necessity to refer the matter to the District Court in terms of

ff

IIII!

II

15

section 10(3) of the Land Acquisition Act as there were no rival claims with

regard to Lot No. 16 and 42.

It has been proved to the satisfaction of this court from the above material

that the Petitioner had failed to make any claims in respect lands in Lot No.

16 and 42 in terms of the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. Therefore

the decision taken by the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents to award

compensation in respect of those lands to the 5th Respondent is fully within

their authority and hence cannot be categorized as ultra vires. The

disputed claims in respect of Lot No. 17 has already been referred by the

1 st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents to the District Court for a decision in terms of

section 10(3) of the Land Acquisition Act. That is exactly what they are

required to do by law.

What appears to this Court from the material produced by parties is that

the Petitioner has been taking up different positions with regard to his right

to the disputed lands at different times.

Further, what appears to this Court from the material set out above is that

there is a delay on the part of the Petitioner to agitate this matter before

t

tiI

16

this Court. That delay would be an undue delay as he has failed to adduce

any acceptable reason in that regard.

It would also be pertinent to state here that the Petitioner also has failed to

disclose some of the litigations he had been engaged with regard to the

claims he had made to these lands. A Petitioner in a Writ application has a

duty to place all material facts pertaining to the case. Whether such fact

the Petitioner had withheld is an important or relevant would be a matter

to be decided by Courts at a later stage of the case probably at argument

stage. Thus it is not open for him, at a later stage to say that he was not

aware of the importance of certain facts which he had omitted to place

before Cou rt. 2

The above facts vitiate the credibility of the averments of facts in the

Petition. Therefore the positions taken up by the Petitioner before this

court have become positions which this Court cannot.accept.

For the foregoing reasons and conclusions it is the view of this Court that

there is no merit in this application. Hence this court decided to refuse this

application. The filing of this application by the petitioner cannot be

justified as there is no reasonable basis for him to agitate the issues that

he had sought to agitate before this Court. Hence, we proceed to dismiss

this application with costs.
