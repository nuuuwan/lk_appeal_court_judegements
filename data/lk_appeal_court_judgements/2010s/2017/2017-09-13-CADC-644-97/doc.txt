This is an appeal against the Judgment of the Learned Additional

District Judge of Mt. Lavinia dated 25.07.1997. Being aggrieved by the

said the judgment the Defendant- Appellant instituted this appeal on the

following grounds:-

1) the said judgment dated 2517/1997 is wrong and contrary to the

law' ,

2) the rejection of the medical certificate submitted on behalf of the

Defendant-appellant was wrong and contrary to law;

3) the reasons adduced by the learned Additional District Judge in

refusing a postponement of the trial is wrong and contrary to law.

2

4) the defendant-appellant has been deprived of a fair trial in that the

case was taken up for trial on 16.06.1997 in the absent of the

defendant-appellant and her counsel;

5) the trial has been conducted in violation of principles of natural

justice and therefore the judgment dated 2517/1997 is null and void.

The plaintiff-Respondent instituted the action seeking a declaration

that Deed No.170 dated 03.09.1996 be declared null and void. The plaintiffs

position was that, the corpus in question was originally owned by her and

the defendant's mother - and the house that stood on the corpus was built by

her and the mother, and by Deed No. 64 dated 05.03.1993 the mother had

transferred the land to her sister - the defendant subsequently the sister

gifted a portion of the main land by Deed No 11 dated 25.09.1993 ( lot 1 A

1 B) and that the said Deed was irrevocable Deed of gift- and that in August,

1990 which she attempt to construct a boundary wall separating Lot lA and

1 B- a dispute arose and her sister - the Defendant cancelled the Deed of

gift by Deed No. 170 dated 03.05.1996 . The Plaintiff and the Defendant are

sisters and are Muslims. The defendant filed answer, and stated that,

originally the land was owned by her mother and was given to her and as the

3

plaintiff was seeking to obtain a loan - and at her request half share of the

land was gifted to her on the understanding that the plaintiff would be

transfer the property to her and as this did not happen she executed the Deed

of revocation No.170 dated 25.09.1993 lawfully and specifically stated that

possession of the property was never handed over to the plaintiff and on

those grounds sought the dismissal of the Plaintiffs action. No replication

was filed by the Plaintiff. The Defendant's position was under the Muslim

law as possession of the land was with her, she had the legal right to cancel

the gift. On 16.06.1997 the trial date the Attorney-at-Law for the Defendant

tendered a medical certificate stating that, the Defendant was sick the court

rejected the application for an adjournment and issues were raised by the

plaintiff. The plaintiff gave evidence according to her pleadings and the

learned District Judge in his Judgment re iterating the evidence of the

plaintiff without any evaluation or analysis granted the reliefs prayed for the

plaintiff.

The defendant appealed the principal issue raised by the Defendant

was whether Deed No.170 dated 03.09.1996 could be revoked unilaterally.

4

(This Deed was not produced by the plaintiff) and whether the judgment is

valid on the basis that, it is a perfunctory judgment with no evaluation on

analysis of the evidence led.

I am of the VIew that if the Learned District Judge needs any

clarification about the Medical Report he has to issue commission to JMO

and probe about its validity. This practice was adopted in the case of

D.K.Ranasinghe Vs.N.A. Algin 74 NLR 446.

In the said case it was held as follows:

"after several dates, when the case came up for trial on the 3rd of

October, 1968, the 1 st defendant was absent and her proctor moved for a date

tendering a medical certificate from an Ayurvedic Physician. He did not say

that in the event of his application being refused he would be unable to carry

on with whatever evidence he had, or that he was not appearing.

When the genuineness of the medical certificate was challenged, the

Court issued a commission to the J.M.O. to examine the 1 st defendant. Such

5

a step is really effective only if the J.M.O's finding can be ascertained on the

very same day. There was no agreement as to what should take place if it

was found at some future date that the medical certificate was in fact a

frivolous one.

The learned District Judge having issued this commission, held an

mqUIry on the 13th of November 1968, and by his Order dated 20th

November, 1968, held that the medical certificate tendered by the 1 st

defendant was not a genuine one. He then fixed the case for ex-parte trial.

In the circumstances of this case we are unable to say that the 1 st

defendant agreed either expressly or by implication to her defence being

struck off in the event of her application for a postponement being refused.

We set aside the order setting down the case for ex-parte trial. The case can

now be fixed for trial on a date as early as possible, as this is a very old case.

In the light of the foregoing judgment it is evident that the learned

District Judge has failed to issue commission in the present case before us.

6

Further, the learned Judge had option to impose cost. However, he

had failed to adopt that option. It was held in the case of B.V.Perera Vs.

P.Ambalavanar (70 NLR 563) that on the first date of trial, counsel

appearing for the 1 st defendant filed a medical certificate to the effect that

"Mr. B.V.S. Perera is suffering from Fibrositis of the pectoral muscle on the

left side. He will not be fit to attend Court tomorrow and for about one week

thereafter", and moved for an adjournment. Counsel for the plaintiff

objected, stating that he did not admit the genuineness of the medical

certificate. The trial Judge refused the application for an adjournment,

whereupon counsel for the 1 st defendant withdrew from the case. The trial

was held immediately thereafter as against the 1 st defendant.

I do not understand why the trial Judge acted so precipitately.

The medical certificate has all the appearances of genuineness, and, if the

statement made in it was correct, the 1 st defendant was not fit to attend court.

When plaintiffs Counsel objected to the grant of an adjournment and

challenged the genuineness of the certificate, the simple and proper course

for the Court was to require the 1 st defendant's counsel to prove the

authenticity of the certificate. If the Judge in his discretion considered that

7

the costs of the day should be borne by the 1 st defendant, an order to that

effect could have been made. Instead, the Court proceeded to trial and to

judgment without the 1 st defendant having any chance to establish that his

request for a postponement was made on proper grounds.

The judgment and decree are set aside, and a fresh trial will be held on

a date to be fixed by the District Judge. The costs of this appeal will abide

the [mal result of the action.

In the case of Weerasinghe Vs. Barlis 44 NLR 466 also the Court held

as follows. " In view of the medical certificate I allow a date. Defendant to

pay Rs.I05 as plaintiffs costs of the day".

Besides, the conduct of the learned District Judge indicates that he did

not consider the principle of natural justice specially Audi alteram partem

means " listen to the other side", or "let the other side be heard as well". It

is the principle that no person should be judged without a fair hearing in

which each party is given the opportunity to respond to the evidence against

them.

8

It is argued on behalf of the appellant the rejection of the medical

certificate by the learned District Judge deprived of her fair trial. The Court

taking into consideration following facts in the appeal:-

a) The postponement was requested on the first date of trial.

b) The medical certificate tendered had indicated that the appellant

was sick and unfit to attend court.

c) The court further note that the medical certificate does not

indicate the appellant was unfit to attend court.

d) The Court is mindful of the fact an adjournments are discouraged

by the reasons circular of the Hon. Chief Justice substantiate this

position.

e) It is an accepted fact that the Judge has a discretionary power in

considering an adjournment it is also true this discretion has to be

used judicially.

Ex-parte order to proceed with the trial in the absence of the appellant

is vital issue that has to be taken into consideration. We have taken into

consideration the cumulative effect of the above factors and Court further

observed that the ultimate aim of litigant to face fair trial and call for justice.

9

The (maxim "actus curiae neminem gravabit" which means and act

of the Court will prejudice no one. Further the (maxim actus legisneminiest

damnosus) which means and act of Law prejudices no one aud; alteram

partam which means hear the other side no one should be condemned or

heard.

There are some essential rules of procedure in administrative law.

Decisions or action taken in violation of these rules and rendered invalid on

the basis of 'procedural ultra vires' - or doing the right thing in the wrong

way. Impropriety in procedure should be avoided since it can negatively

affect the final outcome of an administrative action or a decision. Natural

Justice is a fundamental procedural requirement. The essence of natural

justice is the notion of "fair play in action" - that an administrative official

or tribunal exercising a quasi - judicial power must adhere to its two rules,

namely 1) in a dispute both parties must be given a hearing (audi alteram

partem) and 2) no person can be judge in his own cause (nemo iudex causa

sua). (Peiris 2013, 171,226)

In Mundy V. Central Environmental Authorities and others ( SC

app.58/2003) where the appellants were adversely affected by the deviation

10

from the original trace of the Southern Expressway the court recognized that

the appellants were therefore " entitled to a hearing, under the audi alteram

partem rule as well as article 12(1). It was stated that:

If it is permissible in the exercise of a judicial discretion to require a

humble villager to forego his right to a fair procedure before is compelled to

sacrifice a modest plot of land and a little hut because they are of' extremely

negligible ' vale in relation to a multi-billion rupees national project, it is

nevertheless not equitable to disregard totally the infringement of his rights :

the smaller the value of his property, the greater his right to compensation.

The reason judgment of this Court C.A.No.67/2012 dated 12.09.2016

Duglus PLC Vs. Director General o/Customs the Justice Chithrasiri referred

the case of Cooper Vs. Wands Worth Board o/Works (1863) E.R.141 Even

God did not pass sentence upon Adam, before he was called upon to make

his defence.

Taking into consideration of all these matters, we are of the opinion

that the appellant had been deprived of fair trial and fair hearing. In these

11

circumstances, the original Court may impose a cost and allowed the parties

to participate in the trial.

On foregoing adumbrated reasons we decided to set aside the order of

the learned District Judge and order a trial de novo.

Appeal allowed.
