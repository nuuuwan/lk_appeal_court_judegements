Before: A H M D Nawazl

P. Padman Surasena 1

Counsel: Shayamal A Collure for the Petitioners.

Janak De Silva Senior Deputy Solicitor General for the

Respondents.

Argued on: 2016-11-15

Decided on: 2017-01-30

JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

1st Petitioner is the mother of the 2nd Petitioner who is a minor and whose

admission to Grade 1 of Visakha Vidyalaya Colombo, was sought by an

application made by the 1st Petitioner. Upon this application being rejected

by the School, the 1st Petitioner appealed to the Secretary of the Ministry of

Education. The 1st Respondent being the then Secretary of the Ministry of I

Education had rejected the said appeal by the letter dated 2012-03-14

{,

rIf!

\

produced marked P 12. That is the document the Petitioner seeks to

challenge in this proceedings.

In challenging the said letter P 12 it is the argument of the Petitioners that

the reason contained therein to the effect that the Petitioners had not

fulfilled the required qualifications for admission of children as per the

circular No. 2011/18 is not justifiable.

It is in this backdrop that the Petitioners in their petition have prayed inter

alia for,

1. a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision of the 1st Respondent not to

admit the 2nd Petitioner to Grade One of Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo

for the year 2012, contained in the letter marked P 12 ;

II. a Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision and / or finding of the 8th to

12th Respondents made in respect of the appeal preferred by the 2nd

Petitioner, referred to in the letter P 12 ;

III. a Writ of Mandamus to compel the 2nd to 12th Respondents or any

one or more of them to admit the 2nd Petitioner to Grade One of

Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo for the year 2012 on merit and / or in

terms of the marking scheme contained in the Circular marked P 2

IV. a Writ of Mandamus in the alternative to direct and / or compel the

2nd to 12th Respondents to admit the 2nd Petitioner to the

corresponding Grade at Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo as at the final

determination of this application.

Learned counsel for the Petitioners relied on, the indenture of lease

produced marked P 12 in an attempt to show that the Petitioners were

residing in that premises at the relevant time.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General drew the attention of this court to

section ,6 of the application marked R 1 submitted by the Petitioners to

gain admission for the 2nd Petitioner to the particular school. In section 6

thereof the Petitioners have stated that they are residing in No. 9/3,

Gomes Path, Colombo 05 in the year 2010 as well.

The 1st Petitioner in the said application has solemnly undertaken to state

the truth. She has been made aware that any false information found

inserted therein would result in the rejection of her application.

Learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General next drew the attention of this

court to the indenture of lease produced marked R 3 by which the lessor

Sinha Arachchige Kalyani Silva had leased out the whole of this house to a

Ii l

Ii!I

f

I

10

third party namely, Manel Thilak Gunasinghe, for a period of one year to be

reckoned from 2010-05-01. The details given in the indenture of lease

bearing No. 4703 produced marked P 17 by which the 1st Petitioner claims

to have come to reside at the Gomes Path, Colombo 05 address, contains

her then address described as follows:

" .... holder of National Identity Card No. 72 519 1685 V of No. 352/4,

Millagahawatte, Ganemulla ... "

This shows that the Petitioners had not resided at the relevant address

(No. 9/3, Gomes Path, Colombo 05) before 2010-05-01 also. This in turn

establishes that the averment by the 1st Petitioner in her Counter Affidavit

that the Petitioners were residing in the ground floor when said Manel

Thilak Gunasinghe was occupying the upper floor lacks credibility.

It must also be borne in mind that the Petitioners complaint is that the

rejection of her application by the school authorities is wrong because she

had submitted the relevant indenture of lease bearing No. 4703 marked P

17. It is not part of their case before the school authorities that they had

shared this house with another family. Further it is for the first time that

the 1st Petitioner has taken up such a position in her counter affidavit after

11

the Respondents bringing the contents of document marked R 3 to the

attention of court.

In the light of the above facts the necessary conclusion that can be arrived

at by this court is that the Petitioners could not have been residing at the

impugned address during the whole of the year 2010. This means that the

1 st Petitioner has inserted false information in her application (R 1).

Therefore her application becomes liable for rejection on that ground

alone.

Since this court at this instance is dealing with an application for mandates

in the nature of Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus in terms of Article 140 of

the Constitution, the task before this court is only to ascertain whether

there is any ground for the issuance of such writs against the respondent

school authorities.

In the case of Jahangir Sheriffdeen and two others Vs. Sandamali

Aviruppola, Principal Visaka Vidyalaya Colombo1, relied upon by the learned

Senior Deputy Solicitor General, the Supreme Court has held as follows.

1. s.c. (F/R) Application No. 01/2015, decided on 2016-10-03

12

" ...... The above facts are disproved by his own declaration in the birth

certificate of the child.

When I consider the above matters, I hold that the Petitioners, declaration

that they, in 2009 and 2010, were living at No.50A, Edward Lane, Colombo

03, is false. The 1st Petitioner, at the end of the application marked P2, has

admitted that if the particulars in the said application (P2) are found to be

false, his application would be rejected. On this ground alone, the

application of the 1st Petitioner for school admission (P2) had to be rejected

by the school authorities. If the particulars furnished in the application

marked P2 are false, the petitioners are not entitled to the reliefs claimed

in their petition filed in this court. For the above reasons, I hold that the

application marked P2 is not a genuine one ........ "

The petitioner by stating in her application that she resided in this address

in the year 2010 has attempted to deceive the Respondent school

authorities. What had prompted the Petitioner to file this application in this

Court is the rejection of her application by the Respondent school

authorities. As has been decided by the Supreme Court in the case cited

above, in this case too the Respondent school authorities are entitled to

reject the application submitted by the 1st Petitioner on this ground alone.

In these circumstances it is clear that the action of the Respondent school

authorities in rejecting the said application submitted by the petitioner,

cannot be faulted.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we see no basis as to

why the aforesaid writs applied for by the Petitioner should be issued.

Hence we decide to dismiss this application. However, we make no order

for costs.

Application is dismissed without costs.
