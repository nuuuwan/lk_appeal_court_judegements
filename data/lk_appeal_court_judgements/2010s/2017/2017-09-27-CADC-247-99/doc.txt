The Plaintiff - Respondents (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiffs) instituted

action in the District Court of Kegalle by Plaint dated 20.06.1986 against the

Defendant - Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Defendant) for inter alia;

", 3

a) A declaration that the Plaintiff is the owner of the land described in the

Schedule to the Plaint,

b) For a declaration that the Defendant has no ownership or possession of the

said land.

c) To recover Rs. 1,0001- from the Defendant for the damages caused to him

making aggressions claiming the ownership and possession of the corpus,

during the period from 30.05.1986 - 1l.06.1986 and Rs. 100 per month

thereafter.

The Plaintiffs moved to file an amended Plaint dated 12.06.1990 and in reply the

Defendants filed answer in February 1989 praying for inter alia a dismissal of the

Plaint.

When the matter was taken up for trial on 14.02.1992 no admissions were recorded

by the parties and the Plaintiffs raised issue Nos. 01 - 12 and the Defendant raised

issue Nos. 13 - 18. The Corpus was depicted in Plan bearing No. 650 prepared by

Court Commissioner, Licensed Surveyor, M. R. Senviratne dated 22.12.1987 as

Lot 2.

The evidence of the said Licensed Surveyor, M. R. Seneviratne, the 2nd Plaintiff,

one Randenigala Gedara Dharmadasa, Clerk Registrar of Lands, Kandy was led on

behalf of the Plaintiff's and documents PI - PI O( a) were marked. The Defendants

gave evidence on his behalf and marked documents VI - V 4.

In brief the case for the Plaintiff is that they are the lawful owners of the land

described in the schedule to the Plaint and that although the Defendnat has no title

.

\

or possession of the corpus the Defendant had at several times attempted to possess

the Corpus by force which led to the institution of action bearing No. 5677 in the

Primary Court by virtue of a Section 66 application which was settled on the basis

that the Defendnat should resolve the said dispute by way of a, civil action.

However, the Counsel for the Plaintiff contends that even after such an agreement

the Defendant had not taken steps to resolve this matter by way of civil litigation

but continued to harass the Plaintiffs which resulted in the Plaintiff instituting

proceedings which are now before this Court.

The case for the Defendant is that the Defendnat possessed the corpus as morefully

described in the schedule to the Answer for more than 10 years and claims title

from one Talagaharalage Lokumanike and Talagaharalage Punchibanda and

further claims prescription over the corpus.

The parties filed their respective written submissions and the learned District Judge

delivered judgment dated 05.01.1999 in favour of the Plaintiffs. The learned

District Court Judge came to the said finding on the basis inter alia that;

a) The Plaintiffs have proved their title to the satisfaction of Court on the basis

of deeds marked as P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 and P8,

b) The Defendant has failed to identify the corpus to the satisfaction of Court

on the basis of deeds marked VI, V2 and V3.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Defendnat has preferred the instant

appeal on the grounds that the Plaintiffs have failed to identify the corpus and have

failed to prove title to same. The Defendnat further contends that the learned

~ II

.

, . 5

District Court Judge has erred in awarding damages to the Plaintiffs as the

Plaintiffs have failed to prove damages to Court.

It is pertinent to note that the evidence of the Court Commissioner, Licensed

Surveyor, M. R. Seneviratne states that there are no boundaries in between Lot 1

and Lot 2 of Plan bearing No. 650 prepared by Licensed dated 22.12.1987. As

correctly submitted by the Counsel for the Plaintiffs in a Rei Vindicatio action the

Plaintiff has the burden to identify and prove title to the corpus.

The title of the Plaintiffs stems from deed bearing No. 4460 dated 11.01.1944

(marked as P3). The learned Judge has correctly considered the description of the

boundaries in the said deed and observed that the land described in the schedule to

the amended Plaint is one and the same.

The said deed states the name of the land as 'Imbul Palaye Hena saha Watta'. The

Defendant's contention is that the corpus is named 'Galgode Hena alias

Udagewatta Hena'. As prudently noted by the learned District Court Judge the crux

of the matter to be determined by Court is whether the corpus, Lot 2 of Plan

bearing No. 650 prepared by Licensed Surveyor, M. R. Senviratne dated

22.l2.l987 is 'Imbul Palaye Hena saha Watta' or 'Galgode Hena alias Udagewatta

Hena'.

This Court finds that the learned District Court Judge has carefully examined the

boundaries of the deeds and found that the land named 'Galgode Hena alias

Udagewatta Hena' is situated east of 'Imbul Palaye Hena saha Watta'. Further it

was determined that as per Plan bearing No. 650 dated 22.12.1987 the South

I \ ! 1

f ,

boundary is noted as 'Galgode Hena' and 'Galgode Hena' is depicted East of Lot 2

and therefore that the said Lot 2 could never be 'Galgode Hena. Therefore, it can

be seen that the learned District Court Judge has considered all the evidence

carefully relating to the identity and pedigree of the Corpus and has correctly held

in favour of the Plaintiffs.

This Court agrees with the finding of the learned District Court Judge and finds

that the Plaintiff has sufficiently identified the corpus and further proved title to

same. In relation to the award of damages this Court finds that the said award is not

excessive and an award ofRs. 1,0001- from the Defendant for the damages caused

to the Plaintiff making aggressions claiming the ownership and possession of the

corpus, during the period from 30.05.1986 - 11.06.1986 and Rs. 100 per month is

found to be reasonable.

F or the reasons more fully described above this Court finds no reason to disturb the

findings of the learned District Judge dated 05.01.1999. Therefore this Appeal is

dismissed with costs set at Rs. 15,000/-.

Appeal Dismissed.
