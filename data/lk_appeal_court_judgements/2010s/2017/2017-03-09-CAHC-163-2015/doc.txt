S. DEVIKA DE LIVERA TENNEKOON J

The Accused - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) was

indicted in the High Court of Hambantota case bearing No. HC/2112/2005 on

15.03.2006 on the charge of having caused the death of one Wickramasinghe

Arachchilage Thilakaratne on or about 24.12.2001 at Netol Poruwa within the

territorial jurisdiction of that Court and thereby having committed the offence of

murder punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code.

After the establishment of the High Court of Tangalle the High Court of

Hambantota case bearing No. HC/2/12/2005 was transferred to the High Court of

Tangalle as case bearing No. T.H.C. 26/2006 and on 28.06.2011 the contents of the

indictment were read over to the Appellant and the Appellant pleaded not guilty.

Trial commenced in the High Court of Tangalle on 01.04.2013 with the evidence

ofPWl Samarasekara Liyanaarachchige Kanthi who was the wife of the deceased.

The brother of the deceased Wickramasinghe Arachchige Lalith Priyantha

thereafter gave evidence as PW2. Both PWI and PW2 were the only eye witnesses

to the murder of the deceased and after their evidence was led Lekamge Berty

Maximus Fernando who was the Consultant Judicial Medical Officer who gave

evidence as PW5, retired Inspector Police Karunamuniratne Ranjith Silva

Karunaratne who served at the Weeraketiya Police Station at the time material to

the murder of the deceased gave evidence as PW6, Sub-Inspector of Police

attached to the Hakmana Police Station Rajapurage Premathileke gave evidence as

PW7, Police Officer Abeyratne Kankanamge Wijedasa gave eviendence as PW8

and Police Constable Punchihewage Anura and interpreter Nanda Hatharasinghe

gave evidence as PW9 and PWI 0 respectively.

The Prosecution closed its case by leading the aforesaid evidence and marked as

productions PI - the shirt worn by the deceased at the time of death, P2- the post-

mortem report, P3 - a mammoty and P5 - the statutory statement.

The case for the prosecution in brief is that the on or around the 24.12.2001 PWI

(the wife of the deceased) and PW2 (the brother of the deceased) were returning

from the "koratuwa" in the rain when the Appellant allegedly attacked the

deceased on the head with a mammoty from behind at which point the deceased

screamed "buddhu ammo" after which the Appellant fled the scene. PWI had

fainted after seen what happened to the deceased and PW2 had chased behind the

Appellant but to no avail and had thereafter returned to where the deceased lay.

The defence marked 3 omissions of PWI and marked as VI -V5 her

contradictions. The contradictions ofPW2 were marked as V6 - VII.

The Defence thereafter made an application under Section 200( 1) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure to acquit the Appellant without calling for a defence and the

I i , f i ! ! t , ! !

learned High Court Judge by his order dated 29.04.2015 dismissed the said

application and called for the defence in the instant case.

The Defence was by means of a dock statement, made by the Appellant on

06.07.2015 by which the Appellant provided a supposed alibi, in that he stated that,

he was at the residence of his mother and brother in Arauwwala in Maharagama at

the time of the incident as he had gone to lodge his pregnant wife with his family.

The learned High Court Judge delivered the impugned Judgment dated 01.10.2015

and convicted the Appellant on the aforementioned charge and sentenced him to

death.

Being aggrieved by the said Judgment the Counsel for the Appellant raised the

following grounds of Appeal;

1) That the learned trial Judge has decided that the Appellant is guilty of the

offence even before considering the defence of Alibi,

2) The learned High Court Judge has not taken into consideration the

contradictions and the omissions,

3) The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that the prosecution has

failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, and

4) The judgment and the sentence are contrary to law and the weight of the

evidence adduced.

Before considering whether the learned High Court Judge had erred in law by not

giving due weight to the evidence of the defence of Alibi as stated by the Appellant

in his dock statement I shall first consider whether the omissions and the

contradictions marked VI - VII were considered by the learned Trial Judge.

PW1 in her statement made to the Weeraketiya Police Station, around 7.00 - 7. 30

pm on the day in question, only moments after the attack on her husband, did not

state that she saw the Appellant striking the deceased on the head with a mammoty,

but that she saw the Appellant in flight after the assault. This has been marked as

the 1 st omission (vide page 77 of the Appeal brief). In the Non - summary inquiry

at the Magistrate's Court in case bearing No. 73869 on 17.10.2002 PW1 re-affirms

her stance that she only saw the Appellant running away from her husband. This

has been marked as contradiction V2 (vide page 77 and 78 of the Appeal brief). At

the inquest PW1 maintains her position that she only saw the Appellant running,

and this has been marked as a contradiction V3 (vide page 78 of the Appeal brief).

However when giving evidence in chief PW1 states that she saw the Appellant

striking the deceased with the mammoty (vide page 61 of the Appeal brief) and

confirms this during cross examination (vide page 77 of the Appeal brief).

However, upon being pressed at cross examination PW1 goes on to admit that

what she has stated at the inquest and at the Magistrates Court is false and that she

is been honest at the trial stage.

It is pertinent to note at this stage that as per the evidence of PW5 the Consultant

Judicial Medical Officer there were two (2) external injuries observed on the

deceased and as per P2 the post-mortem report the death was caused due to

"Cranio - Cerebral injury caused by a blunt force trauma to the head" and it was

observed that "there were depressed fractures in the skull with Laceration of the

brain". Therefore it may be said that the deceased was attacked twice with a blunt

object.

One may therefore assume that the deceased screamed "budhu ammo" when the

first blow to the head was made at which stage the PW1 quickly looked back to

supposedly, either to see the Appellant in flight after the assault or to see the

Appellant assault the deceased with a mammoty for the second time before running

away.

Omissions 2 and 3 were marked where PW 1 omitted in her statement to the Police

and at the inquest that she had seen PW2 walking ahead of her on the road at the

time material to the incident. It is material at this point to note that PW 1 in her

evidence has stated that the road in which the incident occurred was a straight road

(vide page 82 and 83 of the Appeal brief).

PW2 had clearly indicated in the Magistrate's inquiry that he did not see the

deceased when he entered the road in question. At the trial PW2 consistently

maintains that he joined the main road in question from a by-road at which point he

saw his brother, the deceased, walking towards him and that they both continued

on their way home, PW2 travelling ahead of the deceased. It must be noted that he

denies seen PWI at the time of the before the assault on the deceased. Thereafter

PW2 states in evidence that he heard the deceased scream "budhu ammo" at which

point he looks back and sees the Appellant striking the deceased twice before

fleeing the scene (vide page 120 and 121 of the Appeal brief). He further states

categorically that PWI was not at the scene at the time of the assault and that he

was the first to get to the deceased (vide page 123 of the Appeal brief) and PWI

was next to the deceased only after PW2 returned to where the deceased lay after

giving chase to the Appellant.

Considering the nature of the omissions and contradictions discussed above this

Court is of the view that they do in fact go to the root of this case and serious doubt

is created by the omissions and contradictions of PWI and PW2 the only eye

witnesses in the instant case.

7

As per the version of PWI, PW2 was traveling ahead of her on a straight road

when the deceased screamed "budhu ammo" at which point both PWI and PW2

allegedly rushed to the side of the deceased. PW 1 had omitted to state soon after

the incident that PW2 was there at the scene. Further, PW2 maintains that PWI

was not at the scene immediately after the attack and that it was PW2 who rushed

to the side of the deceased first. PW2 also maintains that he witnessed 2 blows as

aforementioned. This however is highly implausible as the deceased would have

screamed "budhu ammo" before being attacked and if that were the case PWI

ought to have seen the Appellant attacking the deceased and PW2 rushing towards

the deceased.

Serious doubt is raised as to why PWI omitted in her statement to the Police and at

the inquest (omissions 2 and 3) that she had seen PW2 walking ahead of her on the

road at the time material to the incident when it is evident that she could not have

missed him and vice versa.

As submitted by the learned Counsel for the Appellant it is interesting to note that

the murder weapon was in the possession of PWI. It was PWI who had given the

said weapon to the police on the following day. Interestingly the mammoty which

was supposedly broken at the time of the incident as a result of the sheer force by

which the deceased was assaulted, was given over to retired Inspector of Police

Karunamuniratne Ranjith Silva Karunaratne PW6 in the complete form. This Court

is seriously concerned about how the wife of the deceased PWl, who is

predisposed to faint at the sight of blood, could have assembled the alleged murder

weapon still stained with the blood of her husband and to have given it over to the

police on the next day. Moreover, neither PWI nor PW2 explains why or how the

murder weapon was removed from the scene and tampered and why only the

8

banana leaf that the deceased was carrying to cover his head from the rain was

found at the place of the incident.

It is now pertinent for this Court to consider the time of the incident as narrated by

two eye witnesses. Both eye witnesses admit that it was raining at the time of the

incident. PWI is certain that incident occurred around 6.00 - 6.30 pm. PW2

testified that he usually leaves the field around 6.00pm but on the day in question

he left around 4.00 - 4.30 pm since it was raining. (vide page 98 of the Appeal

brief) Upon being cross examined PW2 confirms that he the incident occurred

around 4.00pm (vide page 98 of the Appeal brief). It is therefore evident that PWI

and PW2 are at a variance when stating the time on which the incident occurred, a

discrepancy which again goes to the root of the instant case. The light conditions at

4.00 - 4.30 pm and 6.00 - 6.30 pm are different. And one can assume that with the

prevalent rain conditions ones vision may be impaired at close to 6.30 pm where as

in such impediment would not necessarily arise closer to 4.00pm. The question

then is what time could the alleged incident have occurred?

This Court finds that the prosecution has failed to establish a key element in the

narrative that led to the death of the deceased by not adequately establishing the

time at which the incident occurred. A prudent observer may nevertheless, point

out, that if the vision of eye witnesses PWI and PW2 were so impaired to the

extent of not been able to have consistently corroborated on each others presence at

the time of the incident, could either of them have effectively identified the

Appellant?

Although the learned DSG on behalf of the Respondent contends the

aforementioned omissions and contradictions are minor discrepancies this Court

cannot agree to such and holds that these omissions and contradictions go to the

9

root of the instant case and have therefore created reasonable doubt as to the guilt

of the Appellant.

I shall now consider whether the learned trial Judge has decided that the Appellant

is guilty of the offence even before considering the defence of Alibi. On perusing

the impugned judgment it seems that as submitted by the learned Counsel for the

Appellant the learned High Court Judge has concluded after an evaluation of

PWI 's evidence that the Appellant was directly involved with the death of the

deceased (vide page 173 of the Appeal brief). The learned trial Judge thereafter re-

affirms her conclusion after evaluating the evidence of both PWI and PW2 and

states that it has been established that it was the Appellant who caused the death of

the deceased (vide page 175 of the Appeal brief). She further concludes that it has

been established by the evidence of PWI and PW2 that the death concerned was

due to the Appellant striking the deceased with a mammoty. She then finds that the

injuries as referred to by PW5 were caused as a result of the Appellant striking the

deceasded with a mammoty and it is specifically stated that the learned trial Judge

has already decieded that the Appellant has committed the criminal act concerned

and therefore that the Appellant ought to be guilty of having committed murder

(vide page 178 and 179 of the Appeal brief). It is only thereafter that the learned

trial judge has considered the dock statement made by the Appellant.

In the unreported case C.A. No. 225/2009 W.L.R. Silva J states thus;

"The learned High Court Judge when he concluded that the case has been

proved beyond reasonable doubt in the middle part of page 179 has

prematurely decided that the chargers against the accused - appellant were

proved beyond reasonable doubt. Having come to that conclusion, it is

thereafter that he had proceeded to examine the evidence given by the

10

accused. The learned High Court Judge should have considered the totality

of the evidence before he came to a finding that the chargers against the

accused - appellant were proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is repugnant to

law and against all principles and norms to decide at the end of the

prosecution case without considering the evidence for the defence that the

chargers have been proved against the accused beyond reasonable doubt."

When considering the burden of proving a case beyond reasonable doubt it is

imperative that I mention two fundamental principles in English Common Law

which illustrate the opinion of this Court in that regard. In the landmark case

Woolmington v DPP [1935] AC 462 the House of Lords first articulated the

presumption of innocence principle and Lord Viscount Sankey stated thus;

"Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is

always to be seen that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner's

guilt subject to ... the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory

exception. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable

doubt, created by the evidence given by either the prosecution or the

prisoner ... the prosecution has not made out the case and the prisoner is

entitled to an acquittal. No matter what the charge or where the trial, the

principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of

the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be

entertained. "

The presumption of innocence is embedded in our Constitution in the Chapter

containing fundamental rights and Article 13(5) reads;

"Every person shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty"

In this context and for the reasons as morefully described above this court is of the

view that the learned High Court Judge had erred in law by not giving due regard

to the omissions and contradictions as discussed above and further that the learned

trial Judge has misdirected herself in law by concluding on the guilt of the

Appellant without first evaluating the dock statement.

F or the aforesaid reasons this appeal is allowed. I set aside the conviction and

sentence of the learned High Court Judge dated 01.10.2015 and acquit the Accused

- Appellant.

Appeal Allowed.
