The Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 3rd Respondent) had filed an information in the Primary

Court of Balangoda under section 66 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure

Act, complaining to the learned Primary Court Judge about an existence of

breach of peace between 2nd Party - Respondents-Petitioners (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 1st and 2nd Petitioners or Petitioners) and the

1 st Party Petitioners-Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the 1st and 2nd Respondents or Respondents) .

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this complaint, had by

his order dated 2008-09-09, concluded that the Petitioners are entitled to

the possession of the land in dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge, the Respondents had filed an application for revision in the

Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden at Ratnapura

urging the Provincial High Court to revise the order made by the learned

Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties pronounced its judgment

dated 2015-07-15 revising the order of the learned PrimarY Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court in that judgment had held that it is the

Respondents who are entitled to the possession of the impugned land.

It is against that judgment that the Petitioners have filed this revision

application in this Court.

It is admitted by the parties that;

i. the impugned land was not cultivated for some period of time

owing to the then ongoing Badulla - Ratnapura road widening

activities,

ii. the Petitioners first started cleaning this land on 2008-05-111,

iii. the information under section 66 (1) was filed in Court by the

Police on 2008-05-26.

The 1st Petitioner has stated in his statement to Police as well as in his

affidavit filed in the Primary Court that he had commenced cultivating this

land after he purchased this land on 2008-04-25. 1st Petitioner claims to

list Petitioners statement to Police (3'~ 1 en )

7

have purchased this land from the 2nd Petitioner and the father of the 2nd

Petitioner after doing a search of title at the relevant land registry.2

It is the 2nd Petitioner's position in the affidavit filed by him in the Primary

Court that he had inherited this land from his mother.

It is the Respondents' position;

i. that this land being a property donated to the church by one of its

parishioners, was being harvested for a long time on behalf of the

church,

ii. that owing to the road widening activities harvesting could not be

done for several years,

iii. that the Petitioners entered this land when the preliminary activities

such as spraying weedicides were being done as preparations for

cultivation,

iv. that this land is situated adjoining to the elders home run by the

church.

2 Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the affidavit filed by the 1st Petitioner in the Magistrate's Court.

8

Indeed the fact that weedicide had been sprayed is corroborated by the

observations made by Sub Inspector Jayaweera on 2008-05-15. Further

neither of the Petitioners has ever taken up the position that they sprayed

weedicide in their claimed run up to cleaning this land for cultivation. Thus

the fact that it is the Respondents who had first commenced cleaning

activities for cultivation has been established before Courts.

The fact that the name of the church is registered as the owner in the

agricultural land register maintained in the Agrarian Services Centre also

corroborates the position of the Respondents and would militate against

the Petitioners' positions.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that the learned High

Court Judge was correct when she held that it is the Respondents who are

entitled to the possession of this land.

Learned counsel for both parties submitted before this Court that there is a

case fixed for trial in the District Court with regard to this land. Hence, the

rights of the parties could finally be adjudicated as has been provided for in

section 74 of the Primary Courts Procedure Act.

In these circumstances this Court sees no merit in this application.

the same. The Respondents are entitled to costs.

Application is dismissed with costs.
