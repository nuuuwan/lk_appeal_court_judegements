The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kurunegala under

Section 296 of the Penal Code. Mter trial he was convicted for murder and

was sentenced to death.

Learned counsel for the accused-appellant argued that there was

cumulative provocation which amounts to culpable homicide not

amounting to murder. Learned DSG concedes that there has been

cumulative provocation but moves if the sentence is varied it should be a

heavy sentence.

Considering the evidence given by the two daughters of the deceased we

find that there has been cumulative provocation and also from the evidence

of the accused-appellant, we see that there has been cumulative

provocation. Considering all these we convict the accused for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder and bring down the sentence of death

to 15 years rigorous imprisonment. The sentence should operate from the

date of conviction.
