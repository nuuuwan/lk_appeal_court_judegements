Oeepali Wijesundera J.

The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of

Anuradhapura under section 54 a (c) of Act no. 13 of 1984 for possession

of heroin, and under section 54 a (b) of the said Act for trafficking of heroin.

He was convicted for life imprisonment on both charges after trial. This

appeal is from the said conviction and sentence.

The story of the prosecution is that on 25th of November 2010 a police

party lead by prosecution witness Chief Inspector Ruwan Kantha have left

the police station on receipt of some information and had conducted the raid

on the 27th. They have stopped a lorry at Pubbogama Junction, the driver

has opened the door and run away with the ignition key. The passenger the

appellant, was searched and heroin was recovered tucked into his sarong

and he was arrested.

The evidence of the Chief Inspector Ruwan Kantha shows the vehicle

was driven to the Police Station using another key which the appellant's

learned counsel said is not probable. On perusal of evidence I find that this

item of evidence has not been challenged in the trail court, therefore that

argument fails.

In Sarwan Sing vs State of Punjab 2002 AIR 111 it was held that "it

is a rule of essential justice that whenever the opponent has declined to

avail himself of the opportunity to put his case in cross examination, it must

follow that the evidence tendered on that issue ought to be accepted. "

In Motilal vs State of Madya Pradesh 1990 CCLJ NOC 125 MP it

was held, "absence of cross examination of prosecution witness of certain

facts leads to inference of admission of that fact. "

Appellant while giving evidence has taken up the position that while

he was at home Asanka came with another person and left a parcel at his

house. Thereafter the person who came with Asanka opened the parcel and

arrested the appellant. The learned counsel for the appellant argued that

the learned High Court Judge has referred this as an alibi but it is not an

alibi which amounts to a misdirection. He also stated due to these the

appellant did not get a fair hearing. This argument of the learned counsel is

not correct, the learned High Court Judge has concluded that he would not

analyse the evidence of the appellant on the basis of an alibi whilst doing

so he has properly analysed the evidence placed before him and has

concluded that the evidence of the defence does not create a doubt on the

prosecution evidence. I find that this observation is correct.

In King vs Marshall 51 NLR 157 it was held;

':4n alibi is not an exception to criminal liability, like a plea of

private defence or grave and sUdden-provocation. An alibi is

nothing more than an evidentiary fact, which, like other facts

relied on by an accused, must be weighed in the scale against the

case for the prosecution. N

Considering the totality of the evidence presented by the prosecution

I find that they have discharged their burden to prove their case beyond

reasonable doubt. For these I find that the learned High Court Judge has

analysed the evidence applying several tests properly. Therefore I am not

inclined to set aside a well considered judgment.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to affirm the judgment dated

09/06/2016 and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
