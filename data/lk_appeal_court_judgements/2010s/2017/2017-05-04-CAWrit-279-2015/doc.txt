ORDER

Petitioner Sussex Educational Services Limited previously known as

Ceylinco Sussex Educational Services Limited had employed the 3rd

Respondent as a Teacher from 16th October 2006 to 15th October 2007.

(P2B) According to the letter of appointment he wi]] be working at

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 2114

Ambalangoda, among other conditions, both parties namely the Petitioner

and the 3rd Respondent will be contributing for EPF and ETF. Para 9

of the said letter of appointment states as follows.

9. It will be necessary for you to join the Employees

Provident Fund and contributions to the fund will be in

terms of Employees Provident Fund Act and regulations

.fiamed there under.

10. You will be entitled to the contributions to the Employees

Trust Fund in terms of the provisions of the Employees

Trust Fund Act and regulations framed there under.

The Petitioner submits that the 3rd Respondent had reached 57 years

when he was employed and submits a copy of the National Identity

Card as P2A. As per the said National Identity Card the 3rd Respondent

was born as 23 rd April 1949. At the time of joining the Petitioner

Company 3rd Respondent was 57 years and 5 months. 3rd Respondent

continued working with the Petitioner with periodical extensions of

the contract. As per P2D the 3rd Respondent was' appointed as a

Principal and placed at Matara branch. In the letter of appointment, it

was stated that the 3rd Respondent will not be entitled for EPF

because he is over 55 years. For easy reference I reproduce paragraph

2 of the said letter of appointment P9 as below.

"You will be paid an all inclusive allowance of Rs. 35,0001-

YOli will not be entitled for EPF and ETF. "

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 3/14

The same condition continues, In 2012 when the contract was extended.

It is admitted by petitioner In para 23 of the petition that EPF was

paid from 2006 to October 20 I O. Thereafter on the basis of express

temlS set out in the said letter of appointment as extensions payment

of EPF was discontinued.

The 2nd Respondent issued a determination on the petitioner for the

payment and recovery of EPF from October 2009 to November 2012

and the amount stated as Rs. 223693 with a penalty of Rs. 111846 total

of Rs. 335539.80. This final notice is marked as P3 and filed with

the petition. Thereafter an action was instituted at" the Magistrate Court

of Matara under case No. 20138 for non payment of EPF. The

summons IS marked as P4 and produced with the petition.

The Petitioner seeking to quash the certificate filed by the 2nd .

Respondent which is marked as P6.

The Respondents raised an objection for unexplained delay in filing

this application hence moves to reject this application inlimine.

On peruSIng the available materials it was found that final notice of

action was given by the 2nd Respondent by letter dated 9th May 2014

(P3) since there was no response, an application was filed at the

Magistrate Court dated 22.08.2014. (P7 impugned document). This

application was filed on the 3rd July 2015 in this Court. There IS a

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 4/14

delay of 11 months in filing this application. The Petitioner had not

explained the delay in his petition.

For the sake of completeness I proceed further to see the legal

argument taken by the Petitioner in this case.

The Petitioner submits that any person who is employed after 55 years

is not entitled to join the EPF program' in Sri Lanka. Because the Act

provides the withdrawal after 55 year.s for Male and 50 years for

Female.

The Petitioner submits that the 3rd Respondent was a retired public

officer and when he joins a private sector which is covered by EPF

Act, is not entitled for EPF. When the Counsel made submission in

Court he crystallized his argument by saying that no one can join the

EPF program after 55 years, if it is Male and 50 if Female. Counsel

for the Respondent refute the claim and submitted there is no age

limit for anyone to join (subject to other laws) and if the employment

is a "Covered Employment", under EPF Act it will be mandatory to

contribute the EPF.

I refer Section 8 of the EPF act. It states as follows:

(1) Any employment, including any employment in the service of

a corporation whose capital or a part of whose capital is

pr~'!:d!?d brv tin? Government, ;;W;, h;r rti/ilul.1ii"t1fi htt .l'.,.,l."rfi'a

to be a covered employment.

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 5/14

(2) Regulations may be made-

(a) to treat as a covered employment any employment outside

Sri Lanka which is for the plilposes of a trade or business

carried on in Sri Lanka and which would be a covered

employment if it were in Sri Lanka,' and

(b) to treat as not being a covered employment or to

disregard.

(i) employment under a person who employs less than a

prescribed minimum number of employees;

(ii) employment of a person in the service or for the

pwposes of the trade or business, or as a partner,

of that person's spouse.

(3)Subject to the other provisions of this Act, every person over

a prescribed age who is employed by any other person in

any covered employment shall be an employee to whom this

Act applies. For the purposes of this subsection different ages

may be prescribed for different covered employments-

(4) Any regulation declaring any employment to be a covered

employment may provide that such persons only as earn less

than a prescribed amount in that employment or as are of a

prescribed class or description, and not other persons in that

employment, shal1 be employees to whom this Act applies.

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 6/14

According to the above Section it is cleared who can JOIn the EPF . ., It was in the minds of the representatives of the people, to legislate

such an act for the benefit of the Employees. That is why they made

these contribution as mandatory and not optional. In fact they made

failure to contribute an offence.

When we read Section 8 of the said act it is clear that, "every persoll

over a prescribed age wlto is employed by any otlter person in an}'

covered emplol'mellt. Shall be an employee to whom tltis act

applies. "

It is prudent to consider Section 10 and 15 of the said act. It reads as

follows;

Section 10:

(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section

and of section 27, an employee to whom this Act applie~

shall, ill respect of each mOl1th during which he works in a

covered employment, be liable to pay to the Fund a

contribution of an amount equal to eight per centum of

his total earnings from that employment during that

month.

(2) Subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section

and of section 27, the employer of every employee to

It) puy

contributions to the Fund shall, in respect of each month

C.A.Writ Application No.279j2015 Page 7114

Section 15:

during which such employee is in p covered employment

under sllch emp'!oyer, be liable to pay to the Fund on or

before the last day of the succeeding month, a

contribution of an amount equa,J. to twelve per centum of

sllch employee's total earning fi'om that employment

during that month.

Payment of contributions due from employees.

The employer of an employee to whom this Act applies

shall deduct and pay toe the Fund the contribution for

each month of such employee under this Act before the

last day of the succeeding month from the earnings of

such employee; and a contribution paid under this section

to the Fund by such employer on behalf of such employee

shall be deemed to have been paid to the Fund by such

employee.

The Petitioner submits that the Employee on reaching 55 years (If it

IS a male and 50 years to female) can collect his benefit. Therefore

no one can join after 55 years of age. Considering the relevant sections

which deals with section 23 of the said act, it reads as follows:

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 8/14

Section 23.

Time at which benefits will be paid off.

( 1) Save as hereinafter provided in this section and subject to

the deductions made in section 22, a member of the Fund

shall be paid the total amount lying to the credit of such

member's individual account as soon as may be practicable:

(a) after sllch member, being a male, attains the age of fifty-

five years, or being a female, attains the age of fifty

years, or

(b) after such member, being a female, ceases to be employed

in consequence of marriage, or

(c ) after sllch member ceases to be employed by reasons of a

permanent and total incapacity for work and is certified

by a registered medical practitioner to be unfit for work

any longer for that reason, or

(d) before the date of sllch member's departure from Sri Lanka if such member declares in writing that such departure IS

with the intention of not returning to Sri Lanka, or

(e) after such member ceases to be employed in a covered

employment and takes up pensionable employment-

(i) in the public service;

(ii) in the Local government Service constituted by the

Local Government Service Act, No 16 of 1974;

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 9/14

(iii) 111 the District Service established under sfFtion 47

of the Development Councils Act, No. 35 of 1980;

(iv) 111 the service of any local authority other than as a

member of the Local government Service;

(f) after sllch member-

(i) ceases to be employed in a business undertaking,

upon establishment of a public corporation for the

purpose of taking over and carryll1g on such

business undertaking, by an Incorporation Order

made under section 2 of the Conversion of

Government Owned Business Undertakings into

Public Corporations Act, No. 22 of 1987, and has

not taken up employment in the public corporation

so established:

(ii) ceases to be employed 111 a public corporation or

business undertaking, as the case may he, upon

incorporation of public company for the purpose of

taking over the functions of such public corporation

or taking over and carrying on such business

undertaking, as the case may be, by an Order made

tinder section 2 oft he Conversion of Public corporations

or Government Owned Business Undertakings into

Public Companies Act, No. 23 of 1987, and has not

taken up employmltnt in thft public company NO

incorporated;

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 10114

(iii) ceases to be employed in a public corporation upon

retrenchment of that member;

(iv) ceases to be employed in a public corporation upon

the dissolution of that public corporation or the

closure of t he business undertaking of that public

cOlporation:

Provided that, l-l'here a member of the Fund, being a

male, continues to work in a covered employment after he

has attained the age of fifty-jive years, or, being a female,

continues to work in a covered employment after she has

attained the age of fifty years, such member shall not be

entitled to the payment under the preceding provisions of

this section until sllch member ceases to be in sllch

employment:

Provided, further, that a member of the Fund shall not be

entitled to withdraw any sum standing to his credit in his

individual account more than once in a period of jive

years.

In this section-

(i) "business undertaking" means any business undertaking

acquired by, or vested in, the Government under the

Business Undertakings (Acquisition) Act, No. 35 of

1971,'

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 11114

(ii) "public corporation" shall have the same meaning as

111 the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist

Republic of Sri Lanka:

(iii) "registered medical practitioner" means a medical

practitioner registered under the Medical Ordinance;

and

(iv) "retrenchment" shall have the same meaning as in

the Industrial Di~putes Act.

(2) The Commissioner of Labour may, where he has reason to

doubt the genuineness of a Medical Certificate submitted by a

member under paragraph ( c )of subsection (]) of this section, refer

the member concerned for re-examination by a duly constituted

Medical Board or a Government Medical Officer and where on

such re-examination the original Medical Certificate is found to

be false in any material particular, the Commissioner shall reject

such certificate, and he shall be entitled to refuse to accept

future medical certificates issued by such registered medical

practitioner.

Considering the entire Act especially Sections 8, ] 0, ] 5 and 23. I find

that there is a mInimum age to join the EPF but there is no

maximum age to join the said Fund. Further it is mandatory under

the Act to contribute to the said fund and there are no exceptions

other than provided by the said Act.

C.A.Writ Application No.279/2015 Page 12114

On the question of interpretation of Statutes, the Chief Justice Sharvananda,

in the case of Tel1llllUkooll v Thellekoo.ll 1986 I SLR 90 cited the

following passage from R. v. Sheen 28 L.J.M. 9, wherein the Court

held:

Whenever the language of a legislature admits of two

constructions and, if construed in one 'way, would lead to obvious

injustice the courts act upon the view that such a result could

not have, been intended: unless the intention had been

manifested in e:xpress words. It is a cardinal, rule, governing

the intelpretation of statutes that when the language of the

legislature admits of two constructions, the court should not

adopt a construction which would lead to an absurdity or obvious

il?iustice. "

It is also held on the case of Wickremaratne V. Samarawickrema

and others 1995 2 SLR 212 S. N. Silva CJ held:

"The basic rule of interpretation is that the legislative objective

should be advanced and that the provisions be interpreted in

keeping with the purpose of the legislature, Interpretation should

not have the effect of defeating the objective of the Legislature

and of detracting ./i'om its purpose. "

Considering the entire EPF Act, I find that there IS no Prohibition of

joining anyone who is above 55 years (if female 50 years).

It is in fact mandatory for all employers, who are covered, to

contribute the said fund if not, it is a punishable offence under the

EPF Act.

I also observed that the Petitioner had contributed EPF on the 3rd

Respondent employee at the initial stage even though the 3rd Respondent

was above 55 years. Suddenly the petitioner stopped the contribution

to the EPF. Conduct of the petitioner contradict his submissions III

Court. I find that the conduct of the petitioner is now estoped.

Considering all, I find that the petitioner is liable to contribute under

EPF Act and the Court refuse to grant Writ of Certiorari to quash the

said order at P6.

This deals with the payment of an employee's EPF, hence, I order cost

on the petitioner and I fix it at Rs. 12,500.00.

Application dismissed with cost.
