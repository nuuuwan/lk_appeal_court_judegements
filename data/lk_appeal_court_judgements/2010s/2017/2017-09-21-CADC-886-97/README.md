The plaintiff-appellant has preferred this appeal to set aside

the judgment dated 29.04.1997 and for further relief as prayed in the

prayer of the petition dated 27.06.1997.

The plaintiff-appellant instituted this action to partition the

land called "Rukgahamulakotuwe Watte" stating inter alia that;

a) The original owner of the land was one Ukku.

b) Said Ukku transferred his rights to Kirisanda by deed No.47179.

c) Said Kirisanda by unknown deed number transferred to Laisa

1/20 shares.

d) Said Laisa transferred her 1/20 shares to the 8th and 9th

defendants.

e) Laisa died and the remaining share devolved on Mancho and

Ranso.

f) Mancho died leaving as her heirs the plaintiff and the 1 st and 2nd

defendants.

g) Ranso died leaving as her heirs 3rd, 4th 5th, 6th and 7th defendants.

Accordingly, plaintiff-appellant claimed that the said land

should be partitioned according to the pedigree shown in the plaint.

The 8th and 9th defendant-respondents also stated inter alia

that the original owner was one Langamuwe Niktenna Malinda. After his

death his son Rankira became the owner to the land in question. Rankira

transferred his rights by Deed No.23354 dated 11.10.1894 to Ukku. After

the Ukku's death Punchina became entitled to the land in question. After

Punchina's death her only child Laisa become the sole owner of the land

in dispute and thereby the 8th and 9th defendants become entitled to the

land in question and prayed to dismiss the plaint.

In this matter both parties admitted and identified corpus of

the dispute and the original owner of land is named Ukku.

However, it is important to examine whether there is a

inconsistency in the judgment dated 29.04.1997 when trial District Judge

answering the Issue No.1 and 5.

The plaintiff-appellant proved that the original owner Ukku

executed the deed No.47179 marked as PI in 1936 in favour of Kirisanda

of his undivided % shares.

(The judgment at page No.18S)

Therefore, it is clearly coming to the findings that Kirisanda

became the owner of undivided % shares of the land in dispute.

However, 8th and 9 th defendants position which is taken by

them in their statement of claim is that after Ukku's death her only son

Punchina became entitled to the land in dispute, although, 8th and 9th

defendants failed to prove their position taken by them in their statement

of claim.

In the case of Gunasekera and another vs. Latiff 1999 1

SLR pg.36S, it was held-

"While Section 101 of the Evidence Ordinance is concerned

with the duty to prove a case as a whole, viz the overall burden

of proof Section 103 regulates the burden of proof as to a

particular fact, however the devolution of the overall burden is

governed by section 102 which declares that the burden of

proof lies on that person who would fail if no such evidence at

5

f I I! I I t , f

all were gIven on either side. When the legal title to the

premises is admitted or proved to be in the plaintiff the burden

of proof is on the defendant to show he is in lawful possession

- defendant must begin the case."

Therefore, there is no dispute that Kirisanda got rights from

Ukku from the deed marked as PI.

The said Kirisanda married to a women named as

Polwattalage Gedera Laisa and who died in 1930s. From their marriage

they had two children named as Mancho and Ranso. Laisa entered into a

second marriage with Dummalahenegedera Kirihatana after the death of

Kirisanda. From that marriage she had two children who are 8th and 9th

defendants.

According to the evidence it is clear Mancho, Ranso, 8th and

9th defendants are children of Laisa.

However, Kirisanda transferred 1/20 shares by an unknown

deed which was not proved to the said Laisa and she transferred her

shares to her two sons 8th and 9th defendants-respondents by deed

No.24448 of 16.09.1968.

In these circumstances, Mancho, Ranso and 8th and 9th

defendants are co-owners of the land in dispute. Therefore, it is important

to examine whether 8th and 9th defendants have acquired a prescriptive

title against their own half-sisters.

6

f Ii ! 1 ! ! I l l !

!I

!t 1The plaintiff and 1-7 respondents are the heirs of the Mancho Iand Ranso. Therefore, plaintiff and all other defendants are co-owners of

the land to be partitioned. Therefore, 8th and 9th defendants are to become

entitle to the entire land they must prove that the other co-owners were

ousted by an overt act and they had been in adverse and uninterrupted

possession for more than 10 years. 8th and 9th defendants failed to prove

that their mother had possessed the entire land against her daughters and

therefore also possessed the said land against the right of their half-

sisters.

Further, Laisa died in 1974 and thereafter the disputes

started among them and plaintiff instituted this action 1984. Therefore,

there was no adverse possession established by the 8th and 9th defendants

against the rights of the other co-owners of the land to be partitioned. !i I f

f

~ I

Therefore, it is clear that the learned trial Judge failed to

consider the concept of ouster of co-owners by the 8th and 9th defendants

who are also co-owners. In these sense, that the plaintiff and all other

defendants are entitled to their shares in the land to be partitioned.

And also it is important to consider whether the learned

J

District Judge came to the conclusion that the Mancho and Ranso do not

inherits to the property of the father after they have been married in Deega

(Judgment at page 178)

7

A daughter under the Kandyan Law inherits the father's

property only in certain circumstances. They are;

1) if the daughter is married in Binna or

2) if the daughter is married after the father's death. (Section 12 (1)

Kandyan Law Ordinance No.39 of 1938)

In the case of HewayaZage Gunasinghe vs. HewaZayage

Laisa (1988) 2 CALR 23 stated that -

"getting married in diga and leaving the ancestral home after

her father's death would not bring about forfeiture of whatever

rights the daughter acquired from her father on his death as

these rights would have already crystallised."

Therefore, it is clear that the Mancho and Ranso married in

Deega does not forfeiture of any rights of their father's property as they

were married after their father's death.

This Court is of the opinion that the learned trial Judge in

considering the prescriptive title of the 8th and 9 th defendants had not

taken into consideration the substantive law of prescription and the

inheritance under the Kandyan Law Ordinance No. 39 of 1938. Further,

we note that the observations and the decisions of the learned District

Judge are contradictory as contained in the impugned judgment. This is

reflected in page 167 of the judgment. Furthermore, it is to be noted that

8

f I ! i

the Judge had himself noted that the demeanor of the 8th defendant and

had made a special note in page 180. The District Judge had the great

advantage of seeing the witnesses. Furthermore, on a questions of fact

appellate court will not overrule decisions of lower courts unless it is a

perverse order, 20 NLR 332, 1993 1 SLR 119. But taking into

consideration the observations of the trial judge this Court is of the opinion

that the 8th defendant had not been a convincing witness as observed by

the Judge at page 180. In the circumstances, taking into consideration

the cumulative facts, the law and its applicability to the issues raised in

this case we are not in apposition to hold with the Judgment of the learned

District Judge. Therefore, on the merits of this case the plaintiff-appellant

is entitled to relief as prayed for in his plaint.

Appeal allowed.
