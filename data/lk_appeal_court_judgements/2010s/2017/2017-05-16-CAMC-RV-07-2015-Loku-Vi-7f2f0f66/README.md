Learned Counsel for the petitioner Mr.Thiranagama is not present before this

Court today. Learned Deputy Solicitor General Mrs. Varunika Hettige

represents the Hon. Attorney General. As observed by this Court the accused

Loku Vithanage Rathnapala had faced three charges before the Magistrate

Court of Morawaka in the year 1988, but that the said case records are not

before Court and what is before Court is only the comitials with regard to the

said cases maintained at the Matara Prison. Out of the three cases the first

case 31554 refers to four charges but it is not clear the 3rd and 4th charges to

us. However, we observed that the Magistrate had imposed a jail term of 12

years for the 4th charge but considering the Provisions of Criminal Procedure

Code we observe that the maximum the Magistrate could impose is two years if

the charges are under the Penal Code.

When going through the column three of the comital we observe that it refers to

charges of causing simple hurt and robbery of a repeater gun. In the said

circumstances we observe that the maximum period Magistrate can Impose

even for a charge of robbery under Penal Code would be 2 years. In the said

circumstances we impose a sentence of one year each to the first three counts

and for a period of two years to 4th count and a total period of five years

rigorous imprisonment to operative from August 1988.

With regard to the 2nd case MC Morawaka Case No. 28798, we observe that the

Magistrate had imposed total term of 34 years and 6 months. As observed by

us the accused had been charged on two counts for unlawful assembly and

another two counts of criminal trespass and robbery and two counts of

retention of stolen property. As observed by us charges of retention of stolen

property can only be maintained as an alternative charge. Therefore no

sentence can be imposed for the said two counts. We therefore make order

1'1\9~ V imposing a sentence of 6!rigorous imprisonment on the 1 st two counts and two

years each for the 3rd and 4th counts total into a jail term of five years rigorous

imprisonment. The said sentence also will have to be operative from the 2nd

September 1988.

In the 3rd charge sheet refers to case No. 28069. The accused had faced five

charges for unlawful assembly, robbery and retention of stolen property. As

observed by us the Magistrate had imposed a jail term of 18 years for the 3rd

count 5 years rigorous imprisonment on count two and 8 years rigorous

imprisonment for count 4, 3 years rigorous imprisonment for 5th count, which

2

appears to be illegal sentences imposed by the Magistrate. Considering the

above sentences we make the following order. On the 1 st charge period of 6

months rigorous imprisonment, 2nd, 3rd, 4th charges period of two years

ngorous imprisonment for each. 5th being a charge of retention of stolen

property we are not going to impose any sentence since that should be an

alternative count. Therefore the total period of sentence imposed on this charge

sheet will be six years and six months to operate from September 1988.

We direct the Registrar to communicate the sentence imposed on the accused

Loku Vithanage Rathnapala Prisoner No. P 7834- Mahara Prison forthwith.

Revision application is allowed.
