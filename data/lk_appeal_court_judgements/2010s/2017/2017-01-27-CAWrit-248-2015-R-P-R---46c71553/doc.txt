Rev. Makola Mangala Thero of Sri Sudarshanarama Purana Viharaya, Kiribathgoda and two others

have come before this court as Intervenient Petitioners to intervene in the present application. When

the matter was fixed for inquiry in to the intervention, parties agreed to dispose the question of

intervention on written submissions.

Petitioner to the present application Makavitage Gerard Perera had complained of a Land Acquisition

took place pursuant to public notices dated 20.02.1999 and 28.01.2000 for a Public Purpose of

Constructing a Bus Terminus and not making use of the said land for the public purpose to which it

was acquired. In support of his position the Petitioner has submitted before this court a document

produced marked P-9 a letter sent by Director (lands) R.D.A to the Divisional Secretary, Kelaniya

dated 31.07.2008.

The Petitioner had made several attempts to obtain a long lease to the said land since he had already

received compensation to the land so acquired. Even though he had received some favourable replies

from the authorities, he had later received some information that the said land has been earmarked for

3

another project and therefore he had come before this court against the said decision making those

who were responsible as Respondents to the present application.

Whilst the application filed by the Petitioner is pending before this court for objections by the

Respondents including the 6th and the i h Respondents Special Commissioner and the Kelaniya

Pradeshiya Sabawa, the three Intervenient Petitioners, the chief incumbent, the President of Dayaka

Sabawa and the Secretary of the Dayaka Sabawa of Sudarshanarama Purana Viharaya Kiribathgoda

had come before this court seeking intervention to the present application.

In the papers filed before this court the Intervenient Petitioners have submitted that there is a

resolution adopted by the Kelaniya Pradeshiya Saba to divest the subject matter to the present

application for the purpose of town development in the Kiribathgoda town including the construction

of a Multipurpose Building with a Public Library Complex.

As submitted by the Petitioners, the decision to include the Public Library Complex to the proposed

Multipurpose Building was a result of the representations made by the Petitioners with the Pradeshiya

Saba and therefore submitted that the Intervenient Petitioners have an interest in the application before

this court.

In this regard this court is mindful of the fact that the Pradeshiya Saba Kelaniya and its Secretary are

parties to the present application as 6th and i h Respondents and the said Respondents are yet to file

objections before this court.

This court, in several occasions had considered the question of intervention when parties sought

intervention and intervention was allowed in limited circumstances when the parties establish that the

said party was a necessary party for the court to reach the correct conclusion in those instances.

However this position was considered before a divisional branch of this court in the case of

Weerakoon and another V. Bandaragama Pradeshiya Saba (CA Writ 580/2007) 2012 BLR 310 and

4

Ranjith Silva J after considering several decisions of this court including Harold Peter Fernando V.

The Divisional Secretary Hanguranketha and two others 2005 BLR 120 and Tyre House (Pvt)

Limited V. Director General Customs CA application 730/95 CA minute dated 05.06.1996, held that

intervention cannot be allowed in writ applications in the absence of specific rules formulated by the

Supreme Court providing for the procedure permitting third parties to intervene in writ applications.

This court in the case of Dilmi Kasundara Malshani Suriyarachchi V. Sri Lanka Medical Council

and Others CA 187/ 2016 CA minute dated 05.10.2016 decided to follow the decision of the

Divisional Bench and therefore refused intervention by several parties who sought intervention in the

said case.

When considering the merits of the applications by the intervenient parties, other than the fact that the

intervenient parties have an interest in this matter, the parties failed to establish that they are a

necessary party to the applications. A~ we further observe, the parties necessary for the application, as

submitted by the Intervenient Petitioners themselves, i.e. the Secretary and the Kelaniya Pradeshiya

Sabawa have been made as Respondents to the present application as 6th and i h Respondents. In the

said circumstances this court sees no merit in the application of the Intervenient Petitioners.

For the foregoing reasons we decide to refuse the application for intervention made by the Intervenient

Petitioners

Application for intervention is refused.
