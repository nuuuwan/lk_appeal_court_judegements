This is an action fued by the Plaintiff-Appellant filed

against the Defendant-Respondents pleaded in her plaint and

2

subsequently amended plaint that the 18t Defendant namely

M.Gunasekera had encroached onto the land of the Plaintiff by

South and the 2nd Defendant had encroached the land of the

plaintiffs land by North.

In original Court the Plaintiff pleaded a declaration of title

for both blocks of land Lots 1 and 3. Defendant had fIled

answer and pleaded that the 18t Defendant is in possession of

the southern part by leave and license of one Sirisoriya and

Dissanayake who had brought the rights of the children of

Sethi the Defendant pleaded that he 1S a licensee of

Sirisoma where Sirisoma had brought from children of

Sethi had inherited rights of Sedara. Sedara was granted Lot

No.5 of plan No. 1176 dated 19.02.1955 made by J. Aluvihare

LS which is the fInal plan in D.C. Kegalle Partition action

8890jP a commission had been issued in this case and plan

No. K 2649 had been submitted by M.B. Ranathunga License

Surveyor dated 28.11.1989 (page 303-271) of the appeal brief.

This disputed lots in the said plan are Lots 1 and 3 .

The allegation of the plaintiff is that lot 1 is unlawfully

possessed by the 2nd Defendant and lot 3 is possessed by the

18t Defendant as per the fInal decree of the partition action

above mentioned lot 1 of plan No. K2649 which is lot 2 of plan

No.1176 was granted to Sethi who had been the 1 st defendant

in the partition action. Lot 3 of plan No.k2649 namely lot 5 of

plan No.1176 was granted to Sedara which later devolved on

his only daughter Sethi. The contention of the Defendant-

Respondent is that the plaintiff cannot claim any rights or title

as the rights have come to the parties by way of a partition

decree. A right in rem.

The contention of the plaintiff is that the 2 defendants

entered forcibly and dispossessed her in mid - 1986.1t is also

o bserved that the owners Sirisooriya Dissanayake and

Sirisoma had not litigated their rights in this case in point.

This is a requirement under Section 18 of the Civil Procedure

code, it is the position of the Plaintiff- Appellant that from the

time of the final decree in D.C. Case 8890 entered in 1955 the

Plaintiff and her husband and family members had possessed

the disputed lands till 1986 and have acquired prescriptive

rights to the said lands against all others. It is to be noted a

prescriptive rights cannot be claimed secretly. One has to

come within the main ingredients of prescription enshrined in

the Prescription Ordinance in order to legally become entitled

to as Prescription owners.

It is also further contended by the Plaintiff-Appellant

that the learned District Judge had failed to comply with

Section 1870f the Civil Procedure Code to answer all the issue,

as he had not answered issues No.lS and 16. As regards to

the framing of issues there is a series of judgment which spells

out that District Judge is bound to answer all the issues and

these answers has to be precise and comprehensive. This

obligation is enumerated in section 187 of the Civil Procedure

Code.

This has been reiterated in Mutukumarasinghe V.

Gomez 1994 (3) SLR 101 in the case of Mckinnon

Mackenzie V. Grindlays Bank Ltd.1986 (2) SLR 272

observed thus,

"The Privy Council has stressed that the case must be

tried upon the issues on which the right decision of the case

appears to the Court to depend"

Taking into consideration the above submission leaving

aside all the other submissions there is a fatal error on the

part of the learned District Jude for not answering issues

No.lS and 16. Therefore the judgment delivered in favor of the

Defendants cannot stand as the statutory provisions had not

5

\

been correctly followed. Therefore the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge delivered on 18.1.1999 is set aside

and Plaintiff-Appellant's appeal is allowed.

I agree.
