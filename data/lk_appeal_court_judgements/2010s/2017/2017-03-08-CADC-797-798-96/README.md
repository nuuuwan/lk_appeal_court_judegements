seeking to partition the land called"Minihompolwatta"alias

"Owita". The learned District Judge of Ratnapura has

delivered his judgment on 23/07 / 1996 confirming the

commissioner's scheme of partition plan No.3507 prepared by

Mr. M.Samarasekera Licensed Surveyor morefully described

in the schedule to the plaint among the parties in terms of the

provisions of the Partition Act (as amended ).Being aggrieved

by the said judgment the 8th defendant-appellant preferred

this appeal to this Court.

The trial commenced in this case on 16/ 12/ 1991,

no points of contest were raised. The 18t plaintiff has given

evidence when the case was proceed to trial and none of the

parties have not contested the evidence of the 18t plaintiff. The

main contention of these respondents is to get the 2nd

alternative plan dated 04.02.1996 prepared by Boopadeera

Licensed Surveyor, should be considered as it is going to

cause grave injustice to these respondents. The submissions

made by these respondent is a submission opposing the

Boopadeera's plan and contended that these Respondent are

prepared to accept either surveyor Boopadeera's first

alternative plan dated 01.08.1995 or proposed fmal scheme

No.3507 suggested by Samarasekera Licensed Surveyor. As

acceptance of those plans will minimize the damages that can

because to the parties in the event of accepting surveyor

Boopadeera's 2nd alternative plan dated 04.02.1996.

The counsel for the 1st and 12(a) 12(b) defendant -

respondents submitted that the said order had been made

before the amended Act No.17 of 1997 came into effect and

therefore appellants do not need to prefer this appeal with the

leave of this Court first and accordingly, it is clear that this

Court has jurisdiction to entertain this final appeal without

leave being obtained. He further stated that the learned

District Judge was corrected in rejecting the objections of the

defendants that the appellant have failed to adduce any

strong reasons so as to substantiate the fmal scheme of

partition plan 3507 is unjustifiable and unreasonable other

than the reasons which are trivial in nature suggested by

them in their objections taken in their respective written

submissions filed in the District Court.

Counsel for the respondents cited that the legal

principle has been accepted In the case of Albert Vs.

Ratnayake reported in 1988 (2) S.L.R. at page 246-249

His Lordship Justice Wijetunga held in this case that court

can consider in an appropriate case a scheme of partition

with substantial changes could be adopted and further held

that in this case that when there is slight alteration in a

scheme of partition suggested by a party to a partition action

when he objects to the fmal scheme of partition should not be

modify or change it. Further in the case of Appuhamy

Vs. Weerathunga 46 NLR 46 and Gunasekara Vs.

Soothannona 1988 (2) SLR 8 it was held that the

commissioners original scheme of partition should not be

lightly rejected.

We observed that the learned District Judge has

carefully analyzed the above circumstances and followed with

the above applicable law and arrived at the correct conclusion

that the fmal scheme of partition submitted by the court

commission is more fair and reasonable and practical when

compared with the two alternative scheme of partition.

The learned District Judge has assigned reasons in his

judgment in rejecting the above plaintiffs' objections is

perfectly correct in line with the aforesaid accepted principles

of law:

" ~ ~CD mI o~~ O@>m CD6 omm ~~ ~m ~

~ ~ ~ ~m ~ ~m ;~m b 65~ ml.m.

~. mlm &:s mtI re8 mtI ~ICD ~@) CDG om)G)tCD. "

Hence it is abundantly to clear that the above

objections which plaintiffs raised against it cannot be

supported in law and nowhere in their written submissions

flied in Court to point out a single instance where the

commissioner has failed to exercise his discretion judicially

by disregarding the said applicable law.

For the above reasons we see no reasons to interfere

with the order of the learned District Judge confirming the

7

commissioner's scheme of partition plan N.3507 and its

report is justifiable in law and hence the order of the learned

District Judge dated 23.07.1996 is hereby stands and the

appeals are dismissed without costs.
