M.M.A.Gaffoor, J.

The Defendant-Appellants (4th and i h Defendants) had preferred the instant

appeal and impugned the judgment delivered by the Learned District Judge dated

28.09.1999 in the District Court of Galle.

By the aforesaid judgment the shares of the co-owned land has been allocated

only to the Plaintiff who became entitled to 10/32 share and the 1 st Defendant

became entitled to 6/32 share, while 1/32 share was left unallotted.

In the said context the aforesaid Defendant-Appellant had moved for an

exclusion of Lots D and E morefully depicted in the preliminary plan marked as X

bearing No. 620 made by G.H.G.A.A. de Silva Licensed Surveyor.

The plaintiff instituted a Partition action to partition the co-owned land

more fully depicted in the aforesaid plan containing in extent two and half acres

known as Pinnaketiyawatta and Godaehalawatta contiguous lands to be divided

between the Plaintiff and the 1 st Defendant.

To buttress the above position the Plaintiff tendered number of deeds which

are marked as PI to P5. It is noted that as per plan No.620 Lots and are marked as

3

A,B,C,D,.E and out of the said Lots the Defendant-Appellants are claiming lot D and

E as those lots are portions of a larger land known as Welikandawatte lot 1 and lot 2

accordingly.

The only contentious issue in this appeal to be resolved is whether the

Defendant-Appellants had proved that the Lots D and E are portions of a different

land as they claimed to be. Therefore in the appellate review it is incumbent on this

court to consider whether the Defendant-Appellants had proved the fact that the land

claimed to be is in existence or not. It is pertinent to note that the land sought to be

partitioned and the devolution of title is different from the land claimed to be

excluded by the Defendant-Appellants.

It is pertinent to note that although the Defendant-Appellants had stated a

different pedigree and the devolution of title the predecessor in title to fully differ

from the Plaintiff s chain of title.

It has been observed by the Learned District Judge that the Lot D which is a

larger portion of the land to be partitioned, an which has been claimed by the 4th

4

Defendant-Appellant, has failed to give evidence at the trial to prove his case, but

some deeds had been tendered by the 5th Defendant-Appellant who claims a very

minute portion from the land sought to be partitioned.

Further it is salient to be mentioned that the Defendant-Appellants had failed

to tender any document to prove that the land they are claiming is registered at the

land Registry, and exists as a separate land. Besides the Defendant-Appellants had

failed to effect a superimposition of a plan which depicts the land they are claiming

and the lot D is a portion of the said land. In the absence of the said proof will not

establish of the stance of the Defendant-Appellants.

On the contrary it is apparent and the learned District Judge had taken

cognizance of the fact that the plaintiff has proved the existence of the land sought to

be partitioned, its extent and its meets and bounds by tendering the relevant folios in

respect of the land in suit.

It was the position of the Plaintiff that the corpus sought to be partitioned

consists of two contagious lands namely Godaehalawatta and Pinnaketiyawatta,

had been possessed as a co-owned land.

5

The position of the plaintiff had been that the plantation had been effected by

his father and after his death the plaintiff has been in possession of the plantation.

The learned District Judge in considering the argument set forth by the

defendant-appellants regarding the existence of fence consists of masonry stones

purported to be a demarcation of the two allotments of lands, had observed that the

said position was not put to the plaintiff in the course of the cross-examination.

It is salient to note that although the 5th Defendant has given evidence at the

trial in the District Court has categorically stated that he has no knowledge as to the

land in issue, but nevertheless he claims the lot E as a portion of a different land.

Surprisingly the 4th Defendant-Appellant has entrusted the 5th Defendant to prove his

case by tendering some deeds pertaining to a different land in the said context the

learned District Judge had rejected the argument of the Defendant-appellants that

lot D is a portion of a larger land.

6

Further it has been also observed by the learned District Judge that there has

not been a separate claim by the 5th defendant for the exclusion of lot E as such it

was held that the Defendant-Appellants has failed to prove that they are co-owners

of the land sought to be partitioned and more so that they had possession to the

same.

For the reasons stated above the learned District Judge was of the view that

it was only the plaintiff has proved possession and therefore the plaintiff should

be entitled to the plantation as claimed by him before the surveyor.

It is also contended by the Defendant-Appellants, that although it is

incumbent and the duty is cast upon the Trial Judge to investigate the title of the

parties, the learned Trial Judge had failed to do so , and thereby had arrived at a

erroneous decision.

It is intensely relevant to note that the Defendant-Appellants are claiming an

exclusion of lot D from the corpus as it forms a part of a different land. It is being

observed by this Court that the learned District Judge has analyzed the facts placed

by the Defendant-Appellants and arrived at the irresistible conclusion that the said

Lot D is a part of the corpus and had rejected the Defendant-Appellants position

7 l

that said Lot D is a portion of a different land as there was no iota of evidence to

prove the same.

Hence for the reasons as stated above this Court is of the view that there is

no merits in the argument put forward by the Defendant-Appellant.

In considering the evidence surfaced in the above case the Learned District Judge

arrived at the above determination in the correct perspective which needs no

variation in the appellate review

Hence the appeal stands dismissed.

Appeal dismissed.
