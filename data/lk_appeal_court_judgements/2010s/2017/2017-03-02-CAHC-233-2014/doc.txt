CASE-NO- CA- 233 / 2013 - JUDGMENT- 23.02.2017

P.R. Walgama, J

In the instant appeal the Accused - Appellant has

called In question the legal acceptability of the

judgment passed by the Learned High Court Judge

dated 16.10.2014, by which judgment the Accused-

Appellant (1 st accused) and the 2nd accused who was

tried in absentia was sentenced to death.

The Accused - Appellant and his brother the 2nd

accused arraigned for having committed murder of

one Upali Hemantha on 06.12.1998.

the instant appeal is stated hereunder;

The alleged incident of murder took place and the

deceased came about his death and the scuffle

ensued in the boutique of one Senaviratne. As per

testimony of the said witness the Accused - Appellant

came with his brother the 2nd Accused to his

boutique and stabbed the deceased who was seated

stab InJunes the deceased ran away, but had fallen

closer to the said boutique. Further it was his

verSlOn that before the said stabbing took place there

had not been any exchange of words or threats by

the deceased for the Accused - Appellant to be

provoked. It IS the unequivocal position of the

prosecution that the evidence deducible does not gIve

the Accused - Appellant to come under the Exception

(4) of Section 294 the Penal Code, which states thus;

"culpable homicide IS not murder if it IS committed

without premeditation In a sudden fight In the heat

of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the

offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a

cruel or unusual manner".

The witness Shantha Pushapakumara did depose In

the similar lines. The above witness was having meals

with the deceased when the Accused - Appellant

attacked him with a knife. Thereafter the 2nd accused

had stabbed the deceased in the posterior, and it was

his verSlOn that the deceased did not get in to a

scuffle with the Accused - Appellant.

Therefore the evidence that transpired

does not reveal any scuffle before the

The deceased had suffered five 1nJunes out of which

the 1nJury No. 1 and 3 have pierced the lung while

the 4th 1nJury has gone to the chest cavity and the

5th 1nJury has pierced the kidney. Further it was

categorically stated that 1nJury Nos. 1,3 and 5 are

Per contra, the Learned Counsel for the Accused -

Appellant has urged In confutation that the Learned

High Court Judge has failed to consider the

extenuating circumstances that the Accused - Appellant

could be convicted for lesser culpability. Nevertheless it

IS salient to note that the evidence transpired In the

court below does not expose the accused for a

lesser culpability, viz culpable homicide not amounting

to murder.

Further the Learned Counsel for the Accused-

Appellant had adverted court to legal authority VIZ.

THE KING VS. BELLANA VITHANAGE EDDIN - 41 NLR-

345 which held thus;

"in a charge of murder it IS the duty of the judge

to put to the JUry the alternative of finding the

accused IS guilty of culpable homicide not amounting

to murder when there IS any basis for such a

finding In the evidence on record, although such

defence was not raised nor relied upon by the

accused".

Taking the rationale of the above stated principle it

IS axiomatic to note that the testimony of the

witnesses were such it does not establish the fact

that the ground situation did culminate to a sudden

fight, or the Accused - Appellant's act was due to

sudden provocation.

Hence In the wake of the above legal and factual

matrix, I am of the view that there IS no substantial

and compelling circumstances justifying a lesser

sentence.

Thus we accordingly uphold the finding of guilt as

against as recorded by the court below and also the

sentence imposed in respect of the offence committed

by him.

Consequently the appeal IS dismissed.
