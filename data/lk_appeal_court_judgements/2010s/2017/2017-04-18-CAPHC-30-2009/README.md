The Petitioner Respondent Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

called and referred to as the Respondent) filed information under section

66(1 )(b) of the Primary Court Procedure Act, as a private plaint in the

Magistrate Court of Mawanella, informing Court that a land dispute has

arisen and the breach of the peace is threatened or likely. The Respondent

stated to Court that he was in possession of the land described in the

schedule to the plaint from 1992 on the strength of the ownership obtained

by the deed marked as Pe 1. The Respondent Petitioner Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Appellant) has filed an

action in the District Court to partition the land described in the schedule to

the plaint, was dismissed. On the date that the judgment was pronounced in

the said partition action, the Appellant disturbed the possession of the

Respondent by plucking coconut and destroying the vegetation cultivated

3

by the Respondent. The Respondent and his daughter have made two

complaints to the police. The Respondent instituted this action seeking an

order preventing the Appellant from disturbing his possession.

The Appellant admitted the partition action and denied the rest. He

claimed the ownership to the land on a different pedigree and described the

land in dispute differently. His contention is that though the partition

action was dismissed, the land was identified by the learned District Judge

as the land described by the Appellant. He further stated that he has not

disturbed the Respondent possessing any land owned by the Respondent

and moved to dismiss the application.

The learned Primary Court Judge, after completing the pleading and

the written submissions, delivered the determination holding that the

breach of the peace is threatened due to this land dispute and determined

that the possession of the Respondent shall not be disturbed by the

Appellant until the rights of the parties are determined by a competent civil

court.

Being aggrieved, the Appellant moved in revision in the High Court

of Kegalla without success. This appeal is from the said order of the High

Court.

In an action filed under section 66( 1 )(b) of the Primary Court

Procedure Act, the Primary Court Judge has to be satisfied that the breach

of the peace is threatened or likely. In the present case the learned

Magistrate has considered the two complaints made by the Respondent and

the daughter regarding the incident. The Appellant contest the truthfulness

of the contents of the statements on the basis that the Respondent has failed

to tender any inquiry notes or details of charges filed against the Appellant

by the police on this statements. I believe that the Court has to be mindful

of the fact that the Respondent was not charged for making a false

4

statement to the police too. The application before the High Court being a

revision application and not being an appeal, the learned High Court Judge

need not consider the correctness of the conclusions of the Magistrate

based on facts. Revision is not to correct the errors committed by the lower

courts.

The learned Magistrate has identified the land described in the

schedule to the information as the disputed land. The learned District

Judge in the partition action has decided that the land which was to be

partitioned was the land described by the Appellant and not the land

described by the Respondent. In the present case the Respondent is

claiming that he is in possession of the land described by him and not the

land described by the Appellant. The Respondent's contention is that the

Appellant disturbed his possession of the land described by him. The

Appellant admits that he has no claim whatsoever to the Respondent's

land. In these circumstances it is clear that the Appellant did not possess

the land of the Respondent. The learned Primary Court Judge has correctly

decided that the land in dispute is in the possession of the Respondent.

I do not see any reason to interfere with the findings of the learned

Magistrate or the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly I dismiss the appeal subject to costs fixed at Rs.
