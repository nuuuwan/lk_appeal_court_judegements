JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for both the Parties, when this case came up on 2017-07-

07 before this Court, agreed to have this case ,disposed of, by way of

written submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral

submissions. They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment

after considering the written submissions they had already filled.

Therefore, this judgment would be based on the material adduced by

parties in their pleadings and the written submissions.

The Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Complainant - Respondent) had filed an information in

the Primary Court of Mawanella under section 66 (1) of the Primary Court

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 complaining to the learned Primary Court

Judge about a breach of peace between two parties over a dispute relating

to a roadway.

The two rival parties named in the said information were the 1st

Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called and

referred to as the Appellant) and the 2nd Respondent - Respondent-

Respondent (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the

Respondent) .

Learned Magistrate having inquired into this complaint, had held by his

order dated 2008-02-27, that the Appellant had failed to establish that he

is entitled to a right of way over the land possessed by the Respondent.

Learned Magistrate, had refused the Appellant's stance that he is entitled,

to the impugned right of way.

Being aggrieved by the .said order of the learned Primary Court Judge, the

Appellant had made a revision application to the Provincial High Court of

5

Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle urging the Provincial High Court

to revise the order made by the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, by its judgment dated

2010-07-28, had refused the said application for revision and had

proceeded to dismiss it with costs affirming the order of the learned

Primary Court Judge.

It is that judgment which the Appellant seeks to canvass in this appeal

before this Court.

It is the observation of this Court that the major part of the written

submission filed on behalf of the Appellant contains the sequence of events

which led this case to reach this court.

The submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant as to

why he should have been granted a right of way, are contained in

paragraph 15 of his written submissions. However perusal of those

. . '

arguments show that they are mere statements to the effect;

i. that the learned Provincial High Court judge has erred and/ or

misdirected himself when he held that the Appellant has not received

6

the impugned right of way from the deed of transfer No 9199 dated

14th September 2007 attested by M. F. Hussain Notary Public.

ii. that the learned Provincial High Court judge has erred and/ or

misdirected himself when he held that the Appellant has failed to

produce documents sufficient to establish that he is a long time user

of the impugned right of way.

iii. that the learned Provincial High Court judge has erred and/ or

misdirected himself when he had decided to disregard the affidavit

submitted by some other users who had claimed to have used the

impugned roadway.

iv. that the learned Provincial High Court judge has erred and/ or

misdirected himself when he had failed to appreciate the land locked

nature of the Appellant's land.

v. that the learned Provincial High Court judge has erred and/ or

misdirected himself when he had failed to address his mind to the

observation notes of the Police.

However it is to be noted that the learned counsel for the Appellant has

not attempted to show to the satisfaction of this court that the above

statements are right and could be supported by evidence.

7

Although it is the position of the Appellant that the deed of transfer No.

9199 has granted the impugned right of way to the Appellant, the

Appellant has failed to refer to the particular place of the said deed he

relies upon. This is necessary particularly because there is a specific finding

by the learned Primary Court Judge that no such right has been granted to

the Appellant by the said deed.

This court in the case of CA (PHC) 147/20091 has stated the restricted

nature of the scope of this type of Appeals in this court as well as that in

the Provincial High Courts.

It would be relevant to bear in mind that the appeal before this Court is an

appeal against a judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court in

exercising its revisionary jurisdiction. Thus, the task before this Court is not

to consider an appeal against the Primary Court order but to consider an

appeal in which an order pronounced by the Provincial High Court in the

exercise of its revisionary jurisdiction is sought be impugned.

This court observes that both the judgement of the learned Primary Court

Judge and that of the learned Provincial High Court Judge do not show any

1 Decided on 2017-09-27

8

illegality or impropriety. There is also no any irregularity of proceedings

before both courts. Thus, it is the view of this court that there had been no

ground before the Provincial High Court which would have warranted its

intervention in this case using its discretionary revisionary powers.

In addition, Perusal of the judgment of the learned Primary Court Judge

shows to the satisfaction of this Court that he has substantially dealt with

all the points relevant to this case. This Court does not think that it should

re consider them again one by one.

On the other hand, the Appellant has not adduced any basis for such a

course of action. For the above reasons, this Court is of the opinion that it

does not have any basis to interfere with the judgement of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge who had decided to refuse the said revision

application.

It would also be relevant to state here that the Supreme Court in the case .. . of Ramalingam V Thangarajah2 which interpreted section 69 (1) has held

that the word "entitle" in that section connotes the ownership of the

relevant right.

2 1982 (2) Sri. L R 693.

9 t

It is the view of this Court also that the Appellants have failed to prove to

the satisfaction of Court that they are entitled to the impugned roadway.

Further, as has been done by this court in other judgements of this nature

it would be relevant to reproduce the following passage from a judgment

of this Court in the case of Punchi Nona V Padumasena and othersJ.

" The jurisdiction conferred on a primary Court under section 66 is a

special jurisdiction. It is a quasi-criminal jurisdiction. The primary object of

the jurisdiction so conferred is the prevention of a breach of the peace

arising in respect of a dispute affecting land. The Court in exercising this

jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation into title or the right to

possession which is the function of a civil Court. He is required to take

action of a preventive and provisional nature pending final adjudication of

rights in a civil Court ... "

Thus, it is the view of this Court that there had been no basis for the

Provincial High Court to interfere with the conclusion of the learned

Primary Court Judge as there are ample reasons to satisfy itself with its

31994 (2) Sri. l R 117.

I I1i II( f Il

10

legality and propriety as required by section 364 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979.

Considering all the above material, this Court sees no merit in this appeal.

Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal. Further, this Court

makes order that the Respondents are entitled to costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
