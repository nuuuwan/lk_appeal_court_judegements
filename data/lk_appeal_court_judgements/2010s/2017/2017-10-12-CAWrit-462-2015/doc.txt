VI. that the Petitioner's registered address was at No. 394, Second Floor,

Pannipitiya Road, Pelawatte, Battaramulla and thereafter the

registered office was shifted to 108/ A, 1/1, Maya Avenue, Colombo

610.

It is the Petitioner's position that the 3rd Respondent had not made any

attempt to serve notices at the registered office of the Petitioner to inform

him about the inquiries conducted by him regarding the said payment of

gratuity.

Thus the Petitioner complains that the above lapse resulted in an ex parte

inquiry being conducted against him, by the 3rd Respondent.

It is on the above grounds that the petitioner in this application has prayed

for a writ of Certiorari to quash the order/award of the 1st Respondent, set

out in the certificate filed in the Magistrate's Court produced marked P 3. It

is the position of the Petitioner that the said orders/awards are ultra'vires,

illegal and hence null and void due to the breach of rules of natural justice.

10 Paragraph 20 (ii) of the petition.

9

The Petitioner therefore has pleaded that it be quashed on the basis of that

alleged error on the face of its recordll ,

The above material show that the issue to be principally addressed by this

Court is whether the 1st _3rd Respondents has breached the principles of

rules of natural justice by not affording an opportunity for the Petitioner to

participate at the said inquiry,

In order to address this issue it is necessary to consider the respective

positions taken up by the parties with regard to the sending of notices.

The position with regard.to that, taken up by the Petitioner would be as

follows.

1. Although the said certificate and the journal entry contained the

Petitioner's address as No. 52/1, Baddegana South, Pitakotte, the

Petitioner never received any such notice with regard to the said

inquiry conducted by the Department of Labour relating to the

payment of gratuity to 4th - 10th Respondents12

II. The Petitioner's registered address was at No. 394, Second floor,

Pannipitiya Road, Pelawatte, Battaramulla and thereafter the

11 Paragraph 21 of the petition.

12 Paragraph 20 (i) of the petition.

10

registered office was shifted to 108/ A, 1/1, Maya Avenue, Colombo

., 0613.i

III. The 3rd Respondent had not attempted to serve notices at the

registered office of the petitioner14

IV. Two of the directors of the petitioner company are also directors of a

company called North Western Apparels (Pvt) Ltd. Who presently

operate from premises No. 52/1, 8addegana South, Pitakotte15

V. The petitioner never operated at the said address No. 52/1,

8addegana South, Pitakotte16

The positions taken up by the 1st -3rd Respondents in this regard however

are different. The following positions namely,

1. that the petitioner was notified to attend an inquiry by letters dated

2009-07-31 and 2009-08-14 produced marked 1 R 2 (al and 1 R 2

QU.

13 Paragraph 20 (ii) of the petition.

14 Paragraph 20 (iii) of the petition.

15 Paragraph 20 (iv) of the petition.

16 Paragraph 20 (v) of the petition. --------------------'

L

11

II. that the petitioner defaulted attending the said inquiry and

consequently was informed of the findings of the inquiry by letters

dated 2010-03-02, 2012-02-08 and 2014-04-09 produced

respectively marked as 1 R 3 (a) , 1 R 3 (b) , 1 R 3 (e),

III. that the petitioner has categorically admitted the receipt of such-

letters by his letter dated 2012-07-26 produced marked 1 R 4.

IV. that the petitioner has right through acted and conducted himself

mala fide and with absolute disregard of law.

V. that the petitioner on being informed about a possible action being

taken in case he further defaults EPF payments had sought a period

of two months to settle the said EPF dues by his letter dated 2012-

07-13 produced marked 1 R 7,

are worthwhile being highlighted as they shed a considerable light on the

principle issue to be decided by this Court.

The two letters produced marked 1 R 2 (al and 1 R 2 (b) are the letters

by which' the 1st _3 rd Respondents claim to have notified the Petitioner to

attend the said inquiry. These letters are dated 2009-07-31 and 2009-08-

14 respectively and had both ' been addressed to 253!)@C)2:Sld' epC.,:H5)25')~,

12

cn@ecn, 2512:S)~76C)c.o. According to the lease agreement marked P 2

the leasing of the factory was effective from 2006-06-0117. Petitioner has

stated that he successfully operated the factory for 03 years until he was

forced to close it around 2009-06-2418. According to paragraph 13 of the

petition it was thereafter that Tri Star had taken over the factory and

commenced its operations. Thus the Petitioner has not proved to the

satisfaction of this Court that it's factory remained closed when the two

notices produced marked 1 R 2 Ca) and 1 R 2 (b) were sent by the lst-

3rd Respondents to inform the Petitioner about the impugned inquiry.

Indeed this Court has to note that the letter written by the Petitioner

produced marked 1 R 7 also contains its factory at the address of

. Magallegama, Nikaweratiya. This letter is dated 2012-0713. The reasonable

inference that this Court could draw from these facts is that the said

factory premises was not a premises which had been abandoned during

the relevant period.

, ...

The veracity of the other positions taken up by the Petitioner becomes

relevant for the decision regarding the truthfulness of his position that he

17 Clause 2.1 of P 2.

18 Paragraph 10 ~the petition,

.

13

did not receive the said notices. Thus this Court would now turn to two

other positions taken up by the Petitioner.

As has been mentioned above, it is the position of the Petitioner that he

never operated at the address No. 52/1, Baddegana South, Pitakotte .

It is interesting to note that the address that the petitioner has opted to

state in the caption of this application is No. 52/1, Baddegana South,

Pitakotte. It is the same address mentioned in the proxy signed by the

directors of the petitioner company. The question then arises as to why the

Petitioner had chosen to mention a place as his address for the purpose of

a Court case namely this application, when he himself claims that it is not

an address he ever operated from.

Although it is the petitioner's claim that it never operated from the said

address, it could be noted that the letter produced marked 1 R 4 also

bears the address No. 52/1, Baddegana South, Pitakotte. That is a letter

the petitioner has written to the 3rd Respondent on 2012-07-26. It is a

clear indication that the Petitioner operated from the said address.

It must be noted that the notices informing the Petitioner regarding EPF

contributions had also been sent by the 3rd Respondent. The said notices

14

produced marked 1 R 6 (b) and 1 R 6 (e) have been addressed to No.

52/1, Baddegana South, Pitakotte. These letters have been sent on 2012-

06-27 and 2012-09-05 respectively. This Court has to note that the

Petitioner had replied to the said notices by his letter addressed to the 3rd

Respondent marked 1 R 7, requesting more time to make the payment

referred to in those notices. This letter had been written by the Petitioner

on 2012-07-13. It is also interesting to note as has been mentioned before,

that the letterhead of that letter states the address of the factory of the

Petitioner as 'Magallegama, Nikaweratiya'.

In these circumstances the claim that the petitioner has never operated

from that address cannot be a truthful position.

Further the Petitioner has stated in his petition that there had been a

Korean Director in his company19. However the documents produced

G 0,

marked 1 R 1 (a) and 1 R 1 (b) shows that, that assertion is also not

true.

Therefore this court is compelled to hold that the Petitioner has not been

truthful in its assertions. It is the view of this Court that these false

assertions vitiate the truthfulness of the positions taken up by the

19 Paragraph 12 of the petition.

Petitioner. This would be a serious blow to the credibility of the Petitioner's

versions.

It would be appropriate to reproduce at this juncture the following extract

from a judgment of Jayasuriya J in the case of Blanca Diamonds (Pvt) Ltd.

Vs. Wilfred Van Els and two others20

II .... In filing the present application for discretionary relief in the Court of

Appeal Registry, the petitioner company was under a duty to disclose.

uberrima fides and disclose all material facts to this court for the purpose

of this court arriving at correct adjudication on the issues arising upon this

application. In the deciSion in Alphonso Appuhamy Vs. Hettiarachchi2\

Justice Pathirana, in an erudite judgment, considered the landmark

decisions on this province in English law and cited the decisions which laid

down the principle that when a party is seeking discretionary relief from

this Court upon an application for a writ of certiorari, he enters into a

contractual obligation with the Court when he files in the Regi~try and in

terms of that contractual obligation he is required to disciose uberrima

fides and disclose all material facts fully and frankly to this Court. 22 ... "~

Thus it is the view of this Court that the Petitioner is guilty of breach of

uberrima fides as he has failed to divulge the truth.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner has drawn the attention of this Court to

section 523 of the Companies Act No 07 of 2007 to argue that the way to

give notice to a company is the way that section has set out. The segment

in which section 523 is found in the Companies Act is the section dealing

with application and reference to court. Since the proceedings impugned in

this case is under the Termination qf Workmen (Special Provisions) Act it

should be the provisions of that Act which must prevail.

Section 18 of the Termination of Employment of Workman Act No. 45 of

1971 states that 'any notice which is required to be served on, or given

personally to, such person; be deemed to have been duly served or given

a) If it is left at the usual or last known place of abode or business of .

such person; or

b) If it is sent to him by post in a registered letter addressed to the

usual or last known place of abode or business of such person.

17

Therefore it is the view of this Court that the serving of notices in respect .. of any proceeding under the said Act must be governed by section 18 of

the Termination of Workmen (Special Provisions) Act.

For the foregoing reasons it is the view of this court that there is no merit

in this application and that the petitioner has not been truthful in its

positions. In these circumstances we deCide to dismiss this application with

costs.

Application dismissed with costs.
