The Plaintiff- Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff)

instituted action in the District Court of Ampara for inter alia a declaration that

the Plaintiff is the licence holder of the land morefully described in the Plaint

and further for an order ejecting the Defendant -Appellant (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Defendant) his servants and his agents from the

said land.

The Plaintiff in her Plaint dated 27.01.1995 stated that she was issued a permit

dated 28.09.l983 under the Land Development Ordinance in respect of the land

morefully described in the schedule to the Plaint and that the said land was

continuously cultivated by her brother and thereafter by her husband. The

Plaintiff contended that upon the demise of her father the possession of the

corpus was handed over to the Defendant for the limited cultivation of the said

land during the 1994 'yala' period. The Plaintiff stated that subsequently when

the Plaintiff resumed possession of the corpus the Defendant refused to allow

the Plaintiff to cultivate the said land and thereafter preferred a complaint

against the Plaintiff to the Police which resulted in Magistrate Court

proceedings bearing No. 56916 in the :Magistrates Court of Ampara against the

husband of the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff further states that the Magistrates Court

proceedings which were initiated under the provisions of the Primary Courts

Ordinance were concluded in favour of the Defendant and possession of the

corpus was vested in the Defendant. The Plaintiff in her Plaint reiterates the

position that the possession of the corpus was transferred to the Defendant only

for the limited purpose of cultivating the said land during the 'yala' period.

The Defendant filed answer in August 1995 and denied the contention of the

Plaintiff and insisted that the Defendant has been in undisturbed and

uninterrupted possession of the corpus for well over 20 years and that the

Plaintiff has never been in possession of same and further that the instant

dispute arose when a person named D. P. Akman forcibly tried to enter the

corpus which resulted in Magistrate Court proceedings which thereafter vested

the possession of the property with the Defendant. The Defendant further denied

that the Plaintiff has any licence issued in her name over the corpus and that she

has no entitlement to same. The Defendant in answer also claimed prescriptive

title over the corpus.

Trial commenced on 05.02.1996 and 4 issues were raised on behalf of the

Plaintiff and 3 issues were raised on behalf of the Defendant. The Plaintiff, the

Land Officer, the Plaintiff's grandmother gave evidence on behalf of the

Plaintiff and marked document Pl. The Defendant, one Amarakoon

Arachchilage Klirimudiyanse and one Sugathapala gave evidence on behalf of

the Defendant.

The learned District Judge of Ampara delivered judgment on 07.02.l999

declaring the Plaintiff to be the permit holder of the corpus and held that the

Defendant and his servants and agents were illegally in possession of same and

therefore awarded damages to the Plaintiff. Being aggrieved by the said

judgment the Defendant preferred the instant appeal.

The Plaintiff s claim is based on document marked as "P 1 " which is allegedly a

permit issued under the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance. The

said permit was issued to W. G. Sumanawathie (The Plaintiffs mother) and

thereafter the Plaintiff contends that the said W. G. Sumanawathie nominated

the Plaintiff as her successor and accordingly the Plaintiff became the permit

holder of the corpus upon the demise of her mother the said W. G.

Sumanawathie.

The Defendant contends the authenticity of the said document marked PI and

takes up the position that the same has been fabricated by the Plaintiff. The

Defendant further contends that the document marked as "P 1 " has not been duly

proved in trial.

In considering whether the said document "P 1" was duly proved attention is

drawn to page 49 of the appeal brief wherein the said document has been

marked as accepted evidence at the close of the case for the Plaintiff. The

Counsel for the Plaintiff relies on the case of Sri Lanka Ports Authority and

another V. Jugolinija-Boal East 1981(1) SLR 18 in which it was decreed that;

"if no objection is taken, when at the close of a case documents are read

in evidence, they are evidence for all purposes of the law. This is the

curses curiae of the original civil courts."

Similarly in the recent case of Samarakoon V. Gunasekera and another 2011 (1)

SLR 149 in which Amaratunga , J. held inter alia that;

/

5

"When a document is admitted subject to proof, the party tendering it in

evidence is obliged to formally prove it by calling the evidence necessary

to prove the document according to law. If such evidence is not called

and if no objection is taken to the document it is read in evidence at the

time of closing the case of the party who tendered the document it

becomes evidence in the case.

On the other hand if the document is objected to at the time when it is

read in evidence before closing the case of the party who tendered the

document in evidence, the document cannot be used as evidence for the

party tendering it."

Considering the above findings this Court finds that the document marked as

"P 1" has been duly proved at the trail since no objection was raised as to its

admissibility at the closing of the Plaintiff's case.

Having considered its admissibility, I shall now consider the effect of the said

document. The essence of the said document was corroborated by the Land

Officer who gave evidence that the Plaintiff became the permit holder upon the

demise of the original permit holder and that the said permit is still in force. The

Land Officer refers to a report dated 1 0.07.1997 which further substantiates the

Plaintiff's position. The Land Officer further states in evidence that to his

knowledge and as per the aforementioned report that the Plaintiff was in

possession of the corpus and that the Plaintiff was obstructed from cultivating

the said land.

The evidence of the Plaintiff's grandmother, who incidentally is also the mother

of the Defendant, is significant to determine the question of who possessed the

corpus. She states in evidence that the Plaintiff cultivated the corpus for four

years and that the possession of the corpus was transferred to the Defendant for

1 I l

I I

/

If /

the limited cultivation for only one season and that the Defendant failed to

revert possession to the Plaintiff. The narration the Plaintiffs grandmother

provides the context on which the instant dispute arose and this Court finds that

the credibility of the said witness has not been weakened by the Defendant by

cogent evidence and as such the learned District Judge has fittingly relied on her

evidence.

The learned Trial Judge by his impugned order has given additional weight and

reliance to the testimony of the said witness by considering the demeanour of

the said witness during trial.

The Counsel for the Plaintiff relies on the case of Alwis Vs. Piyasena Fernando

1993 (1) SLR 119 in which it was held that;

"The Court of Appeal should not have disturbed the findings of primary

facts made by the District Judge, based on credibility of witnesses."

In the case of De Silva & others Vs. Seneviratne & another 1981(2) SLR 7 it

was held that;

"Where the findings on questions of fact are based upon the credibility of

witnesses on the footing of the trial judge's perception of such evidence,

then such findings are entitled to great weight and the utmost

consideration and will be reversed only if it appears to the Appellate

Court that the trial judge has failed to make full use of his advantage of

seeing and listening to the witnesses and the Appellate Court is convinced

by the plainest considerations that it would be justified in doing so;"\

Considering the above precedent this Court finds that the learned Trial Judge

was correct in accepting the narration of evidence of the Plaintiff s grandmother

and was therefore correctly determined that the Plaintiff was in possession of

the corpus upon the demise of the mother and then thereafter that the dispute

\

arose when the Defendant failed to return possession of the corpus after the

same was handed over to the Defendant for the limited cultivation of the said

land during the 1994 'yala' period.

The learned Counsel for the Defendant prudently drew the attention of this

Court to the additional documents contained in the case record which have not

been marked as evidence but are found before and after the document marked as

P 1. It is clear that the learned District Judge has not relied on the said

documents but has solely relied on the strength ofP!. I see no reason to suppose

that that the learned Trial Judge has considered these additional documents in

concluding on his determination and therefore concur with the findings.

The learned Counsel for the Defendant contends the authenticity of document

marked as PI and submits that the said document is riddled with inconstancies.

The learned Counsel for the Defendant highlights the inconsistency between the

date which appears at the bottom of the said document PI i.e. 74.08.20 and the

Plaintiff s position that she was issued the permit in 1983 as per her Plaint. It is

further submitted that schedule 3 of the said document refers to the land being

half an acre and not one and a half acres as contended by the Plaintiff. I take the

view that the date which appears at the bottom of PI relates to a subsequent

entry made to item (2) of the 1st schedule of PI by an authorised officer who

identified the corpus as being one and a half acres and further described its

boundaries. It is pertinent to note that the said description and extent

corresponds with the schedule referred to in the Plaint. It is only after a

subsequent entry on document marked as PI that the Plaintiff claims title and

the said entry has been counter signed, sealed and dated 28.09.1983.

Although the Counsel for the Defendant relies on a certified copy of the order of

the learned Magistrate in case bearing No. 5696 purportedly marked as VI it

must be noted that the document marked as VI found in the case record is in

f,I

/

fact proceedings in case bearing No. A R 1342. Considering the heavy reliance

the Defendant places on the findings of Magistrates Court case bearing No.

5696 the onus was on the Defendant to produce same in trial especially where

the Defendant claims prescriptive title over the corpus. This Court finds that the

learned Trail Judge has correctly held that the Defendant has not proved

prescriptive title to the corpus in the absence of evidence of adverse possession

and in any event the question as to prescription does not arise on state land.

F or the reasons morefully described above the Appeal is dismissed without

costs and considering the lack of evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff to quantify

the damages suffered in this regard the award of damages is hereby rescinded.

Appeal dismissed.
