The substantive relief prayed for in prayer (b) to the Petition is to issue a

mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the decision to appoint the

3ih Respondent to the post of Senior Lecturer, Grade II by letter of appointment

marked P7. Document marked P7, as stated in paragraph 18 of the Petition is a

document which contains the qualification and work experience of four (4)

Candidates who had applied for the said post. Paragraph 16 of the Petition refers

to an unsigned copy of the letter of appointment of the 3 i h Respondent, marked

P6.

The prayer to the Petition refers to the said letter of appointment of the 37th

Respondent as P7. Therefore as it stands, relief prayed for in item (b) to the prayer

cannot be granted.

Since the said inadvertence amounts to a technical error, the Petitioner is

directed to amend the prayer accordingly, and support.
