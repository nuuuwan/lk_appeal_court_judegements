The suspect petitioner was remanded under Sec. 8 and 9 of the

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witness Act, No 4

of 2015 and was remanded by the Chief Magistrate of Colombo. He's

alleged to have threatened a witness.

In the instant case the suspect petitioner was ordered bail by the

Magistrate and remanded on another B report before he could furnish

bail. When suspects are produced before the Magistrate's Court under

the provisions of the said act the Magistrate is duty bound to see whether

the police have abused the provisions of the said Act.

Further the Magistrate should ascertain whether the facts placed

before him falls within sec. 81 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

where the provision is in place to bind over the parties produced before

him. After considering the facts placed before the Magistrate, if the

Magistrate is of the view that a particular suspect has violated the bail

conditions, he should proceed to cancel the bail order and remanded the

suspect. Such a suspect should not be remanded under the provisions of

Act No. 04 of 2015.

2

We decide to release the suspect petitioner on bail. The learned

Magistrate is ordered to release the suspect petitioner on Rs. 25,000/=

cash bail with two sureties acceptable to the Magistrate.
