JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Accused Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Accused) in this case was indicted by the Director General of the

Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption in the High

Court of Colombo under several counts.

Learned High Court Judge has commenced, conducted and concluded the

trial against the Accused, as he had pleaded not guilty to the charges when

the same was read over to him. At the end of the trial learned High Court

Judge by his judgment dated 2015-02-19 had acquitted the Accused from

all counts in the indictment.

The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption who is

the Complainant - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Petitioner) has made this application to this Court seeking to revise the said

judgment pronounced by the learned High Court Judge.

The submission made by the learned counsel for the Petitioner consisted of

three arguments. They are as follows.

i. That the learned High Court Judge had erred when she referred to a

portion from the statement of the prosecution Witness No. 01

Ravindra Lasantha Pathinayake in the judgment.

ii. That the contradiction! relied upon by the learned High Court Judge

with regard to signaling Inspector Gunawardhana2 by the decoy

Police Sergeant 24040 Wijesinghe,3 does not exist as a contradiction

according to the evidence.

iii. That the finding by the learned High Court Judge4 that a bribery

transaction of this nature occurred in the presence of another person

is improbable, is not reasonable and therefore should not be

permitted to stand.

Prosecution Witness No. 01 Ravindra Lasantha Pathinayake in the course of

his evidence categorically statedS that Police Sergeant 24040 Wijesinghe

who acted as the decoy called someone from his mobile phone. According

to him, it was immediately thereafter, that Inspector Gunawardhana6 had

arrived in that place by the vehicle of the Bribery Commission. Even during

the cross-examination,7 this witness had maintained the same position. It is

not his position that the method used by the decoy to communicate with

the Officer in Charge of this raid (IP Gunawardhana) was by way of

signaling.

On the other hand, the position taken up by prosecution witness No.2 PS

Wijesinghe who acted as the decoy is that he signaled I P Gunawardhana

waving his hand after the money was handed over to the accused. In the

course of the cross examination this witness had confirmed that he never

used his mobile phone to communicate to I P Gunawardhana about money

being handed over to the accused8.

In the light of the above evidence, this Court is not inclined to form a view

that the observation made by the learned High Court Judge was totally

unwarranted.

Prosecution Witness No. 01 Ravindra Lasantha Pathinayake in the course of

cross-examination has admitted having stated in his statement that he

informed the accused that a person from the company would come and

meet the accused9 It appears that the learned defence counsel was

prompted to confront this witness with his statement because he had taken

a different position in his evidence. In such a situation, once the witness

had admitted the confronted position with regard to a suggested

discrepancy, that becomes an admitted contradiction. Thus, a reference to

such a portion by the trial Judge cannot be faulted as that would be the

only way to refer to that kind of admitted contradiction.

Admittedly, prosecution witness No.2 PS Wijesinghe did not act as a

person introduced to the accused by the virtual complainant. PS Wijesinghe

had been observing the transactions between the virtual complainant and

the accused, pretending as if he was working in the office of the virtual

complainant. While this Court forms the view that it would not be

improbable for that kind of transaction to take place in the given set of

circumstances, this Court is not inclined to find fault with the observation

made by the learned High Court Judge with regard to the said improbability

9 Page 109 of the brief.

as it is in the light of all the other relevant material that the learned High

Court Judge had come to that conclusion. Thus, that must be treated as an

observation made in the light of the facts and circumstances of this case. It

would not be correct to extract and consider such observation in isolation

to decide its viability in general.

Prosecution must bear in mind that the burden to prove the charges

beyond reasonable doubt, would be fairly and squarely upon it. Until that is

done, the accused must be presumed to be not guilty of the charges. This

pre-supposes that when a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the

trial judge, the benefit of that doubt should be given to the accused. That

is what the learned trial judge appear to have done in this case.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the view that it has no basis to

interfere with the judgment dated 2015-02-19, pronounced by the learned

High Court Judge of Colombo.

Thus, this Court decides to refuse this application. It should stand

dismissed.
