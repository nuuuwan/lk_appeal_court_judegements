L. T .B.Dehideniya J.

The petitioner in this case is seeking to quash an order of the 1 st

Respondent dated 15.06.2016 made on an appeal made against an order

of the 2nd Respondent da~ed 29.01.2016. The Petitioner, prior to this case,

filed the writ application No. 134/2016 before this Court seeking a

mandate to quash the said order of the 2nd Respondent dated 29.01.2016

and was dismissed without issuing notice to the Respondents. In this

application the Petitioner is seeking to quash the order made on the

appeal in the same issue.

The first application was dismissed on several grounds. Among the

reasons for dismissal, one fundamental reason is non disclosure of a

material fact, that the order of the 2nd Respondent dated 29.01.2016 was

affirmed by the 1st Respondent on 15.06.2016. In the present case the

Petitioner submits that the previous application was filed prior to the said

order of the 1 st Respondent being delivered and there was no possibility

to plead the said order in the previous petition. Further he submits that the

present application is to quash the order dated 15.06.2016.

The first application was supported on 29.08.2016 that is after the

order dated 15.06.2016 being delivered. The Court was of the view that

the Petitioner should have disclosed the fact that the appeal referred to in

the application has been decided by the 1 st Respondent and the decision

of the 2nd Respondent has been confirmed. The Court considered that the

non disclosure of this fact is non disclosure of a material fact.

When the previous application was supported the Petitioner was

aware of the fact that the order of the 2nd Respondent has been confirmed

by the 1 st Respondent. Without disclosing that fact to the Court in the said

application it was supported and the application was dismissed. Now the

Petitioner in this application again moving this Court to quash the said

order which was not disclosed to the Court earlier. The Petitioner should

have disclosed the fact that the order canvassed was affirmed by the

appellate body and should have made an appropriate application. Without

doing it, the Petitioner cannot come before this Court again, for the

second time, to canvass the order of 1 st Respondent. There must be an end

to litigation.

We see no reason to issue notice.

The application dismissed without costs.
