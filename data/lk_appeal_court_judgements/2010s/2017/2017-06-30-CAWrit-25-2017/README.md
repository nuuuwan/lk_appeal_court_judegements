ORDER

P Padman Surasena J

Petitioners in this application, has sought inter alia, Writs of Certiorari and

Mandamus in terms of Article 140 of the Constitution of the Democratic

\

7

Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. As they also have sought interim reliefs in

their prayers, this Court heard the submissions of learned counsel

representing all the concerned parties in this case. They had subsequently

filed their written submissions also. Thus this Court will have to first decide

whether this Court should issue notices on the Respondents.

All development activities within the city of Colombo are expected to be

carried out according to the 'City of Colombo Development Plan'.

'City of Colombo Development Plan (Amendment) - 2008' is a plan to

amend the 'City of Colombo Development Plan 1999' approved on 15th

March 1999 by the Minister of Housing and Urban Development by virtue

of the powers vested in him under section 8F of the Urban Development

Authority Law No. 41 of 1978.

The Petitioners in this case sought to argue that the drafters of clause 5 of

the said Development Plan which is to the effect that ' ... The mixed

Development Zone along the Western side of the Galle Road, the

Commercial Zone along the Southern side of the Ward Place and Special

Mixed Residential Zone along both sides of Havelock Road extend up to

the end of the front lots having a frontage from each of those roads ... '

intended only the front portions of the lands along the Ward Place to be

! ; 1 I l I I II

"

developed as a Commercial Zone. It is the submission of the Petitioners

that it is irrational to assume that by the inclusion of clause 5, the drafters

intended that the Commercial Zone be allowed to extend from the Ward

Place frontage of the plots of said lands right up to their rear boundary, as

depicted in the printout of the Ariel view of the Ward Place areas produced

marked p2i.

It is therefore the Petitioners' submission that the 1st Respondent has

erred in granting the approval for the 5th Respondent to construct an

apartment complex consisting of 38 floors on the irrational basis that the

said premises is wholly located within the Commercial Zone.

It is in the above backdrop that the Petitioners in their application have

prayed inter alia, for

i. A writ of certiorari to quash the Preliminary Planning Certificate

marked "P 5" issued by the 1st Respondent;

ii. A writ of certiorari to quash the Development Permit marked "P 6"

issued by the 2nd Respondent;

1 Paragraph 8(b) of the petition.

f

9

iii. A writ of certiorari to quash the Environmental Recommendation

dated 23rd August 2016 marked "p 11" issued by the 4th

Respondent.

It is to be observed that clause 5 of the said Development Plan has

references to 3 areas namely

1. the Western side of the Galle Road - mixed Development Zone,

II. the Southern side of the Ward Place - Commercial Zone and

III. both sides of Havelock Road - Special Mixed Residential Zone.

It is apparent that the wording 'extend up to the end of the front lots

having a frontage from each of those roads' in the said clause 5 is a phrase

common to all 3 areas referred therein and hence is applicable to the lands

situated in the Southern side of the Ward Place. Therefore, those lands

could be permitted to be developed as being part of Commercial Zone

referred therein. It is the view of this Court that it is not open to interpret

the reference in the said Clause ' ..... extend up to the end of the front lots

having a frontage from each of those roads ... ' as having meant only the

front portions of those lands facing the Southern side of the Ward Place.

Further such interpretation is not possible as there is no yardstick to

1

!

I

\

ascertain as to how one could demarcate such front portion from the whole

block as the land in question is just one block of land. Petitioners have

failed to offer any explanation in this regard.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we see no basis or

justification for this Court to issue notices on the respondents.

Therefore we refuse to issue notices on the respondents and decide to

dismiss this application. However we make no order for costs.
