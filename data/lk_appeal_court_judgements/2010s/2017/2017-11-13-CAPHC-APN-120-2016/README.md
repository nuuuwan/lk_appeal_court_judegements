JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Applicant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Respondent) had issued a quit notice on the Respondent -

Petitioner - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Petitioner),

in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the Petitioner had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

4

to the Magistrate's Court of Kandy seeking an order to evict the Petitioner

from the land described in the schedule to the said application.

Learned Magistrate after an inquiry had pronounced the order dated 2016-

03-31 evicting the Appellant from the said land on the basis that he had

failed to produce a permit or due authority to remain in the said land.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate, the

Petitioner had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of

Central Province holden at Kandy seeking a revision of the order of the

learned Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court after the said application was supported in Court,

had refused to issue notices on the Respondents by its order dated 2016 -

05-23, holding that there is no basis to find any illegality in the learned

Magistrate.

It is against that order that the Petitioner has filed this application in this

Court.

The position taken up by the Petitioner in the Provincial High Court is that

the quit notice was not duly served on him. Learned Provincial High Court

Judge has refused to issue notices on the Respondents as the Petitioner

5

had failed to raise the said issues before the Magistrate's Court. Provincial

High Court had taken the view that such issues cannot be raised for the

\ t first time before the appellate forum.

The above issue appears to be a question of fact in respect of which there

is no pronouncement by the original Court.

In any case, the purpose of issuing a quit notice is to provide adequate

time for the occupier to vacate the relevant premises. In the case of

Gunarathne V Abeysinghe,l it was held that the occupier in that case has

had adequate time to make arrangements even though the stipulated time

of 30 days had not been given. Hence, in that case it was held that no

prejudice was caused to the occupier in that case. In the instant case, also

the situation is the same.

The other grounds urged by the Petitioner are factual positions, which had

not warranted any intervention by the Provincial High Court.

Thus, this Court sees no merit in this application.

Indeed perusal of the journal entries in the docket does not indicate either

it was satisfied that there is a matter to be looked into or that it had issued

notices on the Respondent. There is no record that this application had

been supported by the Petitioner for notices. Therefore, the Petitioner is

anyway not entitled to maintain this application.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to dismiss this application

with costs.

Application is dismissed with costs.
