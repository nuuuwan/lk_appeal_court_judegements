The parties did not dispute the identity of the corpus. It was admitted that the corpus is depicted

as lots 2 to 6 in plan no. 35 prepared by licensed surveyor Sisira Amendra. The dispute revolved

on the title to the corpus.

The plaintiff claimed paper title and submitted that 1120/1200 share of the corpus should be

allotted to him while the balance 80/1200 share should be allotted to the original pt defendant,

Nanayakkarawasam Kalupahana Liyanage Cyril Dias (hereinafter referred to as "pt defendant").

He further stated that the 2nd defendant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as "2nd defendant")

is made a party to the action to give notice of the action as she is in unlawful occupation of the

corpus.

The 2nd defendant claimed that she was in possession of the corpus from 1948 and thereby

claimed prescriptive title. She sought a dismissal of the plaintiff's action.

The learned District Judge of Galle held that the 2nd defendant had established prescriptive title

to the corpus and dismissed the action with costs. Hence this appeal by the plaintiff. The plaintiff

moves that the judgment of the learned District Judge dated 7th July 1999 be set aside and

judgment be entered as prayed for in the plaint.

Two grounds have been urged on behalf of the substituted-plaintiff-appellant (hereinafter

referred to as "appellant") to assail the judgment of the learned District Judge. Firstly, it is

submitted that it is a perfunctory judgment which fails to comply with Section 187 of the Civil

Procedure Code. Secondly, it is submitted that the learned District Judge has failed to investigate

title as required by law.

Perfunctory Judgment

The appellant submits that the learned District Judge has failed to comply with Section 187 of the

Civil Procedure Code. This mandates that a judgment shall contain a concise statement of the

case, the pOints for determination, the decision thereon, and the reasons for such decision. Bare

answers to issues or points of contest-whatever may be the name given to them-are insufficient

unless all matters which arise for decision under each head are examined. 1 Evidence germane to

each issue must be reviewed or examined. 2 Answering only points of contest raised by one party

in a partition action and failing to consider the points of contest raised by other parties amounts

to denial of justice to the latter parties for no fault of theirs. Failure to consider the deeds and

other documents produced by the respondents at the trial leads to the conclusion, considering

the rights of the respondents, there had in fact been a miscarriage of justice.3

The appellant submitted that the learned District Judge erred in answering issues 1, 2 and 3 in

the negative. Those issues are as follows:

1. e 25)8lo Cfl(Ob <yt)e ~e Cf8ti3Z5)ch 9125'5Bd' (j'8c.:ld' eJOc.:lBoCD Cfe~ed'Z5)6 l(?

e5 l(?

3. ol-&8Z5)61 e:lCD 1 elz53 eJtrl'ti3Z5)6I ec0 Z5)oeole6:l'w &3Z5)?

The learned District Judge has answered all three issues in the negative. However, the judgment

does not contain any reasons for such findings. It may well be that they were answered in the

negative as the learned District Judge was of the view that the prescriptive title pleaded by the

2nd defendant was proved. However, the case of the 2nd defendant is that she has prescribed to

the corpus having possessed it from 1948. Hence the earliest that the 2nd defendant could have

claimed prescriptive title was from 1958. But the case of the appellant is that his title begins with

Francis Eliyas Wijayasinghe Abeysekera who transferred his rights by deed no. 1878 dated 31st

May 1903 to Jane Wijayasinghe Abeysekere, Gerad Upatissa De Alwis, Mervyn George Henry De

Alwis, and Rosabel Neeta De Alwis. The learned District Judge has not examined this chain of title

pleaded by the plaintiff. The learned District Judge should have at least evaluated the evidence,

including the relevant deeds, some of which were marked in evidence without objection.

Thereafter, if he found that the 2nd defendant has prescribed to the corpus, the above issues

should have been answered IIYes. But the 2nd defendant has prescribed to the corpus."4

Furthermore, as set out below the learned District Judge has failed to evaluate the requirements

and evidence in support of the prescriptive title pleaded by the 2nd defendant.

In the circumstances, I am of the view that there is merit in the submission that the judgment is

perfunctory and fails to comply with Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code. Is that a ground by

itself to set aside the judgment?

The proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment, decree or order of any

court shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. Therefore, even

where there is a failure to comply with Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code, if it is evident on

a close examination of the totality of the evidence that the learned District Judge is correct in

pronouncing judgment in favour of the 2nd defendant, there is no prejudice to the substantial

rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice and the judgment of the learned District

Judge should not be disturbed.s

Hence, I will now consider whether the learned District Judge was correct in concluding that the

2nd defendant has prescribed to the corpus. In doing so, I am mindful of the statement of Marsoof

J. in Francis Samarawickrema v. Hilda Jayasinghe6 and another where he stated:

"The Court of Appeal has in this case failed to observe the time tested principle enunciated by

James L. J. in The Sir Robert Peel, (32) at 322 which was quoted with approval by Viscount Sankey

L. C in Powell and Wife V. Streatham Manor Nursing Home, (33)at 248, that an appellate court-

"will not depart from the rule it has laid down that it will not over-rule the decision of the Court

below on a question of fact in which the Judge has had the advantage of seeing the witnesses

and observing their demeanour unless they find some governing fact which in relation to

others has created a wrong impression."7

However, the demeanor of witnesses' pale into insignificance in this case as the learned District

Judge who pronounced the judgment observed only the evidence of the son of the 2nd defendant

who testified that much of his knowledge derived from statements made by the 2nd defendant.

In any event, the learned District Judge has not referred to his evidence in the judgment. The

material witnesses, namely Herbert Colin Dahanayake (plaintiff), Cyril Gunawardena and

Kariyawasam Majuwana Gamage Agnes (2nd defendant) testified before two other judges.

Investigation of Title

Section 25(1) of the Partition Law requires the court to examine the title of each party and hear

and receive evidence in support thereof. It has been consistently held that it is the duty of the

Court to examine and investigate title in a partition action, because the judgement is a judgement

in rem. In Gnanapandithen and another v. 8a/anayagam and another G.P.S. De Silva c.J.

explained this duty as follows:

"Mr. Samarasekera cited several decisions which have, over the years, emphasized the

paramount duty cast on the court by the statute itself to investigate title. It is unnecessary

to repeat those decisions here. For present purposes it would be sufficient to refer to the

case of Mather v. Thamotharam Pillai (2) decided as far back as 1903, where Layard, CJ.

stated the principle in the following term: - "Now, the question to be decided in a partition

suit is not merely matters between parties which may be decided in a civil action; ...

The court has not only to decide the matters in which the parties are in dispute, but to

safeguard the interests of others who are not parties to the suit, who will be bound by

a decree for partition ... "Layard, CJ. stressed the importance of the duty cast on the

court to satisfy itself "that the plaintiff has made out a title to the land sought to be

partitioned, and that the parties before the court are those solely entitled to such land."

(emphasis added). "9

The plaintiff claims paper title. The chain of title set out in the plaint begins with Francis Elias

Wijayasinghe Abeysekere as the original owner. He transferred his rights by deed no. 1878 dated

31st May 1903 to {a} Jane Wijayasinghe Abeysekere, {b} Gerad Upatissa De Alwis, {c} Mervyn

George Henry De Alwis, and {d} Rosabel Neeta De Alwis. The four of them transferred their shares

to Cyril Gunawardena by deed no. 615 dated 23rd September 1947 (ol.2) who in turn transferred

an undivided 2 roods by deed no. 493 dated 23rd December 1958 to Cyril Dias who was the pt

defendant in the partition action and the balance 3/5 share to the plaintiff by deed no. 2866

dated 5th July 1984{ol.3). It was further claimed that Cyril Gunawardena transferred the balance

2/5 share to the plaintiff by deed no. 2898 dated 20th July 1984 (Ol.4).

Cyril Gunawardena testified that he bought the corpus in 1947 by deed no. 615 dated 23 rd

September 1947(ol.2). Thomas Dias, who is sometimes referred to as "Ralahamy" in the

evidence, was a witness to this deed. Thomas Dias was the cousin of Cyril Gunawardena as their

mothers were sisters. Cyril Gunawardena later married a daughter of Thomas Dias. Thus, there

was a close family relationship between Thomas Dias and Cyril Gunawardena built on trust. This

came out as follows during his cross examination by the counsel for the 2nd defendant:

(Appeal brief page 180)

Cyril Gunawardena testified that Thomas Dias looked after the corpus and gave him a portion of

the income and that Thomas Dias brought the 2nd defendant and her husband to the corpus to

look after it.

Upon perusal of the deeds marked in this action and the evidence, it is clear that Cyril

Gunawardena bought the corpus in 1947 and gave possession to his cousin (later father-in-law)

Thomas Dias to look after it. The line of cross examination by counsel for 2nd defendant is

premised on this footing. The plaintiff derives title from Cyril Gunawardena. In this context the

question is whether the 2nd defendant had acquired prescriptive title by possession of the corpus

as claimed.

In D.R. Kiriamma v. J.A. Podibanda and 8 others10 Udalagama J. adverted to some important

points to be borne in mind in considering a claim of prescriptive title:

"Onus probandi or the burden of proving possession is on the party claiming prescriptive

possession. Importantly, prescription is a question of fact. Physical possession is a factum

probandum. I am inclined to the view that considerable circumspection is necessary to

recognize the prescriptive title as undoubtedly it deprives the ownership of the party

having paper title. It is in fact said that title by prescription is an i"egality made legal due

to the other party not taking action. It is to be reiterated that in Sri Lanka prescriptive title

is required to be by title adverse to an independent to that of a claimant or plaintiff. "11

Where a party invokes the provisions of section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance in order to defeat

the ownership of an adverse claimant to immovable property the burden of proof rests fairly and

squarely on him to establish the starting point for his or her acquisition of prescriptive rights. 12

The 2nd "defendant claims that she possessed the corpus from 1948. Was this the beginning of

adverse possession?

Clearly there was a close family relationship between Cyril Gunawardena and Thomas Dias. In

our society family relationships are considered important and attracts a certain degree of trust.

A family member is trusted more than an outsider. Courts appear to have taken this into

consideration on the question of adverse possession in a claim of prescriptive title. In De Silva v.

Commissioner General of Inland Revenue13 Sharvananda J. (as he was then) stated that:

liThe principle of law is well established that a person who bases his title in adverse

possession must show by clear and unequivocal evidence that his possession was hostile

to the real owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property claimed. In order

to constitute adverse possession, the possession must be in denial of the title of the true

owner. The acts of the person in possession should be irreconcilable with the rights of the

true owner; the person in possession must claim to be so as of right as against the true

owner. Where there is no hostility to or denial of the title of the true owner there can be

no adverse possession. In deciding whether the alleged acts of the person constitute

adverse possession, regard must be had to the animus of the person doing those acts,

and this must be ascertained from the facts and circumstances of each case and the

relationship of the parties. Possession which may be presumed to be adverse in the case

of a stranger may not attract such a presumption, in the case of persons standing in

certain social or legal relationships. The presumption represents the most likely

inference that may be drawn in the context of the relationship of the parties. The Court

will always attribute possession to a lawful title where that is possible. Where the

possession may be either lawful or unlawful, it must be assumed, in the absence of

evidence, that the possession is lawful. Thus, where property belonging to the mother is

held by the son, the presumption will be that the enjoyment of the son was on behalf of

and with the permission of the mother. Such permissive possession is not in denial of the

title of the mother and is consequently not adverse to her. It will not enable the

possession to acquire title by adverse possession. Where possession commenced with

permission, it will be presumed to so continue until and unless something adverse

occurred about it. The onus is on the licensee to show when and how the possession

became adverse. Continued appropriation of the income and payment of taxes will not

be sufficient to convert permissive possession into adverse possession, unless such

conduct unequivocally manifests denial of the permitter's title. In order to discharge

such onus, there must be clear and affirmative evidence of the change in the character of

possession. The evidence must point to the time of commencement of adverse

possession. Where the parties were not at arms length, strong evidence of a positive

character is necessary to establish the change of character."14 (emphasis added)

This principle has been applied in a contest between brother and sister.15 Taking into

consideration the evidence led in this case, I have no difficulty in applying the prinCiple to the

relationship between Cyril Gunawardena and Thomas Dias. It is true that Thomas Dias was not a

party to the partition action (Thomas Dias and the pt Defendant Cyril Dias are not the one and

the same as submitted by the appellant in his written submissions) and did not claim prescriptive

title against the plaintiff's predecessor in title. However, the evidence of the 2nd defendant is that

she became the mistress of Thomas Dias around 1949 by which time her husband had deserted

her due to this relationship. They had three children from this relationship and Thomas Dias was

named as their father.

14 Ibid. page 296

15 Leisa and another v. Simon and Another (2002) 1 SrLL.R. 148

10

Mere general statements of witnesses that a party possessed the land in dispute for a number of

years exceeding the prescriptive period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse

possession necessary to support a title by prescription. It is necessary that the witnesses should

speak to specific facts and the question of possession has to be decided thereupon by Court.16

The 2nd defendant stated that she came to vanrooyen estate, which adjoined the corpus, in 1947

with her husband, children and her father and in 1948 they cleared the corpus and came into

possession. I am of the view that her evidence does not establish that the 2nd defendant began

adverse possession of the corpus in 1948 as claimed. On the contrary her evidence is more akin

to a facile story of walking into abandoned premises after the Japanese air raid which material is

far too slender to found a claim based on prescriptive titleY Her claim to possession in 1948 is

more compatible with the position of the plaintiff that she and her family were placed in

possession by Thomas Dias who was the licensee of Cyril Gunwardena. At the most the

commencement of the possession of the 2nd defendant in 1948 is as a licensee of Thomas Dias.

A person who has entered into possession of land in one capacity is presumed to continue to

possess it in the same capacity. Bertram c.J. in Tillekeratne v. Bastian18 explained the effect of

this principle as follows:

liThe effect of this principle is that, where any person's possession was originally not

adverse, and he claims that it has become adverse, the onus is on him to prove it. And

what must he prove? He must prove not only an intention on his part to possess

adversely, but a manifestation of that intention to the true owner against whom he sets

up his possession. The burden he must assume is, in fact, both definite and heavy, and

the authorities have been accustomed to emphasize its severe nature. Thus, it is

sometimes said that he must prove an II overt unequivocal act II (per Wendt J. in Perera v.

Menchi Nona)."19

Has the 2nd defendant fulfilled this heavy burden? The 2nd defendant stated that Thomas Dias

paid taxes for the corpus until his death in 1979. She further stated that at the time of his death

Thomas Dias was living with her in the house situated on the corpus. The admission that Thomas

Dias paid taxes for the corpus until 1979 is indicative of the 2nd defendant's possession been

based on her relationship with Thomas Dias who in turn was a licensee of Cyril Gunawardena.

The corpus consists of both high and paddy. An extract of a paddy land register was marked as

0i' 5 which shows that it was issued on 25.02.1987. There the tenant cultivator is identified as

Thomas Dias and the landlord as Cyril Gunawardena, the plaintiff's predecessor in title. The 2nd

defendant accepted that the document related to part of the corpus.

The preliminary survey report prepared by Sisira Amendra licensed surveyor in 1985 refers to a

few constructions including wells, toilet and house. However, no evidence is available as to when

they were constructed. The 2nd defendant claimed that there were no constructions on the

corpus when she came into possession in 1948. Her evidence is incompatible with the details in

the schedule to deed no. 615 dated 23 rd September 1947 (oi.2) by which Cyril Gunawardena

obtained title to the corpus. There is a reference to buildings in that schedule. This evidence is

compatible with the evidence of Cyril Gunawardena who testified that there was a large house

on the corpus when he bought it.

The earliest point of time which can be referred to adverse possession beginning in favour of the

2nd defendant is 1976 when Cyril Gunawardena made a complaint to the Conciliation Board

against the 2nd defendant. The complaint was that the 2nd defendant was occupying a house

illegally. The partition action was filed in 1984, eight years from the date of complaint. This is not

sufficient to establish prescriptive title.

For the foregoing reasons I am of the view that the learned District Judge erred in concluding that

the 2nd defendant had established prescriptive title to the corpus.

12

I am of the opinion that justice will not be served by sending this matter back to the District Court

for trial de novo. Action was filed in 1984 more than 33 years ago. The main witnesses who can

testify on prescription are Herbert Colin Dahanayake (plaintiff), Cyril Gunawardena and

Kariyawasam Majuwana Gamage Agnes (2nd defendant). Herbert Collin Dahanayake is dead. Cyril

Gunawardena and Kariyawasam Majuwana Gamage Agnes (2 nd defendant), if alive, will both be

89 years old. In these circumstances, in the interests of justice, I will consider whether the

partition action can be determined on the available evidence.

Section 2 of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 provides for a partition action to be filed where any

land belongs in common to two or more owners. The plaintiff in this case pleaded that the 1st

defendant Cyril Dias was the owner of an undivided 2 roods of the corpus by virtue of deed no.

493 dated 23rd December 1958. Hence the maintainability of the partition action depends on

establishing title of the pt defendant to the said undivided 2 roods or at least establishing that

an undivided 2 roods of the corpus is owned by a third party.

The pt defendant did not file a statement of claim or take part at the trial. During the evidence

of the plaintiff there was an attempt to mark in evidence deed no. 493 dated 23rd December 1958

as 101. This is how the proceedings of 1992.02.10 reads:

The appellant submitted that deed no. 493 dated 23rd December 1958 was in fact marked as 1t)1

and is evidence in view of Section 154 of the Civil Procedure Code. It was submitted that the

learned District Judge erred in not calling for and taking custody of it. Reliance is placed on

Podiralahamy v. Ran Banda20 where it was held that there is a duty on Court to take the

documents tendered and marked at the trial to its custody and keep them filed of record and

that documents marked in evidence become part of the record.

I am unable to accept that deed no. 493 dated 23rd December 1958 marked as 181 was in fact

admitted in evidence. The mere marking of a document during evidence does not necessarily

mean it has been admitted as evidence. The explanation to Section 154(3) of the Civil Procedure

Code dictates that whether a document is admitted or not it should be marked as soon as any

witness makes a statement with regard to it and if not earlier marked on this account, it must, at

least, be marked when the court decides upon admitting it. What has happened on 1992.02.10

is that deed no. 493 dated 23rd December 1958 was marked as 181 as soon as the plaintiff made

reference to it. At that point the counsel for the 2nd defendant objected to it been marked for the

reasons set out in the proceedings. It appears that thereafter no further steps were taken to get

deed no. 493 dated 23 rd December 1958 marked 181 admitted as evidence. Strictly speaking the

learned District Judge should have ruled on its acceptance in evidence by addressing his mind to

the two questions set out in the explanation to Section 154(3) of the Civil Procedure Code.

However, his failure to do so does not amount to it having been admitted in evidence. This is

clear as the original case record does not contain 181. Furthermore, it was not led in evidence at

the close of the case for the plaintiff on 8th July 1994. Accordingly, Podiralahamy v. Ran Banda2l

has no application to the circumstances of this case. In the above circumstances the plaintiff has

failed to establish that an undivided extent of 2 roods of the corpus was transferred to the r t

defendant.

The only question left to be considered is whether the plaintiff has at least established that an

undivided 2 roods of the corpus is owned by a third party. Jane Wijayasinghe Abeysekere, Gerad

Upatissa De Alwis, Mervyn George Henry De Alwis, and Rosabel Neeta De Alwis transferred their

shares to Cyril Gunawardena by deed no. 615 dated 23 rd September 1947 (15(.2). The schedule to

the deed sets out the extent of Rukattana Gaha Henabedda alias Beraliyadolawatta half portion,

the corpus in the partition action, as A.7 R. 2 P. O. Cyril Gunawardena transferred a balance 3/5

share to the plaintiff by deed no. 2866 dated 5th July 1984(15(.3). The schedule thereto identifies

Cyril Gunawardena

transferred the balance 2/5 share to the plaintiff by deed no. 2898 dated 20th July 1984 (15(.4).

The schedule thereto also identifies the extent so transferred as "@'Zi):)@'Q)~ q~Z5)6 Q):)0)c.JZ5) @

qcleD16". This establishes that the plaintiff obtained title to Rukattana Gaha Henabedda alias

Beraliyadolawatta half portion except for "@'Zi):)@'Q)~ q~Z5)6 Q):)0)c.JZ5) @". This evidence proves

that the corpus is co-owned although, for the reasons stated earlier, the ownership to the

balance portion of "@'Zi):)@'Q)~ q~Z5)6 Q):)0)c.JZ5) @" is not established. In the circumstances, the

plaintiff has only established that he is entitled to an undivided 1120/1200 share of the corpus

while the balance portion of "@'Zi):)@'Q)~ q~Z5)6 Q):)0)c.JZ5) @" should be left unallotted.

For the foregoing reasons, I allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the learned District

Judge of Galle dated 7th December 1999. I further hold that the plaintiff is entitled to 1120/1200

share of the corpus while the balance 80/1200 should be left unallotted. The learned District

Judge of Galle is directed to enter interlocutory decree accordingly and take further steps as

prescribed by law.
