ARGUED &

DECIED ON: 31.01.2017

A.H.M.D. Nawaz,l

Counsel for the petitioner supports his application for a writ of

certiorari to quash P28 and P37 for the reasons set out in the petition

dated 21.06.2006. In opposition to this application, the Counsel for

the 4th respondent and the Hon. Attorney General have taken a

preliminary objection on the basis that the petitioner has no locus

standi to maintain this application. Mr. Manohara de Silva, PC has

outlined the preliminary objections with which the learned senior

1

f !

fI! ,I

Deputy Solicitor General tvlr Arjuna Obeysekara has concurred. Mr.

T.M.S Nanayakkara who Cipr)t~ars for the petitioner has responded to

the preliminary objectioli '-basing his argument on the written

submissions that he has fllEd before this Court. The basis of the

preliminary objections is thai the documents that are sought to be

quashed namely P28 and ;Y{ P do not pertain to the petitioner before

this Court. The document """c1rked P28 which is dated 24.01.02, is an

annual permit granted ,. the Western Provincial Transport Co-

operative Society giving Cl of'rmit to the said co-operative society to

develop the land as de~;(rtned morefully in the said permit with

conditions attached therptc One of the conditions, as has been

pOinted out by the learne(1 Sf 'nior Deputy Solicitor General, is that the

permit holder namely thE' \\estern Provincial Transport Cooperative

Society cannot alienate (d , . ansfer the jus in re aliena namely the

right to develop the land;llven in P28 to any other person and this

right has been restricted "I: the permit holder in the said permit.

Among other conditions (It "'lis permit is the date of expiry which is

specified to be the 3151 ::)t December 2002. In other words by

2

31.12.2002, this land, by the very terms of this permit, ought to have

reverted to the state. P28 which is a document to alienation of a state

land it has expired on 31.12.2002. However, this application has been

filed on 21.06.2006 almost four years later after the document has

outlived its usefulness as far back as 31.12.2002.

P28 is a document which is no longer valid after 31 December 2002

and as P28 was never issued in the petitioner's name, P28 could not

have affected the rights of the petitioner and this document cannot

form the basis of an application for prohibition as no steps have been

taken to eject the petitioner based on this document marked P28.

Therefore, this Court sustains the preliminary objection raised on

behalf of the respondent in regard to the issue of writ of prohibition

based on P28.

The other document that is sought to be quashed by a writ of

certiorari is the letter dated 31.08.2005 issued by the 1st

respondent(P37). This document too does not vest any right in the

petitioner and if at all when this document was issued on the 31st

August 2005, it was in assertion of the rights of the State in regard to

3

II II II I

the land which is the subject matter of this application. The petitioner

is unable to show that an~ r luhts affecting the petitioner flow from the

issuance of letter marked p~; and it is in these circumstances that the

respondent resists this appk:ation on the basis of a lack of locus

standi. Mr. T.M.S. Nanc1vaKkara responding to this preliminary

objection states that thE' I lmmissioner of cooperative society by

virtue of powers vested int t las transferred the assets of the Western

Province Cooperative Tral'sp,)rt Society to the petitioner. It appears

that there is no proof bpfl)f t~ this Court that the Western Province

Cooperative Transport S(){~lety had any assests after 31 December

2002 for them to be alipnCtted to the petitioner, as the said Co-

operative Transport Society t:ad only a permit to develop a land until

its expiry on 31 Decem t)f> , 2002. There is no other document

produced before this C llH

O

' or evidence that would sustain an

application for judicial revipv>i on the ground of legitimate expectation.

In the circumstances, thi' : ourt takes the view that P37 does not

affect in any way the right<: ,f the petitioner, which are sustainable in

administrative justice. Thf'retore, this Court upholds the preliminary

4

objections raised on behalf of the respondents and dismisses the

application.
