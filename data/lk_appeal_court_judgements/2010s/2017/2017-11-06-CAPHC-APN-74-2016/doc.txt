JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Accused Respondent in this case was indicted by the Hon. Attorney

General in the High Court of Kandy on two counts. Both counts have

alleged that he, on or about 2014-03-13, at Bogambara, had committed

grave sexual abuse of a boy below the age of 16 years, an offence

punishable under section 365 B (2) (b ) of the Penal Code as amended by

Acts No. 22 of 1995, No. 29 of 1998 and No. 16 of 2006.

The Accused Petitioner, upon the charge in the indictment being read over

and explained to him, had pleaded guilty to both the charges. Learned

High Court Judge had accordingly convicted the Accused Respondent on

both counts and had passed sentence on him.

Hon. Attorney General being aggrieved by the said sentence has filed this

revision application seeking a revision of the sentence from this Court.

Learned counsel for the Accused Respondent raised several preliminary

objections against the maintainability of this application in this Court. One

of the said objections is that the Complainant Petitioner has failed to

4

submit with the petition, a certified copy of the relevant proceedings before

the High Court. As the learned DSG has conceded that he has not filed

such certified copy, this Court is of the view that it can dispose this matter

only by addressing that issue. It would be in order to commence examining

this issue with the re-production of Rule 3 (1) (a)l which states as follows:

" ... Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the

Constitution shall be by way of petition, together with an affidavit in

support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the

originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies

thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any

such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the

leave of the Court to furnish such documents later. Where a petitioner fails

to comply with the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or

at the instance of any party, dismiss such application.

(b) Every application by way of revision or restitutio in intergrum under

Article 138 of the constitution shall be made in like manner together with

1 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

f

copies of the relevant proceedings (including pleadings and documents

produced), in the Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution to

which such application relates ............. "

"

It is to be observed that the Complainant Petitioner is praying that this Court

should set aside the sentence imposed on the Accused Respondent by the

learned High Court Judge and substitute therefore an adequate sentence

according to law and the circumstances of this case.

In order to clearly ascertain the nature of the complaint made to this court

by the Complainant Petitioner, this Court must be provided with a duly

certified copy of the proceedings material to the application. What has been

submitted by the Complainant Petitioner before this Court remains to be a

set of papers without any authoritative signature or certification. The

signature of an unidentified person in the stamp containing words

"TRUE COpy

Attorney at Law for Petitioner"

6

does not establish that the said set of papers is a duly certified copy. It is

not possible to ascertain as to who has signed or on what authority or basis

the said signatory could have stated that it is a true copy. The question that

cries out for an answer, would be "what is meant by 'True Copy'?" However,

this Court cannot see the existence of any acceptable answer to the above

question.

According to Rule 3 (1) (a) cited above, it is a duly certified copy of the

proceedings material to the application and not a 'true copy' that the

Petitioner is required to submit with his application. It is not the Attorney at

Law for the Petitioner2 who has the authority to duly certify an extract taken

from a case record.

This rule underlines the importance of the presence of an authoritative and

responsible signatory certifying such copies taking the responsibility for the

authenticity of such documents. Insisting on tendering to Court, such duly

certified copies of relevant proceedings is not without any valid and logical

reasons. Courts make orders relying on such documents. They may

sometimes have serious effects on people. The persons who may be so

affected might sometimes be not limited to parties of the case only. Drastic

repercussions may ensue in case the Court makes such orders on some set

of papers, authenticity of which would subsequently become questionable.

That is one of the reasons as to why tendering of duly certified copies of the

relevant documents to Court has been made mandatory by the Rules.

It is to be noted that the Court is empowered to exercise in a revision

application3, any of the powers it could exercise in an appeal. Unlike in a

revision application, the original case record is before the appellate Court,

when it exercises its appellate jurisdiction. Therefore, no such problem would

crop up when Courts exercise its appellate jurisdiction4

The Complainant Petitioner has requested this Court to impose a custodial

jail sentence (instead of the suspended sentence) on the Accused

Respondent. Therefore, it stands to reason that this Court should see for

itself at least a duly certified copy of the proceedings before it could reverse

an order made by a Court of Law which in this case is High Court. However,

no such document has been submitted by the Petitioner for the perusal of

this Court.

Thus, this Court has no alternative but to conclude that there is no material

before this Court to consider the application filed by the Complainant

Petitioner.

Rule 3 (13)5 states that it shall be the duty of the petitioner to take such

steps as may be necessary to prosecute his application with due diligence.

Although Rule 3 (1) (a)6 provides that Where a petitioner is unable to

tender any such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and

seek the leave of the Court to furnish such documents later, the

Complainant Petitioner has not been interested in that too. Instead, the

Petition shows that the Complainant Petitioner has identified what he has

produced as P 2 to be a certified copy.7 This is erroneous on the learned

DSG's own admission.

Rule 3 (1) (a)8 further provides that where a petitioner fails to comply with

the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or at the instance

of any party, dismiss such application.

5 Court of Appeai (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

6 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

7 Paragraph 3 of the Petition.

8 Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990.

In the case of Shanmugawadivu Vs Kulathilake9 the Supreme court has

held as follows " ....... the new Rules permit an applicant to file documents

later, if he has stated his inability in filing the relevant documents along

with his application, and had taken steps to seek the leave of the Court to

furnish such documents. In such circumstances, the only kind of discretion

that could be exercised by Court is to see whether and how much time

could be permitted for the filing of papers in due course.

The Complainant Petitioner had made no such statement in his petition.

Therefore, this Court has to conclude that he was not interested in making

duly certified copies of relevant proceedings available for the perusal of this

Court. Thus, in the absence of the relevant documents, this Court is unable

to exercise its revisionary powers in respect of the order sought to be

revised.

As has been decided in the case of Brown & Co. Ltd. and another Vs.

Ratnayake, Arbitrator and others10 (which is a case where the dismissal by

. . the Court of Appeal of an application for a Writ on the basis of a failure on

10

the part of the petitioner in that case to annex to the petition, certified

copies of relevant proceedings with regard to the particular dispute),

the Complainant Petitioner in the instant case too is not entitled to proceed

to the next step without compliance with a valid invocation of jurisdiction in

the first place.ll

In these circumstances, the only option for this Court is to decide to refuse

this application. This application should therefore stand dismissed.

We make no order for costs.

Application is dismissed.
