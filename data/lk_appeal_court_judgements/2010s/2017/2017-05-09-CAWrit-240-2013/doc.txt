JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Petitioner in this application seeks to challenge her non selection for the

post of 'Probationary Lecturer in Fundamentals in Unani', a post that was

advertised by the 1st Respondent namely the Institute of Indigenous

Medicine, University of Colombo.

The 2nd - 23rd Respondents are the members of the Board of Management

of the 1st Respondent Institute of which the 2nd Respondent is the

Chairman.

2nd 3rd ih 16th 24h and 25th Respondents are the members of the , , , ,

interview panel which interviewed the Petitioner.

The 26th Respondent is the University of Colombo and the 2ih Respondent

is its Vice Chancellor. The 28th Respondent is the University Grants

Commission (hereinafter sometimes be referred to as UGC). The 29th

Respondent is the person who was selected by the interview panel for the

post the Petitioner too had applied for.

It would be convenient to list out at the outset, the main reliefs the

Petitioner has sought from this Court. They are as follows;

i. a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the part of

the advertisement produced marked P 5 by which, Arabic language

has been introduced as an additional qualification for recruitment to

the above post by the 1st Respondent institute and/ or any other

decisions incidental thereto;

ii. a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the selection

and/ or appOintment of the 29th Respondent to the post of

Probationary Lecturer in Fundamentals in Unani at the 1st

Respondent Institute;

iii. a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari to quash the

decision/s of anyone or more of the Respondents not to select and/

or appoint the Petitioner to the post of Probationary Lecturer in

Fundamentals in Unani at the 1st Respondent institute;

iv. a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Certiorari to quash any

decision/s taken to ratify and/ or approve the selection and

appointment of the 29th Respondent to the post of Probationary

Lecturer in Fundamentals in Unani at the 1st Respondent Institute;

v. a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Prohibition prohibiting the 29th

Respondent from functioning in the post of Probationary Lecturer in

Fundamentals in Unani at the 1st Respondent Institute;

vi. a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing anyone or

more of the Respondents to follow the scheme of Recruitment

stipulated in P 9 Ca) together with other applicable UGC Circulars

thereto and make appOintment to the post of Probationary Lecturer

in Fundamentals in Unani at the 1st Respondent institute

vii. a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing anyone or

more of the Respondents to appoint the Petitioner to the post of

Probationary Lecturer in Fundamentals in Unani at the 1st Respondent

Institute;

viii. a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Quo Warranto declaring that the

selection and/ or appointment of the 29th Respondent to the post of

Probationary Lecturer in Fundamentals in Unani at the 1st Respondent

Institute is invalid.

Having above prayers in mind it is now time to turn to the ground urged by

the Petitioner as to why she prays for such reliefs. The gist of the

argument advanced by the Petitioner is that the Respondents have

arbitrarily included Arabic language as a requisite qualification for the

relevant post although the UGC circular No. 721 dated 1997-11-21 and

UGC circular No. 935 dated 2010-10-25 produced marked P 9 (al and P 9

W respectively which regulate the recruitment scheme do not empower

the Respondents to include Arabic language as an additional requisite

qualification for the relevant post.

However it is revealed from the 3rd Respondent's affidavitl that the

aforementioned circulars have to be read with the document produced by

the Respondents marked 3 R 4 which confirms that the UGC at its 731st

meeting held on 2007-03-29 has decided to authorize the higher education

institutes to include as an additional clause if necessary when it is essential

to recruit a lecturer (Probationary) / Senior Lecturer to a Department in an

area of a particular speciality or sub speciality relevant to the subject.

The Petitioner in her Counter Affidavit has not controverted this position.

Thus, this Court has no basis to hold that the inclusion of Arabic language

as a requisite additional qualification for the relevant post by the

Respondents is arbitrary, unreasonable, irrational or procedurally flawed as

alleged by the Petitioner2.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner as well as the learned Counsel for the

Respondents have agreed before this Court that this Court should

pronounce the judgment in this case after considering the written

submissions the parties have filed. Therefore this judgment would be

based on the material that has been adduced by parties in their written

submissions.

The burden is on the Petitioner to prove before this Court that there is I

I.indeed a basis for this Court to issue the writs she had prayed for in her

petition. This Court made an attempt to locate whether there are any such

plausible arguments put forward in the written submission filed by the

2 As alleged in paragraph 14 of the petition.

Petitioner. However this Court is unable to gather any such basis from the

said written submission which appears to have only repeated some facts.

In these circumstances this Court has to conclude that it has no basis to

grant any relief prayed for by the Petitioner. This application is therefore

refused. It should stand dismissed with costs.
