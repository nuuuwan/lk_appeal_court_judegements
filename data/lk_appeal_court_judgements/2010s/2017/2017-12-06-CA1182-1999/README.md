Decided on 30/11/2017

M.M.A.GafToor,J.

This is an appeal filed by the Defendant-Appellant

against the Judgment dated 22/07 /1999 delivered by the

District Judge of Trincomalee. In this appeal Appellant raised

preliminary objection and stated that the case should be sent

back for re trial, without going into merit of the case, as the

Learned District Judge made order allowing the issues 23 to

27 on 22.07.1999 and answered the said issues in the

judgment delivered on the same day.

However this is a rei-vindicatio action filled by the

Plaintiff-Respondent in the District of Trincomalee against the

Defendant-Appellant seeking for following reliefs inter alia:

1. A declaration that the respondent is the owner of the

premIses which was described in the schedule to the

plaint.

3

II. For ejectment of the appellant and all those holding

under him from the said premises.

The defendant in his answer denied the averments

contained in the plaint, and prayed the Court for declaration

of title for the land morefully described in the schedule of his

answer.

And also, the Court fIxed for trial, prior to the trial both

parties raised issues and while giving evidence also parties

raised issues and totally 27 issues were recorded. The issues

No 23-27 raised by the plaintiffs counsel while the defendant

was giving evidence. And also the said issues 23-27 were not

allowed at the time of the trial and ordered separately

regarding the said issues the same day of the judgment and

prior to the judgment. It is clear there were no opportunities

given by the District Judge of Trincomalee to address the said

issues to the parties.

f

4 According to the decided case Avudaiappan Vs Indian

Overseas Bank 1995 2 SLR 131 was held, that "Section 146

of the Civil Procedure Code Permits Court of record issues on

which the right decision of the case appears to Court to defend

on the pleadings, documents and on evidence led at the trial."

However In Section 149 of the Civil Procedure Code

clearly states, "the Court may, at any time before passing a

decree, amended the issue or frame additional issues on such

terms as it thinks fit".

This Section as discussed in the case of Hameed Vs.

Cassim 1996 2 SLR Pg.30. It was held that the Court is

empowered to frame issues under Section 149 of the Civil

Procedure Code and the same can be framed by the Court in

the interest justice which is primarily to ensure the correct

decision is given in the case.

In this case District Court of Trincomallee did not frame

additional issues but raises by the party.

5 However in the said case Dr. Ranaraja, J., stated. " it is

not necessary that the new issue should arise on the

pleadings. A new issue could be framed on the evidence led by

the parties orally or in the form of documents. The only

restriction is that the Judge in framing a new issue should act

in the interests of justice, which is primarily to ensure the

correct decision is given in the case.

Bertram C.J. in Silva Vs. Obeysekar commenting on the

discretion of a judge to allow issues after the commencement

of the trial observed, "No doubt it is a matter within the

discretion of the Judge whether he will allow fresh issues to be

formulated after the case has commenced, but he should do so

when such a course appears to be in the interest of justice,

and it is certainly not a valid objection to such a course being

taken that they do not rise on the pleadings."

The Provisions of Section 149 considered along with the

observation of Betram C.J. certainly do not preclude a District

Judge from framing a new issue after the parties have closed

their respective cases and before the judgment is read out in

6 open court, it is not necessary that the new Issue should

arise on the pleadings. A new issue could be framed on the

evidence led by the parties orally or in the form of documents.

The only restriction is that the Judge in framing a new issue

should act in the interest of justice, which is primarily to

ensure the correct decision is given in the case. It also means

that the Judge must ensure that which it is considered

necessary to hear parties to arrive at the right decision on the

new issue, that they be permitted to lead fresh evidence or if it

is purely a question of law, that they be afforded an

opportunity to make submissions thereon.

In this matter Judge of District Court did not allow or

reject the issues Nos.23-27 and held he would give the order

on the objection t a later stage of this case. Therefore he had a

discretion power to give order at the later stage of trial or prior

to the judgment or the same day of judgment.

Even though the defendant had called all his witnesses

and he too gave evidences after the said issues were raised.

7 Therefore the defendant had enough opportunity to refute the

said issues.

Therefore I am in VIew, that the District Court of

Trincomalee did not erred in law in answering the said issues

23 to 27 in the judgment dated 22.07.1999 allowing the issue.

Therefore the preliminary objections IS over-ruled and

the case is fixed for hearing.
