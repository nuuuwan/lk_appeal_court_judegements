Decided on 03.08.2017

Deepali Wijesundera, J

Appellant along with two others were indicted in the High Court of

Puththalam for the murder of Warnakulasuriya Peduru Thisera

under section: 296 read with section: 32 of the Penel Code. They

were also indicted under section: 300 of the Penel Code for

attempting to murder Warnakulasuriya Petersincho Thisera.

After trial 2nd and 3rd accused were acquitted on both counts. 1 st

accused has been convicted for culpable homicide not amounting

to murder under section: 397 of the Penel Code and also for the

2nd count and sentenced to 11 rigorous imprisonment for the 1 st

count and three years rigorous imprisonment for the 2nd count,

he was also ordered to pay a fine of Rs.5000j- with a default term

of 6 months and he was ordered to paid Rs.25, 000 to the injured

person as compensation.

J f " j ! Considering the written submissions filed by both parties and

also evidence given at the trial court, it is evident that there has

been a sudden fight between the parties and that the deceased

person was also responsible for the incident.

Ms. Lakmali Karunanayake, Senior State Counsel informs court

that she is not objecting to the learned President's Counsel Mr.

Anil Silva's application to reduce the sentence given by the High

Court. Considering the evidence we decide to reduce the sentence

for the 1 st charge to five years rigours imprisonment and to

reduce the sentence for the 2nd charge to one year ngours

imprisonment. The fine and the compensation ordered will

remain as it is.

Subject to the above variations, the appeal is dismissed.
