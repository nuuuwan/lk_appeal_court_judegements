JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for both the Parties, when this case came up on 2017-09-

14 before this Court, agreed to have this case disposed of, by way of

written submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral . . . ' submissions. They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment

after considering the written submissions they had already filled.

Therefore, this judgment would be based on the material adduced by

parties in their pleadings and the written submissions.

At the outset learned counsel for the 1st Respondent - Respondent took up

two preliminary objections with regard to the maintainability of this appeal.

It would be prudent to deal with the said 2nd Preliminary objection first.

The said 2nd preliminary objection is that the Appellant in this case has no

right of appeal to prefer this appeal as he has never been a party to these

proceedings at any previous occasion.

It is a fact that the Appellant has not been a party to this case either at the

Magistrate's Court proceedings or at the High Court proceedings.

What the Appellant in this case is seeking to challenge is a settlement

entered into between the 1st Respondent - Respondent and the 2nd

Respondent - Respondent. The 2nd Respondent - Respondent who stood as

the accused in the case filed against him in the Magistrate's Court had

undertaken to pay a sum of money and hand over some vehicles along

with their documents to the 2nd Respondent - Respondent who was the

virtual Complainant in the case. It was upon the 2nd ReSpondent -

Respondent's complaint that the 3rd Respondent - Respondent (Special

Crimes Investigation Bureau - Nugegoda) had instituted this proceeding in

the Magistrate's Court. Thus, the Appellant has had no involvement in any

capacity in any of the transactions referred to in the proceedings in Court.

It could be further noted as admitted by learned counsel for all the parties

that the 1st Respondent - Respondent and 2nd Respondent - Respondent

did not represent the Appellant company although both of them had been

directors of the company at some given time.

The Appellant has failed to show to the satisfaction of this Court as to how

he becomes entitled to a right of appeal in the instant case.

In these circumstances, this Court has no basis to hold that the Appellant

in this case has a legitimate right of appeal to prefer the instant appeal.

Therefore, this Court upholds the 2nd preliminary objection raised by the

learned counsel for the 1st Respondent - Respondent that the Appellant has

no right of appeal in this case. Thus, he is not entitled to maintain this

appeal.

The 1st preliminary objection raised by the learned counsel for the 1st

Respondent - Respondent is that the Appellant has failed to make all

'necessary parties to this appeal. It has to be noted that Hon. Attorney

General was a party in this case at the High Court. Indeed he had been

made a party as it was a public official namely Officer in Charge of the

District Frauds Investigation Bureau Nugegoda who had instituted

proceedings in this case in the Magistrate's Court. However, the Appellant

has not made Hon. Attorney General a party to this proceeding.

In view of the finding with regard to the 2nd preliminary objection, it would

not be necessary for this Court to make a ruling on the 1st preliminary

objection referred to above.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with

costs payable by the Appellant to the 1st Respondent - Respondent and the

2nd Respondent - Respondent.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
