The accused appellant (hear in after referred to as the accused) in this case was indicted in the

High Court of Tangalle on the following charge:-

On or about 25th of May 1999 within the jurisdiction of this court in Tangalle, the accused did

commit the death of one Nambukara Dickwella Gamage Martin Singho which amounts to an

offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal Code.

After trial the learned high court Judge of Tangalle found the accused appellant guilty of the

Murder, sentenced him to death.

The prosecution case solely based on circumstantial evidence.

Facts of the case:-

PW1 N.D.G.Samantha who is the son of the deceased and the elder brother of the accused

appellant. According to prosecution witness No..!..Jbrother of the Accused), both the accused

and the deceased were living in the same house and on the day of the incident witness had

visited his father. At the time he left the house both of them were at home, but on the

following day he received a message about the death of his father.

Witness W.A.Patabendige Nilantha who was a neighbor has testified that on the day in

question, the accused had come to his mill around 7 p.m.,on his way home. He had

informed the witness that he would serve the deceased's dinner and return back.

Accordingly he had come back and slept till dawn in the mill. Following morning the

accused gone back to his house and returned immediately, intimating that the doors of

the house had been forcefully opened, at that point of time the witness also had

accompanied the accused to the place of crime.

The witness has testified that both the rear and front had been broken and he had seen

the deceased lying in bed when he looked through the window. It was his evidence that

he and the accused had a cordial relationship and the accused onJ!revious occasions too

had slept in his mill stating that he was lonely.

Medical evidence reveals that the death of the deceased was due to cranio cerebral

injuries due to blunt weapon trauma.

At the very outset of the argument learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General conceded

the fact that it is not safe to support the conviction of this case.

Considering available circumstantial evidence we are also of the view that conviction

cannot stand. Therefore we set aside the conviction and the death sentence imposed on

the accused appellant by the learned High Court Judge of Tangalle.

Hereby the appeal is allowed.
