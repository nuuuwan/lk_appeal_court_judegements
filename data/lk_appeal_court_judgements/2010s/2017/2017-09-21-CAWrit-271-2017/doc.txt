Decided on 20/09/2017

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

We have heard the Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioners in

support of this application and also the learned D.S.G. for the 15t and 2nd

Respondents.

The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner is seeking interim relief as

prayed for in prayer III and IV to the Petition.

In prayer III, the Petitioners are seeking to have a separate bank

account to credit all monies received, in terms of regulation 8(1), 7(2) and

Whilst admitting that there are other Port Junk Dealers "providing

reception facilities" it is observed that, the Petitioners have failed to satisfy 1

Court that if the interim relief sought for are refused or granted, it would

not only affect the Petitioners but also the dealers who are not members of

the 15t Petitioner Association who have similar interest. The Petitioners

have also failed to disclose the other Port Junk Dealers who are directly

affected.

When granting interim relief the Court necessarily should take into

consideration not only the interest of the members of the 15t Petitioner

Association but also the existence and interest of such other dealers who arc

engaged in "providing reception facilities" whose interests may be affected

due to the non disclosure.

We are of the view that sufficient interest of the Petitioner to bring

this petition and the substantive relief prayed for in respect of the

regulations made by the Minister exercising his statutory powers are

matters to be decided at the hearing taking into consideration the full legal

and factual background to this action.

Under these circumstances we refuse to Issue the interim orders

prayed for.
