Vijith K Malalgoda PC. J.(P/CA)

Learned President's Counsel appearing for the petitioner before this

Court supports against the respondents for acting in violation of a stay

order said to have issued by the Civil Appellate High Court of Colombo and

the said order is produced before this Court at page 286. According to the

said order, the Civil Appellate High Court had made the said order on

27.05.2013 until the final determination of the said case. As revealed before

this Court, the final determination of this case was made in the year 2016

and said proceedings are also available in this brief in page 383 and as

observed by Court, the said order was not in favour of the petitioners but

was in favour of the respondents. However, the petitioner whilst relying on

the fiscal order marked PI submits that the possession of the premises in

concerned was handed over to the respondents by the fiscal on 22.02.2014

in contrary to the stay order given by the Civil Appellate High Court and

therefore submits that the said act by the respondents was in contempt to

the order made by the Civil Appellate High Court of the Western Province.

However, when going through the said document PI we observe that the

1

,

fiscal when visited the said premises had questioned the 1 st petitioner who

was present to the premises and at that time the petitioner had brought to

the notice of this Court that there is a stay order in operation but however

the petitioner has failed to satisfy the fiscal of the utterances he made by

submitting any documents to prove to the effect that there is a stay order in

operation at that time. At the same time the possession was handed over to

the respondents on 22.02.2014 and going through the papers filed before

this Court and considering the submissions made by the learned

President's Counsel, we observe that the petitioners since that date had not

taken any steps at least to complain of the said conduct of the respondents

before the same Court that is the Civil Appellate Court of the Western

Province until they come before this Court today after three years of the said

Act.

In the said circumstances this Court is not inclined at this stage to act

under the provisions of the Article 105 of the Constitution and to issue

summons on the respondents. Application is accordingly dismissed but we

make no order with regard to costs.

PRESIDENT OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

I agree.
