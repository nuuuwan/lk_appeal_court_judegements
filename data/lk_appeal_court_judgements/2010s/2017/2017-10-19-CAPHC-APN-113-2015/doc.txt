JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for all the Parties, when this case came up on 2017-08-01

before us, agreed to have this case disposed of, by way of written

submissions. Therefore, this judgment would be based on the material that

the parties have so adduced before this Court.

Hon. Attorney General had indicted the Accused Respondent in this case in

the High Court of Anuradhapura alleging that he, on or about 2011-09-27,

at Dutuwewa, had committed the murder of one Abesinghage Thakshila

Mihirani Abeysinghe, an offence punishable under section 296 of the Penal

Code.

The Accused Respondent, upon the charge in the indictment being read

over and explained to him, had pleaded not guilty to the charge. The trial

4

had then begun on 2015-02-23. Thereafter during the said trial, the

Accused Respondent having moved to withdraw the plea of not guilty,

which he had earlier tendered, had opted to plead guilty to a lesser charge

of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable under section

297 of the Penal Code,.

Learned High Court Judge had then recorded his plea of guilty, permitting

him to withdraw his previous plea of not guilty and had convicted the

Accused Respondent for an offence punishable under section 297 of the

Penal Code. Having proceeded to hear the submissions of learned counsel

for both parties on the question of the quantum of sentence, learned High

Court Judge had imposed a term of 08 years RI and a fine of Rs. 500/=

along with a default sentence of 01 week imprisonment on the Accused

Respondent.

It is this sentence that the Aggrieved Party Petitioner seeks to enhance

through this revision application. It is his prayer in this application that this

Court should pass a reasonable and adequate sentence on the Accused

Respondent considering the facts and circumstances of this case.

5

Thus, the task before this court in this case is to ascertain whether there

are any grounds to allow such an application.

It must be noted that the following grounds have been considered by the

learned High Court Judge when deciding the quantum of sentence;

I. that the Accused Respondent was convicted for an offence

punishable under section 297 of the Penal Code on the basis of

grave and sudden provocation

II. that the deceased was the wife of the Accused Respondent;

III. that the Accused Respondent was 25 years of age;

IV. that the Accused Respondent had no previous convictions,

V. that the Accused Respondent had chosen to plead guilty,

Learned Deputy Solicitor General stated that she would abide by any order

that this Court would make in this regard.

Perusal of the order made by the learned High Court Judge shows to the

satisfaction of this Court that he had carefully considered all aspects he

ought to have considered before passing the sentence. This Court cannot

find any basis to deviate from the course of action that was adopted by

him in this case.

6

In these circumstances this Court is of the view that it has no basis to

interfere with the sentence imposed by the learned High Court Judge.

Thus, this Court decides to refuse this application. It should stand

dismissed.

We make no order for costs.

Application is dismissed.
