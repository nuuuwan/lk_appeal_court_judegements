The case for the prosecution was closed after marking Documents P1, P2and X. There after

all the Accused Appellants gave doc statements. At the conclusion of the trial the Learned

High Court Judge of Kalutara convicted all the Accused Appellants as follows:-

Charbe 1:- 6 months RI

Charge 2:- Death Sentence

Charge 3:- 18 months RI

Charge 4 and 5:- No sentences were imposed as those charges were alternative charges.

All the Accused Appellants aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence imposed by the

Learned High Court Judge of Kalutara have invoked the Appellant Jurisdiction of this Court

to set aside the same.

The learned Counsel for the Appellants rose following grounds of Appeal:-

(1.) The Learned Trial Judge has failed to properly asses that the evidence of witnesses

PW1 ana PW2 lacks credibility.(lnterse and perse controdictions)

(2.) The learned Trial Judge has not considered the fact that the history given to the

doctor by PW2 totally contradicts the evidence given at the trial.

(3.) The Learned Trial Judge has failed to consider that dock identification is bad in law

IS there is no proper identification in this case.

4

(4.) The Learned Trial Judge has erred in law by convicting the Appellants under the

Charge of unlawful assembly

Facts of the prosecution cas in brief:-

According to Prosecution witness No.1, on 16th November 2013, the witness was woken up

early morning as it was the time period that the Islamic faith conducts ritualistic fasting. She

had sent her step brother (PW2) to the nearby shop and proceeded to cook. After about twenty

minutes she had heard a person yelling and had come out to inquire. When she was running

towards the direction which she had heard the screaming, she had stepped on a person. Then

she had immediately checked and noticed the deceased (Rizmi) lying on the ground with

bleeding multiple injuries. When she inquired as to who assaulted the ir.jured he was unable to

speak since his mouth was full of blood. She had screamed for help. There were about 5 people

but she was unable to identify them. When she was taking the deceased to the hospital by a

three wheeler he was able to speak and mentioned names of 5 people including 1st 3rd and 4th

Appellants. He had mentioned names Haris, Rizmi, Rased, Rizvan, Liyakanth. After admission he

was taken to the operation theatre of Nagoda hospital and there after he was pronounced

dead. Her injured brother(PW2) was transferred to Colombo.

According to her evidence the deceased and the Appellants (Accused) were known to each

other. Earlier her niece had met with an accident with a motor cycle belonged to the 1st

accused's nephew. The police had taken steps to mediate the issue but the but the animosity

had not completely faded away, which forms the motive for the commission of the crime.PW1

had seen the accused at the scene and that fact had not challenged in the cross examination.

Since the omission had not been demonstrated, it enhances the credibility of the witness. In

the case of Himal Chandh Pradesh Vs Thakur Das (1983) 2 Cri. U 1694 at page 107, it was held

5

II

l [ \

that whenever a statement made by a witness is not challenged in cross examination it has to

be concluded that the fact in question is not disputed.

Also in the case of Tissera Vs AG , CA 87/2005 it was held that whenever evidence given by a

witness on a material point is not challenged in cross examination, it has to be concluded that

such evidence is not disputed and is accepted by the opponent subjected of course to the

qualifications that the witness is a reliable witness.

It is apparent that the Accused Appellants were well-known to the prosecution witnesses and

therefore there is no need to hold an identification parade. Therefore no prejudice has caused

to the Accused Appellants.

According to the injured PW2, when he went to the nearby boutique to purchase bananas, he

witnessed the accused assaulting the deceased. When he inquired the reason for the assault,

from the 1st Accused, he had threatened the witness with death. Further said that since himself

was assaulted, he was about to kill Rizmi then and there. Liyakanth (1st Accused) was armed

with a 'manna knife'. When he pleaded them not to assault severely, the 1st Accused had

assaulted him with a knife. He mentioned that both the 1st and the 3rd Accused were carrying

knifes and the rest of the Accused were carrying clubs. Although it was generally dark, the

incident had taken place near a lamp post.

In the case of Sigera Vs AG 20111 SLR 201, it was held that an Appellant Court will not interfere

with the findings of facts of a trial judge who has the privilege and the advantage of hearing and

observing the demeanour and deportment of witnesses as and when they gave evidence in

court.

In AG Vs Potta Naufer & others SC 1/2006 it was held that when faced with contradictions in a

testimonial of a witness, the court must bear in mind the nature and significance of the

contradictions. The court must come to a determination regarding whether the contradiction

was an honest mistake on the part of the witness or whether it was a deliberate attempt to

mislead the court.

The doc statements of the Accused do not cast any doubt in the evidence given by the

prosecution witnesses as per the rule set out in the case of Queen Vs Kularatne 71 NLR 529.

The short story given to the doctor cannot be treated as substantial evidence, as per section

110 of the Criminal Procedure Code. It was observed by the learned trial judge that one witness

referred to one 'Yakamahatthaya' and it was a typing error.

In the light of above mentioned evidence it is clear that the prosecution had proved the

guilt of the accused appellants beyond reasonable doubt and that the learned trial judge

had come to the correct finding.

Therefore, the learned trial judge had not made any errors that caused prejudice to the

accused appellants.

Considering above, we see no reason to interfere with the finding of the Learned High

Court Judge. Hence the conviction and the sentence affirmed.

Appeal is hereby dismissed.
