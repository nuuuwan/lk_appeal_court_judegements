JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for both Parties, when this case came up before us on

2017-07-11, agreed to have this case disposed of, by way of written

submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral submissions.

They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment after

considering the written submissions they had already filed. Therefore, this

judgment would be based on the material adduced by parties in their

pleadings and the contents of their written submissions.

The Complainant - Respondent - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Appellant) had instituted this case against the

IIII

4

Respondent - Petitioner - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Respondent) in the Magistrate's Court of Udugama under section

66 (1) (b) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act, as a private information.

The Appellant had sought an order declaring that he be entitled to have

the possession of the impugned land.

Learned Magistrate having inquired into this complaint, pronounced his

order dated 2004-01-29, holding that the Appellant is entitled to have the

possession of the land, which is the subject matter of the dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the

Respondent had filed an application for revision in the Provincial High Court

of Southern Province holden in Galle seeking a revision of the order made

by the learned Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, revised the said order

made by the learned Magistrate on the basis that existence of a breach of

peace had not been established before the learned Magistrate could

proceed to inquire in to the said case.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has appealed to this Court.

5

It would be helpful, at the outset, to refer to the case of Kanagasabai V

Mylvaganam.1 It is a case under section 62 of the Administration of justice

law, which had conferred special jurisdiction on the Magistrate to make

orders to prevent a dispute affecting lands causing a breach of peace. It

has been held in that case that the said section requires the Magistrate to

be first satisfied before initiating the proceedings, that a dispute affecting

lands exists and that such a dispute is likely to cause a breach of peace.

In this regard the following passage from a judgment of this Court in the

case of Punchi Nona V Padumasena and others2 would also be relevant. It

is as follows;

" ... The jurisdiction conferred on a primary Court under section 66 is a

special jurisdiction. It is a quasi - criminal jurisdiction. The primary object

of the jurisdiction so conferred is the prevention of a breach of the peace

. arising in respect of a dispute affecting lan~. The Court in exercising this

jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation into title or the right to

possession which is the function of a civil Court. He is required to take

action of a preventive and provisional nature pending final adjudication of

rights in a civil Court. It was therefore incumbent upon the Primary Court

judge to have initially satisfied himself as to whether there was a threat or

likelihood of a breach of peace and whether he was justified in assuming

such a special jurisdiction under the circumstances. The failure of the judge

to satisfy himself initially in regard to the threat or likelihood of the breach

of peace deprived him of the jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry and

this vitiates the subsequent proceedings .... "

The Appellant has made his first statement to police on 2003-01-25. He

had stated that the Respondent along with few others were preparing the

land to put up a house in the impugned land. He had however not

complained any breach of peace in that statement. The Appellant had

thereafter (on 2003-01-27), had made yet another statement to Police. He

had stated in that statement that two unidentified persons threatened him

to withdraw the complaint he had earlier made. However he had

categorically stated that he does not wish the Police to proceed to Inquire

into his complaint.

In the light of the material including the above facts, adduced before

Court, this Court is unable to find any basis to interfere with the

7

conclusions arrived at by the learned Provincial High Court Judge that

breach of peace has not been established.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to dismiss this application

without costs.
