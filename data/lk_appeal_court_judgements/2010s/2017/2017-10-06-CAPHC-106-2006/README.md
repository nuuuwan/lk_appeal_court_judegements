JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for all the Parties when this case came up on 2017-07-04

before us, agreed to have this case disposed by way of written

submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral submissions.

They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment after

considering the written submissions they would file. Therefore, this

judgment is based on the material that has been adduced by parties in

their pleadings and the written submissions.

The Petitioner- Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province holden at Panadura praying for a writ of Certiorari to

quash the decision dated 1999-09-11 of the 2nd Respondent Respondent

4

(who is hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the 2nd Respondent

or Arbitrator). The said decision is an award made pursuant to an

arbitration conducted by him.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge had refused to issue a writ of

certiorari and had proceeded to dismiss the application, as there had been

no ground for such a writ.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this

Court.

Learned counsel for the Appellant has agreed to be content by filing

written submissions to set out his complaint before this Court. He has

indeed filed the written submissions as undertaken.

Although he has taken up certain grounds to argue as to why the Provincial

High Court should have issued the writ sought for, he has failed to satisfy

the Court that such grounds indeed exist to the satisfaction of this Court.

Further, it appears that the Appellant admittedly had exhausted his rights

of appeal and it was thereafter that he had thought of canvassing the

same decision by way of a writ of certiorari.

5

Perusal of the application filed in the Provincial High Court shows clearly

that the Appellant had filed the said application on 2001-02-23 requesting

the Court to quash a decision taken on 1999-09-11. Thus, the Appellant is

clearly guilty of laches.

In these circumstances, the refusal to grant a writ of certiorari by the

Provincial High Court is justifiable. This Court sees no basis to interfere

with the said finding. Therefore, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal

with costs.

Appeal dismissed with costs.
