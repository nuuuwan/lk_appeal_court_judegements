JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The 1st Petitioner is the mother of the 2nd Petitioner who is a minor and

whose admission to Grade 1 of Drarmashoka College Ambalangoda, was

sought by an application made by the 1st Petitioner to the said school.

Upon this application being rejected by the School, the 1st Petitioner

appealed to the Appeal Panel appOinted by the School authorities. This

appeal too had been rejected.

The Petitioner had applied for admission under the Past Pupil category. It

can be seen that 2 marks is awarded for the each year that the applicant

had spent at the school as a past pupil. As the Petitioner having joined the

school from grade 6 had been awarded 10 marks for the total no. of years

at the school.

Complaints made to this Court by the Petitioner in this proceeding are;

1. that it was not due to her fault that she had to join the school from

grade 6 but the fact that there were no grade 1 classes at the school

~

due to a policy decision taken by the Ministry of Education when she

started her grade1 classes.

II. that she could have very well joined the school from grade 1 had

there been such classes in the year she started her grade 1 class.

III. that she was unable to earn more marks for the extracurricular

activities done whilst at the school because of a disability she had

suffered;

IV. that the circular P 2 failed to provide for a scheme for the benefit of

parents with disabilities;

In challenging the non-selection of the 2nd Petitioner to the school, it is the

argument of the Petitioners that the reason assigned thereto that the

Petitioners had not fulfilled the required qualifications for admission of

children as per the circular No. 2011/18, is not justifiable.

It is in this backdrop that the Petitioners in their petition have prayed inter

alia for,

I. a Writ of Certiorari to quash the circular No. 2012/19 produced

marked P 2 and the marking scheme produced marked P 6 ;

II. a Writ of Mandamus to compel the 1st_4th Respondents to admit the

2nd Petitioner to Grade One class of Dharmashoka College

Ambalangoda.

It must be noted at the outset that the circular, the Petitioner seeks to

quash is the circular applicable island wide for admission of students to

Grade 1 of the Government Schools. It is not a circular limited only to this

school.

Since this court at this instance is dealing with an application for mandates

in the nature of Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus in terms of Article 140 of

the Constitution, the task before this court is only to ascertain whether

there is any ground for the issuance of such writs against the respondent

school authorities.

It must also be borne in mind that the Petitioners complaint is that the

rejection of her application by the school authorities is wrong because of

the lapses in the circular marked P 2 issued by the Ministry of Education.

As has been indicated above, the task before this court in this case is only

to verify whether respondent school authorities have acted within their

powers. In the light of this background it must be borne in mind, as

I i ;

i I I

\

revealed before this Court that it is the same method and the yardsticks

that the respondent school authorities have adopted to evaluate the

applications of all applicants for the selection of students to its classes in

Grade 1.

I i In these circumstances it is clear that the action of the respondent school j

authorities in rejecting the said application submitted by the petitioner

cannot be termed ultra vires.

As regards the appeal proceedings by the Appeal Panel, they are also

bound by the same circular. Therefore they too cannot deviate from it.

Thus, their action is also not ultra vires.

In the case of Mohammed Uzman Nazeem Vs Upali Gunasekara, Principal

Royal College and 2 others1, the Supreme Court agreed with the view that

additional documents should not be considered since the selection of

students were made on the basis of documents furnished at the interview2

Thus, the Respondent school authorities are entitled to reject the

application submitted by the 1st Petitioner as she had not obtained

sufficient marks to compete with the other applicants who also had applied

under the same circular being bound by the same conditions.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we see no basis as to

why the aforesaid writs applied for by the Petitioner should be issued. (I

Hence we decide to dismiss this application. However, we make no order

for costs.

Application is dismissed without costs.
