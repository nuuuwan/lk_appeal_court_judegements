The plaintiff instituted action in the District Court of Embilipitiya and claimed that the land fully

described in Schedule A of the amended plaint was given to him on a permit on 19.01.1985. The

plaintiff stated that on or about 04.06.1989 the defendant had evicted him from a portion of the

said land, fully described in Schedule B thereto, and was obstructing to his title and possession

1

t

thereto. The plaintiff prayed for a declaration of title, ejectment of the defendant from part of

the land claimed by the plaintiff and for damages.

The defendant denied title of the plaintiff and claimed that the land fully described in the

Schedule of the amended answer was given to him on a permit by the State which antedated the

permit given to the plaintiff. The defendant counterclaimed for a declaration of title to the said

land.

After trial, the learned District Judge held that the permit issued to the defendant was not a valid

permit as it has not been extended after 3pt December 1983 and that the defendant is not

entitled to a declaration of title based on it. He further held that a declaration of title cannot be

obtained to land received from the State on an annual permit. However, the learned District

Judge states that the permit issued to the plaintiff is of a permanent nature although it is referred

to as an annual permit and therefore held that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of title to

the corpus. Accordingly, by judgment dated 28.05.1997, delivered on 11.06.1997, he granted the

relief claimed by the plaintiff and dismissed the counterclaim of the defendant. Hence the

present appeal to this court by the defendant.

Although parties inter alia made submissions on the identity of the two lands and the findings of

the learned District Judge on this issue, I am of the view that it is unnecessary to go into those

matters as this appeal can be disposed of on a more fundamental issue. It arises from the fact

that both parties seek declaration of title to lands given in terms of permits issued under the

State Lands Ordinance.

The fundamental issue is whether a declaration of title can be claimed by a person to state land

given to him in terms of a permit issued under the State Lands Ordinance. The plaintiff relied on

the decisions in Palisena v. Perera1 and Bandaranayake v. Karunawathie2 to support the

proposition that a holder of a permit under the Land Development Ordinance can maintain a rei

vindicatio action against a trespasser. The defendant also relied on the decision in Palisena v.

Perera3 to support his counterclaim for a declaration of title. The questions that arise for

consideration are whether the plaintiff's action is a rei vindicatio action and whether Palisena v.

Perera4 and Bandaranayake v. KarunawathieS are authority to maintain an action for declaration

of title to state land given to a person in terms of a permit issued under the State Lands

Ordinance.

From the right of ownership springs the vindication of a thing, that is to say, an action in rem by

which we sue for a thing which is ours but in possession of another6 Marsoof J. in Latheef v.

Mansoor7 sought to explain the origins of the actio rei vindicatio and its contemporary expression as

follows:

"Clearly, the action for declaration of title is the modern manifestation of the ancient vindicatory

action (vindicatio rei), which had its origins in Roman Law. The actio rei vindicatio is essentially

an action in rem for the recovery of property, as opposed to a mere action in personam,

founded on a contract or other obligation and directed against the defendant or

defendants personally, wherein it is sought to enforce a mere personal right (in

personam), The vindicatio form of action had its origin in the legis actio procedure which

symbolized the claiming of a corporeal thing (res) as property by laying the hand on it,

and by using solemn words, together with the touching of the thing with the spear or

wand, showing how distinctly the early Romans had conceived the idea of individual

ownership of property. As Johannes Voet explains in his Commentary on the Pandects

(G.!.1) "to vindicate is typically to claim for oneself a right in reo All actions in rem are

called vindications, as opposed to personal actions or conductions.""

The plaintiff has asserted ownership to the land fully described in Schedule A to the amended

plaint and contends that the defendant is in unlawful occupation of part of it more fully described

in Schedule B thereto. The plaintiff's claim to be restored to possession is based on his claim to

ownership of the land in issue. This clearly indicates that the plaintiff's action is an actio rei

vindicatio. It is not a possessory action as provided for in Section 4 of the Prescription Ordinance.

The plaintiff has further prayed for a declaration of title to the land described in Schedule A of

the amended plaint. This does not change the character of the plaintiff's action from a rei

vindicatio action. A decree for declaration of title may, of course, be obtained by way of

additional relief in a rei vindicatio action proper8. In any event the affinity between the action

for declaration of title and an action rei vindicatio has been considered in several landmark

decisions in Sri Lanka and South Africa, which seem to suggest that they are both essentially

actions for the assertion of ownership, and that the differences that have been noted in decisions

such as Le Mesurier v. Attorney General are differences without any real distinction9.

The next question is whether the decisions in Palisena v. Perera lO and Bandaranayake v.

Karunawathiell supports the case of the plaintiff to maintain an action for declaration of title to

the land given to him under a permit issued in terms of the State Lands Ordinance.

The permit granted to the plaintiff in this case was marked during the trial as "Pl". It has been

issued under the State Lands Ordinance permitting the permit holder to occupy the relevant state

land. It does not transfer title of the State to the permit holder. The learned District Judge has

erred in finding that the permit issued to the plaintiff is of a permanent nature although it is

referred to as an annual permit. The provisions in clauses 6, 8, 10, 11 and 12 of "P1" clearly

establishes that no title was transferred.

In a long line of cases Sri Lankan courts have consistently held that ownership of the property

claimed in a rei vindicatio action is a fundamental condition to its maintainability.

As Macdonell C.J. stated in De Silva v. Goonetilleke12 :

liTo bring the action rei vindicatio plaintiff must have ownership actually vested in him".

(Nathan p. 362, s. 593.) ... The authorities unite in holding that plaintiff must show title to

the corpus in dispute and that if he cannot, the action will not lie."

In Pathirana v. Jayasundera13 Gratiaen J. stated the principle as follows:

"In a rei vindicatio action proper the owner of immovable property is entitled, on proof

of title, to a decree in his favour for the recovery of the property and for ejectment of the

person in wrongful occupation. liThe plaintiff's ownership of the thing is of the very

essence of the action." Maasdorp's Institutes (7th Ed.) Vol. 2,96"

In Mansil v. Devaya14 G.P.S. De Silva J. stated thus:

"In a rei vindication action, ... , ownership is of the essence of the action; the action is

founded on ownership."

In Latheef v. Mansoor15 Marsoof J. held that:

"An important feature of the actio rei vindicatio is that it has to necessarily fail if the

plaintiff cannot clearly establish his title"

In view of these unequivocal pronouncements it is clear that the plaintiff cannot maintain the

action as he has no title to the corpus. I will now consider the two authorities relied on by the

plaintiff in support of his action.

The plaintiff in Palisena v. Perera16 was a permit holder under the Land Development Ordinance.

He sued the defendant, whom he alleged to be a trespasser, for ejectment and consequential

relief. Gratiaen J. characterized the action as "a vindicatory action in which a person claims to be

entitled to exclusive enjoyment of the land in dispute, and asks that, on proof of that title, he be

placed in possession against an alleged trespasser." 17 There is no indication that the plaintiff in

that case sought a declaration of title as the plaintiff in this case seeks to do. I am therefore of

the view that the ratio decidendi in Palisena v. Perera18 does not enable the plaintiff in this case

to maintain an action for declaration of title to the land given to him under a permit issued in

terms of the State Lands Ordinance. In any event, the Court of Appeal in Attanayake v. Aladin19

considered the decision in Palisena v. Perera20 and Weerasekera J. stated that:

"clearly therefore what was decided by Gratiaen J. was that in a vindicatory action the

relief of ejectment would only be the consequent to a declaration or vindication of the

right to possess."21

The other case cited by the plaintiff is Bandaranayake v. Karunawathie22 where the plaintiff

sought a declaration that she is the lawful permit-holder to the land described in the schedule to

the plaint, ejectment of the defendant and all under him from the said land and restoration of

possession thereof and damages. Here again there was no declaration of title sought to the land

given under a permit issued under the Land Development Ordinance. Instead the plaintiff only

sought a declaration that she is the lawful permit-holder to the land described in the schedule to

the plaint. I am therefore of the view that the ratio decidendi in Bandaranayake v.

Karunawathie23 does not permit the plaintiff in this case to maintain an action for declaration of

title to the land given to him under a permit issued in terms of the State Lands Ordinance. In any

event, it does not appear that the Court appraised the decision in Attanayake v. Aladin 24 and the

long line of cases requiring ownership of the property in a rei vindicatio action as a fundamental

condition to its maintainability.

In a rei vindicatio action the burden is on the plaintiff to establish the title pleaded and relied on

by him. In Dharmadasa v. Jayasena25 the grant relied on by the plaintiff was held to be invalid

and it was held by the Supreme Court that therefore the plaintiff had failed to establish title. In

a rei vindicatio action it is not necessary to consider whether the defendant has any title or right

to posseSSion, where the plaintiff has failed to establish his title to the land sought to be

vindicated, the action ought to be dismissed without more26 As observed earlier the permit

issued to the plaintiff does not convey any title to the plaintiff. The learned District Judge erred

in holding that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of title to the corpus. Therefore, the

judgment of the learned District Judge in granting the plaintiff a declaration of title must be set

aside.

The learned District Judge has found that the defendant is occupying part of the land given to the

plaintiff in terms of permit marked "P!". The only remaining question is whether the plaintiff is

entitled to an ejectment of the defendant from the said portion of land though not entitled to a

declaration of title. As I have stated earlier the plaintiff's action is not a possessory action. He

seeks to eject the defendant on the strength of the declaration of title he has sought in the action.

He is not entitled to it for the reasons explained above. In the circumstances he is not entitled to

an ejectment of the defendant for if such an order is made it will convert a rei vindicatio action

into a possessory action. Furthermore in Attanayake v. Aladin27 Weerasekera J. further held that:

"In this case the plaintiff-appellant whilst only stating that he came to possess on the

permit under the Land Development Ordinance did not seek a declaration from Court that

he was entitled to possess the land in dispute on the alleged yearly permit issued under

the Land Development Ordinance. The consequential relief of the ejectment of the

alleged trespasser cannot therefore arise." 28

For the reasons aforesaid I allow this appeal and set aside the judgment of the learned District

Judge of Embilipitiya dated 28.05.1997. I make further order dismissing the action of the plaintiff.

The defendant counterclaimed title to the portion of land occupied by him on the basis of a

permit issued to him under the State Lands Ordinance. Clause 1 of the permit clearly states that

it will end on 31st December 1983. There is no evidence that it was extended thereafter. Assuming

it was, it is yet on the same status as the plaintiff's permit. The provisions in clauses 6, 8, 10, 11

and 12 of "V1" clearly establishes that no title was transferred. Accordingly, for the reasons set

out above I dismiss the counterclaim of the defendant.

I make no order as to costs.
