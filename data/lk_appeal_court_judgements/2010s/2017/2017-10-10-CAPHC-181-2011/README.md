JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for the Respondent-Respondent-Respondents when this

case came up on 2017-07-04 before us, agreed to have this case disposed

by way of written submissions. This agreement had been recorded on

2017-05-08 also. Therefore, this judgment would be based on the material

adduced by parties in their pleadings and the contents of their written

submissions.

Perusal of the minutes in the docket shows that the Plaintiff Petitioner -

Petitioner - Appellant had been consistently absent in this Court. Although

this Court had taken steps to issue notices on him, he had not responded.

Minutes show that the Appellant had paid the brief fees. This shows that

he is aware of this appeal being pending in this Court. Thus, if he had

changed his address and if he was interested in prosecuting his appeal, he

should have taken steps to make his present address known to Court. He

had not done so. In these circumstances, this Court had proceeded to

dispose this appeal by considering the merits of this appeal.

The Plaintiff - Petitioner - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Appellant) had filed an information in the Magistrate's

Court of Nugegoda under section 66 (1) (b) as a private information.

Learned Magistrate having inquired into this complaint, by his order dated

2010-08-03, had held that the Court had already made certain orders

regarding the dispute complained of and that this dispute could be

adjudicated in the case pending in the District Court. Learned Magistrate

had refused the application on that basis.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant

had made a revision application in the Provincial High Court of Western

Province holden in Colombo urging the Provincial High Court to revise the

order of the learned Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, by its judgment dated

2011-10-18 had refused the said application for revision and proceeded to

dismiss it with costs. The Provincial High Court has taken the view that

there is no ground to interfere with the learned Magistrate's order.

proceed to dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
