L. T.D. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from the High Court of the North Central Province

holden at Anuradhapura.

The Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as

the Appellant) instituted this application in the Provincial High Court of

the North Central Province holden at Anuradhapura seeking for a

mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash a grant said to have

been issued in favour of the 3 rd and 4th Respondent Respondents

(hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Respondents) issued

under the Land Development Ordinance and a writ of mandamus to

compel the Respondents to issue the grant to the Appellant. The learned

High Court Judge, after inquiry, dismissed the application. Being

dissatisfied with the order, this appeal was presented to this Court.

Notice was issued to the Appellant on several occasions by this Court but

was absent and unrepresented at the argument. The notice sent to the

Appellant was not returned undelivered. Further the Appellant has

obtained the appeal brief from this Court. But he did not take part in the

argument. The Respondents raised a preliminary objection on the

maintainability on the basis of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the

case of The Superintendent, Stafford Estate and others v. Solimuthu Rasu

S.C. Appeal No. 21113 dated 26th September 2013.

It was held in that case that the "State Land" is a reserved subject under

the 13th Amendment to the Constitution subject to the Provincial Council

list which does not include the alienation of the state land. It has been

held by Mohan Pieris PC CJ at page 16 of His Lordship's judgment that;

The provision once again emphasizes the overarching position

inherent in the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that State Land

4

will continue to vest in the Republic and may be disposed of by the

President in accordance with Article 33 (d) and written laws

governing the matter. The use of the definite article "the" before

the word State Land in this provision conclusively proves that the

state land referred to in this provision is confined to the land made

available to the Provincial Council for utilization for a Provincial

Council subject by virtue of 1.2. If after having made available to a

Provincial Council a state land for use, the government decides to

dispose of this land to a citizen or organization, the government

can take back the land but an element of advice has been

introduced to facilitate such alienation or disposition. In the same

way the Provincial Council too can initiate advice for the purpose

of persuading the government to alienate or dispose of the land

made available for a worthy cause. It has to be noted that the

absence of the word "only" before the word advice indicates the

non-binding nature of the advice the Provincial Council proffers.

Thus these inbuilt limitations on the part of the Provincial Council

establish beyond scintilla of doubt that the Centre continues to

have State Lands as its subject and it does not fall within the

province of Provincial Councils.

The High Court of Province is empowered to Issue prerogative writs

under the Article 154P 4 (b) of the Constitution only on the following

grounds. That is:

(a) There must be a person within the province who must have

exercised power under

(b) Any law or

(c) Any statute made by the Provincial Council

5

(d) In respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council List.

As I have pointed out, the "State Land" being a reserved subject, the

Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction to entertain an application of

this nature.

Accordingly, I dismiss the appeal.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

H.C.J. Madawala J.

I agree.
