This Revision Application has been filed to set aside the order of the

Learned High Court Judge of Kuliyapitiya dated 8/2/2016 and to

enlarge suspect on bail. The Accused Kalubowilage Nishantha Perera

was indicted in the High Court of Kuliyapitiya on the 12th August

2015 under section 380 and 383 read with section 32 of the Penal

Code. The Accused was totally unaware of this charge because the

police has not recorded any statement from the Accused of the

incident set out in the indictment and identification parade was held

on 28/7/2011 and one witness identified the Accused as the person

who pull out two rings from the witness having pointed a knife. The

witness had not mentioned in his statement to the police that such an

incident took place in the course of the main transaction.

On 10/1212015 when the Accused was brought to court the

indictment was served on him and the Accused was enlarged on bail

by the Learned High Court Judge in sum of Rs.25,0001-with two

sureties worth Rs.500,0001-each.

On 08/02/2016 the Learned High Court Judge cancelled the existing

order as the Accused had 13 previous convictions and pending cases.

Being aggrieved by the said order 08/02/2016 the Petitioner who is a

mother of the above Accused named Kalubowilage Nishantha Perera

moved that this court, be pleased to act in revision and set aside

thesaid order on the following exceptional grounds,

The Learned High Court Judge totally disregarded

the provision set out in the section 14, 16 and the

section 17 of the Bail Act.

When this matter came up for argument on 28/02/2017 the Learned

DSG V.Hettige Counsel for the Respondent raised a preliminary

objections as to the locus standi of the appeal. Both parties were

directed to file their written submissions and the order is due on

Written submissions has been submitted by the Respondent and the

Petitioner has failed to file his written submissions. The Learned DSG

appearing for the Respondent raised in the preliminary objections that

the Petitioner has no locus standi to maintain this revision application

as she is not the aggrieved party. A revision application can only be

maintain by the aggrieved party. We have perused the supporting

authority submitted by the Learned DSG for the Respondent.

Namely,

In the case ofSenatileke Vs. Attorney General and Another 98 3

SLR 290 His Lordship Justice F.N.D. Jayasuriya with his

Lordship Justice Kulatillake held that;

"The father of the Accused has no locus standi to maintain the

revision application."

In the case of Savarimuttu Loganathan Vs. Attorney General

CA(PHC)APN 37/2014 His Lordship Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya

was held that;

" ... .I hold that the mother of the Accused has no locus standi to

institute this revision application."

In the case of M.P. Piyseeli Vs. Attorney General CA(PHC)

18/2009 His Lordship Justice A. W. Abdus Salam it was held:

" .... that the mother of the Accused has no locus standi to prefer a

revision application on behalf of the son."

In the case of E.G Roshan Fernando Vs. Attorney General

CA(PHC) APN 101113 His Lordship Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya it

was held;

" .... Since he has no locus standi to make the original application,

this revision application fails."

Accordingly we hold that the mother of the Accused has no locus

standi to prefer this revision application on behalf of the son of the

Accused.

We see no reasons as to why we should interfere with the order of the

Learned High Court Judge. Accordingly we dismiss this Revision

Application with state costs ofRs.5000/-.
