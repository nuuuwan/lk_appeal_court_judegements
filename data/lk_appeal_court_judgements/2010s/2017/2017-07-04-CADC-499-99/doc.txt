This is a Rei - Vendicatio action filed by the Plaintiff-Appellant in the

District Court of Anuradhapura against the Defendants -Respondent seeking

the following reliefs inter alia;

1. A declaration that the Appellant is the owner of the premises

which was described in the third schedule to the Plaint.

2. for ejectment of the Respondents and all those holding under

them from the said premises.

In a Rei -Vendicatio action the cause of action is based on the sole

ground of violation of right of ownership to the land. In a Rei- Vindicatio

action the plaintiff claims as the owner of the land he has the dominum and

that land is in the unlawful possession of the defendant.

In this matter plaintiff-respondent stated his plaints interalia that the

land was belonged toll persons granted by crown and they had divided it

amicably and were in possession to the said lots and that the second schedule

belonged to one Uduma Aiysa, who was the plaintiff-appellant's

Grandfather. The said Uduma Aiysa transferred Y2 share of the land

described in the second schedule to Mohammedu Lebbe by deed No.96

dated 11.12.1996. The said Uduma Aiysa died without leaving a last will

for the balance half shares. By paternal inheritance the appellant's father

Omardeen possessed the same, on behalf of him and his co-owner siblings.

Omardeen died and his rights devolved on his only heir the plaintiff-

appellant who possessed and prescribed to it.

In this matter it is important to consider whether plaintiff-appellant

proved he has the dominum over the land morefully described in the

schedule of the plaint.

In this case of Gnaneswaryans others Vs. Kanapathipillai Thamu

and other BASL NEWS (5/5/2004 C.A. Appeal No.642/86 (F)) decided by

Shiranee Thilakawardena ,J. (PICA) and P.Wijeyaratne,J. allowing appeal

held" In the case of Muathusamy Vs. Seneviratne 321 CLW 91 it has been

specifically stated that in action for declaration of title it is for the plaintiff

to establish his tile to the land he claims and not for the defendant to show

that the plaintiff has no title. This was followed in the case of Peiris Vs.

4 I

f : I t

Savunhamy 54 NLR page.207 where it had been held in an action for

declaration of tile to land where the defendant is in possession of the land

in dispute, the burden is on the plaintiff to prove that he has the dominum.

However in this matter of Rei -V endicatio action the plaintiff-

appellant failed to prove that the land was possessed by the 11 persons and

according to the shares they had for over 10 years prescription. And also he

failed to prove that the plaintiff-appellant's grandfather originally possessed

his share for over 10 years. Therefore it is very clear plaintiff-appellant

failed to prove his title.

But the plaintiff s action is for a declaration of title alleging that the

defendant was disputing his rights as the owner. In such case when the title

is admitted the burden is on the defendant to establish the legality of her

possessIOn.

Here defendant - respondents led in evidence by two deeds which

were subsequently produced marked as V2 and V3 at the trial. This was a

new stance taken by the respondents after the closed plaintiff appellant's

case was closed. Which is somewhat materially different from that what

was alleged by them in answer. And also Defendant's failed to prove V2 and

V3 that the deeds have not been registered at the Land Registry. And also it

should be noted the interpretation of the term "Registered" according to the

Interpretation Ordinance is that "Registered used with the reference to a

document shall mean registered under the provisions of the law for the time

being applicable to the registration of such documents". Because of the

non - registration both deeds cannot claim legal binding.

In a Rei-Vindicatio action the plaintiff must proof and establish his

title. He cannot ask for a declaration of title in his favour merely on the

weakness of the Defednat's title. All these cases have been followed by the

case of Luwis Singho Vs. Ponnemperuma 1996 2 SRI L.R. Page 320.

Therefore plaintiff- appellant cannot ask for declaration on the strength of

the defendant's title which was not established.

In these circumstances I am of the view that the learned District Judge

has very carefully and correctly arrived at his determination with correct

perspective and analyzed the entire verbal and documentary evidences place

before him to come to his conclusion.

Therefore the appeal is dismissed with costs fix at Rs. 25,0001-.
