This is an application for Mandates III the nature of Writ of Certiorari and

Mandamus. The petitioner is an elected member of the Northern Provincial

Council. The first respondent is the Chief Minister and one to six are members of

the said Provincial Council. The seventh respondent is the Governor of the

Northern Province. I

The petitioner states that he was elected as a member of the Northern Provincial

Council and was appointed as a Minister of the Board of Ministers of the said

council. Among other things, the petitioner states that the first respondent has

removed him from the office of Minister and another member was appointed. The

petitioner's grievance is two-folded: one is that the first respondent has no legal

right to remove a minister from the Board of Ministers and the other is that the

decision to remove the petitioner is arbitrary, unreasonable, capricious, in breach

of the petitioner's legitimate expectations and motivated by Mala fides. The

petitioner is seeking for notice and interim order preventing the removal.

Under the Rule 46 of Rules of the Supreme Court 1978 "every application made to

the Court of Appealfor the exercise of the powers vested in the Court of Appeal by

Article 140 and 141 of the Constitution shall be by way of petition and affidavit in

support of the averments set out in the petition and shall be accompanied by

originals of documents material to the case or duly certified copies thereof, in the

form of exhibits . ..... " It has been held in the case of Brown & Co. Ltd. and another

V. Ratnayake, Arbitrator and others [1994] 3 Sri L R 91 that it is mandatory to

adhere to the rules.

Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1978 requires the petition to be

supported by affidavit and to be accompanied by original or duly certified

copies of documents material to the case in the form of exhibits. The burden

of presenting a proper application is on the party that seeks the intervention

of the Court. The procedure is specified for this threshold stage. The Rule

regulates the mode of enforcing a legal right. The petitioner has to tender all

relevant material to the Court in order to invoke its jurisdiction. If he fails to

do this there is a failure to comply with a substantial aspect of the Rule.

In the case of Kumarasiri And Another Vs. Rajapakse [2006] 1 Sri L R 359 the

requirement of filing an affidavit with a revision application has been considered.

In that case the affidavit was held to be defective for the reason that the jurat was

incorrect. Somawansa J held in that case that;

(i) On an examination of the' affidavit, it is clear that the jurat therein is not

in conformity with the law. It is rather confusing and incorrectly worded; it

does not state where the affidavit was affirmed.

Per Somawansa J., (PICA)

"It is to be seen that, it is the flesh and blood of the affidavit which gives life

to the skeleton in the petition. "

Unless the facts contained in the petition are supported by the affidavit, the petition

cannot stand alone. In the present case the petitioner filed a document perpeted to

be an affidavit. The document was signed by the petitioner and a Commissioner for

Oaths. There is no proper jurat in the affidavit.

Under section 12 of the Oath and Affirmation Ordinance a Commissioner For Oath

is empowered to administer the Oath or Affirmation. He has to certify that the oath

or affirmation was administered by him. the section reads thus

(1) The Minister of Justice may from time to time appoint fit and proper

persons to be Commissioners for Oaths.

(2) A Commissioner for Oaths appointed under this Ordinance may

administer any oath or affirmation or take any affidavit for the purpose of

any legal proceedings or otherwise in all cases in which a Justice of the

Peace is authorized by law so to do, and in all cases in which an oath,

affirmation, or affidavit is commonly administered or taken before a Justice

,

of the Peace; and any oath or affirmation or affidavit administered or taken

by a Commissioner for Oaths shall in all legal proceedings and for all other

purposes have the same effect as an oath, affirmation, or affidavit

administered or taken before a Justice of the Peace; and all enactments

relating to oaths, affirmations, and affidavits administered or taken before a

Justice of the Peace shall, with the necessary modifications, apply thereto:

Provided that a Commissioner for Oaths shall not exercise the powers given

by this section in any proceeding or matter in which he is attorney-at law to

any of the parties, or in which he is otherwise interested.

(3) Every Commissioner before whom any oath or affirmation is

administered, or before whom any affidavit is taken under this Ordinance,

shall state truly in the jurat or attestation at what place and on what date the

same was administered or taken, and shall initial all alterations, erasures,

and interlineations appearing on the face thereof and made before the same

was so administered or taken.

The jurat in this affidavit in this case reads thus:

Sworn and signed at Colombo

On this day 29 of August 2017

The Commissioner for Oaths has failed to confirm whether the document was

signed before him or the oath/affirmation was administered by him or his

presences. Unless it was sworn and signed before the Commissioner for Oaths, it is

not a valid affidavit. Therefore this document cannot be considered as a valid

affidavit. If the affidavit is not valid the application has to be failed inlimine.

Under the Aritcle154 F (5) of the Constitution, the Board of Ministers of a

Provincial Council has to be appointed by the Governor as instructed by the Chief

tI

Minister. At the inception the petitioner was so appointed. Petitioner's contention

is that the Chief Minister cannot remove a Minister from the said the Board of

Ministers. The first respondent by the letter marked P12 informed the petitioner

that he has decided to remove the petitioner from the ministerial portfolio. The

petitioner is seeking to quash the said letter by a Writ of Certiorari. There is no

order containing in the document P12. This is only a communication of the 1st

Respondent's intention to the petitioner. Therefore this document is not amenable

to the Writ judiction.

The Board of Ministers were appointed by the ruling party of the Provincial

Council. Appointing the Ministers is a political act. The ruling party should be able

to change its Board of Ministers as and when necessary. If a reshuffle of Ministers

become necessary the Chief Minister can instruct the Governor to do so. Once the

new Ministers are appointed, the former Ministers automatically cease to hold

office.

These appointments being political appointments, the rules of the administrative

law do not apply.

Under these circumstances, I refwie notice and dismiss the application.
