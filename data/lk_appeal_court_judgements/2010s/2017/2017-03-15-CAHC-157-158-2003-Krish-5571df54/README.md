Four accused along with the accused-appellant to the present appeal Krishnasami Ramachandran were

indicted before the High Court of Kandy with regard to an explosion and attack took place on

25.01.1998 at the most venerable, Temple of Tooth relic Kandy. The indictment served on the accused

contained 149 counts under the Emergency Regulation for,

1. Causing mischief to the Temple of Tooth relic by exploding an explosive device

and in the said process,

2. Causing the death of 15 persons and

3. Causing injuries to several people whose names appeared in the indictment, who were in and

around the Temple of Tooth relic at the time the incident took place.

As revealed before this court, the trial against the 1st accused to the indictment Subramaniam

Ravindran had proceeded in absentia and the trial against the other three accused namely Muthulingam

Sivarajah (2od accused) Muthusamy Pillai Dharmalingam (3rd accused) and Krishnasami

Ramachandran (4th accused) proceeded before the High Court Judge upon them pleading not guilty to

the indictment against them.

At the conclusion of the said trial, the Learned High Court Judge had acquitted the second accused

above named on all counts against him. The 1 s\ 3rd and 4th accused on the indictment were found

guilty on the counts against them, and the 3rd and 4th accused preferred an appeal against the said

3

convictions and sentence imposed against them but the 1st accused who was tried in absentia had not

preferred an appeal against the conviction and sentence imposed on him.

However when the appeal preferred by the 3rd and the 4th accused to the original indictment was

pending, the 3rd accused namely Muthusami Pillai Dharmalingam had passed away and therefore the

present appeal before this court is restricted to the appeal preferred by the 4th accused to the indictment

namely Krishnasamy Ramachandran.

As further revealed before this court, out of 149 counts in the indictment, counts 1,5,51 to 65 and 130

to 149 were against the accused-appellant Ramachandran. Out of the said charges, the 1st charge is one

of conspiracy to commit mischief at Temple of Tooth relic using an explosive device and the 5th

charge is for aiding and abetting to commit the above act of mischief, charges 51 to 65 refers to 15

counts of aiding and abetting to cause the death of 15 named persons and counts 130 to 149 refers to

aiding and abetting to cause hurt to 21 named persons.

Even though the prosecution relied upon the confessionary statement made by the accused-appellant to

an Assistant Superintendent of Police as evidence against the accused-appellant under the provisions

of the Emergency Regulation, the Learned Trial Judge had declined to admit the confessionary

statement as evidence in this case, after an inquiry and therefore the entire prosecution case against the

accused -appellant is based on circumstantial evidence led at the trail.

The argument before us proceeded based on the single ground of appeal raised by the Learned Counsel

for the accused-appellant to the effect that;

Learned Trial Judge erred by concluding guilt of the 4th accused on the basis that his conduct

established the criminal element of participation in a conspiracy and or aiding and abetting of offences

charged.

4

In this regard the main argument raised by the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant was that

there wasn't adequate evidence placed before the High Court to establish, that the accused-appellant

had conspired along with the other accused and in furtherance of the said conspiracy, the accused-

appellant had intentionally aided and abetted others unknown to the prosecution to commit the crimes

of causing mischief to the Temple of Tooth relic with an explosive device, and causing grievous

injuries and causing death of the persons mentioned in the indictment.

Since the sole ground of appeal raised on behalf of the accused-appellant was based on the evidence

placed against the accused-appellant, I would now proceed to analyze the evidence led before the Trial

Judge mainly against the accused-appellant (4th accused in the High Court Trial)

As revealed before this court the alleged explosion took place in the early hours of 25th January 1998.

At the time the said explosion took place, the lorry involved in the explosion which was driven by the

suicide cardre was completely damaged beyond identification. The government analyst was

summoned to the scene of crime and his assistance was sought to gather evidence.

As revealed from the evidence of the investigating officers, a tyre of the lorry in question found among

the debris at the scene of crime had played a vital role in tracing to its previous owners. The

investigators have found the marking 5BY372 on a refilled tyre found among the debris at the scene of

crime. The said number led to the fact that the tyre had been refilled by the Associated Motor Ways

Company and sold to Isuru Tyre Center Kurunegala. According to the receipt books maintained at

Isuru Tyre Center, the said rebuilt tyre was sold to one Sumith Pathirana to be used in the lorry bearing

No 43-1396 on 14.08.1998.

In this regard the prosecution had relied on the evidence of Reginold Samaranayake at Isuru Tyre

Centre and Raja Sumith Pathirana ofWariyapola who is the previous owner of vehicle No 43-1396.

The said witnesses Samaranayake and Pathirana had identified the tyre at the High Court Trial.

5

As revealed from the evidence of witness Raja Sumith Pathirana, he had purchased the said lorry

bearing No 43-1396 to use in his business of selling vegetables through a vehicle broker, one

Ariyarathne. Later he decided to exchange the vehicle to a bigger lorry and managed to exchange the

lorry with his broker and returned the lorry bearing No 43-1396 to the said broker.

According to the evidence of witness Ariyarathne he kept the lorry at a vehicle sale belonging to one

Priyantha Gunawardena and with the help of Priyantha he found a buyer to purchase the said lorry.

When the sale took place on 06.12.1997 he too was present at the vehicle sale and the vehicle was sold

to Subramaniam Ravindran whose photograph was identified when he was giving evidence at the High

Court Trial.

Since the lorry was an open truck, the buyer wanted a full body to be fitted to the lorry since he was

said to have engaged in tobacco business and he had managed to arrange a full body fitted to the lorry

for Rs. 20,000/-

Witness had met Subramaniam (15t accused) once again few days prior to the explosion (most

probably on 14th December) near Central Finance and they went to Central Finance to transfer the

finance facility which was in the name of one Ratnasiri to the 15t accused after filling up some

documents.

In all these instances 15t accused had identified himself as a businessman from Trincomalee and was

married to a government servant from Trincomalee to whom the witness too had spoken, when they

went to transfer the finance facility.

As revealed from the evidence of witness Ariyarathne, the new buyer of the lorry bearing No. 43-1396

had managed to get a used full body fitted to it within few days for Rs. 20,000/- where as a good full

body would cost at least Rs. 200,000/-. The above evidence does not reveal any involvement of the 4th

accused to purchase of the lorry bearing No 43-1396.

6

The next important evidence comes through the evidence of Karupayya and Segar two employees of

Hindu Cultural Center Kandy.

According to the evidence of Karupayya the care taker of the Hindu Cultural Center Kandy, the 1st and

the 3rd accused to the indictment namely Ravindran and Dharmalingam had stayed at Hindu Cultural

Center along with lorry bearing No. 43-1396 since 12th January 1997 to 16th January 1997 and again

from 23rd January 1997 until 25th January morning with the same lorry bearing No. 43-1396. As

observed by this court the above stay at Hindu Cultural Center was confirmed through the receipt

books maintained at Hindu Cultural Center for the above period. According to the said receipts, in

addition to the above two suspects, the 4th accused to the indictment Ramachandran too had stayed at

the Hindu Cultural Centre with the 1st and the 3rd accused on 16th night.

During this period, on the request of the 3rd accused Dharmalingam, he instructed his employee Segar

to look for a garage to attend some repair of the lorry and according to the evidence of Segar, the lorry

was taken by him to replace the leaf spring to a garage in Mulgampola along with 1st and 3rd accused.

During this journey witness Segar had to drive the lorry since the accused were not familiar with the

roads in Kandy.

According to these two witnesses, 4th accused Ramachandran too had visited the Hindu Cultural

Center by 14th and since then he too was also present with the other two at Hindu Cultural Center on

several occasions and according to the records of Hindu Cultural Center 4th accused Ramachandran

had stayed with the other two on 16th night and 17th morning all three had left Hindu Cultural Center in

the lorry.

In this regard this court is mindful of the fact that the 4th accused is a resident from Kandy and he has

no reason to stay at Hindu Cultural Center unless he had some special reason to be with the other two

during that night.

7

In addition to the evidence of the above two witnesses, the evidence of retired PS Wijerathne was also

relied upon by the prosecution to establish the connection between 4th accused Ramachandran and the

other two and the lorry in question.

According to the evidence of the said witness Wijerathne, he was attached to a road check point at

Gatambe Junction on 16th evening and the movement of lorry bearing No 43-1396 was recorded at the

register maintained at the said check point by him and according to the said record. Lorry bearing No.

43-1396 had entered to Kandy town from the direction of Peradeniya at 7.30 pm driven by 4th accused

Ramachandran who had the Driving License No. 488605.

However as discussed above the said lorry was thereafter parked at Hindu Cultural Center until the

following morning.

After 1 i h morning neither the lorry nor the three accused were seen by anybody in Kandy and the next

recorded evidence commences on 220d January from the books maintained at a police check point at

Udayapura in the Eastern Province. According to the evidence of Police Constable R. Jayasekara, on

22.01.1998 the lorry bearing No 43-1396 had passed the above check point and proceeded towards

Ampara driven by one Ravindran (15t accused) who possessed the Driving License No. 103043 with

two other passengers. There had been some tobacco in the lorry.

This lorry was once again detected three kilometers away at Malwatta STF Camp at 3.30 pm but at

that time the vehicle was driven by Ramachandran. (4th accused) According to the evidence of R.P.C

Madduma Bandara three stacks of Tobacco was seen inside the lorry.

Police Constable Upali Ananda had checked the lorry bearing No 43-1396 at Bibila, Karandegala

Police Check Point on 22.01.1998 at 9.25 pm. According to this witness the driver at that time had

been the 4th accused Ramachandran. He too had noted that the lorry carried 3 stacks of Tobacco as its

cargo.

8

As further revealed from the evidence of a three-wheeler driver Anura Bandara and a Mechanic

Premathilake, both are from Bibila, the lorry bearing No. 43-1396 was attended to at Bibila by witness

Premathilake, since it had developed an engine problem at Bibila. It is witness Anura Bandara who

had helped the inmates of the lorry by taking them to Premathilake and witness Anura Bandara had a

dock identification of 4th accused Ramachandran as one person who travelled in the lorry and witness

Premathilake had made dock identification with regard to 3rd accused Dharmalingam and 4th accused

Ramachandran, which was not challenged during the High Court Trial.

Due to the said mishap, there was a delay in their journey and the lorry bearing No 43-1396 was

checked twice on 23.01.1998 once at Hasalaka Check Point by Police Constable Wijerathne and again

at Weeasebala Junction by Police Constable Kumarasinghe. On both these occasions the lorry was

driven by 4th accused Ramachandran. At Werasebala Junction, details of the driver had been fully

recorded as follows, "D.L. No. 488605 Address. No 200, Sarath Kade, Udaperadeniya."

However on both these occasions the time, vehicle passed the Check Point had not been recorded by

the said witnesses.

As revealed from the evidence led at the High Court Trial, the lorry bearing 43-1396 had finally

entered the Kandy Town from Thennekumbura Check Point on 23rd January at 17.30 hours driven by

4th accused Ramachandran. This position was confirmed by Police Constable Gamini Ranaviraja who

was attached to the said Check Point.

From the above evidence it was revealed that the vehicle in question which started its journey beyond

Ampara on 22nd January had reached Kandy on 23rd evening with only three stacks of Tobacco with

three passengers including 15t accused Ravindran, 3rd accused Darmalingam and 4th accused

Ramachandran. Except at Udayapura Check Point, in the entire trip between Ampara to Kandy the

lorry was driven by the 4th accused.

9

However as revealed from the evidence above, except for the three stacks of Tobacco nothing

suspicious was detected in the lorry at any such Check Point or even at Bibila when the vehicle was

attended by a mechanic to replace a broken Fan Belt.

The fact that the same vehicle which arrived Kandy on 23rd evening was used in the suicide attack on

the early hours of the 25th January, confirms that, the said vehicle was used to transport the explosives

concealed in the said vehicle. This fact is further confirmed by the long route taken by the suspects to

reach Kandy avoiding a shorter route via Maha-Oya, where the vehicles coming from the Eastern

Province were subjected to a thorough search. The three stacks of Tobacco which were observed at

several check points were inside the lorry when the blast took place, and this fact is confirmed by the

investigators in their evidence.

As revealed from the evidence of Karupayya and Segar the 15t and the 3rd accused have once again

checked in at the Hindu Cultural Center on 23rd evening with their lorry bearing No 43-1396 and the

lorry was parked at the Hindu Cultural Center until 25th morning. The lorry had not gone out from

Hindu Cultural Centre between 23rd until 25th morning and the three stacks of Tobacco were also

inside the lorry during this period. If the 15t and the 3 rd accused were interested in selling the tobacco

they had ample opportunity to sell them on 24th January, with the assistance of the 4th accused if the 4th

accused was employed by them as the driver to transport Tobacco to Kandy. As observed by us, the

three accused who were involved in transporting Tobacco had not taken any interest in disposing them

until the 25th morning. The vehicle which left Hindu Cultural Center on the 25th morning never

returned to Hindu Cultural Center. The fact that the lorry was parked at Hindu Cultural Center, in a

secured place will further confirm that the explosion took place on the 25th morning was a result of the

explosives carried in the lorry bearing No 43-1396.

Even though the accused-appellant decided to remain silent at the High Court Trial, it was argued on

behalf of him that the material referred to above, will only indicates his innocent conduct as a hired

10

driver but the said material is insufficient to establish his guilt in participating in a conspiracy and

aiding and abetting to commit criminal offences as referred to in the Indictment.

As revealed before this court, all 4 accused indicted before the High Court were facing a charge of

conspiracy to the effect that between 1st December 1997 and 25th January 1998 that they along with

others unknown to the prosecution conspired to cause mischief to the Temple of Tooth relic by

exploding an explosive device.

In the case of Kehar Singh V. Sate of Delhi 1998 Cr. LR (SC) 538; AIR 1988 SC 1883 it was decided

that, "in regard of Criminal Conspiracy there must be a prima facia evidence affording a reasonable

ground for a court to believe that two or more persons are members of conspiracy.

In the said circumstances, the fact that the 2nd accused to the indictment was acquitted after trial was

not a ground for the others to be acquitted for the charge of conspiracy, if there was sufficient material

to establish the criminal liability of the other three accused.

It is also important to note at this stage that there was no eye witnesses evidence, or any other

circumstantial material to establish that the conspirators prosecuted before the High Court were

physically present when the alleged attack took place on 25th morning in front of Dalada Maligawa. In

this regard this court is mindful of the decision in State of Tamil Nadu V. Nalini 1999 Cr IJ 3124

(SC); AIR 1999 SC 2640 to the effect that, where the evidence showing that accused was in thick of

conspiracy then his absence from the scene of crime is of no consequence and as such his conviction

for various offences need not to be interfered with.

As observed earlier, the prosecution in the case in hand was entirely depend on circumstantial

evidence placed before the court and when considering the said material this court will also have to be

mindful of the principles that should be applied when analyzing the circumstantial evidence.

11

In the case of Don Sunny V. Attorney General [1998]2 Sri LR 1 the said principles were identified as

follows;

1. When a charge is sought to be proved by circumstantial evidence the proved items of

circumstantial evidence when taken together must irresistibly point towards the only

inference that the accused committed the offence.

On a consideration of all the evidence the only inference that can be arrived at should be

consistent with the guilt of the accused only.

2. If on a consideration of the items of circumstantial evidence if an inference can be drawn

which is consistent with the innocence of the accused, then one cannot say that the charges

have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

3. If upon a consideration of the proved items of circumstantial evidence if the only inference

that can be drown is that the accused committed the offence then they can be found guilty.

4. The prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had the opportunity of

committing the offence, the accused can be found guilty only and only if the proved items

of circumstantial evidence is consistent with their guilt and inconsistent with their

mnocence.

in the said circumstances it is the duty of the prosecution when establishing the charges in the

indictment on circumstantial evidence, to place evidence before court, when taken together must

irresistibly points that the only inference that could be arrived is that the three accused along with

others unknown to the prosecution, between 1st December 1997 to 25 th January 1998 had conspired to

cause the mischief to the Temple of Tooth relic by exploding an explosive device and as a result of the

said conspiracy an explosive device was exploded at the Temple of Tooth relic on 25th January causing

mischief to the said Temple of Tooth relic and during the said explosion 15 civilians were killed and

several civilians were injured and the said three accused had aided and abetted the said offences.

f f t r f II , f , t t

~ 1!

12

However with regard to the fact that an explosion took place causing mischief to the Temple of Tooth

relic and during the said explosion 15 civilians were killed and several other civilians were injured

were well established before the High Court by the evidence of the investigating officers, relatives of

the deceased persons, Post Mortem Reports and Medico Legal Repots submitted by Judicial Medical

Officer, and the several injured persons but what is important to establish was that the only inference

that could be arrived was that the three accused before the High Court with others unknown to the

prosecution had conspired to cause the said act of mischief by exploding the explosive device and had

abetted the said explosion and to commit offences of murder and causing grievous injuries during the

same transaction and that no one else other than the three accused with other unknown to the

prosecution would have committed the said offences.

Even though the 4th accused was not involved in purchasing the lorry with the other accused namely

the 1st and the 3rd accused, the conduct of the 1st and the 3rd accused clearly indicates that they were

only interested in purchasing a lorry at a lowest price to serve a limited purpose. This fact was clearly

established from the evidence of Ariyarathne, when he said that the full body had cost only 20,000/-

where as a good full body would cost around 200,000/-.

The purpose as to why the accused looked for a lorry with a full body was revealed from the evidence

of the Government Analyst Sarath Gunathilake when he said in his evidence that,

"the explosive device would have been kept at a place closer towards the driving cabin placing it on

the same level or at the level of the chassis, and the said device would have been placed at the place

where goods are carried located at the corner close to the drivers cabin" (Pages 595, 596)

The above opinion of the Government Analyst was based on the scientific examinations conducted by

him but the said position was further confirmed from the evidence of Premathilake who replaced the

Fan-belt at Bibila. This witness had not observed anything suspicion in the engine compartment when

he attended to the said repair.

13

In the said circumstances it is clear that the 1st and the 3rd accused knew very well the purpose for

which the said lorry was purchased, when they were making the purchase.

It is after this purchase only the said two accused moved to the Hindu Cultural Centre on 12.01.1998.

As observed above the 4th accused (the accused-appellant in the present appeal) joined the 1st and the

3rd on 14/01.

According to the evidence of witnesses Karupayya and Segar, the 1st and the 3rd accused stayed at

Hindu Cultural Center since 12th January 1998. During their stay they kept some money with

Karupayya for safe custody, the lorry was attended to during this period with the help of Segar but

Segar had to drive the vehicle since the said two accused were not familiar with the roads in Kandy.

Two days later, on 14th the January the 4th accused Dharmalingam had visited these two and since then

all three were seen together by witnesses.

The 4th accused Dharmalingam was a resident from Udaperadeniya but he too had stayed the night at

Hindu Cultural Center with the other two on 16th Night and the following morning all three had left

Hindu Cultural Center in the lorry in question. Even on the same evening i.e. on 16th evening, the 16th

movement of this lorry was recorded at Gatambe junction and at that time the lorry was driven by the

4th accused.

Since 17'h morning up to 22nd afternoon the movements of the said three accused and the lorry bearing

No. 43-1396 was not recorded by anybody but, the lorry left Hindu Cultural Center on 17'h morning

had surfaced only on 22nd afternoon 3 miles away from Ampara when the lorry was coming towards

Ampara, clearly indicated that the journey commenced on 16th morning with 1 s" 3rd and 4th accused

had ended up beyond Ampara in the Eastern Province. That is the only inference this court can reach

when considering the material before this court. The fact that the 4th accused being a resident from

Kandy had stayed the night at Hindu Cultural Center too confirms the position that the three accused

f ; I! 1 i I I,

f

~

I

i It I

14

planned to leave Kandy early hours of 16th and therefore all three stayed together at Hindu Cultural

Center during that night.

The 1st accused pretended to be a person involved in Tobacco business and the reason why he wanted

to have a full body was to Transport Tobacco in the said lorry. If the journey from Kandy to Eastern

Province was to bring a load of Tobacco, no purpose would serve by them bringing three stacks of

Tobacco from the Eastern Province to Kandy if they were involved in a genuine business enterprise. If

the 4th accused was only a hired driver, the court cannot understand why he was hired for nearly 6 days

and gone to the Eastern Province, just to transport three stacks of Tobacco in the lorry in question.

The next important item of evidence placed before the trial court was the long route taken by the three

accused to come to Kandy. As revealed from the evidence it is clear that they have avoided coming

through Maha Oya, a much shorter route to come to Kandy and decided to come through Bibila. As

revealed at the trial, at Maha Oya all the vehicles travelled from the Eastern Province are subject to a

thorough check and only conclusion this court can reach in this regard is that the three accused had

purposel y avoided Maha Oya check point by coming through a much longer route.

The answer as to why the accused decided to avoid Maha Oya check point, once again comes from the

evidence of the Government Analyst Sarath Gunathilake.

According to the findings of the Government Analyst 200kg TNT high explosives had been used to

cause the explosion and according to him the area covered by the said explosives would be roughly

6"x2?,'x42" or the size of four bags of cement.

When considering the said findings of the Government Analyst, it is difficult to conclude that the

above quantity of explosives were placed in the lorry without the attention of the driver and therefore

the purpose of taking a longer route was to avoid the lorry being detected at Maha Oya with the

explosives.

15

As observed by this court after the prosecution closed its case and when the trial judge explained the

three accused who faced the trial, of their rights the 4th accused, (the accused-appellants before us)

decided to remain silent and his case was closed without leading any evidence.

However as observed above, strong material was placed before the court, with regard to the

involvement of the 4th accused, including transporting the explosives to Kandy from the eastern

province, as to what he was doing on 16th night at Hindu Cultural Center with the 1st and the 3rd

accused and his whereabouts between 1 i h to 220d until their movements were recorded in Ampara on

220d January 1998. It was further observed by us that the reason as to why a longer route was selected

to come to Kandy instead of coming through Maha Oya with only three stocks of Tobacco and this too

could only be explained by the 4th accused.

As observed by this court, in addition to the above material, there was additional material against the

15t and the 3rd accused with regard to their involvement in purchasing the lorry, getting a cheaper body

fitted to the lorry and their financial dealings with the staff members of the Hindu Cultural Center.

When considering all these material along with the fact that the lorry involved in the explosion at the

Temple of Tooth relic on the early hours of 25th January 1998, one day after its arrival from the eastern

Province clearly suggest that the three accused who faced the indictment before the High Court were

actively taken part in the conspiracy to commit mischief at the Temple of Tooth relic by exploding an

explosive device.

When the prosecution had led strong evidence suggestive of the above, the 4th accused, the accused-

appellant before this court, with the above damning evidence led against him, did not made any

attempt to explain the circumstances under which the said events took place.

In this regard this court is mindful of the dictum of Lord Ellenborough in the case of R Vs. Lord

Cochrane and others 1814 Gurney's Report 479 to the effect;

16

" No person accused of a crime is bound of offer any explanation of his conduct or of circumstances of

suspicion which attach to him; but nevertheless if he refuses to do so, where a strong prima facia case

has been made out, and when it is in his own power to offer evidence, if such exist, in explanation of

such suspicions appearance which would show them to be fallacious and explicable consistently with

his innocence, it is a reasonable and justifiable conclusion that he refrains from doing so only from the

conviction that the evidence so suppressed or adduced would operate adversely to his interest."

The above dictum was followed by our courts on several occasions including in the case of

Somarathne Rajapakse and Others V. Attorney General SC Appeal 2/2002 (TAB) SC minutes

03.02.2004.

In the said case Shiranee Bandaranayake J (as she was then) had observed,

"With all this damning evidence against the applicants with the charges including murder and, rape,

the applicants did not offer, any explanation with regard to any of the matters referred to above.

Although there cannot be a direction that the accused person must explain each and every

circumstance relied on by the prosecution and the fundamental principle being that no person accused

of a crime is bound to offer any explanation of his conduct, there are permissible limitations in which

it would be necessary for a suspect to explain the circumstances of suspicion which are attached to

him. As pointed out in Queen V. Santin Singho (1962) 65 NLR 445 if a strong case has been made

out against the accused, and if he declines to offer an explanation although it is in his power to offer

one, it is a reasonable conclusion that the accused is not doing so because the evidence suppressed

would operate adversely on him. The dictum of Lord Ellenborough in R. Vs. Lord Cochrane

(Gurney's Reports 479) which has been followed by our courts (R. Vs. Seeder Silva (1940) NLR

337), Q Vs. Santin Singho (1962) 65 NLR 445, Premathilake Vs. The Republic of Sri Lanka (1972)

75 NLR 506, Richard V. The State (1973) 76 NLR 534, Illangantillake V. The Republic of Sri

Lanka (1984) 2 Sri L.R. 38 described this position in very clear terms."

17

The above judicial pronouncement including the finding of the several cases referred to above in the

said decision of the Supreme Court reflect the consensus of judicial opinion on the effect of an accused

person's failure to offer an explanation in the circumstances referred to above. Similarly in the case in

hand the failure by the accused-appellant to give an explanation though not be treated as equivalent to

an admission of the case against him but may add considerably to the weight of the latter.

In the said circumstances when the failure by the accused-appellant to give an explanation, considered

along with the damning evidence which indicates that there was a conspiracy between the three

accused including the accused-appellant to transport high explosives from the Eastern Province to

Kandy in order to explode an explosive device at the Temple of Tooth relic, we are of the view that the

trial judge has not erred in coming to a finding of guilt against the appellant.

In this regard the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant whilst reI ying on the following passage.

In the case of Queen V. Liyanage 67 NLR 193 at 206 to the effect that,

"The question is not whether we can draw the inference of conspiracy, but whether the facts are such

that they cannot fairly admit any other inference being drawn from them. One has to be satisfied that

there is such an irresistible inference against accused that he did so conspire."

and had argued that the material available in the case in hand is insufficient to come to such inference,

but we cannot agree with the said submission in the light of the damning evidence available in this

case and therefore we agree with the Learned High Court Judge when he concluded that the only

irresistible inference that can reach is that the 4th accused (accused-appellant in the present case) did

conspire with the 1st, 3rd and others unknown to prosecution to commit mischief at the Temple of

Tooth relic by exploding an explosive device and also, abetted the said explosion, abetted to cause the

death of 15 named people and to cause injuries to several other named persons, by transporting the

explosive device from the Eastern Province to Kandy canceled inside the lorry bearing No 43-1396

driven by the accused-appellant.
