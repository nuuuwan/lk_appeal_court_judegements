Court considers the submissions of both Counsel and the

brief before us. It appears that the accused-appellant had pleaded guilty

of possessing a hand grenade which is punishable under Section 2(1)(b) of

the Offensive Weapons Act No.18 of 1966. The offence was committed on

03.08.1994 and considering the period he has been incarcerated and now

he is 52 years of age who wishes to settle in his life and considering the

fact that the maximum sentence in the said Law is ten years rigorous

imprisonment and the learned High Court Judge has considered that he

has escaped from the Prison as an aggravating factor. After considering

all circumstances, this court is of the view that the sentence imposed is

excessive. Considering all the factors we set aside the sentence of 10 years

rigorous imprisonment and impose five years rigorous imprisonment and

the same to be implemented from the date of conviction.

The Prison Authorities are hereby directed to implement the

sentence from the date of conviction, namely 05.09.2016.

The fine and the default sentence will remain as it is.

Registrar is directed to forward the case record to the

Registrar, High Court of Gampaha for the implementation of the sentence.
