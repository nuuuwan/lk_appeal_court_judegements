Judgment

s. Thurairaja PC J

This is a case of double murder reported at the Police station of Gokarella. The AG

had preferred an indictment against 3 accused persons namely Uagedhara Hewage

Justin alias Kumarasinghe, Bastiangamage Nimalaratne Jayathilaka alias Nihal and

Bastiangamage Shantha Jayathilake alias Palitha for committing the murder of

Wijekoon Mudiyanselage Wimalawathi and Kotadurage Vasantha. As per the

indictment the offence was committed on 14.11.2001. Almost at the tail end of the

case for the prosecution the State Counsel informed the Court that there is no

evidence against the 2nd and 3rd accused, hence he is terminating the case against

them. The learned Trial Judge made an order dated 18.12.2014 and acquitted those 2

accused persons.

Prosecution called the Court interpreter and closed the case against the 1st accused.

When the defence called the accused appellant made a statement from the dock.

Trial Judge after hearing the submission of both counsels delivered his judgment on

27.04.2015. Accused was found guilty for double murder and sentenced to death.

Being aggrieved with the said conviction and sentence the accused appellant

preferred an appeal to this Court. He had raised the following grounds of appeal

(This has been reproduced from the appellant's written submission as follows):

1. The 2nd incident which resulted in the deaths of the victims being purely based

on circumstantial evidence, items of circumstantial evidence are wholly

inadequate to support the conviction for murder.(i.e. to draw a necessary,

inescapable, irresistible and one and only inference that it was the appellant

and no one else who inflicted the fatal injuries.)

0.",.0 ., "f 1.,

2. Following closely on the heels of ground 1, learned Trial Judge failed to

address his judicial mind to the fact that the conviction hinges on

circumstantial evidence.

3. Prosecution has failed to exclude the possibility of a 3rd party being the

perpetrator to the appellant.

4. Learned Trial Judge has misread himself on a critical issue of fact which IS

wholly prejudicial to the appellant.

5. With regard to the 1st incident of attack, evidence led at the trial warrants the

consideration of the plea of grave and sudden provocation and/or sudden

fight.

It will be appropriate to consider the facts of the case briefly.

The accused appellant was married to the 1 st deceased Wimalawathi and had two

children. On the fateful day i.e. 14.09.2001 he had returned home uninformed in the

middle of the night where he found his wife with Wasantha on the bed, stark nude.

He was shocked and provoked. He woke his 10 years old son who was sleeping in the

adjoining room and he told his neighbour Karunaratne that there was a thief at

home. Another neighbour Udhayaratne Bandara on hearing the commotion was

present at the scene. The accused bound his wife and her paramour with a nylon

thread and proceeded to the parents of his wife which is situated at Matale. He got

the assistance of his brother who is the 2nd accused in this case to go to Matale. He

reached his parents in laws' house at around 3.30 am and told them about the

incident. He had told his mother in law that he had assaulted and tied them. All of

them returned to the house of the accused. Mother in law Somawathie had noticed

her daughter and another man were tied up. This was around 4.00 to 4.30 a.m. The

mother had administered the daughter to the effect "See what you have done."

(oibotsl18 smmma o~ ~ 6tom.) Deceased daughter pleaded with the mother that

she had been assaulted and her hand was injured and to take her to the hospital. But

the mother declined it and went to the Police station with her husband and her son

in law, accused appellant.

When they went to the Police station around 6.00 to 6.30 am, the police had not

started their work. Therefore they waited there for a while. At that time the father of

the deceased had gone to a nearby shop. The accused had told that he wants to go

to the toilet. When the mother in law asked him to use the facilities in the Police

station he said he will go to a nearby shop and left the station.

The police entertained the complain from the mother of the deceased and

proceeded to the scene of crime at around 7.45 a.m.

In the meantime Karunaratne and Udhayaratne Bandara speak to the fact that the

accused was there at around 7.00 a.m. and made arrangement for the children to

have their breakfast. The 2nd and 3rd accused persons were also there. When the

police went they observed that there was a crowd of 200 people at the scene. When

the witnesses and the police entered the house they had found both deceased were

in a pool of blood and blood was spattered allover the wall. The accused was not

found at the scene. The witnesses spoke to the fact that the accused had taken the

children and bought them breakfast and handed them over to his relative to look

after. After a short while he handed himself to the police. The other two accused

persons surrendered after few days to the police.

Considering the sequence of the events it is clear that there are two episodes

unfolded by witnesses. First incident is to cause injuries to one of the deceased

Wimalawathie and the second incident is causing injuries and death to deceased

persons by some person or persons.

Prosecution has led the evidence of four lay witnesses, three police witnesses and

Judicial Medical Officer (JMO). Further they have marked 5 productions which consist

of crowbar, knife, nylon cord and two post-mortem reports.

CA 122/2015JUDGMENT Pa~f> 4 of 12

The learned Trial Judge delivered his judgment and found the accused guilty after

giving reasons. The Trial Judge had passed only one sentence for two counts of

murder.

Considering the judgment and the available evidence the case IS based on

circumstantial evidence.

Considering the grounds of appeal raised by the Counsel for the accused appellant, it

can be reduced as follows:

(a) Concept of circumstantial evidence was not properly considered.

(b) The Trial Judge has confused the motive and the actual evidence of and

against the accused appellant.

The prosecution witnesses namely the mother of the 1st deceased and the son of the

accused and 1st deceased Wimalawathi, had to be weighed separately from the other

two witnesses who were his neighbours.

Salindha Justin Kumarasinghe son of the accused appellant and the first deceased

was 10 years old at that time. He was in the house at the time of the incident. He

witnessed the accused and both deceased were grappling there. He does not speak

of any assault of fatal in nature. He confirms that the father left to his grandparents

place and returned with them. He identified the 2nd deceased who was little known to

him as a tailor in the town. He testified to the effect that his mother was lying fallen

on the ground and whimpered saying that "Lahiru son I can't get up." He also said

that the neighbour Karune mama (Karunaratne) took them to his house after the

incident. He had not witnessed anyone causing fatal injuries to his deceased mother

nor the 2nd deceased.

The Witness Somawathi who is the mother of the 1st deceased and the mother in law

of the accused appellant sheds more light into the case. She said that they were

living in Matale. The accused appellant had come to their home at the wee hours of

the night and told her that the deceased was caught red handed when she was with

IlJnGMENT Paee 5 of12

her paramour and that he had assaulted and tied them up. There is some

discrepancy in her evidence from non-summary inquiry to trial. She returned in the

vehicle to her daughter's place in Ibbagamuwa with her husband and the accused

appellant. She cannot remember the exact time but it was between 4.00 to 4.30 a.m.

When she came to her daughter's place she had seen her daughter lying fallen on

the ground at the entrance to the bedroom. Her hands and legs were bound. She

also noticed that another man lay fallen inside the room in a similar manner. These

witnesses had admonished her daughter saying 'see what you have done.' The

deceased was begging the mother to take her to hospital, but she refused and went

to the Police station with her husband and accused appellant (son in law).

The witness (mother of the 1st deceased) affirms that the accused had taken them to

the Police station and he was there at around 6.30-7.00 a.m. She also says that her

husband had gone to a nearby place similarly the accused said that he wants to go

to the toilet. When she asked him to use the toilet in the police station, he had told

that he will go to a nearby boutique. Thereafter she had not seen the accused

appellant at the police station. She lodged the complaint and went to the scene of

crime together with the police. There she had observed crowd of people gathered

near the house. She went into the house which was opened and noticed both

deceased persons in a pool .of blood. Further she had observed spattering of the

blood all over the wall of the bedroom. She had not seen anybody causing this to the

deceased persons.

When considering these two witnesses namely the mother and son of the deceased

no one had witnessed the second incident. It is the burden of the prosecution to

prove that the accused appellant had caused the death of the deceased persons.

Next two witnesses are Udhayaratne Bandara and R.D. Karunaratne these two are

neighbours of the accused and the deceased. Udhayaratne speaks to the fact that on

the previous night at around 10.00 and 11.00 p.m. he heard a commotion from the

direction of the accused house. When he went he had seen the both the deceased

CA 122/2015 JUDGMENT Page 6 of12

persons lying fallen on the ground. When he asked what happened she had said

"nothing happened." (~ mt(5)t ~). Further, the witness testified that the

accused had told him that these two were caught when involved in an adulterous

affair. Thereafter he had seen the accused leaving to his in laws. This evidence

corroborates with the evidence of the first two witnesses.

This witness talks about the second incident where he had seen the accused

appellant bring the parents of the deceased to show the wife and the other person

and left to the police station.

Thereafter on the following morning the accused brought his two sons and entrusted

them to this witness to give breakfast and to look after. At that time the house was

open and there was a crowd including the other two accused persons who are

brothers of the accused appellant.

He testified to the fact on the first incident when he went in the night he had seen

that the deceased persons were alive and there was no blood splatter anywhere.

On the second time he had not gone into the house, when he saw the accused

appellant that was around 7.00 a.m. The accused was seen making arrangements to

buy string hoppers for the breakfast of his two sons. Further the witness had noticed

that the accused was dispersing the crowd and saying that the police will come there.

At that time the 3rd accused was also there. Thereafter he had seen the accused

taking his children in a three-wheeler. Accused appellant was not seen till the police

arrived at the scene of crime.

The next witness Karunaratne who is also a neighbour had heard a commotion on

the previous night at the house of the accused appellant and had gone there. When

he asked what happened, the accused appellant had told that a thief had come. Then

the accused appellant had asked this witness what to do. The witness had advised

the accused to handover "the person" to the police. He had gone into the house and

CA 122/2015 JUDGMENT Page 7 of 12

noticed the wife of the accused and another person were lying fallen on the ground

close to each other.

He also corroborates the above witness.

Both witnesses speak on three episodes. Incident in the midnight on which they have

seen both deceased fallen lying on the floor and no injuries noticed. They say that

the accused appellant and his in laws were seen going to the police station. The

accused was seen again in morning at around 7.00 a.m. attending to the needs of the

children, missing from there and surrendering to the police at about 10.00 a.m. Police

had come to the scene around 7.45 a.m. All four lay witnesses do not say whether the

house was closed and if there was access to any person other than the accused.

The other official witnesses speak about the injuries and investigations.

Considering all evidence, the burden of proof falls upon the prosecution to provide

circumstantial evidence to the fact that this accused appellant and he alone

committed the offence of murder of the two deceased persons.

Supreme Court of India in Manivel and Others v State of Tamil Nadu in Criminal

Appeal No. 473 of 2001 (2008 INDLAW SC 1239) on 08 Aug 2008 held that while

dealing with circumstantial evidence, it has been held that onus was on the

prosecution to prove that the chain is complete and the infirmity of lacuna in

prosecution cannot be cured by false defence or plea. The conditions precedent in

the words of this Court, before conviction could be based on circumstantial evidence,

must be fully established. They are:

(1) "the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should

be fully established. The circumstances concerned 'must' or 'should and not

'may be' established;

(2) the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis

of the guilt of the accused, that is to say, they should not be

explainable on any other hypothesis except that the accused is guilty,

CA 122 2015 JUDGMENT Page 8 of 12

(3) the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency;

(4) they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved;

(5) there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any

reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the

accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have

been done by the accused."

[Emphasis Added]

In Padala Veera Reddy Vs. State of AP and ors 1989 Indlaw SC 31 it was laid

down that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence such evidence must satisfy

the following tests:

(1) "The circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn

must be cogently and firmly established~

(2) Those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing

towards the guilt of the accused;

(3) The circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that

there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the

crime was committed by the accused and none else; and;

(4) The circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete

and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt

of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the

guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence."

[Emphasis Added]

In Samantha Vs Republic of Sri Lanka 2010 SLLR 236 the court stated that:

"In a case of Circumstantial Evidence, if an inference of guilt is to be drawn

against the accused such inference must be the one and only irrestible and

inescapable inference that the accused committed the crime."

CA 122/2015JUDGMENT Paee 9 of 12

In Emperor vs Brownrig 1917 18 Criminal Law Journal 482 it was held that:

"the Jury must decide whether the facts proved exclude the possibility that the

act was done by some other person and if they have doubts, prisoner must

have the benefit of those doubts."

In Don Sunny vs. the Attorney General (1998) 2 SLR 1 it was held thus

"that the prosecution must prove that no one else other than the accused had

the opportunity of committing the offence",

In R v Clarke (1995) 78 A Crim R 226 it was held thus

"if evidence raises a reasonable possibility that the circumstances pointed to

someone other than the accused being guilty of the offence, then a direction

about the need to exclude such a possibility beyond reasonable doubt should

usually be given. Such a direction should be give even if the evidence is very

slight, if it could be interpreted as raising a reasonable possibility of innocence."

In Akpan v. State (2001) FW loR [pt. 56] 735, at page number 749 it was held that

"Circumstantial evidence must lead to only one conclusion to ground

conviction. Where there are other possibilities in the case other than that the

accused committed murder and there is another person who had the

opportunity to commit the offence for which the accused is charged, he cannot

be convicted for the offence"

In the instant case as afore-submitted prosecution has failed to establish a strong

cogent prima facie case and in the said circumstances the principles enunciated in R.

vs. Burdett 1820 4B Alderman Reports 95, at page 120 wherein it was held thus

"No person is required to explain or contradict until enough has been proved to

warrant a reasonable and just conclusion against him ...... "

CA 122/2015 JUDGMENT Page 10of12

In Sri Lanka the position is the same wherein Gunewardena V The Republic of Sri

Lanka 1985 (2) SLR 315 it was held that

"When no prima facie case has been made against an accused, he need not

offer an explanation. It is open to the Accused to rely safely on the presumption

of innocence or on the infirmity of the evidence of the Prosecution."

Considering the facts of this case, one can easily conclude that the accused appellant

had a strong motive to commit this offence. Further even a layman will conclude that

this accused may have committed this offence. When perusing the evidence,

hypothetically, if we think that the accused had committed this offence this would be

a textbook case for the Trial Judge to consider grave and sudden provocation. Even

in certain occasion loss of self control resulting insanity.

When perusing the judgment, I find that the Judge has analyzed the facts and

circumstances with the probability of motive of accused. The Judge has not

separated the two incidents and addressed his mind to the concept of circumstantial

evidence. The simple question to be asked and answered is whether anybody other

than the accused had an opportunity to commit this offence?

It is observed that there were three suspects arrested and produced in connection

with these murders. Non-summary inquiry was held and the Magistrate was satisfied

that there were sufficient evidence against all three suspects to place it before the

High Court. The Attorney General also considered all the materials before him and

preferred an indictment against all three accused persons. The State Counsel

commenced and continued with trial against ali three accused persons almost till this

end of case for the prosecution. This shows that the Attorney General was convinced

that there was substantial evidence against the other two accused whom he moved

to discharge later. The trial Judge had not considered and excluded participation of

these two accused persons.

I also observe that the Trial Judge had convicted the accused appellants on two

counts and passed only one sentence.

CA 122/2015 JUDGMENT Page 11 of12

Considering all available material and the reasons discussed above, I find that there is

no exclusive evidence against the accused appellant for committing murders of 1st

deceased Wimalawathi and 2nd deceased Wasantha. Therefore I find that the

conviction for murder cannot be sustained.

Accordingly, we allow the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence against

the accused appellant on both counts.

Appeal allowed.
