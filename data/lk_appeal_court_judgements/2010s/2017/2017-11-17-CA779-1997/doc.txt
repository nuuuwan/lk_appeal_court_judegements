This appeal emanates from an appeal of a judgment given by

the learned District Judge of Kegalle in respect of a plaint that had been

filed by the plaintiff-respondent seeking, that he be declared the absolute

owner of the property described in the schedule to the plaint, and for

ejectment of the defendant and his agents. It is also to be noted that the

plaintiff-respondent sought damages estimated at Rs.3000 from the

defendant. The above plaint had been amended by the amended plaint

dated 19.10.1987. The defendant has filed answer and the case

proceeded on issues raised at the trial dated 3rd April 1990. Issues No. 1

to 9 were raised by the respondent and issues Nos. 10-23 were raised by

the appellant.

The appellant gave evidence and called a witness Rev.

Welihene Dhammapaha Thero and closed the case by marking

documents VI to V7. The plaintiff-respondent gave evidence and marked

documents PI to P8. The learned District Judge on 7th October 1997

delivered the judgment granting relief to the plaintiff-respondent. Being

aggrieved by the said judgment the defendant-appellant had lodged this

appeal in this Court. (The learned District Judge had considered the

evidence and the documents marked by the respective parties and had

analyzed the evidence adduced before her.)

The plaintiff in the original Court adduced evidence and said

that the original owner of the land in dispute Galamunalage Ukku and

the said Ukku had transferred the said property to one Pina. Pina

subsequently had transferred the ownership of this land by Deed bearing

No.5379 dated 22nd May 1974 to the plaintiff-respondent Kuda

Kandalagedara Magilin Silva. The said Deed had been marked as PI.

The land described in the schedule is referred in the third schedule as

GalIena Mulla Hena in extent 3 Pela of paddy. The defendant-appellant

had contested the identity of the corpus and had tried to show that the

plaint does not describe the land in dispute precisely. The Preliminary

Survey Plan bearing No.832 was marked as Xl and the corresponding

report as Xl. The contention of the defendant-appellant in the original

Court was that the extent of the land is 3 acres and % acre according to

3

the above said Plan marked as X and his contention was that the extent

according to the plaint 2 Acres, lRood, 6 Perches.

The learned District Judge had very correctly analyzed the

above contention and had observed that 3 boundaries marked in the

above Plan marked X are compatible with that of the plaint and therefore

the contention regarding the identity of the corpus cannot be contested.

The plaintiff-respondent had marked 8 documents. PI Deed

bearing No.5379, P2 Notice of assessment of standard crop small

holdings for the year ending 1935, P3 Notice of assessment of standard

crop small holdings for the year ending 1936, P4 a similar document for

the year 1938. All P2 to P4 indicate the proprietor/lessee as Pina.

Document marked P6 pertains to a land dispute pertaining to a breach of

the peace where the orc of Aranayaka Police had filed information in

which the first party is the plaintiff-respondent and the second party is

the defendant-appellant. According to the journal entries the parties had

agreed to file action in the relevant Civil Court to vindicate their rights

and the defendant-appellant asserts that he was given possession in the

said land in dispute. But the learned District Judge had very clearly

The defendant-appellant had marked V2 a Plan bearing No.94694, but

the learned District Judge had very clearly analyzed and had come to the

conclusion that this plan does not throw any light on the disputed land

and that she had very correctly said -"?S)t)~ e ~Ii!lc.o t)~~t) ~lGt)

Furthermore, the learned District Judge had observed that no

superimposition had been done by the defendant-appellant. In this

context the vital documents marked by the defendant does not even

prove on the balance of probability that the disputed land was possessed

by him.

After analyzing the said evidence the learned District Judge

had come to the correct conclusion and held with the plaintiff-

respondent. As contended by the said plaintiff-respondent the learned

District Judge had the opportunity of hearing and seeing the witnesses

before her.

The most recent judgment in this respect is Alwis vs.

Piyasena Fernando 1993 1 SLR page 119, His Lordship G.P.S. De Silva

as he then was held that "it is well established that the findings of

primary facts by a trial judge who sees and hears the witnesses are not

likely to be disturbed in appeal". In the circumstances, we see no reason

to interfere with the judgment of the learned District Judge. Hence, the

appeal stand dismissed.
