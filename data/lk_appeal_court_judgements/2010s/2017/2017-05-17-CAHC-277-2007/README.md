Learned High Court Judge has commenced, conducted and concluded the

trial against the Accused Appellant as he had pleaded not guilty to the

charges when the same was read over to him. At the end of the trial

learned High Court Judge by his judgment dated 2007-09-12 had convicted

the Accused Appellant on counts 1, 3, 5 and 7 of the Indictment and had

decided not to convict the Accused Appellant on other counts namely

counts 2, 4, 6 and 8 on the basis that they relate to the same incident

referred to in the other counts. Upon conviction learned High Court Judge

has sentenced the Accused Appellant to a term of 04 years RI and to a fine

of Rs. 2500/= with a default sentence of 01 year RI in respect of each

count (Counts 1,3,5 and 7). Learned High Court Judge has also directed

that the amount accepted as a bribe Rs. 5000/= be recovered as a fine for

which a further default sentence of 06 Months RI was also imposed.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Accused Appellant has preferred

this appeal to this Court.

6

Although learned President's Counsel appearing for the Accused Appellant

raised several issues in the course of his submissions before this Court, it

could be seen that this Court is in a position to dispose this appeal by

sufficiently focusing on the main argument advanced on behalf of the

Accused Appellant.

The said main argument advanced by the learned President's Counsel

appearing for the Accused Appellant is that the learned High Court Judge

has failed to evaluate or take into conSideration, the infirmities of the case

for the prosecution. It is the submission of the learned President's Counsel

that there exists a major contradiction between the evidence of the virtual

complainant and that of the evidence of officers of the Bribery Commission

who participated in the raid.

In order to evaluate this argument it is necessary for this Court to consider

the effect of the evidence on the relevant pOints adduced by the above

mentioned two segments of the prosecution witnesses.

The position taken up in his evidence by the virtual complainant namely

Keerakotuwe Gedera Rohan Wijenayake is that all the officers (three

officers) of the Bribery Commission who participated in the raid were inside

7

his house when the accused Appellant accepted the gratification of Rs.

1000/= from him on 1998-02-18. He has made this position clear in no

un'certain terms in his evidence, both in the course of his evidence in chief1

and his cross examination2 It is his testimony that he waited with PC

24221 Herath (who acted as the decoy in the raid) in the main sitting area

of the house while two other officers stayed separately in two different

rooms in the same house. Thus it is his position that a total number of

three officers took positions inside his house.

However the prosecution witness No. 02 - PC 24221 Herath (the decoy)

has clearly stated in his evidence that only he as a Bribery Officer stayed

with the virtual complainant Rohan Wijenayake in the house3 On being

asked by the learned counsel for the defence this witness, (PC Herath) has

categorically excluded the presence of any other Bribery Officer inside the

house at this moment of the raid. This witness (PC Herath), on being asked

by the learned counsel for the defence to do so, has verified and confirmed

this position after refreshing his memory by going through the notes he

1 Page 56 (evidence in chief), of the brief,

2 Page 81 (cross examination), of the brief,

3 Page 109 of the brief,

8

had made in relation to this raid4 It is his position that the other Bribery

Officers took up positions outside and at places around the houses.

The position taken up by Bribery Officer Liyanarachchi who was called by

the prosecution to corroborate the evidence of PC Herath (decoy) is also

the same. He stated in his evidence that it is only PC Herath who stayed

with the virtual Complainant at his residence. Thus that becomes the

concrete position of the official witnesses who participated and conducted

the raid. It is his position that he along with the other officers went to the

house of the virtual complainant after PC Herath gave a signal indicating

that the bribe was handed over6.

Analysis of the above evidence clearly show that it has been positively

established in the trial, in unequivocal terms, that there exists a clear

contradictory position between the positions taken up by the virtual

complainant on one hand and the raiding Bribery officers on the other with

regard to the above point.

The next question that arises for consideration before this Court is to find

out the course of action that has been adopted by the learned High Court

4 Page 120 of the brief

5 Page 113 of the brief.

6 Page 148 of the brief.

Judge in this regard. Learned High Court Judge in his judgment inter alia

has stated7 that;

i. the defence failed to challenge the evidence of the prosecution with

regard to the soliciting and accepting the bribe.

ii. no negative impact has been caused to the roots of the prosecution

case by the minor discrepancies elicited from the evidence of the

prosecution witnesses.

iii. the dock statement of the accused has failed to create a reasonable

doubt in the prosecution case.

It is significant to note that other than the penultimate paragraph which

contained a solitary reference set out above in most general terms, there is

no other reference made by the learned High Court Judge with regard to

the discrepancy highlighted by the defence.

It is the evidence of Bribery Officer Liyanarachchi that three Police Officers

namely PC 19596 Senevirathne, PC 24221 Herath, PC 17354 Fonseka

participated along with him in this raid. PC 24221 Herath acted as the

decoy in this instance while IP Liyanarachchi had come to arrest the

accused Appellant after he accepted the bribe. The prosecution has

10

maintained a deafening silence on the whereabouts of the two other

bribery officers namely PC 19596 Senevirathne and PC 17354 Fonseka who

formed part of the team, at the time of the events leading to the arrest of

the Accused Appellant. Thus the only evidence available before the Court

on this aspect is the evidence of the virtual Complainant that they took

position inside the house in two separate rooms. This fact is denied by the

decoy PC Herath. It is important to note that this is only a bare denial

Having regard to the fact that the evidence of the main witness of the

prosecution has been cut across by the other witnesses called by the

prosecution to corroborate the main witness, it is the view of this Court;

i. That there exists a major contradiction between the evidence of the

virtual complainant and that of the evidence of officers of the Bribery

Commission,

ii. That the said contradiction cannot be termed as a minor

contradiction,

iii. That this contradiction is material in the light of the facts of this case

as it throws a considerable amount of light on the question of

credibility of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses,

,

\

11

iv. That this contradiction therefore is a contradiction which shakes the

very foundation of the prosecution case as it raises questions as to

the way the said raid has been conducted.

v. That in the light of that it becomes imperative for the learned trial

judge to have addressed his mind on the effect of this contradiction

(which he has failed to do),

vi. That a mere passing general remark on the effect of such

contradiction without adducing any reason as to why it cannot be

considered as material, cannot, in the light of the facts of this case,

amount to any valid consideration of such contradiction.

vii. Presence of such a statement in the judgment of the trial judge

which cannot be substantiated from available evidence would amount

to an indication that the learned trial Judge had not taken any

interest to consider the submission by the defence on this point.

It is relevant to note at this stage that the learned trial Judge has not

considered at least most of the other issues complained by the learned

Counsel for the Accused Appellant as no mention could be found in the

judgment with regard to those issues as well.

12

Further it is the view of this Court that in the light of the above facts the

assertion by the learned trial Judge that the prosecution has proved its

case beyond reasonable doubt becomes an assertion which cannot be

substantiated by evidence available in the case. Thus it cannot be

permitted to stand and must be struck down.

The question this court will have to address next is whether this Court

should order a retrial. The burden to prove the charges framed against the

accused beyond reasonable doubt lies fairly and squarely on the

prosecution. The version of the raiding police officers as to how the raid

was conducted is clear and has already been recorded in their notes. That

position cannot be changed. The virtual Complainant's position in this

regard is also unequivocal as has been mentioned before.

The prosecution has neither attempted to explain this contradiction nor has

adduced any plausible reason as to how or why such contradiction may

have come into existence. The burden to prove the charges beyond

reasonable doubt being on the prosecution, this Court is compelled to

conclude that the prosecution did not have any explanation to offer in this

regard.

In these circumstances this Court cannot think of any basis upon which the

Accused Appellant could have been convicted.

For these reasons this Court decides to set aside the judgment dated 2007-

1 '! 1

09-12, the conviction entered into consequent to it and the subsequent

sentence passed on the Accused Appellant by the learned High Court

Judge.

This Court further directs that the Accused Appellant be acquitted and

discharged from all the charges levelled against him.

We make no order for costs.

Appeal is allowed.
