The said two license holders by Power of Attorney dated i h November 2006( P-2) appointed the

Petitioner to the present application Rajagopal Rajendran as the power of Attorney holder for the

purpose of,

1. To appear before the Commissioner of Excise on all matters connected to the said business

and the said license and make necessary representation on our behalf

2. To appear before the Commissioner of Labour, Labour tribunal or any other forum in respect

of all industrial disputes with the employees of the said business and in matters connected

with the payment of EPF, ETF and payments statuary or otherwise

3. To appear before the Commissioner of Inland revenue and represent all matters connected to

the said business, make payment of business turnover tax, income tax and other payments,

apply for income tax clearance and attend to all necessary formalities with regard to renewal

of the said license annually

4. To make representations on my behalf to all statutory provincial and local authorities in

respect of the said business and the said license

5. To enter into any compromise of disputes differences concerning the said business and the

said license before any of the aforementioned functionaries and authorities and to execute all

necessary writings in our name and on our behalf to give effect to same

6. To appear sue or answer and to receive all process in any action appeal or other judicial

proceedings what so ever in any court concerning the said business and the said license and

generally to act in all such proceedings in any way in which we might if present be permitted

or called on to act

When going through the said Power of Attorney P-2 it appear that the entire management of Udaya

Wine Stores based on the said FL-3, Fl-4 and B-3 licenses had been entrusted to the said Rajagopal

Rajendran by the two license holders. However as revealed before this court the said 1 sl license

holder Liyanage Udenis Silva is not among the living at the time this application was filed before this

court in the year 2014 and the licenses issued to operate Fl-3. Fl-4 and B-3 for the year 2014 was

issued only in the name of Liyanage Charitha.

As further observed by us, the only Power of Attorney before this court is the Power of Attorney

signed in the year 2006 by the two license holders and the Petitioner had failed to satisfy this court

that he is the Power of Attorney holder of Liyange Charitha who is the sole license holder as at 2014.

The fact that the Petitioner was appointed the Power of Attorney holder for both Liyanage Udenis

Silva and Liyanage Charitha will have no bearing in the case in hand since the Power of Attorney

issued by both will come to an end with the death of one grantor. As revealed before us, with the

death of Liyanage Udenis Silva fresh licenses under Fl-3, Fl-4 and B-3 had been issued in the name

of Liyanage Charitha and no Power of Attorney had been granted on the Petitioner by the said

Liyanage Charitha who is the license holder as at 2014.

On 10th February 2014 officers of the Excise Department including the 2nd Respondent had carried

out detection at Udaya Wine Stores No 4 Gouravila Colony Upcot. During the said detection, the

staffs working in the said premises namely Iyakannu Reegan and Subramaniam Mohanraj were found

to be acting in violation of the provisions of the Excise Ordinance and the Regulations made under

the Excise Ordinance. As further revealed before us, Iyakannu Reegan who was physically present at

Udaya Wine Stores was detected when he sold a bottle of Extra Special Arrack 40 Rupees excess of

the marked price and a bottle of beer 50 Rupees excess of the marked price. In addition to the above

the officers have detected a180-ml opened bottle inside the shop in violation of the regulation.

During the said detection, the officers observed a locked room just behind the licensed premises.

Since the said room was locked, the officer requested the sales person at the license premises to open

the door. The sales person after informing that the key to the room is with his manager, had got down

the manager on the request of the investigation officer. When the said room was opened by the

5

manager Mohanraj, who arrived on the request of the sales person, the officers detected1200pened

Arrack bottles packed in 10 crates.

After the said detection, a statement was recorded from the sales person, Iyakannu Reegan at the

same time and another statement was recorded from the manager S. Mohanraj at the Head Office

after getting him down to Colombo on 18.02.2014. After the said statement was recorded the

impugned order X2 was issued to the license holder and it was handed over to the said Mohanraj who

acted as the manager of Udaya Wine Stores at the said inquiry.

However, when the papers were filed before this court by the Petitioner and during the arguments

before us, the Petitioner took up the position that the said Mohanraj was not the manager at Udaya

Wine Stores and he is only a tenant of a room just behind the liquor shop. In support of this position

the Petitioner has submitted before this court a copy of a lease agreement said to have signed between

Liyanage Charitha and Subramaniam Mohanraj with regard to No 11 Gouravila Colony Upcot for a

period of 3 years commencing from 22.01.2012 but there is no proof that No 11 Gouravila Colony

referred to in the said lease agreement refers to the same room found just behind the licensed

premises No 14 Gouravila Colony.

In addition to the above, the Petitioner had produced an affidavit said to have signed by the said

Mohanraj, and according to him, he is referred to by people as "Manager" since he was a manager of

a farm called Green Farm but was never the manager at Udaya Wine Stores. He had further submitted

that the said 120 bottles of Arrack found in his room were collected by him to be given to two of

friends for their weddings.

But in this regard this court is mindful of the fact that none of the said bottles were carrying seals at

the time of the said detection and Mohanraj who collected the bottles had failed to explain as to why

he broke the seals of all 120 bottles found in his room.

6

In their objections filed by the Respondents before this court, the Respondents have produced marked

R-2to R-14, thirteen receipts for the period of 2012 and 2013, where the person who received goods

including bottled toddy, arrack and beer to Udaya Wine Stores, has placed a signature almost similar

to the signature of Mohanraj which is found in the affidavit tendered by him along with the petition.

When considering the matters referred to above, it is clear that one Liyanage Charitha was the license

holder at all times relevant to this application with regard to Fl-3, Fl-4 and B-3 licenses issued to

Udaya Wine Stores No 14, Gouravila Colony Upcot and the violations of the provisions of the Excise

Ordinance and the Regulations made thereunder were taken place at the premises belonging to the

said Liyanage Charitha by the employees employed by the said license holder.

The Petitioner who is before this court namely Rajagopal Rajendran cannot be considered as the

Power of Attorney holder of the said Liyanage Charitha who is the sole licensee for the year 2014 and

in the said circumstances, I hold that the said Petitioner does not have the IOCliS standi to claim any

relief as prayed in the present application.

In the said circumstances, I dismiss the application with cost fixed at Rs. 10,000/-

Application dismissed with cost.
