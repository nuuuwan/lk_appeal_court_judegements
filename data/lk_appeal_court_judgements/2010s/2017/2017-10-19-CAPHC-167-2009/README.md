JUDGMENT

3

P Padman Surasena 1

The Petitioner- Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court of North

Central Province holden at Anuradhapura praying for a writ of certiorari to

quash a quit notice issued by the 1st Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 1st Respondent) under section 3 of the State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act. The said application had also sought a

writ of mandamus to compel the 1st Respondent-Respondent to issue a

permit to the Appellant under section 19(2) of the Land Development

Ordinance, in respect of the same land.

It is the conclusion of the learned Provincial High Court Judge that the

Provincial High Court has no jurisdiction to issue writs on a matter, which

does not fall within the scope of the Provincial Council List (List 1)

At the commencement of the argument of this case, learned Senior State

, Counsel brought to the notice of this Court'that this position of law has

now been decided by the Supreme Court in the case of The

Superintendent, Stafford Estate and two others Vs. Solaimuthu Rasu1

The Supreme Court in that judgment had clearly held that the jurisdiction

conferred on the Provincial High Courts under Article 154 P 4(b) does not

extend to matters in respect of powers relating to recovery/dispossession

encroachment or alienation of state lands since they are not found in the

Provincial Council List (List 1) in the 9th Schedule to the 13th amendment to

the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.

Thus, it is now settled law that the Provincial High Court does not possess

jurisdiction to issue under Article 154 P 4(b) writs of this nature in respect

of matters relating to alienation of state lands since such a subject is not

found in the Provincial Council List (List 1) in the 9th Schedule to the 13th

amendment to the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri

Lanka.

The judgment pronounced by the Provincial High Court in this case is also . .

on the same line. Therefore, this Court proceeds to dismiss this appeal with

1 2013 (1) Sri. L. R. 25.
