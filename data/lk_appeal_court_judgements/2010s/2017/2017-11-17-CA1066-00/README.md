Factual matrix as per the district court case record:

1. The Plaintiff Appellant instituted the case No. 309131P in the

District Court of Gampaha seeking to partition a land called

Nagahawatta alias Nagahalanda containing 1 Acre and 11

perches.

2. Originally only the 1 st Defendant Respondent was disclosed in

the plaint with a pedigree giving shares only to the Plaintiff

Appellant and the 1 st Defendant Respondent and the

2ndDefendant Respondent intervened on 21.11.1988 (Vide

J.E.No.8)

3. After exhibiting public notices in accordance with Section 15 of

the Partition Act (vide J.E.No.8) the preliminary survey was

done on 06.03.1989 that is after the intervention of the 2nd

defendant (Vide plan no. 19/1989 marked as X).

4. The preliminary plan and the report was tendered to District

Court on 24.04.1989 (Vide J.E.No.9 dated 89.04.24.)

5. Though the stance taken by the 2nd Defendant Respondent in his

statement of claim that prayed for a dismissal of the Plaintiff

Appellant's action was that land sought to be partitioned and

surveyed was an undivided portion of a lager land called

-- .

5

Nagahalanda in extent of 9 acres 3 roods and 38 Perches,

neither the 2nd Defendant Respondent nor any person who gets

title to that larger land as per the pedigree in 2nd Defendant

Respondent's statement of claim was present before the

surveyor to show the larger land or to make claims to the

plantation or improvements described in the report to the

preliminary plan (Vide report of the preliminary plan marked

as Xl)

6. Even though the 2nd Defendant Respondent has referred to a

plan nO.24803 dated 08.04.1823 (Marked as 2V3 in evidence),

as a plan depicting the larger land, he has not taken any step to

superimpose that plan on the preliminary plan marked as X to

show that the land sought to be partitioned is part of the corpus

of that plan.

7. The Commissioner in his report marked as X 1 has stated that

he superimposed plan no.139 dated 10/2/1939 (marked as P7 in

evidence) and the land surveyed is the land sought to be

partitioned but the 2nd defendant respondent has not resorted to

section 18(3) (a) of the Partition Act to get the preliminary plan

6

verified or corrected if he was of the view that it was only a

portion of a lager land or the contents of the report is incorrect.

8. The four boundaries of the land depicted in preliminary plan

has been described as follows;

North

East

South

Gam Sabha Road

High way (from Udugampola to Kirindiwita)

Ambagahawatte of A.A.Babasingno

West Nagahalanda of A.S.Peris and others

9. P7, the plan no. 139 made in 10.02.1939 for the land sought to

be partitioned in the plaint and deeds marked by the Plaintiff

Appellant as PI, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6, and P9 have boundaries

with same or similar description.

10. 2V3, the plan depicting the larger land as alleged by the 2nd

defendant respondent does not depict a land called

Ambagahwatta to the south of it and no road way or a high way

is shown anywhere in the said Plan 2V3 either as a boundary or

within the corpus. No facts were placed before district court to

show that the road and highway in X (Preliminary Plan) can

now be found within or as boundaries of the corpus depicted in

7

plan marked 2V3 or any land depicted in plan 2V3 as its

southern boundary is now called as Ambagahawatte.

11. The deed no. 1133 marked as 2Vl shows that the land at the

northern boundary of Ambagahawatta (which seem to be the

southern boundary of the land sought to be partitioned in the

plaint) belongs to one Baba Appu. It can be seen that the

original owner of the 2nd defendant respondent's pedigree is one

Amusinhage Baba Appu (vide statement of claim and 2 V 4)

12. There is no evidence placed before the district court to show

that Baba Appu mentioned in 2 V 1 as the owner of the land to

the north of Ambagahawatte is one and the same Amusinhage

Baba Appu referred to in 2V 4 as well the land belongs to Baba

Appu mentioned in 2 VI as the northern boundary is the alleged

larger land N ahahalanda referred to in the statement of claim of

the 2nd defendant respondent.

13. Plan No.139 marked P7 had been made on 10.02.1939 III

respect of the land called Nagahawatta depicted therein and

registered under the Rubber Control Ordinance and boundaries

of P7 are compatible with the boundaries of the land sought to

f

1

,

8

be partitioned in the plaint and depicted in preliminary plan

marked X.

14. There are deeds written, from 1943 onwards, for a land called

Nagahawatta having the same extent and boundaries similar to

the land sought to be partitioned in the Plaint(vide P8, PI toP6)

15. It is only in the last deed of the Plaintiff Appellant's pedigree,

namely deed No. 27250 marked as P6, the land is described as

Nagahawatta alias Nagahlanda and otherwise it has been always

referred to as Nagahawatta of 1 acre and 11 perches in extent in

other deeds marked by the plaintiff. Only in the preliminary

plan marked as X the extent is given as 1 acre 13.771 perches

indicating an increase of 2.771 perches. It can be also noted

boundaries of P7 (Plan No 139) made in 10.2.1939 are

compatible with the schedules of Nagahawatta or Nagahawatta

alias Nagahalanda referred to in the deeds tendered by the

Plaintiff to prove his pedigree (vide PI - P8) ,

16. Land sought to be partitioned by the Plaintiff appellant IS

registered in the land registry as a land of 1 acre and 11 perches

under the name Nagahwatta and entries in the land registry

f I

r: I f l

{ I! I I Ir t f [ , t1,

t

commenced in 1959. (Vide extracts taken from land registry

marked as P9.)

17. The 2nd defendant respondent's deeds describe a land called

Nagahalanda of 9 aces 3 roods and 38 Perches. Though the 2nd

defendant respondent has tendered the deeds relating to the

alleged larger land called Nagahalanda, some of which written

in as far back as 1870 and 1916, none of them refers to a land

called Ambagahwatta as its southern boundary.

18. Even the 2nd defendant respondent in his evidence dated

1.10.1999 at pages 3 to 9 has admitted the existence of a 1

acre and 11 perches land named Nagahawatta of which the

Plaintiff Appellant has Y2 share.

19. After the trial, the Plaintiffs case was dismissed as prayed for

by the 2nd defendant respondent on the reason given in the

judgment dated 18.10.2000.

It is clear from the judgment of the district court that the learned

district judge has not given due consideration to many of the facts

highlighted above in this judgment.

10

As per the Learned District Judge's Judgment he has taken the view

that the land sought to be partitioned is a part of a larger land.

Following seem to be the reasons for his conclusion.

1. The existence of a land called Nagahalanda as the western

boundary of the land sought to be partitioned by the Plaintiff.

2. The description of the land in P6 as Nagahawatta alias

Nagahalanda on the request of Plaintiff Appellant where in PI to

P5 it is described as Nagahawatta.

3. The case in the district court has been filed after a short period of

time of the execution of P6 (It seems Learned district judge has

suspected Plaintiffs move to name the land as Nagahawatta alias

Nagahalanda was to use it in a litigation that was going to be

instituted).

4. The reference in 2VI to 2VI4 of the defendant respondent's

pedigree to a separate land called Nagahalanda (On this the

Learned district judge has come to the inference that whatever

the existence of Nagahawatta alias Nagahalanda, in truth there is

a land called Nagahalanda in Asgiriwalpola village and in PI to

P5 the name Nagahawatta has been mentioned for the land

named Nagahawatta alias Nagahalanda)

11

5. There is no reference to a land called N agahawatta alias

Nagahalanda in any of the deeds other than P6 which was

executed less than two years prior to the institution of the action.

(On this learned district Judge seems be have come to the

inference that there is no evidence to prove the existence of a land

called N agahawatta alias N agahalanda.

Analysis

In a village even adjoining separate lands may have the same names.

For example, a large land that existed many decades ago may become

separate lands with separate identity by long prescriptive possession

by its co-owners or outsiders. They may use the same name for the

separate portion they acquired by prescription.

Therefore, the corpus surveyed for the district court case and depicted

in the preliminary plan cannot be said forming part of alleged larger

land called Nagahalanda merely because one boundary (namely the

western boundary) found in preliminary plan is called N agahalanda.

On the other hand if the land in preliminary plan is part of alleged

larger land Nagahalanda, Ambagahawatta found in preliminary plan

to the South of its corpus should be a boundary to the larger land

-.

12

called Nagahalanda but no deed, Plan (2V3) or schedule to the 2nd

defendant respondent's statement of claim describe the southern

boundary of the alleged larger land including Ambagahwatta as a

boundary to it, no evidence was led to show any connection of the

description of southern boundary in 2nd defendant respondent's deeds

and plan marked 2V3 (i.e. gardens of Anthony Appu and Hathanhamy

etc.) to Ambagahwatta found in preliminary plan as the Southern

boundary. Citing of land belongs to Baba Appu as the Northern

boundary of Ambagahwatta in deed No. 1133 (2Vl) is not sufficient

to prove that land surveyed in preliminary plan is part of Nagahalanda

without any proof to show that said Baba Appu is the same Baba

Appu referred to as the original owner in 2nd defendant respondent

pedigree and the name of the land described therein as the Northern

boundary is N agahalanda.

Mere inclusion of the name Nagahalanda and description of the land

as Naghawatta alias Naghalanda in deed marked P6 and filing of the

district court case less than a lapse of two years will not prove any

dishonest behavior of the plaintiff. Actually, when all deeds previous

to P6 describe the land as Nagahawatta, on his request the name

'Nagahalanda' was mentioned in the description of the land in the

13

schedule to P6 to his detriment. If the Plaintiff Appellant restrained

himself from describing the land as Nagahawatta alias Nagahalanda

and stick to the same schedule in P I to P5, there is no nexus what so

ever to the alleged larger land called Nagahalanda. In this back drop

it is difficult to accept the view of the learned district judge that

naming of the land as Nagahawatta alias Nagahalanda was to use it in

litigation as plaintiff appellant has not claimed from Nagahalanda.

The plaintiff appellant might have started to describe the land in that

manner due to other reason such as usage in actual practice even

though not used in any deed prior to P6.

The Learned District judge has come to the inference that there is a

separate land called Naghalanda in Asgiriwalpole village due to the

fact that name is referred to in deed marked 2Vl to 2VI4. Even

though this court cannot find fault with that inference, there was no

evidence to show that the name Nagahawatta was mentioned in PI to

P5 for the land called Nagahalanda or for the land called Nagahawatta

alias Naghalanda as inferred in the following quoted passages of the

Judgment of the learned district judge.

14

Though the learned district judge, at page 5 of his judgment, has come

to the inference that the name N agahawatta has been mentioned for

the land called Nagahawatta alias Nagahalanda in deeds marked as PI

to P5, quite contrary to that, at page 6 of his judgment he has come to

the conclusion that there is no definite oral or documentary evidence

with regard to a land called Nagahawatta alias Nahahalanda and that

only fact clearly represented by those evidence is that there are two

separate lands called N agahawatta and N agahalanda.

15

Only land revealed in evidence as Nagahawatta is the land which is

described in plaintiffs deeds marked PI to P5. If it is a separate land

as found by learned district judge in his judgment at page 6, it should

be the same land found in P6 as extent and boundaries are compatible

with the extent and boundaries of the land described in PI to P5. On

the other hand, the donor of P6 has referred to his title as deriving

from P5. Therefore, it is crystal clear that P6 refer to the same

separate land called Nagahawatta that is found in deed PI toP5. What

facts placed before the district court proves is that the Naghawatta

alias Naghalanda of 1 acre 11 perches referred to in the plaint and P6

is the same land described as Naghawatta in PI toP5. If it was part of

alleged larger land Naghalanda naturally co- owners as per the 2nd

defendant respondent's pedigree should have taken an interest to

claim before the surveyor since the preliminary survey was done after

exhibiting public notice as per section 15 of the Partition Act. No one

16

else other than plaintiff appellant and 1 st defendant respondent has

claimed before the surveyor. Not even the 2nd defendant respondent

came forward to claim improvements and plantation in the land

surveyed. It should be noted that the preliminary survey was done

only afterthe2nd defendant respondent intervened to the case.

X2, the report to the preliminary plan clearly show that the

improvements and plantations were claimed only by the plaintiff

appellant and the 1 st defendant respondent and the 2nd respondent

appellant has not taken any steps under section 18(3) of the Partition

Act. Therefore, the facts mentioned in the preliminary plan and the

report becomes evidence without any further proof. Even though the

2nd defendant respondent has cross examined the surveyor, the claims

to the plantation and improvement have not been challenged by the

2nddefendant respondent. There is plantation aged 40-50 years among

the plantation claimed by the plaintiff appellant and the 1 st defendant

respondent proving that the plaintiff appellant, the 1 st defendant

respondent and their predecessors were in very long procession of

about 40 to 50 years in the land surveyed in the preliminary plan.

When those facts if evaluated by the district judge together with the

dates of P7, P8 and entries in P9, the learned district judge could have

~ ...

:' ,. .... ,

17

easily come to the conclusion that the plaintiff appellant, 1 st

defendant respondent and their predecessors were in long exclusive

possession of the land sought to be partitioned at least since 1939 as

there was no evidence to show that anyone in the 2nd defendant

respondent's pedigree had possession of that land during that time.

As per the decision in Tillakaratne Vs Bastian 21 NLR 12 the

learned district judge could have presumed prescriptive title of the

plaintiff appellant and 1 stdefendant respondent and their predecessors

to the land to be partitioned and surveyed and identified in the

preliminary plan, even if it is presumed to be a part of a larger land in

the past. (It is pertinent to note that there is no clear and definite

evidence to prove that the land surveyed for the preliminary plan is

part and parcel of a larger land at any given time in the past.)

It is true that the burden to prove the identity of the corpus was with

the plaintiff appellant who filed the partition action in the district

court. He has fulfilled that burden as follows:

a) By marking a plan depicting the corpus which was made in

1939.

(Vide P7) and getting it superimposed on preliminary plan

marked as X.

....

.. ...

,

18

b) Marking the folios of land registry where the corpus has been

registered as a separate land with relevant entries commencing

from 1959. (Vide P 9)

c) Marking the deeds written to the corpus from 1943 onwards.

(Vide P 9, PI to P6 and 2Vl)

d) Marking the preliminary survey report X 1 to show only the

parties who gain title according to Plaintiff appellant's pedigree

has claimed improvements and plantation before the

commISSIOner.

Under such circumstances, the evaSIOn from taking steps to

superimpose the plan marked 2V3 while having it with him by the 2nd

defendant respondent should have been considered as causing an

adverse inference under section 114 of the evidence ordinance. Close

perusal of the boundaries ofP7, P8, PI to P6 and X Preliminary plan

show that all of them are for the same land.

It is clear from P7, P8, P9 and PI to P5 that there exists a land called

Nagahawatta of 1 Acre 11 perches with a separate identity at least

from 1939 onwards. It is also clear P6 relates to the same land though

l !

.. . ' .. --I . 19

the plaintiff appellant has instructed to name it as N agahawatta alias

N agahalanda in P6.

This court has no doubt that the same land is depicted in X, the

preliminary plan though it shows an addition of negligible 2.7 perches

to its extent. Even if it is considered for the sake of argument that the

land sought to be partitioned would have formed a part of a larger

land in the past, there are enough facts to consider and presume that

plaintiff appellant, 1 st defendant respondent and their predecessors got

title by long prescriptive possession to the land sought to be

partitioned and depicted in preliminary plan marked X.

The pedigree shown by the plaintiff is proved by the deeds PI to P6

and 2 V 1. The claims to the improvements and plantation reported in

X 1 were not challenged during the trial.

For the forgoing reasons this court is of the view that the learned

district judge erred in not taking into consideration what is relevant

and taking into consideration what is not relevant.

Therefore, this court decides to set aside the judgment of the learned

o district judge dated 200.10.18 and direct the district judge to partition ,.. ". the land depicted in preliminary plan as per the prayer in the plaint

20

and the district judge is further directed to decide the rights to

improvements and plantation as per the claims made before the

surveyor. The Plaintiff Appellant is entitled to the cost of this appeal.
