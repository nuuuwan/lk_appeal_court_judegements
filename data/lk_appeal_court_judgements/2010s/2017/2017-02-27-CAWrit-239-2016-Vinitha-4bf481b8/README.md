The petitioner of the present application Vinitha Malkanthi

Hulangamuwa had come before this Court against the decision by the Debt

Conciliation Board which is produced before this Court marked 'N'.

According to the facts placed before this Court the 1 st respondent,

See1awthie was the owner of two blocks of land which were adjacent to each

other in Nedimala-Dehiwala. According to the petitioner, she is a bona fide

purchaser of a block of land to the extent of 24 perches she purchased from

one Dharmawathie. After three years of the said purchase she was noticed

by the Debt Conciliation Board and she had faced an inquiry by the said

Debt Conciliation Board. However during the inquiry at the said Debt

Conciliation Board, the 1 st respondent to this application, See1awathie

2

revealed that the only transactions she had was with the petitioner

Hulangamuwa, even though Hulangomuwa had denied the same.

According to Seelawathie she was in the habit of mortgaging the two blocks

of land when she need money to various persons. At once stage when she

mortgaged the 14 perches block to one Nimali Madeshika and in order to

get the said mortgage discharged, she had mortgaged balance 24 perch

block to Mrs. Hulangamuwa who is the petitioner to the present application.

According to the evidence of Seelawathie she had never mortgaged the

property to a person by the named Dharmawathie and her position was that

the said Dharmawathie is a fictitious person. She only admits signing blank

papers before a lawyer and obtaining a loan from Mrs. Hulangamuwa. As

observed by this Court the two transactions referred to by the petitioner as

evinced by the documents produced marked Band C have taken place

within a period of three months. The amount referred to in both

transactions are the same as Rs: one million for the value of a block of land

to the extent of 24 perches at Nedimala, Dehiwala. The Debt Conciliation

Board was mindful of the two transactions referred to above when they

concluded that the transactions before them were not transfers but

mortgages. Even though the petitioner to the present application claimed

that she is a bona fide purchaser, the person from whom she brought the

said property was not summoned to given evidence to support her position.

Since the amount referred in both the said deeds appears to the same

amount, this Court too cannot understand the purpose of the sale between

Dharmawathie and Hulagamuwa without making any profit. Even the

stamp fees spent by Dharmawathie had not been recovered by her. When

.. 3

considering the submissions before this Court and also considering the

decision of the Debt Conciliation Board which is before us marked 'N', this

Court is of the view that the Debt Conciliation Board had reached the said

decision after carefully analysing the evidence available at the inquiry

before them and therefore we see no reason to interfere with the findings of

the Debt Conciliation Board. Therefore this Court is not inclined to issue

notices in the present application. We therefore dismiss this application.
