The learned counsel for the petitioner submit that the 1 st to 8th

respondents have entered in to a partition deed disregarding the dismissal

of the partition action tried in the district court of Galle between the same

parties. The counsel's contention is that the court has decided that the

parties to have failed to established tittle and therefore writing a partition

deed among the same parties of that action is a contempt of court.

We do not agree with this submissions. In the partition action court

has decided that the parties have failed to establish their tittle. If doesn't

mean that if the parties have any tittle, it has been erased. If the parties

believe that they have title and if they are in such terms that they can enter

in to an amicable partition the dismissal of a partition action will not bar

them in entering into an amicable partition deed.

The petitioner in this case was an intervenient in to the said partition

action on the basis that his land was also included in to the partition

action. If the petitioner's rights have been infringed by the respondents by

entering in to this amicable partition deed, he has to go for civil litigation

to vindicate his rights. We refused to issue notice and dismissed this

application.
