The Plaintiff - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant)

filed action by plaint dated 30.03.1979 in the District Court of Balapitiya

against the Defendant- Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Respondents) to partition the land described in the schedule thereto.

The Trial commenced and evidence was led on behalf of the parties and

interlocutory decree was entered into on 26.06.1985. As per the interlocutory

decree the Appellant was allotted 9/10th share of the corpus and the 5th

Defendant was allotted 1I10th share of the corpus.

Thereafter a commission was issued in respect of the corpus and on or about

07.11.1990 Plan bearing No. 1105 was tendered to Court. Both the Appellant

and the 5th Defendant objected to the said plan and the Appellant proposed an

alternative scheme of partition bearing No. 284 and the 5th Defendant proposed

an alternative scheme of partitions bearing Nos. 3141 and 3141 A.

After a lengthy inquiry into the most suited scheme of partition the learned

District Judge delivered order dated 14.06.1996 in favour of the scheme of

partition proposed by the 5th Defendant i.e. No. 3141 and ordered that the final

scheme of partition be prepared according to Plan bearing No. 3141

aforementioned.

The final plan bearing No. 2361 dated 22.01.1997 was prepared and the final

decree was entered into on 25.08.l997. Being aggrieved by the said final decree

the Appellants preferred this instant application.

At the outset it is evident that the Appellant is contesting the final decree of the

leaned Trial Judge dated 25.08.1997 and not the order dated 14.06.1996

delivered in respect of the alternate scheme of partition. It is apparent that the

Appellant took no steps to challenge the order dated 14.06.1996, within the

prescribed period, which forms the basis of the instant Appeal by which Plan

bearing No. 248 was rejected by the learned District Judge. The said plan

depicting the scheme of partition preferred by the Appellant was rejected by the

learned District Judge, having carefully considered the alternative schemes of

partition proposed by both parties and giving adequate reasons for such

rejection. Further, it is clear that steps were taken in the original Court

stemming from the said order dated 14.06.1996 and as a result Plan No. 2361

dated 23.01.1997 was prepared by Licenced Surveyor Rabin Chandrasiri. It is

only after these subsequent steps and consequent to the final decree that the

Appellant has invoked the jurisdiction of this Court.

The Appellants main contention is that as the "lion share" owner, in that, since

he was allotted 9/10th share of the corpus, he was entitled to the road frontage as

depicted in Plan No. 284. However, it is prudent to note that the learned District

Judge has carefully considered this contention at the scheme inquiry by order

dated 14.06.1996 and rejected same.

The Appellant could have preferred an appeal under Section 36A of the

Partition Act to challenge order dated 14.06.1996 but he has failed to do so.

Section 36A of the Partition Act reads thus;

Any person dissatisfied with an order of the Court made under section 36,

may prefer an appeal against such order to the Court of Appeal, with the

leave of the Court of Appeal first had and obtained.

Therefore I concur with the contention of the 5th Defendant that the present

application is belated and hold that this Court cannot consider the merits of this

application and as such the instant appeal is dismissed, without costs.

Appeal dismissed.
