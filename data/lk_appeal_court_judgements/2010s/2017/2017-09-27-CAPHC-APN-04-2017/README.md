At the Production inquiry/ the Petitioner and the Ac~used gave evidence.

Although the Accused pleaded guilty to the charges/ at the inquiry he denied that

he had the knowledge of having Cannabis Sativa. Further it was revealed that he

has pending cases.

The Accused in his evidence at the inquiry stated that he borrowed the vehicle

from his brother/ the Petitioner in this case around 7.30 in the morning and the

brother was sleeping. The petitioner had asked the Accused to get keys from

where it was hung inside the room and further asked him to return the vehicle

safely.On his return journey home from Embilipitiya/ he had offered a lift to a

friend who wanted transportation of 'Ganja/ to an Ayurveda Centre at Beliyatte.

In the case of K. Mary Matilda Silva Vs I.P. Habarana, it was held that /I the order of confiscation cannot be made if the owner proves to the satisfaction of court "

{1} that he has all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of the offence or

{2}that the vehicle has been used for the commission of the offence without his know/edgeN

The Petitioner has the burden to prove on a balance of probability that he has no

knowledge and that he took all necessary steps to prevent the offence being

committed. When considering his evidence in the High Court he had only asked

the Accused to return the vehicle safely. Therefor it is apparent that the

Petitioner has not taken precautions or necessary steps to prevent an offence

being committed by his brother who borrowed the vehicle. Further the Petitioner

was unable to prove on balance of probability that he has no knowledge of the

offence being corn,-c,itted by his brother.

In any case the circumstances mentioned above do not constitute exceptional

circumstances to urge this court to invoke the Revisionary Jurisdiction.

Thus there is no ground to reverse the order of the Learned High Court Judge,

affirming the order of the learned Magistrate in confiscating the Vehicle bearing

Registered No. SP/ PE 1214.

Revision Application is Hereby Dismissed without costs.
