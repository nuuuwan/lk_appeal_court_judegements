This is an appeal from the High Court of Kurunegala.

The Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the

Appellant) was an employee of the 2nd Respondent Respondent Society as a

store keeper. It has been found that there was a shortage of money and

3

goods in the stores. Later the Appellant was served a charge sheet and

disciplinary action taken against him. The shortage was presented to an

arbitrator for inquiry to recover the amount from the Appellant. The

arbitrator held that the Appellant was not liable to pay. Being aggrieved, the

2nd Respondent Society (hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the

2nd Respondent) appealed to the 1 st Respondent Respondent Commissioner

of Cooperative Development and Registrar. (Hereinafter sometimes called

and referred to as the 1 st Respondent) The 1 st Respondent set aside the order

of the arbitrator and held that the Appellant is liable to pay Rs. 269,037.80.

The Appellant filed an application for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

certiorari to quash the order of the 2nd Respondent in the High Court of

Kurunegala. The learned High Court Judge after inquiry dismissed the

application. Being dissatisfied, the appellant presented this appeal.

The argument of the Appellant is that the 2nd Respondent considered the

document marked PI5 without calling the author to give evidence and the

findings in the said P 15 are based on assumptions and not on the actual facts

and figures. The learned High Court Judge has considered this aspect in

length and found that the figures in the document are based on the records

available at the Society. The learned High Court Judge has found a few

discrepancies in P 15 but has come to the conclusion that they do not vitiate

the entire document. I do not see any reason to interfere with this finding.

This is an application for a writ, not an appeal against an order of the 1 st

Respondent. Correction of errors cannot be done in an application for a writ

unless there is a violation of natural justice or acted in ultra vires. In the

present case the 1 st Respondent has the statutory power to hear the appeal

and he has acted within his power. He has given a hearing to the Appellant

before making the decision. There is no violation of natural justice or ultra

VIres.

Administrative Law by Wade Ninth Edition at page 250 it says that:

The same distinction sometimes expressed in terms of the liberty to

err. It is inherent in all discretionary powers that it includes the

power to decide freely, whether rightly or wrongly, without liability to

correction, within the area of discretion allowed by the law. The

principle was clearly expressed long ago by Holt CJ, who spoke of

this diversity, (viz.) that if the commissioners had intermeddled with a

thing which was not within their jurisdiction, then all is coram non

judice, and that may be given in evidence upon this action; but 'tis

otherwise if they are only mistaken in their judgment in a matter

within their con usance, for that is not inquirable, otherwise than upon

an appeal.

The present case is not an appeal against the order of the 1 st Respondent, it

is an application for a prerogative writ to quash the said order. The appellant

has failed to establish ant violation of natural justice or the decision is ultra

VIres.

Under these circumstances, I do not see any reason to interfere with the

findings of the learned High Court Judge.

The appeal is dismissed subject to costs fixed at Rs. 10,0001-
