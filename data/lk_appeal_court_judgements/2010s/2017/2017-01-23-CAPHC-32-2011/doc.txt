These are appeals from the High Court of Kegalla.

The Respondent Petitioner Appellant (the Appellant) was charged

under the Urban Development Authority Act before the Magistrate Court of

Warakapola for constructing a building without obtaining the relevant

permit from the Pradeshiya Sabha. While this case is pending, the Appellant

instituted action in the Court of Appeal seeking for a writ of certiorari and

mandamus against the Petitioner Respondent Respondent (the Respondent).

When the case was called before the learned Magistrate on 03.08.2007, the

Counsel for the Respondent informed Court that there is a case pending

before the Court of Appeal and for the time being he does not intend to

proceed the application. The learned Magistrate considered the submission

and fixed the case to be called on 07.09.2007. On that day the Respondent

submitted a copy of the proceeding in the Court of Appeal and informed that

there is no order to stay the proceedings in the Magistrate Court.

Accordingly the learned Magistrate proceeded and concluded the

application and issued the demolition order. The Appellant moved in

reVISIOn as well as appealed against the decision in the High Court of

Kegalla, was dismissed. These appeals are against the said orders.

3

When these matters were taken up for argument on 20.06.2016, the

Appellant was absent and unrepresented, the Counsel for the Respondent

agreed to dispose the argument by way of written submissions. The Counsel

though obtained several days to file written submissions, without filing the

same kept himself absent on 13.09.2016. The Court issued notice on both

parties and in response to the said notice, both parties appeared through their

Counsel in Court 03.10.2016 and moved for further time to file written

submissions. On 30.11.2016 it was recorded in the journal entry that "Both

parties have filed their written submissions in respect of the preliminary

objection, there is no right of appeal." Until that day, no preliminary

objection is recorded in the journal entries. In the written submissions of the

Respondent also there is no preliminary objection fonnulated. Therefore I

will consider the merits of these appeals. These two appeals are being on the

same issue this judgment is for both cases.

The Appellant argue that the application filed by the Respondent in

the Warakapola Magistrate Court case no 40355 is under the Pradeshiya

Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987 and the sections referred in the application, that is

sections 8 I (1) and 28 A (3) has nothing to do with the unauthorized

construction. This is a totally misconceived argument. The Respondent has

not made the application under the Pradeshiya Sabha Act, but the

application was made under the Urban Development Authority Act No. 41

of 1978 amended by Act Nos. 4 of 1982 and 44 of 1984. The section 28 A

(3) of the Urban Development Authority Act reads thus;

(3) (a) Where any person has failed to comply with any requirement

contained in any written notice issued under subsection (1) within the

time specified in the notice or within such extended time as may have

been granted by the Authority, the Authority may, by way o/petition

and affidavit, apply to the Magistrate to make an Order authorizing

the Authority to-

4

(a) to discontinue the use of any land or building;

(b) to demolish or alter any building or work;

(c) to do all such other acts as such person was required to do

by such notice, as the case may be,

and the Magistrate shall after serving notice on the person who had

failed to comply with the requirements of the Authority under

subsection (1), if he is satisfied to the same effect, make order

accordingly.

The Respondent has issued notice under section 28 A (1) to the

Appellant but the Appellant without responding to the said notice, continued

to construct the building. Therefore the Urban Development Authority is

entitle to proceed under section 28 A (3) of the Act. The area where the

construction was done by the Appellant was declared as a Development

Area by the Gazette Extraordinary No. 1140117 dated 12.07.2000. The

Chairman and the Secretary of the Pradeshiya Sabha of Warakapola has

been authorized by the Urban Development Authority to perform the

functions under the Act by letters dated 31.12.1991 and 28.02.2003.

Therefore, the Chairman has the authority to institute this action. On the

other hand section 8(1) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act No. 15 of 1987

empowers the Chairman to act on behalf of the Pradeshiya Sabha. The

section reads thus;

8. (1) The Chairman of a Pradeshiya Sabha shall be the chief

executive officer of the Pradeshiya Sabha, and all executive acts and

responsibilities which are by this Act or any other written law

directed or empowered to be done or discharged by the Pradeshiya

Sabha may, unless the contrary intention appears:; from the context,

be done or discharged by the Chairman.

5

Therefore the argument of the Appellant that the Chairman cannot

institute this action cannot stand.

The appellant's main argument in the petitions of appeal is that the

submission of the Counsel for the Respondent in the Magistrate Court made

on 03.08.2007 that "for the time being he is not proceeding the application"

amounts to a withdrawal of the application and the learned Magistrate

without giving a further date, should have dismissed the application. He

argues that the Court has no jurisdiction to hear and conclude the case after

the Counsel submitting that he is not proceeding.

I do not agree with this submission. The learned Magistrate has

recorded in the journal entry dated that the Respondent is not proceedingfor

the time being. (~~e:DC) It does not mean that the Respondent is not

proceeding at all. The Respondent has come to know that there is a case

pending before the Court of Appeal and brought it to the notice of the

Magistrate Court. It is obvious that his intention was not to proceed with the

case only until he obtains a copy of the proceeding in the Court of Appeal

because he has tendered the said copy to the Magistrate Court on the very

next date and obtained permission from Court to proceed. Therefore the

word "for the time being" (~~e:DC) used in the journal entry is very crucial.

The Appellant's argument is that the words used in the said journal

entry dated 03.08.2007 amounts to a withdrawal of the application. A

complainant in a Magistrate Court cannot withdraw an application in that

manner. Section 189 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that the

withdrawal can be done only with the permission of the Court. The section

reads;

189. If a complainant at any time before judgment is given in any

case under this Chapter satisfies the Magistrate that there are

sufficient grounds for permitting him to withdraw the case the

Magistrate may permit him to withdraw the same and shall thereupon

acquit the accused, but he shall record his reasons for doing so;

In the present case the learned Magistrate has not permitted the

complainant to withdraw the case. Therefore there cannot be any implied

withdrawals, it has to be express and clear withdrawal with permission of

Court.

It has been held in the case of Ramachandran v. The Queen 64 NLR 512

referring to a withdrawal of indictment that;

If what learned Crown Counsel purported to do at the trial was to

seek the permission of the Court and with its permission withdraw the

indictment, then the learned District Judge should have made order

staying all proceedings on the indictment and discharging both

accused.

The learned Magistrate has correctly decided that since no stay order

has been issued by the Court of Appeal, the application can be proceeded. I

see no reason to interfere with this finding.

Appeals dismissed subject to costs fixed at Rs. 10,000.00
