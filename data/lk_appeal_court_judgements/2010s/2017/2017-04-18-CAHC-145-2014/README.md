The Accused - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant)

was indicted in the High Court of Hambanthota in case No. HC 278/2007 by

indictment dated 06.06.2007 on the following counts;

01) That on or about 10th of November 1998 the Appellant committed the

offence of kidnapping Supun Shanaka Guruge who was less than 16 years

of age at the time from the lawful guardianship of Naotunna Palliyaguruge

Upali in Thaligala located within the jurisdiction of this Court, an offence

punishable under Section 354 of the Penal Code.

02) That on the same day, at the same place and in the same transaction the

Appellant committed the offence of Grave Sexual abuse on Supun

Shanaka Guruge by sexually gratifying himself by placing his genitals

close to the genitals of the said victim and thereby committing an offence

punishable under Section 365 (b) (2) of the Penal Code as amended by

Act No. 22 of 1995 and Act No. 29 of 1998.

The indictment was read over to the Appellant on 27.04.2011 and the

Appellant pleaded not guilty to the aforementioned chargers and the trial

commenced against him.

After the establishment of the High Court of Tangalle the High Court of

Hambanthota case bearing No. HC 278/2007 was transferred to the High

Court of Tangalle as case bearing No. T.H.C. 56/2007.

The victim Supun Shanaka Guruge (PWl), his mother K.K. Kanthi (PW2),

Police Constable Premadasa (PW 4), Sub-Inspector Sarathchandra (PW5)

and Dr. R.K. Somasiri (PW 6) gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution

and the Appellant gave evidence on his behalf by a dock statement on

02.04.2013 denying the charges levelled against him in his Defence.

The learned High Court Judge of TangaUe pronounced judgment on

23.06.2014 and convicted the Appellant on both chargers aforementioned

and sentenced the Appellant as follows;

1 st Count - 4 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 10,0001- and

a default term of 6 months simple imprisonment,

2nd Count - 10 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 10,000/-

and a default term of 6 months simple imprisonment.

The case for the prosecution in brief was that the victim was around the age of 8

years when the alleged incident occurred and on the day in question he was sent

by his mother to the nearby boutique which was located about 100 meters from

his house to buy Panadol. On his way back from the boutique the Appellant,

who was known to the victim, had taken him near a tamarind tree and forced the

victim to lie down on the ground and had allegedly pulled down the victims

shorts and the Appellant had come on top of him and thereafter had placed his

genitals on the thighs of the victim and performed a sexual act. After the said

incident the victim has run home and told his mother (PW2) about this incident.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant contends that the victim does not

remember what actually happened to him and that the victim takes up

contrasting positions when giving evidence before and after Court was

adjourned for lunch.

I shall now consider the strength of the evidence of PW1, the victim of the

alleged grave sexual abuse. Throughout the witness testimony of the victim it is

clear that the victim states that he was young when the alleged incident took

place and that he cannot remember specific details surrounding the said

incident. When the victim was cross examined the Defence marked as VI a

contradiction of evidence relating to identifying the Appellant by his name soon

after the incident to his mother (PW2) whereas the victim has stated in cross

examination that he merely described the alleged perpetrator to his mother.

It is submitted on behalf of the State that the victim had difficulty in narrating

the incident in question and such should be excused since the victim was of a

tender age (8 years) at the time of the alleged incident and that his testimony

was led only 13 years later (when the victim was 21 years old).

The learned Counsel for the Appellant contends that when the complainant has

presented two versions in evidence such evidence needs to be corroborated with

other evidence. Considering that soon after the alleged incident the victim

informed his mother (PW2), she would then be the best person to corroborate

the evidence of the victim.

Before considering the evidence of the victim's mother (PW2) I shall first

consider if it is necessary to corroborate the evidence of the victim in light of

the relevant precedent.

In the case ofR Vs. Dharmasena 58 NLR 15 held that that;

'In a charge of rape, it is not in law necessary that the evidence of the

prosecutrix should be corroborated'

Basnayake, C.l was of the view that;

'The principal submission made on behalf of the first appellant was that

the learned trial Judge failed to direct the jury that as against him there

was in law no corroboration of the evidence of the prosecutrix. We are

unable to uphold this submission as in our view the story of the

prosecutrix was corroborated in several respects. Our Penal Code does

not require that the evidence of the prosecutrix in a charge of rape should

be corroborated although it does provide that in the case of charges of

procuration under section 360A no person shall be convicted upon the

evidence of one witness, unless such evidence be corroborated in some

material particular by evidence implicating the accused. Another such

provision is to be found in the Maintenance Ordinance. There is no

presumption, as in the case of an accomplice, that a prosecutrix in a case

of rape is unworthy of credit unless she is corroborated in material

particulars. Except where corroboration is expressly required by statute,

I

I I I i ! I I ! I

our rule of evidence [Evidence Ordinance, Section 134. illiam Crocker,

17 Cr. App. R. 45.] is that no particular number of witnesses shall in any

case be required for the proof of any fact.'

A different approach was adopted in the case of Premasiri Vs. The Queen 77

NLR 86in which it was held that;

'In a charge of rape it lS proper for a jury to convict on the

uncorroborated evidence of the complainant only when such evidence is

of such a character as to convince the jury that she is speaking the truth.'

In the case of Karunasena V s. The Republic 78 NLR 63 it was held that;

'in a charge of this nature(rape), a proper direction would have been to

tell the jury that it is not safe to convict a person on the uncorroborated

testimony of the prosecutrix but that the jury, if they are satisfied with the

truth of Her evidence, may, after paying attention to that warning,

nevertheless convict.'

Similarly in the case of Sunil & another V s. The Attorney General 1986 (1)

SLR 230 it was held that;

'It is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of a woman

victim of a sex offence but if her evidence is convincing such evidence

could be acted on even in the absence of corroboration. '

In the recent case of Ajith Vs. The Attorney General 2009 (1) SLR 23 Sisira de

Abrew J quotes a passage from Dr. Glanville Williams book: Proof of Guilt, 3rd

Edition pages 158 and 159 states that;

'On a charge of rape and similar offences it is practice to instruct the jury

that it is unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the alleged

victim. The rule applies to a charge of indecent assault, or any sexual

offence, including an unnatural offence between males. There is a sound

reason for it, because these cases are particularly subject to the danger of

deliberately false chargers, resulting from sexual neurosis, phantasy,

jealousy, spite or simply a girls refusal to admit that she consented to an

act of which she is now ashamed.'

His Lordship further states that;

'I hold that it is very dangerous to act on the uncorroborated testimony of

a victim of a sexual offence. However, if the Court can without any

hesitation, accept and believe that the story narrated by her is true then

the Court can act on such evidence even without corroboration. I would

like to state here that Court, in cases of rape, as a rule of prudence

normally looks for corroboration of her testimony in order to satisfy its

conscience that she is telling the truth. '

E. R. S. R. Coomaraswamy, in his treatise, The Law of Evidence, Volume II,

Book 2, p 625 argues that corroboration is needed 'where a witness is neither

wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable' and is required in three sets of

circumstances: (i) Where it is expressly required by statue, (ii) By rule of

practice (developed by the Courts), and (iii) Sometimes on the facts and

circumstances of the particular case.

Therefore, in cases where the evidence of a victim of grave sexual abuse is

neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable such evidence should be

corroborated.

In light of the above this Court is of the view that the evidence of the victim's

mother (PW2) is material and essential to the instant case.

Having considered the concise evidence of PW2 (vide pages 77 - 84) it is clear

that the victim has only informed her that the Appellant had grabbed the victim

/

;

!

/

! . 8

and that the Appellant had held the victim and embraced him after which the

victim had freed himself and run away. It is prudent to note that nowhere in her

evidence does she state that the victim had informed her of the alleged act of

grave sexual abuse. In cross examination she confirms the fact that the victim

only informed her that the Appellant had attempted to embrace the victim and

thereafter the victim had freed himself and run away (vide page 83 of the

Appeal Brief).

In relation to the above the learned Senior State Counsel submits that "human

witnesses cannot be expected to testify like tape recorders and are likely to omit

or forget details when testifying after a considerable passage of time". This

Court cannot agree with this view in the instant case since PW2, a material

witness, has omitted the very act complained of in her evidence.

Therefore this Court is of the view that the learned High Court Judge has

misdirected himself in fact when he found that the victim (PWl) had given clear

evidence about the act of grave sexual abuse allegedly perpetrated by the

Appellant and that the same was corroborated by the testimony of PW2, the

victim's mother.

Further, it is prudent to note that PW2' s evidence reveals an inconsistency

relating to when the alleged incident was complained to the Police. The alleged

incident occurred on 10.11.1998. In evidence PW2 states that the victim

informed her of the alleged incident on the same day and that she delayed going

to the Police directly since her Husband (PW3 whose evidence was not led) was

not at home and that after her husband returned she informed him of the alleged

incident and that she complained to the Police on the next day i.e. 11.11.1998

(vide page 82 of the Appeal brief). However the evidence ofPW4 and PW5 (the

Police Officers) reveal that the complaint was only made on 12.11.1998 two

days after the alleged incident. PW2 does not provide any explanation as to why

9

the alleged incident was not reported to the Police after her Husband was

informed. It seems that the victim's parents complained of the said incident only

after the attack on their house on 11.11.1998 when they lodged a complaint

relating to the said attack.

In fact PW5 confirms in evidence that the statement given by the victim's

father, one Upali, on 12.11.1998 does not contain any mention of the alleged act

of grave sexual abuse perpetrated on his son by the Appellant but only contains

a description of the attack on his house on 11.11.1998 (vide page 112 of the

Appeal brief). Since there was no mention of the alleged act of grave sexual

abuse in his statement the said Upali was not called to give evidence in the

instant case although he was named as PW3 (vide page 137 of the Appeal

brief). This Court finds that an omission of this nature by the victim's father is a

serious lapse on his part which exposes inconsistencies in the case for the

prosecution.

I shall now consider the evidence ofPW6, the Judicial Medical Officer Dr. R.K.

Somasiri, who marked the Medico - Legal Report as PI also dated 12.11.1998.

PW 6 admits in evidence that owing to a lapse on his part the 'short history

given by the patient' does not reveal any particulars about the alleged incident

but only that the victim was subject to sexual abuse (vide page 93 of the Appeal

brief). He further admits that the said 'short history given by the patient' section

is incomplete (vide page 95 of the Appeal brief).

Therefore this Court finds that the evidence of PW6 does not sufficiently

corroborate the narration of the prosecution with cogent evidence and that the

learned High Court Judge has erred in concluding to the contrary.
