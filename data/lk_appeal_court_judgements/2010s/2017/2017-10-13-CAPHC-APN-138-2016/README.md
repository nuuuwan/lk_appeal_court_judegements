ORDER

P Padman Surasena J

This Court has already decided this case and pronounced its judgment on

2017-06-14.

However a motion was filed thereafter on behalf of the Accused Petitioner

to support an application for rel~sting on the basis that he was not heard as

there had been no appearance for him on the date this Court had decided

this case.

It is to be observed that the instant case is a revision application filed to

invoke the jurisdiction vested in this Court by virtue of Article 138 of the

Constitution read with provisions in chapter XXIX of the Code of Criminal

procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. Section 366, a section in that chapter

governs the rights of audience of parties in a revision application. It has

provided that a party has no right to be heard either personally or by

pleader before the Court of Appeal when exercising its powers of revision.

Thus, it is not open for the Petitioner to claim an entitlement of such a

right. In any case, the cause as to why the Accused Petitioner did not

make submissions before this Court is not attributable to this Court.

This Court in the judgment it pronounced on 2017-06-14 has considered

the merits of this application and therefore, it is not open for this Court to

re-consider its own judgment.

The judgment of the Supreme Court in Jinadasa and another V Sam Silva

and others1 submitted by the learned President's Counsel for the Accused

Petitioner does not support his application. In any case, that was not an

instance where the Court had considered the merits before the order of

11994 (1) Sri. L R 232.

dismissal. It is an appeal from an order of the Court of Appeal re-listing an

application it had dismissed when the said application was not supported

on the date appointed for it. Despite this, the Supreme Court for the

reasons set out in that judgment had held in that case that the Court of

Appeal was in error in setting aside the order of dismissal and ordering

reinstatement of the said case in its list.

In these circumstances, we decide to refuse the application for relisting.

The judgment dated 2017-06-14 pronounced by this Court must remain

valid.
