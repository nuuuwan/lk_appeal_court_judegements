This is an application to revise and set aside an order made by the

learned High Court Judge of Thanglle directing the Registrar of that Court

6

to frame charges against the Petitioners under section 18 of the Judicature

Act for contempt of Court.

The facts are briefly as follows. The Petitioner Respondents filed an

application in the High Court of Thangalle seeking for several writs

including a writ of mandamus compelling the 1 st 2nd and 3rd Respondent to

hold the election of the Thangalla Multi Purpose Cooperative Society Ltd.

On 22nd February 2017, when this case came up before the learned High

Court Judge, the Counsel for the 2nd Respondent informed Court that the

election would be held on 5th March. Though he made such a statement,

without obtaining permission of Court or at least without bringing to the

notice of Court, the election scheduled to be held on 5th March was

postponed indefinitely. Thereafter the Petitioner Respondents filed an

affidavit requesting Court to take action for contempt of Court. The learned

High Court Judge, after a brief inquiry, not being satisfied with the

explanation offered, directed the Registrar of the Court to frame charges for

contempt of Court against 1 st to 6th Respondents. The Respondent

Petitioners in this application seeking this Court's intervention to set aside

the said order of the learned High Court Judge directing the Registrar to

frame charges.

At this stage this Court need not to consider whether the charge of

contempt of Court is proved or not, because so far no charge is framed. The

Court has to consider only whether there is material to frame a charge of

contempt of court.

The idea of filing the writ application was to compel the relevant

authorities to hold the election of the Thangalla Multi Purpose Cooperative

Society Ltd. The statement made by the Counsel for the 2nd Respondent that

the election would be held on the 4th March is directly related to the issue of

this action.

7

The Counsel for the Petitioner in this application argues that the said

statement is not an undertaking given to Court or is not an order of Court.

Therefore contempt of Court proceedings cannot be instituted for violating

or not following the statement made on 22nd February. The learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner Respondents' contention is that the

interim application in the main case has not been preceded because of the

statement made in Court by the 2nd Respondent that the election would be

held on 5th March. Therefore it amount to an undertaking to Court. The

learned Counsel for the 1st and 2nd Respondents argument is that the

statement made on the 22nd February is a "mere statement" made by the

Counsel.

It is a fact that the Counsel for the 2nd Respondent made a statement

to Court that the election would be held on the 5th March. As I pointed out,

one of the main reliefs prayed in the writ application is to compel the

relevant authorities to hold the election. The officer who is responsible of

holding election informs court that the election would be held on a certain

day. Even though he made such a statement in Court, without informing

Court, he decided to postpone the election and did so. If he has not made

such a statement to Court, the Petitioner Respondents would have made an

application for interim relief. By making a statement that the election would

be held, the Petitioner Respondents were prevented from making the

application for interim relief. Under these circumstances the statement made

by the 2nd Respondent that the election would be held on 5th March had a

weight and the parties had acted on it. It is not a "mere statement". No one

can make a "mere statement" in Court without responsibility. There is

material to frame a charge of contempt of Court. It is for the trial judge to

decide on evidence whether the charge is proved or not.

The Counsel for the Petitioner presented another argument that the

Petitioners had to act on the direction of the superior officers and therefore

they cannot be held liable for contempt of Court. It is also a matter for the

trial judge to decide on evidence. The evidence will reveal the culpability of

the Petitioners. It is too early for this Court to come to a finding on a fact

where the evidence has not yet been led.

Under these circumstances, I see no reason to issue notice.

Notice refused. The application dismissed
