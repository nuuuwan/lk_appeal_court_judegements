Learned Counsel heard in submissions. Counsel for the

Petitioner Mr. Anil Silva, P.C. submits that he is seeking relief under

Section 46( 1) d of the Judicature Act. Counsel submits that the

Petitioner is practicing as an Attorney-at-Law and there is alleged

charge against her that she has made threatening call to the Registrar

of the Magistrate's Court of MaHakam. Considering the facts and

submissions of the Counsel for the Petitioner, the Petitioner claims that

she is "feared" that she will not get a fair trial at the Magistrate

Court of MaHakam because the Complainant is the Registrar of the

said Court. The Senior State Counsel appeanng for the State, submits

that she has no objections.

Considering available facts, the Petitioner was asked

to come to the Police Station by the O.l.C. and she refused to

present herself to make a statement. Even though the Police could have

proceeded under Section 109 of the Criminal Procedure Code to

issue a warrant, they were respectful for the Petitioner because she is

an Attorney-at-Law practicing in the Northern province. The Police

had to seek the assistance of the Court to record the statement of the

Petitioner and she made a statement, next Court appearance date was

informed and she was made aware of the next date but she was not

present in Court. We do not find any notice or summons. The

Magistrate on the request of the Investigating Officer issued a

warrant. On the following date, i.e 13.09.2016 the Petitioner presented

herself through a President's Counsel and the warrant was recalled.

She was bailed out and asked to be present on the next date namely

11.10.2016. On that day, she was absent and unrepresented and there

was no explanation for absence for that date. Warrant issued again

and she presented her self on a subsequent date and the warrant was

recalled. Absent on the second date was not explained in the petition

and affidavit. Considering all available materials, we find that there is

no allegation against the judicial officer. This application does not

qualify under Section 46 of the judicature act. Therefore this Court is

not inclined to transfer the matter. If the Petitioner wishes they can

inform the Judicial Services Commission of the allegations.

The Registrar is directed to send a copy of this

proceedings to the Secretary of the Judicial Services Commission. The

application is dismissed. No costs.
