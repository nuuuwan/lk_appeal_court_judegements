The Accused Appellants along with one B.A Jayathissa were indicted in

the High Court of Colombo under three counts.

(1) Under section 140 of the Penal Code

(2) Under section 296 read with section 146 of the Penal Code

(3) Under section 296 read with section 32 of the Penal Code.

The Appellants were convicted for the 1st count and were imposed 6

months of imprisonment and a fine of Rupees 5000/- carrying a default

term of six months for the 1st count.

Death sentence was imposed for the 2nd count. This appeal is from the

said conviction and the sentence.

The story of the prosecution is that on the day in question, the deceased

along with witness Chaminda Perera had proceeded to the CWE to

purchase some provisions around 9.30 am. Thereafter, the deceased had

walked about fifteen feet ahead of the witness and had crossed the road.

The witness was prevented from crossing the road by a van which

passed him. The witness had seen the Appellants among the assailants.

The witness had seen the Appellants attacking the deceased with knives.

The case for the prosecution rests or falls on the evidence of the sole

eye-witness Chaminda Perera.

Witness Chaminda Perera stated that the Appellants were known to him

for 15-16 years and has categorically stated that he identified the

Appellants on the day in question.

The medical evidence suggests that the deceased was attacked with more

than one weapon.

Therefore, the Medical evidence corroborates with the evidence of the

sole eye-witness.

The incident has taken place during broad day-light and the eye-witness

had known the Appellants for nearly 20 years. This in-fact establishes

the identification of the Appellants by the witness.

There has been an incident in which a bomb has been thrown which fact

proves the motive of the killing.

The defence of Alibi taken up by the 1st Accused-Appellant cannot be

considered since they have not given notice on the defence of Alibi to

the prosecution as provided for in section 126 (A.) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act.

(1) No person shall be entitled during a trial on indictment

In the High Court, to adduce evidence in support of the

defence of an alibi, unless he has,

(2)

a) Stated such fact to the Police at the time of his making

his statement during the investigation; or

b) Stated such fact at any time during the preliminary

Inquuy; or

c) Raised such defence, after indictment has been served,

with notice to the Attorney General at any time prior to

fourteen days of the date of commencement of the trial;

Provided however, the Court may, if it is of opinion that

accused has adduced reasons which are sufficient to show

why he delayed to raise the defence of alibi within the

period set out above, permit the accused at any time

thereafter but prior to the conclusion of the case for the

prosecution, to raise the defence of alibi.

Cv-The original statement should contain all suh

" information as to the time and place at which such person

Page4of7

claims he was and details as to the person if any, who may

furnish evidence in support of his alibi.

(3) For the purposes of this section "evidence in support of

an alibi" means evidence tending to show that by reason of

the presence of the defendant at a particular place or in a

particular area at a particular time he was not, or was not

likely to have been, at the place where the offence is alleged

to have been committed at the time of the alleged

commISSIon.

The Evidence Ordinance, on the burden of proof as to particular fact

further stipulates:

"103. The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on that

person who wishes to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by

any law that the proof of the fact shall lie on any particular person.

Illustrations

A prosecutes B for theft, and wishes the court to believe that

B admitted the theft to C. A must prove the admission.

B wishes the court to believe that, at the time in question, he

was elsewhere. He must prove it."

It was held in State of Haryana Vs. Sher Singh, AIR 1981 SC 1021:

1981 SC Cr R 317: 1981 Cr LJ 714: (1981) 2 scc 300 that the plea of

alibi taken by the accused, it is he who has to prove it.

The evidence of the sole eye-witness has not been shaken by

contradictions or omissions and therefore the Appellants cannot claim

that they were not given a fair hearing by the High Court Judge.

Although the Appellants advanced the argument that the dock statements

of the Appellants have not been considered by the learned High Court

Judge, on a perusal of the Judgment (at page 132) we find that the

learned High Court Judge has considered the dock statements.

Moreover, the dock statements of all the Appellants, by themselves, fail

to raise any doubt on the un-contradicted evidence of the eye-witness.

This court finds that the Learned High Court Judge has analyzed the

evidence applying the several tests and has come to the correct

conclusion.

For the foregoing reasons, this court moves to affirm the judgment dated

11.09.2007 and dismiss the Appeal.
