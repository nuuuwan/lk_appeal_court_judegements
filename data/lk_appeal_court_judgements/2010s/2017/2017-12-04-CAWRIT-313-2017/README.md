Order

A.L. Shiran Gooneratne J.

We have heard Counsel representing both parties to this application.

When this Petition was taken up for support both parties consented to all

Petitions connected to this Application (CA writ Nos. 314117, 315117,316117 and

317/17) to be taken up together as all the Petitioners are employees of the

University of Visual and Performing Arts. with similar grievances and complaints

and the relief sought are identical and therefore to abide by one decision.

The Petitioner has filed Petition dated 3 rd October 2017, pleading inter alia,

a) to issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing the

order of dismissal made against the Petitioner shown in Final order

(P 34) andl or any other document/s incidental thereto;

b) to issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari quashing any

decisions taken by anyone or more of the Respondents to suppress

the Petitioner of the post of lecturer as reflected in the document

marked (P 06);

c) to issue a mandate III the nature of Writ of Mandamus on the

Respondents to appoint the Petitioner to the post of lecturer to

implement the decision of the selection committee dated on or

around OS-OJ-2011, together with consequential entitlements

thereto:

Paragraph 7 of the Petition refers to circular No. 166, where the Petitioner

states,

"that he was recruited to the University by following the same procedure

applicable to Lecturers under Section 7f1..LQ[the University Ordinance as per the

Circular 166 dated 06-04-1982 by the UGC (P 06)."

The Petitioner states that the said circular No. 166 is marked P 05. However

document marked P 05 is an undated document titled "approval by the University

Grants Commission at its loih meeting held on 4th and 5th March 1982."

Accordingly document marked P 05, has absolutely no reference to a Circular No.

166 dated 06-04-1982, as pleaded. Document marked 'P 06' is an internal

communication dated 19-03-2013, to the Head of faculty of the University of

Visual and Performing Arts from the Assistant Registrar of the said University.

Paragraphs (V) and (VII) to the prayer refers to a letter dated on or

around 05-01-2011 as per Circular No. 166. It is observed that the Petitioner with

no precision or accuracy of the date of the decision of the selection committee. has

sought to implement such decision to have the Petitioner appointed to the post of

lecturer. It is also observed that a letter dated 05-01-2011 is not pleaded or

produced to Court together with the Petition. other than a reference made to it in

the prayer to the Petition. Therefore paragraphs (IV), (V) and (VII) to the prayer of

the Petition are devoid of preciseness and therefore inconsistent with the

averments contained therein.

In Siriwardena vs. Provincial Public Service Commission (2012 BLR)

Vol. XIX - Part II Ani! Gooneratne, J held,

"The other aspect is about the uncertainty of the remedy. It is

important to correctly plead the relief sought. One should never

have a vague prayer. As far as possible there should be

reference to the order or decision to be quashed. Court should

not be called upon to supply the omission. Specific relief should

be pleaded with certainty. "

Therefore due to the said uncertainty in the Petition, the Court cannot grant

the substantive relief prayed for by the Petitioner.

Writ Remedies, Justice B.P. Banerjee, 6th Edition at page 127, states,

fjI

"Writ petitions are decided on the basis of statements on

affidavit. If the petition contains misleading, inaccurate

statements or there are suppression of material facts, the

Court will not entertain the petition. "

In the circumstances we refuse notice.

Petition is dismissed without costs.

This decision applies to CA writ Nos. 314117,315/17,316117 and

317117.
