L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from the High Court of Galle.

The parties were absent and unrepresented at the argument of the

appeal. They were noticed several times but not responded. The Court

received a letter purported to be send by the Respondent stating that he is

unable to attend Court due to his ill health and financial restrains that he

is facing and moved Court to proceed to deliver judgment. The Appellant

did not respond at all.

The Complainant Petitioner Appellant (the Appellant) filed first

information in the Magistrate Court of Udugama under section 66( 1) (b)

of the Primary Court Procedure Act as a private plaint on a land dispute

threatening breach of the peace. After filing the affidavits, documents and

written submissions the learned Magistrate held that the Respondent

Respondent Respondent (the Respondent) was in possession of the land

in dispute on the date of filing the first information and ordered that the

Respondent is entitleal to possess. Being aggrieved by the said

determination the Appellant moved in revision in the High Court of Galle

where the order of the learned Magistrate was affirmed. This appeal is

from the said order.

The first information was filed in the Magistrate Court on 24th

May 2007 stating that the possession of the land was with the Appellant

and the Respondent was disturbing possession. The Appellant prayed for

an order to prevent the Respondent from disturbing the possession of the

Appellant. The Appellant came to Court on the premise that he was in

possession of the land on the date of filing the first information.

He has made a complaint to the police on 10.02.2007 stating that

his labourer Y.M. Sirpala was chased out by the Respondent and when he

went to see the situation he was also threatened to assault with a knife.

Thereafter he says that "I went home". This is a clear dispossession of the

Appellant by the Respondent on 10.02.2007.The Appellant has not taken

any action against it but has just gone home. There is no any evidence to

show that the Appellant possessed the land thereafter. The Appellant

made another complaint on 05.05.2007 stating that the Respondent had

pruned about 3000 tea bushes. Pruning tea bushes is an essential step in

tea cultivation.

The Appellant's own statements to the police establish that the land

in dispute was in possession of the Respondent at least from 10.02.2007

and continued even on 05.05.2007. The first information filed on

24.05.2007. The Appellant had failed to establish that he was in

possession on the date of filing of the first information.\

I see no reason to interfere with the finding of the learned High

Court Judge.

The appeal dismissed without costs.
