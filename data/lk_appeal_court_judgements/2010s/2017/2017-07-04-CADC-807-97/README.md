The Plaintiff - Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Plaintiff) instituted

action in the District Court of Colombo by plaint dated 30.11.1988 praying inter

alia for a declaration of title in respect of an allotment of land which at present

was allegedly unlawfully occupied by the Defendant - Respondent (hereinafter

referred to as the Defendant) and damages of Rs. 10,000/- per mensem till

vacant possession thereof was delivered to the Plaintiff.

The corpus was identified further to a commission issued by Court as Lot. Olin

plan bearing No. DC/C/5-91dated 15.03.1992 prepared by Licensed Surveyor

I. G. W. Fernando.

The case in brief for the Plaintiff is that the original owner of lot 4 in Plan No.

349A dated 26.06.1955 containing in extent 8 acres and 20 perches by virtue of

Deed bearing No. 4808 dated 17.07.1955 was the Plaintiffs father one H.Y.

Punchisingho Satharasinghe. It IIf J (

The said land was thereafter allegedly vested in the Land Reform Commission

with the enactment of the Land Reform Law No. 01 of 1972 under the

provisions of Section 14(2) and that the land described in the 2nd Schedule to the

Plaint was given to the Plaintiff and that by letter dated 17.06.1988 that the

Commission instructed the Plaintiff to execute Deed in his name for the said

portion of land and as such that Deed bearing No. 1773 dated 17.06.1998 was

executed in favour of the Plaintiff.

The Contention of the Plaintiff is that although the ownership of the property

morefully described in the 1 st schedule to the Plaint vested with the Commission

as aforementioned the Defendant had come to possess the aforesaid Lot 1 which

forms a part of the land morefully described in the 1 st schedule to the Plaint by

virtue of Deeds bearing No. 2527 dated 14.03.1980, Deed No. 2838 dated

25.05.1981 and Deed No. 2895 dated 07.09.1981.

The Plaintiff contends that the said Deeds are void and that by letter dated

1710.1988 sent on behalf of the Plaintiff by his Attorney-at-Law the Plaintiff

requested the Defendant to vacate the corpus aforesaid but that the Defendant

continued to occupy the corpus unlawfully.

The case for the Defendant in brief as pleaded in Answer dated 31.03.1993 is

that the Plaintiffs father, the said H.V. Punchisingho Satharasinghe was the

original owner of the lager extent of land as averred by the Plaintiff but however

that the said land was not subject to the Land Reform Commission since it was

not agricultural land and the land was used to obtain clay for the manufacture of

tiles and bricks and that there were large pits on the land from where the clay

was removed. The Defendant contends that after the demise of the said H.V.

4

Punchisingho Satharasinghe the title of the larger extent of land devolved on the

lawful issues of the said H.Y. Punchisingho Satharasinghe in equal shares of 1/8

(including the Plaintiff) and that thereafter the Plaintiff and three other children

of the said H.Y. Punchisingho Satharasinghe had by the said Deeds bearing No.

2527 dated 14.03.1980, Deed No. 2838 dated 25.05.1981 and Deed No. 2895

dated 07.09.1981 respectively transferred their rights to the Defendant.

The position that the Defendant is in possession of the said land on the strength

of the aforesaid Deeds is not disputed by the Plaintiff but however maintains

that the said Deeds are void.

The Defendant's position is that on an application of the principle "exception rei

vindication et traditae" the title of the corpus should vest on the Defendant since

the Plaintiff had conveyed all his rights to the Defendant by virtue of said Deed

bearing No. 2838 and effectively the rights and entitlements of the Plaintiff

under Deed bearing No. 1773 dated 17.06.1998 would ensure to the benefit of

the Defendant.

The Defendant further preferred a counter claim against the Plaintiff for a

compensation award of Rs. 5,000,0001- for the buildings constructed by the

Defendant for his industry further for a declaration that the Defendant remains

possession of the Corpus until the said sum is paid by the Plaintiff.

The Plaintiff filed replication dated 28.04.1993 denying the claim of the

Defendant for compensation on the grounds that the said improvements were

made by the Defendant were mala fide and that by the said Deed No. 2838 it

was only agreed to convey what would devolve on the Plaintiff by the Land

5

Refonn Commission and that the Defendant had fraudulently caused a transfer

of rights to himself.

Trial commenced on 29.09.1993 and the parties recorded two admissions i.e.

that the larger extent of land was owned by the said H.V. Punchisingho

Satharasinghe and further admitted deeds bearing No. 2527 dated 14.03.1980,

Deed No. 2838 dated 25.05.1981 and Deed No. 2895 dated 07.09.1981. The

Plaintiff thereafter raised issues 1 - 5 and the Defendant raised issues 6 - 16.

The Plaintiff gave evidence on his behalf and marked documents PI - P3 and

closed his case. The Defendant gave evidence on his behalf and marked

documents VI - V4 and closed his case.

The learned District Judge by order 10.10.1997 dismissed the case of the

Plaintiff on the basis inter alia;

a) No witness has been called by the Land Refonn Commision to estatblish

that deed bearing no No. 1773 dated 17.06.1998 marked as P2 was

prepared on the basis of a detennination under Section 14(2) of the Land

Refonn Law,

b) The position that the Plaintiff didn't know he was signing the Deed of

transfer No. 2838 dated 25.05.1981 (VI) could not be accepted,

c) The Plaintiff has failed to produce copies of the application under Section

14(1) of the Land Refonn Law,

d) The Plaintiff has failed to prove that the land was in fact vested in the

Land Refonn Commission.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Plaintiff preferred this instant appeal

on the grounds morefully described in the Petition of Appeal dated 19.12.1997.

This Court shall now consider whether the Plaintiff has proved his case on a

balance of convenience. At the outset the salient weakness of the Plaintiffs case

must be noted, inter alia;

a) The Plaintiff admits that the Plaintiffs father the said H.V. Punchisigho

Satharasinghe had not made a declaration to the Land Reform

Commission as required by law,

b) The Plaintiff in his evidence states that he willingly signed Deed bearing

No. 2838 dated 25.05.1981 but ,however that he merely intended the said

Deed as an agreement to sell and not a deed of transfer although the title

and the wording of the said deed clearly indicate that it was in fact a Deed

of Transfer,

c) Although the Plaintiff makes reference to letters and decisions of the

Land Reform Commission same has not been tendered to Court and as

such remains unproven,

d) No officers from the Land Reform Commission were called in support of

the Plaintiff s contention.

It is for these reasons inter alia that the learned Additional District Court Judge

found that the Plaintiff has failed to prove his case and therefore dismissed the

case.

This Court takes the view that the Plaintiff has failed to prove inter alia that he

had obtained the corpus from the Land Reform Commission and therefore that

the learned Trial Judge has correctly analysed the evidence presented in Court

and arrived at the correct findings.

As such I see no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned Additional

District Judge and therefore affirm the said judgment dated 10.10.1997 and

dismiss the instant appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
