h) Issue a mandate in the nature of writ of Prohibition on the Respondents prohibiting the

Respondents from taking any steps against the Petitioner based on the findings of the said

court of inquiry and the decision of the then Army Commander contained in "P3"

When the application was supported before this court on 12.10.2015, the learned counsel who

appeared for the Petitioner, in addition to the notices on the Respondents had moved for an interim

relief as prayed in paragraph (b) and (c) to the Petition.

This court after considering the submissions placed by the learned counsel had decided to grant

interim relief as prayed in paragraph 'C' only to a limited period but the said interim relief was

extended time to time and is in operation until this order is delivered.

The Petitioner was commissioned to the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force on or about 2ih June 1986

in the rank of 2nd Lieutenant and was holding the substantive rank of "Lieutenant Colonel" and

temporary rank of Colonel at the time the present application was filed before this court.

The Petitioner was attached to the Sri Lanka Light Infantry Regiment and was serving between 2007-

2009 at the 22nd Division in Trincolalee and between 2010-2015 at the 68th Division in

Pudukuduirippu.

As revealed before this court, the Petitioner was granted leave to go to Kandy in his official vehicle

g.~.49290 and on 1st October 2010 around 1.30 am he left the Pudukuduirippu Army Camp in the

said vehicle along with his buddy, Corporal Wasantha Karunathilake, Driver Corporal

Bandaranayake, Soldier Lance Corporal M.K.A. Nilantha and reserve Driver Corporal Bandara. Their

vehicle was searched at Medawachchiya Military Police Check Point at 6.00 am and during the said

search, Military Police had recovered several items said to have stolen or abundant goods collected

from the operational area.

Subsequent to the said recoveries the inmates of the said vehicle were placed on open arrest,

including the Petitioner and an inquiry was conducted by the Military Police.

During the search operation and the subsequent investigations conducted by the Military Police the

items recovered were identified under 4 persons custody, including the Petitioner and since the

inmates including the Petitioner were acting in violation of the instructions issued by the Security

Forces Headquarters Wanni dated 17.01.2009 and 11.02.2009 (R1 and R2), a Court of Inquiry under

the Army Court of Inquiry Regulations 1952 was convened. As observed by this court the said Court

of Inquiry was convened to decide on several matters referred to in the said convening order

including to make recommendation as to what steps should be taken to those who were responsible

for transporting un authorized goods.

Even though the convening order, statement made by the Petitioner before the Court of Inquiry and

the findings of the Court of Inquiry are produced by the Respondents along with the statement of

objection filed by the Respondents, the entire proceedings of the Court of Inquiry is not before me to

consider the procedure adopted by the Court of Inquiry when recording evidence. It was submitted on

behalf of the Petitioner that,

a) The president of the Court of Inquiry, the 2nd Respondent was not present at the COl when the

proceedings were taken place,

b) The Petitioner was not present when the other witnesses were called and he was not given an

opportunity to cross examine the witnesses.

However at the conclusion of the Court of Inquiry the said Court of Inquiry had recommended

disciplinary action against the inmates including the Petitioner as follows,

The said recommendation was made by the Court of Inquiry on 291h November 2011 and the lSI

Respondent as the Commander of the Army, after considering the report of the Court of Inquiry had

decided to produce the Petitioner before the Coronel of the Regiment and to be warned and thereafter

to compulsorily retire from the Army.

Even though the said decision of the lSI Respondent was not immediately implemented considering

the redress of grievance (ROG) submitted by the Petitioner, this court is not interested in considering

several steps taken thereafter, but will only consider the said decision of the lSI Respondent which

was to be finally carried out, was made according to the provisions of the Army Act and the

regulations made there under.

As revealed before this court, the said opinion of the lSI Respondent was reached only after a Court of

Inquiry convened under the provisions of the Army Courts of Inquiry Regulation 1952.

Regulation 2 of the Army Courts of Inquiry Regulation 1952 reads thus,

"Court of Inquiry means an assembly of officers or of one or more officers together with one or more

warrant or non- commissioned officers, directed to collect and record evidence and if so required, to

report or make a decision with regard to any matter or thing which may be referred to them for

inquiry under this regulations"

Regulation 162 of the said regulation further reads thus,

"Every Court of Inquiry shall record the evidence given before it, and at the end of the proceedings it

shall record its findings in respect of the matter or matters into which it has assembled to inquire as

required by the convening authority."

The effect of the findings of a Court of Inquiry was discussed in the case of Boniface Perera V. Lt,

6

General Sarath Fonseka and others CA Writ Application 705/2007 (CA minutes dated 10.09.2009)

by Anil Goonarathne J as follows,

"This court having considered the case of either party is of the view that proceedings before a Court

of Inquiry in terms of the Army Act is a preliminary step prior to a proper trial, which is more or less

a fact finding inquiry to collect and record evidence and to submit a report. On receipt of such Court

of Inquiry proceedings or report, the Commander of the Army could decide whether to initiate formal

disciplinary proceedings by a Court Material or Summary Trial in terms of provisions of the Army

Act. Court of Inquiry proceedings on the basis of terms of reference issued regarding allegation

against the officer concerned. There are no formal charges framed. Therefore based on the Court of

Inquiry proceedings it would not be within the purview of the 151 Respondent to impose any

punishment as in the case in hand.

It is essential that a person concerned should be tried on formal charges and no punishment could be

imposed prior to framing formal charges at a legally constituted Court Material or Summary Trial. As

such any decision to punish based on the Court of Inquiry proceedings would be illegal and ultra

vires the provisions of Army Act."

In this regard this court further observe the provisions of section 40 of Army Act which discusses the

cause of action available when a person subject to the Military Law is accused of an offence and

taken into custody,

i) Take steps for the trial of that person by a court martial

ii) Where a person is an officer of a rank below that the Lieutenant Colonel or is a warrant

officer, refer the case to be delt with summarily by the Commander of the Army or by

such officer not below the rank of Colonel as may there to be authorized by the

Commander of the Arm y.

iii) Where that person is a Soldier other than a warrant officer, deal with the case summarily.

As revealed before this court, subsequent to the Court of Inquiry held against the Petitioner and

several others including @0/9t)00519 Corporal Karunathilake ClC).Cl@.C)~.9 (@05) ~.~.O).(5), (vide

the recommendation referred to above in the judgment) a summary trial was held and on the

recommendations of the said summary trial Corporal Karunathilake was demoted to the rank of

Lance Corporal over the same incident.

The above conduct of the Respondents have clearly indicated the cause of action available when the

findings of a Court of Inquiry is available and as revealed, in the Case in hand, the Respondents have

failed to use the same yardstick against the Petitioner to hold a disciplinary inquiry as recommended

by the Court of Inquiry. In this regard my attention was further drawn to the provisions of sections 42

and 45 read with 133 of the Army Act, where a person subject to the Military Law could only be

punished either consequent to a summary trial or a court martial.

In the case of K.S. Fernando V. Sarath Fonseka andfour others CA Writ 1826/2006 (CA minutes

dated 10.09.2008) the validity of a finding of a Court of Inquiry and the provisions of section 133 of

the Army Act was discussed by W.L.R. Silva J as follows;

"The Court of Inquiry appointed by the Commander of Armed Forces was to collect and record

evidence in respect of a complaint made by the complainant against the accused-Petitioner. The Court

of Inquiry Regulations have been marked as lR3. It is to be noted that section 133 of the Army Act,

prescribes how punishment could be imposed on an accused. According to that section punishments

could be imposed only upon the decision of a court martial .... "

When considering the matters referred to above it is clear that the decision referred to in P8 and P9

based on the finding of the lSI Respondent in P3 was reached without following the relevant legal

provisions of the Army Act and therefore the said decisions have been made ultra vires.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General raised an objection for granting any relief as claimed by the

Petitioner on the ground of lashes but this court is not inclined to uphold the said objection since this j: , l court observes that the Petitioner has sufficiently explained his delay before this court.

t

t

For the reasons referred to above this court decides to grant the relief as claimed by the Petitioner in

paragraphs (d) and (e) but refrain from making any relief as claimed by the Petitioner in paragraphs

(t) and (h) to his petition. Question of issuing a writ of Prohibition as claimed by paragraph (g) will

not arise since the decisions referred to in P8 and P9 have already been quashed by this court. I
