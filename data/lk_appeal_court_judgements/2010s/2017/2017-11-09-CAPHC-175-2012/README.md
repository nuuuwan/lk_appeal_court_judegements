JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for both the Parties, when this case came up on 2017-08-

02 before this Court, agreed to have this case disposed of, by way of

written submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral

submissions. They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment

after considering the contents of their written submissions. Therefore, this

judgment would be based on the material adduced by parties in their

pleadings and their written submissions.

The Petitioner - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

. . referred to as the Respondent) had issued a notice on the Respondent -

Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant),

in terms of section 4 of the Urburn Development Authority Law No. 41 of

1978 as ameJlded by Act No.4 of 1982 and Act No. 44 of 1984 (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the UDA Act).

As the Appellant had failed to comply with the directions issued on him by

the said notice, the Respondent had thereafter made an application in the

Magistrate's Court of Galle under section 28 A (3) of the UDA Act seeking a

mandatory order to demolish the building allegedly constructed unlawfully

by the Appellant.

Learned Magistrate having afforded an opportunity for the Appellant to

show cause, had after an inquiry, pronounced the order dated 2010-09-16

granting authority to the Respondent under section 28 A (3) to demolish

the said unlawful construction.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate, the

Appellant had made a revision application to the High Court of Galle.

The High Court of Galle after hearing parties, had by its judgment dated

2012-11-29 had proceeded to dismiss the said revision application

affirming the learned Magistrate's order.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this

Court.

Learned counsel for the Appellant has advanced two arguments in the

written submissions he had filed. They are as follows;

i. that the Appellant is entitled to challenge the quit notice issued upon

him

ii. that the Provincial High Court erred when it held that no exceptional

circumstances had been placed before it by the Appellant.

At the outset, it must be stressed here that in this case there is no quit

notice issued on the Appellant by the Respondent. Thus, it is an irrelevant

argument and the said argument has no application to the instant case.

Perusal of the judgment of the Provincial High Court shows that the

absence of exceptional circumstances is not the only ground upon the said

revision application had been refused. Indeed, reading the said judgment

as a whole, makes it clear that the learned provincial High Court Judge had

refused the said application because he had found no merit in the said

application.

The Appellant has not established that he had not contravened the relevant

provisions of UDA Act as amended. Indeed the written submissions filed on

behalf of the Appellant is silent on that issue.
