This is an appeal filed by the John Keels Holding PLC

against the determination of the Tax Appeal Board of Review

dated 30th March 2010. The questions of law formulated in this

appeal are as follows:-

1. Did the Board of Review err in law in failing to determine

that the sum of Rs,35,846,409.00 arising on the sale of

Treasury Bills held by the Appellant in the Secondary

3

Market constitutes' Capital Gains' in accordance with the

provisions of the Inland Revenue Act No.28 of 1979 as

amended (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') and was

therefore exempt form income tax by virtue of section 14(1)

(a) (xxii) introduced by the Inland Revenue Act No.35 of

1993 ?

2. Did the Board of Review err in law in determining the said

gain of Rs.35, 846,409.00 on the sale of Treasury Bills held

by the Appellant in the Secondary market as a combination

of Capital Gains amounting to Rs. 51,317 and interest

amounting to Rs.35,795,092 ?

3. Did the Board of Review err in law in failing to hold that

the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue , was not

justified in determining the appeal applying one source of

income i.e. Trade, based on his reasons, which was entirely rI, different from the source of income i.e. interest, based on

treasons stated by the Assessor, to justify his assessment?

II

The appeal relates to the years of assessment 1994/ 1995.

The contention of the Appellant is that the Board of Review has

acted contrary to express Provisions of Section 14 (xxii) of the

Inland Revenue Act No. 28 of 1979 as amended by Act No.35 of

1993 which exempts from income tax a..ny capital gains on the

sale of treasury bills in the secondary market.

Counsel for the appellant subrnitted that within the year of

assessment 1994/1995 the Appellant acquired and sold treasury

bills in the secondary market and the Board of review do not

dispute that the transaction is purchase and sale of treasury bills

in the secondary market. The profit earned on this purchase and

sale of treasury bill in the secondary market amounted to

Rs.35,846,409.00 and the appellant claimed these profits as

capital gains exempted from income tax under Section 14 (a)

(xxii) of the Inland Revenue Act as amended. The senior assessor

rejected the return for the year of assessment 1994/1995 on the

basis that the claim for exemption as capital gain could not h=

accepted because when treasury bills are sold in the secondary

5

market before maturity, as according to the Assessor, the goon I

will consist of interest and capital gains. The assessor i

determined that out of the sum of Rs. 35,795,092.00 of the

capital gain a sum of Rs.35,846,409.00 is the interest and was

taxable. The appellant appealed to the Board of Review. The

Board of Review by its determination held that a sum of

Rs.35,846,341.00 was interest attributable to the period during

which the treasury bills were held by the appellant before the

sale, is taxable.

Counsel further draws the attention of Court that Section 2

of the Inland revenue Act read with Section 3 (h) of the Inland

Revenue Act makes income tax chargeable on capital gains made

by a person.

''for the purposes of this Act, 'profits and income' or

, fit' ,. , pro 1 s or Income means ..... .

(h) capital gains .... "

Accordingly, capital gains made on transaction by a

person was taxable under this general provision.

r

I I 1

I-I f 1 j I

Under the Section 2 of the Inland Revenue Act, the Income Tax is

chargeable in respect of profits and income of every person.

Section 3 of the Act has defined the capital gain as an income.

The Section provides that;

For the purpose of this Act, 'profits' and 'income' or 'profits or

income' means

(h) capital gains ..... .

Accordingly the general law IS that the capital gaIn IS

taxable.

Section 7(2) of the Act defines that' in relation to the capital

gain of any person the profits and income arising from the change

of the ownership of property means subject to the provisions of

Section 7 (4) the amount by which the value of the property at the

time of such change occurs exceeds its value at the time it was

acquired by that person'

7

In other words it means that 'the difference in value

between the purchase price and the sale price'. In this case the

Appellant acquired and sold Treasure Bills in the secondary

market and the price difference was Rs.35,846,409.00 which is

the questioned amount. According to the definition of the Act, it

is a capital gain. As I pointed out earlier, this amount is taxable

under the general law until the Inland Revenue (Amendment)

Act No.35 of 1993 was enacted. By this amendment the

Legislature, in its wisdom, decided to exempt from the income

tax the capital gain arising on the sale of treasury bills in the

secondary market. The Section 14 (xxii) of the Amendment Act

reads:

There shall be exempt from income tax any capital gain

arising on the sale by any person of any treasury bill held by

such person in the secondary market.

In presenting the Bill to the parliament the Minister of

Finance explained the purpose for which the amendment

exempting capital gains on the sale of treasury bills in the

8

secondary market was introduced. The Minister of Finance in

parliament introducing the Appropriation bill for 1993 explained

the purpose in the following terms;

"Mr. Speaker, the government has initiated action to issue

long terms Treasury Bills as an alternative way to

borrowing only a long terms rupee securities. Therefore, as

a measure to promote the Treasury bill market. I purpose to

exempt from income tax any capital gains arising on the

secondary market transaction of such bills. "

There is no dispute that the amount involved in this case is

a capital gain. The respondent's contention is that this amount

includes an interest component and it has to be taxed.

The Amendment Act has expressly provided that the capital

gaIn arising out of the sale of treasury bills in the secondary

market is exempted from income tax. If the words used in the

statue are clear enough to express the intention of the

III { I IIIIIf ,

f I f t I

Legislature, no restriction should be placed on such provisions

by way of interpretation so as to defeat the purpose of granting

such exemption.

In the case of (1991) 1 Sri L R 97 Nanayakkara Vs.

University of Peradeniya where the liability to pay the stamp

duty was considered and S.N.Silva J. (as he was then) held at

page 101.

" The stamp duty Act imposes a pecuniary burden on the

people. Therefore it IS subject to the rule of strict

construction. ((Maxwell on Interpretation of Statues), 12th

Edition page 256) in the case of Cape Brandy Syndicate Vs.

I.R. Cm Rowlatt J. stated as follows:

"In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly

said. There is no room for any intendment. There is no

equity about a tax. There is no presumption as to a tax.

Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can

only lookfairly at the language used".

At page 102 further held that ;

A necessary corollary of applying the rule of strict

construction to determine liability under a taxing statute,

is that any provision granting an exemption from such

liability be given its full effect. Exemptions are provided

for by the Legislature for the purpose of giving a

measure of relief to a person who would otherwise be

liable to tax under the general rule. Therefore no

restriction should be placed on such provisions by way

of interpretation so as to defeat the purpose of granting

such exemption.

This decta has been followed in other cases and is also

cited by Maxwell"

It is established law that the Fiscal Statute need a

strict interpretation. The Respondent does not

11

challenge this rule. In his submissions the learned

Counsel for the Respondent has admitted this rule.

The Respondent's argument is that the Section 113 A of the

Act applies and the capital gain is taxable. I do not agree with

this argument. This Section applies only to the deductions to be

made by the banks of Financial Institutions. On the other hand,

the schedule given in that Section refers to the sale of treasury

bills at the maturity, not on the sale of treasury bills in the

secondary market.

Counsel for the appellant further submits that according to the

Section 2 of the Registered stock and securities Ordinance

provides for the issue of registered stock, promissory notes and

bearer bonds and treasury bond Section 7,17,20 and 21 Q of the

Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance requIres the

Government to pay the principal sum and interest on registered

stock, Government Promissory Notes bearer bonds and treasury

bonds respectively.
