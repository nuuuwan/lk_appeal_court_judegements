L.T.B. Dehideniya J.

This is an appeal from the High Court of Colombo.

The Complainant Respondent Respondent (the Respondent) the

Revenue Inspector of the Colombo Municipal Council filed a plaint dated

25.06.2008 against the Respondent Petitioner Appellant (the Appellant)

Trans Asia Hotel (PLC) for violating the bylaws of the Colombo Municipal

Council. Based on this plaint/report, the Court framed the charge against the

Company, but inadvertently issued summons to the Manager of the said

hotel. The Manager appeared before Court and raised a preliminary

objection that he is not a juristic person and the case cannot be maintained

against a nonexistent person. The Court considered this submission and

discharged the Manager and on the wrong premise that the plaint has been

filed against the Manager, directed the Respondent to file an amended

plaint. The Respondent filed an amended plaint on 31.03.2009. After

hearing both parties on the admissibility, Court allowed the amendment.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Magistrate Court, the Appellant

moved in revision in the High Court of Colombo where the order of the

learned Magistrate was affirmed. The appellant presented this appeal against

the said order of the High Court.

Both Counsels were herd and they have filed their written

submissions too. It is not necessary to consider any of the lengthy legal

arguments presented by both parties.

There was no necessity to amend the plaint in this case. The written

report, commonly called as the plaint, was filed on the 26th of June 2008 by

the Respondent is at page 51 of the brief. The caption of the plaint refers to

the Accused as the "Trans Asia Hotel PLC, 117, Sir Chiththampalam A.

Gardiner Mawatha, Colombo 02". It does not refer to the "Manager" of

that hotel. In the body of the plaint it says that the "above named accused"

which refers to the "Trans Asia Hotel PLC" but not to the "Manager". In

the Journal of the case record the first entry recorded as

"Accused: The Manager, Trans Asia Hotel PLe.

Issue summons to the Accused returnable on 28.10.2008. "

The Accused named in the plaint is the Company, but the summons

was issued to the Manager. It is a mistake done by the Court staff. Issuing

summons and serving summons are two different matters. The Court should

have issued summons to the Company because the accused named in the

plaint is the Company, not to its Manager. The entire argument was based

on the understanding that the plaint has been filed against the Manager; in

fact the plaint was correctly filed against the Company. If the learned

Magistrate had gone through the plaint, this mistake would have been

rectified because a mistake of Court should not harm the parties.

Under these circumstances I dismiss the appeal and direct the learned

Magistrate to conclude this case as speciously as possible.

I order no costs.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

H.C.J.Madawala J.

I agree.
