s. Thurairaja, pc. J.

Counsel for the Accused-Appellant Submits as follows:

As per instructions, that I received from my client (Accused-Appellant)

I will be confining myself only to the question of sentence. I conceive the

facts and the circumstances of this case on which that incident had

occurred, I beg Your Lordship to consider the minimum sentence that could

be imposed in this matter in terms of Section 364(2) of the Penal Code and

also making an application under Section 359 of the Criminal Procedure

Code and humbly move Your Lordships to make an order to implement the

sentence from the date of conviction, namely 03.12.2014.

Learned DSG. for the respondent submits as follows:

Considering all available evidence I have no objection of this

application.

Considering submissions of both counsels and the facts of the case,

we find that the Accused-Appellant and the prosecutrix both are married at

the time of the incident. Further, considering the available material the

Court finds it is appropriate to impose the minimum sentence as stipulated

in Section 364(1) of the Penal Code. Accordingly we revise the sentence of

12 years Rigorous Imprisonment to 7 years Rigorous Imprisonment. The

fine and the compensation will stand as it is.

Subject to this variation withdrawal of the appeal is permitted.

Considering the period of incarceration namely 03.12.2014 as Court orders

the Prison Authorities to implement the sentence from 03.12.2014. Subject

to this variation, the appeal is dismissed.

Registrar is hereby directed to send back the Court record to the

Registrar of the High Court of Polonnaruwa for implementation of the

sentence as well as the fine and compensation.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

S. Devika de L. Tennekoon,J.

I agree.
