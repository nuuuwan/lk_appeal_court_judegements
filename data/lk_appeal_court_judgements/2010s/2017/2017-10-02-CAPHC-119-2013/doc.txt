JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

When this case came up before us on 2017-06-27, learned counsel for all

the Parties agreed to have this case disposed of by way of written

submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making ora"1 submissions.

They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment after

considering the written submissions they had filed. This judgment would

therefore be based on the material adduced by parties in their pleadings

and the contents of their written submissions.

The Secretary,Pradeshiya Sabha, Kanthale, who has been named in the

petition of appeal as the Petitioner - Respondent - Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Respondent) had issued a

notice dated 2012-05-29 on the Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant), in terms of section

28 A (1) of the Urburn Development Authority Law No. 41 of 1978 as

4

amended by Act No.4 of 1982 and Act No. 44 of 1984 (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the UDA Act).

As the Appellant had failed to comply with the directions issued on him by

the said notice, the Respondent had thereafter made an application to the

Magistrate's Court of Kanthale under section 28 A (3) of the UDA Act

seeking a mandatory order to demolish the building unlawfully constructed

by the Appellant.

Learned Magistrate had then afforded an opportunity for the Appellant to

show cause against issuance of the order sought. After an inquiry learned

Magistrate had pronounced the order dated 2013-09-10 granting authority

under section 28 A (3) for the Respondent to demolish the said

construction.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate, the

Appellant had made a revision application to the Provincial High Court of

the Eastern provine holden at Trincomalee.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge upon the said application for revision

being supported before him, by its order dated 2013-09-12, had refused

the interim relief sought by the Appellant but proceeded to issue notices on

the Respondents!.

Thereafter learned Provincial High Court Judge, by his order dated 2013-

09-12, had allowed a subsequent application to withdraw the said revision

application made on behalf of the Appellant. This had resulted in the

dismissal of the said revision application.

Thereafter on 2013-09-16 the Appellant had filed a motion requesting

permission of Court to reopen the case. However learned Provincial High

Court Judge by his order dated 2013-09-16 had refused the said

application. The order made by the learned Provincial High Court Judge in

that regard is to the following effect: " ... Application made to reopen the

case. The application has been withdrawn and the petition rejected

accordingly. An application withdrawn cannot be reopened. Application to

reopen case is disallowed .... "

The Appellant has prayed in his petition of appeal to this Court that both

the order dated 2013-09-12 and the order dated 2013-09-16 made by the

learned High Court Judge be set aside.

1 Paragraph 8 of the petition of appeal.

6

Upon a subsequent revision application filed by the Appellant this Court by

it's order dated 2013-09-252 had held that " ... on perusal of the order dated

2013-09-16 it appears that the learned High Court Judge by stating that he

rejects the petition has in fact meant that he was rejecting the motion to

have the revision application restored to the roll. In the light of the above

facts we are unable to see any error committed by the learned High Court

Judge although the petitioner attempts to demonstrate that the learned

High Court Judge had erred in law by making both orders, namely the

order of the dismissal of the revision application and the order refusing to

restore the revision application to the roll. ... "

We fully agree with the above findings of their Lordships who heard that

application.

Further it must be noted that this Court has already pronounced a finding

on the points canvassed by the Appellant in this appeal. Thus the Appellant

cannot be permitted to have a second opportunity to agitate the same

matter before the same forum. Once one bench has decided the points

canvassed in a case it is not open for the parties to canvass the same

points before another bench of the same Court to persuade it to re-decide

those pOints. The position should be the same when an appeal as well as

an application for revision have been filed canvassing the same pOints

seeking the same reliefs. In such a situation once, the first case3 is decided

that decision must apply to the second case as well because the

pronouncement on those points is by the same Court. Such decision on

those points shall become final and conclusive as far as that Court is

concerned.

Thus, for the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal.

The Appellant must pay a state cost of Rs. 30,000/=
