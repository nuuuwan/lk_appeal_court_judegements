P.R. Walgama, J

This appeal projects a challenge to the judgment dated

18.12.2013, rendered by the Learned Trial Judge, wherein

the Accused - Appellant was convicted for kidnapping the

victim from the lawful custody, who was under 16 years

of age and thereby committed an offence punishable

under Section 354 and having raped the victim, and thereby

committed an offence punishable under Section 364 (2) (e) of

the Penal Code as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995.

As stated above the 1st count in the indictment refers

to a period from 1.12.2011 to 20.12.2012 during which

the alleged offence was committed. Before the conclusion

of the trial the Accused - Appellant pleaded guilty to the

charges contained in the indictment and was sentenced to

7 years Rigorous Imprisonment on the 1st , 3rd and 5th

coun ts accordingly.

The 2nd count In the indictment refers to the same

period during which the alleged offence of rape was

committed, punishable under Section 364(2) (e) of the Penal

Code as amended by Act No. 22 of 1995, and sequel to

the conviction the Accused - Appellant was sentenced to

20 years of Rigorous Imprisonment on 2nd, 4th and 6th

counts respectively.

The count Nos 5 and 6 refers to the charges of the

same nature but committed on 21.02.2012 and after the

conviction, Accused - Appellant was sentenced to 7 years

and 20 years of Rigorous Imprisonment.

Nevertheless it IS seen from count 3 and 4 In the

indictment that there IS no reference to a specific date

of the commission of the offence stated therein but had

referred to the period within which the alleged offence of

kidnapping and rape was committed by the Accused-

Appellant. Therefore it is abundantly clear that when the

Accused - Appellant opted to plead guilty to the charges, he

was aware of the commission of the said offences, and was

not taken by surprise. Therefore this court holds that no

injustice had been caused to the Accused - Appellant at the

trial in the High Court.

In perusing the sentence, it is seen that for charges 1,

3 ,and 5 in the indictment a jail term of 7 years

Rigorous Imprisonment was ordered to run consecutively

and for charges 2,4, and 6 in the indictment a jail term

of 20 years Rigorous Imprisonment was imposed to run

consecutively.

In addition to the afore said, a sum of Rs. 2500/ was

imposed as a fine for each count Nos 2,4 and 6. Besides

a sum of Rs. 50,000/ each count No: 2, 4 and 6 as

compensation was ordered to be paid to the victim.

3

The ground norm or the grounds of appeal as per

confutation of the counsel for the Accused - Appellant are

for not affording a fair trial to the Accused - Appellant.

In that it is said no specific date has been mentioned

as to the commlSSlOn of the alleged crime, although the

period within which the said offence was committed as

one year period has been mentioned in the indictment.

Therefore it is contended by the counsel for the Accused

- Appellant that the said flaw In the indictment IS

contrary or obnoxious to the Section 165 read along with

Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Hence in

for the

acquitted

the above setting it is urged by the

Accused - Appellant that he IS entitled

on that score alone as the charge

counsel

to be

In the

indictment does not specify the date of the commission

of the alleged offence.

For the reasons as state above it IS contended by the

counsel for the Accused - Appellant that the Accused-

Appellant was denied a fair trial on following basis;

1. That the trial was commenced on a defective

indictment in contravention of the Criminal Procedure

Code,

2. That the trial continued on a defective indictment

and as a result the trial is rendered invalid'

3. That the Accused - Appellant was denied a fair trial

on the basis that he was not properly defended by

the counsel assigned for him by court.

4. Pleading guilty for defective indictment has no

legal binding as the proceedings in this matter has

become defective from the commencement of this

case.

The categorical

Respondent was

to defend the

necessary steps to

Accused - Appellant

position of the counsel for the

that by court aSSIgnIng a counsel

Accused -Appellant had taken

safeguard the righ ts of the

and as such has counteracted

the position taken by the counsel for the Accused

- Appellant.

It is worthy to mention that, if the contention of the

counsel for the Accused - Appellant IS to attach weight,

the court will have to consider the efficiency and

capability of the counsel In determining the case.

But this court is of the VIew that the performance

of the counsel at the trial in the original court is not

a criteria in deciding the matter in court. Further

it IS seen from the indictment, as the victim was

raped many times the

Accused - Appellant committed

period within

the alleged

which the

offence IS

stated therein. Therefore it is to be noted that the

Accused - Appellant was never misled and he was

well aware of the charges and he decided to plead

guilty.

5

In the above setting this court see no reason to

interfere with the judgment and the sentence

imposed by the Learned Trial Judge. Accordingly we

dismiss the appeal.

Appeal is dismissed.
