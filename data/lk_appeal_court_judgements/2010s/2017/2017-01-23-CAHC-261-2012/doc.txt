Accused - Appellant.

Respondents.

The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of Colombo for

solicitating a sum of Rs. 50,000/= and accepting the same under Sec. 19

(b) and 19 (c) of the Bribery Act. The appellant was convicted on the first,

and second charges and he was acquitted on the third and fourth charges

which are alternative charges.

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the solicitating

was done between the 01 st to the 30th April 1996, which the learned High

Court Judge failed to consider thus causing an error. He further submitted

that the learned High Court Judge failed to give due consideration to the

debilitating infirmities of the prosecution witnesses. It was held in

Karunarathne vs A.G. 1998 3 SLR 261;

2

"Even if one can say on the evidence that there was a willingness to

accept an amount on the evidence led there is no positive evidence in

regard to the date when that willingness had been expressed".

The appellant's counsel stated that the solicitation was done not

during the period referred to in the indictment but on the 08th of February

1996 vide pages 95 and 97 of the brief.

The learned counsel for the accused appellant submitted that the

learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the contradictions inter -

se. On a perusal of the evidence of the first witness we find that he has gone

to the accused appellant's office which he described and said it was partially

made of non transparent glass. But the decoy Seneviratne has testified to

the effect that the glass cubicle was transparent. Witness Nimal Gunasena,

Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue also stated in evidence that the

glass cubicle was not transparent. On this, a doubt arises as to how the

decoy observed the transaction taking place. This contradiction goes to the

root of the case. The learned High Court Judge has failed to give the benefit

of this doubt to the accused appellant.

According to the first witness the money which was given by the

Bribery Commission was with the decoy but the decoy has testified to the

effect that the money was with the first witness (vide page 127). In the

judgment of SC appeal no. 99/2007 SC Spl. L.a. no. 80/2007 it was held;

"Paramount duty 0/ the court to consider the entire evidence -

judicial evaluation 0/ credibility 0/ prosecution witnesses - no

conviction on inconsistent statements - 'Beyond reasonable doubt' is

the standard o/proo/in criminal cases".

Witness Anandaraja has received P1 on the 05th of February 1996

and he has gone to meet the accused appellant on the following day (pages

95 and 97). On this evidence we could see that the charges of solicitation

has not been established by the prosecution. And the second charge of

accepting the money too has not been established beyond reasonable

doubt as stated above.

For the afore stated reasons this court decides to set aside the

conviction and the sentence dated 21 st March 2002, and allow the appeal.

Appeal Allowed.
