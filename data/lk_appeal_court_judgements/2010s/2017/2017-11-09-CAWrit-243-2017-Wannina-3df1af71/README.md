This is an application for mandates in the nature of writs of Mandamus and

Prohibition. The Petitioners state that the 10th Respondent was in the process

of clearing about 20 acres of forest and constructing an electrical fence

round the cleared area. The Petitioners case is that the area being a natural

elephant habitat, this human intervention may disturb the seasonal

movements of the elephant and it can increase the elephant-human conflict.

The paragraph 10 of the petition states thus;

10) The said report inter alia states that clearing/developing this area

will result blocking of the seasonal movement of the Elephants as well

as the loss of critical resources and habitat. This will lead to

elephants having to move through villages and cultivations during

their seasonal movements and increased crop raiding by elephants to

survive. Therefore it will cause severe escalation of human-elephant

conflict in the area.

The Petitioners have made several negotiations with Government Officials

in this regard and found that the 10th Respondent had not obtained any

permit or license to clear the forest or to construct an electric fence.

Therefore the Petitioners move this Court to issue several writs of

mandamus compelling the Respondents to act according to law.

The writ of mandamus is issued against a government official or a body in

authority to compel them to do their statutory function. The Petitioners

5

explain in paragraph 34 of the petition the statutory duty that the respondents

failed to carry out. The Petitioners complain is that;

34) There is a failure on the part of the 1st to the 9th Respondent to

take adequate steps to make necessary inquiries and investigations to

ascertain the title to the land, the legality of the forest clearance and

the putting up of the electric fence and to enforce the provisions of the

law.

The 15t to 9th Respondents are government officials and authorities entrusted

with different duties and powers under separate statutes. The .Petitioners

have failed to explain to what statutory function of duty that each

Respondent failed to comply with.

The Petitioners application to issue writs of mandamus against these

officials is also without specifying the statutory duty that they failed to

comply. Writ of mandamus follows with a penal liability for not complying.

Therefore it is necessary to identify the relevant duty that each official is

directed to perfonn. In the prayer to the petition sub paragraph (b) to (f) the

petitioners move that;

(b) Make Order in the nature of a Mandamus directing the rt to 9th

Respondents to take necessary measures within the law in respect of

the several violations of the provisions of the law.

(c) Make Order in the nature of a Mandamus directing the rt to 9th

Respondents to take necessary measures within the law to stop the

aforesaid destruction of the forest and the environment in violation of

the provisions of the law.

(d) Make Order in the nature of a Mandamus directing the 1st to 9th

Respondents to take necessary measures within the law to prevent the

escalation of the human-elephant conflict in the area in question and

in particular in the Ehetuwewa Divisional Secretariat Division of

Ehetuwewa ofGalgamuwa, Kurunegala in the Western Province

(e) Make Order in the nature of a Mandamus directing the rt to 9th

Respondents to take necessary measures within the law to have the

site restored.

(f) Make Order in the nature of a Mandamus directing the rt to 9th

Respondents to take necessary measures within the law preventing the

unlawful obstruction of the migration/movement of elephants in the

Ehetuwewa area.

In all these prayers, the Petitioners move this Court to issue writs of

mandamus in general against the 1 st to 9th Respondents. Since there is a

punishment for non compliance of the Court order, I am of the view that the

Petitioners cannot maintain an application for a writ of mandamus in this

nature. It has to be specific. Especially in the wide range of activities that are

being complained of in this case, it is essential to explain each and every

order directed to which Respondent and the statutory duty that has to be

complied with. Otherwise the 1 st to 9th Respondents will have to face a

situation that they could be charged for Contempt of Court on unimaginable

instances. In the case of Samastha Lanka Nidahas Grama Niladhari

Sangamaya v. Dissanayake and others 2011 (2) B.L.R. 467 Sathya Hettiga J

cited with approval the decision in the case of P.S. Bus Company V.

Secretary of Ceylon Transport Board 61 NLR 491 at 496 where it was held

7

that "the Court held when considering granting a Writ the Court will

consider the probable consequences of granting a prerogative writ".

The prayers (g), (h) and (i) are connected to the main prayers and cannot

stand alone.

The Counsel for the 1 oth Respondent submitted that the 10th Respondent is

the owner of about 2000 acres under a "sannasa" and it has been registered

under the relevant laws and therefore he is entitle to posses his land in the

way he wants. The Divisional Secretary of Ehatuwewa had confirmed that

the 10th Respondent owns several lands on a "sannasa" by letter marked

P7( e). Even if it is a private or Sangika land, if it is a forest, under relevant

laws it is necessary to obtain the necessary permits prior to clear the forest.

The environment protection laws in relation to deforestation are not only for

the state lands but it applies to the private lands as well subject to the fact

that it is a forest. In the present case, the Petitioners cannot maintain the

application as it is.

Under these circumstances, I refuse notice and dismiss the application.
