The three accused in the instant appeal along with another person were indicted before the High Court

of Ratnapura for having committed the death of Madawan Sadanandan on or about 09.02.2003.

When the indictments were served on them before the High Court of Ratnapura on 03.03.2008 the

accused elected to be tried before the High Court Judge without a jury. At the conclusion of the trial

the 1 sr, 2nd and the 3rd accused were found guilty of the said charge and were sentences to death and the

4th accused on the indictment, namely Muthumala Kanagaraj was acquitted by the Learned High Court

Judge.

Being dissatisfied with the said conviction and sentence, the 1 sr, 2nd and3rd accused have filed the

present appeal before this court.

As revealed before us, there was no eye witness to the main incident which ended up with the death of

the deceased person but the prosecution had relied on the evidence of one Muruges Ravindan who

witnessed to an incident that has taken place few minutes prior to the main incident between the

deceased person and the 4 accused.

Other than the said evidence, prosecution had relied on several items of circumstantial evidence to

establish the case in hand including a dying deposition made by the deceased to his wife Weeranan

Irulai.

As observed by this court the 15t accused-appellant had taken up a defence of sudden fight and the

other three accused including the 4th accused who was acquitted after trial had denied any knowledge

with regard to the incident and had taken up the defence of an alibi.

During the argument before us the learned counsel who appeared for the 15t accused-appellant had

restricted his appeal to two grounds of appeal namely,

a) Learned Trial Judge erred in law on the principles relating to burden of proof

b) Without prejudice to the above, the evidence led at the trial warrants a conviction for lessor

culpability

The learned counsel who appeared for the 2nd and 3rd accused-appellants whilst relying on the above

two grounds of appeal, further relied on a 3rd ground of appeal namely,

c) Learned Trial Judge erred in law on the principle relating to burden of proof specially on the

defence of alibi

As revealed from the evidence led at the High Court Trial, the first incident between the 4 accused and

the deceased had croped up when the deceased passed the place where the 4 accused were gathered

with witness Ravindran.

According to the evidence of witness Revindran he had met the deceased person around 8.00 am and

walked towards the Kovil in order to go for work. On that day they were to cut fire wood and therefore

the deceased carried a knife with him. When they reached the Kovil the witness had seen all 4 accused

seated near the Kovil and after seeing them, the 4 accused questioned them as follows;

At that moment all four accused had suddenly attacked the deceased with whatever the weapons they

had in their hands. 1st accused had a knife with him. 2nd accused and 3rd accused had clubs with them.

4th accused did not have a weapon with him but the witness had seen the 4th accused assaulting the

deceased with hands. The moment the deceased was attacked by the four accused, the deceased ran

toward his line room chased by the 4 accused. Witness too had ran to his house which is little away in

a different estate.

The next witness the prosecution relied upon was the wife of the deceased Weeranan Irulai. According

to the evidence of Irulai, at the time she left her house for work on the day in question, her husband

Sadanandan was getting ready to go for some work with one Ravindran. On that day she was engaged

in plucking tea leaves 50 feet away from her line room and when she was engaged in plucking tea

leaves, she heard cries of a man and identified it as the voice of her husband.

After hearing the cries of her husband, she ran towards the direction from which she heard the cries

and saw her husband fallen between her line room and the Kovil near some bushes. When she went

and inquired, the deceased informed her that Alii cut him and Ukkun and Weeramani attacked him

with clubs. When she went up to the deceased she saw AlIi, Ukkun, Weeramani and another by name

Kanagaraj standing close by and out of them AlIi had a knife with him and Ukkun and Weeramani had

clubs with them. Witness identified Alii as the 1st accused Ukkun as the 3rd accused and Weeramani as

the 2nd accused. The other person present was identified as the 4th accused before the High Court

Trial.

During the argument before us, the counsel who represented all accused-appellants challenged the

evidence given by Ravindran on the basis that he made the statement 10 days after the incident and

therefore it is not safe to act on the evidence of Ravindran. However as observed by us, witness

5 I IRavindran does not speak of causing grievous injuries on the deceased but only refers to attacking the

hands and giving a slap on the face prior to the deceased person taking to his heals. (Proceedings at

pages 34-39)

According to the Medical evidence placed by Dr. A.G. Manjula who conducted the Post Mortem

Inquiry, he had observed 12 cut injuries and 2 contusions on the body of the deceased.

When considering the evidence of witness Ravindran along with the medical evidence referred to

above it is clear that the injuries inflicted on the deceased has not taken place in front of the Kovil in

the presence of witness Ravindran but those injuries had been inflicted on him at a subsequent

occasion. In the said circumstances it is clear that the evidence of witness Ravindran only explains as

to how the incident between the deceased and the accused-appellants have started, but the rest of the

things happened on that day is not established through his evidence but, the dying deposition made to r I the wife of the deceased explains those events before the trial court. ,

i

As further revealed before us, the wife of the deceased Weeranan Irulai had made a prompt statement

to the police and the said position was confirmed during her cross examination. The fact that the 1st to

3rd accused were present in the vicinity, too was confirmed in her evidence but the witness under cross

examination had admitted that she could not refer to the presence of the 4th accused in her police

statement.

Witness Ravindran had explained the reason for delay in making the statement as follows,

As revealed above, witness Ravindran who was only 15 years of age when the incident had taken

place, was frightened to make a statement due to fear and in the said circumstances we see no reason

to reject the evidence of witness Ravindran for the delay in making the statement. This position was

discussed in the case of Ajith Samakoon Vs, Republic 2004 (2) Sri LR 209 at 220 as follows,

"Just because the statement of a witness is belated the court is not entitled to reject such statement if

the reasons for the delay adduced by the witness are justifiable and probable. The trial judge is entitled

to act on the evidence of the witness who had made a belated statement."

As observed above, the evidence of witness Ravindran had explained as to how the incident between

the deceased and the accused had commenced and the said statement had corroborated the

circumstantial evidence placed before court with regard to the death of deceased Sadanandan.

In the dying deposition said to have made by the deceased to his wife, there is reference to 151 accused-

appellant attacking the deceased with a knife and 2nd and 3rd accused-appellants attacking with clubs.

Witness Ravindran had confirmed the fact that the 151 accused had a knife and the 2nd and 3rd accused

having clubs when the incident commenced in front of the Kovil. Medical evidence too had confirmed

this position since Dr. A.G. Manjula had observed both cut injuries as well as contusions on the body

of the deceased. In the said circumstance we see no reason to interfear with the findings of the learned

Trial Judge when he concluded that it is safe to act on the dying deposition made by the deceased to

his wife which was corroborated by independent evidence.

Even though the counsel who appeared for the accused-appellants have challenged the evidence of

witness Ravindran since it was made 10 days after the incident, both counsel heavily relied on the

same evidence and attempted to take an advantage of the following pices of evidence given by him to

show the availability of elements leading to a lessor culpability on the basis of a sudden fight.

that the learned Trial judge had failed to consider the possibility of a sudden fight which will lead to a

j lessor culpability on the accused-appellants.

However it is important to consider the evidence of witness Ravindran in its proper perspective rather

than taking portions of his evidence taking them out of context. As observed by this court the position

taken by witness Ravindran before the trial court was that the entire incident taken place in front Kovil

has not even taken two minutes. This position is clear from the following portions of his evidence.

When considering the above portions of the evidence of witness Ravindran, it is clear that the only

fight referred to by the witness was the attack on the deceased by all four accused-appellants which

had not taken more than 2 minutes prior to the deceased taken to his heel in order to escape from his

attackers.

Even though the learned Trial Judge had not made specific reference to this aspect of the case, he has

referred to in his judgment and was mindful of all the exceptions under section 294 of the Penal Code.

As discussed above in this judgment, the evidence available in this case is not suggestive of a

conviction for lessor culpability and in the said circumstance the trial judge cannot be faulted for his

failure to consider lessor culpability on the three accused-appellants.

In the case of Saranelis Silva Vs, Attorney General 1997 3 SLR 182 their lordships have considered

this position and held that, "if there is no evidence before court to reduce murder to culpable homicide

then judge cannot be faulted for not inviting the jury to consider a lessor offence."

Evidence of witness Ravindran, which was corroborated by the dying deposition and the medical

evidence, clearly indicated that more than one weapon was used to attack the deceased person. When

the Doctor who performed the autopsy was cross examined, it was suggested to him by the defence

that the contusions found on the body of the deceased could have been caused due to a fall but the

medical expert had denied those suggestions.

In the dying deposition referred to above, there is clear reference of attacking the deceased by all three

accused using a knife by the lSI accused-appellant and clubs by the 2nd and 3rd accused-appellants. This

position is further strengthen by the evidence of Irulai when she said that she saw the l st,2nd and 3rd

accused in the vicinity armed with weapons. As observed above, this position taken up by witness

Irurai was further confirmed under cross examination. In these circumstances the defence of alibi

taken up by the 2nd and 3rd accused-appellants have not created a doubt on the evidence placed on

behalf of prosecution and in the said circumstances we see reason to interfear with the finding of the

learned Trial Judge when he decided to reject the defecne of alibi taken by the 2nd and the 3rd accused-

appellants.

However in this regard this court is further mindful of the decision in Dayananda Loku Galappaththi

and Eight Others V. The State 2003 (3) Sri LR 362 this position was discussed as follows;

"In a Jury trial an accused is tried by his own peers. Jurors are ordinary laymen. In order to perform

their duties specified in section 232 of the Code, the Trial Judge has to inform them of their duties. In

a trial by a Judge of the High Court without a jury, there is no provision similar to section 217. There

is no requirement similar to section 229 that the Trial Judge should lay down the law which he is to be

guided. In appeal the Appellate Judges will consider whether in fact the Trial Judge was alive and

mindful of the relevant principle of law and has applied them in arriving at his conclusion. The law

takes for granted that a Judge with a trained Legal mind is well possessed of the principles of law, he

would apply."

When considering all the matters referred to above we see no reason to interfear with the findings of

the Learned Trial Judge. As further observed by us the Learned Trial Judge has correctly evaluated the

evidence placed before him and decided to acquit the 4th accused from the charge against him. In the

said circumstances we are not inclined to grant any relief to the three accused-appellants.

We therefore dismissed this appeal and affirm the conviction and sentence imposed on the accused-

appellants.

Appeal dismissed. Conviction and sentences imposed on all three accused-appellants are affirmed.
