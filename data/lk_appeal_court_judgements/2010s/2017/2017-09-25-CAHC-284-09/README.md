The second accused was indicted on the counts relating to the

alleged abetment of the offence referred to in counts no. 3 and no. 4 and

was tried in absentia.

After trial High Court had found the appellant guilty of all four counts

and convicted for all four counts preferred against him. He was imposed

one year RI and a fine of Rs. 5000/= carrying a default term of 6 months

each for all the counts. This appeal is from the said conviction and the

sentence.

According to the prosecution the complainant wanted to get the

radio license renewed in order to get his daughter admitted to a school

and had met the appellant on or about 20/07/1994. The appellant had

demanded Rs. 3,000/= to attend to the above stated purpose and on

being making a complaint, the officers of the Bribery Commission, had

arrested the appellant and his assistant (second accused) after

conducting a raid.

All the parties have agreed to adopt the evidence that has been

lead before predecessor of the Judge who wrote the judgment. The first

ground of appeal raised by the appellant was the credibility of the

complainant. The counsel for the appellant submitted that the

complainant is a man of lose morals.

This submission was made on the basis that he lived with another

woman which is totally irrelevant to this case. The counsel for the

appellant submitted that the complainant has given evasive evidence in

cross examination and referred to page 74 of the brief.

Those question posed to the complainant were not relevant to the

issue in hand. And the learned High Court Judge shouldn't have allowed

those question and those question offend Section 5 of the Evidence

Ordinance which provides that evidence can be lead of facts in issue and

relevant fact only.

Learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that the money in

question was given to the assistant of the appellant and not to the

appellant himself, but I find that this money has been given on the

direction of the appellant in the presence of the decoy and the

complainant.

The counsel for the appellant further submitted that the evidence

of the decoy amounts to confessionary nature and submitted such

evidence is not admissible. At the time of the transaction appellant was

not in the custody of the decoy or the investigating officer and therefore

the words uttered by the appellant implicating him does not come under

section 25 of the Evidence Ordinance.

Although the appellant's counsel argued that the learned High

Court Judge failed to analyze the defence evidence, on a perusal of

pages 189 and 190 I find it otherwise. The complainant himself has

testified that he has no personal interest or animosity towards the

appellant. He has stated that he never wanted to testify against the

appellant.

On a perusal of the evidence I find that no contradictions were

marked. Therefore one could say, that no doubt was created by the

defence on the evidence of the prosecution.

For the afore stated reasons I am not inclined to set aside a well

considered judgment. The judgment dated 26/03/2009 is affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.
