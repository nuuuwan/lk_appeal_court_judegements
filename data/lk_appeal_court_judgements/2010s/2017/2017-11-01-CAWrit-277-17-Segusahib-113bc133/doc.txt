L.T.B. Dehideniya J. (PICA)

This is an application for a mandate in the nature of a writ of

mandamus against the Magistrate Kandy to compel him to accept a

private plaint filed by the Petitioner.

The Petitioner had obtained a loan facility from a financial

institute. The Petitioner states that the fmance company had offered the

loan on the interest rate of 15% but later it had been increased to 26%

without his consent and knowledge. The Petitioner further stated that he

had requested for a certified copy of the loan agreement and the mortgage

bond several times but the fmancial institution has neglected or failed to

issue a copy. Under these circumstances the Petitioner filed papers to

institute a criminal action, a charge punishable under section 400 of the

Penal Code, in the Magistrate Court Kandy but the learned Magistrate has

refused to issue summons on the basis that he was not satisfied to proceed

with regard to the charge against the accused as per section 139(1) of

Criminal Procedure Code. The petitioner's contention is that the learned

Magistrate should have called the witnesses and form the opinion whether

to issue summons or not.

Under section 139(1) the Magistrate has to form an opinion as to

whether there is a reason to issue summons. The section 139 reads thus;

139.

(1) Where proceedings have been instituted under paragraph (a) or

paragraph (A) or paragraph (c) of section 136 (1) and the

3

Magistrate is of opinion that there is sufficient ground for

proceeding against some person who is not in. custody -

(a) if the case appears to be one in which according to the

fourth column of the First Schedule a summons should issue in

the first instance, he shall, subject to the provisions of section

63, issue a summons for the attendance of such person;

(b) if the case appears to be one in which according to that

column a warrant should issue in the first instance, he shall

issue a warrant for causing such person to be brought or to

appear before the court at a certain time:

Provided that -

(i) the Magistrate may in any case, if he thinks fit, issue a

summons in the first instance instead of a warrant;

(ii) in any case under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of

section 136 (1), the Magistrate shall, before issuing a

warrant, and may, before issuing a summons, examine on

oath the complainant or some material witness or witnesses;

and

(iii) in any case under paragraph (c) of section 136 (1), the

Magistrate shall, before issuing process, record a brief

statement of the facts which constitute his means of

knowledge or of the grounds of his suspicion, as the case

may be.

(2) Where proceedings have been instituted under paragraph (j) of

section 136 (1), the Magistrate shall forthwith examine on oath or

affirmation the person who has brought the accused before the

4

court and any other person who may be present in court able to

speak to the facts of the case:

Provided that such examination shall not be necessary where the

Magistrate has before him a report of the facts of the case or a

complaint in writing has been filed.

(3) Where proceedings have been instituted under paragraph (e) or

paragraph (j) of section 136 (1), the Magistrate shall issue a

summons for the attendance of the person named in the warrant or

complaint, or a warrant for causing such person to be brought or

to appear before the court at a certain time, according as the

fourth column of the First Schedule provides that the case is one in

which a summons or a warrant should issue in the first instance

Under sub section (1) (a) (ii) of this section it is not mandatory for

the magistrate to examine witnesses before issuing summons; it is the

discretion of the magistrate in considering the circumstances. If the

learned Magistrate can form an opinion, on the papers itself, that there is

no reason to issue summons to an accused person named in a private

plaint filed by an individual, that opinion will not change by calling the

witnesses. If there is a reason to frame charges according to the plaint

filed, then only the necessity to call the witnesses to ascertain whether the

summons should be issued or not will arise. If the Magistrate is of the

opinion on the plaint itself that no offence disclosed, it is not necessary to

call witnesses.

In the present case the Petitioner's allegation is that the financial

institute did not issue a copy of the loan agreement and the mortgage

bond. It does not constitute a criminal offence. It is a civil transaction.

The Petitioner has marked the offer letter as P 1. Under the heading

"interest" the offer made is "15% p. a. payable monthly and subject to

5

fluctuation at the discretion of the Commercial Credit and Finance PLC"

The financial institute had retained the discretion to alter the interest

under this clause. Therefore the consent of the Petitioner is not required

for any fluctuation of the interest. The Learned Magistrate very correctly

formed the opinion not to proceed with the charge.

I see no reason to issue notice.

Notice refused and the application dismissed.
