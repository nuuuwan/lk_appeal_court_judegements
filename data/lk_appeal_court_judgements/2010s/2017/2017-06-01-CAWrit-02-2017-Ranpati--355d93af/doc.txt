Vijith K.Malalgoda, PC J (P / CAl

Heard counsel in support of this application.

The Petitioner's present application refers to a charge sheet just

served against her by the 1 st Respondent Bank. As revealed from the

submissions made by the counsel for the petitioner, the petitioner was

the Bank Manager of Kochchikade National Savings Bank where gold

loans running into Rs. 48 million had been granted to 06 people from

a jewellery shop in Kochchikade. With regard to the said transactions a

charge sheet has been served on the petitioner and the learned counsel

takes up the position that the charges against her are weak for the

reason that there was no reference to the circulars under which she

had been charge sheeted. However going through the charge sheet

1

before us it is clear that the charges had been framed under the clear

provisions of the Disciplinary Code of the respondent bank along with

two circulars namely 595 and 596. The learned counsel brings to our

notice few other circulars which were released by the 1 st respondent's

bank in 2014 and submits that there is no relevance of these circulars

to the offence since the offence was committed previously. However we

observe that the charge sheet does not referred to the new circulars but

referred to the circulars which were in operation at that time namely for

the circulars Nos. 595 and 596. Under these circumstances it is clear

that the charges had been framed on consideration of the circulars and

the Disciplinary Code which was in operation at the time the alleged

offence said to have committed by the petitioner. Under these

circumstances we see no reason to interfere with the decision by the 1 st

respondent bank to charge sheet the petitioner and therefore we are not

inclined to issue notice at this juncture. Notices are refused.
