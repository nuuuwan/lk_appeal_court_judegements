Decided on: 19.04.2017

.A. H. M. D. Nawaz, J (PICA) Acting

This Court has heard the learned counsel for the Petitioner and the learned

Senior Deputy Solicitor General. The objection taken by the learned Senior

Deputy Solicitor General is that the principal order (P3) canvassed in this case

is dated 29.06.2012 but this application to this court has been made only in

2017 after a lapse of 5 years. However, this Court finds that though P3 dated

29.06.2012 makes a determination that the Petitioner is in violation of section

83(c) (1) of the Banking Act as amended, the consequential steps that are

specified in the Banking Act after that opinion was expressed, have not been

taken and it appears from a perusal of the pleadings that no suspension _ of

the business that the Petitioners are engaged in has really taken place. In

other words, the business has not been suspended per se. This Court takes

the view that the petitioner must make out a prima facie case for judicial

review in the sense of the Atkinian formula which prescribes as a threshold

some kind of impact on one's rights or interests. In these circumstances this

Court sees no reason to issue notice in this case and dismisses the petition

but the petitioner is not precluded from taking appropriate steps at a later

stage if its rights are affected.
