This is an appeal from the High Court of Gampaha.

The facts relating to this appeal are as follows. On a complaint

made by the 1 st Party Respondent Petitioner Respondents (Respondents)

to the Kirindiwela police, the OlC filed information in the Magistrate

Court of Pugoda under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act.

The learned Magistrate, after an inquiry, determined that the Respondents

are in possession and ordered the 2nd Party Respondent Respondent

Petitioners (Petitioners) not to disturb the possession of the Respondents.

Thereafter the Respondents made an application to execute a writ of

possession but the learned Magistrate refused the application on the basis

that the Respondents are in the possession and there is no necessity to

execute a writ of possession. The Respondents made another application

on 18.08.2008 for a writ of possession stating that the Petitioners are

continually disturbing the possession. On this application the Court issued

the writ of possession on 11.12.2008 and it has been executed on

23.12.2008. Thereafter the Petitioners made an application to the Court to

restore their possession. The Court after inquiry, on 05.03.2009 made

order to restore the Petitioners in possession. Being aggrieved the said

order of the learned Magistrate dated 05.03.2009 the Respondents moved

in revision in the Provincial High Court of Gampaha. The learned High

Court Judge on 08.08.2012 made order setting aside the order of the

learned Magistrate dated 05.03.2009. Being aggrieved by the said order

of the learned High Court Judge the Petitioners appealed against.

The learned Magistrate in his order date 05.03.2009 has come to a

finding that his predecessor has issued the writ of possession

unnecessarily and made order to restore the Petitioners back in

possession. The Primary Court Procedure Act does not provide any

4

provision to make such an order; therefore the learned Magistrate utilized

the section 78 of the Primary Court Procedure Act to bring in the

provisions of Civil Procedure Code.

The learned High Court Judge in revision considered the case of

Kayas v. Nazeer and others [2004] 3 Sri L R 202 (2003 BLR 30) and

decided that this section can be applied only where the case or proceeding

is a criminal prosecution or proceeding and where the case is a civil

action or proceeding. The action under part vii of the Primary Court

Procedure Act is neither criminal prosecution or proceeding nor is civil

action or proceeding but a special category.

The section 78 of the Primary Court Procedure Act has been considered

and held in the said case at page 209 that;

Casus Omissus Clause (Section 78)

Section 78 of the Primary Court Procedure Act is in the following

terms.

78 - "If any matter should arise for which no provision is made in

the Act, the provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act

governing a like matter which the case or proceeding is a criminal

prosecution or proceedings, and the provisions of the Civil

Procedure Code governing a like matter where the case is a civil

action or proceeding shall with suitable adaptations as the justice

of the case may require be adopted and applied. "

Section 2 of the Primary Court Procedure Act stipulates that

subject to the provisions of the Act and other written law, the civil

and criminal jurisdiction of the Primary Court shall be ex~lusive.

Part III of the Act comprising Sections 24 - 36 provides for the

mode of institution of criminal prosecution; while part IV of the Act f r

I

J I I I I I I ,

comprising Sections 37 - 53 provides for the mode of institution of

civil actions. Thus, Section 78 has been designed to bring in

provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code Act or the provisions of

the Civil procedure Code Act only in situations where either a

criminal prosecutions or a civil action within part III or part IV of

the Act respectively are involved. Inquiries into disputes affecting

land where a breach of the peace is threatened or likely to be

threatened under part VII comprising Sections 66 - 76 are neither

in the nature of a criminal prosecution or proceeding nor in the

nature of civil action or proceeding. Those proceedings are of

special nature since orders that are being made are of a

provisional nature to maintain status quo for the sole purpose of

preventing a breach of the peace and which are to be superseded

by an order or a decree of a competent Court. Another significant

feature is that Section 78 while making reference to criminal

prosecutions or proceedings and civil actions or proceedings, has

not made any reference to disputes affecting land. This exclusion

would reveal the legislative intent that Section 78 is not intended to

be made use of, for inquiries pertaining to disputes affecting land

under part VII of the Act.

The learned High Court Judge has correctly held that the

Magistrate cannot use section 78 of the Act in proceeding under part vii

of the Act.

If the Petitioner believes that the order of the learned Magistrate

allowing the writ of possession dated 11.12.2008 is bad in law the correct

remedy would have been to move in revision. The same Court ca~not sit

on appeal on an order made by the predecessor. The learned Magistrate

has come to the finding that the former Magistrate has made an order that

EIi

I

l II

a writ of possession cannot be issued in this case but the learned

Magistrate who assumed duties thereafter has issued the writ of

possession though he cannot issue it. Therefore the learned Magistrate

was of the view that the Court has made a mistake in issuing the writ of

possession and on the premise of rectifying the mistake of Court he

ordered to restore the possession back which amounts to sitting on appeal

where he has no jurisdiction to do so.

The contention of the Petitioner is that the order of the learned

Magistrate to issue the writ of possession is per incuriam. An order to be

per incuriam, it should have been made in ignorance of or in forgetfulness

of a statutory provision or a binding authority.([1979] 1 Sri L R 10

Billimoria v. Minister of Lands And Land Development & Mahaweli

Development and others) The learned Magistrate in his order dated

05.03.2009 has not considered any of the those matters. He has come to

the finding on the basis that his predecessor who made the determination

has refused to issue the writ.

Under section 68 of the Primary Court Procedure Act a writ of

possession can be issued on certain instances. Section 68 (3) and (4)

provide for issuing writ of possession. That is if there is a dispossession

within two months immediately prior to the filing of the action and if the

judge considers that it is necessary to issue a writ. In Kayas v. Nazeer

and others (supra) it was held that the Court has the inherent power to

issue writ if there is a conviction for contempt of Court for violating the

order not to disturb the possession. In the present case the Petitioner was

charged for contempt of Court for violating the order and the case IS

pending. The Respondent is complaining that the disturba~ce IS

continuing. In such a situation issuing a writ of possession cannot be

considered as per incuriam. A higher Court can consider whether there is

7

a miscarriage of justice by issuing a writ of possession, not the same

Court.

Under these circumstances I see no reason to interfere with the

finding of the learned High Court Judge.

Appeal dismissed. Parties to bear their own costs.
