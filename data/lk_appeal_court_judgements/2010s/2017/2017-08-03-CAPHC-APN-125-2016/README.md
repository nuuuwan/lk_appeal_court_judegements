ORDER

P Padman Surasena J

The Divisional Secretary, of Gangawata Korale, Kandy who has been

named in this petition as the Complainant - Respondent - Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Respondent) had issued a quit

notice on the Respondent - Petitioner - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Petitioner), in terms of section 3 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Act).

As the petitioner had failed to respond to the said quit notice the 1st

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

to the Magistrate's Court of Kandy seeking an order to evict the Petitioner

from the relevant land.

Learned Magistrate thereafter had afforded the Petitioner an opportunity to

submit any valid permit or any other written authority of the State; he may

have had, regarding his possession of the said land. As no such document

was produced, learned Magistrate by his order dated 2005-05-22, had

made an order under section 10 (1) of the Act evicting the Petitioner

forthwith from the said premises.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate of

Kandy, the Petitioner had filed a revision application in the Provincial High

Court in Kandy expecting a revision of the learned Magistrate's order.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, had by its judgment dated

2016-06-09 proceeded to dismiss the said revision application, as it had not

found any illegality in the learned Magistrate's order.

,

5

It is against that judgment that the Petitioner has filed this revision

application in this Court.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner in his submissions sought to impugn the

order of the learned Magistrate as well as that of the learned High Court

Judge on the basis that they were misdirected themselves on the contents

of section 18 of the Act. Further it was the submission of the learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner that the proper competent authority

to file this application should have been the General Manager of Railways

and not the Divisional Secretary. He relied on section 18 of the Act.

Section 18, which defines certain terms in the Act, defines the term

"Competent authority" as follows;

"Competent authority" used in relation to any land means the Government

Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant Government Agent

of the district in which the land is situated. This section has gone on to

include a long list of other authorities also as competent authority for the

purposes of the Act. The General Manager of Railways, where such land is

under the control of the Railway Department; is also amongst that list.

6

A closer look at the scheme of the section shows that in any case it is

primarily the Government Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an

Assistant Government Agent of the district in which the land is situated

should be the competent authority. The other officials in the list are found

as an addendum. Therefore the fact that they are also named as

competent authority does not take away the power anyway granted to

Government Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant

Government Agent by section 18 of the Act since it has specifically been

mentioned therein.

Submission by the learned President's Counsel that the 1st Respondent is

barred from filing this application in view of section 188 and 314 of the

Code of Criminal procedure Act cannot be accepted as this is not a case in

which the Petitioner had been charged in the Magistrate's Court.

It is therefore the view of this Court that there is no basis for this Court to

issue notices on the respondents in this application.

f I I

Thus, this Court decides to refuse issuing notices on the Respondents and

proceed to dismiss this application. This Court makes no order with regard

to costs.

Application is dismissed without costs.
