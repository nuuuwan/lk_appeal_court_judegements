This is an application seeking the grant of an intern order in terms of prayer

Cf) to the Petition.

Heard Counsel for the Petitioner and Counsel for the 1 S\ 2nd and 10th

Respondents to the Petition.

The Petitioner contends that they became aware of the 10th Respondent

seeking to build a condominium building of 6 floors, including the ground floor. at

premises bearing assessment No.6, Atapattu Rd, Dehiwala, in violation of the

Urban Development Authority publication titled "Planning and Building

Regulations, 2008-2020" marked P 12. Reference is made to schedule 8 marked P

12 (b) of the said publication which contains the Specifications for the maximum

! I ,Ii IlI!IIIJi i I l IIIf Ii f t I I l

number of floors in terms of regulations 32.4 (A) of the said publication, which is

applicable within the 1 sl Respondent Municipal Council area.

In terms of the said regulation marked P 12 (b), the minimum Road width

required for the construction of a building consisting of 6 floors (ground floor plus

5 floors) is 6 meters.

Plan bearing No. 3142 dated 16/0112017 marked P 13 depicts Atapattu

Road starting from Quarry Road. According to the said plan Atapattu Road does

not at any point have a width of 6 meters as required for the construction of a

building of a ground floor plus 5 floors.

The Petitioner contends that the premises bearing assessment No.6 where

the Development is taking place, the Road width is 5.10 meters and therefore by

granting approval for the said building the 151 and 2nd Respondents have acted

unlawfully.

The 10th Respondent in their statement of limited objections states that

approval was granted to construct 15 apartment units in a total of six floors

including the ground floor car park was approved in accordance with the

applicable planning and building Regulations. The 10th Respondent in the said

limited objections has marked and produced as A 2 (a) survey plan No. 4473

which shows that the street lines of Atapattu Road is 30 feet (9.144 meters) wide.

In the said survey plan marked A 2. the street line along Atapattu Road

adjacent to the proposed development area bearing assessment No. 6 can be

clearly observed as 30 feet (9.144 meters). "Street Line" in the regulations marked

P 12 is defined as "a line or lines defined on one or both sides of any street,

existing to show its future width or to shmv the width of a future street.. ....... :"

As pointed out earlier. the requirement contemplated in schedule 8 of the

regulations marked P 12 (a), is regarding the minimum Road width for the

construction of a building. Therefore a street line width cannot be considered as

satisfying the condition of the minimum road width required to construct a

building as contemplated, in terms of schedule 8 of the regulations marked P 12

(b).

In terms of the said schedule the mmllTIUm Road width required to

Developments with 6 t100rs (ground t100r plus 5 t1oors) is 6 meters, as such the

permit holder has failed to satisfy the said requirement.

Accordingly we are the view that the Petitioners have established a prima

facia case to grant an Interim order as prayed for. Accordingly the interim order

sought in terms of prayer (t) is granted.
