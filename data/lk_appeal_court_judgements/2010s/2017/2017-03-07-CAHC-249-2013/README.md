Account bearing No. 8400006939 In the Commercial

Bank.

As per indictment the charges are as follows;

1. On or about 29th November 2011 the accused

had deceived the complainant and made her to

deposit a sum of US$ 9400, In the said

Account, stating that the said money to be

utilised for the purpose of purchasing a Fishing

Boat.

2. Between 01.12.2011 to 31.12.2011 the Accused

had induced the complainant to deposit a sum

of US$ 26,200, in the said Account for the

purpose of commencing a fisheries industry.

As the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges

the trial judge proceeded to trial.

It IS the contention of the Accused - Appellant, that

the said money was sent to the accused by the

complainant not for the purpose of purchasing a

fishing boat to commence a fisheries industry, but for

the purpose of building a house for the complainant,

to stay when ever she comes to Sri Lanka.

deed it IS said that In the evidence surfaced In the

trial no material was establish to prove that value of

the fishing boat and the amount of money needed

for the fishing industry. Therefore it IS the categorical

position of the Accused - Appellant that there was no

inducement or compulsion by him for the complainant

to deposit a sum of US$ 26,200, and US$ 9400 in

the said account of the Accused - Appellant.

In addition it IS said the above money was sent as

a donation. This position con tradicts the earlier

position of transfer of this money was to build a

house for the complainant to stay whenever she

comes to Sri Lanka.

The complainant in her testimony to court had stated

that the Accused - Appellant had suggested of a

business which IS more lucrative and could earn

10,000 US$ for a month, and more so the Accused

also had spoken about the Fishing Industry. Further

her evidence reveals that she was not familiar with

the Fishing Industly, and it was at the behest of

the Accused that she had invested this money in the

said industry. In addition it is said that the Accused

had taken her to the Beruwala Fishing Harbour, to

convince her of the said business.

It IS evident from her testimony that the entire

transaction did revolve around the Fishing Industry,

and when it was not materialising, the complainant

demanded the money from the Accused and it was

at that point the accused had threatened to kill her.

In the course of cross examination it was suggested

by the defence that as per documents marked X3 andX4 IS clearly stated that the money has been

sent as a donation, which position has been denied

by the complainant.

It was the position of the defence that the said

money was utilized to build a house for her. If that

was the genuIne intention of the Accused - Appellant

should have written the house and property In her

name. But it was the categorical position that she

never sent the money for the purpose of building a

house for her. Moreover she was never shown the

house that was built for her. It IS salient to note

that there IS absolutely no material to establish that

the complainant has sent money to build a house

for her. But the complainant's evidence In court was

to the effect that the said money was sent to the

Accused - Appellant has been established with cogent

evidence. She has gIVen a vivid description of the

incidents which led her to believe that her money

will be utilized for the purpose of purchasing a

fishing boat for the Fishing Industry. Therefore this

Court IS of the VIew that the Learned High Court

Judge was compelled to accept her evidence, as it is

unassailable.

The above Section under which the Accused IS

indicted is reproduced herein below;

Section 403

"Whoever cheats by and thereby dishonestly induces a

person deceived to deliver any property to any person

or to make, alter, or destroy the whole or any part

of a valuable security, or anything which IS capable

of being converted to a valuable security, shall be

punished with imprisonment of either description for a

term which may extend to seven years, and shall

also be liable to fine."

After the trial the Learned High Court Judge found

the Accused - Appellant guilty and imposed the

following sentences.

Had imposed a fine of Rs.20,000j for each count,

and carrying a default sentence of one year AND

For 7 years Rigorous Imprisonment for the 18t count

And

For 7 years Rigorous Imprisonment for the 2nd count

The counsel for the Accused - Appellant also stressed

the fact the sentence imposed on the Accused-

Appellant is too exceSSIve.

Court see no reason to reduce the jail term imposed

by the High Court Judge to a lesser period. Hence

the contention of the counsel for the Accused-

Appellant

rejected.

1S devoid of merits and should stand

It is also contended by the Counsel for the Accused

- Appellant that the charges 1n the indictment are

defective as there are two counts for the same

offence, but it 1S seen that the Accused - Appellant

had accepted money on two occasions.

The Section 174 of the Criminal Procedure Code has

explicitly stated thus and answer to the above 1S

clearly sets out herein below;

" when a person 1S accused of more offences than

one of the same kind committed within the space

of twelve months from first to the last of such

offences he may be charged with and tried at one

trial for any number of them not exceeding three,

and 1n trials before the High Court such charges

may be included 1n one and the same indictment".

In answenng the stance taken by the Accused-

Appellant the counsel for the Respondent, in respect

of the nature of the alleged transaction it is

categorically stated that the transaction was not one

of a donation but for the purpose of investing in

the Fishing Industry. It is established that the afore

said transaction is not a donation but in order to

has categorised the subject transaction as

one of a donation.

Further it is abundantly clear the purported

transaction was not a civil transaction as claimed by

the counsel for the Accused - Appellant as there was a

criminal intention on the part of the Accused-

Appellant to induce the complainant to transfer money

to his account. Therefore the criminal element on the

part of the accused- appellant is well established by

the attended circumstances as stated before.

As a comprehensive response to the final ground of

appeal, viz a viz the failure on the part of the Learned

Trial Judge to evaluate the evidence of the defence.

The contention of the learned DSG was that, it was

the Learned Trial Judge had the benefit of observing

the demeanour and deportment of the witnesses

namely the complainant and the Accused - Appellant,

and it is trite law that such evaluation after

observation shall not be lightly disturbed in appeal.

As per evidence of the complainant it IS abundantly

clear that the prosecution has established and proved

beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused - Appellant

has exhorted the complainant's money by inducing

her to invest In fishing industry, and made her to

believe that the said industry IS a lucrative and

Income generating one. There

for the Accused - Appellant's

IS no evidence except

verSlOn that the said

money was sent to build a house, which house was

never shown to the complainant. In fact there was

no house In existence, and it was only an

imagination of the Accused - Appellant.

It is seen from the sentence imposed by the Learned

High Court Judge that the maxImum punishment of

7 years of Rigorous imprisonment carryIng a default

sentence been given. It is the contention of the counsel

for the Appellant that the said sentence IS excessIve

It was also contended by the Counsel for the

Appellant that documents marked X3 and X4 indicate,:

that the alleged money has been sent as a donation.

But it IS intensely relevant to note that a foreigner

without following the proper procedure. If the said

money according to the Accused - Appellant was sent

as a donation he need not take up the position

that the money was sent for the purpose of

building a house for the Complainant.

In the said back drop this court is of the VIew that

the Learned High Court Judge has arrived at the

correct determination by handing down the judgment

for a conviction.

It IS apposite to note that the prosecution has

proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

We thus, do not find merit in this appeal which IS

accordingly dismissed.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed.
