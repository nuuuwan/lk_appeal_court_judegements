The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of Vavuniya

for possession of 41.86 grams of heroin under section 54 (a) (d) of the

Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance No. 13 of 1984 (as

amended). After trial the appellant was convicted and sentenced to life

imprisonment.

On an information received by the police prosecution witness no. 1

along with some other officers have gone to the house of the appellant,

on approaching the said house prosecution witness no. 1 had seen the

appellant on the front compound. The W.P.C. who had gone with

prosecution witness no. 1 had searched the appellant and found a key to

the house and opened the house and searched the house. Whilst the

house was been searched the appellant had suddenly taken a dress

which was hanging on the clothes line and put it into bucket. The dress

was taken out of the bucket and searched by the prosecution witness no.

1 and found a parcel containing heroin.

The grounds of appeal urged by the learned counsel for the

appellant are as follows. That the version of the prosecution is highly

improbable and that the learned High Court Judge had failed to apply the

test of probability and improbability in evaluating the evidence. The

appellant's counsel submitted that it is highly improbable to believe that

when six police officers were searching a small house for the appellant

to take a dress alleged to have contained heroin in the pocket and put it

in to a bucket. If the appellant took the said dress from the clothes line

and put it into a bucket as claimed by the prosecution this would have

drawn their attention to the dress which is not the conduct of a wrong doer

I find this highly improbable. There are more than enough places in a

house to conceal such articles.

The other ground urged by the learned counsel for the appellant is

that the learned High Court Judge has not considered the contradictions

interse. According to prosecution witness no. 1 the appellant was

searched in front of the said house in his presence and the WPC says

the search was done inside the kitchen which was at the rear side of the

house in order to secure the privacy of the appellant since the other

officers were males.

Prosecution witness no. 1 says the appellant walked up to the door

step and put the dress into the basket but witness Vipul Nandasiri say the

appellant went outside and she was arrested outside the house.

Prosecution witness no. 1 further testified that he did not take the dress

into custody but the WPC stated that the dress was taken into custody

and taken to the police station. The learned High Court Judge has not

considered these glaring contradictions inter se and has not given the

benefit of the doubt to the accused appellant.

yg{jMCA.. In Sumithra Premawansa vs AG 1998 and in Karuppiah

Punkody vs AG CA 11/2005 the test of probability has been discussed

at length.

For the afore said reasons I decide to set aside the judgment dated

23/05/2011 and acquit the accused appellant.

Appeal allowed.
