L.T.B. Dehideniya J. (PICA)

This case was decided on 09.03.2017 and the proceedings were terminated.

The petitioner made an application for a certified copy the judgment

translated in to Sinhala language. Since this Court has no facilities to issue a

translated copy of the proceedings, the Court as a curtsey towards the

litigants, made a request to the Ministry of Justice to make available a

translation of the judgment but was unsuccessful. Thereafter the learned

Counsel supported this matter in the open Court to establish his entitlement

for a translated copy.

The learned Counsel's argument is that a party is entitle for a translated

copy in to his language under the provisions of the Constitution. Counsel

submits that under Article 24(3) of the constitution, a party is entitle for a

translated copy of the record. He admits that the Gazette in force allowing

the superior courts to function in English language. He categorically state

that he is not making any application to hear the case in Sinhala language

but his contention is that the subsidiary legislation cannot override the

provisions of the Constitution his entitlement for a Sinhala translation under

the Constitution remains.

The learned DSG appearing for the Attorney General submits that this

argument involves the interpretation of the Constitution and therefore under

Article 125, this matter has 0 be referred to the Supreme Court for a

determination.

The Article 24 of the Constitution reads thus;

24. (1) Sinhala and Tamil shall be the languages of the courts

throughout Sri Lanka and Sinhala shall be used as the language of

the court situated in all the areas of Sri Lanka except those in any

area where Tamil is the language of administration. The record and

proceedings shall be in the language of the court. In the event of an

appeal from any court records shall also be prepared in the language

of the court hearing the appeal, if the language of such court is other

than the language used by the court from which the appeal is

preferred:

Provided that the Minister in charge of the subject of Justice may,

with the concurrence of the Cabinet of Ministers direct that the

record of any court shall also be maintained and the proceedings

conducted in a language other than the language of the court.

(2) Any party or applicant or any person legally entitled to represent

such party or applicant may initiate proceedings, and submit to court

pleadings and other documents, and participate in the proceedings in

court, in either Sinhala or Tamil.

(3) Any judge, juror, party or applicant or any person legally entitled

to represent such party or applicant, who is not conversant with the

language used in a court, shall be entitled to interpretation and to

translation into Sinhala or Tamil, prOVided by the State, to enable

him to understand and participate in the proceedings before such

court, and shall also be entitled to obtain in such language, any such

part of the record or a translation thereof, as the case may be, as he

may be entitled to obtain according to law.

(4) The Minister in charge of the subject of Justice may, with the

concurrence of the Cabinet of Ministers, issue directions permitting

the use of English in or in relation to the records and proceedings in

any court for all purposes or for such purposes as may be specified

therein. Every judge shall be bound to implement such directions.

(5)In this Article -

"court" means any court or tribunal created and established for the

administration of justice including the adjudication and settlement of

industrial and other disputes, or any other tribunal or institution

exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions or any tribunal or

institution created and established for the conciliation and settlement

of disputes;

''judge'' includes the President. Chairman, presiding officer and

member of any Court; and

"record" includes pleadings, judgments, orders and other judicial and

ministerial acts.

Under Sub Article (3), a party's entitlement can be summarized as follows,

(3) Any ... party ... who is not conversant with the language used in a

court, shall be entitled to translation into Sinhala provided by the

State, to enable him to understand and participate in the proceedings

before such court, and shall also, be entitled to obtain in such

language, any such part of the record or a translation thereof, ....

The first part of this sub Article refers to "enable him to understand and

participate in the proceedings". Therefore his entitlement of a translation is

8

limited for the purpose of participating in the proceedings. The 'proceeding'

is what takes place in a Court. The proceeding in the present case has been

terminated and the petitioner need not or cannot take part in the proceedings

any further. Therefore there is an issue whether the first part of the sub

article has any application to the Petitioner at this stage. The second part of

the said sub article relates to the entitlement of a translation of a part of the

record. According to the interpretation, the judgments and orders include in

to the word 'record'. The judgment or order comes in with the termination

of the proceedings. Therefore whether there is any application of the

limitation in the first part of the sub article to the second part or whether the

Court is obliged to issue a translated copy of the record to a party is in issue.

This being a matter of interpretation of the Constitution, acting under

Article 125 of the Constitution I refer the following question to the Supreme

Court for determination.

Is the Court required to Issue a Sinhala translation of a

Judgment/Order or any part of the record, maintained in English to a

party who state that he ia unable to understand the language of the

Court?

President ofthe Court of Appeal

Shiran Gooneratne J.

I agree.
