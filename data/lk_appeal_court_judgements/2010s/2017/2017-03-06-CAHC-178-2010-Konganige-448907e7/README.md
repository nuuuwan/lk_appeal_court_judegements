Vijith K. Malalgoda PC J

The accused-appellant Konganige Sarath Palitha was indicted before the High Court of Colombo

under section 54 A (c) for the Poisons Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance for being in possession

of 3.18 grams of Diacetyl Morphine. At the conclusion of the trial before the High Court Judge, the

accused above named was convicted on the Indictment and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Being

dissatisfied with the above conviction and sentence the accused had preferred the present appeal

before this court.

During the argument before this court, the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant had raised the

following grounds of appeal,

a) Learned Trial Judge had erred in law by perusing the notes of the information book while

delivering the judgment

b) Learned Trial Judge had erred in law when he failed to evaluate the omissions and

contradiction per se and inter se of the prosecution witnesses

c) Learned Trial Judge had erred in law when he concluded that the accused -appellant had taken

a defence of alibi and failing to afford the opportunity to place evidence before him.

As observed by us the detection referred to the case in hand been conducted by the officers attached to

the Police Narcotic Bureau. At the trial before the High Court, the prosecution had relied on the

I(

evidence of witnesses, Inspector Moses Rangajeewa, Sub-Inspector Karunathilake, Sub Inspector

I I Rajakaruna and Assistant Government Analyst Sandy Rajapakse and closed the prosecution case on

I

17.02.2010. At the conclusion of the prosecution case the accused was explained of his rights by court

and thereafter the accused elected to give evidence from the witness box.

Since the 3rd ground of appeal was based on the evidence given by the accused and subsequent

observation made by court, I would like to analyze the defence evidence at this point.

According to the evidence of Konganige Sarath Palitha the accused in the case in hand, on 2nd March

2004 he was arrested by the officers of Police Narcotic Bureau while he was at home around 3.30 pm

and at the time of the said arrest he did not have any illegal substance with him. Subsequent to his

arrest he was taken to the Police Narcotic Bureau and a statement was recorded from him. He was

produced before the Magistrate's Court on the following day and prior to him being taken to the

Magistrate's Court, he was asked to keep his thumb impression on a piece of paper. The accused had

claimed, that apart from the said acts, nothing took place between them and submitted that no

detection took place as claimed by the prosecution.

In this regard this court is mindful of the evidence of witnesses Rangajeewa and Karunathilake who

conducted the raid at Seevali Lane off Baseline Road around 11.30 in the mid night. As observed by

us the ground of appeal raised by the Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant refers to an

observation made by the Learned Trial Judge at the conclusion of the evidence given by the accused-

appellant. When the examination in chief and cross examination of the accused-appellant was

concluded the Learned Trial Judge had made the following observation with regard to the evidence of

the accused-appellant (at page 133)

In the said observation, the Learned Trial Judge had made a remark that the accused had failed to

follow the provisions under Act No 14 of 2005 since he had taken a defence of alibi, by not giving

proper notice.

However as observed by this court, the defence taken up by the accused-appellant cannot be

considered as a defence of alibi since, what the accused had said was that, he was arrested by the

officers of Police Narcotic Bureau around 3.30 pm at the house. In a defence of alibi the position the

accused is expected to take is that he could not have committed the offence as alleged by the

prosecution, since he was elsewhere at that time. That is a specific defence taken by an accused person

and in such a situation the law requires him to give notice of such defence. But in the case in hand the

accused did not deny the arrest but states that he was not arrested at 11.30 pm but was arrested 3.30

pm at the house, but at the time his arrest he did not possess anything illegal and therefore it appears to

us that this is a defence of denial and not a defence of alibi.

However as further observed by us, by making the said observation no prejudice has been caused to

the Accused Appellant for the following reasons,

a) Mter the said observation was recorded the defence had closed its case.

b) The said observation was made at the conclusion of the accused's evidence and he was not

prevented by court of giving any evidence

c) In his judgment, the Leaned Trial Judge had not made any remarks with regard to the

observation he made.

Even though we hold that the Learned Trial Judge was misdirected when he made an observation that

the defence taken up by the accused is one of alibi, for the forgoing reasons we are not inclined to

uphold the objection raised on behalf of the accused appellant.

As observed by us, the 151 and the 2nd grounds of appeal raised by the Accused Appellant are

interwoven each other for the reason that both the said grounds deals with certain issues, as to how the

Trial Judge had analyzed the prosecution evidence. When making the submissions on the pI ground of

appeal, the Learned Counsel for the Accused Appellant was critical of the conduct of the Learned Trial

Judge when he decided to peruse the notes of the information book in his Judgment.

In this regard our attention was drawn to the following two paragraphs of the Judgment;

The above conduct of the Learned Trial Judge will have to be analyzed with the relevant provisions of

the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979.

Section 110 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 reads thus;

"Any criminal court may send for the statements recorded in a case under inquiry or trial in such court

and may use such statements or information, not as evidence in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry or

trial ...... "

The use of the above provisions in order to peruse the infonnation book was widely discussed by our

courts on several occasions.

In the case of Sheela Sinharage V. Attorney General (1985) 1 Sri LR 1 Supreme Court held that

section 110 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 empowers the High Court Judge

to use a statement made at a non-summary proceeding to aid him at the trial but it was further held that

it cannot be used as evidence in the case.

The above position taken by the Supreme Court was discussed at length by Jayasuriya J in the case of

Keerthi Bandara V. Attorney General (2000) 2 Sri LR 245 and observed as follows;

" ....... In Sinharage's case the Learned High Court Judge proceeded to peruse the evidence given at

the non-summary inquiry by Dr. Wass in regard to a statement made by the deceased to him and the

trial judge wrongly and illegally used the matter recorded at the non-summary inquiry as substantive

evidence to arrive at his findings on the issue in the case and for his adjudication, without taking any

steps to have such material placed before him as evidence. In those circumstances, Justice Ranasinghe

very correctly held that the procedure that was adopted was wholly illegal and unjustifiable in law.

The process that we are advocating is certainly not the use of the statements as substantive evidence.

The evidence of a witness is assailed as being testimonially untrustworthy on an account of an alleged

vital omission, the trial judge or the Court of Appeal merely looks into the statement, interprets that

statement and thereafter decides whether there is a vital omission as urged by counsel? In indulging in

such a process certainly both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal are not using the contents of the

statements as substantive evidence to detennine the issues arising in the case. Both courts are looking

into the statements only to ascertain whether there is a vital omission.

When considering the observation made by the Leaned Trial Judge in page 147 of his Judgment, I

would first like to consider the evidence given by the two witnesses Rangajeewa and Karunathilake

with regard to the detection that took place on 02.03.2004. According to the evidence of witness

Rangajeewa on the day in question around 11.20 he had left the Police Narcotic Bureau with a

police party on an information received through PS 37732 Karunathilake to Wanathamulla area. When

the police party reached Seevali lane on Baseline Rd closer to the Railway ground, the witness had got

down from the vehicle with PS 37732 to meet the informant who was at the entrance to Seevali Lane.

On his direction, the two officers followed him through Seevali Lane.

The next Question and Answer recorded in the proceedings reads as follows, (page 43)

When going through the said evidence of witness Rangajeewa, it is clear that the position taken by the

witness with regard to the dress worn by the accused was a white sarong and a white shirt and the blue

bag containing heroin was recovered from the left shirt pocket.

However, under cross examination the witness had taken up a deferent position and the answers given

by him had been recorded as follows,

The above position taken by witness Rangajeewa under cross examination was further established by

witness Karunathilake as follows,

In the said circumstances, it is observed that the position taken by witness Rangajeewa under cross

examination was corroborated by witness Karunathilake and therefore the Learned Trial Judge when

going through the notes of Rangajeewa had not used the notes of Rangajeewa as substantive evidence

in this case but that was used to make sure whether there was in fact a contradiction in the evidence of

witness Rangajeewa or not.

The observation made by the trial judge with regard to WPC Sunila, we observe that the failure by

Rangajeewa to make notes with regard to Sunila in his notes, was clarified by the trial judge in order

to consider the omission in the evidence of Rangajeewa. After going through the notes of Rangajeewa,

Karunathilake and Sunila the court had concluded that the said omission does not go to route of the

case. The Learned Trial Judge had not considered the notes of Karunathilake and Sunil a as evidence in

this case but only made use of it to consider the said omission only. The evidence that confirms

Sunila's presence was established by the oral evidence of witness Rangajeewa and Karunathilake.

In these circumstances, we see no merit in the 1st Argument raised on behalf of the accused-appellant

to the effect that the trial Judge erred in Law by perusing the Information Book Extracts when

delivering the Judgment.

As the 2nd ground of appeal the learned Counsel once again drew our attention to the judgment and

argued that the Learned Trial Judge had erred in law by failing to properly evaluate the omissions and

contradictions observed in this case.

As observed above, the Learned Trial Judge was correct and was entitled under law to go through the

Information Book Extracts in considering some of the contradictions and omissions in the case in

10

hand. In addition to the above contradictions and omissions our attention was drawn to the evidence

given by the said witnesses with regard to the recovery of the production from the custody of the

accused-appellant.

In this regard, we observe that witness Rangajeewa had referred to the recovery of productions in his

evidence as follows;

Page 44,

but under cross examination, his evidence with regard to the recovery was recorded as follows;

Witness Karunathilake whilst giving evidence had referred to the recovery as follows;

Whilst referring to the above evidence with regard to the recovery of the productions, the appellant

had argued before us that the learned trial judge had erred in law when he failed to evaluate the said

evidence which is contradictory per se in the evidence of witness Rangajeewa and inter se with the

evidence of Karunathilake.

However as observed by us, witness Rangajeewa in examination in chief, had taken up the position

that the blue cellophane bag containing heroin was recovered from the left side shirt pocket but under

cross examinations whilst referring to his notes had said, "@<35 O()CS)~a@ 6)@Q)~a) (!l~@<35 at!)

Even though the Learned Trial Judge had gone through the Information Book Extracts with regard to

the notes made in respect of the dress worn by the accused and the participation of WPC Sunila, the

trial judge had not made any observation with regard to the notes made in respected of the recovery.

As observed above, section 110 (4) of Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 provides, to

use such statement or information not as evidence in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry or trial,

and in the case of Keerthi Bandara V. Attorney General (2000) 2 Sri LR 245 at page 259 powers

given to the trial judge or the Court of Appeal by the above provision was discussed by Jayasuriya (J)

as follows;

"The evidence of a witness is assailed as being testimonially untrustworthy on an account of an

alleged vital omission, the Trial Judge or the Court of Appeal merely looks into the statement,

interprets that statement and thereafter decides whether there is a vital omission as urged by the

counsel? In indulging in such a process certainly by both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal are

not using the contents of the statements as substantive evidence to determine the issues arising the

case. Both courts are looking into the statements only to ascertain whether there is a vital mission.

In the said circumstances, we observe that this court too is empowered by the said section to go

through the Information Book Extracts, not as evidence but to aid it in the case before this court.

In this regard, what is necessary to consider by this court is that whether the contradiction per say with

regard to the recovery of the production, goes to the route of the case or can be ignored by us. When

going through the Information Book Extracts we observe that witness Rangajeewa had made two

entries, one as the return entry and the other as the detailed arrest notes and in both those notes he had

recorded that he recovered the blue colored cellophane bag from the left shirt pocket of the accused.

In these circumstances, it is observed by us that the failure by the trial judge to consider the said

contradiction had not prejudice the defence case.

The Learned Counsel for the accused-appellant drew our attention to the evidence of witness

Karunathilake recorded at page 93, to the effect,

And argued that the term "t;:n/!lo@/!l" referred to in the said answer was to be interpreted as a trouser

but not as a shirt.

However, in this regard we observe that, witness Karunathilake was consistent in his evidence and had

repeatedly said that the bag containing heroin was recovered from the shirt pocket and not from the

trouser pocket. Even in the answer referred to above he referred to a "cc) o)d~C)c)" (top pocket)

which is only found in a shirt but not in a trouser and in these circumstances, we see no merit in the

said argument raised on behalf of the accused-appellant.

For the forgoing reasons, we see no merit in any of the arguments raised on behalf of the accused-

appellant before this court. We therefore dismiss the appeal and the affirm the conviction and sentence

imposed on the accused-appellant.

Appeal dismissed. Conviction and sentence is affirmed.
