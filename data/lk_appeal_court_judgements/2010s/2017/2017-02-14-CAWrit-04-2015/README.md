The petitioner has submitted an application together with a character certificate alleged to have issued by 'Peace Welfare', Nuwaragampalatha East, Divisional Secretariat stage 2, Anuradhapura. It was found that the said address belongs to a divisional secretarial and such institution does not exist there. There was a complaint to the special investigation unit of Anuradhapura Police and was, in turn, reported to the magistrate of Anuradhapura under the B report number 3739/13. It is noted that the complaint was made for making a false

document after the investigation it was found that there is no evidence that the petitioner had not made the document accordingly the petitioner was discharged from the case.

In the meantime, there was another complaint made against the petitioner that he had

obtained Rs.500,OOO/- from Niyaz Mohamed Salman in the pretext of sending him to England. The petitioner pleaded not guilty to the charge but accepted to refund the money.

Accordingly, the petitioner paid Rs.500,OOO/- and the case bearing number B3637/13 was settled and the petitioner was discharged on the 19th December 2014.

There was an inquiry held against the petitioner at the Ministry of Justice on the 9th April

2014 for submitting wrong information to the Ministry of Justice and accepting money from N.M.Salman, findings and recommendations were submitted to the 2nd Respondent, by

report dated 04/11/2009. There, it was recommended by the inquirer that the petitioner is unfit person to hold the office of inquirer into sudden death, the said proceedings and report were submitted by the respondent marked R6.

At the inquiry against the petitioner, he had made a statement and admitted that the said character letter issued institution was not existent at the given address. It further noticed that the petitioner had admitted that he was the Treasurer of the said organisation.

The petitioner also admitted that his information of working at Gabman Solicitors Irish (sic) in London does not exist. Among other admissions the petitioner also admitted repaying

Rs.500,OOO/- to Mohamed Salman.

The inquirer who was appointed by the 2nd respondent after the inquiry had come to the finding that the petitioner had submitted documents which are incorrect and contradictory to accepted norms. Further, the petitioners obtained money in the false pretence and

repaid the same after the complaint was made to police and courts.

The inquirer opinioned that the office of sudden death inquirer in a respectable post and it requisites honesty and example to others.

The inquirer had finally concluded that after considering the materials at the investigation that Mr. M.F.M. Munawwar the petitioner is unfit to hold the office of sudden death inquirer.

Petitioner contents in his argument that he was acquitted in the first Magistrate Court case

bearing number 3739/13; hence he has a legitimate expectation to be taken back to the services.

The learned Senior D.S.G submitted that the case before the Magistrate was for "making a

false document", but the inquiry was for submitting wrong information to the appointing

authority, and accepting money from Salman in the pretext of sending him to United Kingdom (without any legal authorization). The Petitioner was found guilty after proper

inquiry accordingly his services was terminated.

Normally the inquest is conducted by the magistrate of the respective area. The Sudden

Death Inquirer conducts inquiry on matters where the Magistrates allow them to do so. I

mentioned this for the reason that in the eyes of the public Sudden Death Inquirer also honored as a judicial officer (not officially). Therefore the holder of this esteemed office should be above of all suspicion and behave himself in a very dignified manner.

Considering the available facts before the court we are of the view that the decision of the

2nd respondent is reasonable, proper and legal hence we conclude that it need not be quashed.

After careful consideration, this court is of the view that the petitioner is not entitled for a Writ of Certiorari and Writ of Mandamus hence we refuse to grant the same.

Writ of Certiorari and Writ of Mandamus refused no cost ordered.

Application dismissed.
