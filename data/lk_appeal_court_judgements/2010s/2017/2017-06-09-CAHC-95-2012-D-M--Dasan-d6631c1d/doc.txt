CASE- NO- CA-95- 2012 - ORDER- 06.06.2017

P.R. Walgama, J

The instant order concerns the preliminary objection raised

by the counsel for the Accused - Appellant as to the

maintainability of the appeal by the Hon. Attorney General

as to the sentence imposed by the Learned High Court

Judge, on the premis that it IS grossly inadequate in the

back drop of the circumstances stated therein.

The Accused - Appellant too has impugned the conviction

and the sentence d8.ted 05.07.2012. These two appeals

are amalgamated under the present case number

CA 95/2012.

The Accused - Appellant was charged and was indicted

for having caused the death of one Don Pathamasiri

Samarajeewa on or about 17/10/2002, punishable under

Section 296 of the Penal Code.

At the conclusion of the trial the Learned High Court

Judge acquitted the Accused - Appellant of the charge

of murder and convicted him culpable homicide not

amounting to murder and imposed a sentence of 12

years of Rigorous Imprisonment, and a fine of Rs.

10,000/-carrying a default term of 6 mon ths of

imprisonmen t accordingly.

It IS the

Appellant

contention of the counsel

that the Attorney - General

for the Accused-

cannot prefer the

instant appeal in terms of Section 15 of the Judicature

Act without filing an application for leave to appeal.

2

The above Section 15 IS reproduced for easy reference

here under;

"The Attorney - General may appeal to the Court of

Appeal in the following cases;

(a) From an order of acquittal by a High Court,

(i)on a question of law alone or on a trial with or

without a JUry,

(ii)on a question of fact alone or on a question of

mixed law and fact with leave of the Court of Appeal

first had and obtained in a trial without a JUry.

(b)In all cases on the ground of inadequacy or illegality

of the sentence imposed or illegality of any other

order of the High Court.

Therefore it is the categorical position of the Counsel

for the Accused - Appellant as the Learned High Court

Judge has acquitted the Accused -Appellant from the

charge of murder and convicted him for culpable homicide

not amounting to murder, the Attorney - General should

come by way of leave to appeal, and not by way of

a direct appeal.

To fortify the above position the counsel for the Accused

- Appellant has adverted this court to the case of AG

.vs. D.S.J.A. Jayamaha, (decided on 10.06.2009, bearing No:

CALA- 321/2006) wherein it opined by Their Lordships

that an acquittal of the charge of murder and convict

for a lesser offence vito culpable homicide not amounting

3

to murder, is for all purposes IS an acquittal wherein

the Attorney - General is entitled to get leave of court

tendering an appeal.

The said principle was encompassed In the case of

KISHAN SINGH .VS. EMPERIOR-AIR 1928 Privy Council

page- 254.

As per contra the Learned DSG has urged In confutation

that the present application by the Attorney - General IS

made under Section 15 (b) of the Judicature Act. The

above subsection deals with a situation where the

sentence imposed is inadequate or illegal.

It was the contention of the Learned DSG, that the

Attorney - General has lodged the instant appeal for an

enhancement of the sentence of culpable homicide not

amounting murder by replacing the sentence for murder,

and not against an acquittal as contemplated in Section

15 (a) of the Judicature Act, but on the basis of the

said sentence is grossely inadequate in the circumstances.

But it IS apparent that the Accused - Appellant was

charged for murder, and after the conclusion of the trial

he was found guilty for culpable homicide not amounting

to murder. It was the observation of Their Lordships in

the Royal Park case that in such situation that the

trial Judge has to acquit the accused of the charge of

murder and convict him for a lesser offence of culpable

homicide not amounting to murder, which is an acquittal

4

within the interpretation of Section

Judicature Act.

15(1) of the

Thus in the said back drop it is abundantly clear that

the Attorney - General should have appealed against the

acquittal of the former charge by first having obtained

leave from court.

For the afore said reasons this court is persuaded to up

hold the preliminary objection, and dismiss the appeal of

the Attorney - General.
