Order

H. C. J. Madawala , J

This Revision Application has been filed by the 8th Respondent-

Respondent-Petitioner to dismiss the revision application of the pt

Respondent and to set aside Ivacate the impugned order dated 3/2/2016 of

the High Court of Kandy in case bearing No. HC Rev 49/2010 and to

restore the order of the Learned Magistrate of He1boda in case bearing No.

24799 and for further relief as prayed for in the prayer of the petition dated

18/2/2016.

The position of the Petitioner was that the Complainant-Respondent filed

an information before Magistrates Court of Helboda bearing No. 24799

called RB Division, 50 Acres Division and New Division of Ramboda

Estate against the 1st Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent, 2nd Respondent-

Respondent, 3rd Respondent-Respondent in terms of section 66 of the

Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1978. This estate consist of about

837 Acres. This Estate had been taken over by the Land Reform

Commission, but later had been transferred back to the children of the

original owner. The 4th,5th,6th,7th Respondents-Respondents-Respondents

and 8th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner intervened in to the said

Primary Court case. After the demise of the original owner the property

had been managed by one Padmanadan and he had entered in to an

agreement with the Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd and later he had created

a false Power of Attorney and has transferred the title of the land to

Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd. But later the Petitioner has filed action in

the District Court and has got the power of Attorney canceled and the

alleged deed declared null and void.

The 1 st Respondent who is a contesting party in this matter purportedly

claimed possession to the subject matter in the said action in the Magistrate

Court. The 1 st Respondent contention is that he has been in possession of

the entirety of the subject matter since September 2007.

It was contended that the 1 st Respondent is a power of Attorney holder of

one Periyanpillei Govindasamy who claimed to be the owner ofthe subject

matter. The 1 st Respondent further contended that he being the said power

of Attorney holder of said Govindasamy instituted an action bearing No

2487/L in the District Court of Gampola against the Petitioner and

Kaliappapillai Padmanadan where in the 1 st Respondent and his principal

were purportedly placed in possession of the entirety of the subject matter.

The subject matter consisted of two plots of lands respectively A:27, R:2,

P:39 and A:24 R:O P: 17.30 the total estate consisting of 52 Acres as

depicted in the second schedule to the ex parte decree in the said case No

24871L.

The 1 st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the Petitioner having obtained an ex-

parte decree in the said District Court case bearing No 24871L had executed

the writ and obtained possession of the subject matter. However the 1 st

Respondent had not served the ex-parte decree against the Petitioner prior

to the execution of the ex-parte decree. The rest of the subject matter of

this application was delivered to the Petitioner through the 2nd Respondent

who was then the director of the Petitioner subject to the following rights

for possession of the other Respondents. 4th Respondent 14 Acres, 5th

Respondent 25 Acres, 6th Respondent 58 Acres and 9 perches, 7th

Respondent 65 Acres. Being aggrieved by the said order of the Learned

Magistrate of Helboda dated 3/2/2010 the 1 st Respondent after more than

6 months from the said order made an application by way of revision to the

High Court ofKandy. While the matter was pending in the High Court the

2nd Respondent departed this life and his widow Raja Rajeshwari was

substituted in the room of deceased 2nd Respondent.

It was contended that the Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the

delay of the Petitioner in making the revision application. Further the 15t

Respondent has failed to disclose exceptional circumstances in his

application for revision which could warrant the High Court to exercise in

revisionary jurisdiction.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the High Court of Kandy the Petitioner

moved that this court exercise the revisionary jurisdiction and pleaded to

set aside the order of the High Court of Kandy dated 3/2/2016 of the

grounds stated in paragraph 28 of the petition.

The 15t Respondent-Respondent-Respondent's position was that the

Petitioner has no locus standi to institute and maintain this application.

Further the Petitioner has suppressed from and/or misrepresented material

facts which were within his knowledge. The Learned Magistrate by his

order dated 3/2/2010 had granted possession to several Respondents, but

the Petitioner was not granted possessory rights whatsoever therefore he is

not an aggrieved party to seek the revisionary jurisdiction. Further that the

Petitioner has failed to give notice of this application to the 15t Respondent

in terms of rule 2(1) and 2(2) ofthe Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure)

Rules 1990 and as the averments contained in the Petition of the Petitioner

are diametrically opposite to the prayer of the petitioner pertaining to

possession and as such the Petitioner cannot maintain the said application.

It was the position of the 8th Respondent of Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd

that the Learned Magistrate had not granted possession in the 66

application to the 8th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner or Pushparasa

Sathasivam (the 3rd Respondent) who is a Director of Ram bod a Tea Estate.

It was contended that the 8th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner being

aggrieved party has filed this revision application. However neither

Ramboda Tea Estate nor is director Pushparasa Sathasivam sought to

revise the order of the Magistrate. In the circumstances it was submitted

that the Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd has no locus standi to revise the

order of the Learned High Court Judge ofKandy.

The Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd in Helboda case No 24871L and the

Gampola DC case No. 35341L sought orders from court that it is Ramboda

Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd that had possession. However both the Magistrate

Court in section 66 case as well as the District Judge in DC Gampola in

case No 35341L did not come to the findings that the Ramboda Tea Estate

(Pvt) Ltd was in possession. Neither Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd seek to

revise the order in case no. 35341L and in fact the said action had now been

dismissed. In the section 66 case the Leamed Magistrate erroneously

handed over possession to Dayalan, but did not hand over possession to

Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd who did not seek to revise the said order at

any stage ofthe High Court revision application and now in this application

9

before the Court of Appeal. Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd is seeking to

argue that possession to Dayalan (2nd Respondent) is in fact possession

given to Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd.

It was submitted that the 8th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner was

managing the subject matter and it was the company that was in control

and was in possession of the estate. The 2nd Respondent and the 3rd

Respondent were only involved in the management under the 8th

Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner Company.

It was submitted that the Learned Magistrate in his order held as follows,

" "

Therefore, the learned Magistrate should have given possession to the

company that is the 8th Respondent and if he wanted to give it to the

directors personally he should have given it to the 2nd Respondent as well

as the 3rd Respondent-Respondent.

It was submitted that the final order directing the 1 st Respondent not to

interfere with the possession of the Respondent seems to have been made

by an oversight. Even pursuing the body of the order, it became very clear

that the intention of the Learned Magistrate was to give the possession to

the company that is the 8th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner.But

10

inadvertently in the final conclusion the Learned Magistrate has mentioned

the 2nd Respondent only. As the result of this mistake now certain

complications have developed. It was submitted the original 2nd

Respondent-Respondent has passed away and his wife has been substituted

in her personal capacity. The wife who is not a director of the company is

now trying to get hold of the control of the estate by using the order made

by the Learned Magistrate. This has created another dispute with regard to

the management of the estate. It was submitted that the 3rd Respondent-

Respondent and the 8th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner that the final

order of the Learned Magistrate should be varied to the extent declaring

that it was the 8th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner company which was

entitled to the possession and the 2nd Respondent- Respondent and the 3rd

Respondent-Respondent's entitlement was only under the 8th Respondent-

Respondent-Petitioner company. However it was submitted that Dayalan

(wife-Vaithalingam Rsjeshwari), Wimaladasa, Shamali Wickramasinghe

and Muzzamil has taken up the position that possession was given to them

in their personal capacity by the Magistrate.

The 7th Respondent in their objections and written submissions in the High

Court has taken up the position that they are holding independently and in

their personal capacity and was not holding under Ramboda Tea Estate

(Pvt) Ltd. It was also submitted in the case of L/3534 aforesaid no

possession has been given to Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd the Plaintiff.

In any event Dayalan ceased to be a Director of Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt)

Ltd after 19th June 2008. In the Magistrates Court inquiry Ramboda Tea

Estate (Pvt) Ltd and its Director Pushparaj Sathasivam the 3rd Respondent

acted jointly and sought possession for Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd.

However the Learned Magistrate in MC Helboda case No. 24799 handed

over possession to Dayalan (2nd Respondent) and Ramboda Tea Estate

(Pvt) Ltd. For the first time in the High Court took up the position that

Dayalan's possession is same as possession of Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt)

Ltd as he was a Director of Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd.

It was submitted this cannot be as Dayalan ceased to be a Director of

Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd on 19th June 2008 well before the dispute.

This position has been taken up by Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd in DC

Colombo case No. DLMl160/2015 at paragraph 16 of the Plaint which was

annexed to the petition of Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd. Similarly,

Dayalan widow substituted in his place as well as all the other Parties who

were given possession by the Learned Magistrate have clearly taken up the

position that Dayalan's possession was independent and separate to that of

Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd.

12

It was submitted that in the circumstances Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd

did not get possession by the order of the Learned Magistrate in MC

Helboda case No. 24799 dated 3rd February 2010. Ramboda Tea Estate

(Pvt) Ltd neither took any steps to seek to revise the order of the Learned

Magistrate. It was submitted that Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd has no

locus standi to challenge the order of the High Court of Kandy which

granted possession to Soundararajan the 1 st Respondent.

When considering the locus standi of the 8th Respondent-Respondent-

Petitioner and the 3rd Respondent-Respondent we find that the said

Pushparaj Sathasiwam who is a director of a 8th Respondent-Respondent-

Petitioner company and 3rd Respondent-Respondent-Respondent together

with 4th,5th,6th and ~h Respondent-Respondents has intervened in the

primary Court case.

Thereafter the Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd failed to get possession by

order dated 3rd February 2010 in the Magistrate Court of Helboda in case

No 24799. We find that this order has been revised by the High Court of

Kandy in n case no. 49/2010. Although Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd has

been defendants in case No. 24799 we fmd that it has lost his rights and

possession by order dated 7/1/2013 in Gampola DC case No 3534. The

enjoining order was suspended by court on 28/3/2008 on the finding that

Soundarajan the 1 st Respondent was in possession subsequently on 7th

i

f

13

January 2013 action dismissed due to no instructions from the Plaintiff.

Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd was not successful in obtaining possession

of the estate despite the above actions. Two months after the refusal of the

enjoining order in case no. 3534/L several instigated and attempted to

disrupt the possession of Soundrajan all attempts and actions by Ramboda

Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd and Dayalan clearly show that neither Ramboda Tea

Estate (Pvt) Ltd nor Dayalan had possession of the land in dispute two

month prior to the in dispute.

At the stage of the High Court revision application and now, in the

application before the Court of Appeal the Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd

sought to argue that possession to Dayalan ( 2nd Respondent) is in fact

given to Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd. In section 66 case no. 3534/L the

Learned Magistrate did not find that Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd was in

possession. Agreement to sell bearing No 852 dated 12th December 2007

Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd entered into an agreement with Sivasambo

(Pvt) Ltd and has placed in possession of the estate .This deed bearing No.

852 has been executed by Dayalan (2nd Respondent) and Pushparaja (3rd

Respondent) on behalf of the Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd. The

Commissioner of Labour delivered his order dated 13th December 2007

Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd and its Director Dayalan were no longer in

possession of the estate.

14

The Petitioner has failed to disclose that it had instituted the aforesaid case

bearing No DC Gampola case No 35341L against the 1 st Respondent and

Govindasamy. The 1 st Respondent stated that the Petitioner had instituted

the said rei vindicatio action after the ex-parte decree and execution of the

writ in DC Gampola case No 2487/L.

In the two cases the courts has refused to recognize the title of this

Petitioner after the 1 st Respondent as well as Petitioner himself put the

Petitioner's title in issue before the said court. At the commencement of

the proceedings in the Magistrate Court the 2nd Respondent was no longer

a director of the Petitioner Company as evidenced by form 20 dated 19

June 2008 of the Petitioner Company. Accordingly we are ofthe view that

the Petitioner had suppressed from 1 and 1 or misrepresented material facts

which were in his knowledge.

The only claim and/or interest Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd to have

deed no 927. However Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd lost his rights by

virtue of the judgments entered in DC Gampola 24871L as well as 35341L.

In addition to the above Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd by agreement

bearing no 852 dated 12/12/2007 has placed Sivasambo (Pvt) Ltd in

possession of the estate on 12/12/2007. This fact has been affirmed by deed

of renunciation bearing no 008 dated 28 April 2012. The Ramboda Tea

Estate (Pvt) Ltd by deed of exchange bearing No 1027 and attested by T.S.

Welianga has transferred all his right title and interest of the entire estate

to the aforesaid Sivasambo (Pvt) Ltd vide para 24 of the plaint in DC

Colombo Case No. DLMl160/2015 marked as "E22" and annexed to the

application of Ramboda Tea Estate (Pvt) Ltd to this court.

soundarajan obtain 52 Acres in terms of decree in case No. 247991L there

was a finding in case no 35341L that Saundaraj possessed the entire estate

soon after the time he obtained possession of 52 acres.

We find that there is a delay of 6 months to file action in the High Court

by the Petitioner. We find that the Learned High Court Judge has not

considered same too.

Accordingly we hold that the 8th Respondent-Respondent-Petitioner

Company has no locus standi any longer to institute and maintain the

present revision application.

As such we dismiss this Revision Application with costs of Rs.50,000I-

each.
