The Appellant in this case is the registered owner of'the truck No. SPLA 1 425(herein after referred to as the vehicle). The accused is the driver oftl)e registered owner (Appellant). The accused committed an offence under the Forest Ordinance. The vehicle in question was taken into custody while transporting illicit timber. The accused was convicted and sentenced. Thereafter the learned Magistrate held an inquiry and made order confiscating the above-mentioned vehicle.

At the production inquiry, the appellant gave evidence. In the examination in chief and stated that there are no previous convictions but in cross examination the appellant admitted that the vehicle was involved in another offence under the forest ordinance. The accused driver is still working for the appellant in another vehicle.

The appellant made an appeal to the High Court against the confiscation order, under appeal No. 869.He also made a revision application to the High Court Numbered Rev. 804.

The appellant has made this appeal against the order of the High COULl. Judge.

The learned counsel for the respondent take up the objection that the present appeal before the Court of Appeal is Appeal upon an Appeal. The first appeal to the High Court, to set aside the confiscation order No. 869.According to the record. There is nothing on record to show that the appeal to the high court was withdrawn. Therefor the order of the High Court is pertaining to the appeal.

In the case ofWickremasinghe Vs OIC Ampara (2004 lSLR 257) held that "the jurisdiction from an appeal in the High Court is to the Supreme Court."

\

In the case of Mary Matilda Silva Vs I.P.Habarana, it was held that "the order of

1j~/.;f~~:~~--5Ik~ __ ~~it~ r, 1 ~e~prOW8~ . _!!') "c~,-~=_ . _~. __ $~, .. -:.g~:-~~::~:"~~I:~:

(1) that she has taken all precautions to prevent the use of the vehicle for the commission of the offence. (2) that the vehicle has been used for the commission of offence without his knowledge. "

4

The appellant has the burden of prove on a balance of probability that he has no knowledge and that he took all necessary steps to prevent the offence being committed. It was further decided that simply telling the driver (the accused) does not amount to a positive step. In this present case, when considering the evidence of the appellant in the Magistrate Court there is no evidence to demonstrate that the appellant has taken any precaution to prevent the offence being committed by the accused or appellant had no knowledge of the offence being committed. Further the appellant has admitted that the vehicle was previously involved in another offence. That itself shows that even after he had taken any precautions to prevent the offence taking place.

The circumstances mentioned above do not constitute exceptional circumstances to urge this court to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction.

Thus, there is no ground to reverse the judgment of the Learned High Court Judge, affirming the order of the Learned Magistrate in confiscation the truck bearing No. SPLA 1425.

Appeal is hereby dismissed.
