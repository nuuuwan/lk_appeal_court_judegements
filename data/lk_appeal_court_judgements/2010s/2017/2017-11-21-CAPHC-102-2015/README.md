JUDGMENT

P Pad man Surasena J

Learned counsel for both parties agreed that the cases namely C A (PHC) /

102/2015 as well as C A (PHC) APN 55/2015 are both cases filed to challenge

one and the same Primary Court order. The former is the appeal and the

latter is the application for revision. Thus, the issues to be decided by this

court in respect of both these cases are the same. Therefore, this judgment

must apply to both the above cases.

5

The Petitioner - Petitioner - Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Appellants) had instituted this case against the Respondent -

Respondent - Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Respondents) in the Primary Court of Kalawana under the Primary Courts

Procedure Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act). The said

case was filed under section 66 (1) (b) of the Act as a private information,

seeking an order declaring that the Appellants are entitled to have the

possession of the impugned land.

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into the complaint, by his

order dated 2010-04-21, had concluded that the Respondents are entitled

to have the possession of the land which is the subject matter of the

dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge, the Appellants had filed an application for revision in the Provincial

High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province holden at Rathnapura seeking a

revision of the order of the Primary Court.

6

The Provincial High Court after hearing had refused the said revision

application on the basis that the findings entered into by the learned

Primary Court Judge is correct.

It is against that judgment of the Provincial High Court that the Appellant

has appealed to this Court.

It was the submission of the learned counsel for the Appellant that the

learned Primary Court Judge had misunderstood and misapplied the

provisions of the Act relevant to this dispute.

It is section 68 (1) of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979

which is relevant to the instant case. It is as follows;

Section. 68

(1) Where the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part

thereof it shall be the duty of the Judge of the Primary Court holding the

inquiry to determine as to who was in possession of the land or the part

on the date of the filing of the information under section 66 and make

order as to who is entitled to possession of such land or part thereof.

'\

7

(2) An order under subsection (1) shall declare anyone or more persons

therein specified to be entitled to the possession of the land or the part

in the manner specified in such order until such person or persons are

evicted there- from under an order or decree of a competent court, and

prohibit all disturbance of such possession otherwise than under the

authority of such an order or decree.

(3) Where at an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right to the

possession of any land or any part of a land the Judge of the Primary

Court is satisfied that any person who had been in possession of the

land or part has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two

months immediately before the date on which the information was filed

under section 66, he may make a determination to that effect and make

an order directing that the party dispossessed be restored to possession

and prohibiting all disturbance of such possession otherwise than under

the authority of an order or decree of a competent court.

(4) An order under subsection (1) may contain in addition to the

declaration and prohibition referred to in subsection (2), a direction that

any party specified in the order shall be restored to the possession of

the land or any part thereof specified in such order.

This Court in the case of Thilak Kumara Udugama V D G Rathnayaka and

three others1 adverted to the several steps that a Court is obliged to follow

in adjudicating a dispute of this nature. This Court in that case held that

when the dispute relates to the possession of any land or part thereof, it

would be desirable for the inquiring Primary Court Judge to adhere to the

following steps in their chronological order;

I. determine as to who was in possession of the land or the part on the

date of the filing of the information under section 66

II. determine whether any person who had been in possession of the

land or part has been forcibly dispossessed within a period of two

months immediately before the date on which the information was

filed under section 66

III. if he is satisfied that a person has been dispossessed as in item II

above, make a determination to that effect and make an order that

the party dispossessed be restored to possession.

----------

1 C A (PHC) / 230 /2001 decided on 2017-10-09.

Further, this Court in an earlier occasion also, in the case of Punchi Nona V

Padumasena and others2 had held as follows;

" Section 68 (1) of the Act is concerned with the determination as to

who was in possession of the land on the date of the filing of the

information to Court. Section 68 (3) becomes applicable only if the Judge

can come to a definite finding that some other party had been forcibly

dispossessed within a period of 2 months next preceding the date on which

the information was filed. . .. "

Therefore the submission made by the learned Counsel for the Appellant

that the learned Primary Court Judge has erred when he determined as to

who was in possession on the date of filing information in Court is

unacceptable. Learned Primary Court Judge had merely exercised the

powers that he is obliged to exercise in terms of section 68 (1). He has

rightly held that there is no dispossession which would warrant an order

under section 68(3) of the Act.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that the learned

Primary Court Judge had correctly identified and applied the law to the set

21994 (2) Sri. L R 117.

10

of facts of this case. Therefore, the learned Provincial high Court Judge has

correctly refused the revision application filed by the Appellant.

Hence this Court decides to affirm both the judgment dated 2010-04-21 of

the Primary Court and the judgment dated 2015-03-18 of the Provincial

High Court and proceed to dismiss this appeal with costs fixed at Rs.

25,000/=.

The revision application filed by the Appellant in respect of the same order

bearing No. C A (PHC) APN 55/2015 should also stand dismissed.

Appeal dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 25,000/=
