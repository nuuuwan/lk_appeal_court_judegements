ORDER

The Petitioner in this case is the Accused of the partly heard trial in High Court Panadura Case

No. 3006/2013.

The Petitioner has been Indicted in the High Court of Panadura for an offence punishable under

sections 54 A l<;) and 54 A (b) for possessing and trafficking of 637.9 grams of heroin.

The Learned High Court Judge had pronounced the order dated 28th March 2016 refusing to

grant bail on the Accused Petitioner. Being aggrieved by the said order made by the Learned

High Court Judge, the Petitioner has filed this application for revision in this court.

Learned Counsel for both parties were heard in support of their respective positions. The

Learned Counsel for the Accused Petitioner states that the aforesaid order is illegal, wrongful

and contrary to law and lor unreasonable for anyone or more of the following reasons:-

1. The learned High Court Judge has failed to give due consideration to the ground that the

petitioner is in the incarceration for over 4 years up to now, and has no means of

bringing down the evidence to support the defense.

2. Learned Trial Judge failed to give due consideration to the fact that the petitioner is a

mother of a child who has no protection, which should have been considered as an

exceptional ground to grant bail.

3. The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the submissions made by (he

counsel made for the first accused and erred in evaluating the version of the suspect in

this matter including her family background and the pathetic situation faced by her

child. Therefore, further states that the impugned order of the learned High Court Judge

should allow to be sustained.

4. Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider that keeping a person in custody for an

uncertain period of time would infringe the fundamental rights of that person, and after

a trial if acquitted so violated fundamental rights of that person could not be

compensated by any means and there by the accused should have been released on

bail.

5. Learned High Court Judge failed to consider the fact that the accused should be given

the fullest opportunity to fight for her case allowing her to bring witnesses on her behalf

and when refusing bail even at the trial stage amounts to handicap the accused and

thereby she is denied a fair trial.

3

6. Learned High Court Judge even after concluding that the time period the petitioner

spent in the custody is quite excessive and then and then considering the amount of

heroin involved in the case is quite high, has decided tc? refuse bail which is erroneous

basis to refuse bail when there is exceptional ground has emerged and thereby causing

miscarriage of Justice.

7. Learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the fact that the petitioner has no

previous conviction or any pending cases against her, except for the present case which

should have been considered in favour of the petitioner.

8. Learned High Court Judge has failed to be mindful of the fact that the second accused

who faces charges as severe as the petitioner is on bail and he attends to court without

fail, clearly indicating that the punishment for the charges will not affect or will be

reason to jump from bailor none compliance with conditions of the bail order if any

event the court pleased to grant bail.

The Learned counsel for the Petitioner states that the matters set out in above mentioned

paragraphs constitute exceptioilal circumstances, which warrant exercising revisionar~'

jurisdiction of this court. Learned counsel for the Petitioner further states that the Petitioner

has previously invoked the jurisdiction of this court in respect of this matter in case no. CA

(PHC) APN 48/2014.

Considering the above submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner it is evident

that the above mentioned grounds does not constitute exceptional circumstances for the

purpose of releasing the petitioner on bail. The Learned High Court Judge has already taken into

consideration the above mentioned facts, specially the nature, gravity of offence and the

quantity of heroin alleged to have been in possession of the petitioner. The Learned High Court

Judge has amply demonstrated reasons for the said order and also mindful of the fact that the

gravity of the offence is sever and the sentence to be imposed will be the death penalty if

convicted.

In the bench mark decision in the case of Ramu Thamodarampillai Vs the AG (2004) 3 Sri L.R.

180 has dealt with the identical issue and had observed thus; lithe decision must be in each case depend on its own facts and circumstances. But, in order that like cases will be decided alike, there should be uniformity of decisions, it is necessary that guidance should be laid down for the

exercise of that discretion".

4

In the case of Mohamed Shiyam it was held that for an offence of committed under the above

act it is section 83 of the said act will be applicable and according to section 83, bail will be

granted only on exceptional circumstances.

Therefor considering the rationale observed by our superior courts, in granting bail to an

accused charged under the said act, it is abundantly clear, that Learned High Court Judge was

correct in refusing to enlarge the accused on Bail.

Hence, this court sees no reason to interfere with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge

and thereby the application for revision is hereby dismissed without costs.
