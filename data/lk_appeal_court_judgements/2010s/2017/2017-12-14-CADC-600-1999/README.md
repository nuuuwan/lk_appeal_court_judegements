The Plaintiff-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the "plaintiff") filed the above action in the

District Court of Avissawella seeking to partition the land known as Walauwewatte alias

Benewatte situated at Kaluaggala in the District of Colombo.

On 17th of August 1988 the plaintiff, 4th, 5th, 6th and 11th defendants were present and

represented by counsel. They informed court that parties had agreed on a settlement and sought

permission to lead evidence of it. The plaintiff gave evidence and during his evidence several

documents were marked and led in evidence at the close of the case of the plaintiff. The learned

District Judge of Avissawella on the same day delivered judgment. Interlocutory decree was

entered.

On or about 2nd September 1988 the 3rd and 9th defendants as well as the heirs of the 7th

defendant filed papers in the District Court to set aside the judgment dated 17th of August 1988.

On 11th October 1988 these applications were considered by the learned Additional District

Judge. The plaintiff and 11th defendant objected to these applications. The learned Additional

District Judge upheld the objections and stated that the applications are premature in view of

the provisions in section 48(4)(a) of the Partition Act and declined to make a final order on these

applications and stated that the parties can make the application again at the appropriate time.

On 17th February 1999, nearly 10 years after the first judgment and interlocutory decree was

entered, the matter came up before the then Additional District Judge of Avissawella. The record

indicates that the plaintiff, 4th,5th, 6th, 7A, 8th ,lOA, 11th, 12th ,13th and 14th defendants were

represented. It further indicates that the parties informed court that they agree to set aside the

judgment and decree entered previously and for trial to commence de novo. Accordingly, the

learned Additional District Judge commenced trial de novo. Plaintiff gave evidence and several

documents were marked in evidence. On 17th September 1999 the learned Additional District

Judge delivered judgment by which he held that the parties were entitled to the following shares

of the corpus:

Plaintiff

4th to 6th Defendants

The question is whether the learned Additional District Judge had the power to set aside the

judgment and interlocutory decree dated 17th of August 1988 entered by his predecessor.

The District Court is a statutory creation and its powers are essentially statutory. The District

Court has no jurisdiction conferred by law to re-hear, review, alter or vary its judgments in the

absence of express statutory provisions. Power to amend its own decree must be expressly

conferred on a subordinate Court as has been done in sections 84, 86, 87 and 707 of the Code. 1

For example, section 86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code gives power to the District Court to set

aside a judgment and decree granted after ex parte trial upon been satisfied that the defendant

had reasonable grounds for such default. Section 189(1) ofthe Civil Procedure Code grants power

to the District Court to correct any clerical or arithmetical mistake in any judgment or order or

any error arising therein from any accidental slip or omission, or may make any amendment

which is necessary to bring a decree into conformity with the judgment.

The reason is that once a judge delivers a judgment he is functus officio. In Ramasamy Pu/le v. De

Silva2 it was held that the District Court has no jurisdiction, except as provided by section 189 of

the Civil Procedure Code, to vacate or alter an order after it has been passed. In Dionis Appu v.

Arlis et af3 it was held that it is not competent to a Judge to reconsider or vary his judgment after

delivering it in open Court, except as provided by section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code. In

Paulusz v. Perera4 it was held that a District Court did not have the power to set aside the order

of dismissing a partition action upon a misconception regarding the documents filed in the case.

The Privy Council in Piyaratana Unnanse et al v. Wahareke Sonuttara Unnanse et als was called

upon to consider whether a District Judge had the power to amend a decree entered by his

predecessor on the basis of an alleged variance between the judgment of the court and the

decree based upon it. It was held that:

"The general rule is clear that once an Order is passed and entered or otherwise perfected

in accordance with the practice of the court, the court which passed the Order is functus

officio and cannot set aside or alter the Order however wrong it may appear to be. That

can only be done on appeal. Section 189 of the Civil Procedure Code of Ceylon, which

embodies the provisions of Order XXVIII, Rule 11 of the English Rules of the Supreme

Court and the inherent jurisdiction vested in every court to ensure that its order carries

into effect the decision at which it arrived, provides an exception to the general rule, but

it is an exception within a narrow compass."6

A divisional bench of the present Supreme Court has restated the same principle. Amerasinghe

J. in Jeyaraj Fernandopul/e v. Premachandra De Silva and Others7 explained the principle and the

rationale for it as follows:

"An order which has not attained finality according to the law or practice obtaining in a

Court can be revoked or recalled by the Judge or Judges who made the order, acting with

discretion, exercised judicially and not capriciously. (See Moosajees Ltd. v. P.O. Fernando

and Others.(8)) However, as a general rule, no court has power to rehear, review, alter

or vary any judgment or order made by it after it has been entered (cf. Marambe

Kumarihamy v. Perera,(16)) either in an application made in the original action or matter

or in a fresh action brought to review the judgment or order. If it is suggested that a

Court has come to an erroneous decision either in regard to fact or law, then

amendment of the judgement or order cannot be sought, but recourse must be had to

an appeal to the extent to which the appeal is available. (See per Morris, U in Thynne

(Marchioness of Bath) v. Thynne (Marquess of Bath).(17) A Court has no power to amend

or set aside its judgment or order where it has come to light or if it transpires that the

judgment or order has been obtained by fraud or false evidence. In such cases relief must

be sought by way of appeal or where appropriate, by separate action, to set aside the

judgment or order. (Halsbury, paragraph 556). The object of the rule is to bring litigation

to finality.JlB (emphasis added)

Section 48(1) of the Partition Act states that, subject to any appeal which may be preferred

therefrom or subject to subsections (4) and (5) therein, an interlocutory decree entered under

section 26 shall be "final and conclusive" for all purposes against all persons. In my view the

phrase "final and conclusive" therein signifies that once interlocutory decree has been entered it

cannot be changed by the District Court except in the situations coming within subsections (4)

and (5) therein. This "final and conclusive" effect is given to an interlocutory decree

notwithstanding any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof of title adduced before the

court.

That been the general principle, the question is whether the learned Additional District Judge

had inherent power to set aside the earlier judgment and interlocutory dated 17th of August

1988. Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code states that nothing in therein shall be deemed to

limit or otherwise affect the inherent power of the court to make such orders as may be

necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of the process of the court. There are two

reasons why inherent powers cannot apply in this case. There is no inherent power in a Court of

subordinate jurisdiction to set aside its own decree even though it be wrong.9 Inherent powers

of the District Court cannot apply where there are specific statutory provisions. 10

Sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 48 of the Partition Act are such provisions. Any challenge

before the District Court to the interlocutory decree dated 17th of August 1988 should have been

within the ambit of these sub-sections. The learned Additional District Judge of Avissawella did

not act under either of the above sub-sections. In fact, he overlooked the earlier order made by

his predecessor on 11th October 1988 on the application made by the 3rd and 9th defendants as

well as the heirs of the 7th defendants to set aside the judgment dated 17th of August 1988. He

would not have fallen into error if he had considered it.

For the reasons set out above, I am of the opinion that the learned Additional District Judge did

not have the power to set aside the earlier judgment and interlocutory decree dated 17th of

August 1988.

It was argued that trial de novo was conducted with the consent of all the parties and therefore

the District Court had jurisdiction. The record does not indicate that the 3rd defendant was

present or represented on 17th February 1999 when the learned Additional District Judge decided

to commence trial de novo on the application of the parties. The 14th defendant-respondent

argues that the registered attorney-at-law for the 3rd defendant, Mr. Piyasena Ranasinghe was

present in Court and that in view of the judgment in Andiappa Chettiar v. Sanmugam Chettiarll

that constitutes an appearance on behalf of the 3rd defendant. Accordingly, it is submitted that

the 3rd defendant had consented to the procedure that was followed and he cannot now

complain. I do not agree. The facts of this case differ from that in Andiappa Chettiar v. Sanmugam

Chettiar. 12 There the proctor appeared when the case was called and informed court that he had

"no instructions" and "no material on which to proceed with the case". That is not so in this case.

Although Mr. Piyasena Ranasinghe was present in court on 17th February 1999, he had marked

his appearance only for the 4th, 5th, 6th 7A, lOA, 12th, 13th and 14th defendants. According to the

record he did not mark his appearance for the 3rd defendant. Neither did he inform court that he

had no instructions or no material to proceed with the case for the 3rd defendant.

In any event, I am of the view that consent of the parties cannot bestow jurisdiction upon the

District Court to act outside the specific procedures laid down in Section 48 of the Partition Act

as the interlocutory decree entered in terms of section 26 of the Partition Act is, subject to the

limitations specified in Section 48 therein, given final and conclusive effect against the whole

world. It is not open to a person to confer jurisdiction by consent and no amount of acquiescence

would confer jurisdiction upon a tribunal or Court where such jurisdiction did not exist.13 There

are other reasons as well. It is an established principle that parties cannot, by consent or

otherwise, vary the judgments or orders of any other Court.14 It is the duty of the Court to

examine and investigate title in a partition action, because the judgement is a judgement in

rem. 1S

~~~ For the foregoing reasons, I allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of the learned Eistrict

Judge of Avissawella dated 17th September 1999. I make no order as to costs.

The learned District Judge of Avissawella is directed to expeditiously conclude the matter by

taking further steps according to law.
