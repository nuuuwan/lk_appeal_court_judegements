Deepali Wijesundera, J.

Accused Appellant was indicted under Section 296 of the Penal

Code for the murder of one Nihal Edirisinghe and after trial he

was convicted for culpable homicide not amounting to murder

under Section 297 of the Penal Code. He was sentenced to 10

years Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 50,000/-was

imposed with a default term of one year. Counsel for the

Accused Appellant informs court that he is not canvassing the

conviction and only canvassing the sentence.

We heard both counsel in support of their applications. The

learned DSG has no objections to the sentence being varied.

Considering the evidence and the submissions made, we decide to

reduce the sentence to 8 years Rigorous Imprisonment. The other
