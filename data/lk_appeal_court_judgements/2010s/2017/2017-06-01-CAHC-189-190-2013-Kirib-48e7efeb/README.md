of one Chamila Samarasinghe, punishable under Section 296

of the Penal Code.

The trial court, on a scrutiny of evidence adduced, held

the Appellants herein, to be guilty of the charge levelled

against them and sentenced them as herein before mentioned.

The genesis and the origin of the prosecution case reveals

thus;

That on this fateful day at about 8.30 p.m. the alleged

intrudes came to the house of the deceased, while the

mother of the deceased was watching the Accused-

Appellants, when one of the Accused - Appellant opened fire

of a gun wherein the deceased was killed. The only

witness to the said incident was the mother of

deceased, who watched the dreadful incident at a distance

of 10 to 11 feet from the place where the deceased meet

his doom.

eye

the

It transpired from the testimony of the mother of the

deceased that she was able to identify the Accused-

Appellants from their features VIZ. from the forehead and

the nose although the face was covered with a black

cloth. It was categorically stated by the above witness that

further she observed that the 3rd Accused - Appellant was

a short and dark In complexion and 4th Accused - Appellant

was tall and fair In complexion. It is salient to note that

the said witness had identified these Accused - Appellants

in the identification parade as well as in the dock.

It is contended by the counsel for the Accused - Appellants

that the said witness did identify the Accused - Appellants

1n the identification parade as they were shown to the

witness by the police when the Accused - Appellants were

arrested and was 1n remand. But said position was

vehemently denied by the witness. Further it 1S salient to

note that this position was taken up by the Accused-

Appellants only in the statement made 1n the dock. The

above position was never suggested to the witness in the

course of the cross examination. Besides it is pertinent to

note that the statement made in an identification parade

is not substantive evidence and the determination of the

culpability of the Accused will only depend on the evidence

transpired 1n court. It was so held in the case of KIRTHEE

BANDARA .VS. AG (2000) 2 SRI L.R. 247. Hence this court

has taken serious note of the fact that the above witness

identified the Accused- Appellants from the features and the

said identification was not effected in difficult circumstances

and conditions.

It emanates from the deposition of the above witness that

she witnessed the alleged incident from the light that was

burning and observing the Accused - Appellants nearly for

3 minutes. Therefore 1n the above circumstance there cannot

be a mistake as to the identity of the Accused - Appellants.

The principle ground of appeal of the Accused - Appellants

was that the above witness had identified them at a

fleeting glance which is unsafe for the court to act 1n

4

the event of a conviction. Therefore the conviction and

sentence of this case IS challenged on the ground of the

identification at a fleeting glance which is highly improbable

1n this given situation.

As per contra the counsel for the Respondent, has urged

In confutation that considering the plinth of the case of

REGINA .VS. TURNBULL (1976) 3 ALL E.R. 549, wherein an

identification of Turnbull was effective by a single detective

constable who was in a movIng car had identified Turnbull

when he turned his head who was also in a moving car.

Nevertheless the court held that they could rely on this

glimpse, which was a fleeting glance.

Therefore it was the categorical position of the counsel

Respondent that at the time of the incident there was

sufficient light which was confirmed by the officer who

visited scene of crime, and thus the Accused - Appellants

were identified although their faces were covered expos1ng

the eyes and the forehead, which was sufficient for the

witness to identify the Accused - Appellants. In the said back

drop the Accused - Appellants were not identified at a fleeting

glance, but it was a clear identification of the culprit or

the perpetrator. Hence the argument put forth by the counsel

for the Accused - Appellants 1S not tenable and stands

rejected.

The counsel for the Accused - Appellants also rruses the

issue of probability. It was the position of the counsel for

the Accused - Appellants that it is not possible to identify

the culprits who were with half covered faces, and to

identify with the remaining uncovered parts of the face.

It is intensely relevant to note that in the instant matter

the witness had specifically stated that how she identified

the Accused - Appellants, which is probable as per observation

of the Trial judge. Hence it is seen that the testimony of

the sole eye witness is definitely beyond reproach.

For the foregoing reasons, we see no merit in this appeal

and therefore we proceed to dismiss the appeal and we

affirm the finding, conviction and the sentence imposed on

the Accused - Appellants.

Accordingly appeal is dismissed.
