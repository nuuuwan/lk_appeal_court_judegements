petition and affidavit issued a stay order in terms of paragraph "e" of the

prayer to the petition. On notice been served the Respondent appearing in

court filed their objections to issue ofthe stay order. Thereafter on 4/1112014

1 st to 9th Petitioners filed their application for substitution in room of the

deceased Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner Mutthaia Shanmugam. After

objections been filed inquiry regarding the substitution was held on

15/03/2016. This court after inquiry made its order on 15/03/2016

appointing pt, 3rd, 4th, 5th and Jth Respondents as l(a) to l(e) substituted-

Petitioner-Petitioner.

On 03/03/2014 both parties agreed to abide by the decision given in this

case in respect CA (PRC) No. 68/11.

The Petitioner states that the Applicant-Respondent-Respondent instituted

proceedings against the Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner (herein after

referred to as the Petitioner) under and in terms of section 5 of the State

lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 (as amended) by

application dated 15th July 2010, seeking as substantive relief an order

ejecting the Petitioner and his dependents from the premises more fully

described in the schedule to the said application. The Respondent pleaded

inter alia in the aforesaid application that;

a) The Respondent is the relevant Competent Authority;

b) The land pertinent described in the schedule to the application was

in her opinion State Land;

c) A notice to Quit( attached to the application)was served on the

Petitioner;

d) The Petitioner has failed to act in terms of section 4(b) ofthe State

Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

The Petitioner thereafter duly tendered his objections/ show cause in

writing, on or about 2nd September 2010, and pleaded inter alia that;

(a) The Respondent's predecessor instituted proceedings against the

Petitioner before the Magistrate's Court ofNuwara Eliya in case

No. 86537 seeking the same relief sought by way of the

application filed in the present matter.

(b) The said application was dismissed by the Magistrate's Court, by

order dated 12th June 2008.

(c) Hence, the said order operated as Res Judicata in this instance and

the Respondent was prevented and restrained in law from

instituting fresh proceedings against the Petitioner concerning the

identical subject matter.

(d) The land concerned was vested with Agarapatana Plantations Ltd

and therefore the Respondent was prevented and restrained in law

\1

tI \

from seeking to act in terms of the state Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No 7 of 1979.

(e) The notice to quit and I or the Affidavit were not in conformity

with the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No 7 of 1979.

The Learned Magistrate thereafter directed the parties to tender their

respective written submissions which were duly tendered to court and the

Learned Magistrate thereafter pronounced his order dated 7th October 2010,

granting the relief sought for by the Respondent.

Being aggrieved by the said order ofthe Learned Magistrate, the Petitioner

preferred an application for revision to the High Court of Nuwara Eliya in

case No HCINEI 39/IO/RE by petition dated 25th November 2010 seeking

that the order of the Learned Magistrate dated Jth October 2010 be revised

as substantive relief. The Respondent thereafter tendered statement of

objections dated 5th May 2011 and thereafter parties tendered their written

submissions as directed by the High Court Judge.

The Petitioner in his written submissions submitted inter alia paragraph 7 of

the petition is as follows;

a) The Land concerned has been vested with Agarapatana Plantations

Ltd, which is a private entity;

b) The Respondent cannot make avail of the State Lands (Recovery

of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979 in law, when the land concerned

is vested and lor leased to a private entity.

c) Hence, the Respondent has no power or authority to seek an order

to evict the Petitioner, having regard to the following authorities;

(i) Judgment of the Court of Appeal, dated 30th May

2002 (as affirmed by the Supreme Court in

SC/SPL/LAlI48/2002) m Adakan Periayah

Muthiah V. S.C.K.de Alwis, Consultant!

Plantation expert, Plantation Reform Project,

Ministry of Plantations (CA Application No.

(ii) Judgment of the Court of Appeal, dated 5th April

2007, in Sunil Chandrakumar Vs. K.S. Velu

(CA(PHC) APN No. 176/1997.

Attention court has been drawn to the judgment in the case of Adakan

Periayah Muthiah Vs. S.C.K. de Alwis, Consultant! Plantation Expert,

Plantation Reform Project, Minister of Plantations (CA application No

1560/2000)

Page 5 of the Judgment

" The Respondent in his affidavit has stated that the ownership of

Stonycliff Estate remains with the JEDB which is an

incorporation established in terms of the State Agricultural

Corporation Act (paragraph 12( e). This is assertion is correct but

on the basis of the JEDB's bare ownership can it exercise control

I( I i t. i f

\

J

over the quarters occupied by the petitioner. In my opinion JEDB

cannot seek to exercise its right as a lesser unless the use of the

quarters is contrary to the lease agreement between the JEDB and

the Kotagala Plantation. There is no allegation that Kotagala

Plantation has done anything in respect of the quarters contrary to

the lease agreement. The Petitioner is simply an overstaying

tenant under a public company. Then it is for the company to take

steps under the law to have him evicted. A third party which has

no nexus with the petitioner cannot direct the Petitioner to vacate

the premises. Here it appears that the company is attempting to

use a shortcut without getting involved in civil litigation to evict

Page 8 of the Judgment

"by virtue of indenture of lease possession and control of the

assets of the Stony cliff Group were vested in the Kotagala

Plantations Company. Can the Respondents, claiming to be the

agents of JEDB which has bare dominium without possession and

power of control over the immovable property of Stony cliff

Group, place an outsider in possession of the quarters occupied

by the petitioner? The answer is obviously in the negative. Then

it is necessarily follows that he cannot also interfere with the

possession of a person who occupied the quarters as an employee

of the lessee although such person is overstaying without any

justification. Accordingly that the Petitioner is entitled to the

relief he has prayed for in the petition ... "

10

The Supreme Court thereafter, upon an application made to challenge the

said judgment of the Court of Appeal, refused to grant leave and dismissed

the Application.

Attention court has been drawn to the judgment in the case of Sunil

Chandrakumar Vs. K.S. Velu (CA(PHC) No 176/1997 and specifically to

the following pages;

Page 2 of the Judgment

" This is an appeal against the order of the Learned High Court

Judge of Kandy dated 5.11.1997 wherein he issued a writ of

certiorari quashing the quit notice issued by the competent

authority of the Ministry of Plantation. The main thrust of the

Petitioner's case, in the appeal is that the Learned High Court

Judge erred when he held that the Competent Authority had no

power to issue a quit notice, on the basis that the Competent

Authority could not invoke the jurisdiction under the

Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act No 7 of

1969 as amended by Acts No.3 of 1971, No. 40 of 1974 and

No.8 of 1981. As at the relevant time, the property was

managed by a Private Company namely, Mathurata

Plantations Ltd the Respondents argument was that although

the property was given on an indenture of lease Mathurata

Plantations Ltd. The ownership remained with the government

and therefore the government had ut dominus over the

property and everything on it and was entitled to issue the quit

notice."

11

Page 3 of the Judgment

"As against the argument, the Learned Counsel for the

Respondnet refered to Adakan Periyah Muthiah Vs. S.C.K. de

Alwis, CA Application No 1560/2000 minutes dated

30.05.2002 and also CA 2166/2003 decided on 12.05.2005

R.M. Kusuma Ranasinghe V s. Abeyananda Dias, Competent

Authority, Plantation Management Division, Ministry of

Plantation Industry."

In the case of2005 R.M. Kusuma Ranasinghe Vs. Abeyananda Dias (supra)

the judgment delivered by H.L.Justice Sri Skandarajah at page 9 of the

judgment is read as follows,

" It cannot seek the assistance of the lesser (JEDB) to take

under special law such as the State Land (Recovery of

Possession) Act which was enacted to serve a specific purpose

such as ejecting unauthorized occupiers of State and to recover

possession of that law to the State."

Page 4 of the Judgment

" Whilst subscribing fully to the reasons expressed by Hon.

Justice Sri Skandarajah he go a step further and state that one

cannot allow or permit a private concern to achieve something

indirectly what can be achieved directed under the

Government Quarters (Recovery of Possession) Act."

" In a matter of this nature we are not concerned so much about

the ownership of the particular land. We are only concerned

with the intention of the legislature and the letter and spirit of

the law and the purpose for which the law was enacted."

~ I

\

r

12

" with the execution of the lease the whole business of the

plantations reform project was vested with the Mathurata

Plantations Ltd and the whole business came under the

management of Mathurata Plantations Ltd. Thus what was

hitherto government quarters became private quarters for the

benefit and at the disposal of the Mathurata Plantations Ltd.

Occupied by the employees of the said concern in the course

and within the scope of the employment, the government

losing its control over the said premises, although the

ownership of the said premises remained with the

government?"

Page 5 of the Judgment

" Having considered the submissions made by the counsel and

after perusing the documents, and the case law referred to we

are of the view that the Government Quarters (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.7 of 1969 cannot and should not be

allowed to be made use of by private concerns to achieve their

own ends which I this is completely against the letter and spirit

of the particular law, which is meant to protect the interests

and to ensure the smooth running of the business and other

ventures of government concerns and public corporations."

Thereafter the Learned High Court Judge ofNuwara Eliya pronounced his

judgment dated 6th July 2011 by affirming the order of the Learned

Magistrate dated 7th October 2010 and dismiss the Petitioner's application.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment of the High Court the Petitioner

13

preferred this application in Revision against the judgment pronounced on

6th July 2011 by the High Court Judge ofNuwara Eliya in revision, upon the

following exceptional grounds. The exceptional grounds has been pleaded

in paragraph 9 (a) to (e) of the petition of the said revision application as

follows;

(a) The said judgment of the High Court, dated 6th July 2011 and/or the

said order of the Learned Magistrate, dated Jth October 2010 is/ are

contrary to law and/or is/are per incuriam and/or is/are a grave

mistake of fact and/or law;

(b) The High Court and/or the Learned Magistrate have misdirected

themselves, by failing to appreciate and/or determine that Respondent

was prevented and/or restrained in law from seeking to act and/or take

steps in terms of the State Lands(Recovery of Possession) Act No 7

of 1979, having particular regard to the fact that the land concerned

has admittedly been vested and/or leased to Agarapatana Plantations

Ltd and that Agarapatana Plantations Ltd being a private entity,

cannot seek to achieve a purpose indirectly which it cannot achieve

directly in law;

(c) The High Court and/or the Learned Magistrate has/have erred in law

by failing to appreciate and/or determine and/or apply in the correct

perspective the following authorities, rendering the impugned

14

judgment and/or order contrary to the principles enumerated in the

said authorities;

(i) Judgment of the Court of Appeal, dated 30th May 2002

(as affirmed by the Supreme Court m

SC/SPLILAlI48/2002) in Adakan Periayah Muthiah V.

S.C.K. de Alwis, Consultant! Plantation Expert,

Plantation Reform project, Ministry of Plantations (CA

Application No 1560/2000);

(ii) Judgment of the Court of Appeal dated 5th April 2007 in

Sunil Chandrakumar Vs. K.S. Velu (CA(PHC)APN No

176/1997).

(d) The High Court and/ or the Learned Magistrate hasl have misdirected

in fact and/ or law by failing to appreciate and/ or determine, that the

application of the Respondent did not conform to the mandatory

provisions of the State Lands ( Recovery of Possession) Act, in as

much as that, there is a violation of the format and form and

procedural requirements stipulated therein;

(e) The High Court and/ or the Learned Magistrate hasl have therefore

failed to appreciate and/or determine and/or apply in the correct

perspective the case of Kandiah V. Abeykoon (CA594/86)

Reported at Sriskantha's Law Reports Vol IV part II pages 103-

113, having particular regard to the fact that the said anomalies and/or

discrepancies contained in the application and/or notice to quit of the

Respondent, did not conform to the statutorily prescribed forms in

terms of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979

and therefore that the Learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to accept

15

the purported application of the Respondent and/or issue summons

thereupon;

It was contended that the High Court Judge has misdirected himself in law

by failing to appreciate and/ or determine that the aforementioned groundsl

reasons constituted exceptional circumstances for the granting of the

substantive relief as prayed for in the petition of the Petitioner. The

substantive relief prayed for by the petitioner is as follows,

(a) Revise and set aside the judgment of the High Court ofNuwara

Eliya dated 6th July 2011 in case No HCINE/39/10lREV ;

(b)Revise and set aside the order of the Magistrate's Court of

Nuwara Eliya dated 7th October 2010 in case no MCINE/4093/10.

The petitioner submitted that he has been in uninterrupted and independent

possession of the said land concerned for a period exceeding Thirty Seven

years and the Petitioner has constructed a residential premises, made

substantial developments thereupon and is residing therein with his wife,

son, daughter and his grandchildren. It was submitted that unless the

following interim orders are granted and issued by courts until the final

determination of this application grave and irreparable loss, damage and

prejudice will be fall andl or be caused to the Petitioner unjustifiably, and

this application will be rendered nugatory.

(a) An interim order restraining the operation of the judgment

of the High Court of Nuwara Eliya dated 6th July 2011 in

case No HCINE/39/10/Rev, until the final determination of

this application; and! or

(b) An interim order restraining the operation of the order of

the Magistrate Court of Nuwara Eliya dated 'fh October

2010 in case No MCINE/4093110, until the final

determination of this application.

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent file in his statement of objections

admitted the averments contained in paragraph 1 and 2 of the petition, and

states that she is the duly appointed competent authority under section 18 of

the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No. 7 of 1979. She also stated

that;

(a) The land concurred is part of New Portmore Estate owned by the

state, and it has been leased to Agarapatana Plantations Ltd. By the

Janatha Estate Development Board. (Lease agreement bearing No

324 dated 1'fh March 1994 attested by C.J. Fernando Notary Public

(marked as "R2") has been pleaded as part and parcel of the

statement of objections True copies ofthe Gazette extraordinary No

183/10 dated 12th March 1982 and the Gazette extraordinary dated

22/06/1992 marked as "R3" and "R4" respectively and are pleaded

as part and parcel of the statement of objections.

(b) That the Petitioner was in unauthorized possession of the said land

and therefore an application was made under the provisions of the

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No 7 of 1979 (as

f ilI !I

I! 1I

17

amended) to the Magistrate's Court of Nuwara Eliya to evict the

Petitioner and those holding under him.

The Respondent admits that the Petitioner tendered his show cause in the

said Magistrate's Court action and took up several objections to the

Respondent's application and states that the said objections are without

merit. The Respondents admits the averments in paragraph 4 of the Petition.

The Respondent responding to averments in paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 of the

petition, the Respondent admitted that an application for revision bearing

No HCINE/39/101RE was made by the Petitioner to the High Court of

Nuwara Eliya seeking to set aside the Magistrate's Court's order and the

Respondent filed her statement of objections and both parties tendered their

written submissions. After considering the material before court and the

written submissions of both parties the High Court Judge delivered his

judgment affirming the order of the Magistrate's Court.

The Respondent denies the averments contained in paragraphs 9,10,11,12

and 13 of the petition. The Respondent further states that;

(a) The land concurred remains the property of the state;

(b) The leasing of the property has not deprived the state of its

ownership;

18

(c) Agarapatana Plantations Ltd is not a private entity as stated by the

Petitioner, but the state owns a sizable percentage of shares and

also a Golden share with certain special rights;

( True copies of the articles of Association of the said company

the statement offering for sale 51 % of shares of the company by

the state as marked "R5" and "R6" respectively and are pleaded

as part and parcel ofthis statements of objections) and;

( d) The authorities cited by the Petitioner are not applicable to this

matter before this court.

It was submitted that the Petitioner has failed to comply with the

mandatory provisions of Act No 19 of 1990 in that the Petitioner has failed

exercise the right of appeal in terms thereof, and in any event the petition

has been filed after lapse of time provided in the Act. Further the Petitioner

has not disclosed any valid grounds or exceptional circumstances for

invoking the revisionary powers. The Petitioner's application to be rejected

and the Respondent states that the Petitioner is not entitled to the relief

prayed.

When considering the submissions of the Petitioner and the Respondent

we find that the main issue between the parties is that whether the land in

dispute is State Land or Private Property. The Appellant has failed to

19

produce any valid permit for the possession of the land and has failed to

produce any other valid authority under the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act section 9 it is stated that,

" as such inquiry the person on whom summons under

section 5 has been served shall not be entitled to contest any of

the matters stated in the application under section 5 except that

such person may establish that he is in possession or

occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the state granted in accordance with any written

law and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid"

In the case ofMohandiram Vs. Chairman Janatha Estate Development

Board 1992 1 SLR pg 110 his Lordship Grero J, held that;

"in an inquiry under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act,

the onus is on the person summoned to establish his possession or

occupation that it is possessed or occupied upon a valid permit or

other written authority of the state granted according to any written

law. If his burden is not discharged the only option open to the

Magistrate is to order ejectment. "

I 1

The new Portmore Estate was vested in the Land Reform Commission

and then vested with the Janatha Estate Development Board established

under the State Agricultural Corporations Act vide document marked "R3".

As per Gazette "R4" Agarapathana Plantations Ltd was incorporated under

conversion of public corporations or Government owned business under

taking to public companies Act No. 23 of 1987 to take over the functions

and carry on the business of the parts of the Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation and Janatha Estates Development Board. The Gazette marked

"R4" further shows that new Portmore Estate, Agarapatana is owned and

managed by Janatha Estates Development Board. By indenture of lease No.

324 marked as "R2" the new Portmore Estate was leased to Agarapatana

Plantations Ltd by Janatha Estates Development Board. The aforesaid lease

is for 99 years with a termination clause thus clearly indicating that the estate

had not been vested with Agarapatana Plantations Ltd. Accordingly we hold

that the land in dispute had not been vested with the Agarapatana Plantations

Ltd, but its owned by the state.

Accordingly in terms of section 18 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No 58 of 1981 will apply in respect ofthe land and premises

of land in dispute.

1f t

21

" 'state land' means land to which the state is lawfully entitled or

which may be disposed of by the state together with any building

standing thereon, and with all rights, interests and privileges attached

or appertaining thereto, and includes - (a) ...... ; (b) land vested in or

owned by, or under the control of- (i) the Land Reform Commission

established by the land Reform; (ii) any corporate body established

by or under the Rubber Research, the Sri Lanka State Plantations

Corporation Act, the State Agricultural Corporations Act, ...... "

Accordingly, we hold that the Learned Magistrate was correct in issuing

the order of the ejectment when the Appellant failed to produce a permit

under section 9 of the Act and the decision of the Provincial High Court was

correct by refusing to exercise revisionary jurisdiction to revise the order of

the Learned Magistrate. The contention of the 1 st to 9th Substituted

Petitioners was that the land in question was vested with Agarapatana

Plantation Ltd and therefore the Respondent was prevented and restrained

in law from seeking to Act in terms of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act No.7 of 1979. We are of the view that it is not so and the

said land is not a private entity in terms of the law. Hence we reject the

argument of the Substituted-Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner that the

Respondent has no power or authority to seek an order to evict the original

appellant having regard to the following authorities.

In the case of Goonathilaka and Another Vs. Thollappan (2007) 2 SLR

page 394, wherein it was held by S.N. Silva CJ that;

"Bogawantalawa Plantations Ltd was an estate vested in the

Land Reform Commission and later in the Sri Lanka State

Plantations Corporation (SLPC). The Respondent was an employee

of the SLPC and was permitted to occupy the land in question on the

payment of a sum of Rs. 50/- per month as rent. Subsequently the

estates vested in the SLPC was leased out to companies established

in terms of the Conversion of Public Corporations or Government

Owned Business undertakings into Public Companies Act.

Bogawantalawa Plantations Ltd was incorporated in terms of the

said Act, the estate within which the land occupied by the

respondent is situated was leased by SLPC to Bogawantalawa

Plantations Ltd.

The Court of Appeal issued a writ of certiorari on the basis that

the respondent had been given on rent a building and that the land

is mere appurtenant to the building. The notice to quit was issued

by the original Respondent-Appellant as the Competent Authority

for the purpose of the State Land (Recovery of Possession) Act on

the basis that the respondent (V.N. Thollappan) is in unauthorized

occupation of state land. The land described in the schedule to the

notice to quit is a portion offield 4 of the Bogawantalawa Estate.

..

23

Bogawantalawa Plantations Ltd was thus incorporated by an

order dated 22.6.1992 made in terms of the said Act. The

Bogawantalawa estate within which the land occupied by the

petitioner is admittedly situated was leased by the SLPC to

Bogawantalawa Plantations Ltd, by Lease bearing No 83 dated

18.01.1994 attested byJ. Kottage, Notary Public.

The lease is for a period of99 years and contains a provision

for prior termination. Therefore the land remains vested in the Sri

Lanka State Plantations Corporation. "

In the case of Muttuvelu Vs. Dias and Another (2004)2 SLR 335 it was

held that;

Per Wijerathne J,

" A lease though considered a Pro tanto transfer, is a

contract between the Lessor and the Lessee, governed by the terms

of the indenture of Lease . Lessee during the tenure of the lessee may

exercise all the rights of the owner with regard to the possession

and enjoyment of the property leased as against third parties. A

lessor by reason of the lease does not lose his right of ownership

and may exercise his rights of ownership especially towards more

24

fully assuring the control and possession of the devised property to

the lessee. "

Provisions of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

reveal that it is a special enactment providing for the speedy

recovery of State Lands from unlawful occupiers. The State

continued to be the owner of the estates leased. "

Accordingly we hold that the said land in question remains the property of

state whiles and the said leasing of the land has not deprived the state of its

ut dominus upon the land concerned been leased to the Agarapatana

Plantations Ltd.

Accordingly we hold that the Appellant has failed to provide any permit

or authority under section 9 of the State Lands Recovery of Possession Act.

It was contention of the substituted-Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner that

the state has no rights or entitlement in law to issue any notice to quit to

obtain possession of the land. It was contended that upon reading clause 4(e)

of the said indenture of lease that it is clear that it is Agarapatana Plantations

Ltd which has the power to take steps in terms of the Civil Law to see that

the Original Petitioner and his Dependents be evicted from the premises

concerned, and not the Respondent to this application. However, on a

perusal of the Indenture of lease been "R2" the lessee Agarapatana

Plantations Ltd of the said document in paragraph 4{ e) we find that it's read

as follows,

4 (e) '7he Lessee shall also be entitled to grant tenancies

and licenses, accept tenancies and surrenders of them,

collect rents and other payments, enforce tenancy and

license terms, take defend and compromise legal

actions, comply with the statutory obligations in

relation thereto."

We find that by the said Lease agreement the power to institute legal action

against 3rd parties has been given to the Agarapatana Plantations Ltd.

In the present case the original Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner has not

produced any lease agreement or Tenancy agreement with Agarapatana

Plantations Ltd. The original Respondent -Petitioner-Petitioner has taken up

the position that he has been in uninterrupted and independent possession of

the said land concerned for a period exceeding Thirty seven years and that

he has constructed a residential premises made substantial development

there in and is residing with his wife, son and daughter and grandchildren.

No material has been placed to prove this facts. As such it is evident that the

original Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner IS a Trespassers in this land.

Hence the substituted-Respondents too has not produced any lease

agreement or a contract of tenancy with Agarapatana Plantations Ltd or

tendered proof to show that she is an independent possession of the land

concerned or a permit holder from the state.

We find that, all of the case law and authorities cited by the

Substituted-Respondents-Petitioners-Petitioners are irrelevant to this

Revision application. The only matter to be considered in this application

for revision is whether the Learned Magistrate was correct in issuing the

order for ejectment when the Petitioner failed to produce a permit under

section 9 of the Act and whether the decision of the Provincial High Court

was correct by refusing to exercise revisionary jurisdiction to revise the

order of the Learned Magistrate.

In the circumstance, in view of the matters highlighted above that the

Substituted-Respondents-Petitioners-Petitioners have failed to forward any

permit or authority under section 9 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act. Accordingly we see no reason to interfere with the

judgment of the Learned High Court Judge and the order of the Learned

Magistrate.

State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

showing cause is entitled to the possession or occupation of

the land he shall make order directing such person and his

dependents, if any, in occupation of such land to be ejected

forthwith from such land.

(2) No appeal shall lie against any order of ejectment made by a

Magistrate under subsection (1)

As such we affirm the judgment of the High Court of Nuwara Eliya dated

6th July 2011 in case No HCINE/39/10/Rev and the Order of the Learned

Magistrate of Nuwara Eliya dated 7th October 2010 in case No MCINEI

4093/10 and dismiss this Revision Application of the Substituted-

Respondent-Petitioner-Petitioner with costs ofRs.50,000/-.

As the parties had agreed to be bound by this order it is applicable and shall

be binding on the parties in respect of case No. CA (PHC) 68/2011.
