The Petitioner submits that he joined the I st Respondent RDA in 1996

and presently employed as a Senior Engineer in the construction division

and attached as Resident Engineer at Kurunegala.

There was an administration circular calling for application for the

Position of Chief Engineer (Kurunegala). Applications were invited from

the Engineers in Road Development Authority with the qualification of

Chief/ Senior Engineer who are in grade 2-1 or grade 1 in the R.D.A.

The said circular No. R.D.A. / A/5 DDA/IR/GGN was dated 02.07.2015

and signed by the Director General of RDA, who is the 3rd Respondent.

The said circular is marked as PIO and submitted with the petition.

The Petitioner claims that he was qualified to apply for the post, and he

submitted his application on the 14th July 2015.

The 3rd Respondent by issuing an administration circular No.

2015/CL/37(I) dated 16.07.2015, cancelled the prevIOUS calling for

~ application for the post of Chief Engineer, Kurunegala. The said

The Petitioner submits that on the date of cancellation the 18th

Respondent was transferred to Kurunegala on a annual transfer.

For the purposes of completeness, I consider the submissions made by

the Petitioner, when the position of Chief Engineer, Gampaha fell vacant

on the 16.07.2015 it was also advertised in a similar way, six suitable

candidates, including the petitioner applied for the said position.

According to R 1 submitted by the Respondent. The petitioner was

placed on the 3 rd position. The Petitioner has no complaint against

that process and accept the decision made by the interview panel.

The complaint of the Petitioner is that there is no transparency in the

appointment of the position of the Chief Engineer, Kurunegala.

According to the annual transfer scheme which was in operation from

the 01.01.2015 by circular No. 2014/CL/45 and reference No.

RDA/A/02/AO/annuai dated 20.08.2014 signed by the Director General

of RDA. The scheme of transfer IS very well settled In the said

circular.

The Petitioner submits that the incumbent of the Kurunegala Station

the 18th Respondent was stationed at another popular station I.e.

Gampaha. According to the circular he should work at the station for

more than five years. The 18th Respondent in this case had worked

less than five years.

Respondents virtually admits the procedure PI 0, P 12 namely calling for

application and cancellation and submits that the transfer was due to

exi2ency of service other than this explanation the Respondent had

not submitted, why they did not follow administrative circular

regarding the annual transfer. It is also noted that the 18th Respondent

was transferred from a popular station to another popular station namely

Gampaha to Kurunegala.

The Respondents had failed to provide any reasonable explanation for

deviating from the standared procedures to fill the vacaI'\t position at

Kurunegala.

It is also pointed out by the Petitioner that the 18th Respondent who

had been named, did not submit any explanation or warranted

circumstances for him to be appointed as a Chief Engineer to

Kurunegala.

The Respondents mainly takes up the defence of laches the Petitioner.

Now I deal with the said objections taken up by the 1 s" 2nd, 4th and

5th Respondents. It is submitted that the administrative circular marked

PI0, was dated on 02.07.2015 and the said circular was cancelled on

16.07.2015 and it is marked as P12. The petition was filed on the

14.09.2015 therefore the Petitioner is guilty of laches. I peruse

materials before us and find that the Petitioner had submitted his

application for post of Chief Engineer, Kurunegala on 14.07.2015.

After the said cancellation circular P12 was issued the Petitioner

raised his concern with the Project Directors and the Director General

3rd Respondent by letter dated 25.07.2015, 21.08.2015 and 01.09.2015.

It also observed that the Road Development Engineers Association

(RDEA) also raised their concern on this issue by letter dated

24.08.2015. There was no reply from the Respondents. The 3rd

Respondent by letter dated 02.09.2015 (P22) replied to the President of

RDEA that this transfer IS a pure administrative decision on the

exigency of the service.

In the absence of any explanation as to why the Petitioner could not

come before court in time is considered as delay in a reVIew

application. (Samaraweera v Ministry of Public Administration 2003

3 SLR 640ahanayake v Sri Lanka Insurance Co 2005 1 SLR 67.

In the case of Selleviratne v. Tissa Dias Bandaranayake and another

1992 2SLR 341 Amerasinghe, J adverting to the question of long delay,

commented that-

Uf( a person were negligent fiJr a long and unreasonable time,

the law refused afterwards t6 lend him any assistance to enforce

his rights; the law both to punish his neglect, nam leges

vigilantibus, non dormientibus, subveniunt, and for other reasons

refuses to assist those who sleep over their rights and are not

vigilant. "

In the case of Jayaweera vs. Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian

Service (1996) 2 SLR 70 at 73 the Court of Appeal held:

C.A.Writ 356/2015 Order Page 7/14

"Petitioner seeking a prerogative writ is not entitled to relief as

a matter of course or as a matter of right or as a routine. Even

(f he is entitled to relief still court has discretion to deny him

relief having regard to his conduct, delay, loaches, waiver,

submissions to jurisdiction are all valid impediments which stand

against the grant of relief"

The above decisions clearly explains what is a delay and wheen the

Petitioner be punished of laches. In this case it is clear that the

Petitioner had raised his voice with the management but it IS the

Respondent who ignored and pushed the Petitioner to seek the relief

from the Court.

Considering all circumstances m this case I do not find the Petitioner

IS guilty of laches.

It will be preferable to visit all facts briefly for the purpose of

commg to a reasonable conclusion. There was an advertisements

calling for application for the post of Chief Engineer (Kurunegala).

This circular bears a No -2015/eL/37 dated 02.07.2015 (PIO). The

requirement for the ab<,ve p<'5ition was Chief Senior Engineer who are

In grade 2 -I or grade I In the R.D.A. The said circular was

cancelled by administration circular No. 2015/CL/37(J). This circular

was dated 16.07.2015 was marked as P12. In this circular it was

stated calling for application for the post of Chief Engineer.

(Kurunegala) is hereby cancelled.

It is revealed that the Chief Engineer of Gampaha (18th Respondent)

was transferred to Kurunegala. It IS further revealed that the said

transfer was on the basis of annual transfer.

It was submitted that the vacancy arouse at Gampaha was advertised,

an interview was held and a suitable candidate was selected (R I).

The Petitioner who is qualified to apply for the post of Chief

Engineer (Kurunegala), submitted his application on the 14th of July

2015. When the advertisement was cancelled the Petitioner raised his

concern with the Respondent, and there was no reply from

respondents. At this juncture the President of Road Development

Engineers Association (RDEA) made representation to the Director

Genernl nnd rC!cC!ivC!d rC!sl'onse saying that "In respect of Gampaha and

Kurunegala transfers are pure administrative decision on exigency

of service."

The Respondents in their statement of objection submitted when the

post of Chief Engineer Kurunegala became vacant, the Chief Engineer

of Gampaha requested a transfer to Kurunegala. Considering his

request the I st respondent decided to transfer him to Kurunegala. The

Respondents in their written submissions took a completely different

stance and states that the transfers are pure administrative decision on

eXigency of service.

The Petitioner submits that the transfers are based on the circular

marked (P 17) which sets out the policy guidelines, procedures to be

followed In annual transfers. Among many things there are

classification of popular and non-popular stations. The Kurunegala and

Gampaha both are listed under popular station category. As per 3.1 of

the said circular an employee who is in service in a popular station

for a mInInmm of 5 years or 3 years In a non-popular station is

qualified for annual transfer.

The Petitioner submits the 18th Respondent had assumed office as

Chief Engineer, Gampaha on the 10.10.2012 as of July 2015 he had

not even completed 3 years at a popular station. This submissions was

never rejected or contrarily explained by any respondents.

The Petitioner brings to the notice of the Court that there are direct

allegation submitted against the 18th Respondent, but he had not filed

any objection, up to now. The petitioner submits neither the 18th

Respondent nor other respondents had not explained or submitted any

documents regarding the request of the 18th Respondent to the 1 st

Respondent of the transfer or any other details of this posting.

The Petitioner makes a direct allegation of cancellation of PI 0 by P 12

IS arbitrary, contrary to legitimate expectation, unreasonable, contrary

to procedureal expectation by the respondents. The Respondents had

not denied nor submitted the explanation for their act. In the

statement of objections it was stated that the transfer was made on .

request. But in the written submission the respondents submitted that

the transfer was due to exigency of service.

The Petitioner categorically submits he is not seeking that he be

appointed as Chief Engineer Kurunegala, but he prays that the proper ,

and due process be always followed which is legitimate, reasonable

and just.

Al

In Wickremaratne and Jayaratne and others (200 I) 3SLLR 161. Justice

Gunawardhana says "The doctrine of legitimate expectation is not

limited to cases involving a legitimate expectation of a hearing before

some right or expectation was affected but is also extended to

situations even where no right to be heard was available or existed

but fairness required a public body or officials to act In compliance

with its public undertakings and asSurances."

"Public officers or the State although are at liberty to alter the policy.

Yet by no means are free to ignore legitimate expectations engendered

by there actions and lor conduct."

In Tokyo cement company (Lanka) Ltd Vs Director General of

Customs and 4 others. 2005 (BLR) 24 The Supreme Court observed

as follows:

C.A.Writ 356/2015 Order Page 12114

A legitimate expectation has to be taken In the sence of an

expectation which will be protected by law. In the case of Regina Vs

Secretary of State for Education and Employment, Ex Parte Begnie

W.L.R. 2000 Vol. I page 115, the Court of Appeal of England held

that the "Court would not give effect to a 'legitimate expectation' if

it would require a public authority to act contrary to the terms of the

Statute."

Considering all submissions before us, it IS clear that the 18th

respondent was transferred from a popular station to another popular

station without following accepted procedures and standered rules.

Respondents by merely submitting, pure administration decision on

exigency service will not and should not cover the improper act. The

Court will not accept cover up stories for breach of standared

practices and legitimate expectation.

After careful consideration the Court finds the issuance of cancellation

of calling for applications and interview dated 16.07.2015 is arbitrary

and contrary to the standard rules therefore the Court issues the Writ

C.A.Writ 356/2015 Order Page 13/14

,

14

of Certiorari and quash the administrative circular above mention

marked P12.

Further the COUl1 issue a Writ of Mandamus on the 15t to the 17th

Respondents to call for application and conduct interviews to fill the

vacancy for the Post of Chief Engineer of Kurunegala forthwith.

Considering the nature of application this Court orders 15t to the 1 i h

Respondents to pay cost to the Petitioner.

Application allowed with costs.
