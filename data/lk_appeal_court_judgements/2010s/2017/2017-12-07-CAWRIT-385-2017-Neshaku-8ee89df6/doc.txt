L.T.B. Dehideniya J. (PICA)

This is an application for mandate in the nature of writs of certiorari and

prohibition. The Petitioner is a director of Land Reform Commission (LRC)

attached to Batticaloa district. He states that he was actively engaged in

recovering the possession of lands belonging to the LRC from the unlawful

occupiers. As a result of his work in this field, he states that he was shot by

unknown persons and was critically injured and was hospitalized in

Batticaloa and Colombo for some time and had to undergo several sllrgeries.

Even after doing six surgeries, still his right hand is not fully functional. The

Petitioner states that he has to undergo further surgeries and have to

continue with the physiotherapy treatments.

The Petitioner further stated that he was transferred from Batticaloa to

Colombo with effect from the 1 st of December. Without any application

made by the Petitioner, this transfer had been affected. He had made several

appeals to the authorities and he has come to know that the 3rd Respondent,

the Member of Parliament for the Batticaloa District had made a complaint

to the Hon. Speaker of the Parliament and on that complaint the Speaker had

informed the Hon, Minister to take necessary steps. No documentary proof

is tendered to establish this fact and the Petitioner states that even after the

request; he was not provided the documents.

The Petitioner admits that in a meeting with the 3rd Respondent unpleasant

situation has arisen but after police intervention both parties have settled the

matter. The Petitioner further states that the police have reported that there

is no reason to precede any further.

The Petitioner's grievance is that the said transfer is arbitrary. The learned

President's Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that Public service

Commission had issued certain rules in relation to transfers and it has made

it mandatory to give reasons for the transfer. In the present case, the

Petitioner was not informed the reasons for the transfer and therefore the

transfer is arbitrary. The learned Counsel further submits that the Superior

Courts have emphasized the necessity to give the reasons for the transfer.

It has been held in the case of SLR - 1997 Vol. 1, Page No -16

TENNAKOON, ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE v. T P. F

DE SIL VA, INSPECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE AND OTHERS at page

32 onwards the Court had explained the necessity to give reasons for an

administrative decision held that;

4

In another context, in Wickramabandu v Herath(3), a Bench of five

Judges referred to the need to scrutinize the reasons for a detention

order issued by the Secretary, Defence and held a detention to be

unlawful.

As to the failure to give reasons for administrative decisions, Wade's

observations - in the context of judicial review - apply with even

greater force in our fundamental rights jurisdiction, especially the

equal protection of the law:

" .... there is a strong case to be made for the giving of reasons as an

essential element of administrative justice. . . . Unless the citizen can

discover the reason behind the decision, he may be unable to tell

whether it is reviewable or not, and so he may be deprived of the

protection of the t'aw. A right to reasons is therefore an indispensable

part of a sound system of judicial review. Natural justice may provide

the best rubric for it, since the giving of reasons is required by the

ordinary man's sense of justice. It is also a healthy discipline for all

who exercise power over others .... Although there is no general rule

of law requiring the giving of reasons, an administrative authority

may be unable to show that it has acted lawfully unless it explains

itself." (Administrative Law, 7th ed, pp 542-543)

Among the cases he cites is R. v. Civil Service Appeal Board, ex p.

Cunningham (4), which was an application for judicial review of a

decision assessing compensation for the unfair dismissal of a prison

officer. It was held that:

". . . . the board should have given outline reasons sufficient to show

that they were directing their mind and thereby indirectly showing not

whether their decision was right or wrong, which is a matter solely

for them, but whether their decision was lawful. Any other conclusion

5

would reduce the board to the status of a freewheeling palm tree ....

The board's objection to giving reasons... is that this would tend to

militate against informality and would lead to an undesirable

reliance upon a body of precedent. I find this totally unconvincing.

The evidence shows that those who advise applicants and

departments do so frequently and must be well aware of the board's

previous decisions and of the circumstances in which they were made.

There must therefore already be a body of precedent. If the board

have no regard to their previous decisions, they must be acting

inconsistently and be failing to do justice as between applicants. This

I am loathe to believe .... fairness requires a tribunal such as the

board to give sufficient reasons for its decision to enable the parties

to know the issues to which it addressed its mind and that it acted

lawfully." (pp 319-320)

I hold that to justify a transfer of a public officer on the ground of the

lack of a satisfactory working relationship with another person, a

wholly subjective opinion, or a mere assertion to that effect, is quite

insufficient. First, it is not at all enough to show that there are

disagreements or disputes or a mere lack of harmony between them:

the problem must relate to their working relationship. An act done by

one person which impinges on the official duties of a public officer

may create such disharmony, but that does not mean that there is an

unsatisfactory working relationship between them. A working

relationship is that which exists between superior and subordinate, or

colleague and colleague, in one workplace; or even between two

persons in different departments, institutions or services, when the

public interest requires that they work together. Nothing has been

said in the pleadings or in the submissions to satisfy this CO,urt that

any working relationship was required between the 3rd respondent

and the petitioner. The only material placed before the Court - apart

from vague allegations - is that the petitioner was investigating

certain offences. If at all he was required to have a working

relationship with anyone in regard to those investigations, Chapter

XI of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act suggests that it was with

the Magistrate IS Court. The 3rd respondent had, indeed, the right to

complain about the petitioner to his superior, but that has nothing to

do with working relationships.

Let me assume, however, that such a working relationship was

required, in the public interest. A bare assertion that it was

unsatisfactory is not enough. The Court must ascertain whether there

were grounds for that opinion, and, if there were, it must examine

those grounds; upon such an examination the Court is not entitled to

substitute its own opinion, simply because it disagrees with the 1st

respondent; and it can only intervene if that opinion is found to be

arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or discriminatory (or otherwise

violative of fundamental rights).

In the case of Jayaweera v. Prof. Dayasiri Fernando and others SC FR

484/2011 sc minutes dated 16.01.2017 it was held that;

"Transfers are fourfold as indicated below

(i) Transfers done annually;

(ii) Transfers done on exigencies of service;

(iii) Transfers done on disciplinary grounds;

(iv) Mutual Transfers on requests made by Officers. "

It was not in dispute that the Petitioner was initially transferred by

PI0 to Gampaha Bandaranayake Vidyalaya and the next day to the

7

Ministry of Education by P 11. None of the transfer orders convey any

reasons to the Petitioner for such transfers as contemplated in

Clauses 221 and 222 of the Procedural Rules. Giving of reasons is an

essential element of administration of justice. A right to reason is,

therefore, an indispensable part of a sound system of judicial review.

Reasoned decision is not only for the purpose of showing that the

citizen is receiving justice, but also a valid discipline for the

administrative body itself. Conveying reasons is calculated to prevent

unconscious, unfairness or arbitrariness in reaching the conclusions.

The very search for reasons will put the authority on the alert and

minimize the chances of unconscious infiltration of bias or unfairness

in the conclusion. The duty to adduce reasons will be regarded as fair

and legitimate by a reasonable man and will discard irrelevant and

extraneous considerations. Therefore, conveying reasons is one of the

essentials of justice (Vide S. N Mukherjee Vs. Union of India (1990)

4 S.Cc.c. 594; A.I.R. 1990 S.c. 1984)

When leave to proceed was granted on 02.12.2011, this Court made

the following observations :

"If the transfer is on "exigencies of service" or a "transfer on

disciplinary grounds" in terms of Rules 221 and/or 222, the

appointing autho.rity is mandated to convey the reasons for

such transfers in writing to the Officer concerned The

documents marked PI 0 and P 11 do not give any reasons.

In the present case there is no reason given for the transfer. The Petitioner

had not completed the normal transferable period of four years, had not

made any application for a transfer. The transfer order does not give any

indication that it was done due to the exigencies of services too. The

Petitioner states that he was called for a disciplinary inquiry by a telephone

I,If ! ti I, ! t! , ! ! i , I !II I

8

call but was not served with a charge sheet or was not asked to show cause

and given any order. Therefore the Court can consider that it is not a formal

disciplinary inquiry but an informal fact finding discussion. Therefore, the

transfer cannot be a one made on disciplinary grounds and there is no

indication to the fact that the transfer was on the disciplinary grounds.

Under these circumstances, the Petitioner has established a prima facie case

that the transfer is arbitrary.

Unless the Court issues an interim order, the application will be nugatory

because the Petitioner has to assume duties in the new station from the 1 st of

December.

On the above reasons, I issue an interim order as prayed for in the paragraph

(1) of the prayer of the petition for 14 days.

I order to issue notice to the Respondents.
