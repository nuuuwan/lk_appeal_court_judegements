Petitioner is absent and unrepresented. On the last occasion the counsel for

the Petitioner moved for time to file counter objections but several occasions

they have not done so. When this case was taken up on 02.02.2017 counsel

for the Petitioner has informed court that he has no instructions to file counter

objections. Therefore the Registrar was directed to issue notice on the

Petitioner informing the date of the argument. Notices have been dispatched,

but the 8th Respondent Petitioner is absent and unrepresented. Therefore, it

seems that Petitioner is not interested in pursuing this matter. Counsel for

the Petitioner -Respondent and Respondent -Respondents move that this

Revision application is dismissed with costs.
