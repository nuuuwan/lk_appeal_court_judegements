JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for all the Parties when this case came up on 2017-06-23

before us, agreed to have this case disposed of by way of written

submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral submissions.

They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment after

considering the written submissions they would file. Therefore, this

judgment is based on the material that has been adduced by parties in

their pleadings and the written submissions.

The Petitioner- Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant) had filed an application in the Provincial High Court of the

Sabaragamuwa Province holden at Ratnapura praying for a writ of

i! If t: f I f ! i

,

4

Certiorari to quash the letter dated 2007-05-07. That is a letter by which

the 2nd Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

2nd Respondent) had informed the Appellant that the 1st Respondent -

Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Respondent) had

by letter dated 2007-03-20 confirmed that back wages for 09 months and

gratuity had been payed to the Appellant by the 1st Respondent.

Further, the Appellant had also prayed from the Provincial High Court a

writ of mandamus relating to the payment of back wages gratuity and

delayed payment charges.

Perusal of the judgment dated 2010-02-24 pronounced by the learned

Provincial High Court Judge shows that he has refused the application of

the Appellant on the grounds;

i. that the Appellant had not specified the person on whom the writ of

Mandamus should be issued;

ii. that the document P 7 (b) which the Appellant requests to be

quashed does not contain any decision but only contains a mere

reply to a letter providing thereby an already existing information;

!

!

iii. that the Appel/ant had failed to tender a copy of the letter dated

2007-01-25 which is required for the court to form a view about the

nature of the request of the appel/ant;

iv. that in any case the Appel/ant had not demanded any of the reliefs

prayed from Court, from any relevant authority before he filed this

application in the Provincial High Court.

Despite the fact that it is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed

this appeal in this Court, the written submission filed in this Court on his

behalf does not submit, for consideration of this Court, any ground as to

why the learned Provincial High Court Judge's conclusions should be

quashed by this Court. Thus, this Court has to proceed on the basis that

there indeed exists not a single ground for this appeal. Resultant position

would be for this Court to conclude that this is a frivolous appeal, which

has been filed without any justifiable reason.

On the other hand, this Court is satisfied after perusal of the judgment of

the learned Provincial High Court Judge that the conclusions arrived at and

the reasons given thereto by him are in order and thus requires no

intervention by this Court.

6

In these circumstances, this Court affirms the judgment of the learned

Provincial High Court Judge dated 2010-02-24 and proceed to dismiss this

appeal with costs.
