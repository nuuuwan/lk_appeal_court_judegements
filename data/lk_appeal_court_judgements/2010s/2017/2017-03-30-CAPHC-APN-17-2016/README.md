This is a revision application filed by the 3rd Accused Petitioner

(hereinafter sometimes called and referred to as the Petitioner) seeking to set

aside or vary the sentence imposed on him. the Petitioner with six other

accused were indicted before the High Court of Colombo on several

charges punishable under sections 140,435 read with 146,435 read with 32,

380 read with 146, 380 read with 32 and 3830f the Penal Code. After trial

the Accused were found guilty and were convicted. On 18.12.2009 the

Petitioner was sentenced as follows;

1 st count 6 months RI

2nd count 10 years RI and Rs. 10,0001- fine in default 6 months RI

The Petitioner, after more than 6 years, on 19th February 2016,

presented this revision application (the petition dated 29th December 2015

but was filed in court only on 19th February 2016) to set aside or vary the

sentence.

The learned DSG raised several preliminary objections on the

maintainability of this application such as the delay and the absences of the

exceptional circumstances.

The Petitioner's explanation for the delay is that he was in prison

serving the sentence and there was no way for him to communicate with the

family to get the legal assistances. The exceptional circumstance he pleads

is that he was in remand custody during the pendency of the trial and it

prevented him obtaining proper legal assistances. He further submits that the

Court has recorded the facts submitted in mitigation incorrectly.

The revisionary jurisdiction of this Court is a discretionary remedy

and no party can invoke the said jurisdiction as of a right. A party seeking

involvement of a superior Court in exercising the revisionary jurisdiction

has to establish that he has exceptional circumstances warranting the

involvement.

Dharmaratne and another V Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd and

others [2003J 3 Sri L R 24

Per Amaratunga, J.

"Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the

court selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method

of rectification should be adopted, if such a selection process is not

there revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of

every litigant to make a second appeal in the garb of a Revision

Application or to make an appeal in situations where the legislature

has not given a right of appeal. "

The practice of Court to insist on the existence of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep

III

root in our law and has got hardened into a rule which should not be

lightly disturbed. The words used by the legislature do not indicate

that it ever intended to interfere with this 'rule of practice'.

Cadiragamapulle vs. Ceylon Paper Sacs Ltd. [2001] 3 Sri L R 112

(ii) No exceptional circumstances are disclosed why his application

for revisionary relief should be entertained after the lapse of nearly

two years.

(iii) ... ...

(iv) The existence of exceptional circumstances is a pre conditionfor

the exercise of the powers of Revis ion. f

In the present case the only exceptional circumstance pleaded is that

he was in remand prison prior to conviction and was serving the term of

imprisonment thereafter and was unable to obtain legal assistances. I do not

agree with this submission. Firstly, the Petitioner was defended by an

Attorney At Law at the trial and on his behalf submissions were made in

mitigation. Secondly, the Petitioner would have communicated with the

family while in the prison. The prisoners are allowed to communicate with

outsiders by using the postal service. The Petitioner without utilizing that

facility now cannot be heard to say that he was unable to communicate with

the family. The reason given by the Petitioner cannot be considered as an

exceptional circumstance which warrants the invoking the extra ordinary

jurisdiction of revision.

The sentence was imposed on 18.12.2009 and the revision application

was presented on 19.02.2016, which is with a delay of more than 6 years.

As I pointed out, the failure to communicate with the family is not

acceptable. There is no other explanation given for the delay. A party

seeking to invoke the discretionary jurisdiction of revision has to act

promptly. The undue delay defeats the remedy.

H. A. M. Cassim V. Government Agent, Batticaloa 69 NLR 403

An application in revision must be made promptly if it is to be

entertained by the Supreme Court. There must be finality in litigation,

even if incorrect orders have to go unreversed.

In the case of Urban Development Authority Vs Wejayaluxmi

[2006] 3 Sri L R 62 it was held that;

(4) When there is a satisfactory explanation with regard to the delay

and the period of delay is not excessive and if it appears that the

impugned order is manifestly erroneous application should not be

dismissed simply on the grounds of delay.

In the present case the delay is more than 6 years and it is clearly

excessive. The reason given for the delay is also unacceptable. The

Petitioner was convicted after trial and was sentenced. Before passing the

sentence, the learned High Court Judge has afforded the opportunity to

mitigate. The Petitioner submits that the mitigation was recorded

incorrectly, but has not tendered any supporting document such as an

affidavit from the Attorney At Law who appeared for him or any other

similar evidence to substantiate the ligation. The file of record maintained in

the Court is presumed to be correct. Section 114( d) of the Evidence

Ordinance provides that the judicial and official acts have been regularly

performed. Therefore, without adequate proof, the file of record maintained

in Court cannot be disproved. Under these circumstances, the allegation that

the mitigation was recorded incorrectly is not acceptable. There is no

significant error in passing the sentence. Therefore the case of Urban

Development Authority Vs Wejayaluxmi (supra) cannot be applied to the

present case.

Gnanapandithen and another v. Balanayagam and another [1998]

1 Sri L R 391 is a case where the Court has failed to investigate the title in a

partition action. The Court held in that case that;

On a consideration of the proceedings in this case, I hold that there

has been a miscarriage of justice. The object of the power of revision

as stated by Sansoni CJ in Mariam Beebee v. Seyed Mohamed (4) "is

the due administration of justice .... " In the words of Soza, J in

Somawathie v. Madawala and others (5). "The court will not hesitate

to use its revisionary powers to give relief where a miscarriage of

justice has occurred . .. Indeed the facts of this case cry aloud for

the intervention of this court to prevent what otherwise would be a

miscarriage of justice." The words underlined above are equally

applicable to the present case. I am accordingly of the view that the

Court of Appeal was in serious error when it declined to exercise its

revisionary powers having regard to the very special and exceptional

circumstances of this partition case.

As I pointed out earlier, there was no miscarriage of justice in the

present case. Therefore the long delay of more than 6 years matters.

Under these circumstances, I uphold the preliminary objection and

dismiss the revision application.

Judge of the Court of Appeal

H.C.J.Madawala J.

I agree.
