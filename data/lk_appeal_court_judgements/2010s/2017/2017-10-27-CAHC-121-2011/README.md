Argued &

Decided on 02.10.2017.

L.U.Jayasuriya, J.

The Accused-Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Badulla for

the murder of a woman named Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Vijaya Kumari.

After trial the learned High Court Judge convicted the Accused -Appellant

and imposed death sentence. The 2nd Accused -Appellant was acquitted on

the charges leveled against him. Prosecution witness No: 05 Jayathilaka

he has narrated the incident before the High Court and has explained as to

how the incident took place but the learned High Court Judge has

disregarded his evidence on the basis that he was an accomplice and that

he was a suspect in the Magistrate Court. We find that there is

overwhelming evidence against the Accused -Appellant and such evidence

has not been considered by the learned High Court Judge. Therefore we
