The 1 stAccused-Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kurunegala under section 296 of the Penal Code for the murder of a person named Devendra Mulacharige Siyadoris Hamy.

The 2nd Accused was indicted under section 296 read with section 102 for aiding and abetting to commit murder.

The High Court, after trial convicted the 1st Accused-Appellant for murder and sentenced him to death. The 2nd Accused was acquitted.

This appeal is from the said conviction and the sentence.

The story of the prosecution is that the deceased had been sleeping on a carpenter's table in the verandah on the day in question when the son of the deceased had heard the deceased shouting "i)@c 8a3@~2Sf qi)znt):)".

He had rushed out and switched on the verandah light and opened the door. While opening the door, he has seen the 1st Accused withdrawing the knife from the body of the deceased.

The Accused-Appellant is a close relation of the 1st witness.

The Counsel for the Appellant argued that the 2nd witness has heard the 1stAccused-Appellant calling "q25J@25J q25J@25J". But this utterance was not heard by the first witness. The 2nd witness however, has stated since they are cousins, he could identify the Appellant's Voice.

Both the 1st and the 2nd witnesses have seen the Appellant near the deceased.

The 2nd witness too had heard the deceased shouting "i)@c 8a3@~2Sf

qi)znth" (vide page 76 of the brief) prior to which he had heard the 1st

Accused-Appellant uttering the words "q25J@25J q25J@25J".

The 2nd witness too had gone out with the 1 st witness at the same time and has seen the 1st Accused-Appellant withdrawing the knife.

The learned Counsel for the 1st Accused-Appellant further argued that the 1st Witness's evidence contradicted with the evidence of the 2nd

Witness.

On a perusal of the evidence we find that it is not so.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant argued that the dock statement of the 1st Accused-Appellant was not analyzed by the learned High Court Judge. The 1st Accused-Appellant in his dock statement has stated that he was arrested by the Police and remanded in the year 2003 having been produced before a doctor. The Appellant has not referred to the incident in his evidence although the eye-witnesses have categorically stated that they witnessed the attack which resulted in the murder.

At page 152 of the brief, the learned High Court Judge has considered the dock statement.

For the forgoing reasons, we are not inclined to set aside a well-considered judgment.

The judgment dated 14.06.2007 is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed.

Appeal Dismissed.
