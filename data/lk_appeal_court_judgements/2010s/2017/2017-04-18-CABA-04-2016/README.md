ORDER

P.R. Walgama, J

The instant order concerns an application made by the

Petitioner in terms of Section 10 (l)(a) of the Assistance

to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses

Act No.04 of 2015 Read along with the Bail Act.

The petition dated 27th July 2016 the petitioner has

stated the following;

That the Respondent instituted action against the

Petitioner In the Magistrate Courts of Kalawana for

2

committing an offence under Sections 315 and 317 of

the Penal Code. The Petitioner was produced before the

Magistrate Court of Kalawana and was remanded on

14.05.2016.

Further a report has been filed by the Respondent

stating that investigations had revealed that the Petitioner

had committed an offence under Section 8(2) of the

Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and

Witnesses Act No. 4 of 2015, as he had caused Injury

to one Delwala Kukulage Prematilleke by using sharp

knife on or about 11.05.2016 who was an eyewitness

of the case bearing No. 248 /15 of the Magistrate Court

of Kalawana, filed against the Accused - Petitioner and

thereby had committed an offence in terms of Section

8 (2) (a) of the said Act No. 4 of 2015.

It is contended by the Petitioner that it was the victim

who initiated the scuffle and he was attacked by the

victim with a knife, and as such the Petitioner has

exercised the right of private defence.

It is alleged by the Petitioner that although initially he

was charged under Section 315 and 31 7 without proper

3

basis the Respondent had charged him under the above

Section 8(2)(a) of the Act No. 4 of 2015. Therefore it

1S seen that the Petitioner had been languishing in remand

S1nce 14.05.2016 up to date.

Besides it is stated by the Petitioner that he 1S suffering

from a heart condition and therefore moves this court

to act under Section 10(1) of the Act No. 4 of 2015

and grant him bail.

In making this application for bail 1n terms of the

above section the Petitioner has urged the following

exceptional circumstances to be considered 1n granting

bail.

In that it 1S stated that the Respondent has not

considered the fact that the Petitioner too was injured

by the said altercation. The Petitioner 1S of 60 years

of age, and is suffering from a heart deceased and is

under regular medication.

In the above setting it 1S noted, and the court 1S

inclined to enlarge the Petitioner on bail.

4

The sse for the Respondent had no objections for the

Petitioner being released on bail on the conditions as

stated here under.

The Petitioner shall deposit a sum of Rs. 10,000/- in cash.

Shall enter into a personal bond to the value of

Rs. 100,000/- and a certified bond to the value of Rs.

20,000/-.

Shall not interfere with the witnesses in the above case.

Accordingly application for bail is allowed.

K.K. Wickramasinghe, J I agree.
