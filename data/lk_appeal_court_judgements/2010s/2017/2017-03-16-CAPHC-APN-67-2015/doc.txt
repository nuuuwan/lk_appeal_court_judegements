The plaintiff Respondent Respondent (the Respondent) being a

finance company, instituted action in the Magistrate Court of Colombo as

a private plaint against the Defendant! Accused Petitioner Petitioner (the

Petitioner) for issuing a cheque knowingly that there is no funds in the

account an offence punishable under section 25 (1) of the Debt Recovery

(Special Provisions) Act No.2 of 1990 as amended. The Petitioner raised

several preliminary objections on the maintainability of the action. The

learned Magistrate dismissed the said objections. The Petitioner appealed

to the High Court of Colombo was also dismissed. This revision

application is from the said dismissal.

The first objection of the Petitioner is that the complaint made to

the Magistrate Court is bad in law and the learned Magistrate should not

have issued summons. His contention is that there is no Board resolution

authorizing this private plaint. The plaint was filed in the Magistrate

Court by one Mohamed Saleem Mohamed W smi but has failed to tender

the Board resolution. He further argues that the copy of the Board

resolution filed with the counter objections of the Respondent also does

not empower the said Wasmi to file this action on the cheque but it is

only to file action based on the lease agreement.

The Board of Directors of the Company has resolved that the

"Company nominate Mr. Mohamed Saleem Mohamed Wasmi to

represent the Company, to file action, give evidence on behalf of the

company in Criminal Courts, with regard to the Contract No. HOLELE

0301323400 against Mr. Y.M.H. Samarakoon." The Petitioner argues that

the said Wasmi was authorized to file action with regard to the contract

entered in to by the Petitioner and the Respondent, but it does not

authorize him to file action with regard to a cheque. The Board of

Directors of the Company by the resolution dated 4th July 2012, has in

f' I I

clear terms authorized the said Wasmi to "represent the Company and to

file action on behalf of the Company in criminal courts." The resolution

has limited the action to matters "with regard to the agreement" that the

parties had entered in to. The Petitioner's contention is that this resolution

limits the authority of the said Wasmi to file an action on the contract. If

the Board of Directors intended to limit the action to a civil remedy on

the contract, will not authorize him to file action and appear in a criminal

Court. Authorizing him to file action and appear in criminal Court itself

explain that the intention of the Board of Directors is to file action in the

criminal Court against the Petitioner. The Respondent's allegation is that

the Petitioner had issued a cheque knowingly that there are no funds in

his account to honour the cheque, which is an offence under the Debt

Recovery (Special Provisions) Act. The cheque in question was issued in

settlement of a part payment of the money due on the said agreement and

it becomes a matter with regard to the agreement. The authorization of

Wasmi by the Board of Directors includes the filing of the criminal action

for issuing a cheque without funds.

The Petitioner argues that the failure to tender the said board

resolution with the complaint should have been considered by the

Magistrate Court as fatal and summons should not have been issued. The

complainant made to the Magistrate Court contains the statement that a

resolution has been passed by the Board of Directors authorizing him to

file action. The learned Magistrate had enough material to issue

summons, the rest is to be proved at the trial.

It was held in the case of Malinie Gunarathne Additional District

Judge Galle v. Abeysinghe and another [1994] 3 Sri L R 196 that;

The proper test is to ascertain whether on the material before

Court, prima facie, there is sufficient ground on which it may be

reasonably inferred that the offence alleged in the complaint or

plaint has been committed by the person who is accused of it.

The Petitioner raised another objection that there is no

consideration when filing the action in relation of the cheque. The

consideration at the time of issuing the cheque was the part payment of

the money due in the lease agreement. Therefore there cannot be said that

there is no consideration for the cheque. The Petitioner's argument is that

the matter has been referred to arbitration and an award has been granted

and therefore there is no consideration at the time of filing the action.

This argument is not tenable. The offence was committed at the time of

issuing the cheque, not at the time of filing action.

Another issue is whether there is a double jeopardy. Civil liability

and the criminal liability are to distinct liabilities. A person's civil

liability does not relieve him from his criminal liability and vice versa.

Simple example is the civil liability on injuria does not relieve him from

the criminal liability of violating the traffic rules in a case of an accident.

The Legislature has recognized this principal and the Evidence Ordinance

was amended by act No. 33 of 1998 and made a conviction in a criminal

court, a relevant fact. The arbitration award is for the civil liability and it

does not take away the criminal liability of issuing a cheque knowingly

that there are no funds.

The Legislature has enacted by the Debt Recovery (Special

Previsions) Act section 25(1) (a) that any person who draws, a cheque

knowing that there are no funds or not sufficient funds in the bank to

honour such cheque shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall

on conviction by a Magistrate alter summary trial be liable to punishment

with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to

one year or with fine of ten thousand rupees or ten per centum of the full

tlI I.

,

I I

value of the cheque, order, authority or inland bill in respect of which the

offence is committed, whichever is higher, or with both such fine and

imprisonment.

In the case of The OIC CID and another v. A.C. Soris [2005] BLR

100 it was held that;

Even if a cheque is drawn in favour of any person other than a

lending institution, Section 25(1) of the Debt Recovery (Special

Provisions) Act applies thereto and prosecution can be instituted

under that section.

The Petitioner's argument on res judicata does not come in as the

earlier arbitration award is on the civil liability and the present action is

on the criminal liability .

Under these circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the

finding of the learned Magistrate as well as the learned High Court Judge.

I affirm the order of the learned High Court Judge and dismiss this

application subject to costs fixed at Rs. 10,0001-
