This is an appeal from the High Court of Rathnapura.

The Petitioner Petitioner Appellant ( the Respondent) filed

information under section 66 of the Primary Court Procedure Act in the

Magistrate Court Rathnapura on a land dispute threatening the breach of the

peace. The dispute is over the road way used by the Petitioner as the access

road to his residence. The Petitioner's case is that the road that he used for

about 20 years to access his house was through his brother the land of the

Respondent Respondent Appellant (the Appellant). With the consent and the

financial assistance of the Respondent a gate was erected at the entrance but

himself and his brother used the road without any obstacle. On or about

12.01.2016 the Appellant padlocked the gate and obstructed the usage of the

road and on or about 1.01.2016 a barbed wire fence was erected and further

obstructed the read way. Questioning on this a breach of the peace became

likely. The Appellant's case is that the Respondent never used this road but

they have an alternative road through the railway track.

The learned Magistrate determined that the Respondent has

established that he has used this road for a period of time but has failed to

prove that he used for 10 years to accrue the prescriptive right over the road

and on revision the High Court set aside the order of the Magistrate Court

and ordered that the Respondent is entitle to use the road. Being aggrieved,

the Appellant presented this appeal.

The learned Magistrate has accepted the fact that the road in question

was used by the Respondent. He further considered that the electricity and

4

the telephone lines were laid out though this road. The significant fact of the

two mail boxes giving the addresses of the two houses of the Appellant and

the Respondent was also considered by the learned Magistrate in his order.

All these facts direct only on one direction; that is that the road in question

was used by the Respondent for a long time.

The question is that how long it has been used. The learned

Magistrate was of the view that the Respondent has failed to establish that

he used it for ten years. The learned Magistrate has failed to consider the

affidavit evidence of the neighbours. Several neighbours have testified that

this road was used by the Respondent for more than 10 years. P 18, P 19,

P20, P21 and P22 are affidavits sworn by the neighbours to the effect that

the said road was in Respondent's use for more than 10 years.

Though the Respondent submitted in his affidavit that this road was

In the Appellant's land, the plan No. 3082 prepared by the Licensed

Surveyor B.A.Thambaiah shows that it is a separate block of land reserved

as a road way. This further establishes by the Appellant's deed No. 1789

attested by the NP B.L.Abeyrathne where the southern boundary of the

Respondent land is describe as the "Common Road depicted as lot 21"

which is the road in question. This deed was attested on 30th April, 1979.

The road was in existence even then.

The learned High Court Judge has correctly decided that the

Respondent had used the road for more than 10 years.

Whether there is an alternative road is not a question that has to be

considered in this case. In an action in a competent civil court for a right of

way of necessity this matter can be considered. Therefore whether the

rail way track can be used as a roadway or not does not arias for

consideration.

5

Under these circumstances, I do not see any reason to interfere with

the finding of the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 10,000.00
