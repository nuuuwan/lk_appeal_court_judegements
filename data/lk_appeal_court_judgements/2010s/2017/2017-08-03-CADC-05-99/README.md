This is a partition action bearing No. P/23447 in the District

Court of Kegalle filed seeking to terminate the co-ownership of the

Plaintiff and the Defendants. The Learned District Judge in her

judgment dated 13.11.1998 at page 219 of the Appeal Brief

dismissed the Plaintiffs case and declared that the Defendants had

acquired prescriptive title to their plots of lands.

This is an appeal filed by the Plaintiff-Appellant against the

said judgment moving for setting aside the judgment of the District

Judge of Kegalle and to decide the case in favour of the Plaintiff.

The Plaintiff -Appellant appealed against the above said

judgment and prayed to dismiss the appeal and requested to order

de-novo. 1st Defendant-Respondent tendered written submissions

in this appeal and has prayed to dismiss the appeal and grant relief

prayed for.

(It is to be noted that the Plaintiff-Appellant in his written

submissions tendered to this Court had referred to a judgment

delivered in the District Court of Galle and not Kegalle. Averments

19, we presume that this is a mistake made inadvertently.)

This subject matter of the case is the land called Ehalawatta

situated in the jurisdictional area of the Kegalle District Court.

Accordingly, the main issue of the case had been whether the

Defendant-Respondents had prescribed their shares to the said

corpus by acquiring prescriptive rights to the respective plots of

land.

The Plaintiffs position was that this was a co-owned property,

which had not been lawfully divided and demarcated, and hence

the co-ownership till continues and prayed to partition the corpus

according to the statements of claims.

The learned trial Judge has come to the conclusion that

according to the evidence revealed that the Defendant-Respondents

had possessed the separate block of lands not as a co-owners but

as sole owners. Therefore, they had acquired prescriptive rights to

the portions of the lands they were possession for the last 50 years

with demarcated the definite boundaries. Vide page 225 of the

appeal brief.

The Plaintiffs position was that the Plaintiff and the co-

owners in their statements of claims admitted that this is a co-

owned property.

I t is to be further noted that none of the parties to the action

prayed for dismissal of the partition action. In the light of this

5

issue the Plaintiff-Appellant has prayed to this Court to refer this

case for re-trial to the original court.

It is pertinent at this stage to consider Section 3 of the

prescription ordinance Section 3 reads thus.

Proof of the undisturbed and uninterrupted possession

by a defendant in any action, or by those under whom he

claims, of lands or immovable property, by a title adverse

to or independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff in

such action ( that is to say a possession unaccompanied

by payment of rent or produce, or performance of service

or duty or by any other act by the possessor, from which

an acknowledgement of a right existing in another person

would fairly and naturally be inferred) for ten years

previous to the bringing of such action, shall entitle the

defendant to a decree in his favour with costs. And in

like manner, when any plaintiff shall bring his action, or

any third party shall intervene in any action for the

purpose of being quieted in his possession of lands or

other immovable property, or to prevent encroachment or

usurpation therefore, or to establish his claim in any

other manner to such land or other property, proof of

6

such undisturbed and uninterrupted possesslOn as

hereinbefore explained, by such plaintiff or intervenient,

or by those under whom he claims, shall entitle such

plaintiff or intervenient to a decree in his favour with

costs:

We have taken into consideration of the cases referred to us

in this regard viz. Thilakaratne V. Bastain 21 NLR 12.

Wickremaratne v. Perera 1986 (1) SLR 12

In Simpson V.Omenru Lebbe, 48 NLR 112 Soertsz SPJ., &

Jayethileke,J.

"As between co- owners separate possession on grounds of

convenience cannot be regarded as adverse possession for the

purpose of establishing prescriptive title."

In Abdul Majeed v. Umma Zaneera 61 NLR 361 court took

up the view that long continued possession of the property owned

in common is not sufficient to draw an assumption of ouster. It is

relevant to consider mater such as

a. Income derived from the property

I ,

I

b. The value of the property.

c. The relationship of the co-owners and where they reside

in relation to the situation of the property.

d. Document executed on the basis of exclusive

possession.

In VIew of the above authorities I am of the VIew that

Defendant - Respondents have not proved ouster and adverse title

as required by Section 3 of the Prescription Ordinance.

We note that in the case of SirqJudeen and Two Others v.

Abbas (1994) 2 SLR 365, the Supreme Court had observed thus:

"As regards to the mode of proof of prescriptive possession, mere

general statements of witnesses that the plaintiff possessed the

land in dispute for a number of years exceeding the prescriptive

period are not evidence of the uninterrupted and adverse

possession necessary to support a title by prescription. It is

necessary that the witnesses should speak to specific facts and the

question of possession has to be decided thereupon by Court".

"One of the essential elements of the plea of prescriptive

title as provided for in Section 3 of the Prescription

Ordinance is proof of possession by a title adverse to or

independent of that of the claimant or plaintiff. The

occupation of the premises must be of such character as

is incompatible with the title of the owner.

In Maria Fernando & Others v. Anthony Fernando (1997) 2

SLR 356 Court of Appeal held that:

"Long possession, payment of rates and taxes,

enjoyment of produce, filling suit without making the

adverse party a party, preparing plan and building

house on land renting it are not enough to establish

prescription among co-owners in the absence of an overt

act of ouster. A secret intention to prescribe may not

amount to ouster."

In Dias Abeysinghe v. Dias Abeysinghe & Two Others 34 CLW

69 (SC) Keuneman SPJ., & Canakaratne, J.held that:

"That, where a co-owner erects a new building on the 1 common land and remains in possession thereof for

over ten years, he does not acquire a prescriptive right

to the building and the soil on which it stands as

against the other co-owners merely by such

possession. "

In this case the Court further observed thus:

But I do not think we can decide this case on the deeds

in view of the fact that all the co-owners possessed portions of

the original land has not been established in this case that

there was an arrangement arrived by the co-owners to divide

the land in such a manner that title was to be effected, and

the difficulty is to discover anything which is the equivalent of

outer. " at page. 71.

In the above circumstances as the parties have not prayed

for a dismissal of the partition action, this Court cannot grant relief

that had not been prayed for.

In Surangi Vs. Rodrigo CALA 310/02, Amatarunga J.

held that:

We also noted in Sinnivasa Thero Vs. Sudassi Thero

63NLR 31, Martin Singho Vs. Kularatne CA 248/95

CAM18.12.96 and Dinons Appuhamy Vs. Sopinona 77 NLR

188.

In the above circumstances, the only relief that can be granted

IS to send back the case to be heard in accordance with the

requirements of the law in relation to prescriptive title. This matter

may be given priority in the original court.

Re- Trial ordered.
