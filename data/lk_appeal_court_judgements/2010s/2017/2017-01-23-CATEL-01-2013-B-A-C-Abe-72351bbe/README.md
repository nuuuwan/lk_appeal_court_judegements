the applicant or the licensee may within one month after the date of the

such refusal or revocation, as the case may be, to the Court of Appeal

which may on such appeal confirm or set aside the decision of the

Authority

The two appellants who are carrying on business in partnership under the name and style of Television

and Radio Network (hereafter referred to as TRN) has obtained a license on or about 30th May 1996

under section 28 of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act No 6 of 1982 from Hon. Minister of

Media, Tourism an Aviation (Minister in Charge of the said Act) to operate and maintain a Private

Television Broadcasting Station. The said license obtained by the TRN was produced marked P-3

before this court.

4

The relevant provisions of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act No 6 of 1982 read as follows;

Section 28 (1) No person other than the corporation established under this Act shall maintain a

Television Broadcasting Station unless such person has obtained a license from

the Minister.

(2) The Minister may in consultation with the corporation issue to any person a

license for the establishment and maintenance of a Private Television

Broadcasting Station.

According to P-3, the said license the Petitioners were authorized to, "operate and maintain a Private

Television Broadcasting Station including Cable and Pay Television transmitting" subject to the terms

and conditions in the said license.

As revealed before this court, there are two licensing regimes which are relevant for the operation of a

Television Broadcasting Network and among them the 1st is the license obtained under section 28 (1) of

the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Act. The said license permits the establishment and maintenance of the

Private Television Broadcasting Station.

The Private Television Broadcasting Station set up under the above provision will need to obtain a

radio frequency spectrum in order telecast the programs and the said radio frequency spectrum will be

given to the licensed Private Television Broadcasting Station by the Telecommunication Regulatory

Commission Sri Lanka, (here on after referred to as TRCSL) under the provisions referred to above in

the Telecommunication Act. Under the provisions of the Telecommunication Act the 1st Respondent

TRCSL is the Sole Authority to manage Radio frequency spectrums in Sri Lanka.

Section 10 (1) of the said Act which refers to the powers of the TRCSL reads thus,

Section 10 (1) The Authority shall be the sole lawful body in Sri Lanka to manage and control

the use of the Radio Frequency Spectrum and incidental and restricted

; j I I

emissions, matters relating to the stationary satellite orbit and shall have the

power where it deems necessary to withdraw or suspend its use or prohibit any

such emission.

In other words, without a radio frequency spectrum given by the TRCSL a Television Broadcasting

Station will not able to telecast their programs.

When the Petitioners received the license from the Minister to operate a Private Television

Broadcasting Station including a Cable and Pay Television transmitting, in May 1996, they have taken

steps to import necessary communication equipment in the years 2003-2004 and obtained a

Broadcasting license under section 22 of the Telecommunication Act which was valid from 01.11.2004

- 31.10.2005 for the first time, subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the TRCSL on payment

of a license fee and the said license to operate Radio Frequency Equipment had been renewed annually

up to the year 2011 which license was valid till 20l2.The petitioners have produced the said licenses

issued by the TRCSL before this court marked P-6 (a)- (t).

According to the Petitioners their broadcast was being a carried from 21A Floor of the Ocean View

Building at Station Road, Bambalapitiya Colombo 04 under the name and style of Television and Radio

Network from its inception and on 26th May 2012 officers from the Criminal Investigations Department

who arrived at the said premises of the Ocean View Building without any prior notice had sealed the

said premises and left leaving a police officer to guard said premisses while the transmission was on.

On 28th May the said CID officers had visited along with some officers from TRCSL and disconnected

the power supply of the TRN's broadcast station shutting down the operation of the Petitioners

Television Network, which was carried out by the Petitioners on valid licenses obtained under the

provisions of the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act and the Telecommunications Act.

6

As submitted by the Petitioners, they subsequently learnt of a complaint made by one Anupriya Nanda

Ruwanpitiya Technical Investigation Officer of TRCSL to the Criminal Investigations Department,

(here in after referred to as CID) stating that a television broadcast was being carried out at 21A and

19B Floor of the Ocean View Building without a license issued by TRCSL and violating the condition

of the license issued by TRCSL not naming the suspect party, but the Petitioners took up the position

that, the TRCSL had never informed the Petitioners of any breach of the conditions in the license issued

to them.

However when the Magistrate's Court case was called on 01.06.2012, CID moved to withdraw from

the case and made an application to handover the investigation directly to the TRCSL. This was

initially permitted by the Magistrate and permitted the TRCSL to continue its investigations. Even at

that stage TRN was not even named or summoned to court but the operation of the Television Network

was shut down due to the Act of the CID and the TRCSL.

As revealed before this court, the 1st Petitioner who went before the Magistrate's Court on 01.06.2012

made an application to restore the disrupted television bwadcast.

TRCSL had filed its first report before the Magistrate's Court on 08.06.2012 after they were permitted

to carry out investigations on 01.06.2012 making the following allegation against the TRN.

a) That the TRN has been broadcasting in Colombo by using UHF channel frequency No 49

without a license and UHF channel frequency No 49 is not allocated to the TRN which is an

offence under section 22 (1) of the Telecommunications Act.

b) That the TRN was transmitting digital telecast by using UHF channel 48 and channel 51 while

TRN is licensed to do an analogue transmission violating the License conditions TRC alleged

that this too is an offence under section 22(2) and 22 (3) of the Telecommunications Act.

1I

I I [ r

C) That the action of TRN is highly detrimental to the national policy planning which is now been

carried out in implementation of digital television technology in future.

However on hearing the case for both parties by the Magistrate on 08.06.2012, on 12.06.2012, made

order restoring the disrupted television service of TRN.

In the said order the Learned Magistrate whilst ordering the CID to restore the case to its original

condition has further observed that the TRCSL can act under the provisions of the Telecommunications

Act with regard to the violation they complaint of.

In the meantime the 151 Respondent issued the letter dated 8th June 2012 which was produced marked P-

14 under the heading "Violation of Broadcast Station License (T V)" calling for explanation on the

following charges against TRN.

1. Operating a digital transmission and not analogue transmission as

specified in the license.

ii. Using UHF channel 49 which was not assigned to the TRN.

iii. Operating a pay television transmission

When compared the complaint lodged by TRCSL at CID and the subsequent show cause letter issued to

the TRN it is observed by this court, that the complaint, made against the Petitioners by the TRCSL are

almost identical and with regard to this position the lSI Respondent TRCSL had placed the following

material before us.

On complaint, received from authorities (specially from national intelligence) that certain digital

transmission have been observed on UHF channel 48 and 51 the commission conducted monitoring of

frequencies and found out, that digital transmission have been transmitted by Television and Radio

Network (commonly known as TRN) and analogue transmission as permitted in the license. A part

from the illegal and unlawful digital transmission, the TRCSL had intercepted that the Petitioner had

8

also engaged in using channel 49 which was never assign to the appellant and also had engaged in

commissioning and operating a Pay TV transmission.

As submitted above, TRCSL was well aware that the 2nd Petitioner was operating a digital

Transmission from its transmitting center at 21A Floor of the Ocean View Building but in their

complaint to CID they have refrain from naming the person who is responsible for the said operation

but complained that a digital transmission is carried out from 21A and 19 B Floors of the Ocean View

Building.

However when the explanation was called from the Petitioners on the allegations referred to above,

Petitioners sought for the appointment of an independent inquirer prior to any decision and/or action is

taken with regards to the alleged violations of the license conditions.

During the same time Petitioners went before the Court of Appeal and a writ application was filed

before the Court of Appeal [CNWrit/329/12] seeking inter alia,

b) Issue a writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent from in any way or manner cancelling

and/or suspending the licenses granted to the Petitioners and/or Television and Radio Network,

under in terms of Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation Act marked P3;

c) Issue a writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent from in any way or manner cancelling

and/or suspending the licenses granted to the Petitioners and/or Television and Radio Network,

under in terms of Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation Act marked P2;

d) Issue a writ of Prohibition preventing the 1st Respondent from in any way or manner cancelling

and/or suspending the licenses granted to the Petitioners and/or Television and Radio Network,

under in terms of Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act marked P12;

e) Issue a writ of Certiorari quashing the decision of the 1st Respondent to proceed with the

purported inquiry as contemplated by P14 and P17 (b);

f) Issue a writ of Prohibition restraining and the lSI and 2nd Respondents from proceeding with the

purported inquiry contemplated by P14 and P 17 (b);

Even though the parties were summoned for an inquiry by the investigating officer appointed by the

TRCSL to inquire into the allegations against the 2nd Petitioner the only proceedings of the said inquiry

is limited to the document produced marked R I (26) which referred to as follows;

"August 10th 2012,

The inquiry commenced at 2.00 pm. I informed Mr. B.A.C Abeywardena-Managing Director

Television and Radio Network No 68, Attadiya Road, Ratmalana to submit his views in writing in

respect of the letter dated 08th June 2012 bearing No. TRC/SM/BT/0013/96/UHF on violation of

Broadcast Station License (TV) bearing No. BT -0004691 addressed to Mr. B.A.C Abeywardena by the

Director General of TRCSL.

Further I instructed Mr. B.A.C Abeywardena to submit his views in writing within two weeks time.

Subsequently Mr. Abeywardena requested further one week time for him to send his views in writing.

Similarly I informed the representatives from TRCSL to make their views in writing in respect of the

inquiry on violation of Broadcast Station License (TV) bearing No.BT-0004691. Further I have

instructed Mr. Abeywardena to submit his Witten Submissions in respect of the letter dated 81h June

2012 bearing No. TRC/SM/BT/0013/96/UHF on violation of Broadcast License bearing No.

BT -0004691 addressed to Mr. B.A.C Abeywardena by the Director General of TRCSL.

(Written Submissions are expected on or before 31 sl August 2012)

A letter said to have send by the inquirer requesting the parties to file Written Submission as agreed

before him was produced by the Petitioners marked P- 18 (b) and took up the position that, the

Petitioners have requested a copy of the Written Submissions filed by the TRCSL for the Petitioners to

t j I

I ;

~

10

reply the allegations against them, in the absence of any knowledge with regard to the nature of the

complaint made against them.

However it was the position taken up by the 151 Respondent that in the absence of filing any Written

Submissions before the inquirer (2R), the said 2nd Respondent after sending a reminder had proceeded

with the inquiry based on the Written Submissions filed by the TRCSL and his recommendation was

submitted to the TRCSL.

On the recommendations of the 2nd Respondent the 1 SI Respondent had decided to revoke and withdraw

the license granted to the 2nd Petitioner and the said decision was communicated to the 151 Petitioner by

the 151 Respondent by letter dated 31 sl December 2012 which is produced before this court marked P-24

and thereafter by letter dated 07.01.2013 informed the 151 Petitioner the decision of the 151 Respondent

to reject the application submitted by the 2nd Petitioner for renewal of the TV Broadcasting license

bearing No.BT-0004691.

Being dissatisfied by the said decision of the lSI Respondent TRCSL, the Petitioners have filed the

present appeal before this court under section 22 (4) of the Telecommunications Act.

Even though the pleadings in CNWrit/ 329/12 was also completed, the Petitioners preferred to pursue

the present application before this court and the parties have agreed to argue the present application

without pursuing the said Writ Application.

As submitted above, the present application before us is an appeal filed under section 22 (4) of the

Telecommunications Act against a decision taken by the TRCSL under section 22 (3) of the said Act.

Section 22 (3) of the said Act provides the TRCSL to revoke and determine any license granted under

section 22 (1) of the said Act,

a) On the breach of any of the conditions and restrictions to which it is subject

b) Any default in the payment of any consideration payable

I

1

f I I I

t

\ ! i I

11

c) Failure of the license to comply with any regulations for the time being in force

As revealed before this court, the 151 Respondent had called for the explanation on three charges

referred to in P-14 but was found responsible for two charges referred as follows;

a) You have violated terms and conditions of the Broadcasting Station License (TV) by

commissioning and operating digital transmission instead of analogue transmission which you

were permitted to operate in terms of the License.

b ) You have violated the terms conditions and restrictions of the Broadcasting Station License

(TV) by using UHF Channel 49 which is not assigned to Television and Radio Network.

The Petitioners, who challenged the above decision of the TRCSL before this court, placed several

material including expert reports and argued that the recommendations of the 2nd Respondent were

biased against the Petitioners and the said recommendations were not based on scientific data

available in the case.

As observed by this court, an explanation was called from the 2nd Petitioner on three charges

including a charge of, "operating a pay television transmission" but was not found responsible for

the said charge by the 2nd Respondent.

In this regard this court is mindful of the fact that the Petitioners were granted a license by the

Minister to operate a "Private Television Broadcasting Station including a cable and pay Television

Transmitting" under section 28 (2) of the Sri Lanka Ripavahini Corporation Act.

Even though the 2nd Respondent who inquired in to the charges against the 2nd Petitioner had acted

only on the material placed before him by the TRC, we observe that the said inquirer was careful in

finding the Petitioners responsible on two charges except for the above charges which dealt with

operating a pay television network.

I I\

~ i l I I I

12

Whilst relying on the license issued by the Minister to operate a pay television network, the

Petitioners placed before this court an opinion from a former Director General of

Telecommunication Regulatory Commission, A. Maniccavasagor to the effect that, "pay television

transmission is always associated with digital broadcasting technology. The signal encryption, a

major feature in pay television transmission cannot be performed unless the video signal is

converted into a digital broadcasting fonnat" (P-27).

If the said opinion is to be accepted as correct, this court observes that the operating a pay television

channel and signal encryption under the digital broadcasting technology will work hand and hand

and it cannot be separated.

The Petitioners have further challenged the finding that the Petitioner had illegally used the VHF

Channel 49 which is not assigned to him, by submitting an opinion from the former Director

General Telecommunications A. Maniccavasagor to the effect that, "the frequency occupation for

allocated to the Petitioners 697.7SMHZ is within the frequency band used for VHF TV Channel 49

under lTV Recommendations." The Petitioners sought to negate the allegation.

As revealed before this court, the Petitioners' were not represented before the inquiry conducted by

the inquirer appointed by the TRCSL, and the decision communicated to the TRCSL had reached

based on the submissions tendered on behalf of TRCSL only. In this regard the Respondent took up

the position that the Petitioners when served with (1 show cause notice, initially requested for an

impartial inquiry to be conducted and thereafter when an independent inquirer was appointed, after

agreeing to submit written submissions before the inquirer had later avoided appearing before him

by giving various reasons.

Even though the Respondents used the tenn "after agreeing to submit written submissions" and

submitted that the Petitioners have voluntarily agreed to file written submissions, this court cannot

agree with the contention of the Respondents since the proceedings before the inquirer on 10th

13

August 2012 does not show any voluntary undertaking given by the lSI Petitioner to file written

submissions even though he had requested extra one week time to file the written submissions.

In these circumstances this court is mindful of the following observations made by Wade on the

principle of Natural Justice

"It is fundermental to fair procedure that both sides should be heard; audi alteram partem, 'hear

II

f

f the other side'. This is the more far reaching of the principles of Natural Justice, since it can \

embrace almost every question of fair procedure, or due process, and its implications can be t

worked out in great deal. It is also broad enough to include the rule against bias, since a fair

hearing must be an unbiased hearing; but in defence to the traditional dichotomy, that rule has

alread y been treated separately"

(Administrative Law H.W.R. Wade & C.F. Forsyth 10Ih Edition page 401)

As observed above, the lSI Respondent had information through intelligence and thereafter making

inquiries, was aware that the Petitioners were using digital technology at the time the complaint was

made with the CID, but the lSI Respondent decided not to name the Petitioners in their complaint with

the CID. However, when they failed in their attempt to stop the functioning of the Petitioners through

proceedings in the Magistrate's Court, a Show cause notice was issued on the Petitioners and the

Petitioners were summoned for an inquiry before the 2ad Respondent. As revealed before this court,

other than the show cause notice, no further information was available with the lSI Respondent and/or

any complaint received by the lSI Respondent and/or the investigation findings, were made available to

the Petitioners for them to get ready for the inquiry.

The manner in which the 2nd Respondent directed the Petitioners to submit their written views, too

confirms that the conduct of the 2nd Respondent when holding the inquiry was against the rules of

Natural Justice.

14

In the case of Ridge V. Baldvin (1964) AC 40 at page 79 Lord Reid after discussing at length the

conduct of watch committee when dismissing the appellant, had observed,

"So I would hold that power of dismissal In the Act of 1882 could not then have been

exercised and cannot now be exercised until the watch committee have informed the

constable of the grounds on which they propose to proceed and have given him a proper

opportunity to present his case in defence.

Next comes the question whether the Respondents' failure to follow the rules of Natural Justice

on March 7 was made good by the meeting on March 18. I do not doubt that if an officer or

body realizes that it has acted hastily and reconsider the whole matter afresh, after

affording to the person affected a proper opportunity to present his case then its later

decision will be valid" (emphasis added)

In the case of 0' Reilly V, Mackman /1983J 2 AC 237 at 276 Lord Diplock observed that "the right of

a man to be give a fair opportunity of hearing what is alleged against him and of presenting his own

case is so fundermental to any civilized legal system that it is to be presumed that parliament intend that

a failure to observe it should render null and void any decision reached in breach of this requirement."

Indian Supreme Court in the case of Canara Bank V. Debasis Das (2003) 4 SCC 557 discussed the

main features of the principles of Natural Justice as follows; "over the year by a process of judicial

interpretation two rules have been evolved as representating the principles of Natural Justice in judicial

process, including therein quasi-judicial and administrative process. They constitute the basic elements

of a fair hearing, having their roots in the innate sense of man for fair play and justice which is not the

preserve of any particular race or country but is shared in common by all men. The first rule is "nemo

judex in causa sua" or "nemo debet esse judex in propria cause sua" that is "no man shall be a judge in

his own cause". The second rule is "audi alteram partem" that is "hear the other side". A corollary has

been deduced from the above two rules and particularly the audi alteram partem, namely "qui aliquid

'

15

statuerit, parte inauditaaltera acquum licet dixerit, haud acquum fecerit" that is "he who shall decide

anything without the other side having been heard, although he may have said what is right, will not

have been what is right" or in other words, as it is now expressed "Justice should not only be done but

should manifestly be seen to be done."

When considering the material revealed before us, it is clear that the I st and 2nd Respondents have

violated the rules of Natural Justice by not affording a fair opportunity to the Petitioners to present their

case at the inquiry. In these circumstances we decide to allow the appeal preferred by the Petitioners

under the provisions in section 22 (4) of the Telecommunications Act and set aside the decision of the

15t Respondent communicated to the 1" Petitioner by letter dated 31 st December 2012 produced marked

P-24.

The appeal is thus allowed and the impugned decision is set aside.
