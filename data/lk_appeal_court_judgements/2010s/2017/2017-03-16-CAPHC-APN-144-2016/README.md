Section 431 of the Criminal Procedure Act as per order dated

When this matter came up for support the 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 12th """ ,

13th and the 10th Respondents and the 14th ,pt and 2nd Respondents

raised a preliminary objection as to the maintainability of this revision

application. The intervenient-Petitioners filed this revision application

to amend or quash the order of the Learned High Court Judge of

Colombo dated 22/7/2016 in case No. HC(Rev)76/16 wherein the

Learned High Court Judge ordered the Learned Chief Magistrate of

Colombo to hold an inquiry under section 431 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure in respect of each and every elephant in question in the case

No. B 23073115.

Written submissions of all parties has been tendered to court and has

been filed of record. We have considered same. First and foremost the

Respondents has objected that the Intervenient-Petitioners has no

Locus Standi to make this application as they were not parties to the

revision application in the High Court of Colombo and were not parties

to the action in the Magistrate Court.

When considering the Locus standi of the Intervenient-Petitioners the

Respondents had submitted that the Intervenient-Petitioners are not

parties in the case before the Chief Magistrate's Court of Colombo in

case No. B23073/15. This case has been instituted by the 1st

7

Respondent regarding the alleged illegal registration of elephants in the

Department of Wild Life Conservation. These elephants has been taken

in to the custody of the 15th Respondent by the order dated 18/05/2016

made by the Learned Chief Magistrate on a bond of Rupees Ten

Million (10,000,0001-) in terms of section 431 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure until 30108/2016 in order to allow the elephants owners to

participate upcoming traditional perahera ceremonies by order dated

18/05/2016 the Learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo affirmed the said

order and proceeded to release the elephants until 30/08/2016 to the

respective elephant owners.

The Learned Chief Magistrate raised the bond to Rupees Thirty

Million (30,000,0001-) in view of the value of an elephant. On the said

date a counsel appearing for center of Eco-cultural Studies made

submissions objecting to the releasing of elephants on 20105/2016. It

was submitted that the above submissions had been made without any

standing as they were neither parties nor any party affected by the

matter in dispute.

8

The Learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo in his order dated

20/05/2016, openly allowed any party who has an interest with regard

to the rights of animals to appear and make submissions in the case No.

B23073/15. The Chief Magistrate did not make any party or a body, a

party to the aforesaid case. It was submitted that the counsel who

appeared on 20/05/2016 made submission on behalf of the Center for

Eco-cultural Studies and not on behalf of the Intervenient-Petitioners

namely, Sujeewa lasinghe and Sudarshani Fernando. Further the said

directors aforesaid for Center for Eco-cultural Studies and claimed that

they operate the said center which is a company limited by guarantee

in terms of the certificate of Incorporation marked as "q-l" to the

revision application of the Intervenient-Petitioners. However it was

submitted that the Intervenient-Petitioners have not provided any

proofldocument/evidence to show that they are in fact directors of the

said Center for Eco-cultural Studies. It was submitted that the counsel,

who appear on 20/05/2016, appeared on behalf of the Center for Eco-

cultural Studies and not on behalf of the Intervenient-Petitioners. It was

submitted that the principle of corporate legal personality, the company

and its shareholders 1 directors are two separate entitles and therefore,

!i ii IIII

Ir; f

it is the Center for Eco-cultural Studies which was represented on

20105/2016 and not the Intervenient-Petitioners.

The present application has been filed by the Intervenient-Petitioners

and not by the Center for Eco-cultural Studies. It was submitted that at

no point at the Chief Magistrate Court of Colombo, the Intervenient-

Petitioners had been represented by a counsel and that the contention

in the paragraph 21 of the revision application in which the

Intervenient-Petitioners state that they have intervened in the case

before the Chief Magistrate's Court of Colombo is false and

misleading. As such the Intervenient-Petitioners have neither standing

before the Magistrate's Court nor were they ever a party before the

court. Accordingly, there is no specific order from the Learned Chief

magistrate of Colombo allowing the Intervenient-Petitioners to make

representations in the Chief Magistrate's Court of Colombo.

Accordingly, it was submitted that the Intervenient-Petitioners are not

parties to the case No B23073115 in the Chief Magistrate's Court of

Colombo. On 26/05/2016 after having heard the submissions of the

respective parties, the Learned Judge of the High Court decided to

issue notice to the Respondents and further granted a stay order staying

10

the operation of orders of the Learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo

dated 18/05/2016 and 20105/2016.

The Learned High Court Judge of Colombo delivered his judgment

on 22/07/2016 directing the Learned Chief Magistrate of Colombo to

hold an inquiry in respect of each and every elephant in question under

section 431 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

It was admitted by the aforesaid Intervenient-Petitioners themselves

that they were not privy to the said revision application. Accordingly,

it was submitted that the Intervenient-Petitioners have no Locus Standi

to make a revision application to revise the order dated 22/07/2016 of

the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo in case No. HC(Rev) 76/16.

The Intervenient-Petitioners must show that they have a sufficient

interest in the matters to which the revision application relates to.

It is respectfully submitted that in the first place, the Intervenient-

Petitioners must show that they have locus standi to make this revision

application to this court with regard to the issue of locus standi.

In the case of Sonali Fernando Vs. AG CA(PHC) APN 144/07, His

Lordship A.W.A. Salam J, held as follows;

"In law, locus standi is generally understood to be right to bring

an action, to be heard in court, or to address the court on a

matter before it"

In the case of E.G. Roshan Fernando V. AG CA(PHC) APN 101113

His Lordship Dehideniya J, in answering the question of who has the

right to bring an action held as follows;

"Who has this right to bring an action or who has the right

to address the court? The answer is the person who was

harmed or aggrieved by the decision of the court"

In the above case, His Lordship Dehideniya J, discussed the dictum

of Lord Denning in R.V. Paddington Valuation Office (1996) 1 OB

380 at 401 on locus standi which was cited in A.R.Perera and Others

V. Central Freight Bureau of Sri Lanka and another(2006) 1 SLR 83

which reads as follows;

"The Court would not listen, of course to a mere busybody

who was interfering in things which did not concern him.

But it will listen to anyone whose interests are affected by

what has been done"

Further it was submitted that the Intervenient-Petitioners are not

aggrieved party by the order dated 22/07/2016 of the Learned High

Court Judge of Colombo. The Intervenient-Petitioners in the instant

revision application are trying to challenge an order given by the

Learned High Court Judge of Colombo in respect of criminal matter.

They were not privy to the High Court case and hence, the Intervenient-

Petitioners are not entitled to intervene and challenge an order given in

a revision application which is a criminal action in nature. It was

further submitted that only an aggrieved party can make a revision

application this position was affirmed in CA (PHC) APN 101113 which

a revision application is stemming from an order of the Learned High

Court Judge of Panadura regarding a bail application. The case of

CA(PHC)APN 101113 his Lordship Dehideniya J, stated as follows,

"Article 138(1) of the Constitution confer jurisdiction to act

in revision. The Court of Appeal Appellate Procedure Rules

specify the procedure of tendering a revision application. The

Learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that the rules do

not specify the person who is entitle to institute a revision

application. Therefore, he argued that any person can institute

a revision application. That cannot be so, because the relief can

be granted only to a person entitled to it. The person who is

entitled to bring a revision application is a IIperson aggrieved"

only"

In the present case the Hon Attorney General orl and OIC of Special

Investigation Division of CID (Petitioner-Respondents) orland the

respective elephant owners (Respondent-Respondents) are entitled to

make such an application as they can be regarded as aggrieved parties

of the order of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo.

It was submitted that the Intervenient-Petitioners cannot rely on the

doctrine of public interest litigation as the instant application is a

revision application filed by the Intervenient-Petitioners against the

order dated 22/07/2016 of the Learned High Court Judge of Colombo

and not a fundamental rights application filed in the Hon. Supreme

Court under Article 17 and 126 of the Constitution or a Writ

Application filed under Article 140 of the Constitution.

We are of the view that the aggrieved party can only make a revision

application against the order of the lower court. The Intervenient-

Petitioners cannot rely on the doctrine of public interest litigation in

the instant application, as the revision application is a discretionary

I '

I

14

remedy and not remedy available to the Intervenient-Petitioners as of

a right. Accordingly the Intervenient-Petitioners have fail to establish

that they have locus standi to maintain this revision application. Further

Intervenient-Petitioners in their petition has failed to plead exceptional

circumstances which is a pre-condition in a revision application and in

the absence of such exceptional circumstances, the revision application

should fail.

Vide Dharmarathne and Another V. Palm Paradise Cabanas Ltd

and Others (2003)3 SLR 24, the court held as follows;

1. Legal submissions in the petition do not indicate reasons why the Court

of Appeal should exercise revisionary powers.

Per Amaratunga J,

Existence of exceptional circumstances is the process by which the court

selects the cases in respect of which the extraordinary method of

rectification should be adopted. If such a selection process is not there

revisionary jurisdiction of this court will become a gateway of every

litigant to make a second appeal in the grab of a revision application or

to make an appeal in situations where the legislature has not given a

right of appeal. "

2. The practice of court is to insist in the exercise of exceptional

circumstances for the exercise of revisionary powers has taken deep

I ! ! r t I I

I I I ! i I,

t I I1

" I 1 f ,

15

root in our law and has got hardened in to a rule which should not be

lightly disturbed

3. The petitioner has not pleaded or established exceptional circumstances

warranting the exercise of revisionary powers.

In Seelawathie Vs. Agosthinu Appuhamy (2008) SLR 251, it was held

as follows;

(a) "In the absence of exceptional circumstances, the mere fact the

trial judge's order is wrong is not a ground for the exercise of the

revisionary powers of this court.

(b) When the law has granted a remedy to an aggrieved party and if

he failed to resort to the remedy given by the law, the Court of

Appeal would not entertain a revision application, unless there

are exceptional circumstances for the Court of Appeal to invoke

the revisionary jurisdiction. "

In Caderamanpulle V. Ceylon Paper sacks Ltd (2001) 3 SLR 112, it

was held as follows;

"The existence of exceptional circumstances is a precondition

for the exercise of the powers of revision and the absence of

exceptional circumstances in any given situation results in

refusal of remedies."

16

On a perusal of the record we find that this application had been filed by

the Intervenient-Appellants who were not parties to the High Court case and

is not an aggrieved party. As such we are of the view that the Intervenient-

Appellants do not have any locus standi to make this application before this

court. Further there is no exceptional circumstances pleaded in this

application of the Intervenient-Petitioners. As such we see no reason to

interfere with the Judgement of the learned High Court Judge. Hence we

dismiss this Revision Application with costs of Rs.25,OOOI-.
