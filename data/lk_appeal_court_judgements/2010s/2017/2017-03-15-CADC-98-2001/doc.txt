The Plaintiff - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiff)

instituted action in the District Court of Kalutara in case bearing No. 4602/L by

3

Plaint dated 30.05.1997 praying for inter alia a declaration of title in respect of

the land described in Schedule B to the Plaint, for an enjoining order, an interim

injunction and a permanent injunction against the 1st -3rd Defendants

restraining them from cutting down and selling trees on the corpus and from

blocking out and selling the said land, and for damages.

The 1 st - 3 rd Defendant - Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Defendants) filed Answer dated 03.07.1997 with a claim in reconvention to

inter alia dismiss the Plaint of the Plaintiff, for a decree declaring that the

corpus was owned by the 1 st - 3rd Defendants and damages. Trial commenced

on 26.03.1998 and no admissions were recorded by either party and the Plaintiff

raised 18 issues and the Defendants raised 11 issues an additional issue was

reordered subsequently.

Upon conclusion of the trial the learned District Judge pronounced judgment

dated 20.02.2001 in favour of the Plaintiff and granted the reliefs as prayed for

in the Plaint. Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Defendants preferred an

Appeal by Petition dated 12.03.2001 on the grounds inter alia that the

impugned judgment is a perfunctory judgment which gives no reasons for

arriving at a conclusion.

The case in brief for the Plaintiff is that the land described in Schedules A and B

in the Plaint was by long and prescriptive possession the property of

Paramachethiyaramaya Temple of Magalkanda, which the Plaintiff IS

purportedly the Viharadhipathi and also by virtue of certificate of quite

possession No. 1902 dated 11.03.1870 issued by the Government Agent of the

Western Province under clause 7 of Ordinance 12 of 1840.

4

The instant dispute arose when the Defendants had entered the land morefully

described in Schedule B to the Plaint and tried to cut trees planted on the land

and further when the Defendants sought to block out and sell the land.

In their answer the Defendants claimed that the land more fully described in

Schedule B to the Plaint, called and named as "Kurunduwatte Kele" which is in

extent 2A 3R 9P, was subject to a Partition action bearing No. 6138/P and lot

Nos. 1 and 2 as depicted in Plan No. 1754 dated 5th October 1918 prepared by w. Seneviratne licensed surveyor were duly partitioned as per the final decree

in the said case and consequent to instruments of conveyance marked as 1 V16,

IVI7, IVI8, IVI9, IV20, IV21, IV22, IV25, IV26, IV27, IV28 and IV29

the 15t and 2nd Defendants came to be owners of the said LotI and Lot2.

The Defendants further claimed that the said Lot Nos. 1 & 2 were subsequently

mortgaged to Peoples Bank and that there exists a rubber plantation on the said

Lots planted by the 15t and 2nd Defendants respectively. The Defendants

contented that they were entitled to the land morefully described in Schedule B

to the Plaint, called and named as "Kurunduwatte Kele" on the basis of the said

Partition action bearing No. 6138/P and I or prescription and moved for a

dismissal of the Plai4nt and countersued the Plaintiff for damages.

The Plaintiff accepted the claim that Partition action bearing No. 6138/P was

instituted in respect of "Kurunduwatte Kele" by Plaint dated 08.01.1915 and

stated that two trustees of the Paramachethiyaramaya temple of Magalkanda

were added as Added Defendants in the said case after which the said two

trustees filed a statement of claim dated 23.04.1915 wherein they claimed that

they were the duly appointed Trustees of the Magalakanda Buddhist Temple

and that the corpus was "sangeeka property" and therefore moved Court inter

alia that the corpus be allotted to the Added Defendants.

5

The Plaintiff however states that the aforesaid Trustees of the Magalakanda

Buddhist Temple acted in collusion with the panies in Partition action bearing

No. 6138/P and had withdrawn their statement of claim and as such the learned

Trial Judge had entered decree accordingly and partitioned the land called and

named as "Kurunduwatte Kele" as Lots No.1 & 2 aforementioned.

The Plaintiff contends that when the said action bearing No. 6138/P was filed in

1915 the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance was in operation and that by virtue

of Section 20 of the said Ordinance the corpus was vested in the trustees of the

temple.

Section 20 of the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance states;

'All property, movable and immovable, belonging or In anywIse

appertaining to or appropriated to the use of any temple, together with all

the issues, rents, moneys, and profits of the same, and all offerings made

for the use of such temple other than the pudgalika offerings which are

offered for the exclusive personal use of any individual bhikkhu, shall

vest in the trustee or the controlling viharadhipati for the time being of

such temple, subject, however, to any leases and other tenancies, charges,

and encumbrances already affecting any such immovable property. '

The Plaintiff argues that since the corpus is therefore a property subject to a

Trust, more specifically, a charitable trust, the final decree in case No. 6138/P is

invalid as per the provisions contained in Section 48( 1) of the Partition Act

which reads;

(1) Save as provided in subsection (5) of this section, the interlocutory

decree entered under section 26 and the final decree of partition entered

under section 36 shall, subject to the decision on any appeal which may

6

be preferred therefrom, and in the case of an interlocutory decree, subject

also to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, be good and

sufficient evidence of the title of any person as to any right, share or

interest awarded therein to him and be final and conclusive for all

purposes against all persons whomsoever, whatever right, title or interest

they have, or claim to have, to or in the land to which such decree relates

and notwithstanding any omission or defect of procedure or in the proof

of title adduced before the court or the fact that all persons concerned are

not parties to the partition action; and the right, share or interest awarded

by any such decree shall be free from all encumbrances whatsoever other

than those specified in that decree. In this subsection "omission or defect

of procedure' shall include an omission or failure-

(a) to serve summons on any party; or

(b) to substitute the heirs or legal representatives of a party who dies

pending the action or to appoint a person to represent the estate of the

deceased party for the purposes of the action; or

(c) to appoint a guardian ad litem of a party who is a minor or a person of

unsound mind.

In this subsection and in the next subsection " encumbrance" means any

mortgage, lease, usufruct, servitude, life interest, trust, or any interest

whatsoever howsoever arising except a constructive or charitable trust, a

lease at will or for a period not exceeding one month.

The crux of the Plaintiffs contention, therefore, is that since the corpus in its

entirety as described in Schedule A to the Plaint in the instant action, is

7

'sanghika property' which creates a Charitable Trust, such property cannot be

partitioned.

Counsel for the IB & 3rd Defendant cites T.B. Dissanayake and Colin de Soysa

in their seminal work "Kandyan Law Buddhist Ecclesiastical Law" in which it

states that;

"It is by a gift that a temple or any other property can become Sanghika,

and the very conception of a gift requires that there should be an offering

or dedication. Until a dedication takes place the temple remains gihi

santaka (lay property). This dedication may take the form of a writing or

may be verbal, but in either case it is a formal act, accompanied by a

solemn ceremony in the presence of four or more Bhikkus who apparently

represent Sarva Sangha or the entire Sangha. For a dedication there mist

ne a donor, a donee and a gift. There must be an assembly of four or

more Bhikkus. The property must be shown; the donor and the donee

must appear before the assembly and recite three times the formula

generally used in giving property to the Sangha with the necessary

variation according as it is a gift to one or more. Water must be poured

into the hands of the donee or his representative. In the case of a notarial

gift it must be accepted by the Bhikku. The Sangha is entitled to possess

the property from that time onwards. No property can become Sanghika

without such a ceremony. Sometimes there is a stone inscription

recording the grant or deed given. A dedication may be presumed in the

case of a temple whose origin is lost in the dim past. "

To consider whether the corpus in the instant case is "sanghika property" it is

pertinent to consider certificate No. 1902 dated 11.03.1870 issued by the

Government Agent under clause 7 of Ordinance 12 of 1840 marked as P 1. P 1

8

dated 1840, refers to the corpus as "Magalkimdepansalwarta" which translates to

'Mangalkanda Temple Land'. As such it is clear that as far back as 1870 the

corpus has been referred to as temple property and under the provisions of

Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance this Court may presume that the

preconditions of a dedication of property whereby such becomes "sanghika

property" has been satisfied especially in a case "of a temple whose origin is

lost in the dim past."

Therefore this Court finds that the corpus in its entirety as described in Schedule

A to the Plaint in the instant action is 'sanghika property'.

The Added Defendants who were parties to the Partition action bearing No.

6138/P in their statement of claim dated 23.04.1915 also claimed that the corpus

in the said case was "sanghika property" but subsequently retracted this claim.

The Plaintiff submits that this was due to collusive fraud by the duly appointed

Trustees of the Magalakanda Buddhist Temple acting together with the parties

in said Partition action. However, the Plaintiff has failed to adduce evidence of

the alleged fraud and I or reasons for such collusion.

This Court is of the view that the provisions of Section 48(1) of the Partition

Act mentioned above does not apply where the Trustees of a Charitable Trust

who participated in the Partition proceedings expressly rescind their rights over

the land to be partitioned. As the duly appointed trustees of the temple retracted

their statement of claim as Added Defendants in the said case this Court finds

that the final decree in Partition action bearing No. 6138/P is good and

sufficient evidence of the title of any person as to any right, share or interest

awarded therein to him and is final and conclusive for all purposes against all

persons whomsoever, whatever right, title or interest they have, or claim to

have, to or in the land to which such decree relates and notwithstanding any

9

omission or defect of procedure or in the proof of title adduced before the court

or the fact that all persons concerned are not parties to the partition action; and

the right, share or interest awarded by any such decree shall be free from all

encumbrances whatsoever other than those specified in that decree.

One may note that the Plaintiff and his predecessors and even the many

successors in title of the trustees of the temple had ample opportunity spanning

a period of over half a century to rectifY and I or address the alleged fraud

committed by the Added Defendants in the said partition action who were

Trustees duly appointed by the Temple, but failed to do so.

On the contrary the document marked as PI 0 attached to the Plaint, which is the

Plaint dated 16.03.1960 in case bearing No. 108 in the District Court of

Kalutara which was instituted by the then incumbent of the

Paramachethiyaramaya Temple of Magalkanda to evict the tenants on the land

called Magalkandepansalwatta (morefully described in Schedule A of the Plaint

dated 30.05.1997 of the instant case) also accepted the Partition decree in case

bearing No. 6138/P aforesaid by amending Schedule A, accordingly, to be "less

an extent of Two acres, three roods and Nine perches (A2 - R3 - P9) towards

the North of the said land which was the corpus of the Partition Action No.

6138/P District Court, Kalutara". (Vide page 19 of the Appeal brief Vol 2) This

portion has been marked as V7 by the Defendants.

At this juncture it is prudent to note that in the case of No no Hami vs. de Silva 2

SCC 114, relied by the learned Counsel for the Defendant, it was held that;

"The partition decree is conclusive against the whole world and no

ground whether fraud or otherwise can it be disturbed. The only remedy

open to a party aggrieved by a partition decree is an action for damages."

The Latin maxim Vigilantibus Et Non Dormientibus Jura Subveniunt which

means; the law assists those that are vigilant with their rights, and not those that

sleep thereupon is apt to be noted in this instance.

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff relies on the case of Marikkar Vs.

Marikkar 22 NLR 137 in which De Sampayo J stated that;

"a trust, express or constructive, will not be extinguished by a decree for

partition, but will attach to the divided portion, which on the partition

may be assigned to the trustee."

This case must be distinguished from the instant case on the facts since as per

Bertram C.J;

"The question for determination in this case relates to an alleged

constructive trust attaching to an undivided share of a land which was the

subject of a partition suit. The person beneficially interested under the

alleged trust-though himself otherwise a party to the suit-did not assert a

claim to his equitable right in the suit. Judgment was given, and a decree

entered, without any reference to the trust. The question is therefore,

whether, assuming the existence of the trust, it is extinguished by the

decree, or whether it attaches to the share allotted in severalty."

It is clear that in Partition Action No. 6138/P the Trustees were parties to the

said action but no property was allotted to the Trustees although there was a

reference to a trust and as such this Court finds that the Plaintiff is bound by the

said partition decree entered in favour of the predecessors in title of the present

Defendants.

Further, it is observed that the learned District Court Judge has answered Issue

No. 14 in the following manner;

f I I I , I I

I I I !

11

Issue No.14 - 'Is the judgment in case 6138/P a void, ineffective

judgment under Section 48(1) of the Act?'

Answer - 'does not arise'.

It is pertinent to note that the learned Trial Judge has misdirected himself in law

when answering the said issue in the aforesaid manner since the contention of

the Plaintiff is that by virtue of Section 48(1) of the Partition Act the Partition

decree in case 6138/P was ineffective. Therefore, to hold that the said issue does

not arise is contrary and inconsistent to the findings of the learned District Court

Judge.

Issue 28 which reads;

'Has the Plaintiff any title or rights to this land?'

has been answered by the learned Trial judge as ' does not arise'. This Court is

inclined to ho ld that the said issue could not have been answered in such a

manner since it is contrary and inconsistent to the findings of the learned

District Court Judge.

Similarly, it is also observed that the learned District Court Judge has failed to

appreciate and identifY the corpus by answering Issue No. 19 in the negative.

Issue No. 19 reads;

'Is the land in the second schedule a land called Kurunduwattekele?'

It is clear on a plain reading of Schedule B, which relates to the disputed land,

included in the Plaint dated 30.05.l997 that Schedule B relates to a land named

"Kurunduwattekele" and as such this Court finds that the learned Trial Judge

has erred in answering the said issue, a reference to the corpus, in the negative.

12

The learned District Court Judge has failed to answer Issue No. 20 and has

proceeded to answer Issue No. 21 as 'does not arise'. Similarly Issue No. 30 has

not been answered by the learned Trial Judge. This Court is therefore of the

view that the impugned judgment dated 20.02.2001 does not contain the

requisites of a judgment as provided for in Section 187 of the Civil Procedure

Code and as such is bad in law.

In the above circumstances and the reasons stated above this appeal is allowed.

The judgment dated 20.02.2001 is hereby set aside. The action filed by the

Plaintiff - Respondent is dismissed. Relief prayed for in prayer (b) of the

Defendant's Answer is granted. The learned District Judge is directed to enter

decree accordingly.

Appeal allowed.
