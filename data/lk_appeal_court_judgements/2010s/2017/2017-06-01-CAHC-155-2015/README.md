to the accused that he had concocted a novel story during the examination in chief to

front and back doors. The witness woke up and her children were also waked up as the

police were loud. She further stated that there was no animosity between the accused

and the deceased prior to the incident.

making a false testimony stating that the Accused had been highly intoxicated to the

extent that he was unable to change his clothes by himself in order to protect him.

9

(pg.261). The witness stated that she had not visited the police station again after she

was denied the opportunity to make a statement. She further stated that she had

attempted to speak to a senior officer and she was rejected again. The Prosecution

challenged the truthfulness of this statement.

Analysis of evidence:-

Learned counsel for the appellant submitted to court that the chain of productions was

not properly established, but he was unable to succeed. The evidence of the defence

was unable to create a reasonable doubt in the prosecution. The doctor's evidence

established that the injuries were caused by axe and the expert evidence (DNA) linked

the blood stains and the accused and without a reasonable doubt. The learned counsel

submitted that the t- shirt was introduced by the police, but failed to establish that fact

in evidence.

By citing two cases namely Queen Vs Sumanasena 66 NlR 350 and Gunawardena Vs

The Republic of Sri lanka 1981 2 SlR 15 learned counsel for the accused appellant

submitted that it was only a suspicious circumstance, but the learned DSG

demonstrated the sequence of events taken place and proved how the accused has

become responsible for the crime.

In the light of above mentioned evidence it is clear that the prosecution had proved the

guilt of the accused appellant beyond reasonable doubt and that the learned trial judge

had come to the correct finding.

It was clear from the DNA evidence that the biological material in the tested stain on the

t-shirt of the accused originated from the deceased person. Furthermore, the sniff dog

had gone to the accused's house after sniffing the axe which was used in the

commission of this crime. Every case is not proved with eyewitnesses.

It is inevitable that when there is adequate evidence, those cases are proved on

circumstantial evidence. Hence, it is evident that the guilt had been established and no

errors have been made by the learned trial judge.

Therefore, the learned trial judge had not made any errors that caused prejudice to the

accused appellant.

Considering above, 1 see no reason to interfere with the finding of the learned high

court judge. Hence the conviction and the sentence affirmed.

Appeal is hereby dismissed.
