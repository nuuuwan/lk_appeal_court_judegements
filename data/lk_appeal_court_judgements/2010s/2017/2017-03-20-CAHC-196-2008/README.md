Grounds of Appeal

(1.) The Judgement bears na date.

In terms of section 283 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, judge who heard

the case is required to sign and date the judgement in open court at the time of pronouncing it.

It is submitted by the Counsel for the Appellant that the only date that is set out in the

judgement is 25.01.2008. Which is the date appearing at the beginning of the judgement and

there is no date found at the place where the judge's signature appears. (Vide judgement at

247- 255 of the brief).

It is further submitted by the counsel that if the requirement of the law is to sign and date the

judgement in open court, the law expects the date to appear in ink or in carbon at the place

where the judge's signature appears. In the aforesaid purported judgement there is no date at

the place where the judge's signature appears either in ink or carbon or even in printed form.

(2.) The Learned Trial Judge has used his discretion not to re-summon witnesses but to act on evidence partly and substantially recorded by his predecessor.

"As the evidence pertaining to the solicitation and acceptance has been led before the Learned Trial Judge's predecessor, by choosing this course of action the Learned Trial Judge who wrote the judgement has been rendered bereft of the advantage of watching the demeanour of the witnesses who testified with regard to the solicitation and the acceptance.

Demeanour is also one of the most important yard sticks used by Courts of Law and Learned Trial Judges to ascertain whether the witness was trustworthy or not, and therefore the Learned Trial Judge has wrongly used his discretion to render himself bereft of the observations pertaining to the demeanour of witnesses PW 1, 2, 3, and 4".

In the circumstances, it is submitted by the Counsel that the Learned Trial Judge has not

properly used his discretion provided to him in terms of section 48 of the Judicature Act No. 02

of 1978, and as thereby violated section 283(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979.

f ,I I r i t I t I ! I

I I \ Thereby the Counsel submitted that the Accused-Appellant has not been afforded a fair trial

and this is a ground upon which a judgement should be vitiated or set aside.

(3.) "The indictment in this case was defective as the contract referred to in charges 1 and 3 in the indictment was not the relevant contract on which Payment was due". His submission was

that all payments to be made under the first contract had been made to the Virtual complaint

in this case when the alleged solicitation and acceptance took place. Therefore the Appellant

argues that counts 1, 2, and 3 in the indictment cannot be made.

The Respondent's position in this regard is that under section 166 of the Code of Criminal

Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979, any error in stating the offence or any ingredient as to the

offence would be material only if the accused was misled by such error or omission. The

statutory illustration (b) to the section shows that when an accused defends him and gives his

account of the transaction the court may infer that the omission to refer to the particular way

in which the offence was committed cannot be considered a material error.

After perusing the evidence of the Accused-Appellant it is evident that the availability of

evidence does not reveal that the Accused-appellant was misled. Therefore the objection

cannot be considered as a misled fact.

The counsel for the Appellant argued that the Learned Trial Judge has failed to sign the

Judgement on the date of its pronouncement and this was a mandatory requirement in law in

terms of section 283 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act.

By perusing the Judgement in this case depicts the date of Judgement very clearly typed at the

beginning of the Judgement (at page 247 of the brief) and the journal entry made by the Trial

Judge (Vide page 29) in the minute dated 25.01. 2008, clearly states that the judgement was

delivered on the 25.01.2008. The fact that soon after the judge has immediately proceeded to

sentence the Appellant also show that there was no doubt that the Judgement was pronounced

on the said date and was signed in open court.

Therefore it is amply demonstrated that the judgement was pronounced on the 25.01.2008.

(It is noted by Court that the written submissions filed by the Counsel for the Appellant has

cited a wrong date as 25.10. 2008 (Vide paragraph 04, of page 02)

Therefore the mere fact that the judgement was not dated soon after the signature was placed

does not make this judgement invalid by that omission alone.

Section 114 (d) of the Evidence Ordinance also provides that courts may presume that all

official and judicial acts are duly performed. Although the above is a rebuttable presumption a

mere statement from the bar is insufficient to prove that the judgement was not in fact

pronounced on that day. The Appellant has failed to show any such evidence that the

judgement was not delivered on the date signified at the commencement of the judgement.

In the case of Punchibanda Vs Seelawathie 19862 SLLR 414, It was held that "the fact that the journal entry stated the date of the order is sufficient compliance with the requirements of sections 279 and 283 of the code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979. Therefor the mere fact that the order has not been dated does not constitute an irregularity". Thus the Trial Judge

failure to date the judgement, soon after signing it as in the instant case cannot be considered

an irregularity. Further, the appellant has failed to show how the non-placement of the date,

after signing the judgement has prejudiced him. Therefore under these circumstances it is very

clear that submission of the counsel has no merit.

The perusal of the Prosecution Evidence in this case reveals that there were no marked

contradictions or vital omissions for the trial judge to consider discrediting the prosecution

witness. In this situation the court having considered all the evidence before it has concluded

(Vide page 251, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the brief) reveals that there was ample corroboration on

the acceptance charge. Court has also stated that on the charges of solicitation there is no

corroboration whatsoever where the sole witness's evidence is without blemish by way of

contradictions and omissions and therefor court could act even on the single witness's

testimony. In this regard The learned trial judge has followed the leading authority ,AG Vs Sunil 1999 3 SLLR 191 where gone on to point out that "where there were no marked contradictions or omissions in the Prosecution Evidence there is no basis to discredit the prosecution witness. Therefore the prosecution evidence has on its own established a case beyond a reasonable doubt against the appellant"

Furthermore, as in the case of Bharwada Bhuginbbai Hirjibhai Vs State of Gujarat 1983 AIR 753 SC 755-766 it was held that, "Over much importance cannot be given to minor discrepancies. Discrepancies which do not go to the root of the matter and shake the basic version of the witnesses, therefore, cannot be annexed with undue importance. More so, when all important "probabilities-factor" echoes in favour of the version narrated by the witnesses"

Further in State of Uttar Pradesh Vs. M.K. Anthony AIR 1985 SC 48 it was held that "while appreciating the evidence of a witness, the approach must be whether the evidence of the witness read as a whole appears to have a ring truth. Once that impression is formed, it is

undoubtedly necessary for the Court to scrutinize the evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a whole and evaluate them to find out whether it is against the general tenor of evidence given by the witness and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is shaken as to render it unworthy of belief. Minor discrepancies on trivial matters not touching the core of the case, hyper-technical approach by taking sentences torn out of context here and there from evidence, attaching importance to some technical error committed by the investigating officer going to the root of the matter would not ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole.

If the Court before whom the witness gives evidence had the opportunity to form the opinion about the general tenor of evidence given by the witness, the Appellate Court which had not this benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence by the Trial Court and unless there are reasons weighty and formidable it would not be proper to reject the evidence on the ground of minor variations or infirmities in the matters of trivial details. Even honest and truthful witnesses may differ in some detail unrelated to the main incident because power of observation, retention and reproduction differ with individuals".

The learned Trial Judge in his judgment has gone on to evaluate the defense case. (Vide page

2552 second paragraph to page 254 of the brief).Thereafter at paragraph 2 of page 254 has

rejected the defense on the basis of the defense version not passing the test of probability. The

defense evidence in its entirety was taken up before the Trial Judge who wrote this judgment

and therefore, he had the opportunity to observe the demeanor and deportment of the

Appellant. Hence the Court's finding that the defense cannot be given any credence cannot be

found fault with.

In the case of Dharmadasa Vs Director General, Commission to Investigate Allegations of

Bribery or Corruption 2003 1 SLR 64 it was held that even though the learned trial judge has

failed in his duty to consider the dock statement adequately and impartially, if no credence can

be given to the evidence of the accused, the conviction of the Accused should be affirmed.

The learned President's Counsel on behalf of the Appellant further criticizing the charges on the

indictment submitted finally, that since the 1st to 3rd count speaks of a transaction which flows from the

first contract and as all payments due on the first contract had been met by the time the acceptance

was made, these charges cannot be maintained in law.

Sec 436 of the Criminal Procedure Code states that any irregularity in the charges would not be

considered material if such irregularity has not occasioned a failure of Justice.

In Lionel Vs. OIC Meetiyagoda 1987 1 SLLR 210 it was held that "a misjoinder of charges is curable under provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure if there has been no actual or possible failure of justice. It was also held that as the misjoinder has not prejudiced the

7 IIi f I

appellants and occasioned a failure of justice, it amounts to an irregularity that is curable under Section 436 of the Code of Criminal Pracedure Act No. 15 of 1979, and the Appeal therefore fails"

Thus in the instant case where the Appellant has opted to give evidence on oath there is

nothing to show that the appellant misunderstood the charges against him and was in any way

prejudiced in presenting his defense. Therefore that such irregularity if at all is curable.

Having made extensive submissions on the evidence led, the Learned President's Counsel on

behalf of the Appellant did not complain with regard to the 4th charge on the indictment of the

acceptance of Rs 1000/- by the Appellant. As observed by the Trial Judge (Vide page 251 of the

brief) this charge was proved by corroborative evidence. In the absence of any reason to doubt

the credibility of the prosecution witnesses there is no legal basis to intervene this conviction.

It is pertinent to note that the Appellant at the time that he was giving evidence had a good

understanding of the charges framed against him. Furthermore, in his own evidence he

admitted that he was working as a technical officer attached to Warakapola Divisional

Secretariat (Vide page 216 of the brief). Therefor he has admitted that he was a public servant

during that time.Considering the above facts it is undoubtedly clear that the 04th charge on the

indictment is also proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution.

It is noted that the sentences given on each charges are legal and not excessive. Therefore,

there is no reason to interfere with the findings of the Learned High Court Judge.

Considering above, we affirm the convictions and the sentences imposed by the Learned High

Court Judge.

Hereby, the Appeal is dismissed.
