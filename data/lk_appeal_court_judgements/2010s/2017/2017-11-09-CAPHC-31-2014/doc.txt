JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

The Applicant Competent Authority - Respondent - Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Respondent) had issued a quit

notice on the Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Appellant), in terms of section 3 of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Act).

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

4

to the Magistrate's Court of Hatton seeking an order to evict the Appellant

from the land described in the schedule mentioned in the said application.

Learned Magistrate, after an inquiry, had pronounced the order dated

2013-07-29 evicting the Appellant from the said land.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant

had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court holden at

Nuwara Eliya.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge relying on the judgment in the case of

Solaimuththu Rasu V Superintendant Stafford Estate and othersl, by his

judgment dated 2014 -04-25, had held that the Provincial High Court does

not have jurisdiction to consider the said revision application in view of the

conclusions arrived at by the Supreme Court in that judgment.

The Provincial High Court, on that basis, had dismissed the said revision

application without going into its merits.

It is that judgment that the Appellant has canvassed in this appeal before

this Court.

1 2013 Sri. L. R. 25

It is appropriate to commence considering the issue at hand by re visiting

the contents of Article 154 (P) 4(b) of the Constitution. It states that a

Provincial High Court shall have jurisdiction to issue, according to law:

orders in the nature of writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, Procedendo,

Mandamus and Quo Warranto against any persons exercising within the

province, any power under:

I. Any law; or

II. Any statute made by the Provincial Council established for that

province; in respect of any matter set out in the Provincial Council

List.

It must be noted that this Article does not have any reference whatsoever

to the exercise of revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High Courts. It is

this Article that was the subject matter of discussion in the Supreme Court

in the above judgment.

The subject matter under challenge in that case was whether the Provincial

High Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari to quash a quit

notice issued under the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

6

What the Supreme Court in that judgment had held is that the jurisdiction

conferred on the Provincial High Courts under Article 154 P 4 (b) does not

extend to matters in respect of powers relating to recovery/dispossession

encroachment or alienation of state lands, since they are not found in the

Provincial Council List (List 1) to the 9th Schedule to the 13th amendment to

the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. This is

because the power conferred on the Provincial High Courts by Article 154 P

4 (b) could only be exercised 'in respect of any matter set out in the

Provincial Council List' of the Constitution. Thus, the question of law that

was settled by the Supreme Court in the said judgment is the fact that the

Provincial High Courts do not have writ jurisdiction in respect of such

matters.

Revisionary jurisdiction conferred on the Provincial High Courts is a totally

different jurisdiction which has been conferred on them by virtue of Article

154 P (3) (b) of the Constitution.

Article 154 P (3) (b) of the Constitution, states as follows;

" ... Every such High Court shall-

7

.... notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to any law,

exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in respect of convictions,

sentences and orders entered or imposed by Magistrates Courts and

Primary Courts within the Province; ... \\

Therefore it is clear that the Provincial High Courts derive its revisionary

jurisdiction from Article 154 P (3) (b) and not from Article 154 P 4 (b) of

the Constitution. Further, revisionary jurisdiction of Provincial High Court is

a jurisdiction, which is quite distinct from its writ jurisdiction.

The Supreme Court in the case of Divisional Secretary Kalutara V

Kalupahana Mestrige Jayatissa2, a judgment pronounced very recently

clearly distinguished the two types of the jurisdictions above referred to

when it stated as follows;

\\ ... At the stage of the hearing of this appeal, it was argued on behalf of

the Applicant, that the order made by the High Court was made without

jurisdiction and for that reason is bad in law. Relying on the decision of

this court in the case of, The Superintendent, Stafford Estate Vs. Solaim

uthu Rasu in S.C Appeal 21/2013 - SC minutes 17th July 2013, it was

contended on behalf of the Applicant that the Supreme Court had held,

2 SC Appeal 246,247,249 & 250/14, Decided on 2017-08-04.

8

that there is no basis to invoke the writ jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court on the subject of State Lands, as the subject does not fall within the

Provincial Council list.

I do not wish to consider this issue in the present judgment for two

reasons. Firstly, in the case referred to, the Supreme Court dealt with the

powers of the Provincial High Court under Article 154(P)(4) of the

Constitution (writ jurisdiction), whereas in the instant case the Provincial

High Court derives jurisdiction under Article 154(P)(3) (power to act in

revision). Secondly, this was not an issue on which leave was granted by

this court .... "

Thus, it is the view of this Court that the judgment in the case of

Solaimuththu Rasu V Superintendent Stafford Estate and others3, has no

application to the revision applications filed in the Provincial High Court I l t ? against the orders made by the Magistrate's Court in the applications filed

before it under section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

Therefore, the order of the Provincial High Court in this case cannot stand

as it has wrongly applied the ratio descidendi of the Supreme Court

3 SC App 21/2013 (SC Special LA 203/2012)

9

judgment in the case of Solaimuththu Rasu V Superintendent Stafford

Estate and others.4

In these circumstances, this Court holds that the Provincial High Court does

have jurisdiction to entertain the instant revision application. Thus, this

Court proceeds to set aside the said order dated 2014 -04-25 and direct

the learned Provincial High Court Judge to consider the merits of the said

application according to law.
