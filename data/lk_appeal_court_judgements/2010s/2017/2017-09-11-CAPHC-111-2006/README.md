JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for the 1st Party Petitioner Appellant and for the 2ndParty

Respondent agreed when this case came up on 2017-02-20 and also on

2017-06-21 before this Court, to rely fully on their written submissions.

They requested this Court to pronounce the judgment after considering the

written submissions they had filled and informed this court that they do not

intend to make oral submissions. Therefore this judgment would be based

on the material that have been adduced by parties in their pleadings and

written submissions.

The 1st Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the Appellant) had filed a revision application in the Provincial High

Court of Sabaragamuwa holden at Ratnapura seeking to revise two orders

dated 2003-01-06 and 2003-04-22 made by the learned Magistrate of

Ratnapura.

The said orders by the learned Magistrate pertains to the enforcement of

the final order in a case filed under the provisions of Primary Courts

Procedure Act. Indeed, it is after the Provincial High Court had affirmed

that the learned Magistrate's orders that the impugned orders had been

made.

It could be seen that the revision application filed by the 1st Respondent-

Petitioner-Appellant in the Provincial High Court does not aver any

acceptable ground for revision of the impugned orders although the

Appellant had been successful in obtaining a stay order also.

However, learned Provincial High Court Judge has correctly refused the

said revision application for want of any basis for such an application.

5 I. Despite the absence of merits for an appeal the Appellant taking the case , I further has appealed to this Court as well. Thus, all what this Court has to I say that there is no merit in this appeal. No plausible basis has been put

forward by the Appellant in his written submissions either.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal. Further

this Court makes order that the Appellant must pay a cost of Rs. 75,000/=

to the Respondents.

Appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 75,000/=.
