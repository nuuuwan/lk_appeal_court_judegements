Accused-Appellant was indicted in the High Court of Chilaw for the murder,

of a man named Amarasimghe Arachchilage Premaratne and he was convicted

after trial and sentenced to death. This appeal is from the said conviction and the

sentence. On a perusal of evidence presented before the High Court, it appears

that there had been no eye witnesses to the incident and that the accused has

2

been convicted based on the evidence of the defence. Further, it appears from the

proceedings at page 60 of the brief, that the accused-appellant was unrepresented

which offends the provisions of section 195(g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act. Further section 4(1) ( c ) of the Act No 56 of 2007 provides thus" A person

charged of a criminal offence under any written law shall be entitled to have legal

assistance assigned to him in appropriate cases where the interest of justice so

requires and without any payment by him, where he does not have sufficient

means to pay for such assistance."

In page 8 of the learned High Court Judge's judgment, we find that he has

referred to the accused-appellant's evidence and said that the accused-appellant

admitted in Court that the deceased first attacked him and thereafter he attacked

the deceased and that it amounts to a sudden fight. We find that the learned

High Court Judge has totally misdirected himself coming into that conclusion.

The Learned Senior State Counsel concedes the fact that the learned

High Court Judge has convicted the accused based on his own evidence and that

this conviction cannot stand.

The Judges presiding over original courts should bear in mind that

the basic issue in criminal evidence is to maintain two things:

(i) Burden of proof on the prosecution

(ii) Presumption of innocence on the accused.

For the aforesaid reasons, we decide to set aside the conviction and

acquit the accused.

The appeal is allowed.
