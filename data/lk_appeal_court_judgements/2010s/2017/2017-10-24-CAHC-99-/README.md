Oeepali Wijesundera J.

The accused were indicted in the High Court of Monaragala for

possession and trafficking of canabes amounting to 7 kilos and 620

grams under section 54 a (b) and 54 a (c) of Act no. 13 of 1984. They

were convicted after trial. The instant appeal is filed against the order

made on 09/06/2016 to confiscate the vehicle bearing no. 57-5886.

When this appeal was taken up in this court the learned Solicitor

Counsel raised a preliminary issue regarding the maintainability of the

appeal. He referred to section 79 (1) of the said Act and said that the

statute does not provide for a right of appeal. He further submitted that

the person who filed the appeal is not the registered owner of the said

vehicle at the time of the commission of the offence, therefore he has no

'locus Standai'.

In Martin vs Wijewardena 19892 SLR page 409 it was held that

a right of appeal is a statutory right it cannot be implied.

In view of the afore mentioned judgment and the fact that the

appellant is not the registered owner of the said vehicle as stated in

section 79 (1) of the said Act this appeal can not be maintained by the

appellant.

The learned counsel for the appellant moved to convert this appeal

to a Revision application and cited the judgment in Nissanka vs AG.

2

tIfl,f

which is not relevant to this application as the appellant in the instant case

is not the registered owner of the said vehicle.

For the afore stated reasons I decide to dismiss this appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
