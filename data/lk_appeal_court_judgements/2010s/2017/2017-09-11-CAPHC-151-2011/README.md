P Padman Surasena J

This Court observing that the parties were absent and unrepresented on

several occasions had issued notices on them at the said occasions. It is

clear from the journal entry dated 2016-09-13 that the Appellant had been

present and was represented by a counsel in court when this Court fixed

this case for argument on that date. On that date this Court had fixed the

argument of this case for 2017-02-14. On 2017-02-14, the counsel who

appeared for the Appellant had moved for a postponement on personal

grounds and then this Court had re-fixed the argument for 2017-06-28.

This Court having observed the absence of parties in Court when it was

first called in the morning kept down the case to enable the parties or any

of their representatives to make some arrangement even to appear before

this Court late in the day. However neither party was present in Court

when this Court took the case up for argument later on 2017-06-28. Thus

this Court then reserved its judgment for 2017-08-03 to enable it to

consider the merits of the case.

The Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 2nd Respondent) had filed an information in the

Magistrate's Court of Embilipitiya under section 66 (1) (a) of the Primary

Courts Procedure Act, complaining to the learned Primary Court Judge

about an existence of breach of peace between 2nd Party - Respondent-

Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) and the 1st

Party Respondent - Petitioner-Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the 1st Respondent) .

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this complaint, had

pronounced his order dated 2010-08-19, holding that the Appellant was

entitled to the possession of the land in dispute.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate, the

Respondent had filed an application for revision in the Provincial High Court

of Sabaragamuwa holden at Embilipitiya urging the Provincial High Court to

revise the order made by the learned Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, revised the order of the

learned Primary Court Judge by its judgment dated 2011-08-03. The

Provincial High Court had held that it is the Respondent who is entitled to

the possession of the said land.

It is against the said judgment of the Provincial High Court that the

Appellant has filed this appeal in this Court.

Perusal of the judgment pronounced by the learned Magistrate shows

clearly that he was misdirected in law when he had erroneously assumed

his task to be to find out as to who was in possession on the date of filing

the information in Court.

Thus, the learned High Court Judge had correctly revised the impugned

order made by the learned Magistrate. It is to be noted that this Court has

no difficulty at all to agree with the reasoning given by the learned High

Court Judge when he proceeded to revise the said order of the learned

Magistrate. The evidence, the learned High Court Judge had referred to,

are vital to decide this case correctly and the learned Magistrate

unfortunately had overlooked them.

For the aforesaid reasons this Court is of the view that the learned High

Court Judge was correct when he held that it is the Respondent who is

entitled to the possession of this land. Thus, we see no merit in this

appeal.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to affirm the judgment dated

2011-08-03 made by the learned Provincial High Court Judge and proceed

to dismiss this appeal. Further this Court makes order that the 1st

Respondent is entitled to costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
