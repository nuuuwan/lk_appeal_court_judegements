JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Complainant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the Respondent) had issued a quit notice on the Respondent

- Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant), in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act . .

to the Magistrate's Court of Nuwara Eliya seeking an order to evict the

Appellant from the land described in the schedule to the said application.

4

Learned Magistrate after an inquiry had pronounced the order dated 2010-

10-28 evicting the Appellant from the said land on the basis that he had

failed to produce a permit or due authority to remain in the said land.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Magistrate, the Appellant

had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of Central

Province holden in Nuwara Eliya seeking a revision of the order of the

learned Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court after the conclusion of the argument, had

pronounced its judgment dated 2011 -05-25, holding that there is no basis

to deviate from the conclusions arrived at by the learned Magistrate. The

Provincial High Court on that basis had proceeded to dismiss the said

revision application.

It is that judgment that the Appellant is canvassing in this appeal before

this Court.

Section 9 of the Act which has specified the scope of the inquiry states that

the person on whom summons under section 6 has been served shall not

be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under

section 5 except that such person may establish that he is in possession or

J IIII I f

occupation of the said premises upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law and that

such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid.

This Court in the case of Muhandiram V Chairman, Janatha Estate

Development Board1 had held that in an inquiry under State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, the onus is on the person summoned to

establish the basis of his possession or occupation.

The only basis such person could be permitted to possess or occupy such

land would be upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or

authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid2

This Court had further held in that case3 that if the above burden is not

discharged, the only option available for the Magistrate would be to make

an order of eviction.

In the instant case, it is clear upon consideration of the material adduced

before this Court, that the Appellant has failed to establish that he is in

possession or occupation of the said land upon any written authority of the

state granted in accordance with any written law and that such authority is

in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid as required by

section 9 of the Act.

This Court now proceeds to ascertain whether indeed there is a valid order

of Court which has previously adjudicated the impugned issue before it.

Although there had been a similar application to the Magistrate's Court

under the same provision of the Act, it is clear that the issue whether the

Respondent is in possession or occupation of the said premises upon a

valid permit or other written authority of the state granted in accordance

with any written law and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalid4 remains an issue which has not

been adjudicated "by any Court up until now. The said application had been

refused for technical reason and not because the Appellant had produced

valid documents to justify his possession. Further, one must not lose site of

4 The only scope of the inquiry of such proceedings under section 9 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

7

the fact that the Act requires the establishment of the continuity of the

valid permit or other written authority referred to above. This is manifest

by the phrase " ... and that such permit or authority is in force and not

revoked or otherwise rendered invalids ... ". Such a position may change

with time and would not be static. Therefore, it stands to reason that the

question whether one is authorized to occupy a state land must be

assessed as at a given time.

Thus, the existence of a previous order by the Magistrate's Court refusing a

similar application under the provisions of the Act, cannot operate as res

judicata against the institution and proceedings of the instant case.

Therefore, there is no merit in the submission made on behalf of the

Appellant regarding the application of the principle of res judicata to these

proceedings.

The Respondent has failed to establish that he is in possession or

occupation of the said premises upon any written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and that such authority is in

5 The only scope of the inquiry of such proceedings under section 9 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act.

force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid as required by section

9 of the Act.

Upon consideration of the material adduced in this case this Court is unable

to see any basis to assail the orders of the lower Courts.

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to

dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
