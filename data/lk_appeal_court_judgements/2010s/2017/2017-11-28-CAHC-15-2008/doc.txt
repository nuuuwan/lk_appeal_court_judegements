The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of

Anuradhapura under section 296 of the Penal Code for the murder of one

B.A. Karunasena. The second accused was indicted for aiding and abating

the first accused to commit the offence described in the first charge. The

second accused was acquitted after trial and the first accused was

convicted for murder and sentenced to death.

The prosecution witness number 5 Gunadasa who has seen the

dead body first in a mash near a lake and has informed the Grama Sevaka

and thereafter informed the police. He has testified that he saw trail marks

from the appellant's house to the place where the dead body was found.

The police officer who conducted investigations also had observed these

trail marks. He has observed blood stains in the compound of the

accused's house and also on the door.

Prosecution witness number 2 Waduge has gone with the appellant

to dig for worms to go fishing. According to his testimony the appellant had

carried a mammoty and told him some time later the following words "@@C55

coo a~ ej!)@e)" .We find that this amounts to a confession under sec.

17 (2) of the Evidence Ordinance. Although this amounts to a confession

the learned counsel for the appellant argued that after hearing this he has

neither made a complaint nor made inquiries but has gone to his uncle's

place (vide page 38 of the brief). It was revealed in cross examination that

he was arrested by the police as a suspect and he was assaulted whilst in

police custody. However on being questioned by the learned High Court

Judge he has admitted that he told the truth to court. Therefore we see no

reason to reject the aforementioned confession.

Prosecution witness number 1 Gunaratne testified that on or about

26th or 27th of March 1996 he met the deceased Karunasena at his brother

in law Gunadasa's house around 10 o'clock in the morning. After

consuming alcohol with them he has again come at 3 o'clock to the said

house and gone to the appellant's house with Karunasena to consume

liquor. Whilst the appellant and deceased were consuming liquor he has

left for home around six in the evening. The deceased was last seen with

the appellant by this witness. The following day he has got to know that

Karunasena has been murdered, and he has gone to the appellant's house

and seen the blood stains mentioned by the other witness.

..

The grounds of appeal argued by the appellant's learned counsel

were that the learned High Court Judge failed to consider that the

prosecution failed to prove the charge against the appellant beyond

reasonable doubt, this we have dealt with above. The next ground of

appeal, absence of 'mens rea' fails when medical evidence is considered.

Injury number one is described as a 'cut wound 3" x 1/2" lying oblique on

right side of head' and injury number four 'deep cut wound with underlying

bone 1 Y:z" x Y:z" is situated on the left side of the head', these two injuries

show the murderous intension of the appellant. Therefore the second

ground too fails.

The third ground of appeal is that the learned High Court Judge

failed to evaluate the credibility and biasness of the lay witnesses. This we

find is not correct when prosecution witnesses were testifying the defence

has not suggested that they had any animosity towards the appellant to

implicate him. We find that the learned High Court Judge has evaluated

the evidence of all the witnesses applying the several tests. Therefore

above ground of appeal too fails.

Evidence reveals that the appellant has been an 'Ande' cultivator of

the deceased untill the last crop and that he owed some money to the

appellant from the previous crop. When one considers the subsequent

'0 '", . " ~_"_~~'.i__"",.~,' ,_",,~J~~'u. __ .-'''''''~-' ....

conduct of the appel/ant there is evidence to say that he tried to conceal

the body of the deceased. Police took ten days to arrest the appellant and

there is a section 27(1) recovery where the police found a knife hidden in

the toilet of the accused.

We find that this is a text book case on circumstantial evidence

which points to the guilt of the accused and no one else.

For the afore stated reasons we decide to affirm the judgment dated

12.02.2008 and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
