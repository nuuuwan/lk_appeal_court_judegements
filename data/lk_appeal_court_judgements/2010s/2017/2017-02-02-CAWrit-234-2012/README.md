xiii. 23rd Petitioner - Blacksmith

xiv. 24th Petitioner - Mason.

The 1st - 13th Respondents are the chairman and the other members of the

National Salaries and Carder Commission. In this proceedings the

Petitioners seek to challenge the failure on the part of anyone or more of

the RespoJ1dents to place them at the respective salary scales which the

Petitioners claim they are entitled to be placed at. The basis put forward by

the Petitioners for this move is that most of them possess vocational

training certificates pertaining to the duties of the posts held by them.

It is on this footing that the Petitioners have prayed inter alia from this

Court,

a) a writ of Certiorari to quash the part of the decision reflected in P

12(a) and/or P 12(b) and/or P 19 and/or P 24(b) and/or any

other document/s incidental thereto to place the Petitioners at the

PL salary codes/scales;

b) a writ of Certiorari to quash the part of the decision reflected in P

22(b), to place the new recruits at MT salary codes/ scales without

placing the Petitioners;

7

c) a writ of Mandamus to direct anyone or more of the Respondents to

absorb the Petitioners and/or officers similarly circumstanced within

the 15th Respondent Council to Management Assistant (Technical)

level reflected in P 11 and/or P 22(b) or any other incidental

document with effect from 2006 - 01 - 01 or from a date

determined by court;

d) a writ of Mandamus to direct anyone or more of the Respondents to

place the Petitioners and/ or officers similarly circumstanced within

the 15th Respondent Council at an appropriate salary code/s or

scale/s within MT salary code/scale reflected in P 11 and/or any

other document incidental thereto with effect from 2006 - 01 - 01 or

from a date as determined by Court and grant them the salary

increments incidental thereto;

e) a writ of Mandamus to direct anyone or more of the Respondents to

implement the decision/s contained in the report, which is reflected

in P 26(j) and referred to in paragraph 26(e) of the Petition and

place the Petitioners at MT salary code/scale.

The Petitio[lers claim that they should fall under the definition of

Management Assistants (under Secondary Grade) of the circular P 11, as

most of them possess vocational training certificates.

At this stage it is relevant and appropriate to consider the definitions given

to various levels formulated by this circular. These definitions are found in

Annexure II of the circular which is as follows;

3. Definitions

3.1 Primary Level; (Unskilled - Semi-skilled - Skilled)

Employees performing the basic functions that facilitate the

implementation/carrying out of activities of the government institutions at

the Primary level are brought under the broad category of Primary Level

Employees. Functions such as cleaning, lighting, transporting, operating of

communicatory systems etc. required for the operational! administrative/

11

executive grades to perform their duties are described under this category

of employees. This category is further divided into 3 sub-categories,

namely, un-skilled, semi-skilled and skilled.

3.1.1 Un-skilled

This is the category of employees, who are not required to possess any

vocational training or tradesmanship of any nature in performing their

duties as -an entry qualification in their case. Seniority/experience only are

taken in to account for the purpose of promotion but not any Vocational

skills. The minimum basic educational qualification for this category is 8th

std/Gr. or Year 9.

3.1.2 Semi-skilled

Employees who are required to possess educational qualifications stated

under the category of un-skilled above and skills / tradesmanship /

Vocational training of any defined nature proven at a practical test but

who have not acquired a relevant certificate awarded by an authorized

institution are listed under the category of Semi - skilled employees. These

employees can be promoted to the category of skilled employees once

12

they acquire the qualifications defined as necessary under a promotional

scheme.

3.1.3 Skilled

Employees, who possess the educational qualifications stated under the

category of Un-skilled above and skills / tradesmanship / vocational

training leading to a certificate or license awarded by an authorised

institution /person as an entry qualification, are listed under the category

of skilled employees.

3.2 Management Assistants (Non-Technical I Technical)

Management. Assist~nts are tHe employees who facilitate and assist the

administrative, managerial and executive grades in the discharge of their

duties. Their entry qualifications differ in keeping with the duties assigned

to them. This category is further divided into 2 Sub -categories, namely

Non - Technical and Technical.

Management Assistants in charge of supervisory functions are brought

under a separate category titled "Supervisory Management Assistants".

13

When one considers the posts held by the Petitioners which have been set

out earlier in this judgment, it is clear that they cannot be brought under

the Secondary Grade as their posts cannot be categorized under that

Grade in keeping with the definitions assigned to it.

Therefore, there appears to be no basis or justification to place the

Petitioners at the next higher level namely under the category of

Management Assistants as has been suggested by them.

Further, the letter produced marked P 21 is just a proposal, the employer

of the Petitioners had made to the Salaries and Cadre Commission. It is

understandable that the Salaries and Cadre Commission has a duty to look

at it as a whole and in comparison to the other public officers. It is not

justifiable for this Court to compel the Salaries and Cadre Commission to

implement the said proposal merely because it was made by the

employers of the Petitioners.

14

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons we see no merit in

this application.

Therefore we decide to dismiss this application. However we make no

order for costs.

Application dismissed without costs.
