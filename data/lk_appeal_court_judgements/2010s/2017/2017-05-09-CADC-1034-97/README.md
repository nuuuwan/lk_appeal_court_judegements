This appeal is against a District Court Judgment dated 1997/09/04

delivered in a partition action. The Appellant is the 4th Defendant in the

original Court. The appellant and all the other parties including the

plaintiff are siblings.

According to the petition of appeal filed by the 4th

defendant! Appellant, she challenges District Court judgment only on

the ground that the building depicted as item No.2 in the survey plan

"X" has not been allotted to her but to the plaintiff.

In addition to the aforesaid ground of appeal, the Appellant's

written submission filed in this Court, she challenges the judgment of

the District Court Judge on the ground of her prescriptive title as well.

According to the devolution of shares stated in the plaint, plaintiff

claim 7112 share of the property and 1112 share to each of the 1 st to 5th

Defendants. At the beginning of the trial, all the parties have admitted

the identity of the corpus and the devolution of shares stated in the

plaint. Therefore the contention before this Court by the 4 th

Defendant! Appellant on the ground of prescriptive title should

necessarily fail as she has already admitted the devolution of shares by

admission No.2.

Therefore the only matter to be decided by this Court in this

Appeal is to see whether the learned trial Judge has misdirected himself

in granting the premises No.2 in the survey plan marked "X" to the

plaintiff, but not to the Appellant.

Only the plaintiff and the 4th Defendant have given evidence in

the trial. 4th Defendant in her statement of claim for number of

plantations in the corpus. Plaintiff has admitted in evidence that the 4th

defendant is in possession in the corpus for the last couple of decades

and for that reason he has consented to give number of plantations to the

4th Defendants, to which other defendants have not objected. The real

contention between the plaintiff and the 4th Defendant is with regard to

premises No.2 in the survey plan marked "X".

Plaintiff in evidence stated that the building in item No.2 was built

by his mother and transferred to him by deed marked " P7". Plaintiff

and all the others have got equal shares from the Deed of transfer

marked as " P7", executed by their mother. In the said Deed, there is a

specific reference to say that "the masonry built eleven cubits tiled

house" is to the plaintiff while the land is transferred to all the six

parties in this case in equal shares.

The contention of the 4th Defendant in evidence that premises

No.2 was built by her husband and for that reason the said premises

should be allocated to her.

In the surveyor report relate to survey plan marked "X". it refers

to a permanent house is being made in cement without a roof, as

Premises No.1 to which 4th Defendant has claimed. The said report

refers to a permanent house made in Woduressa with local roof- tiles as

premises No.2 which also 4th Defendant has claimed and resides.

It is undisputed from the evidence of the plaintiff and the 4th

defendant that premises in item No.2 is a permanent house made in

Waduressa with local roof-titles. According to plaintiff, the said house

has been built in around 1945 by their mother.

The 4th Defendant in her evidence has stated contrary evidence

with regard to the time period in which the said house was built. In

examination - in - chief 4th Defendant has stated that the said house was

built by her in 1945. When she gave evidence in 1996, her age was 67.

If so, she must be around 15 years of age in 1945. Therefore, the

evidence that she built the house when she was around 15 years of age is

highly improbable. Further, under cross- examination the 4th defendant

has stated that the said house was built by her husband after their

marrIage III 1967. Therefore the evidence of 4th Defendant is per se

controrary with regard to the premises in item No.2. Furthermore,

under cross-examination ( at page 87) the 4th Defendant in her answer

implied that her mother promised to give the said house to her, but the

plaintiff has got his mother to execute the Deed ( X7) in secret.

When analyzing the evidence of the plaintiff and the 4th defendant

with regard to premises identified as item No.2, the evidence of plaintiff

is more reliable. The learned trial Judge has analyzed these evidence

carefully and have come to a correct finding.

Therefore, I do not find any reason to interfere with the judgment

of the District Court dated 04/0911997. This appeal is therefore

dismissed with costs of Rs.20,0001-.
