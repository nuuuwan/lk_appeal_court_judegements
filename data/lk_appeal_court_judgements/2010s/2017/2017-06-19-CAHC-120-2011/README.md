Decided on 15.06.2017.

M.M.A. Gaffoo r,J.

Heard both counsel in support of their respective cases. Accused-appellant

was indicted on two counts. The first count for being committing House Trespass

with the intention of committing rape punishable under Section 437 of the Penal

Code and the second count for being that in the cause of the same transaction the

offence of rape was committed on Bamunu Arachchi Pathiranalage Nadawathi

which is punishable under Section 364 (1) of the Penal Code as amended by the

Act No.22 of 1995.

After the indictment was read accused pleaded not guilty and the accused-appellant

opted for a non-jury trial. The prosecution to prove the case, led the evidence of

several witnesses including Judicial Medical Officer and the Investigation Officers

evidence.

After the conclusion of the prosecution case accused opted to gIve a dock

statement denying his involvement. After the prosecution and the defense

submissions the learned High Court Judge fixed the case for judgment.

Before the judgment was delivered the learned High Court Judge amended the

indictment to be read as "Criminal Trespass" under Section 433 of the Penal Code.

After trial, the learned High Court Judge found the accused guilty of both charges

leveled against him.

The learned High Court Judge convicted and sentenced the accused to a fine of

Rs.l,OOOI- with a default term of 1 month for the 1st charge with regard to count 1

and to a term of 10 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs.5,OOOI and a

default term of 4 months for the 2nd charge. He was further ordered to pay a sum

of Rs.25,OOOI as compensation to the victim with a default term of 1 year rigorous

imprisonment with regard to count 2.

The medical evidence led at the trial lend support to the case of the prosecution.

Not a single contradiction was marked and proved by the defense. In fact, only

one question has been put to the prosecutrix by way of cross examination. The

delay on the part of the victim with regard to non disclosure of the act of rape to

the police has been sufficiently explained by her.

After amending the indictment, it was read over to the accused and he pleaded not

guilty. The accused had not opted for a fresh trial

With regard to amending the indictment there are several decided cases by the

Superior Court of this country where they have held that amending an indictment

ought to be allowed as long as such alteration cause no material prejudice to the

accused.

In the case of The King Vs. Aron Appuhamy (51NLR 358) and John Perera

Vs. Weerasinghe (53 NLR 158) it was held that amendment of a charge or

indictment should be allowed if it would have the effect of convicting the guilty or

securing the acquittal of the innocent. But it should not be allowed if it would

cause substantial injustice or prejudice to the accused.

I note that, in this case, the only alteration done was changing the count on " House

Trespass" punishable under Section 437 of the Penal Code in to "Criminal

Trespass" punishable under Section 433 of the Penal Code.

However, when this court peruses the brief this court fmds that the main offence

"offence of rape" has not been changed. The only amendment is that the incident

took place outside the house. This Court comes to the conclusion that, the

amendment made by the learned High Court Judge does not prejudice the rights of

the accused-appellant.

Counsel for the accused-appellant argued that, it is unsafe in law to find him guilty

of the charges leveled against him in the absence of independent corroboration.

When this Court peruses the case record we find that the prosecutrix story is well

corroborated by the medical Evidence led at the trial. The Judicial Medical

Officer who testified at the trial clearly states that evidence of force penetration is

present. Even when this Court peruse the Medico legal Report marked as "P 1" at

the trial, and the evidence given by the Judicial Medical Officer we note that

there are seventeen injuries on the body of the prosecutrix including neck, hip,

lumber region, breasts, forearm, palm and thighs. The counsel for the Accused had

not even attempted to cross examine and challenge the report of the Judicial

Medical Officer.

Further, Judicial Medical Officer has categorically stated that there were wounds

in her hymen that were caused 3 to 5 days ago.

According to the prosecutrix the incident happened when she went out of her

house to answer a call of nature. After the incident she explains as to why she was

6

I {

tf

t I Iunable to make a prompt statement to the police. The delay of two days also has

r I

been explained by her in her evidence.

In the case of Bandara Vs. State (2001) 2 SLR 63 it was held that" if there is

valid reason or explanation for the delay and if the trial judge is satisfied with the

I f

~ reasons and explanations given, no trial judge would apply the test of spontaneity

t and contemporaneity and reject the testimony of a witness in such circumstances." Il f Further this court takes into account that the prosecutix had been admitted to the

Uva Paranagama Hospital and has been transferred to Badulla Hospital on the 15th

She had been discharged from the hospital only on the 25th of December 2004.

Counsel for the accused- appellant takes up the position that prosecutrix had not

stated that she was raped at the 1st given opportunity. In the first complaint she

lodged with the Uva Paranagama Police on 14th December 2004 she had not stated

anything about a rape incident.

I! II

In her 2nd statement, on the 15th of December 2004, while she was admitted to Uva

Paranagama Hospital she had not stated that she was raped.

,

When perusing the brief this Court finds that, she had first revealed the incident,

when she was examined by the doctors in Badulla Hospital for the preparation of

Medico Legal Report. There she has categorically stated that she did not reveal the

incident to the police due to sheer fear and embarrassment. This court when

perusing her evidence given at the trial and the injuries on her body, her age,

marital status and social background, the omissions pertaining to her statements are

reasonably justified accepts the explanation given by her.

Considering the fact of the case this court is of the view that the prosecution had

proved its case beyond reasonable grounds. The counsel for the accused had not

challenged the evidence of the prosecutrix at the trial. Our courts have held, in

number of authorities that if evidence is not challenged it is presumed to be

accepted. In this case if the same principle is applied this court has no choice but

to accept the prosecution evidence.

The learned High Court Judge had considered the dock statement gIven by

accused, and rejected the same. When this court considers the evidence in this

case we are of the view that accused should have offered an explanation on oath as

there is over whelming evidence against him as decided by our Superior Courts.

8

r

Since accused had only stated that he is innocent, (74) this court is of the view that

the learned High Court Judge had very correctly rejected the dock statement of the

accused considering the evidence against him.

Considering the facts of this case we affirm the conviction and sentence of the

learned High Court Judge.

Appeal dismissed.
