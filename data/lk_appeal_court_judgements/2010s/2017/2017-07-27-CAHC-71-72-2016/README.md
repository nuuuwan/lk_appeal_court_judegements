The first and the fourth accused appellants along with second and

third accused were indicted in the High Court of Matara for the murder of

a man named Punam Christombuge Chandralal under Section 296 read

with Section 32 of the Penal Code. After trial first and fourth accused

appellants were convicted and sentenced to death while the second and

the third accused were convicted under Section 316 of the Penal Code.

2

This appeal was lodged by the first and the fourth accused appellants

against the conviction and the sentence.

The story of the prosecution is that on the day in question a person

who was supplying fish has come to (PW 1) Amali's house to collect

money. He had told Amali and her husband that some drunken people

were asking for fish and removed the ignition key of the van. The

witness's husband and his brother, the deceased had gone to the place

where the van was and had told these people that they had only empty

boxes and the fish is over. The said people have thrown the key on the

ground and gone towards their house.

After some time Amali had seen Lal the deceased going towards

his house which is close to the witness's house. When the deceased was

coming towards his house Amali has seen the fourth accused appellant

attacking the deceased with a rice pounder. She says that the first

accused appellant brought the said rice ponder from the house.

The learned counsel for the first accused appellant argued that

although the first accused appellant brought the said rice pounder he did

not attack the deceased with the rice ponder and therefore he should

have been convicted for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

3

He also argued that the prosecution has not established the

common murderous intention on the part of the first accused appellant on

the evidence placed before the High Court. Since this issue has not been

considered by the learned High Court Judge the first accused appellant

had not been given a fair trial. The police evidence shows that there had

been evidence of a fight.

The counsel for the second accused appellant argued that he too

sustained injuries and that he was attacked by the deceased. We find that

there is no evidence to say that the second accused appellant received

injuries. We find from the evidence placed by the prosecution that the

deceased had been unarmed and there is no evidence to suggest that

the deceased provoked the appellants.

The Judicial Medical Officer has testified that the deceased had

died due to the injury caused to his head which position corroborates the

evidence of Amali. There is no evidence to say that the appellants acted

in furtherance of a common murderous intention and there is no evidence

to say that there had been any animosity with the deceased.

The deceased was attacked with a rice pounder by the fourth

accused appellant and not by the first accused appellant although he

4

brought the said rice pounder from the house. Therefore the first accused

could not have been convicted under section 296 of the Penal Code. Only

the fourth accused who dealt the blow to the head of the deceased can

be convicted under section 296 of the Penal Code.

For the afore stated reasons I set aside the conviction of the first

accused appellant and convict him under section 297 for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder and sentence him to ten years RI. The

first accused appellant's conviction under section 296 is affirmed.

With the above variation to the sentence of the first accused

appellant. The appeal is dismissed.

I agree.
