Order

A.L. Shiran Gooncratne .I.

I-Ieard Counsel for the Petitioner for notice on the Respondent.

The Learned DSG appearing for the Respondent objected to notice being

issued.

The Counsel for the Petitioner submits that it is imperative that the

Respondent proceed in terms of Section 17 and/ or Section 38( 1) of the EPF Act

No. 15 of 1958 (as amended), before filing a certificate under Section 38(2) of the

said Aet for the recovery of default. When the Respondent is statutorily mandated

to express an opinion, that it is impracticable or inexpedient to recover monies due

under Section 17 or Section 38(1) as stated above, the Petitioner submits that the

certificates filed in the cases pending against the Petitioner's in the Magistrate' S

Courts in terms of Section 38(2) are per se illegal.

3

The Counsel for the Petitioner has taken up the aforesaid objection in the

Magistrate's Court of Mahara, case No. 85216 and the Learned Magistrate bv

~ .

order date 22 March 2017, has rejected thc application of the Petitioncr. and

thereal1er the Petitioner has informed Court that they would pay such dehlLllt in

installments.

The said order is unchallenged.

Apart from the said case, there are 10 other cases pending against the

Petitioners before the Magistrate's Courts of Mahara and Mathugama. The

Learned DSG submits that since the Petitioners are before the Magistrate's Court

in the aforesaid pending cases, the present application seeking for substantive

relief in the nature of a writ of certiorari is an abuse of judicial process. The

Counsel for the Petitioner does not dispute the fact that there are pending cases

against the Petitioner before the said Magistrate Courts.

As evident in Case No. 85216, the Petitioners have clearly submitted to the

jurisdiction of the Magistrate's Court. As such this Court will not permit the

Petitioners to make cross applications whereby the Petitioner's would be abusing

the judicial process. It is within the discretion of this Court to refuse to issue writ

if it is perseved that the Petitioner's have an adequate and appropriate remedy to

address the relief prayed for. The Petitioner"s have also not pleaded adequate

reasons as to why the Petitioners should proceed by way of judicial review without

pursuing an alternate remedy.

In the circumstance we are of the view that notice be refused.

Accordingly the Petition is dismissed without costs.

JUDGE Of THE COURT OF APPEAL

L.T.B. Dehideniya J. (PICA)

I agree.
