The Petitioner Respondent Appellant passed away while this

appeal is pending. The learned Counsel for the Appellant moved for

permission to substitute the Petitioner on behalf of the deceased to

prosecute the appeal and filed the petition and affidavit with supporting

documents marked as x 1 to x7. The Respondent Petitioner Respondent

objected to this application on the basis that the father's name appears in

the birth certificates of the children is different from the name of the

Appellant appears in the case record.

The appellant died on 20th March 2015 and his wife was

predeceased. They had' four children by the marriage namely Sarath,

Vasantha, Sisira and Hemantha. The father's name in the respective birth

certificates appear as

Lakmana Gamage Piyasena Podimahattaya,

Lakmana Gamage Piyasena alias Podimahattaya,

Lakmana Gamage Piyasena Podimahattaya, and

Lakmana Gammaddalage Piyasena Podimahattaya.

The said four children have sworn affidavits and stated that the

person referred to in different names in the said birth certificates is the

one and the same person and is the father of them. The name is only to

identify the person, but what is necessary is whether the Appellant is the

father of the persons named in the application for substitution. Even

though there are slight differences in the name of the father, the children

admit under oath that he is the father.

I overrule the objections.

I substitute the Petitioner Lakmana Gamage Hemantha in place of

the deceased Appellant under section 760A of the Civil Procedure Code.

H.C.J.Madawala J.

I agree.
