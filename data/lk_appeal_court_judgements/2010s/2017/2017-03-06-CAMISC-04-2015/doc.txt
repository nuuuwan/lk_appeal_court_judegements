Order S.Thurairaja PC J

The petitioner is a private company incorporated on the 8th November 2012 under the

Companies Act No. 07 of 2007. The Petitioner claims that the 2nd and 3rd Respondents are

foreign nationals and directors of the Petitioner's Company.

On the 28th March 2013, it was resolved by the board of directors to issue 310,000 shares to

the 5th respondent. It is further claimed that the 5th respondent had paid Rs. 3,100,000 to

the petitioner. The petitioner submits that they have fulfilled all necessary requirements

and followed normal procedures.

The petitioner claims that its Company secretary who is the 5th respondents had informed to

the 1st respondent Registrar of companies to transfer the shares to 2nd and 3rd respondents

it appears it was communications in on the 5th April 2013.

On the 15th October 2014, the petitioners had written to the 1st respondent that names of

transferee are incorrect in the form 6 and to rectify the error by entering the name of the

5th respondent. According to the petitioners the 1st respondent had informed the petitioner

on the 9th July 2015 that F6 which was filed on 5th April 2013 was already registered and it

cannot be corrected. Aggrieved with the said order the petitioner filed the Miscellaneous

Application to direct the 1st respondent to correct the erroneous entry.

Section 472 of the Companies Act No. 07 of 2007 states as follows:

(1) A person who is aggrieved by an act or decision of the Registrar may appeal to the court within fifteen working days after the date of receiving notice of the act or decision, or such further time as the court may allow. (2) The court may on an appeal made under this section, confirm, revise, modify or set aside the act or decision against which the appeal is made and make any order as the interest of justice may require. (emphasis added)

The Section is very clear on time line. It is stated as 15 working days. The petitioner had

delayed more than 1 X years to communicate with the 1st respondent for a correct the

entry.

Comparing the new Companies Act companies with the previous act, I am of the view the

new act is more systematic and regularised the activities of companies. Time is the most

important factor in the commercial world. Hence time lines must be followed strictly, if

there is a reasonable delay if it is properly explained the court can consider of extending the

timeline.

In the present application the petitioner submits that these Directors were living overseas

and they were travelling, therefore they were unable to communicate and contact.

In this modern Information Communication Technology world with all types of

communication tools and methodologies, these explanations defiantly undermine the

knowledge of any reasonable person.

Further granting such a long time period for the petitioner, will harm the efficiency of the

Companies Act and also it will open flood gate to violate the time frames stipulated in the

said Act.

Considering the Companies Act all material facts before the court, I find the petitioner does

not qualify for an order as prayed in the prayer.

Court refuses to grant any order.

Application dismissed.
