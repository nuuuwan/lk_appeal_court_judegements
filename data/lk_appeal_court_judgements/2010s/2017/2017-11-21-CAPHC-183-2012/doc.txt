JUDGMENT

Learned counsel for all the Parties when this case came up on 2017-08-29

before us, agreed to have this case disposed of by way of written

submissions, dispensing with their necessity of making oral submissions.

They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment after

considering the written submissions they would file. Therefore, this

judgment is based on the material adduced by parties in their pleadings

and the written submissions.

The Applicant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the 1st Respondent) had issued a quit notice on the Respondent -

Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant),

in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the 1st

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

to the Magistrate's Court of Bandarawela seeking an order to evict the

Appellant from the land described in the schedule to the said application.

I

5

Learned Magistrate after an inquiry had pronounced the order dated 2012-

10-02 evicting the Appellant from the said land on the basis that he had

failed to produce a permit or due authority to remain in the said land.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Magistrate, the

Appellant had filed a revision application in the Provincial High Court of Uva

Province holden at Badulla seeking a revision of the order of the learned

Magistrate.

The Provincial High Court had pronounced its order dated 2012 -12-12,

refusing to issue notices on the respondents holding that there is no basis

to fault the conclusions arrived at by the learned Magistrate. The Provincial

High Court in that order had on that basis proceeded to dismiss the said

revision application.

It is against that order that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this Court.

Section 9 of the Act sets out the scope of the inquiry to be held before the

Magistrate in following terms;

6

" ... At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has

been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in

the application under section 5 except that such person may establish that

he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid .... "

In the instant case, it is clear upon consideration of the material adduced

before this Court, that the Appellant has failed to establish that he is in

possession or occupation of the said land upon any written authority of the

state granted in accordance with any written law and that such authority is

in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid as required by

section 9 of the Act.

Perusal of the impugned order of the learned Privincial High Court Judge

does not reveal any basis upon which this Court can decide to interfere.

Further, this Court needs to remind itself that the impugned order is an

7

order made by the Provincial High Court when exercising its revisionary

jurisdiction. Therefore, there is absolutely no merit in this appeal.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with

costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
