Chaya Sri Nammuni SC for the Respondents

03.08.2017

Both Counsel were heard on their respective cases. Filing an

application for judicial review by way of a petition dated 27.08.2012, the

petitioner states that she joined the government service in 1979 and rose to the

position of an Accountant, Grade I and at the time of her retirement on

25.04.2012 she was serving as an Accountant, Grade I at the Divisional

Secretariat, Galle. Her complaint before this Court is that by a letter dated

18.04.2012 marked as 'PI', she was informed on 18.04.2012 that a disciplinary

inquiry had been begun against her and therefore she was placed on retirement

in terms of Section 12 (1) of the Minutes on Pension. This Court observes that

by 18.04.2012, no charge sheet had been issued to the petitioner and therefore

no disciplinary inquiry could have commenced against her.

2

The Court observes that 'PI' has been issued without any basis as Section

12(1) of the Minutes on Pension alludes to a pending or contemplated

disciplinary proceedings. This decision has been communicated to the

petitioner by the Divisional Secretary of the Four Gravets, Galle. In his letter

the Divisional Secretary calls in aid a letter issued by the Public Service

Commission.

This Court takes the view that a public servant could be retired

under Section 12 (1) of the Minutes on Pension only if certain conditions are

satisfied:

1) There has to be an explanation tendered by a public servant in

response to a communication made to that public servant in

respect of her negligence, irregularity or misconduct.

2) The competent authority must find that the explanation is

unsatisfactory.

These ingredients have to be satisfied before a decision is taken to

retire a public officer in terms of Section 12 (1) of the Minutes on Pension. The

only letters that are relied upon, in the statement of objections to the petition,

to justify a retirement under Section 12 of the Minutes on Pension, seem to be

3R3, 3R4, 3RS and 3R6. If one takes these letters in their chronological order,

3R6 is a recommendation to the Secretary to the Treasury as far back as

19.11.2009 to the effect that subsequent to a preliminary investigation two

officers could be proceeded against at a disciplinary inquiry. This letter dated

19.11.2009 (3R6) also attaches a proposed charge sheet against the two

officers named in this letter. One of the two officers named in this letter

happens to be the petitioner and this Court takes the view this letter could not

be taken to be a contemplation of an inquiry against the petitioner by a

competent authority. At best it remains a mere recommendation but the

precedent step of a letter calling for an explanation does not seem to have been

taken. Section 12 (1) of the Minutes on Pension is quite explicit in that it calls

for a decision by the competent authority to the effect that the explanation

tendered by a public servant is unsatisfactory. There is no evidence before this

Court that an explanation was called for from this petitioner or a finding was

reached that any explanation tendered by the petitioner was found to be

unsatisfactory. In addition this particular letter (3R6) has not been written by

the competent authority. Therefore, 3R6 cannot form the basis for a Section 12

decision.

3R4 dated 09.02.2012

This is a letter written on 09.02.2012 by the Deputy Secretary to

the Treasury, to the Secretary to the Public Service Commission. In this

communication one Mr. P.A. Abeysekera, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury

recommends that the petitioner be placed on a Section 12 retirement.

However, there is no evidence tendered to this Court to demonstrate that before

this recommendation was addressed, the competent authority found any

explanation tendered by the petitioner unsatisfactory. In the circumstances,

the Court takes the view that the letter 3R4 cannot form the basis for a Section

12 decision.

3R5 dated 13.03.20 12-1etter from the Secretary, Public Service

Commission

Neither can the letter marked 3R5 and dated 13.3.2012 form the

basis for a Section 12 order. This is a letter written by the Secretary, Public

Service Commission advising the Secretary to the Treasury to retire the

Petitioner under the provisions of Section 12 of the Minutes on Pension. It

appears that this letter does not emphasize the fact that the petitioner's

explanation if any was ever considered before the advice was tendered.

The Court finds the letter marked as 3R3 to be of no consequence

as that letter too does not satisfy the requirements necessary to place a public

officer on Section 12 retirement. The learned President's Counsel Mr.

Chrishantha Weliamuna cites the case of Wilbert Godawela vs. S.D.

Chandradasa and others (1995) 2 Sri.LR 338 where His Lordship

Amarasinghe J (with Their Lordships Mark Fernando J and Sarath N. Silva J

agreeing) has adverted to the requisites that have to be followed before a public

officer could be placed on a Section 12 (1) retirement. This judgment is quite

eloquent of the requirement that a pension could, in terms of Section 12 (1) of

the Minutes on Pension be withheld or reduced only where;

1) at the time of his retirement from public service disciplinary

proceedings were pending or contemplated, and

2) where the explanation tendered by the public servant concerned is

considered to be unsatisfactory.

This Court emphasizes the fact that before a competent authority

proceeds to visit a public servant with sanctions of this nature which impact on

5

the economic benefits that a long serving public servant may have earned at

the end of his carrier, both the aforesaid requirements that have been referred

to by the Supreme Court have to exist. In other words, the requirements of a

pending or contemplated inquiry and an unsatisfactory explanation are

conjunctive and not disjunctive. None of these two requirements were in

existence when the impugned document 'PI' dated 18.04.2012 was addressed

to the petitioner. The petition to this Court is dated 27th August 2012.

Therefore, having regard to the fact that the doctrine of ultra vires is the pillar

of administrative justice this Court has to jealously guard against abuse of

powers that have been enacted for the benefit of the citizens of this country. In

the circumstances, this Court holds that the respondents have acted ultra vires

the powers that have been vested with them in order to retire this public

servant in terms of Section 12 (1) of the Minutes on Pension. No preconditions

necessary to the exercise of the power given in Section 12 (1) of the Minutes on

Pension have existed and no attempt has been shown that such prerequisites

as are stipulated by law existed before a decision was taken to retire the

petitioner under Section 12 (1) of the Minutes on Pension.

In the circumstances, this Court proceeds to issue a writ of

certiorari quashing the document marked 'PI '. Therefore, the decision to stop

payment of pension and gratuity due to the petitioner on her retirement

effective from 25.04.2012 is quashed. Since this Court has found that the

Section 12 retirement is ultra vires the powers vested in the functionaries, this

Court holds that any further sanctions on the petitioner by way of a

disciplinary inquiry would be unwarranted in the circumstances.

The petitioner would be entitled to all the pension benefits and

gratuity. This Court also states that any disciplinary inquiry would be

unwarranted in view of the fact that there is no charge sheet that could be
