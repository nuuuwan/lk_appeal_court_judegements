This is an appeal from the District Court of Elpitiya against an order

made on a charge of Contempt of Court.

We requested the parties to address the Court on the jurisdiction at the

first instance. Though no relief was sought against the 3rd Respondent, the

Attorney General, on the request of the Court, appeared as amicus curiae.

The issue that had to be decided was whether an appeal from a District

Court on an order made on a charge of contempt of Court lies in the

Provincial High Court or the Court of Appeal.

The appellate procedure on contempt of Court is laid down in section 798

of the Civil Procedure Code which reads as;

798. An appeal shall lie to the Court of Appeal from every order,

sentence, or conviction made by any court in the exercise of its

special jurisdiction to take cognizance of, and to punish by way of

summary procedure the offence of contempt of court, and of

offences by this Ordinance made punishable as contempt of court;

and the procedure on any such appeal shall follow the procedure

laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure Act regulating

appeals from orders made in the ordinary criminal jurisdiction of

Magistrates' Courts.

This provision of law provides that the appellate jurisdiction on contempt

of Court matters to lie on the Court of Appeal. This section has to be

interpreted with the provisions contained in the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 and it's Amendment

Act No. 54 of 2006. The Article 138 of the Constitution defines the

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal as;

138. (1) The Court of Appeal shall have and exercise subject to the

provisions of the Constitution or of any law, an appellate

jurisdiction for the correction of all errors in fact or in law which

shall be committed by the High Court, in the exercise of its

appellate or original jurisdiction or by any court of First Instance,

tribunal or other institution and sole and exclusive cognizance, by

way of appeal, revision and restitutio in integrum. of all causes,

suits, actions, prosecutions, matters and things of which such High

Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution may have

taken cognizance;

Provided that no judgment, decree or order of any court shall be

reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

(2) The Court of Appeal shall also have and exercise all such

powers and jurisdiction, appellate and original, as Parliament may

by law vest or ordain.

After the 13th Amendment to the constitution, Article 154P provided to

establish the High Court of Provinces. The Article reads as;

154P

(1) There shall be a High Court for each Province with effect from

the date on which this Chapter comes into force. Each such High

Court shall be designated as the High Court of the relevant

Province.

(2) ...... .

(3) Every such High Court shall

(a) exercise according to law, the original criminal

jurisdiction of the High Court of Sri Lanka in respect of

offences committed within the Province,

(b) notwithstanding anything in Article 138 and subject to

any law, exercise, appellate and revisionary jurisdiction in

respect of convictions, sentences and orders entered or

imposed by Magistrates Courts and Primary Courts within

the Province;

(c) exercise such other jurisdiction and powers as

Parliament may, by law, provide.

(4) ..... .

Under Sub Article (b) the appellate jurisdiction in respect of convictions,

sentences, and orders entered or imposed by the Magistrate Courts or

Primary courts was vested with the High Court of the Province. Sub

Article (c) kept room for the Parliament to enact other laws to bestow

jurisdiction to the High Court of Provinces. The High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 was enacted to

regulate the procedure in the said High Courts. The preamble of the Act

says that;

An act to make provision regarding the procedure to be followed

in, and the eight to appeal to, and from, the High Court established

I

under Article 154P of the Constitution; and for matters connected

therewith or incidental thereto.

Under section 4 of the Act the appellate jurisdiction III respect of

convictions, sentences and orders of the Magistrate Courts and Primary

Courts is vested with the High Court of the Province. The section 5 reads

thus;

5- The Provisions of written law applicable to appeals to the Court

of Appeal, from convictions, sentences or orders entered or

imposed by a Magistrate's Court, and to applications made to the

Court of Appeal for revision of any such conviction, sentence or

order shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to appeals to the High Court

established by Article 154P of the Constitution for a Province,

from convictions, sentences or orders entered or imposed by

Magistrate's Courts, Primary Courts and Labour Tribunals within

that Province1 and from orders made under section 5 or section 9

of the Agrarian Services Act, No. 58 of 1979, in respect of land

situated within that Province and to applications made to such

High Court, for revision of any such conviction, sentence or order.

With the amendments made to the principal act by the Amendment Act

No. 54 of 2006, the Parliament acting under Article 154P(3)(c) of the

Constitution, the appellate jurisdiction in respect of the orders and

judgments of the District Court was also conferred with the High Court of

Provinces. New sections introduced by the amendment were inserted as

5A, 5B, 5C, and 5D immediately after section 5 of the principal act. The

new section 5A reads;

(1) A High Court established by Article 154P of the Constitution

for a Province, shall have and exercise appellate and revisionary

jurisdiction in respect of judgments, decrees and orders delivered

and made by any District Court or a Family Court within such

Province and the appellate jurisdiction for the correction of all

errors in fact or in law, which shall be committed by any such

District Court or Family Court, as the case may be.

(2) The provisions of sections 23 to 27 of the Judicature Act, No.2

of 1978 and sections 753 to 760 and sections 765 to 777 of the

Civil Procedure Code (Chapter 101) and of any written law

applicable to the exercise of the jurisdiction referred to in

subsection (1) by the Court of Appeal, shall be read and construed

as including a reference to a High Court established by Article

154P of the Constitution for a Province and any person aggrieved

by any judgment, decree or order of a District Court or a Family

Court, as the case may be, within a Province, may invoke the

jurisdiction referred to in that subsection, in the High Court

established for that Province:

Provided that no judgment or decree of a District Court or of a

Family Court, as the case may be, shall be reversed or varied by

the High Court on account of any error, defect or irregularity,

which has not prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or

occasioned a failure of justice.

In the section 798 of the Civil Procedure Code refers to the appellate

jurisdiction in respect of "order, sentence, or conviction" but the section

5A of the Act No. 54 of 2006 refers only to "judgments, decrees and

orders" of the Court. The 13th amendment to the Constitution, the High

Court of the Provinces (Special Provisions) Act No. 19 of 1990 and its

7

Amendment Act No. 54 of 2006 as of a whole intends to allow the

litigants easy access to the Appellate Procedure. Therefore, not including

the words "convictions and sentences" in the section 5A of the Act does

not exclude the jurisdiction in respect of "convictions and sentences"

imposed by the District Courts on contempt of Court matters.

The Act No. 54 of 2006 has not vested the exclusive appellate jurisdiction

with the High Court of Provinces because of the Constitutional provision

on appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. The High Court of the

Provinces and the Court of Appeal were vested with the concurrent

appellate jurisdiction.

Acting under section 5D of the High Court of Provinces (Special

Provisions) Act no 19 of 1990 as amended by Act No. 54 of 2006, I

transfer this case to the High Court of Southern Province holden at Galle

exercising Appellate Jurisdiction to hear and conclude this matter.

Parties to bear their own costs in this Court.
