Petitioner to the present application G.K. Udeni Janaka Perera had come before this court seeking

inter alia,

b) A writ of Certiorari quashing the Environmental Protection License (here in after referred to

as EPL) issued to the 4th Respondent dated 28.01.2015.

c) A writ of Mandamus directing the 5th Respondent or anyone or more Respondents to take

steps according to law against the operation of the said garage at the above captioned premises

by the 4th Respondent.

4

d) An interim order restraining the 4th Respondent from operating the business of a garage at the

above captioned premises until final determination of this application or upon terms

determined by the court.

When the present application was supported before this court on 21.08.2015, this court after

considering the material placed before the court exparte, had granted interim relief as prayed in

paragraph (d) above for a limited period.

The Respondents when appeared before this court had raised objections for the extension of the said

interim order and filed limited objection before us. The matter was thereafter taken up for inquiry into

the extension of stay order before us and in the present order we will be considering the material

placed before us by all the parties in deciding whether the interim order should be extended or not

pending final determination of this case.

The Petitioner who is a resident at No. 871/2 Rukmale Road, Kottawa, Pannipitiya had complained to

the 1st Respondent Authority for the 1st time on 14.08.2014 against the 4th Respondent, of the serious

health hazards caused by operating a bus repair garage at No. 871 Rukmale Road, Kottawa,

Pannipitiya.

On this complaint, the 1st Respondent Authority has caused a site inspection on 05.09.2014. Through

the observation of the said site inspection it was revealed, that at the time of the inspection, spray

painting in an open air area and repairing of buses were carried out in the premises in question, oil

spills/ seepage was observed in vicinity of the garage.

Consequent to the said site inspection the 4th Respondent was informed in writing that, he was

required to stop spray painting with immediate effect and that it was necessary for the 4th Respondent

to obtain an EPL form the Local Authority to continue with the garage. (P-3)

As revealed before this court, the Petitioner during the same period had lodged several complaints

with number of authorities including Police Station Kottawa, Police Office Mirihana and Department

of Local Government of the Western Provincial Council.

While investigations and inquiries are in progress, the 4th Respondent said to have obtained an

Environmental Protection License from 5th Respondent under part C of Government Gazette No

1533/16 dated 25.01.2008 which delegates the granting of an EPL to Local Authorities.

The petitioner who was dissatisfied with the said decision by the 5th Respondent to issue the 4th

Respondent with an EPL had challenged the said decision and prayed the relief as submitted above.

Even though the parties wanted the present inquiry be limited to the extension of the stay order, we

observe that,the parties have submitted comprehensive submissions which is sufficient even to decide

the main matter, but we will restrict this order only to the question of extension of stay order.

One main argument raised by the Petitioner during the inquiry was the effect of the zoning identified

in the Development Plan for the Urban Development Area of Maharagama published on 12.09.2008

for the period 2008-2020. In this regard the Petitioner had taken up the position that,

"the said license has been issued contrary to the National Environment Act No 47 of 1980 for the

reason that the said garage is situated in a Residential Area contrary to the zoning plan 2008-2020 and

as such ultra vires the powers conferred on the 5th Respondent. .. "

Whilst submitting that the garage is situated in a Residential Area identified under the Development

Plan 2008-2020, the Petitioner argued that operating a garage is not identified as a permissible user

under the said Development Plan. However, this position was disputed before us by the 4th

Respondent and submitted that the said area comes under Mixed Development Area, but the

Petitioner in support of his argument produced a letter from Provincial Director- UDA confirming

that the area in question comes within a Residential Area.

The Learned Additional Solicitor General who represented the 1st to 3rd and 8th and 9th Respondents

took up the position that the said Development plan prepared under section 8 of the Urban

Development Act No. 41 of 1978 by its very nature cannot be retrospective in operation and zoning

has to be done to be effective in the future. A garage which was in operation at the time the

development plan come in effect cannot be removed from the area but, they have to be regulated

under the provisions of the prevailing legislature. In this regard the Learned Additional Solicitor

General submitted that the National Environment Act No. 47 of 1980 and the Regulations made there

under had provided the issuance of an EPL to cover particular prescribed activities and section 23A of

the amending Act No 53 of 2000 empowered the Minister to determine what activities would require \

the environment causing pollution. \

I !

a license, being activities which involve or results in discharging, depositing or emitting waste in to

In this regard our attention was drawn to Gazette extra ordinary No. 1533/16 dated 25.01.2008 where

the Minister had made regulation under section 23A referred to above, and under part "c" vehicle

repairing or maintaining garages excluding spray painting as an activity which requires a license \

f under the said section.

After the 1st inspection by the officers of the 1st Respondent on 05.09.2014, another site inspection

was carried out by the 1st respondent on 09.12.2014 and the report prepared by the officers of the 1st

Respondent Authority was produced before us marked 1R2, where the said officials have observed an

improvement of the cleanliness and organization of the said premises and at the time the inspection

carried out, spray painting work has been stopped. The above findings were communicated to the

parties by the first Respondent by letter dated 29.12.2014. (P-14) Subsequent to the said letter by the

1 st Respondent, the 4th Respondent had applied for a EPL form the relevant Local Authority, i.e.

Maharagama Municipal Council and the said Council had issued the impugned EPL dated 28.01.2015

valid for a period of 3 years commencing from 05.12.2014 and as observed by this court, the said

7

EPL contained several conditions including prohibition on spray painting, washing of vehicles,

burning of articles, disposal of waste, and restrictions on sound pollution as well.

It was further observed by this court that another meeting was held after issuing the said EPL on

25.05.2015 at the auditorium of the Central Environmental Authority with the participation of several

public servants including officials from the Environmental Authority, Maharagama Municipal

Council and Police and at the said meeting it was proposed to the Petitioner to monitor the conduct of

the 4th Respondent by the CEA and Maharagama Municipal Council to make sure that the 4th

Respondent does not violate the conditions of the EPL. When the said proposal was made to the

Petitioner, the Petitioner did not agree for the said proposal, since the Petitioner was of the view that

the said issuance of the EPL was made ultra vires by the 5th Respondent, but, this court at this

juncture is not inclined to consider the legality of the said issuance of the EPL but is mindful of the

steps taken by the authorities referred to above, when considering the extension of the stay order as

prayed in paragraph (d) above.

In this regard this court is mindful of the three tests applied in the case of Duwearachchi V. Vincent

Perera (1984) 2 Sri LR 94 when granting interim relief to the effect,

a) Whether the final relief will be rendered nugatory

b) Where does the balance of convenience lie

c) Will irreparable harm be caused to any party'

and observed that, due to the conditions imposed in the EPL and the undertaking given by the 15t

Respondent along with the i h Respondent to monitor the conduct of the 4th Respondent, with regard

to the observance of the said conditions, will certainly in favour of the 4th Respondent when

considering the 2nd and the 3rd tests referred to above. The first test referred to above will not have

any impact on the case in hand, in the absence of direct bearing between the interim relief and the

final relief as prayed for.

For the forgoing reasons, this court is not inclined to extend the interim relief as prayed by the

Petitioner in paragraph (d) above but, we make order that, the 1st and i h Respondents to closely

monitor the conduct of the 4th Respondent with regard to the observance of the conditions imposed in

the EPL dated 28.01.2015 and submit this court with a report by the 1st Respondent in every six

months time until the final disposal of this matter or until the said EPL is in operation whichever

takes place first.
