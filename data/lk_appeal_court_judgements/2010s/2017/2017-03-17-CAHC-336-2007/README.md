The accused appellant was indicted under section 296 of the Penal Code for the

murder of a man named Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Jayantha Bandara in the High

Court of Kurunegala. He was convicted and sentenced to death on 29.10.2007.

This appeal is against the said conviction and the sentence.

The version of the prosecution is that on the day in question, the deceased was

attacked by a mammoty and succumbed to his injuries. There are no eyewitnesses

to narrate the incident and the prosecution has led circumstantial evidence.

Witnesses Rathnayake, Suraweera and Dingiri Menika whilst giving evidence have

said that the appellant has admitted that he attacked a person with a mammoty. Out

of these witnesses. Dingiri Menika has stated that she witnessed the dispute

between the Appellant and the deceased, the day before. She has also said that, the

Appellant on the day of the incident came to her house and uttered the words "I

attacked Dudly"(Page 59 of the brief)

The learned High Court Judge has inadvertently stated that all the witnesses

mentioned the name "Dudly" whereas we find that only Dingiri Menika has

referred to the deceased by his name. We find that no prejudice has been caused to

the Appellant on that conclusion.

The grounds of Appeal taken up by the learned Counsel for the Appellant were that

the High Court Judge misdirected himself on critical issues of facts and failed to

assess the testimonial trustworthiness of the witnesses.

On a perusal of the proceedings we find that the witnesses are independent

witnesses and that they did not have any reason to falsely implicate the Appellant.

The counsel for the Appellant further argued that the learned High Court Judge

misapplied the Allenborough Dictum. The learned High Court Judge has observed

that when a strong prima facie case has been established by the prosecution, the

appellant should give a plausible explanation. On a perusal of evidence, we find

that the prosecution has presented a strong prima facie case and the said finding of

the learned High Court Judge is correct.

It was held in Ajit Samarakoon Vs. The Republic 2004 2SLR at page 211 that:

"The principles laid down in R V Cochrane and R v Burdette do not place a

legal or a persuasive burden on the accused to prove his innocence or to

prove that he committed no offence but those two decisions on proof of a

prima face case on proof highly incriminating circumstances shift the

evidential burden to the Accused to explain away the highly incriminating

circumstances when he had both the power and the opportunity to do so."

The learned D.S.G appearing for the respondent argued that there is ample

evidence to show that the Appellant committed the offense while referring to page

54 of the brief. It appears from Dingiri Menika's evidence in page 53 and page 54

that there had been some incident between the Appellant and the deceased over

some monetary transaction. The learned D.S.G said that this shows the motive and

the attack was indeed premeditated and a preplanned act. She also referred to the

subsequent conduct of the Appellant, which infers guilt.

The Appellant was arrested by the Nikaweratiya Police after a lapse of 12 days

from the crime.

The learned D.S.G submitted that the defence has not challenged the medical

evidence led in the High Court. She referred to witness Jayalath's evidence and

stated that the Appellant admitted that he attacked a person twice with a mammoty.

The learned D.S.G further stated that the medical evidence is compatible in that the

findings point towards an attack by a mammoty on the deceased.

For the foregoing reasons, we are not inclined to interfere with the judgment where

this court finds that the evidence has been properly analyzed.

This court affirms the Judgment and conviction dated 22.10.2007 and dismiss the

appeal.

Appeal Dismissed.
