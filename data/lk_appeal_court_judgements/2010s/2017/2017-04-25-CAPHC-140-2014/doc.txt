This is an appeal from High Court of Colombo.

2

The Applicant Petitioner Respondent Respondent (hereinafter sometimes

called and referred to as the respondent) as an officer of the Colombo

Municipal Council filed an application in the Magistrate Court Maligakanda

seeking for an order to demolish the unauthorized construction done by the

Respondent Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called and referred

to as the Appellant). The Appellant admitted that the construction was

unauthorized and the Court allowed time to regularize or to remove the

unauthorized part of the construction. On failure to do so the Court issued

the demolition order.

The Appellant moved in revision against this order in the High Court of

Colombo without success. This appeal is from the order of the High Court.

3

The parties being agreed to dispose the argument by way of written

submissions, were directed to file the same on or before the 1 i h of March,

but none of them have filed their written submissions leaving the Court to

decide on the available material on record.

The main argument of the appellant in the petition of appeal is that the

Colombo Municipal Council does not have the authority to institute legal

action against an unauthorized construction.

Section 23(5) of the Urban Development Authority Act empowers the

Authority to delegate its powers to an officer of a local authority. The

Respondent in his application presented to the Magistrate Court has stated

that the power has been so delegated.

The appellant in the Magistrate Court admitted that the construction was

unauthorized and obtained time to regularize the same. He did not question

the authority of the Respondent to institute action. After submitting to the

jurisdiction now he cannot question the authority of the prosecutor.

I see no reason to interfere with the finding of the learned High Court Judge.

Accordingly the appeal is dismissed without costs.

I agree.
