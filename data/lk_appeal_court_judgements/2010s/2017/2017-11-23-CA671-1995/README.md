'The Plaintiff instituted this action claiming that he became entitled to the subject~

1 matter of this case, namely, a lot marked as "H" of the land called "Niyadaga

Watta" depicted in Plan No. 2377A dated 01.03.1931 made by A. Ganegoda, licensed

Surveyor which is described in 3rd paragraph to the plaint, that the Defendant on or

about 24.09.1990, without any right whatsoever entered into the subject~matter and

started to build a temporary building.

In his prayer the Plaintiff prayed:~

(l) that he be declared entitled to the land described in the schedule to the

plaint;

(2) ejectment of the Defendant and those who claim under him to be ejected

therefrom and to give vacant possession thereof;

(3) an injunction be issued preventing the Defendant from constructing the

building.

The Defendant filed answer stating that the building mentioned in paragraph 3 of the

plaint and bearing assessment No. 344 belonged to him by prescriptive possession

acquired by himself and his predecessors. The Defendant further states that his

parents were in occupation of the hut which was in existence earlier and that he was

born in that hut and he has had 64 years of possession of the same.

2

At the trial the title of the Plaintiff has been established and the Defendant has not

adduced any evidence against the proof of title of the Plaintiff.

The Defendant has also given evidence stating that there was a tea kiosk in the

subject-matter which was erected by his grandfather and after him his father was in

possession of the same.

As regards the possession of the building, the evidence of two witnesses called by the

Plaintiff is important. These two witnesses testified that there was a hut but they said

they did not know who was living in it. This evidence cannot be acted upon. The

subject-matter is a place situated by the side of the Galle-Matara Road which is very

conspicuous for its location. It is common ground that if a hut is in existence in some

place, there must be somebody who must be in possession or occupation thereof.

There is a clear difference between an occupied hut and an unoccupied hut. If there

was no one in the hut, the question arises as to why the Plaintiff failed to take

possession of the hut. The testimony given by the two witnesses of the Plaintiff is

unworthy of credit.

P2 is a receipt for payment of compensation of Rs.lO/= to the defendant's mother "Mai

Nona". This is clear proof to strengthen the position taken by the Defendant that his

mother was in possession of the subject-matter. If the Plaintiff says that the

defendant's mother was paid compensation for the hut or for her occupation, he failed

to establish that immediately thereafter, or at least from 1931, he took possession of

the hut or the land. The defendant's position is that he has been in continuous and

uninterrupted possession of the hut up to the time the dispute arose. This position of

the Defendant has not been contradicted. The Defendant took up the position that

they had been in possession since 1931. If payment of compensation to the defendant's

mother interrupted possession, there is no evidence that was led by the Plaintiff that

the uninterrupted and undisturbed possession alleged by the Defendant was aver

disturbed by the Plaintiff.

3

Disregarding the evidence of the Defendant on his prescriptive possession to the

subject-matter, the learned Additional District Judge delivered his judgment on

15.12.1995 in favour of the Plaintiff. If after 1931 the Defendant had been there, that

would amount to adverse possession and the learned District Judge does not deal

with this aspect at all in his judgment dated 15.12.1995.

It is settled law that in an action for declaration title to property, where the legal title

is in the Plaintiff but the property is in the possession of the Defendant, the burden of

proof is on the Defendant that his possession is lawful -see Siyaneris vs. jayasinghe

Udenis de Silva 52 NLR. 289. In the present case, the Defendant has satisfactorily

discharged his burden of long possession of the subject-matter. The Plaintiff has failed

to disprove the defendant's long and prescriptive possession, though he has

established paper title.

The other matter that this Court has to look into in this case is whether the

Defendant could claim rights to a building, which was under construction in place of

the hut having regard to the fact that there is no soil right. It is settled law that a

building or a hut cannot be separated from the soil. I hold the view that the learned

District Judge was in error in rejecting the defendant's position. The Defendant

cannot claim right to the boutique only, without claiming right to the soil on which it

stands. When he claims prescriptive right to the boutique, it goes without saying that

he also claims right to the soil on which the boutique stands. The evidence of the

Defendant is very clear that he and his predecessors in title had been possessing the

boutique together the land on which it stood uninterruptedly for a long time.

It is clear beyond doubt that our law does not recognise the ownership of a building

apart from the land on which it stands. If at the time the defendant's grandfather and

father had built the hut or boutique where they ran a tea kiosk, it cannot be said that

they had no interest in the land. Their position was that they claimed prescriptive

right to the land on which they built the boutique. Hence they claimed prescriptive

right to the land and the boutique. If that be so, the boutique goes with the land,

which the Defendant claims on a long and uninterrupted prescriptive title.

\ ,

It appears that the dispute has arisen for the first time on 24.09.1990 when the

Defendant tried to erect a building with brick~walls instead of a thatched hut. It is

evident by the unmarked photograph filed of record in the brief file. It is not

challenged by the Plaintiff that he Defendant had got an assessment number (344) for

this boutique. Moreover in the Plan bearing No. 2377 A the boutique has been shown

by the surveyor. All this supports the statement of the Defendant that he has been in

possession of the subject~matter.

In considering all these matters, I have no hesitation but to come to the conclusion

that the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge cannot be allowed to

stand. I therefore allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and that the Defendant is

entitled to costs here and the Court below.
