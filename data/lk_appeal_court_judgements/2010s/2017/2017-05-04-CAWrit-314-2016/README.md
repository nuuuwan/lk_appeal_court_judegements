(a) that For a Writ in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing

the rl to 17 Respondents to INIform their duties by preventing

the construction and the operation of the unauthorized

warehouse of the 18111 Respondent at Elip/chchawatte Road,

Welivita, Kaduwela. '"

(b) to Issue an Interim Order preventing the 18117 Respondent

carrying on further constructions in the alleged unauthorized

warehouse and further businesses at the said premises at

Elipichchawatte Road, Welivita, Kaduwela.

(c) to issue an Interim Order directing the rl to 17117 Respondents

to prevent thet/. 8'11 Respondent from conducting any business

activities at the warehouse premises at Elipichchawatte Road,

Welivita, Kaduwela the subject matter hereof till the hearing

and final determination of this application.

The Counsel for the Petitioner supported the application for notice on

the 03.10.2016 and reserved their rights to support for the interim

relief. On 26.10.2016 when the case was mentioned for notice

returnable the Counsel for the Petitioner moved Court, that he wants

to support for the interim relief. Accordingly the matter was fixed to

support for interim relief on 07.12.2016. On that date all Counsels

made submission and moved time to file written submissions. To file

C.A.Writ AppUcation No.314/2016 Page 6/12

written submissions the case was mentioned on 24.01.2017 there the

Counsel for the 15 th and 16th Respondents moved time to file written

submissions, time granted till 17.02.2017. On that date the Counsel for

the 15 th and 16th Respondents informed Couli that they wi II not be

filing written submissions. Anyhow the Additional Solicitor General

who is appeanng for the I st to I t h and 19th Respondents moved

further time to file written submissions and time granted till

09.03.2017. When the case was called on 09.03.2017 Counsel moved

time to file written submissions and the Court granted time till

17.03.2017. After all written submissions the matter is fixed for order

on interim relief.

Counsel for the Petitioner submits that he is supporting for the interim

relief as prayed in para' C 'and '8' and submits that the Court to

order the 15t to 1 i h Respondents to prevent the 18th Respondent from

any construction and any business activities in the warehouse at

Elipichchawatta Road, Welivita, Kaduwela.

Comparing the final relief prayed to para' A' and the interim relief in

para 'c' are almost identical. Prayer '8' of the petition of the petitioners

speak of preventing the 18th Respondent carrying on further constructions

in the alleged unauthorized warehouse and further businesses at the

Elipichchawatta Road, Welivita, Kaduwela. Comparing the main relief

prayed in paragraph 'A' it appears almost identical relief as prayed as

final r~lief.

C.A.Writ Application No.314j2016 Page 7/12

This order only deals with the application for interim relief, hence I

do not venture into the discuss entire materials before the Court. I

consider only very limited materials, which are directly relevant to the

interim relief.

The Additional Solicitor General in her objections submitted that the

interim relief claimed is virtually get the final relief.'

A.S.G. submits that the interim relief as prayed in the first part of the

prayer 'b' does not arise because the construction was completed

therefore issuing a stay order will not serve any purpose. It is

confirmed by Counsel for the Petitioner as well as the Counsel for

18th Respondent. The Counsel for the Petitioner submits that construction

will not be considered concluded until Certificate Of Confirmation (COC)

been issued, in this case there is no COC produced in Court therefore the

construction must be stopped. Considering all submissions, for the

purposes of interim relief, COC, in my view is only procedural matter.

There is no construction to be stopped at the juncture.

Staying the business of the 18th Respondent is final relief claimed by

the petitioner and the petitioners to show by doing/continuing with

business may cause irreparable damages to the petitioners immediately.

All Counsels have made very lengthy submissions on these Issues.

C.A.Writ Application No.314/2016 Page 8/12

The granting of Interim Relief.

In the case of Duwearachchi vs Vincent Perera (1984 (2) SLR 94) has

laid dOlI'11 three principles which COllrts should consider 'when they

arc cal1ed upon to decide the issuance or non-issuance of a stay

order. This has been fol1owed consistently thereafter and recently in

the cases of:

(a) Ceylon tobacco Company PLC vs Maithripala Sirisena and

others (CA Writ Application No. 336/2012-CA Minutes 22.02.2013)

(b) Natwealtha Securities Limited vs the Monetary Board of

Sri Lanka and others. (CA Writ Application No. 335/2015 -

CA Minutes of 29.03.2016).

The three principles are as fol1ows:

(a) Wi11 a .final order be rendered nugatory if the Petitioner IS

successful?

(b) Where does the balance of convenience lie?

( c) Wi11 irreparable or irremediable mischief or injury be caused

to either party?

The view taken by the Indian Supreme Court In Colgate Palmolive

(India) Ltd. Vs. "industan Lever Ltd., AIR 1999 SC 3105 was

that the other considerations which ought to weigh with the Court

hearing the application or petition for the grant of injunctions,

which are as below:

C.A.Writ Application No.314/2016 Page 9/12

The Counsel for the Petitioner submits that the principle of wrongdoer IS

applicable in this application and made following submissions.

It is for this reason that the Courts qf Sri Lanka have upheld and

brilliantly conceived the salutary principle of Law namely "that a

wrongdoer should not get an}' benefit '/;'om it's own wrongdoing". The

concept of unjust enrichment is also enshrined in our common Law.

These principles of Law permeate the entire jurisprudence of our

countrl' and has been safe guarded by ollr Courts.

The said principle was reiterated and set out in an Interim Injunction

case which was decided in the Court of Appeal in the case of

Seelawathie Mellawa V Millie Keerthiratne 1982 ISLR -I SLR 384 in

relation to a Lease and eviction of a business pending the final

determination of the case and the Interim Order was upheld that a

wrongdoer should not benefit form his wrongdoing.

The learned ASG and Counsel for the 18th Respondent vehemently

refuted the allegation and submits that the said wrongdoer principle will

not be applicable in this case.

It is should be noted that the Petitioner In para 30 of the petition

submits to Court as follows:

"The Petitioners plead that the 18/11 and 19111 - Respondents is named

011(l' plllposes of notice."

Considering the submissions, I find that the ] 8th Respondent is the

developer of the land who seems to be the main or one close to the

main Respondent, as per the submissions of the Respondents the said

premIses is presently leased to Fortune - Agro Industries (Pvt) Limited

and that person is not been made as a party in this application. The

Respondent submits that this application perse is misconceived because

the relevant and important parties are not before the Court. At this

juncture, I do not wish to make any decision in this regard but for

limited purposes paragraph 30 of the petition and the prayer appears

to be contradicting to each other. The Petitioner is seeking to stop the

business of the ] 8th Respondent or his lessee and has not made them

as substantial palty to this application.

The available materials before the Court convince us that the construction

perse is completed and the Company is running the business. Therefore

the major relief claimed by way of interim relief will be futile.

As held in the case of P S Bus Company vs. Ceylon Transport

Board, 62 NLR 491, a Writ will not issue if it is vexatious or futile.

The Counsel further submitted the principle of Certiorarified Mandamus

and made lengthy submissions of this concept and its applicability in

this case. Considering the prayers of interim relief, I think the Court

should not consider the concept of Certiorarified Mandamus at this

juncture.

C.A.Writ Application No.314/2016 Page 11/12

Considering all submissions the Court is not satisfied that there is

need of issuing interim relief at this juncture. Application for interim

relief is refused and the matter is fixed for argument.
