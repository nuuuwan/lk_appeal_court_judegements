ORDER

P Padman Surasena J

The 2nd Party Petitioner Appellant1 is the appellant in the instant case

before this Court. This appeal appears to have not been listed in Court

presumably asthe briefs are not yet prepared. It is in such circumstances

that the 2nd Party Petitioner Appellant (hereinafter sometimes called and

referred to as the 'Appellant') has filed a petition and an affidavit along

with a motion in this Court seeking an interim order staying all further

proceedings in the Magistrate's/Primary Courts case No. 84192/66 until the

final determination of this appeal.

Learned Primary Court judge by his order dated 2012-05-21 had ordered to

demolish the boundary wall constructed by the Appellant.

The application for revision filed in the Provincial High Court holden at

Colombo to revise the order made by the learned Primary Court Judge had

been dismlssed by its judgment dated 2016-03-17.

1 Referred to as the 2nd Party Petitioner in the caption of the petition.

This Appeal has been preferred against the judgment dated 2016-03-17

Judgement delivered by the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial

High Court of the Western Province Holden at Colombo in the said revision

application.

It is the submission of the learned President's Counsel for the Appellant

that this appeal would be nugatory if the order of the learned Primary

Court Judge is carried out.

The judgment in the case of Jayantha Gunasekara V Jayatissa Gunasekara

and others2 what a divisional bench of this Court had held is that mere

lodging in the Court of Appeal, an appeal against a judgment of the High

Court in the exercise of its revisionary power in terms of article 154 P (3)

(b) of the Constitution, does not automatically stay the execution of the

order of the High Court. A passage which would be relevant here from that

judgment is as follows. " .... Obviously, to put off the execution process

until the appeal is heard would tantamount to prolong the agony and to let

the breach of peace to continue for a considerable length of time. This in

my opinion cannot be the remedy the Parliament has clearly decided upon.

Hence I am confident that the construction we are mindful of placing by

this judgment would definitely suppress the mischief and subtle inventions

and evasions for continuance of the mischief . ... If

The preliminary objection that the learned counsel for the Respondents has

raised is with regard to the maintainability of this application on the basis

that the Appellant had not furnished any material pertaining to the case.

Admittedly all what the Appellant has filed in Court with regard to this

application is a petition and an affidavit. Thus, we are inclined to accept

the submission by the learned counsel for the Respondents that he is

handicapped to respond to this application without any material pertaining

to the case. Therefore, it is clear that this Court is not in a position to

evaluate such an application without any material pertaining to the case

under its scrutiny.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to uphold the preliminary

objection raised by the Respondent and proceed to refuse the application

for interim relief.
