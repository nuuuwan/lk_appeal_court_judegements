The plaintiff-appellant (hereinafter referred to as 'plaintiff') filed the above action on 28th April

1988 in the District Court of Galle seeking to partition the land called Welabodawatta also known

as Dangahaowita situated at Modera Patuwata in the district of Galle. The land was said to be

AD. R1. PO in extent. The corpus has been depicted as lot A in plan No. 345 dated 08.12.1989

made by Mr. Anton Samararatne, Licensed Surveyor. Initially only the pt defendant-respondent

was named as a defendant and the plaintiff claimed that each of them are entitled to Y2 share of

the corpus. After the institution of the action the 2nd and 3rd defendant-respondents were added

as parties as a result of an application made by the plaintiff for an interim injunction against them

restraining them from cutting down trees and construction of buildings which was settled on an

undertaking given by them.

The 2nd defendant-respondent (hereinafter referred to as '2nd defendant') filed a statement of

claim and pleaded that the land depicted in plan no. 345 is not the land sought to be partitioned

by the plaintiff, but is a distinct and separate land which belonged entirely to the 2nd defendant

and that the plaintiff had pointed to the surveyor the land called Dangahawatta also known as

Palaturuwatta situated at Modera Patuwata in Dodanduwa containing in extent AD. R2. PO.

After trial, the learned Additional District Judge dismissed the action of the plaintiff with costs

inter alia on the basis that the plaintiff had failed to prove the corpus as the identical land referred

to in the plaint and that the 2nd defendant had satisfied court that the land depicted in plan no.

345 is land belonging exclusively to the 2nd defendant. Hence this appeal by the plaintiff.

Since the identity of the corpus is a fundamental issue in this case the preliminary survey report

prepared in terms of Section 18 of Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 acquires importance as Section

18 (l)(a) (iii) requires the surveyor to state in his report, supported by affidavit, whether or not

the land surveyed by him is in his opinion substantially the same as the land sought to be

partitioned as described in the schedule to the plaint. Mr. Anton Samararatne, Licensed Surveyor

who prepared the preliminary survey report has stated therein that he thinks the land he

surveyed and the land described in the schedule to the plaint is the same. He has not made a

categorical statement that both the lands are identical. He has further recorded that the 2nd

defendant informed him that the land belongs to her.

The learned Additional District Judge has also considered the deeds on which the plaintiff relies

on to establish title and observed that the land described therein is about one rood in extent

whereas the land depicted in plan no. 345 is 19.25 perches in extent. The evidence shows that

previously when the 2nd defendant attempted to construct a house on her land bearing

assessment no. 26/7 saranajothi mawatha the plaintiff had objected claiming that the 2nd

defendant sought to do so on land belonging to the plaintiff. The learned Additional District

Judge concludes that the land pointed out by the plaintiff to be partitioned bears assessment no.

26/7 which belongs to the 2nd defendant. It is in these circumstances that the learned Additional

District Judge has dismissed the action.

I have considered the evidence led in this case and agree with the findings and the judgment of

the learned Additional District Judge. At the argument Mr. Daya Guruge counsel for plaintiff

informed court that although the plaintiff has sought to assail the judgment of the learned

Additional District Judge on three grounds, he is not in a position to support anyone of the said

grounds. He in fact called upon the court to dismiss the appeal without costs. We appreciate this

concession from counsel and wish that such acts will become practices in appeals where the

appellant does not have an arguable case.

I affirm the findings and judgment of the learned Additional District Judge and dismiss the appeal

without costs.

M.M.A. Gaffoor J.

I agree.
