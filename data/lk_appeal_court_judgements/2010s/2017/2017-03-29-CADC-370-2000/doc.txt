The Plaintiff - Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Plaintiffs)

filed action by plaint dated 16.01.1998 in the District Court of Avissawella

against the Defendant- Appellants (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Defendants) for a sum of Rs. 200,0001- as damages for causing the death of

their 10 year old daughter as a result of the negligent driving of the 1 st

Defendant.

The Defendants filed Answer dated 26.02.1999 and denied the allegations of the

Plaintiffs and moved for a dismissal of the Plaint on the basis inter alia that the

1 st Defendant was not the driver of the vehicle which caused the aforesaid

3

accident and as such that the 1 st Defendant never caused such accident and

further that the 2nd Plaintiff and the deceased daughter were guilty of

contributory negligence.

Trial commenced on 30.09.1999 and 2 admissions were recorded by the parties

and the Plaintiffs raised 7 issues and the Defendants raised 6 issues. The

evidence was led on behalf of the Plaintiffs including that of the 2nd Plaintiff

and the Plaintiffs closed the case marking documents PI - P7.

Thereafter the 1 st Defendant gave evidence on behalf of the Defence and upon

conclusion of his evidence the Defence sought to lead the evidence of the

purported driver of the vehicle i.e. one A.K. Rupasinghe.

At this stage it transpired that the said A.K. Rupasinghe was not listed in the list

of witnesses and documents on behalf of the Defence, moreover, that the

Defence has failed to tender a list of witnesses and documents as per the

provisions of Section 121, and as such the Defence made an application under

Section 175 of the Civil Procedure Code to allow for the evidence of the said

A.K. Rupasinghe.

The learned District Court Judge pronounced the order dated 25.10.1999 and

refused the application of the Defence to lead the evidence of the said A.K.

Rupasinghe and therefore the case for the Defence was concluded.

After both parties tendered their respective written submissions the learned Trial

Judge delivered judgment on 14.06.2000 in favour of the Plaintiffs.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment the Defendants preferred the instant

appeal to set aside the judgment dated 14.06.2000 and for a dismissal of the

Plaint dated 16.01.1998.

The main contention of the Defendant is that natural justice has been denied to

the Defendants since the Defence was not allowed to call the aforementioned

A.K. Rupasinghe who allegedly caused the accident. The Defendants contends

that the learned District Judge has totally disregarded the Defendant's story. The

1 st Defendants story is that it was A.K. Rupasinghe who drove the vehicle at the

time of incident and not the 1 st Defendant.

It is clear that after a careful reading of the impugned judgment of the learned

District Court Judge that the findings of the said judgment were arrived at, after

a careful and meticulous evaluation of the evidence presented before Court.

This Court concurs with the order of the learned District Judge to disallow the

testimony of the said A.K. Rupasinghe for the reasons stated in order dated

25.1 0.1999 and if the Defendants were aggrieved by the said order they should

have taken steps to remedy that at that juncture.

The Bus driver and conductor who gave evidence on behalf of the Plaintiff has

clearly stated in evidence that the said A.K. Rupasinghe was on a bus at the

time material to the incident and further that they were puzzled to hear the news

that the said A.K. Rupasinghe was wanted in connection to a vehicle accident

when the said A.K. Rupasinghe was with them moments before the said

accident.

The learned Counsel for the Defendants submit that the learned District Judge

has totally disregarded 'VI' Uournal entry dated 13.08.1997) which reflects the

accused in the Magistrates Court case as the said A.K. Rupasinghe.

I do not find any merit in such submissions as a cursory reading of the journal

entries reveal that he said A.K. Rupasinghe was released by 23.10.1998 and the

Magistrates Court continued against the 1 st Defendant who was named as the 2nd

5

Suspect. Further, the Journal Entries specifically states that the said A.K.

Rupasinghe is not a suspect in this case.

The Defendants further contend that the 2nd Plaintiff was guilty of negligence. It

is noted that no issue has been raised to this effect although the Defendants

answer dated 26.02.1999 alleges that the said accident was caused by the

negligence of the 2nd Plaintiff. This Court is not inclined to agree with this

contention and finds that the learned District Court Judge has, after a careful

consideration and evaluation of the evidence and applicable law, arrived at the

correct conclusion that it was the direct Negligence of the 1 st Defendant which

caused the death of the 10 year old minor child of the Plaintiffs which is

evidenced by the Police Observation Report marked as P6a which places the

vehicle on the wrong side of the road at the time of incident.

This Court finds that the learned District Court Judge has accurately analysed

the facts elucidated before Court and has given adequate reasons for the

findings pronounced by the judgment dated 14.06.2000.

Therefore, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the findings of the learned

District Judge and dismiss the instant appeal with costs fixed at Rs. 15,0001-.

Further the Rs. 200,0001- as prayed for in prayer (a) of the Plaint is granted and

shall be paid together with legal interest from the date of pronouncement of the

judgment i.e. 14.06.2000.

Appeal dismissed with costs.
