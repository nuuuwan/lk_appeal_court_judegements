This is an application filed by the Petitioner seeking the interfering

of this Court in the order of imprisonment made by the Magistrate Court

of Attanagalla in a maintenance application. The facts of this case as per

the petition are that the Petitioner was ordered to pay the maintenance

under the Maintenance Act but was in arrears of 116 months and the

Court has imposed a term of 116 months imprisonment. The contention

of the petitioner is that the said term of imprisonment is illegal. The

learned DSG submitted that the section 8 of the Maintenance Act

provides for the Court to impose one month imprisonment for the failure

to pay the maintenance for one month and the period of imprisonment

that a Magistrate Court can order is governed by the Maintenance Act,

not by the Criminal Procedure Code.

The fact that the Petitioner was in arrears of maintenance for 116

months was not in issue. The only issue was whether the Magistrate

Court can impose a term of imprisonment of 116 months. The section 5

of the Maintenance Act No.37 of 1999 reads thus;

5. (1) Subject to the provisions contained in section 10, where any

person against whom an order is made under section 2 or the

proviso to section 11 (1) thereinafter called the "respondent'')

neglects to comply with such order, the Magistrate may, for every

breach of the order, sentence such respondent for the whole or any

part of each months allowance in default, to simple or rigorous

imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month.

(2) The Magistrate may, if an application is made in that behalf by

any person entitled to receive any payment under an order of

maintenance, before passing a sentence of imprisonment on the

respondent, issue a warrant directing the amount in default to be

levied in the manner provided by law for levying fines imposed by

Magistrates in the Magistrate Courts.

In the present case the learned Magistrate had ordered the

imprisonment of one month for nonpayment every one month.

The power of the sentencing by the Magistrate Court is provided in

section 14 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The section 14 reads thus;

A Magistrate's Court may impose any of the following sentences: -

(a) imprisonment of either description for a term not

exceeding two years;

(b) fine not exceeding one thousandfive hundred rupees;

[2, 21 of2005J Repealed

(d) any lawful sentence combining any of the sentences

aforesaid:

Provided that anything in this section shall not be deemed to repeal

the provisions of any enactment in force whereby special powers of

punishment are given.

Under the proviso to this section the Magistrate Court can impose

any term of sentence if it is governed by any enactment in force whereby

special powers of punishment are given. The Maintenance Act is such an

enactment where special powers given to the Magistrate Court. Therefore

the term of imprisonment that could be imposed by the Magistrate Court

in a maintenance case for non compliance of the order to pay the

allowance is governed by the Maintenance Act.

It had been held in the case of Siriwardane V. D.Emalin 59 NLR

263 that;

Where a person who is ordered to pay maintenance is in arrears

for more than six months, the Magistrate has jurisdiction to

sentence him to imprisonment for a term which may exceed six

months. In such a case, the maximum term of imprisonment is

determined by section 8 of the Maintenance Ordinance and not by

section 312 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Therefore the learned Magistrate's order of imprisonment for 116

months is not an illegal order.

The next issue that I have to consider is whether the sentence is

reasonable. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner submits that a good

part of his life has to be spend in the prison and the state funds that is the

public money that has to be spend on the Petitioner. The reasonableness

of the term of imprisonment has to be considered with the fact that the

difficulties faced by the applicant in nonpayment of the maintenance in

the maintenance case. Not paying the maintenance for 116 months n:teans

..

that the applicant had to survive for 116 months without the support of

the Petitioner. Furthennore the Petitioner neglected the Court order for

116 months until he was sentenced.

The state funds had to spend on the prisoners. The prisons are

maintained by the State to uphold the rule of law. Therefore, spending

money on the prisoners cannot be considered as wastage.

The Petition is dismissed without costs.
