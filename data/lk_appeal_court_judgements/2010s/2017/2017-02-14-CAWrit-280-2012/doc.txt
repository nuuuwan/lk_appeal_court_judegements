For the 1st - 3rd Respondents.

: 09th August, 2016

: 13th February, 2017

The first and second petitioners have filed this application praying

for a writ of certiorari to quash the notice dated 12/07/2012 (marked P10)

and to quash the order made by the third respondent on 07/08/2012 and

also for a writ of prohibition to prohibit the first, second and third

respondents from conducting further inquiry in respect of the petitioners.

The petitioners have also prayed for a writ of Mandamus to compel the

2

.

first, second and third respondents to take prompt action to recover on

behalf of the petitioners sums awarded by the determination in P7.

The first and second respondents have been Director and

Chairman of the fourth respondent company. They both have resigned

from their respective designations on the 31 st of May 2007. The

petitioners have complained to the first and second respondents for non

payment of gratuity. The third respondent a representative of the first

respondent had summoned them for an inquiry and has recorded their

statements. After the said inquiry the second respondent had issued

letters to the fourth respondent in terms of Payment of Gratuity Act no.

12 of 1983 to pay gratuity to the petitioners. The petitioners states that

the fourth respondent failed to comply with the order of the second

respondent to pay the said money to them and that they informed the first

respondent to take steps to enforce the determination made by the

second respondent. These letters were marked as P1 to P11 by the

petitioners. The petitioners and the fourth respondent were thereafter

summoned to another inquiry by the third respondent on the 07th of

August 2012. The petitioners have filed the instant application to stop the

first to third respondents from conducting a further inquiry.

3

The learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the

respondents upon making their determination as required by law after a

comprehensive inquiry can not review their own determination. The

petitioners stated that the respondent's attempt to reopen the inquiry after

the fourth respondent made representations to the Secretary to the

Minsitry of Labour, .tantamounts to an interference and invasion of the

rule of law.

The petitioners further stated that if a party is dissatisfied with a

determination of the first to third respondents made under the Payment

of Gratuity Act after inquiry the only remedy available to that party is to

make an appeal to this court by way of a writ application.

The petitioners' counsel argued that the first respondent is a quasi-

judicial officer who makes binding orders and that the first respondent

duly made such an order which he can not review. The petitioners cited

the judgments in Gould vs Bacup Local Board (1881) 50 LJMC 44 and

Livingstone vs Westminster Cpn (1904) 2 KB 109, Nadaraja Limited

vs Krishnadasan (1975) 78 NLR 255, Aislaby Estate Ltd vs V.

Weerasekera 77 NLR 241, Horana Plantations PLC vs Minister of

Labour CA (Writ) 136/2010 and stated that once an award is made the

4

first respondent ceases his involvement in the said application and he

can not make any direction in the same matter.

The petitioners stated that the dictation by the Secretary to reopen

the inquiry is unlawful. They cited the judgment in Sam ada sa vs

Wijeratne, Commissioner General of Excise et al (1999) 2 SLR 85.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General for the first to third

respondents submitted that the inquiry proceedings were centered on

EPF payments and the decision on gratuity was made without a proper

perusal of documents, facts and circumstances in the present case where

the complainants were directors and shareholders of the company who

later sold the company to the present owners. He stated that according

to the Payment of Gratuity Act only a workman is entitled to gratuity and

that the petitioners were the primary shareholders and Directors of the

company.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General further stated that the third

respondent had not inquired into the status of the employment of the

petitioners in the company nor have they looked into the contract of sale

of the company to the present owners. He stated that the second

respondent who directed the third respondent has correctly observed the

5

necessity of the above facts to be assessed before determining whether

the petitioners are entitled to the payment of gratuity, as such the material

evidence has not been furnished to consider at the inquiry therefore the

administrative body has the powers to continue to hear the inquiry by

calling for documentary evidence until such body is satisfactorily provided

with evidence to make a reasonable and fair determination.

He further stated as provided by sec. 8 (1) of the said Act until the

decision is perfected by the filing of the certificate in the Magistrate's

Court any other communication shall be considered informal

communication which can be varied from. The judgments in Lamont vs

Fry's Metals Ltd. (1985) 1 RLP 470, Hanks vs Ace High Production

Ltd (1978) 1 CR 1155 were c,ited in support of this argument.

The respondents further stated that substantial evidence have not

been submitted to show that the petitioners were employees of the

company, that there was no contract of employment or board resolution

of the company or salary slip to substantiate these employment.

The respondents stated that in the event an administrative body

has acted contrary to the principles of natural justice such body is allowed

to continue, rehear or reopen the inquiry. Judgments in Ridge vs

6

Baldwin 1964 AC 40, Regina vs Kensington and Chelsea Rent

Tribunal ex parte MacFarlane 1974 1 WLR 1486 were cited in this

favour.

The respondents further stated that the petitioners have not come

to this court with clean hands, and that they have acted maliciously to

prevent the first respondent from continuing with the inquiry. He also

stated that the petitioners have come to the first respondent after a lapse

of 3 years from their resignation and have not disclosed information

regarding the conditions of sale of the company when they were

Shareholders and Directors of the company.

The learned counsel for the fourth respondent submitted that the

petitioners were members of the Board of directors of the fourth

respondent company during the period stated in their claim and that the

directors do not automatically become employees of the company by

virtue of having been appointed directors.

The fourth respondent's counsel stated that the petitioners and the

then Board of directors of the fourth respondent company negotiated and

disclosed assets and liabilities and other contingencies and enabled the

new team of management to carry out the acquisition of the fourth

7

II

~ flIf i i,f

I!II

i

respondent company, and that the fourth respondent trusted and was

made to believe that what was disclosed were the only assets and

liabilities of the company.

The fourth respondent further submitted that the petitioners having

collected Rs. 100 million for their shares in the fourth respondent

company and waiting for 3 years have filed an application in the Labour

Tribunal to unjustly enrich themselves. He stated that since the Labour

Tribunal was not revealed with the relevant facts the Labour Tribunal

directed the fourth respondent to pay the sum due to the petitioners.

Citing the judgments in Hanks vs High Production Ltd and Ridge

vs Baldwin 1964 AC 40, Regina vs Kensington and Chelsea Rent

Tribunal ex parte MacFarlan (1974) 1 NLR 1486 the fourth respondent

stated that if a tribunal having considered all the arguments is of the

opinion that it would be proper to reopen the matter and that the Tribunal

has the power to reopen the inquiry.

The fourth respondent argued that the petitioners have not invited

the attention of this court to any law which prohibits the first respondent

from having the right to conduct the inquiry called for by the letter P7

annexed to the petition.

.,

On perusal of the judgments cited by the petitioners I find that they

are not relevant to this application. The second respondent has decided

to continue the inquiry to ascertain the exact position and verify whether

the petitioners have acted as Directors or as employees of the fourth

respondent company and to ascertain the details of their salary during

the relevant time. In the inquiry proceedings produced to court it is stated

that no documents were produced to support the petitioners EPF claims.

The inquiry had been centered on EPF payments and the decision on

gratuity had been made without any proper perusal of documents and

facts. Where material evidence has not been furnished and thus not

afforded the opportunity to take into consideration at the inquiry the

administrative body has the power to continue to hear the inquiry until

such body is satisfied.

Until the decision is perfected by the filing of the certificate in the

Magistrate's Court any other communication is considered informal which

can be varied from. In the instant case the parties were given an

opportunity to present further arguments.

It will be in the best interest of both parties to continue and inquire

into the position of the parties before filing of the final certificate in the

Magistrate's Court to recover gratuity.

9

For the afore stated reason I decide to refuse the application of the

petitioners with costs fixed at Rs. 100,0001=.

Application dismissed.
