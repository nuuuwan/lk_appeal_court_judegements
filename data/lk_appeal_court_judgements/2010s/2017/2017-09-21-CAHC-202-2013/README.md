In summary, as per the prosecution, on 20.11.2005 A. Achchu Mohamed of

Meeravodai (PW2) complained to the Police that his wife's sister Mohamed

Lebbe Fowziya, Fowziya's husband Meerasahib Ahamed Lebbe, his wife's

mother Asia Ummah and his children were sleeping at home and that'he woke

up as Fowziya and her husband switched on the light at midnight opened the

gate and went to the courtyard saying "thief", and F owziya had screamed "he is

standing there". At this time. Achchu Mohamed had heard gun shots and he had

rushed inside as he was afraid to go outside. When the gun shots had seized he

had gone out and looked to see F owziya and her Husband screaming with

injuries and blood. Mohamed Lebbe Fowziya and Meerasahib Ahamed Lebbe

were taken to Valaichchenai Hospital where Meerasahib Ahamed Lebbe died

and thereafter F owziya was transferred to the Batticaloa Hosital where she also

died.

As correctly submitted by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, the case for the

prosecution hinges on a dying declaration emanating from PW 1, Mohamed

Lebbe Umadhu Hajarah.

The grounds of Appeal submitted by the learned Counsel for the Appellant are

as follows;

1. The Conviction which is solely based on an infirm dying declaration is

legally and factually untenable,

2. The learned Trial Judge has failed to address his judicial mind to the

inherent weakness in the purported dying declaration,

4

3. The learned Trial Judge has been totally oblivious to the fact that the

evidence of Hajarah is wholly contradicted by the evidence of Jauffer

whih renders the conviction factually unsustainable,

4. The findings ofthe learned Trial Judge that the witness Hajarah is reliable

and credible is totally fallacious and wholly contrary to the evidence led

at the trial.

The learned DSG for the State concedes that 'there is inevitably a doubt in the

version ofthe prosecution witness Hajarah's evidence.'

In the case of Ranasinghe V. Attorney General 2007 (1) SLR 218 it was held as

follows;

(i) When a dying declaration is considered as an item of evidence against

an accused person in a criminal trial the trial Judge/Jury must bear in

mind the following weaknesses.

(a) The statement of the deceased person was not made under oath;

(b) The statement of the deceased person has not been tested by

cross examination,

(ii) The trial Judge/Jury must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the

following matters:

(a) whether the deceased in fact made such a statement;

(b) whether the statement made by the deceased was true and

accurate;

(c) whether the statement made by the deceased could be accepted

beyond reasonable doubt?

(d) whether the evidence of the witness who testifies about the

dying declaration could be accepted beyond reasonable doubt?

(e) whether the witness is telling the truth;

(t) whether the deceased was able to speak at the time the alleged

declaration was made;

(iii) The trial Judge had totally failed to consider the principles relating to

the dying declaration and the risk of acting upon a dying declaration;

In the case of Lukshman vs. Republic of Sri Lanka 2010 (2) SLR 152 it was

held inter alia that where a dying statement is produced three questions arise for

the Court. Firstly whether it is authentic. Secondly if it is authentic whether it is

admissible in whole or in part. Thirdly the value of the whole or part that is

admitted.

In the case of Sigera vs. Attorney General 2011 (1) SLR 201it was held inter

alia that;

(4) First and foremost a judge must apply his mind and decide whether

the dying declaration is a true and accepted statement - in doing so he

must be mindful of the fact that the statement was not made under oath,

that the statement of the deceased person has not been tested in cross

examination and that the person who, made the dying declaration is not a

witness at the trial.

(5) An accused can be convicted for murder based mainly and solely on a

dying declaration made by a deceased, - without corroborating under

certain circumstances. It would not be repugnant or obnoxious to the law

to convict an accused based solely on a dying declaration.

In the said case Ranjith Silva. J states;

"In order to justifY an inference of guilt from the circumstantial evidence

the inculpatory facts must be incompatible with the innocence of the

accused and incapable of explanation upon any other reasonable

hypothesis than that of his guilt".

In the instant case as per the Hajarah's (PWl) testimony the victim Fawziya had

allegedly made a dying declaration implying that the Appellant had shot her.

However as pointed out by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, in evidence in

chief PWladmits that he did not mention the said dying declaration in his 1st

statement to the Police. Further, in cross examination PWI admits that he had

failed to mention the name of the Appellant in the 1 st Police Statement as well

as the inquest. PW 1 further admits that the victim had not mentioned anything

to him.

As correctly contended by the learned Counsel for the Appellant, both PW2 and

PW4 have stated in evidence that the victim Fawziya had not spoken on the way

to hospital. This evidence contradicts the evidence of PWI whose position is

that the said dying declaration was made on the way to hospital.

Further, PW 4 who was the son of the victim, who took the victim to the hospital

testified that the victim had mentioned that she could identifY the perpetrator but

that "she could identify them if she saw them."

The learned Counsel for the Appellant relies on the Indian case of Smt. Kamala

Vs. State of Pan jab (1993) 1 SCC 1 which held that;

"A dying decleration should satisfy all the necessary tests and one such

importatnt test is that if there are more that one dying decleration they should be

consistent particularly in material points".

She further sites the Indian case of LelIa Srinivasa Rao Vs. State of Andhra

Pradesh (2004) 9 SCC 713 which held that it would not be safe to act on such

conflicting dying declarations to the accused.

In the instant appeal it is clear that the evidence of Hajarah who stated that the

victim F owziya made a dying declaration to the effect that the Appellant had

shot at her is contradictory and un-collaborated when considering the evidence

in toto.

Upholding the best traditions of the Attorney General's Department the learned

DSG has acknowledged this weakness in the case for the prosecution.

In this context and for the reasons as more fully described above this court is of

the view that the learned High Court Judge had erred in law and fact by arriving

at a conclusion of guilt on the strength of a contradictory and un-collaborated

testimony about a dying declaration.

F or the aforesaid reasons this appeal is allowed. The judgment of the learned

High Court Judge dated 10.12.2013 is hereby set aside and the Appellant is

acquitted.

Appeal Allowed.
