24.10.2017.

Counsel for the accused-appellant on '~he last date indicated that he is

challenging the conviction but he says considering the circumstances specially

there was one injury caused on the deceased with an empty liquor bottle.

Therefore, there is no pre-meditation. Hence he moves that the conviction for

murder to be reduced to a conviction of cul~lable hom:c;d0 net oi;";ounting to

murder on the basis of sudden fight.

Mr. Parinda Ranasinghe, Senior Deputy Solicitor Generai appears for the

Attorney General maintaining the highest traditions of the Attorney General's

Department and submits that he concedes ~o the application on the basis of

grave and sudden provocation. He leaves a sentence to the Court.

We consider the available materia! s92cially the Post Mortem Report

available in the court record, we find that there is only one injury on the head

and the cause of death was due to CRANIO-CEREBRAL injury due to blunt force

trauma to the head. After careful consideration, \'Ve find that this is a fit and

proper case for a conviction under Section 297 of the Pe:h~i CUC-2 for culpable

homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of suddEn fjg:ht. Therefore,

we vacate the conviction for murder and convict the ao:,us2cl'-dppedant under

Section 297 of the Penal Code. Regarding the: sentC::J1ce, WE: heard submissions

of both counsel and we find that the 3ccused-appe.i::.n'~ wa~ 21 Y2a(5 of age at

the time of the incident and the deceased \Vas 45 y23~''; .:;Id married with a

child. After carefully considering all cii"CLl,l'lstar.ces, t:,;:; Court [mposes a

sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment to be ;rnplerr'l~nted fru;ll the date

of conviction namely, 19.12.2013. Considerir':g the ~;2Ct t;'~d~ tr.e dc;ceased was
