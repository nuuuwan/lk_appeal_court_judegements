The Accused Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the Appellant) was indicted

for the offence of rape punishable under Section 364(2) (e) of the Penal Code

and after the conclusion of the trial the Appellant was convicted and sentenced

to a term of 12 years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of Rs. 50,0001- in

default of which 6 months simple imprisonment was imposed. Further a sum of

Rs. 200,0001- was awarded as compensation to the prosecutrix.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant has taken up a preliminary objection

stating that the Appellant was denied representation in absentia which he

submits is contrary to Article 13(3) of the Constitution and Section 241(2) of

the Criminal Procedure Code Act. The Appellant contests the order of the

3

learned High Court judge dated 18.03.2005 refusing the Attorney-at-Law to

appear on behalf of the absconding accused and the subsequent judgment dated

16.05.2013.

As correctly submitted learned State Counsel the learned High Court Judge has

not refused the application made by the said Attorney-at-Law but has decided to

consider the application after issuing summons through the Interpol on the

overseas address indicated by the Appellant on the letter of authority given to

the said Attorney-at-Law since the authenticity of the document was in

question.

It is clear that the Appellant could have moved to revise the said order dated

18.03.2005 but did not do so. Trial commenced in the original Court on

17.10.2009 over four years since the above order was made and as submitted

by the learned Counsel for the State the Appellant failed to take the necessary

steps as prescribed by law to set aside and 1 or vary the said order.

The learned Counsel for the Appellant relies on the case of CA (PHC) APN

46/2011 in which Sis ira de Abrew J has deliberated on the right of an accused to

be represented in trial. It is clear however that the said case must be

distinguished from the instant appeal as the impugned order in the said case was

before the fmaljudgment of the case. The case bearing No. 240/2010 relied on

by the Appellant must also be distinguished from the instant application based

on facts. Further, I concur with the submissions of the learned Counsel for the

State that the learned High Court Judge has by order dated 18.03.2005

recognized the Appellants right to be represented by an Attorney-at-Law at trial.

This Court finds that the maXIm 'Vigilantibus Non Dormientibus Jura

Subveniunt" which means "the laws assist those who are vigilant, not those who

sleep over their rights" is applicable in the instant case and as such the said

preliminary objection is dismissed.
