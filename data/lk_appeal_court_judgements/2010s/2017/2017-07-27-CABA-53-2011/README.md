JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1

Learned counsel for all the Parties when this case came up on 2017-06-27

before us, agreed to have this case disposed of by way of written

submissions, They agreed that this Court could pronounce the judgment

after considering the said written submissions.

General Manager of Railways by letter dated 2007-04-04 marked X in the

appeal brief, has terminated all the agreements he had with the

Respondent - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant). The said letter has informed the Appellant that he should

hand over the possession of the premises mentioned therein.

As the Appellant had failed to respond to the said request, a quit notice

dated 2007-11-12 was issued on the Appellant, by the General Manager of

Railways in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession)

Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act). Thereafter the General

Manager of Railways had made an application under section 5 of the Act to

the Magistrate's Court of Colombo seeking an order to evict the Appellant

from the said premises. Learned Magistrate thereafter had afforded the

Appellant an opportunity to submit any valid permit or any other written

authority of the State he may have regarding his possession of the said

premises. As no such document was produced, learned Magistrate by his

order dated 2009-04-22, had made an order under section 10 (1) of the

Act evicting the Appellant forthwith from the said premises.

5

The High Court of Colombo upon an application for revision filed by the

Appellant has inquired into this case. The High Court after hearing parties,

had by its judgment dated 2011-03-21 affirmed the learned Magistrate's

order and had proceeded to dismiss the revision application.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this

Court.

Learned counsel for the Appellant in the course of his argument conceded

that the Appellant does not have any permit for the occupation of the said

premises. He sought to argue that some kind of prior authority had been

given to the Appellant by the Railways Department.

However as has been mentioned earlier, General Manager of Railways by

letter dated 2007-04-04, has terminated all the agreements he has had

with the Appellant and informed the Appellant to hand over the possession

of the premises. Thus it is proved that the Appellant has failed to establish

that he is in possession or occupation of the said premises upon any

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

and that such authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid as required by section 9 of the Act. What the document dated 2007-

04-04 (marked X), establishes is that all agreements with the Appellant

had been revoked.

Both the learned Magistrate as well as the High Court Judge have

considered in their judgments the submission made on behalf of the

Appellant that there exists an order to evict the Appellant in a case

previously filed. However the circumstances intervened thereafter had

somehow paved the way for the Appellant to continue in the premises. Be

that as it may, as it stands now, the General Manager of Railways by letter

dated 2007-04-04, has terminated all the agreements he has had with the

Appellant. Thus, the existence of a previous order of eviction is not a bar

for the maintenance of this case as has been held rightly both by the

Magistrate's Court and the High Court. In any case both the orders are to

the same effect, namely orders for eviction. Therefore there is no merit in

the submission on behalf of the Appellant regarding the application of the

principle of res judicata to these proceedings.

Section 9 of the Act which has specified the scope of the inquiry states that

the person on whom summons under section 6 has been served shall not

be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in the application under

section 5 except that such person may establish that he is in possession or

occupation of the said premises upon a valid permit or other written

authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law and that

such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid. The Appellant had failed to prove the requirements of the above

section.

This Court in the case of Muhandiram V Chairman, Janatha Estate

Development Board! had held that in an inquiry under State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, the onus is on the person summoned to

establish the basis of his possession or occupation.

The only basis such person could be permitted to possess or occupy such

land would be upon a valid permit or other written authority of the State

granted in accordance with any written law and that such permit or

authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered invalid2

This Court had further held in that case3 that if the above burden is not

discharged, the only option available for the Magistrate would be to make

an order of eviction.

I It is therefore the view of this Court that there is absolutely no merit in this

appeal.

Thus, this Court decides to dismiss this appeal with costs.

Appeal is dismissed with costs.
