This is an appeal filed by the IF substituted Defendant Petitioner appellant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) praying inter alia:

a) For a declaration that all the proceedings and step taken in Ratnapura D.C.

Case No. 5643/Land after 22.09.1994 are null and void and avail no force of

law.

b) For an order allowing him to appoint a new lawyer in place of his lawyer who

is dead and to take part and proceed with the case.

c) Cost and other reliefs that this court shall deem fit.

The prayers in the petition do not request that any specific order or Judgment made

by the learned District Judge should be vacated. However, the body of the Petition

of appeal reveals that the cause for the filing of this appeal is the dissatisfaction of

the Appellant with the decision dated 09.03.2000 made by the learned District

Judge of Rathnapura in case No. 5643/Land. By the said order the learned District

Judge rejected the application made by 16th Defendant-appellant who sought an

order from the District Court to suspend the execution of the writ in the aforesaid

case. However, the learned District Judge has ordered the execution of writ by the

said order.

When this matter was taken up for argument, the Plaintiff- Respondent raised a

preliminary objection stating that this appeal has been erroneously preferred by

the Appellant as a final appeal where she should have filed a leave to appeal

application. Therefore, the Plaintiff- Respondent argue that this appeal should be

dismissed in limine. The said objection was raised in terms of the sub sections

754(1), (2) and (5) of the civil procedure code.

Background to this appeal.

1. The Plaintiff Respondent instituted D.C. Case No. 5643/Land by a plaint dated

25.10.1982 against the original Defendant, namely M.D. Mohottihamy.

2. Mr. Nihal Wetttasinghe, Attorney-at-Law filed proxy on behalf of the

Defendant.

3. The Defendant field his answer dated 22.08.1983 appearing by his

Registered Attorney, the said Mr. Nihal Wettasinghe, AAL

4. Prior to the commencement of the trial before the learned District Judge, on

the 19th March 1987, it was informed to court that the original Defendant

had died. Hence 1A to 1H Defendants were substituted in place of the said

original Defendant.

5

5. As per the Journal Entry No. 27 dated 24.08.1987, the order Nisi had been

served on the 1A to 1H substituted Defendants but only 1A and 1C

substituted Defendants appeared in Courts but the other defendants,

namely 1B and 1D to 1H substituted Defendants were not present in courts

on that day. However, the same registered Attorney who represented the

original Defendant filed proxy on behalf of all the substituted Defendants.

Thus, they were represented in Court by the said registef:a.ttorney.

" /"0 6. However, it was informed to court on 22.09.1994 (vide J.E. 56 at page 32)

that the said Registered Attorney of the Substituted Defendants, Mr. Nihal

Wettasinghe had passed away. On the said date none of the substituted

Defendants was present in court but, one Mr. Hennayaka AAL has informed

court that he would be tendering proxy on behalf of the Substituted

Defendants on the next date which he never did.

7. No notice was served on any of the substituted Defendants as required by

Section 28 of the Civil Procedure Code.

8. Thereafter, Mr. P. Bamunuarachchi Attorney-at-Law filed proxy on behalf of

the 1A substituted Defendant (vide lE. No. 57 at page 32 and the proxy filed

by the said Attorney-at-Law) and other Substituted Defendants were not

represented by any Attorney-at-Law.

9. Thereafter, when the case was taken up for trial on 12.12.1996, the

Attorney-at-Law Mr. Bamunuarachchi informed Court that he has no

instruction from the Defendants. As per the type written proceedings of

12.12.1996, the learned District Judge has decided to proceed exparte

against the Defendant (UeJZS;25)2lS)6lC) eJ~c{w[) e)2lS)e!lJ2:Sfi2lS)[) eJIDJeDc.:lC) eD~"}

However, in his exparte Judgement he has decided against the Defendants

6

but in favour of the Plaintiff. ((( .... o1.@&(3:m61.@aJ DoS",C) BZ5fi51:m~D25fC)

6@683D @@@ 25)~D i5125f~ :m6@." )

10. The decree entered on the first instance was amended to include all the

Defendants and it was served on the la, lc, Id, le, Ig and Ih substituted

Defendants and later on it was served on Ib and 1f Substituted Defendants

by substituted service.

11. lA substituted Defendant filed a Petition dated 06.10.1999 to get the

exparte order vacated but after an inquiry the learned District Judge

dismissed the said petition and affirmed the said exparte Judgement.

Thereafter, a writ of execution was granted by the Learned District Judge.

12. Therefore, IF substituted Defendant (the Appellant) filed a Petition dated

06.10.1999 along with an affidavit to object to the writ of execution and

prayed inter alia for;

a) Vacation of the exparte Decree entered already and annulment of

proceedings from 22.09.1994 onwards, i.e. the date on which it

transpired that the Registered Attorney of the IF substituted Defendant

had passed away.

b) A declaration that the IF substituted Defendant is not bound by the said

Judgment and Decree already delivered and entered.

c) Recall the writ of execution issued to the Fiscal until her application is

decided.

13. The learned District Judge thereafter by order dated 09.03.2000 refused to

grant the reliefs prayed for by the IF substituted Defendant and the Fiscal

was ordered to execute the writ.

7

14. Thereafter the iF Substituted Defendant has preferred this appeal to this

Court.

The Plaintiff- Respondent's position is that the appellant cannot maintain this

appeal as he has preferred this as a direct appeal against an interlocutory order

without filing a leave to appeal application as required by law.

As per the Petition dated 06.10.1999 filed by the iF Substituted Defendant

Appellant in the District Court, one of the prayers was for a declaration that he is

not bound by the Judgment and decree entered in the district court case.

Therefore, the application of the iF Defendant appellant in the District Court case

appears to be incidental to the purported Judgment of that case. Other prayers

were to get the proceedings in D.C. Case from 22.09.1994 onwards vacated and to

recall the writ of possession. If the learned District Judge granted those reliefs,

the District Court would have to go on with the action, from the point of time when

the death of the Attorney-at-law occu rred, to decide the rights of the pa rties.

Therefore, the order made by the learned District Judge on the aforesaid

application of the iF Defendant-Appellant is an interlocutory order and it is not a

Judgment as contemplated by Section 754(1) of the Civil Procedure Code.

As per the Section 754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code, 'Judgment' means any

Cl. judgment or order having the effect of final judgment made by any civil Court and

" as per the Section 754(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, one who is dissatisfied with

any other order which does not fall within the category of Judgment, can prefer an

appeal only with leave of this Court first had and obtained.

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff -Respondent has brought this court's

attention to the decisions in Siriwardana Vs Air Ceylon {1984} 1 SLR 286, Ranjith Vs

Karunawathie {1998} 3 SLR 232, and Dona Padma Priyanthi Senanayake Vs. H.G.

Chamika Jayantha and two others S.c. Appeal No. 41/2015, and SC/CHC Appeal

37/2008.

The aforementioned Dona Padma Priyanthi Senanayake Vs. H.G. Chamika Jayantha

and two others was decided by a bench comprising of 7 Judges of the Supreme

Court. In that Judgment his Lordship the Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, PC concludes

as follows;

"In order to decide whether an order is a final Judgement or not it is my

considered view that the proper approach is the approach adopted by Lord Escher

in Salaman Vs Warner (Supra) which was cited with approval by Lord Denning in

Salter Rex Vs Gosh (Supra). It stated;

"If the decision whichever way it is given, will if it stands finally dispose of the

matter in dispute, I think that for the purpose of these rules it is final. On the

other hand, if their decision if given one way, will dispose the matter in dispute,

but if given in the other, will allow the action to go on, then I think it is not final,

but interlocutory"

As mentioned before if the application relevant to this appeal was decided in favour

of the appellant it would have allowed the action to go on.

Therefore, it is my considered view that the order relevant to this appeal is an

interlocutory order. Thus, the preliminary objection has substance. There was no

right for a direct appeal to be lodged in this court but in his written submissions the

counsel for the appellant argue that this a suitable case to here and determine

9

exercising revisionary jurisdiction. Section 753 of the Civil procedure Code

describing the revisionary powers states as follows;

flThe court of appeal, 0/ its own motion or an any application made, ....................... .

and may upon revision of the case brought before it passes any

judgment or make any order thereon, as the interest of the justice may require".

In AG Vs Gunawardena (1996) 2 SCR 149, it was held that in exercising powers of

revision the Appellate Court is not trammeled by technical rules of pleadings and

procedure. In doing so the Court has power to act whether it is set in motion by a

party or not and even ex mero motu."

It appears this Court has power to exercise revisionary jurisdiction even of its own

motion where it sees a miscarriage of justice. As per the incidents that have taken

place before the learned District Judge, it appears that the learned District Judge

has not served notices on the Substituted Defendants after the death of their

registered Attorney. Only one of the Substituted Defendants has filed a proxy

thereafter. In that situation, as per the said section 28, it appears that no further

proceedings should have taken place against the other Substituted Defendants

without giving notices of the death of their registered attorney. In such a situation

one can argue that the learned District Judge entered the exparte Judgment against

the other Defendants without Jurisdiction and therefore judgment is a nullity

against them. However before making any order on such grounds, this Court must

give an opportunity to the Plaintiff- Respondent to make submissions on whether

this court should act in revision in this matter as the Plaintiff- Respondent did not

~ have any opportunity to reply the Defendant- appellant's written Submissions ,...

which moves this court to exercise its power of revisionary jurisdiction.

Therefore, this Court decides that the iF Defendant- Appellants could not have

filed a direct appeal based on the order dated 09.03.2000 made by the learned

District judge but before making a final decision on this matter this court gives an

opportunity to the Plaintiff- Respondent to make further submissions on why this

Court shall not act in revision on the facts revealed before this court.

I agree.
