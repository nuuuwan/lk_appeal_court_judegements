order of the Agrarian Tribunal is marked P5. The Petitioner and the 1 st Respondent

gave evidence at the said inquiry.

After the death of Petitioner's mother, the 1st Respondent filed an

application in terms of Section 10 (1) of the said Act, claiming arrears of rent to

the said paddy land from the Petitioner. According to the settlement reached by the

parties at the inquiry to this application, the 1 st Respondent was accepted as the

Landlord and the Petitioner as the Cultivator and the said Petitioner agreed to pay

all arrears of rental in respect of the said paddy land to the 1 st Respondent.

However the Petitioner has defaulted the payment of installments due on rental as

agreed in the settlement. The Petitioners stand on this issue was that, the 1 st

Respondent was deliberately avoiding to accept the due rentals. However, the 1 st

Respondent categorically denies the said assertion.

Due to the said default in payment of rentals, the Assistant Commissioner

of Agrarian Development Hambantota (3rd Respondent) by letter dated

17/06/2016, marked "P8B", has informed the Petitioner that in terms of Section 10

(2) of the said Act, the tenancy rights of the Petitioner has ceased and therefore,

the Petitioner should vacate the said paddy land and hand over possession of the

said land to the 1 st Respondent, failing in which legal action was to follow in terms

of Section 8 of the said Act to evict the Petitioner.

The Petitioner submits that at no time was the 15t Respondent declared as

the Landlord nor the Petitioner declared the Tenant Cultivator of the said paddy

land and therefore the inquiry held under Section 10 (1) of the said Act is void ab

initio. The Petitioner has cited the Judgement of Madduma Bandarage Dona

Sirilina Karunaratne Meegoda, and D. Jayasinghe, reported at 79 (1) NLR 233,

in support.

The 1 st Respondent in the limited objections filed of record, state that,

according to PIO, the Petitioner has admitted that the 1st Respondent is the

Landlord of the said paddy land and the Petitioner as the Tenant Cultivator at the

inquiry held by the Assistant Commissioner of Agrarian Services. At the said

hearing the 1 st Respondent as the Landlord and the Petitioner as the Tenant

Cultivator were heard in person.

In paragraph 01 of P 10, the Petitioner states,

In the circumstances it is very clear that the Petitioner has admitted the

rental due to the 1 sl Respondent in respect of the said paddy land.

The 1 sl Respondent has also drawn attention of Court to two Mortgage

Bonds marked lRl and lR2. By the said Mortgage Bonds, the Petitioner has

raised loans by mortgaging the said paddy land to a third party. The fact that the

said land was mortgaged by the Petitioner to a 3rd party, was not disclosed at the

inquiry held by the Agrarian Officer, the Petitioner has also failed to disclose the

said agreements to Court. It is observed that the Petitioner has failed to make

material disclosure of all the relevant facts and thereby has failed to show the

required care in a judicial review claim.

In all the above circumstances notice to the Respondents are refused and

the Petition is dismissed without costs.
