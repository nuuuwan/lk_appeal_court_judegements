T

he Officer in Charge of the Police station, Kopay,the Complainant,Respondent,

Respondent in this case, filed information in the Primary Court of j affna under

Section 66(1) of the Primary Court Procedure Act No.44 of 1979. As Section 75 of the

Primary Court Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 define it, the expression "dispute affecting

land" includes inter alia any dispute as to the right of possession of any land or part of a

land and building thereon. The dispute between parties in the case was one that

affected the right of possession of Maha Kanapathi Pillaiyar Temple in Kondavil and the

2

information by the Police had been filed before the Primary Court of J affna on 11th

September 2002. The parties brought forward as the 1st Party Respondents by Police

were 16 persons, whilst the 2nd Party Respondent was one Shanmugasundara Kurukkal

Sriskandaraja Kurukkal of Kondavil West, Kondavil. The 2nd Party Respondent who has

since become the Appellant before this Court averred in his affidavit before the Primary

Court the following:-

a) The dispute pertained to possession of Maha Kanapathi Pillaiyar temple and the

land in Kondavil West and;

b) The 2nd Party Respondent had become the Kurukkal of the said temple through

succession from his ancestors who had successively held that office for

generations in the past;

c) During an interregnum between 1983 and 1989, the 2nd Party Respondent was in

Singapore and upon his return to the country in 1989, he once again functioned

as the Poosari of the temple continuously,

d) A document chronicling the ancestral administration of the temple was marked

and produced as R2;

e) Upon his return from Singapore he had taken over the administration of the

temple as the Chief Priest.

The Appellant (the 2nd Party-Respondent-Respondent-Appellant or the Poosari or

Kurukkal as he is referred to in the course of this judgment) averred further in his

affidavit that since the temple premises had gone to rack and ruin, he appointed a

group of nine members to oversee the ritual rites that were taking place in the temple

but the Appellant emphasized that despite the constitution of this committee he

continued to be in total control of the administration of the temple and more over the

keys to the temple were in his custody. Thus the evidence before the learned Primary

Court Judge was that the Appellant had the possession of the temple premises. He

claimed long possession of the temple by his ancestors and an assertion was made that

3

it was his paternal grandfather who had built a small temple on his land and later

expanded it~see para 4 of his affidavit dated 8th January 2003. It is in paragraphs 14 and

IS of the affidavit that he alleges as to how his dispossession from the temple premises

took place.

On Sth September 2002, one Ramalingam Nadaraja who features as the 1st Party

Respondent in the information filed before the Primary Court having come in a three~

wheeler with four other persons, broke open the door and forcibly entered the temple

premises. Having thus made an illegal entry he made off with Rs.13,SO,OOO/~ worth of

jewelry and cash. This allegation is not contradicted by any of the affidavits filed by the

Respondents. In fact Ramalingam Nadaraja who is referred to by name in the affidavit

of the Appellant is one of those who have sworn one of the affidavits but there is nary a

denial of this allegation of threats at the Appellant and the forcible dispossession. Such

silence as we encounter in the affidavits dated 8th January 2003 must be deemed to be

an admission. In light of the failure on the part of the Respondents to respond to the

specific allegation of the Appellant, I take the view that such failure in the affidavit

evidence would amount to an admission. Silence in court may be used to strengthen

inferences from opposing evidence.l

According to the Appellant (the Kurukkal or Poosari of the temple), it was on sth

September 2002 that the 1st Party Respondent along with his confederates forcibly

evicted the Appellant from the Kovil, having threatened first to put him to death. At

this stage I would briefly refer to the documents tendered by the Appellant along with

his affidavit. One document 2Rl described the hereditary succession of the Appellant~

(see page 159 of the brief). This is drawn in the form of a pedigree.

In another printed document marked as 2R2, a history of a succession of priests for

generations is chronicled and among those who had performed services as Kurukkal of

the temple~(see page 160 of the brief), the name of the Appellant figures corroborating his

1 See J.D. Heydon, Silence as evidence 1 Monash University Law Review S3 (1974).

4

\.

version in his affidavit that he had been officiating as the chief priest at the temple. The

overall contention of the 2nd party Respondent (the Appellant in this Court) before the

Primary Court was that he had been in full control and physical possession of the said

temple as the Kurukkal performing all pooja ceremonies in the temple and he had been

maintaining and administering the properties of the temple prior to his forcible

dispossession on 5th September 2002. The Appellant prayed that he be restored to

possession until such time as the Respondents obtained a suitable order in a District

Court.

In response to the affidavits filed by the 2nd Party Respondent~Respondent~Appellant,

the 1st Party~Respondents~Respondents (the Respondents in this Court) filed two

separate statements of claim (two separate affidavits) admitting inter alia that since

1998 the Appellant had been functioning as the Kurukkal of the said temple~see

paragraph 4 of the affidavit dated 8th January 2003 of Respondents who were 11 in

number. The other affidavit of 5 other Respondents bears the same date and admits

that the Appellant had been functioning as the priest of the temple. But the 2nd, 3rd, 5th

and th Respondents before the Primary Court admitted in their affidavit that they had

placed a new priest in place to perform religious ceremonies as they had found the

Appellant intransigent. One of the affidavits filed speaks of how the religiOUS

performances came to a halt as a result of the recalcitrant behavior of the priest.

In fact the Respondents filed documents to show intransigency on the part of the

Appellant. They attached MI~a letter dated 20.12.1993 addressed by Deputy Director,

Department of Hindu Cultural Affairs, that only speaks of the registration of the temple

but this is not a document acknowledging that the Respondents were the trustees of

the temple. There is also a letter addressed by the Divisional Secretary, Nallur to the

Appellant wherein he was instructed to hand over the keys to a till and stores to the

then administrative body and in the same letter, the Divisional Secretary requested the

Appellant to co~operate with the administrative body to conduct the ceremonies~see

letter dated 22.08.2011.

5

\.

By A3 dated 22.01.2002, the Additional Government Agent, Jaffna writes to the

Administrative body of the temple and laments that the interim administration that he

established had resulted in a failure as the Appellant had not been cooperative enough.

Therefore, the Additional Government Agent, J affna advised the administrative body or

the Board of Management to seek legal redress, if any.

But in September 2002, the Appellant was evicted and a new Poosari was put in place.

No doubt all this correspondence shows that there had been constant quarrels between

the Appellant and the administrative body but no legal remedy was sought. Instead the

temple was forced open on 05.09.2002 and possession of the temple taken over. So, it

has to be reiterated that there had been a concession on the part of the Respondents of

the allegation that they had dispossessed the appellant from the temple.

But does this alleged behavior of the Appellant authorize the Respondents to deal with

him so hastily and summarily? What is the instrument that empowers the Respondents

to mete out palm tree justice to a priest, however intransigent he was? When were the

Respondents appointed trustees of the temple? None of these items of evidence were

available before both the Primary Court and High Court. Perhaps these were matters

that were competent to be adjudicated upon in a civil suit and in the absence of such

evidence the learned High Court Judge could not have concluded that the Appellant

was standing in the shoes of an agent of an administrative body. The underlying tenor

of the judgment of the High Court certainly indicates the nexus of an agency by

implication, if not expressly.

Whichever claim that was contending for supremacy was true, one thing stands as

plain as a pikestaff. The Appellant had been the Kurukkal or the priest officiating at the

temple and the affidavit evidence of the Respondents itself establishes dispossession of

the Appellant.

The Respondents in their respective affidavits though took an interesting argument

that the complaint made by the Appellant could not be investigated as a dispute

affecting land under Section 66 of the Primary Court Act No.44 of 1979 (hereinafter

6

..

.:

sometimes referred to as the "Act") since there was no breach of the peace. The

Respondents also contended before the learned Magistrate that Section 32(2) of the

Judicature Act prohibits the Primary Court from assuming jurisdiction in respect of

matters set out in the 4th schedule and items 11 and 12 therein such as relating to trust

and declaratory actions for title to land and in the circumstances the application must

be dismissed. The learned Primary Court Judge made short shrift of the argument of the

jurisdictional bar and held that he had jurisdiction. The learned Magistrate of Jaffna

proceeded to hold that prior to the forcible dispossession of the Appellant, he had been

in exclusive physical possession of the temple, its premises and administration and

accordingly by his order dated 2nd April 2003 the learned Magistrate declared that the

Appellant who had been dispossessed be restored to possession and in addition the

learned Judge made consequential orders placing an embargo on all disruption and

disturbance to the peaceable possession of the Appellant, otherwise than through the

authority of a legal order (see the order dated 2nd April 2003). Consequently, by a writ of

execution issued by the learned Magistrate of Jaffna, the Appellant was restored to

possession of the temple premises. I have no reason to disturb this finding and

determinations.

Revisionary Application to the High Court

In a Revisionary Application made to the High Court ofJaffna, the Respondents in the

prayer of their Petition dated 08.04.2003 reiterated that the Primary Court Judge had

no jurisdiction whatsoever to make a determination in respect of this dispute and upon

a perusal of the reliefs sought in the petition the Respondents sought from the High

Court, it would appear that the only relief that had been prayed for was to have the

order of the learned Magistrate set aside on the basis that the Primary Court had no

jurisdiction to inquire into this matter. By an order dated 14th October 2003, the learned

High Court Judge rejected the submissions on the jurisdictional bar raised by the

Respondents and concluded that the 4th Schedule to the Judicature Act did not

preclude the Primary Court Judge from making a determination in respect of

possession of the temple, its land and administration and in any event the learned High

7

l

Court Judge proceeded to hold that any title or rights relating to the temple had to be

adjudicated upon only in an appropriate District Court and not in the Primary Court.

No argument was made before us against this conclusion and in the circumstances one

need not go into the propriety of the order pertaining to jurisdiction as the issue raised

before the Primary Court was one that turned on dispossession and recovery of

possession and indisputably the Court was clothed with jurisdiction to investigate and

adjudicate upon those questions.

The learned High Court Judge proceeded to hold in the end that since the temple and

its properties are always vested in the administrative body of a temple, the said body

enjoys the power to remove a priest at any time and merely because the Kurukkal had

custody of the keys he could not be said to have possession within the meaning of Section

68(3) of Primary Court Act No. 44 of 1979. The learned High Court Judge further held

that though the Kurukkal was in possession of the keys to the temple, the continuous

possession of the temple lay with the administrative body. A Kurukkal could not claim

possession of a temple. It was only for ritualistic rites that the keys of the temple had

been handed over to the Kurukkal or the priest. The learned High Court Judge further

concluded that in order to vindicate his rights to continue to perform pooja, the

Appellant must institute action in the District Court. Merely because the keys of the

temple were in his custody, that fact cannot be interpreted to invest the Appellant with

possession of the temple.

The learned High Court Judge also compared the capacity of the Appellant as a Poosari

or Kurukkal to that of a Manager of a Bank Branch. The learned High Court Judge made

a few assumptions in regard to the manager of a Bank. He stated that the manager of a

Bank branch would have the keys to the branch as well as the safety lockers containing

cash. The learned High Court Judge stated in his order under impingement that on no

account could the possession of the keys of the contents of a bank branch as above be

regarded as possession within Section 66 of the Primary Court Act. He further drew an

analogy that merely because a Manager of a Hotel had administrative functions, it

8

would not lie in his mouth to contend that he had possession vis~a~vis the

administration of the hotel. In the view of the learned High Court Judge the respective

positions of a Branch Manager of a Bank or a Manager of a Hotel would be comparable

to that of the Appellant.

In the circumstances the learned Judge of the High Court of J affna summed it up in two

important conclusions;

i. the Primary Court Judge had jurisdiction to inquire into this dispute under

Section 66 of the Primary Court Act No.44 of 1979,

ii. it was unfortunate that the learned Primary Court Judge restored the Appellant

back to possession of the temple merely because the Appellant had custody of

the keys to the temple.

Accordingly the learned High Court Judge by his order dated 14th October 2003 set

aside order made by learned Primary Court Judge and handed over possession to the

Respondents. It is against this order of the learned High Court Judge of the High Court

of J affna that the Appellant has preferred this appeal to this Court. Thus, it was

contended by the learned Counsel for the Appellant that it was never the contention of

the Respondents before the learned High Court Judge that the possession of the temple

must be handed to the Respondents, whilst the Appellant had already been placed in

possession by the learned Magistrate. The Counsel argued that their only prayer before

the learned High Court Judge in their Petition dated 18.04.2003 was to secure an order

from the High Court of Jaffna that the learned Primary Court Judge had no jurisdiction

to inquire into this matter. In other words, the argument was that the learned High

Court Judge had given a relief of repossession to the Respondents though this relief had

not been sought at all by the Respondents.

If one were to understand this argument, one is driven to the complaint that is usually

made namely the learned High Court Judge has given a relief of repossession to the

Respondents who were the spoliators, whatever right they may have claimed to have

possessed in regard to the temple. In other words it was a grant of a remedy that had

9

not been sought before him. Having held that the learned Primary Court Judge had

jurisdiction over the matter, the learned High Court Judge could not have gone further

and placed out of possession a Kurrukal who had been quited in possession by the

learned Primary Court Judge. This was the submission of Mr. U. Abdul Najeem~the

Counsel for the Appellant. Mr. Mandaleswaran for the Respondents contended that it

was well within the right of the learned High Court Judge to have engaged in this

exercise. The possession of the Kurukkal reflected the possession of the administrative

body.

Let me appraise these respective arguments raised on behalf of the Appellant and

Respondents.

This Court is thus confronted with two orders which are diametrically diverse to each

other as regards possession. In the opinion of the learned Primary Court Judge, the

Appellant had been forcibly dispossessed by the Respondents within a period of two

months immediately before the date on which the information was filed under Section

66 of the Primary Court Act and his determination was that the Kurukkal must be

restored to possession. But the learned High Court Judge arrived at a conclusion that

the Kurukkal did not have possession at all.

The possession of the Kurukkal was akin to that of a Branch Manager of a Bank or a

Hotel Manager and the tenor of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge appears

to be that such possession as the Kurukkal had in the temple does not qualify to be

possession within the meaning of Section 68(3) of the Primary Court Act No.44 of 1979.

To that extent the judgment of the High Court concludes that possession must be

handed back to the administrative body.

What does one make of the possession held by the priest? Did that exist in vacuo? If

possession on the part of the priest was non est to qualify to be possession within the

meaning of Section 68(3) of the Primary Court Act No.44 of 1979, what kind of

possession proprio vigore is necessary so as to be invested with the attributes of

10

possession required in Section 68 (3) of the Act? There is sparse discussion by the

learned High Court judge on this requirement.

Does the possession of the Poosari or Kurukkal satisfy the requisites for possession

in Section 68?

A slew of case law throws light on the kind of possession that would suffice for

purposes of Section 68. Before I look at them, let me reiterate that there is nothing in

the two affidavits of the Respondents to suggest that they had some kind of right to

summarily put out a priest. What was it that gave them power? Did they appoint him

as a priest? If so can they proceed to throw him out in the way he was ousted? This is

not made clear more unambiguously in the two sets of affidavits filed by the

Respondents and these questions become more pronounced in light of the fact that an

administrative body was written to by the Additional Government Agent on 22nd

January 2002 to seek legal relief. If this was the advice of the Additional Government

Agent, why was violence resorted to in the dispossession of the priest? It is the

Respondents who produced the above letter to the Primary Court Judge along with

their affidavits and it shows that they were in the know of what had to be done legally,

regardless of the fact whether the Respondents were in fact members of the

administrative body or not.

The forcible dispossession as I have commented above is abundantly clear from the

affidavit evidence of the Respondents. They admit in the affidavit that having broken

open the closed door of the temple on the 5th of September 2002, they secured the

temple with new locks and took away the possession from the Appellant.

There are several determinations that a Primary Court Judge has to make at the

conclusion of an inquiry into a dispute relating to the right of the possession of any

land or any part of a land. Firstly he must make a determination as to who was in

possession of a land or any part thereof on the day the information was filed. Secondly

he must make order as to who is entitled to possession of such land or part thereof. In

regard to the determination of the second question he must be satisfied that a

11

particular person who had been in possession of the land or part thereof has been forcibly

dispossessed within a period of two months before the date on which the information

was filed under Section 66 of the Act. It is the possession of the dispossessed person

that comes into play and it is crystal clear that it was this Kurukkal or Appellant who

had been in possession of the temple premises with the period of two months

preceding the date on which the information was filed.

The reason why the learned High Court Judge overturned the determination of the

Primary Court Judge appears to be that the possession of the Appellant cannot be

equated to an exclusive possession and in engaging in the exercise of equiparating the

possession of the Appellant to that of a Bank Manager or a Hotel Manager the High

Court was laboring under an impression, as misconceived as it was, that it was the

Respondents who had possession. The Respondents did not claim possession in their

affidavits nor is it clear upon a perusal of their affidavits by what right they could claim

such possession as would give them right to put the appellant out of possession

summarily.

I cannot not but discountenance the approach taken by the High Court Judge to the

possession enjoyed by the Appellant. Sri Lankan case law on possessory actions have

recognized possession of the office holders qua the Appellant.

ChangarapilJai v. CheUiaJi was one such case where a possessory action in which the

Plaintiff was, as the District Judge found, the Manager of a Hindu Temple and its

property. Bonser C.J. and Wendt]. were of opinion that if the Plaintiff, who was called

the Manager, had control of the fabric of the temple and of the property belonging to it,

his possession was such as to entitle him to maintain the action. The case was sent

back for evidence as to the exact nature of the plaintiff's interest.

Bonser c.]. expressly stated that control of the temple and its property was sufficient

to enable the Plaintiff to maintain the action, even though he made no pretence of

claiming the beneficial interest of the temple or its property, but was only a trustee for

2 (1902) 5 N.L.R. 270

12

the congregation who worshipped there. Bonser D.J. distinguished the previous case of

Tissera v. Costa3 on the facts: "The muppu who appears to be kind of beadle, has no

control over the fabric of the church, and was only a caretaker entrusted with the

custody of certain movables, a vey subordinate servant, whose duty is was to keep the

church clean, but who had no sort or kind of possession either on behalf of himself or

anybodyelse".4

This approach was emphatically endorsed by Pulle, J. (with Swan, J. agreeing) in

Sameem v. Dep~

The facta probanda of possessory actions have received definition by the South African

courts. In Scholtz v. Faife? Innes C.J. said: "A person who applies for such relief must satiSfy

the Court upon two points: that he was in possession of the (property) at the date of the alleged

deprivation; and that he was illicitly ousted form such possession.7" In Burnham v. Neumeye/

Bristowe J. stated the essential requisites as follows: "that the things alleged to have been

spoliated were in the plaintiff's possession, and that they were removed from his possession forcibly or

wrongfully or against his consent".9

Scholtz v. Faifelo is an illuminative case in this regard. The appellant, who had

contracted to erect certain buildings for the respondent on condition that the latter

supplied the materials and paid for the work as it progressed every two weeks, applied

for an order reinstating him in possession of the building then partially erected. The

Appellant alleged that the Respondent had unlawfully taken possession of the partly

constructed building and placed another contractor in charge of the work.

One of the questions which arose was whether the Appellant had sufficient physical

control or detentio of the building, to be declared entitled to possessory relief.

It was accepted that when the house had advanced so far towards completion that the

doors are placed in position, it may be locked up and possession of the key would be

equivalent to possession of the bUilding.lO The position in regard to a partially

constructed building is obviously more difficult.

Innes C.]. said in the course of his judgment: "Mere temporary absence (of the contractor) for a

short time would not destroy the physical element which is necessary to constitute possession. Take the

extreme case where a builder goes away every night; he still has the detention of the work which he is in

course of erecting. If it existed originally, he still has it; mere absence at night does not deprive him of it.

But where work is suspended for a considerable time, then it seems to me that if the builder desires to

preserve his possession he must take some special step, such as placing a representative in charge of the

work, or putting a hoarding round it; or doing something to enforce his right to its physical control. Ifhe

chooses to leave the work derelict, then, no matter what his intention may be, the physical element is

absent, and he loses possession, even though he may say he intended to resume it or never intended to

abandon it".l1

Leaving aside these cases which were decided on possessory actions, I would observe

that the purpose and intendment of relief under Section 66 of the Primary Court

Procedure Act No.44 of 1979 are to accord protection against forcible dispossession at

the hands of a spoliator and this right must be available to a priest of a temple who has

been officiating at ceremonies. If he is found to be intractable, he must be dealt with in

accordance with the law and the established rules and regulations pertaining to the

affairs of the temple.

In Wilsnach v. Van der Westhuizen and HaalP Buchanan A.C.J, observed: "The whole

foundation of the rule for the restoration of property taken possession of in this way is that a spoliator

is not entitled to take the law into his own hands, and a person who has taken the law into his own hands

must restore the property, and establish his right thereto in a peaceable matter in a court of law. "

Sohoni in his treatise on the Indian Criminal Procedure at page 1331 describes that

the proviso to Section 14 5( 4) of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code which could boast

of parentage over its Sri Lankan counterpart in Section 66 of the Primary Procedure Act

No.44 of 1979 is founded on the principle that forcible and wrongful dispossession is

not to be recognized under the Criminal Law. The word "dispossessed" means to be out

of possession, removed from the premises, ousted, ejected or excluded. Even where a

person has a right to possession, he cannot do so by taking the law into his hand. That

will make it a forcible entry otherwise than in due course of law. It would be a case of

both forcible and wrongful dispossession.

In the case of P.K Anita v. Shridhar Sadashi,P it has been held that: 'The words forcibly

and wrongfully' qualifying the word 'dispossession' in the proviso to section 145(4), cannot be given a

restricted meaning of dispossession accompanied by the use of criminal force. To constitute forcible

dispossession, even the use of misrepresentation and improper threats would make the dispossession

forcible and wrongful"'.

In the case of Bhuttani v. Desai,)4 Dharam Chand v. Statt!5 and Thrulatha Devi v.

Misri6, it has been held that, even where a person has a right to possession, but taking

the law into his hands, makes a forcible entry otherwise than in the due course of the

law. It would be a case of both forcible and wrongful dispossession. The Magistrate

will be entitled to dislodge a person who thus secured possession.

The phrase 'forcible dispossession' does not contemplate a fugitive act of trespass or

interference with possession. The dispossession referred to, is one that amounts to a

completed act of forcible and wrongful driving out party from his possession-see

Bhuttani v. Desal~

131982, Cri.l.J. 1463 (Bom. H.C.)

Therefore when violence was resorted to in order to deprive the Appellant on

05.09.2002, in my view it was forcible dispossession of the Poosari or the Kurukkal.

In fact U.D.Z. Gunawardana, J. in Iqbal v. Majedudeen and Others9 took the view

that the words "forcibly dispossessed" in Section 68(3) of the Primary Court Act No.44

of 1979 as amended means that dispossession had taken place against the will of the

person entitled to possess and without authority of the Law.

In the course of the judgment the learned Judge acknowledged possession to be of two

kinds.

1. When a person has direct physical control over a thing at a given time-actual

possession.

2. When he is not in actual possession he may have both a power and intention at a

given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing either directly or through

another person-constructive possession.

In Black's law Dictionary, 9th Edition the term constructive possession is defined as

control or dominion over a property without actual possession or custody of it. There is

no affidavit evidence that the Respondents had control or dominion over the temple.

No instrument was before the Primary Court to indicate a vesting of such control.

Therefore it cannot be contended that the Respondents had constructive possession.

Even if they had had constructive possession, it could not be argued that their

possession was disturbed when they themselves caused the disturbance.

Rather it was the Appellant who had actual possession and he was forcibly

dispossessed

Whichever may be the kind of possession it is dispossession of a person that is frowned

upon by law. Such dispossession as is frowned upon by the Primary Court Procedure

Act would not enjoy the imprimatur or the authority of the law. No doubt there might

have been an administrative body to oversee the functioning of the temple as it is

19 1993 Sri LR p.213

16

evident by the document marked as A3. But they cannot seek self help and put out of

possession someone holding the position of a Kurukkal in a summary and precipitate

manner.

In the case of Moolchand v. State of Madya Pradesh19 the Court held that the relevant

section strictly limits even the violence self~help by the true owner of the premises. On

the other hand, it seeks to maintain, if necessary and if justified under this provision of

the section, the possession of even a wrong~doer, the prime consideration being the

prevention of the breach of the peace by declaring one party to be entitled to

possession, until evicted by due course of the law.

In proceedings under this section the Magistrate is not required to investigate the title

of the disputed land or the rights of the administrative body. In fact, he can use the

evidence of title merely to guide and aid his mind in coming to a decision upon the

question of possession, but he is precluded from deciding questions of title alone.

The learned High Court Judge fell into an error by implying an agency into the

relationship between the Appellant and the Respondents. In fact the evidence is to the

contrary~namely the actual possession of the temple was with the Appellant and in the

circumstances the learned High Court Judge need not have gone on a voyage of

discovery to compare the possession of the Appellant to that of a Bank Manager or a

Manager of a Hotel. In fact, there is no evidence, so to speak, to establish that the

Respondents had actual possession of this temple. It was the Appellant who had been

in possession of the temple premises by virtue of the fact that his presence therein was

necessitated by his functions and the fact that the key to the temple had been in his

custody at the relevant time of dispossession connotes actual possession of the temple

premises on the part of the Appellant.

The fact that the Respondents may have labored under the impression that the

Appellant was their agent is not borne out at all by evidence and any purported notion

that the learned Judge entertained as to the duty of a Poosari under the control of an

administrative body is not supported by evidence. In any event even if by some stretch of

imagination that he should be at the back and call of the Respondents, it does not authorize them

to disturb his possession and deprive him of his possession.

In the case of Bibihusna v. Abdul Rashid,20it was held that a Criminal Court will have

to maintain the possession of even a trespasser, if he is found to be in actual possession

for more than two months before the date of preliminary order.

An identical view was articulated by Sharvananda, J. (as His Lordships then was) in

the case of Ramalingam v. Thangaraja21, "under section 68 the Judge is bound to

maintain the possession of such person if he be rank trespasser as against any

interference even by the rightful owner". This section, entitles even a squatter to the

protection of the Law, until his possession was acquired within two months of the

filing of the information.

The above position had been expressed by the Indian decision Sohan Mushar v.

KaUiash Singh,22 wherein Raj Kishor Prasad, J. voiced the opinion that "the possession

contemplated in this section is the 'actual possession' of the subject of the dispute.

Actual physical possession means the possession of the person who has his feet on the

land, who is ploughing it, sowing or growing crops in it entirely irrespective of whether

he has any right or title to possess it. But 'actual possession', irrespective of whether he

has any right or title to possess it. But, "actual possession" does not always mean

"actual physical possession". For example, if there is a tenant occupying a house and

there is a dispute between two persons, each claiming to be the landlord, admittedly

neither is in actual physical possession, still proceedings under section 145 of the Code

will lie, and in such a case, the decision will rest upon who is in 'actual possession' by

realization of rent from the tenant. "Actual possession" postulated by Sub section (1) of

Section 145, however, is not the same as a 'right to possession' nor does it necessarily

mean lawful or legal possession. It includes even the possession of a mere trespasser.

It should, however be real and tangible, that is, there should be effective occupation

and control over the property."

Thus in light of the above the learned High Court Judge was in error when he

misdirected himself on the facts and law and made order directing the handing over of

the temple back to the Respondents. In the circumstances I set aside the order of the

learned High Court Judge dated 14.10.2003 and allow the appeal with costs.

M.M.A. Gaffoor,j.

I agree.
