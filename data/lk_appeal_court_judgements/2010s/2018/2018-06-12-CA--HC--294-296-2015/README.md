CA294-296/2015 JUDGMENT Page 2 of 7

received an information from his private informant that two foreigners who brought Heroin by swallowing, were in the process of selling the same at Eurolanka Hotel, Situated at Marine drive, Bambalapitya. He in turn, informed to his superior, Inspector of Police (IP) Rangajeeva Neomal. A raid was organised and at around 12.10 noon, a team of seven officers from the PNB, proceeded to Bambalapitiya.

There, they met the informant and laid in ambush, after about few minutes IP

Neomal and PC Jaliya had seen, two Pakistani Nationals were coming out of the hotel, the informant confirmed those are the persons, whom he meant and fled away from that place. PNB officials then gradually approached the hotel. They have noticed one of them (First accused) were talking to someone on the phone, both persons were carrying a parcel bag each in their hands. When the officers were getting closer to the suspects, they have seen a person was travelling in a motor cycle from the direction of Fort towards Wellawatte, approached the 1 st Accused

and obtained the parcel from him and hanged the parcel on the motor cycle handle. When he attempted to leave the Police official who were there in ciwies moved into operation. IP Neomal approached the 1 st and 3rd Accused persons, PC

Jaliya stopped the appellant by holding the handle of the bike. The appellant further tried to getaway then the bike tilted to one side. PC Jaliya took the parcel from the handle and gave it to IP Neomal thereafter he apprehended the appellant. After the arrest of these three persons the PNB officials commenced further investigation.

Initially they found a key of room number 306 with the 1 st Accused they went to the room there they found a suitcase and it was locked. When inquired the pt

accused admitted it was his and he opened with his secret number, there they found another bag contained with heroin capsules. Further investigations revealed these 1 st and the 3rd accused persons were from Pakistan and they were staying in

two rooms. When they went to the next room bearing number 202, they have found a woman who is the wife of 3rd accused and two kids were there. When they searched the room, they didn't find anything suspicious, hence the woman and the kids were not taken into the police custody.

All three accused persons were taken to the PNB office and the formalities like field test, weighing, sealing and formal arrest were followed there. All were produced to the Judicial authorities after the investigations. The parcel recovered from the appellant weighed 500 grams. When the substance referred to the Government Analyst, it contained 246.14 grams of Diacetyl Morphine (Heroin).

After the trial, the accused appellant was found guilty and sentenced to death. Being aggrieved with the said conviction the appellant preferred this appeal and submitted the following grounds of appeal;

CA294-296/2015 JUDGMENT Page 3 of 7

1. The learned trial Judge erred in law referring defence in wrong demise. (sic)

2. Concept of joint possession not considered.

3. Prosecution filed to establish conscious possession.

At the trial against the appellant, the Prosecution called, IP Neomal, PC 6114 Jaliya,

PC 8450 Wakista Chief Inspector (CI) Rajakaruna and the Senior Assistant

Government analyst Ms. Ratnapala. When the defence called the Appellant opted to make a statement from the dock and called three witnesses Dilantha

Nanayakkara, Nadeera Jayasinghe and Premasiri Ratnayake from two

telecommunication companies.

Since the second and the third grounds of appeals Joint possession and Conscious

possession are deals with possession hence we decided to discuss those two at the

beginning.

Briefly, recalling the events as revealed by the witnesses for the prosecution, At the

hotel, PNB officials spotted the pt and the 3rd Accused persons, when they

approached the 2nd Accused appellant who came there in a Motor Cycle, received

the parcel from the 1st Accused. He was then arrested; the appellant takes up a

defence of alibi. He said that he was not arrested at Bambalapitiya but at

Boralasgamuwa. The defence witness says that there were two calls taken from the

mobile of the appellant, one at 1.27 noon and the other was at 3 pm. The appellant

denies the involvement and submits that if he was arrested as claimed by the

prosecution at about 1 pm and his phone was taken into the custody of the PNB, how could he take calls.

Presuming the prosecution facts are correct, we discuss about the joint possession.

Concept of Joint possession is discussed in many cases and it is well established in our legal system. In the present case, the prosecution clearly demarcates the

possession. The 1st Accused had the possession and he gave to the Appellant. There

is nothing to say that both were holding or possessing the parcel together.

The Appellant took up a defence that he was elsewhere at that time, so the issue of joint and conscious possession will not become a part of the defence. The

prosecution should prove the case beyond reasonable doubt, that burden never shifts until they complete the case for the prosecution.

It is the duty of the prosecution to prove the appellant had the heroin with him and he had conscious possession. In this case the prosecution witness says that the

appellant came in a motorcycle to the hotel, received the parcel bag from the 1st

CA294-296/2015 JUDGMENT Page 4 of 7

accused and hanged it in the bike and secured it. When he tried to move away, he

was apprehended.

Evidence of the prosecution witnesses says that the appellant took the parcel and kept it with him. It was in his custody. This is not an accidental pick up nor unknown possession. For all purpose there is no material to show that this is a theft or robbery. It was a clear transaction between the 1st accused and the appellant. The appellant from the beginning of the trial took up the stance that he doesn't know about this and he was arrested elsewhere and the case was falsely framed. He never took up a defence of innocent or unconscious possession.

As we discussed above the prosecution evidence regarding possession is consistent and corroborated by witnesses. We do not find any material to create a reasonable

doubt in the case for the prosecution, therefore we conclude that there is no merit in these two grounds of appeal.

The first ground of appeal is that the learned trial Judge erred in law by considering the evidence for the defence. We wish to consider this ground of appeal together with the entire case for the prosecution and the defence.

Recalling the facts again, the prosecution says that the 1st and the 3rd accused persons who were Pakistani nationals who had the heroin with them, had given it to the appellant. He took the parcel and secured it in his motorcycle and tried to go away, at that time the PNB officials had apprehended him.

The appellant says, that he was travelling from Kalubowila to Boralesgamuwa and he was arrested in front of the Police Station of Boralesgamuwa. He had no connection with the 1st and 3rd accused persons. He was never arrested at Euroasia hotel, Bambalapitiya. He further submits that he had used his mobile phone to call at 1.27 and 3 pm to take calls. It is his argument that if he was arrested at 1 pm and his belongings including the mobile phone was taken into Police custody how did he make those two calls.

We perused the evidence for the prosecution especially the chief investigating officer and PC Jaliya who apprehended the appellant, we could not find that the appellant had questioned or even suggested of these, taking calls from his mobile. It is only taken up by the appellant at the Dock Statement and thereafter. Appellant had called a witness from Etisalat Mobile company, he submitted that there were two calls originated from his Dialog mobile, first one was at 1.27 for 15 seconds and the other one was at 3 pm for 45 seconds.

CA294-296/2015 JUDGMENT Page 5 of7

The next witness M. Jayasinghe who is from the same company, says that he cannot provide more technical details like, what was the exact place the receiver phone

was at the time etc., He is not an expert nor a technical person.

Mr. Ratnayake who was attached to the Dialog mobile company was called as a defence witness says that the request of details came very much after three months hence they are unable to give any details regarding any calls taken or received before three months.

The prosecution submits that the appellant had conscious possession. The appellant not only denying the same but also submitting a defence of alibi.

The appellant submits an argument that, if he was arrested at 1 pm and his belongings including phone were taken into Police custody how could he take two calls at 1.27 and 3 pm. The Prosecution submits that this was not suggested to the chief investigating officer Neomal when he gave evidence. He was recalled to clarify the same, he told court that, he arrested the appellant at around 1 pm and took charge of the phone and examined the same. He submits that It is the practice of the PNB to collect the details and information from communication equipment for future intelligence information and operations. He further told Court that when

calls came it was allowed under their supervision similarly when took calls also allowed, these two calls above mentioned also allowed by him. He was extensively

cross examined on that fact, he cleared the suspicion and clarified the practice

adopted by the investigators of PNB.

It is evidence before the Court that the recipient of these calls was at Boralesgamuwa area, but there was nothing before the Court regarding the place of the appellant's mobile phone at that relevant time. Defence witness is not supporting the defence of alibi.

The chain of production was not contested and the evidence of the Government Analyst also not materially challenged.

Considering the entire proceedings, it is observed by the learned Trial Judge that the appellant and his were not sailing together. Both had taken different stances.

When we carefully considering the Judgment of the learned Trial Judge which consists of 110 pages, we find that he had considered all necessary ingredients in the judgment. The learned High Court Judge, after careful consideration found the appellant guilty after giving reasons.

CA294-296/2015 JUDGMENT Page 6 of 7

Considering all, we find that there is no merit in all the grounds of appeal, hence

we conclude, that we have no reas.on to interfere with the findings of the learned Trial Judge. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal and affirm the conviction.

Regarding the sentence even though the appellant did not make any submissions,

we considered the appropriateness and conclude that the gross weight was 500 grams and the net quantity was 246.14 grams of Diacetyl Morphine (Heroin). The other two accused persons were imposed of death sentence, after they pleaded guilty. Considering all we are of the view that the sentence imposed on the Appellant is reasonable in the given circumstances, accordingly, we affirm the sentence.

Appeal dismissed.
