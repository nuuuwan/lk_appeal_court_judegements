The Accused-Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

Appellant) was charged for causing the death of Kande Jayasinghege Piyadasa,

(hereinafter referred to as the deceased in the 1st count) and causing the death of

Maga1a Thottahachchige Kusumawathie, (hereinafter referred to as the deceased in

the 2nd count) offences punishable under Section 296 of the Penal Code. The

Appellant was also charged for voluntarily causing hurt to Kande Ranasinghe

J agath, thereby committing an offence under Section 314 of the Penal Code.

At the conclusion of the trial, the learned High Court Judge sentenced the

Appellant to death on count land 2 and was sentenced to 1 year's Rigorous

Imprisonment and to a fine of Rupees 2,000, having a default term of 1 year's

Simple Imprisonment on count 3.

Whilst admitting liability to the commiSSlOn of the said cnme, the

Appellant takes up the defence of grave and sudden provocation and seeks lesser

culpability against the conviction for murder on the strength of the defence

evidence. The Senior State Counsel appearing for the Respondent supports the

,

3

findings of the trial Court and seeks to uphold the conviction and sentence for

murder.

We enumerate the following items of evidence gIven on oath by the

Appellant;

(a) The father of the Appellant was a paralytic since the Appellant was 15

years of age and, therefore was compelled to shoulder the economic burden

of the family by helping his mother.

(b) Letters addressed to the Appellant was left at the deceased house since the

Appellant's dilapidated house was demolished and a new house being

constructed.

(c) The Appellant was awaiting a successful outcome of an interview which

would have secured him employment as a Police driver.

(d) The Appellant had gone to the deceased house to inquire as to whether

there were any letters addressed to him, at which point the deceased had

ridiculed the Appellant and had made insulting and derogatory remarks.

Certain remarks were in the nature of ridiculing and threatening his parents.

(e) The deceased in the 1 st count had approached the accused armed with an

iron crowbar in an abusive manner and had assaulted the accused.

(f) The accused had grabbed the crowbar and had inflicted serious lllJunes

which had resulted in his death.

5

evidence by the defence, at the least would suggest that the Appellant was

awaiting an out come to his application to enlist as a police driver attached to the

Special Task Force. When the Appellant inquired about the letter, the deceased in

the 1 st count had retorted in a sarcastic manner virtually indicating that the

Appellant was not suitable to this appointment and would be better off doing

something else. It is observed that the language used by the said deceased at that

moment was clearly derogatory. The language used by the deceased was not

confined to the Appellant alone, but also towards his father who was physically

invalid at the time and the mother who was shouldering the economic burden of

the family. The remarks made were not only detracting but also had the effect of

infusing fear of continued economic and social hardship on the Appellant.

The Appellant giving evidence stated that due to sudden anger which befell

him, he had taken the iron crowbar which was in the possession of the deceased in

the 1 st count to attack him. A few minutes later he had attacked the deceased in

the 2nd count. The Appellant also states that he was mentally disturbed and had no

control of himself at the time and further states that he had no alternative response

other than to assault the deceased.

The trial judge evaluating the evidence of the defence, has confined himself

to 2 or 3 sentences at the most, where he has rejected the defence of grave and

sudden provocation on the basis that the Appellant has lied in order to escape

culpability. The trial judge has considered that the Appellant has failed to take up

the said defence in the statement given to the police at the time of arrest, as a

material omission.

In the circumstances, the following issue can be identified arising out of the

said reasoning, that is,

has the trial judge failed to appreciate the defence of grave and sudden

provocation more so borne out by the defence case.

The trial judge considering the evidence of the Appellant concludes that, if

the Appellant is to be believed that he acted in self defence or out of provocation,

he should have stated that in his statement to the police. The judge further states

that taking a defence of provocation at the trial stage is a deliberate act on the part

of the Appellant to misdirect Court and conceal the truth from been revealed in

order to gain his freedom.

At this moment, it is to be noted agam that the police recorded the

statement of the Appellant less than an hour after arriving at the scene of the

crime. In his evidence, the Appellant clearly describes his mental condition as not

normal, as one could expect, in the given circumstances. Accordingly, the trial

judge has totally failed to evaluate the evidence put forward by the Appellant and

gives no reason for rejecting such evidence, which is compatible with the defence

of grave and sudden provocation. It is interesting to note that the omission which

the trial judge considers as an important omission arises out of the statement made

by the Appellant to the police officer, which by itself cannot form part of the

'. 'fY

7

evidence at a trial. However, based on this omission the judge completely rejects

the defence put forward by the Appellant.

It is incumbent upon a trial judge to evaluate the defence evidence in its

entirety and in its exact standpoint without shielding himself on extraneous

considerations which can shut out material facts led in evidence. To the expance

that the law provides, an accused should be free to exercise his legitimate right to

put forward his defence without any hindrance or restriction. The defence put

forward by the Appellant, which is vividly narrated in evidence on oath by the

Appellant and 7 witness testimonies consisting of 191 pages, is shut out

completely with the only finding that the omission as described above, is an

important consideration to reject the defence of grave and sudden provocation.

Consideration of extraneous material to shut out a defence taken up at a trial is

wholly unacceptable.

In the case of Uduma Lebbe Sailathumma alias Aish Umma and others

Vs. The Attorney General, CA 9512010 decided on 2510912014, the Court held

that,

"the evidence in Court is only the evidence led at the trial and

contradictions and omissions are not evidence, and used only to

diminish and or enhance the version of a particular witness or party

and to test the testimonial trustworthiness ",

As noted earlier, the Appellant has admitted liability and confines his

submission to seek a lesser culpability against the conviction for murder.

The offence of murder is reduced to culpable homicide not amounting to

murder, if the exception of grave and sudden provocation can be shown.

In the case of Kattadige Amarasena vs. The Democratic Socialist Republic

of Sri Lanka Sc. Appeal 3412001, the Court held that,

"The question is whether words uttered by the deceased (as in the dock

statement) provoked the accused gravely and suddenly and the accused

lost his self-control. Can a reasonable man in the same class likely to

lose his self control as a result of provocation?"

We observe from evidence that the accused was annoyed and/ or irritated

by the provocative and threatening utterances of the deceased in the 1 st count. The

said abusive utterances were directed at the accused, his parents, livelihood,

credibility, esteem and standing in society, all of which a reasonable man stands

for. The Appellant states that, he lost his sense of reasoning and had no alternative

other than to retaliate. After having attacked the deceased, the Appellant remained

at the scene of the crime until he was arrested. It is in evidence that the Appellant

temporarily lost his power of self-control, as a result he committed the unlawful

act.

Bertram c.J. said, in Punchirala (1924) 25 NLR 458;

"Provocation is, in my opinion, something which a reasonable man is

entitled to resent. "

9

In the circumstances, we are of the view that the evidence led in this case

clearly establish grave and sudden provocation which is an exception to Section

294 of the Penal Code.

Accordingly, we find that the evidence led in this trial clearly manifest

grave and sudden provocation which the trial judge has failed to consider in

arriving at the impugned judgment.

Accordingly, we set aside the conviction dated 3111 0/20 13, and the

corresponding sentence on count 1 and 2 and replace the conviction for murder to

one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the basis of grave and

sudden provocation and impose a sentence of 10 years rigorous imprisonment on

each count which is to be operative from the date of sentence namely, 31110/2013.

We also impose a fine of Rupees 10,000/- on each count with a default

sentence of 1 year's simple imprisonment. The sentence passed on count 3 will

remain. All sentences of imprisonment are ordered to run concurrently.

Appeal partly allowed.

S.Thurairaja PC, J

I agree.
