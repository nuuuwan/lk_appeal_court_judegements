Applicant-Respondent-Respondent

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: Murshid Maharoof for the Petitioner.

Respondent is absent and unrepresented.

Decided on: 04.12.2018

2

Samayawardhena, J.

This is an appeal filed by the respondent-petitioner-petitioner

(petitioner) with leave obtained against the order of the Board of

Quazis dated 20.12.2014.

Although notice was served on the applicant-respondent-

respondent (respondent) a number of occasions, both by way of

registered post and through Fiscal, the respondent did not come

to resist the appeal of the petitioner.

The Board of Quazis rejected the appeal of the petitioner without

going into the merits of the matter on two grounds. They are in

verbatim as follows:

(a) the petitioner has not averred that he has not previously

invoked the jurisdiction of the Board.

(b) the petitioner has not averred any exceptional

circumstances for delay in filing this revision application.

Regarding (a) above, it seems that the Board of Quazis has taken

the view that the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court Rules

shall mandatorily be followed in the proceedings before the

Board of Quazis. On that basis, following Nicholas v. Macan

Marker Ltd [1981] 2 Sri LR 1, the Board has decided that the

failure to set out in a separate averment in the petition that the

petitioner has not previously invoked the jurisdiction of the

Board of Quazis is fatal to the maintenance of the application.

The Board of Quazis does not state on what basis the Board

takes the view that the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court

Rules shall strictly be followed in the proceedings before the

3

Board of Quazis. The Court of Appeal has one set of Rules and

the Supreme Court has another set of Rules made by the Chief

Justice under the Constitution (presently under Article 136).

The above-mentioned case considered Rule 47 of the Supreme

Court Rules 1978. Similarly, the Board of Quazis has yet

another set of Rules.

The Rules which are applicable to an appeal from an order of

Quazi are set out in the Fifth Schedule of the Muslim Marriage

and Divorce Act, No.13 of 1951, as amended, under the heading

Rules for Appeal. There is no such Rule in the Fifth Schedule

to say that a petitioner or an appellant in an application filed

before the Board of Quazis shall in a separate averment state

that he has not previously invoked the jurisdiction of the Board

of Quazis.

But section 62 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act provides

for the Supreme Court to make separate Rules, if it deems

necessary, to be applicable in the proceedings before the Court

of Appeal filed against orders of the Board of Quazis. But there

is no such section in the said Act which enables the Supreme

Court to make Rules regarding the procedure to be adopted

before the Board of Quazis. Section 62 of the Act reads as

follows:

62(1) Any party aggrieved by any order of the Board of Quazis

on any appeal under section 60 may, with the leave of

the Court of Appeal first had and obtained, appeal to

that court from such order.

(2) The Supreme Court may, from time to time, make such

general rules as to it shall seem meet for regulating the

4

mode of applying for leave to appeal and of prosecuting

appeals from orders of the Board of Quazis and for

regulating any matters relating to the costs of such

applications for leave to appeal and of appeals.

In respect of the proceedings before the Board of Quazis, in

terms of section 94(1)(c) of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act,

it is the Minister in charge of the subject who has the authority

to make regulations inter alia for and in respect of the form and

method of appeals to the Board of Quazis and all matters

incidental or appertaining to the hearing such appeals and the

recording of verdict or decision of the board. The section 94(3)

further states that Every regulation made by the Minister under

this section shall be published in the Gazette. A regulation shall

not come into operation unless it has been approved by

Parliament nor until notification of such approval has been

published in the Gazette. It is not clear whether such

regulations have been made by the Minister. The Board of

Quazis has not referred to such regulations in the impugned

order.

As I stated at the outset, the respondent refused to come before

this Court to contest the petitioners appeal before this Court.

However, the respondent had been represented by a counsel

before the Board of Quazis. In the written submissions filed

before the Board of Quazis dated 14.12.2013, the counsel for the

respondent whilst first candidly admitting that there is no

format for Applications before the Board has nevertheless

justified the application of the Supreme Court Rules in Appeals

before the Board of Quazis in order to maintain the

respectability of the Board as the Board of Quazis is also an

5

Appellate Body. I need hardly emphasize that the Supreme

Court Rules and/or the Court of Appeal Rules cannot be applied

in the proceedings before the Board of Quazis on that basis.

I must at this juncture emphasize that Ruleswhether it be

Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal or the Board of

Quazishave been made not to obstruct justice but to facilitate

justice. Hence those Rules shall be interpreted and applied so

as to promote justice and not to thwart justice. Here there is no

complaint that the petitioner has previously invoked the

jurisdiction of the Board of Quazis on the same matter. It is

heartening to note that the trend of authority in the recent past

is to interpret the Rules quite liberally. The Superior Courts

have taken the view that the strict or absolute compliance of the

Rules is not necessary.

In Kiriwanthe v. Nawaratne [1990] 2 Sri LR 393 at 404 Mark

Fernando J. stated:

The weight of authority thus favours the view that while all

these Rules must be complied with, the law does not

require or permit an automatic dismissal of the application

or appeal of the party in default. The consequence of non-

compliance (by reason of impossibility or for any other

reason) is a matter falling within the discretion of the Court,

to be exercised after considering the nature of the default,

as well as the excuse or explanation therefor, in the context

of the object of the particular Rule.

In Senanayake v. Commissioner of National Housing [2005] 1 Sri

LR 182 at 184 Marsoof J. stated:

6

I am of the view that the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules, 1990 have been formulated to facilitate

the judicial process and with a view of achieving justice

rather than injustice. It appears from Rule 3(14) that it is

contemplated that where there is some non-compliance with

the Rules, the Registrar should put up the application for an

order of Court. The intention of this Rule is to give an

opportunity for the Court to exercise its discretion with

respect to the matter as is implicit from the use of the word

"may" in the last sentence of Rule 3(1)(a). Furthermore I am

of the view that in applications for prerogative relief where

this Court enjoys a supervisory jurisdiction, Court should

not non-suit a party where the non-compliance with Rules

takes place due to no fault of that party.

I am firmly of the view that cases shall, as far as possible, be

disposed of on merits and not on technical grounds. The latter,

in my view, is easy and speedy. But that is not what litigants

expect from Court. They want speedy but substantial

justicejustice which ensures a fair trial on merits. I fully

endorse the following valid observation made by Wigneswaran J.

in Senanayake v. Siriwardene [2001] 2 Sri LR 371 at 375:

Courts are fast making use of technical grounds and

traversing of procedural guidelines to dispose of cases

without reaching out to the core of the matters in issue and

ascertain the truth to bring justice to the litigants. This

tendency is most unfortunate. It could boomerang on the

judiciary as well as the existing judicial system.

There is no justification for the Board of Quazis to dismiss the

application of the petitioner in limine on the ground that there is

7

no specific averment in the petition to say that the petitioner

hereinbefore did not invoke the jurisdiction of the Board of

Quazis on the same matter.

In my view, the Supreme Court and Court of Appeal Rules are

inapplicable in proceedings before the Board of Quazis.

Let me now consider the second ground upon which the

application of the petitioner was dismissed without going into

the merits. That is on the basis that the petitioner has not

averred any exceptional circumstances for delay in filing this

revision application. I cannot understand what is meant by

averring exceptional circumstances for the delay. In my view,

showing exceptional circumstances to come by way of revision is

one thing, and the delay in coming to Court is another thing.

There is nothing called showing exceptional circumstances for

the delay. What you are expected to do is to explain the delay,

and not showing exceptional circumstances for the delay. It

appears that the Board has tried to apply those principals

without exactly knowing the true meaning of them.

Express provisions have been made in section 63 and the

proviso to Rule 1 in the Fifth Schedule of the Muslim Marriage

and Divorce Act, for the Board to entertain appeals filed out of

time.

According to the Quasi Court Records, the respondent has made

an application on 8th October 2009 stating that the petitioner

did not pay maintenance to the child from March 2007, which

was said to be in total a sum of Rs.260,000/=. Then according

to the typed notes under the date 10.10.2009, straightaway the

Quazi has issued the Enforcement Certificate to the Magistrates

8

Court. It is thereafter the petitioner has gone before the Board

of Quazis. Then the respondent before the Board of Quazis, in

paragraph 7 of her statement of objections, has stated that she

received maintenance until June 2008. This is contrary to her

earlier position where she told the Quazi that she received

maintenance until March 2007.

Be that as it may, it is the position of the petitioner that, the

maintenance paid was not to the child but to the wife, or at

least, both to the child and the wife, but after the registration of

the divorce in October 2007, the wife is not entitled to

maintenance. There is clearly a matter to be looked into.

There is a more serious matter the Board of Quazis should not

have overlooked. It has been transpired during the proceedings

before the Board of Quazis that proceedings before the Quazi on

09.09.2006 (according to the legible translation) have been

altered to the disadvantage of the petitioner. In the first place, I

must mention that the Quazis handwriting cannot be read at

all. He has not taken any interest to write legibly. He has made

journal entries illegibly and irresponsibly. The serious matter is

not that one. In the photocopy of the proceedings issued to the

petitioner what the Quazi has originally appears to have written

is Maintenance to be paid at Rs.10,000/= with effect from

today. After issuance of that copy, but before sending the

record to the Board of Quazis the words to child has been

introduced after Rs.10,000/= to read as Maintenance to be

paid at Rs.10,000/= to child with effect from today. This is

crucial to the petitioners application. This is a serious matter

on the part of the Quazi, if he has done it. Up to now, he has

not denied it. I fail to understand why and how the Board of

9

Quazis just ignored it without taking a serious note of it. I direct

the Chairman of the Board of Quazis to make an initial inquiry

into that matter and then refer the matter with his observations

and with the relevant documents including the contradictory

proceedings to the Secretary of the Judicial Service Commission

for suitable action.

There is no magic in the phrase exceptional circumstances.

Nor is there fixed meaning to it. It depends on facts and

circumstances of each individual case. The petitioner after

narrating his case in the petition filed before the Board of Quazis

in paragraph 21 has stated that there are exceptional

circumstances for the Board to exercise its revisionary

jurisdiction.

The Board has taken the view that the petitioner has come

before the Board on 06.06.2010 challenging the order of the

Quazi dated 09.09.2006 and there is an unexplainable delay.

Firstly, the petitioner went before the Board of Quazis not on

06.06.2010 but on 06.08.2010. Secondly, nowhere does the

petitioner state in the petition that he challenges the order dated

09.09.2006. His complaint as I understand is that during the

course of his Talak Divorce Application, without a formal

application, an order was made to pay maintenance in a sum of

Rs.10,000/= both to the respondent wife and the child, but after

he obtained Talak divorce, he is not bound to pay maintenance

to his former wife.

It appears that the Quazi did not write in the proceedings

whether that sum is only for the child or only for the wife or for

both, but later added the words for child after the sum.

10

As I said earlier the respondent having waited several years after

the divorce, filed an application before the Quazi complaining

that the petitioner does not pay maintenance to the child in a

sum of Rs.10,000/= per mensem. In my view, when that

application was made by the respondent, what the Quazi should

have done was not to forthwith issue Enforcement Order to the

Magistrate Court, but to issue Notice to the petitioner and then

make a suitable order.

The above views shall not be regarded as concluded views of this

Court, but made to emphasize the fact that there are exceptional

circumstances for the Board to look into in this matter on merits

and there is no delay in coming before the Board of Quazis.

In Lulu Balakumar v. Balasingham Balakumar [1997] BALR 22

Justice Mark Fernando remarked that: "mere delay does not

automatically amount to laches, and that the circumstances of the

particular case, the reason for the delay, and impact of the delay

on the other party, must all be taken into account." His Lordship

further commented that: "In any event, the question of laches

cannot be determined only by considering how many trial dates,

or how long a period of time, has lapsed. The circumstances are

relevant."

I set aside the order of the Board of Quazis dated 20.12.2014

and direct the Board of Quazis to hear the appeal of the

petitioner on merits and make a suitable order in accordance

with law.

Appeal allowed.
