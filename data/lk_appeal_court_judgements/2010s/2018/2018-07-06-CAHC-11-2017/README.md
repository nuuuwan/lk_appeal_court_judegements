The Accused Appellant is present in court produced by the Prison Authorities.

Heard both counsel in support of the Appeal and against the appeal.

The accused-appellant was indicted in the High Court of Kegalle for committing

the murder of Wickrama Pedige Nilantha Darmasiri on or above 08.01.2009,

pur.ishabie under Section 296 of the Penal Code. After trial, he was found guilty

and sent~nced to death. Tt~s appr-:al is from the said conviction and sentence.

According ~o the evidence of the prosecution witnesses namely, the wife and the

daughter of the deceased, the deceased was at home on the day of the incident

when the appellant came and called him out and attacked him with a knife. The

defence of the Appellant was that both of them were drinking together and the

deceased took out a knife to attack the Appellant and while he tried to grab the

knife from him this happened. But it has not been put to the prosecution

witnesses that the knife was broughf-by, the deceased. Therefore, he cannot

bring this argument now.

Learned Counsel for the Appellant citing the judgment of Jayathilaka Vs. A.G. 1

SLR 2003 page No. 107 argued that the learned High Court Judge has not

considered the state of intoxication of the deceased and the Appellant. There is

no evidence to say that the deceased was under the influence of liquor. The

Post Mortem Report indicates that "alcohol smell is not clear." The Appellant in

his evidence did not say that he was intoxicated at the time of the incident.

The Appellant in his allocutus has admitted that he tried to defend himself. No

such suggestion has been made to the witnesses during the trial.

3 .

I Learned Senior State Counsel then referred to evidence of the witnesses

Katherine and Sunil where both of them stated that they had dinner late in night

before they went to sleep. The learned High Court Judge has considered the

evidence and the medical evidence when delivering his findings. Therefore, we

are not inclined to set aside a weI! considered judgment of the learned High

Court Judge. The judgment dated 02.02.2017 is affirmed.

Appeal dismissed.
