Samayawardhena, J.

When this matter came up for argument for the first time before

me on 06.06.2018, counsel for the parties invited me to deliver the

Judgment on the written submissions already filed of record.

This is a partition action. Judgment has been pronounced on

09.07.1997. According to the Judgment, inter alia, the rights of

Juwanis Fernando devolved according to the pedigree of the 3rd,

6th, 24th and 28th defendants.

In the penultimate paragraph of the Judgment, the District Judge

has directed the plaintiff to tender the List of Shares prepared in

terms of the Judgment, and has further noted that the said List of

Shares shall be treated as a part of the Judgment.

After the pronouncement of the Judgment, the 24th and 28th

defendants have made an application to the District Judge that the

finding in the Judgment that rights of Juwanis Fernando shall

devolve according to the pedigree of the 3rd, 6th, 24th and 28th

defendants is erroneous to the extent that the 3rd defendant is not

an heir of Juwanis Fernando. The District Judge has accepted that

position in the subsequent order dated 21.09.1999. That order is

unchallenged.

Thereafter, several parties including the 24th and 28th defendants

have tendered different Lists of Shares purportedly made in

accordance with the Judgment, and as there had been no

consensus as to allocation of shares, the succeeding District Judge

has made the order dated 18.06.2002. It is against this order the

24th and 28th defendants have filed this revision application

whatever they have prayed for in the prayer to the petition.

3

In the written submissions of the said defendants dated

14.07.2014, they canvass the said order on two grounds.

One is regarding the fresh order made by the succeeding Judge in

relation to the devolution of rights of Juwanis Fernando. The

succeeding Judge in the said order states that according to

paragraph 7 of the statement of claim of the 6th, 24th and 28th

defendants dated 11.12.1985, the rights of Juwanis Fernando

shall devolve on 6th, 24th, 28th defendants and Podilina, and

Podilina is entitled to 38/192 shares and that shall be left

unallotted. I cannot understand why the succeeding Judge wanted

to decide upon the rights of Juwanis Fernando when there was no

dispute over that matter. However it is clear from paragraph 11 of

the said statement of claim that upon the death of Podilina her

rights have devolved on her widower and children and they in turn

have transferred their rights to the 24th defendant and the 24th

defendant has transferred them to the 6th defendant. Hence it is

clear that the succeeding Judge has erred when she stated that

Podilina is entitled to 38/192 shares and that should be kept

unallotted. Podilina has left no rights.

The other point raised by the 24th and 28th defendants in the

written submissions is that notwithstanding the District Judge in

the Judgment has stated that Thegis Appu was entitled to

share, the succeeding Judge in the impugned order has

erroneously stated that Thegis Appu was entitled to share. This

submission is unacceptable. According to the Judgment, one of

the four original owners, namely Koranelis Appu, has transferred

his share to Thegis Appu by Deed marked P2 and therefore the

finding that Thegis Appu has become entitled to share of the

corpus is correct.

4

The application of the 24th and 28th defendants is partly allowed.

No costs.
