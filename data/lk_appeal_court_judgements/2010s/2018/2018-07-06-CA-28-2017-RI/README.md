Samayawardhena, J.

The plaintiff-respondent (respondent) filed action against the

defendant-petitioner (petitioner) in the District Court of Negombo

seeking declaration of title to and ejectment from the land in suit.

Summons was served on the petitioner by pointed out service, but

the petitioner returned the summons to Court stating that the

name and address is not accuratevide the letter at page 132 of

the District Court Brief marked P1. The District Court fixed the

case for ex parte trial and delivered Judgment for the respondent.

Ex parte decree was served on the petitioner in the same name and

address and the petitioner made an application (under section

86(2) of the Civil Procedure Code) to purge default within time.

However on the date fixed for support of that application, the

petitioner was neither present nor represented and the Court

according to the petitioner affirmed the ex parte order vide

paragraph 7 of the written submissions of the petitioner. After the

lapse of several months, on the application of the respondent writ

was issued and thereafter the petitioner made another application

to stay execution of the writ. This was disallowed by the District

Judge by order dated 23.01.2009 and the writ was executed and

he was dispossessed.

The petitioner appealed against that order to the Civil Appeal High

Court of Gampaha and that Court dismissed the said appeal by

Judgment dated 06.10.2016.

The petitioner did not appeal to the Supreme Court against that

Judgment. Instead he filed this application on 22.11.2017 for

restitutio in integrum seeking (a) a declaration that all proceedings

in the District Court from the date the case was fixed for ex parte

trial are null and void and (b) to set aside the Judgement of the

Civil Appeal High Court.

I must straightaway state that this Court has no jurisdiction to set

aside the Judgment of the Civil Appeal High Court and only the

Supreme Court has jurisdiction to do sovide the express

provision contained in section 5C of the High Court of the

Provinces (Special Provisions) Act, No. 19 of 1990 introduced by

section 2 of the High Court of the Provinces (Special Provinces)

(Amendment) Act, No. 54 of 2006.

Let me now consider why the petitioner says that all proceedings in

the District Court from the date the case was fixed for ex parte trial

are null and void. That is on the ground that summons was not

properly served on him. Why he says summons was not properly

served on him? That is because name and address is not accurate

in that in the summons his name and address is stated as "P.K.

Stanly Micheal Silva, No.189/2, Samanala Mawatha, K.C. de Silva

Puraya, Thibirigaskatuwa" but his correct name and address is

"G.A. Stanly Micheal Silva, No.185, Samanala Mawatha, K.C. de

Silva Puraya, Thibirigaskatuwa".

The petitioner in paragraph 20 of his written submissions says

that as he (the petitioner) and the respondent were living in one

land, the respondent would have known his correct name and

address.

Then it is abundantly clear that the respondent has pointed out

the correct defendant to the fiscal irrespective of the fact that there

is a slight difference regarding initials and assessment number of

the house.

This slight difference regarding name and address is completely

beside the point and can be corrected as long as the correct person

to whom summons shall be served has been correctly identified

and summons served. The reason is that "Names are used only to

designate persons, and the suit is not against names but against

persons designated thereby". (Parsons v. Abdul Cader1, W.M.

Mendis & Co v. Excise Commissioner2, Mohinudeen v. Lanka

Bankuwa, York Street, Colombo 13) In Parsons case (supra) it was

held that Where judgment is entered in a case against a person

under a wrong name, the Court has inherent power to substitute the

right name in the caption of a plaint even after the decree.

The remedy by way of restitutio in integrum is an extraordinary

remedy and is given only under very exceptional circumstances.

(Halib Abdul Cader Ameer v. Danny Perera4, Sri Lanka Insurance

Corporation Ltd v. Shanmugam5) No such circumstances are to be

found in the present case. I refuse to issue notice on the

respondent.

Application is dismissed.
