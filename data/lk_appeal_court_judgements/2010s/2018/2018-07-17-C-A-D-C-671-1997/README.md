T

his is a partition action in which the learned District Judge of Kandy allotted 1O/60th

share of the subject~matter to the Plaintiff~Appellant (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as "the Plaintiff") at the conclusion of the trial, though he had claimed 29/46th

share in his plaint. The reduction of the share of the Plaintiff is traceable to the finding

that the learned District Judge has reached at the conclusion of the trial that the 3rd and

4th Defendant~Respondents who had not been assigned any shares in the plaint should

also be allotted 5/60th and 30/60th shares.

The principal complaint of the Plaintiff at the hearing of this appeal was that the learned

District Judge of Kandy erroneously applied the Roman Dutch law (RDL) principle of

exceptio rei venditae et traditae to parties who were admittedly Kandyans. The thrust of the

argument of the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff~ Appellant was that exceptiO rei venditae et

traditae does not apply to parties who are admitted to be governed by Kandyan law. No

doubt an admission was recorded at the trial that the parties were subject to Kandyan

law. Hence the argument that the RDL principle has no place in Kandyan law.

I must state at the very outset that the learned District Judge of the Kandy applied the

Roman Dutch law principle of exceptio rei venditae et traditae in the allotment of shares to

the 4 th Defendant~ Respondent which has led to the reduction of the shares of the

Plaintiff. In order to understand the applicability and application of the Roman Dutch

2

law principle which the learned District Judge has found for the 4th Defendant~

Respondent, a look at the transactions that are material becomes apposite.

Initially Gamagedera Kirihamy and Athugal Pedi Gedera Silindu (the grandmother of the

Plaintiff) were admitted to be the joint owners of the property. It so happened that

Gamagedera Kirihamy and Athugal Pedi Gedera Silindu made a gift of an undivided

14/15th share of the subject~matter to Manikrala, Ranbanda (the 2nd Defendant) and

Mudiyanse by a Deed of Gift bearing No.15201 and dated 22.05.1950. Having thus

divested her title, Silindu however transferred a non~existent half share to the 4th

Defendant~Respondent by way of Deed of Transfer bearing No.14083 and dated

29.06.1961. Obviously there was no title in her to effect this transfer but she did effect

this transfer in 1961.

Six years later after the aforesaid transfer, Silindu reacquired her title by revoking the

previous gift made in 1950. In other words she effected the revocation on 15.11.1967 by a

Deed of Revocation bearing No.14890. It is this reacquisition of title which the learned

District Judge found vested title in the 4th Defendant~Respondent. This occurred

through the application of the RDL principle exceptio rei venditae et traditae. For the reasons

set out below I take the view that the learned District Judge of Kandy was quite right in

applying this principle in respect of Silindu's transfer to 4th Defendant~Respondent.

Subsequent Acquisition of Title

Silindu the grandmother of the Plaintiff revoked the gift subsequently by the Deed of

Revocation bearing No.15201 and dated 22.05.1950.

The general principle is that the vendor must have ownership of the thing he wishes to

sell. But the Roman~ Dutch Law recognizes the vendor's position in a suit where he had

acquired title subsequently. This principle is known as de exceptione rei venditae et traditae

(the plea of "sold and delivered'? in Roman~Dutch Law~See Voet in book XXI (21), title 3. The

Roman Dutch Law as laid down by Voet appears as above (Voet 21.3) in T. Berwick's

translation of Johannes Voet in a treatise entitled A CONTRIBUTION TO AN ENGLISH

3

TRANSLATION OF VOETs COMMENTARY ON THE PANDECTS and the following

extracts are from Berwick's Translation at pp 542 et seq.:~

"Section l~Since on the confirmation of the right of an alienator (which was

defective at the time of the alienation) the originally defective right of the alienee

becomes confirmed from the very moment that the vendor acquired the dominium;

and therefore the dominium, from that time annexed to the original purchaser, could

not be taken away from him without his own act or consent; hence he has the

right of suing his vendor or a third party~possessor on account of the loss of his

possession, and of defeating his opponent's plea by the replication of ownership."

"Section 2~But if the purchaser still possesses the thing, and the same persons that

are liable to be sued (by him) in respect of its eviction bring an action to evict the

property from him, it is in his discretion, whether he will suffer eviction and

afterwards, when it has been taken from him. sue the successful party by the

action ex stipulatio in duplum, or by the action exempto for the id qodintrest (damages),

or whether he will prefer to keep the property and repel his vendor and other like

persons seeking to evict him either by the exceptiO rei venditae et traditae or by the

exceptiO doli."

"Section 3~ This plea may be opposed, not only to the original vendor, but to all

those who claiming under him endeavour to evict a thing from the first purchaser;

such as those to whom the vendor has again alienated the same thing, whether by

an onerous or lucrative tide after he became owner (i.e., after he acquired the

dominium which he did not have when he first sold it)'''

It was these RDL principles that the learned Counsel for the Plaintiff~Appeliant argued

did not apply to those admittedly governed by Kandyan law.

On a perusal of the cases decided by the Supreme Court on the question of the

applicability of this principle, undoubtedly it would be seen that there was a fluctuation

4

of views of the judges in favour of and against it. There were conflicting decisions and in

Rajapaksa v. Fernando (1918) 20 N.LR. 30l, the Supreme Court (Ennis,]. and Shaw,].)

held that Ordinance No. 7 of 1840 did not apply to estates vesting by operation of law

and that consequently there was nothing in that Ordinance to limit the application of

the principle of the Roman-Dutch Law. It has to be remembered that Ordinance No.7 of

1840 was the first ever Prevention of Frauds Ordinance in the country which was

followed by Ordinances No. 16 of 1852, 11 of 1896 and 60 of 1947. In fact Ordinance No.7

of 1840 provided that "No sale, purchase, transfer, assignment, or mortgage of land ...... and

no promise, bargain, contract, or agreement for effecting such object should be of force or

avail in law unless in writing."

Both learned Judges (Ennis,]. and Shaw,].) authoring two separate judgments stated

therein that this is clearly an enumeration of personal transactions, and does not include

in its scope transmission of property by operation of law ... see Ennis,]. at page 304 and

Shaw,]. at page 307. Ennis,]. explained it lucidly at page 304:-

"It seems to me that the English law doctrine, that where A without title sells to B,

and A subsequently acquires title, the title enures to the benefit of B; and the

Roman-Dutch law doctrine in similar circumstances of "confirmation" (Voet 21,3,1)

is such a transmission".

The upshot of the reasoning is that that the subsequent title enures to the benefit of B,

without a further deed from the vendor.

The decision was appealed against to the Privy Council and the decision is reported as

Rajapakse v. Fernando (1920) 21 N.LR 495. Lord Moulton delivering the opinion of the

Privy Council (with Viscount Haldane and Lord Parmoor concurring) agreed with the

judgment of the Supreme Court (supra) and quite pertinently observed at p.497:-

" ......... their Lordships are of opinion that by the Roman-Dutch law as existing in

Ceylon the English doctrine applies that where a grantor has purported to grant

an interest in land which he did not at the time possess, but subsequently

5

acquires, the benefit of his subsequent acquisition goes automatically to the

benefit of the earlier grantee, or, as it is usually expressed, "feeds the estoppel."

One could see from this decision one of several modes though which English law was

introduced into this country. Judges ventured to apply English law on the premise that

the relevant Roman-Dutch principle was no different from the English law principle.

Sometimes purporting to apply Roman-Dutch law, judges in fact applied English law.

The decisions of the Supreme Court and Privy Council in Rajapakse v. Fernando (supra)

are instances of introduction of English law otherwise than through legislation. That is

how our legal system became a proud heir to the gladsome jurisprudence of both English

law and Roman-Dutch law and it is richer for this mixed confluence.

The above principle was again extensively discussed by a Full Bench in the case of

Gunatilleke v. Fernando (1919)21 N.LR. 257, where Bertram CJ. went into the history

of the earlier conflicting judgments, and the Full Court held that this principle of the

Roman-Dutch Law-

(a) Is not abrogated by Ordinance No.7 of 1840.

(b) Is not available only as a defence, but can also be made the foundation of the

action.

(c) Is not, in the latter case, limited to actions brought for the recovery of a lost

possession.

Harking back to the eqUitable principle of feeding the estoppel-the equitable principle

which says that if a person promises more than what he can perform, he must fulfil the

promise when he secures the ability to do so, Bertram CJ., also held that the Roman-

Dutch law is in accord with the English law on the subject that a person who sells

property is estopped from disputing the title of his vendee, and that when he

subsequently acquires a title, that title passes to his vendee.

"As it is put in the leading case of Doe v. Oliver (2 Smith's Leading Cases, 11th Edition,

724), "the interest when it accrues feeds the estoppel ....... "

6

Ennis, J. and De Sampayo, J. (the other members of the Full Bench) wrote two different

judgments affirming the principle. It has to be remembered that the gladsome principle

proceeds on the basis that a vendee can plead exceptio rei venditae et traditae not only against

the vendor but also against his successor in title.

Is not this principle applicable in Kandyan Law?

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff, Appellant contended that the Roman' Dutch

principle of exceptiO rei venditae et traditae has no place in Kandyan law. I was not referred

to, nor have I been able to find any case in which the principle was disapplied in regard

to Kandyans who having sold property without title subsequently reacquired title. This

argument brought to the fore the status of Roman' Dutch law as the common law or

residuary law in this country.

In Ceylon the continuance of the Roman,Dutch Law was guaranteed by the

Proclamation of Governor Francis North of September 23,1799, which declared that the

administration of justice and police should be henceforth and during His Majesty's

pleasure exercised by all Courts of judicature, civil and criminal, 'according to the laws

and institutions that subsisted under the ancient government of the United Provinces',

subject to such deviations and alterations as have been or shall be by lawful authority

ordained and published.

The Charter of Justice of 1833 and the Ordinance NO.5 of 1835 which repealed the

Proclamation of 1799 expressly retained that part of it which provided that justice should

be administered according to the laws and institutions that were established under the

ancient Government of the United Provinces subject to deviations by lawful authority.

This Ordinance also significantly goes on to declare, in terms of even more categorical

than those of the Proclamation of 1799, that those laws and institutions "still are and

shall henceforth continue to be binding and administered throughout the Maritime

Provinces and their dependencies" subject to the aforesaid deviations and alterations.

Thus, the Roman,Dutch Law was firmly enthroned as the common law of this country

subject to such deviations as might be legislatively ordained.

7

The central part of the island did not pass under British rule until 1815, but the Dutch

Law as applied to this region was extended to Kandyan Provinces by Ordinance No.5 of

1852. This Ordinance extends to the Kandyan Provinces certain specified branches of the

law of the Maritime Provinces, and further enacts that if the Kandyan Law is silent on

any matter the law of the Maritime Provinces is to be applied. Section 5 of Ordinance

NO.5 of 1852 provided that in all cases where there was no Kandyan law or custom

applicable to any question arising within the Kandyan Provinces the Court should have

recourse to the law of the Maritime Provinces. In fact in Samarasinghe v. Samarasinghe

(1989) 2 Sri L.R. 180 the Court of Appeal described the Roman-Dutch law as 'the

common law of the country applicable to the low country Sinhalese and others not

governed by their own speciallaws.'-see p.l83.

Thus the Roman-Dutch law on fidei commissa and gifts have been applied to dispositions

of property by persons governed by Kandyan law or Muslim law. Alluding to the

judgment of De Sampayo, J. in Assistant Government Agent, Kandy v. Kalu Banda

(1921) 23 N.L.R 26, O.S.M. Seneviratne. j, in the case of Ratnayake v. Bandara (1986) 1

Sri L.R. 245 at p 248 stated thus:-

"This case sets out clearly the position when a person subject to the Kandyan Law

executes a deed of gift, subject to certain conditions and restrictions which deed is

a valid deed in Kandyan law, such an instance will be identified by the term or

concept known to Roman-Dutch Law as fidei commissum "as a convenient

expression" because there is no legal concept known to Kandyan Law as fidei

commissum. "

In the case of Menika v. Banda 5 N.L.R. 207 jayawardene AJ held as follows:-

"The deed of gift, although it creates a fidei commissum, is valid under the Kandyan

Law. Although we may resort to the Roman-Dutch law to ascertain whether the

deed creates a valid fidei commissum or not..."

All these precedents show that Roman-Dutch law continues to be the common law or

residuary law in this country when personal laws are silent and this eloquence of the

8

..

Roman~Dutch law is evidenced in the case of exceptio rei venditae et traditae as the doctrine

can be grafted on to persons governed by Kandyan Law.

In the circumstances the learned District Judge of Kandy arrived at the correct finding

and I see no reason to interfere with the judgment dated 27.06.1997. The judgment is

affirmed and I proceed to dismiss the appeal.
