Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Party Noticed - Petitioner (the Petitioner) has filed this revision application

seeking inter alia the following relief:

(a) To set aside the Order dated 25th July 2017 made by the learned High Court

Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province, holden at

Gampaha in High Court Case No. HCRA 15/2016;

(b) To set aside the Order dated 28th November 2017 made by the learned High

Court Judge of the Provincial High Court of the Western Province, holden at

Gampaha in High Court Case No. HCRA 15/2016;

(c) To set aside the Order dated 9th November 2017 made by the learned

Magistrate of Attanagalle in Case No. AR 16/2016;

(d) To set aside the Order dated 30th November 2017 made by the learned

Magistrate of Attanagalle in Case No. AR 16/2016.

The First Party Applicant - Respondent - Respondent (the First Party) was, at the

relevant time, the registered owner of vehicle bearing Registration No. NWPP

6629. On 19th December 2015, she lodged a complaint at the Giriulla Police

Station against the Second Party Applicant - Petitioner - Respondent (the Second

Party).l The complaint was that the Second Party was illegally retaining the said

1 A copy of the said complaint has been annexed to the petition marked 'P2'

vehicle which she claimed she had entrusted to the Second Party prior to being

hospitalized.

The First Party had subsequently filed a similar complaint with the Mirigama

Police. The Officer-in-Charge of the Mirigama Police (the Police) had produced the

said vehicle before the Magistrate's Court of Attanagalla and reported facts to the

learned Magistrate by way of an fA' Report dated osth January 2016. The First

Party and the Second Party were cited as applicants or claimants of the said

vehicle.

In the said Report, the Police had stated that the vehicle is being produced to the

Magistrate's Court as there was a suspicion that the said vehicle may be used to

commit an offence.2 The Police had thus sought an order from the Magistrate's

Court in terms of Section 431(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979, as amended (the Code).

The learned Magistrate, purporting to hold an inquiry under Section 431(1) of the

Code had directed the First Party and the Second Party to file written submissions

in order to determine the person to whom the vehicle should be handed over.

The Order of the learned Magistrate was delivered on 25th of February 2016. By

the said Order, the learned Magistrate held as follows:

2 The relevant paragraph in the Report filed by the Police reads as follows: @ei>a> e>tm ~ er~ ~ ) ~ 6oofOO) Iffi~~ ~ e>~ OOco ~ 8 ~o~ ~>SIm Iffic.oes> ID~ 8 er~ ffiIDes5Q~m ~)c5 ~~ &

<ies>>t6> me> <i~es> IDte>~ ... "

The learned Magistrate, having held that a criminal offence has not been made

out, held further that the First Party as the registered owner of the said vehicle is

the person who is entitled to the possession of the said vehicle. The learned

Magistrate thereafter proceeded to release the said vehicle to the First Party.3

Very importantly, the learned Magistrate did not impose any conditions relating

to the release of the vehicle. Thus, there was no impediment to the First Party

transferring the ownership of the vehicle.

Being dissatisfied with the said Order of the learned Magistrate, the Second Party

filed Revision application No. HCRA 15/2016 in the Provincial High Court of the

Western Province holden at Gampaha on 28th March 2016. The First Party, the

Police and the Attorney General were cited as Respondents. The grievance of the

Second Party was that the learned Magistrate had not held an inquiry and thereby

deprived the Second Party from tendering any documents to substantiate his

position. The Second Party also alleged that possession of the vehicle should be

given to the person in whose possession the vehicle was, at the time the vehicle

was seized by the Police.

3 The First Party was the registered owner of the said vehicle at the time the Magistrate made the Order

7

..

8

The relief sought from the High Court was to set aside the Order of the learned

Magistrate. Very importantly, the Second Party had sought an interim order to

prevent the First Party from selling the said vehicle4, in addition to staying the

order of the learned Magistrate. It was imperative for the Second Party to support

the application at the first available opportunity and obtain a stay order

preventing the First Party from transferring the vehicle, to prevent the Revision

application from becoming futile. It is rather regretful to note that the Second

Party has not acted diligently in obtaining the stay order prayed for at the first

available opportunity. As a result, he finds himself in this predicament today.

Even though the revision application was filed on 28th March 2016 and the

learned High Court Judge directed that notices be served on 31st March 2016, the

notices to be served on the Respondents had been tendered by the Second Party

only on 18th April 2016, thereby contributing to the delay.

The application for interim relief was finally supported on 29th June 2016. The

learned High Court Judge granted ex parte a Stay Order until the final

determination of the Revision Application preventing the First Party from

transferring the vehicle to a third party. It is clear from the Order of the learned

High Court Judge that the stay order has been issued on the submission of the

4 Paragraph 21 of the petition reads as follows: ~Ot ~~ II.1lO OO~, e e5)~~ er~O)e5) &8coksx.o ~e5) e~ C(5)05 ~)~) ~dJ &8c.oks:>co er~ee er~~ eDO~ ee)~>05, er~ Ot 2,150,000/-C@)e 1 eten e~ eSes5 2 ~z;en e)~C) ecs>ec.o go,} )Q ~@ ~C5 er~ ~

Counsel for the Second Party that there is information that the said vehicle may

be transferred by the First Party and that if the said vehicle is transferred, the

Second Party would not receive the relief claimed in the revision application.

The First Party, having appeared before the High Court on notice, informed Court

on 3rd August 2016 that it would be futile to proceed with the revision application

as she had transferred the said vehicle to Egoda Arachchige Dinesh Sanjeeva on

11th April 2016. In turn Dinesh had transferred the vehicle to Peramabaduge

Wickramasuriya Sanjaya on 16th May 2016.

Although the fact that the vehicle had been transferred was brought to the notice

of the Second Party, no steps were taken on his behalf to add the new owner as a

respondent and obtain a stay order preventing a further transfer of the said

vehicle. It appears that the Second Party proceeded on the basis that the

Magistrate's Court has the power to call for the vehicle, inspite of the vehicle

having been sold. This Court observes that if this was the case, the Second Party

need not have prayed for interim relief in his revision application.

The Revision Application before the learned High Court Judge was taken up for

argument on 13th February 2017. Having heard the First Party and the Second

Party, the learned High Court Judged delivered his judgment on 25th July 2017. By

this judgment, the learned High Court Judge set aside the Order of the learned

Magistrate dated 25th February 2016 and directed that possession of the said

vehicle should be handed over to the Second Party forthwith. The learned High

Court Judge had proceeded on the basis that the Magistrate could not have acted

9

10

under the provisions of Section 431(1) of the Code as the situations envisaged

therein had not arisen and in view of the finding of the learned Magistrate that

the dispute between the parties was entirely civil.

In compliance with the judgment of the High Court, the Magistrate had issued

notice on the Petitioner, who by then was the owner of the said vehicle, having

purchased the vehicle on 1st November 2016, directing that the vehicle be

produced before the Magistrate. According to the Petitioner, he became aware of

the case and the background circumstances relating to this case only when he

received this notice. The Petitioner had appeared before the learned Magistrate

and explained the circumstances under which he had purchased the said vehicle.

However, the learned Magistrate, by an order made on 9th November 2017 had

pointed out that his hands are tied and that he has to comply with the judgment

of the learned High Court Judge.

The Petitioner thereafter filed a petition in the High Court of Gampaha, seeking to

be added as a party in Revision Application No. 15/2016. The substantive relief

sought by the Petitioner was to set aside the order of the learned Magistrate

dated 9th November 2017 as well as set aside the judgment of the High Court

dated 25th July 2017.

The Intervenient Party - Respondent, the Hatton National Bank too had filed an

application to intervene in the High Court case and to set aside the judgment of

the High Court, as the said vehicle had been purchased by the Petitioner, having

obtained a lease facility from the Bank.

10

11

Having considered the applications of the Petitioner and the Bank, the learned

High Court Judge, by an Order dated 28th November 2017 refused to grant the

relief prayed for by the Petitioner and the Bank. When the case was called before

the Magistrate's Court on 30th November 2017, the learned Magistrate had once

again pointed out that he is compelled to act in terms of the judgment of the High

CourtS and directed the Police to seize the said vehicle and produce it before

Court.

Being dissatisfied with the Orders made by the learned High Court Judge on 28th

November 2017 and the orders made by the learned Magistrate6, the Petitioner

invoked the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court, seeking to set aside the said

orders and the judgment of the High Court. This Court, on 21st February 2018,

having heard the learned Counsel for the Petitioner and the Second Party, issued

a stay order as prayed for in paragraphs 'B{iv) - (vi)' of the prayer to the petition.7

The Second Party thereafter filed its Statement of Objections. When this matter

was taken up on 24th May 2018, both parties agreed that this Court can deliver its

judgment on the Written Submissions filed by the Parties.

Paragraph B{vi) -Stay further proceedings in the Magistrate's Court until the final determination of this application.

11

12

The starting point of this application is the Report filed by the Police, seeking an

Order under Section 431{1} of the Code. Hence, it would be appropriate at this

stage to consider the provisions of Section 431{1} of the Code, which reads as

follows:

liThe seizure by any police officer of property taken under section 29 or alleged

or suspected to have been stolen or found under circumstances which create

suspicion of the commission of any offence shall be immediately reported to a

Magistrate who shall forthwith make such order as he thinks fit respecting the

delivery of such property to the person entitled to the possession thereof, or if

such person cannot be ascertained respecting the custody and production of

such property."

In terms of Section 431{1} of the Code, an order can be made inter alia with

regard to possession of any property which has been stolen or with regard to

property found under circumstances which create suspicion of the commission of

an offence. The latter provision is primarily available to deal with property where

the owner is not known. In this case, the ownership of the vehicle was known. As

the learned Magistrate himself has held that no criminal offence has been made

out and in view of the observation of the learned Magistrate that the dispute

between the parties should be resolved through a civil action, this Court is in

agreement with the view expressed by the learned High Court Judge that the

provisions of Section 431(1} had no application ~n this case.

12

13

This Court is in agreement with the learned High Court Judge that if a criminal

offence had been made out on the complaint made by the First Party, the correct

course of action would have been for the Police to have reported facts to the

Magistrate's Court by filing a report under the provisions of Section 136(1) of the

Code of Criminal Procedure. Having done so, the Police could have invited the

Magistrate's Court to make an order under Section 431(1) with regard to the

vehicle.

In this regard, it would be appropriate to refer to the judgment of H.N.G.Fernando

J (as he then was) in Jayasuriya v Warnakulasuriya8 The facts of that case are

briefly as follows. Proceedings before the Magistrate had commenced with an

"intimation to Court" of an alleged complaint by Warnakulasuriya that Jayasuriya

had removed a fishing boat from his custody and taken the boat to Jayasuriya's

land. The "intimation" further stated that there was a dispute between the

parties claiming ownership of the boat and, "as the Police apprehended a breach

of the peace the boat was kept in the custody of the Village Headman". An order

had therefore been sought from the Magistrate's Court regarding the disposal of

the boat. The Magistrate thereafter held an inquiry at the conclusion of which he

held that the boat which originally belonged to Jayasuriya had been handed over

to Warnakulasuriya on an agreement and that Warnakulasuriya was entitled to

the possession and use of the boat. On this ground the learned Magistrate held

that the boat had been unlawfully removed from Warnakulasuriya 's custody and

made order that the boat be delivered to him. During the appeal, the principal

argument was that the Magistrate has no jurisdiction to order the delivery of the

8 61 NLR 189

13

...

14

boat to Warnakulasuriya except after the conclusion of proceedings duly

instituted in one of the modes prescribed in section 148 of the Criminal Procedure

Code.

The Supreme Court held that if the Magistrate's order was allowed to stand,

Warnakulasuriya would, through the intervention of the Magistrate, be

recovering possession of the boat from Jayasuriya although he has neither

instituted a prosecution for theft against Jayasuriya nor instituted proceedings in

a civil court.

The Supreme Court further held as follows:

"In my opinion section 4199 was not intended to afford a means of settling civil

disputes in this manner. I would hold that section 419 cannot be utilised by a

"complainant" in order to obtain an order of possession from a Magistrate of

any article seized from the possession of another as being stolen property if the

other person denies the theft and claims the property as his own. In such case

Section 41310 is the only provision which can be invoked, and it can be invoked

only if, as this court has previously held, proceedings have been instituted in

respect of the alleged offence of theft."

In the above circumstances, this Court is in agreement with the learned High

Court Judge that the learned Magistrate could not have proceeded to make an

order under Section 431(1) of the Code.

9 Almost identical provision is found in Section 431(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

10 Identical provision is found in Section 425(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979

14

15

Having held that the Magistrate had erred by exercising jurisdiction under Section

431(1) of the Code, the learned High Court Judge proceeded to make order that

possession of the said vehicle be handed over to the Second Party. For the

reasons that would be set out henceforth, this Court is of the view that the

learned High Court Judge erred when he made this direction and that the said

direction is a wrongful exercise of the discretion vested in him.

To start with, releasing the vehicle to the Second Party was not a substantive

relief prayed for by the Second Party in his revision application, even though one

may argue that a necessary consequence of holding that the learned Magistrate

has erred when he exercised powers under Section 431(1) of the Code is to

release the vehicle to the Second Party, thus restoring the status quo that

prevailed at the time the learned Magistrate made the order.

Quite apart from granting a relief not specifically prayed for, the learned High

Court Judge failed to consider the provisions of the Motor Traffic Act No. 14 of

1951, as amended that deal with the ownership and possession of motor vehicles.

Section 2(1) of the Act provides that, "No person shall possess or use a motor

vehicle unless that vehicle is registered~ and the person for the time being entitled

to the possession of the vehicle is registered as the owner thereot in accordance

with the provisions of this Part."

Thus, the Second Party having possession of the said vehicle while not being its

registered owner is contrary to the provisions of the Act. This is further fortified

15

16

when one considers the provisions of Section 12(2) and 12(4) of the Act. These

sections make it obligatory for the registered owner of a vehicle to inform the

Commissioner of Motor Traffic in writing of the change of possession of a vehicle

within seven days thereofll. The person into whose possession the vehicle has

passed is required within fourteen days after the change of possession, to

forward to the Commissioner of Motor Traffic the revenue license and the

certificate of registration relating to the vehicle, and to apply to the Commissioner

to be registered as the owner in place of the person registered as such.

This Court also observes that in terms of the Motor Traffic Act, every application

for a revenue license for a motor vehicle shall be signed by the registered owner

of the motor vehicle12 and that no revenue license for any motor vehicle shall be

issued by any licensing authority unless the certificate of registration relating to

that vehicle is produced13.

It is common ground that the First Party was the registered owner of the said

vehicle at the time of the complaint and that the First Party had at no time

transferred the ownership of the said vehicle to the Second Party. In the light of

the above provisions of the Motor Traffic Act and in the circumstances of this

case, this Court is of the view that the learned High Court Judge erred in law when

he directed that possession of the vehicle be given to a person other than its

registered owner.

11 Upon a voluntary transfer or otherwise

12 Section 30(1)(c) of the Motor Traffic Act

13 Section 27(1) of the Act

16

17

In any event, the Second Party had failed to exercise due diligence when he failed

to obtain a stay order at the first available opportunity. The present predicament

faced by the Second Party could have been avoided had he obtained without

delay a stay order preventing the First Party from transferring the vehicle. This

Court has already observed that the stay order had been obtained four months

after the order of the learned Magistrate releasing the said vehicle to the First

Party. By the time the judgment of the High Court was delivered, Court had

already been informed by the First Party that the said vehicle had been sold by

her. The Second Party had not taken any steps on the said disclosure. Thus, this

Court is of the view that the learned High Court Judge should not have exercised

his discretion as the Second Party by his own conduct and negligence, had

disentitled himself to any relief.

Finally, as far as the High Court was concerned, the only parties before it were the

First party, Second Party, the Police and the Attorney General. As the said vehicle

was no longer with the First Party, the learned High Court Judge could not have

made any orders and could not have intended to have made any orders that

affected the rights of third parties.

Considering the fact that the High Court was exercising revisionary jurisdiction,

which is a discretionary remedy, this Court is of the view that these facts should

have been sufficient for the High Court to decide not to exercise its discretion in

favour of the Second Party despite the errors committed by the learned

Magistrate.

17

. . .

,

18

It is in these circumstances that the Petitioner has invoked the revisionary

jurisdiction of the Court. In considering this application} this Court is mindful of

the following passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court in Marian Bee

Bee Vs. Mohamed and others14 where Sansoni CJ held as follows:

tiThe power of revision is an extraordinary power which is quite independent

of and distinct from the appellate jurisdiction of this Court. Its object is the due

administration of justice and the correction of errors} sometimes committed

by this court itself} in order to avoid miscarriage of justice. It is exercised in

some cases by a judge of his own motion} when an aggrieved person who may

not be a party to the action brings to his notice the fact that} unless the power

is exercised} injustice will result.1I

In Kayas vs. Nazeer & others15 the Supreme Court cited with approval the above

judgment of Sansoni J that a person who is aggrieved by any order of Court can

seek a revision of such order even though he is not a party to such action.

Weerasuriya J held that lithe object of revision is the due administration of Justice

and correction of errors and that power can be exercised in respect of any order of

a lower Court to prevent an injustice on an application by an aggrieved person

who is not even a party to the case. II

Quite apart from the order of the learned High Court Judge directing that the

vehicle be handed over to the Second Party being contrary to law} this Court is of

the view that grave injustice will be caused to the Petitioner if the Petitioner is to

1469CLW34

,

19

hand over the vehicle to the Second Party at this stage. This is in addition to the

practical difficulties that will arise when a vehicle is used by a person other than

the registered owner, but where the registered owner will nonetheless be liable

for any damage caused by the said vehicle. In these circumstances, this Court is of

the view that the learned High Court Judge erred in law when he directed that the

vehicle be handed over to the Second Party.

In view of the above findings, this Court is of the view that this is a fit case where

the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court should be exercised. Accordingly, this

Court sets aside the judgment of the learned High Court Judge dated 25th July

2017 as well as the order of the learned High Court Judge dated 28th November

2017 and the orders made by the learned Magistrate on 9th November 2017 and

30th November 2017, as they are all consequential orders made pursuant to the

judgment of the Learned High Court Judge.

Taking into consideration all of the circumstances of this case, this Court makes

no order with regard to costs.
