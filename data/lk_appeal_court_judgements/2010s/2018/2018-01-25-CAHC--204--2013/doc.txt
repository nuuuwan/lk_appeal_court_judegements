Heard submissions of both counsels. Counsel for the

Accused Appellant submits that the incident had happened on

18.02.2004 and as per the evidence available, especially

the eye witness, Somadasa speaks to the fact that there was

a sudden fight between the accused and the deceased.

During the scuffle, the accused has stabbed the deceased

once on the stomach. And the deceased died as a result of

the stab injury.

There is no evidence of a pre-plan. Further the evidence

reveals that these two people are known each other for more

than 25 years.

Considering the evidence available especially the single injury, it reveals that there is no pre-meditation or a preplan to murder the deceased by the accused.

The learned Senior Deputy Solicitor General who is

appearing for the Attorney General, maintaining the highest tradition of the office of the Attorney General and concede

to the fact that this is a case where the accused should

have been convicted under Section 297 of the Penal Code.

Regarding the sentence, the counsel for the Accused

Appellant submits that she was in remand from the date of

conviction and to consider the period and impose a

reasonable sentence. The Senior Deputy Solicitor General also submits that a reasonable custodial sentence be

imposed on the Accused Appellant and a compensation may be

considered to the wife and the children of the deceased.

We considered the available material before us and the

submissions made by counsels. After carefully considering,

we are of the view that this is a case of culpable homicide

not amounting to murder punishable under section 297 of the

Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight.

Therefore, we vacate the conviction for murder and the

sentence. We find the Accused Appellant guilty for

culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under

Section 297 of the Penal Code. We impose a sentence of 10

years Rigorous Imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 5000/-in

defaul t 3 months Simple Imprisonment. Further, we direct

the Accused Appellant to pay compensation of Rs. 100,000/-

to the wife of the deceased. If the wife is not available,

the compensation to be paid equally among the children of

the deceased.

If the compensation is not paid, a default sentence of 2

years Rigorous Imprisonment will be imposed.
