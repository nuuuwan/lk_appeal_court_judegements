Deepali Wiiesundera J.

The appellant along with another person was indicted in the High

Court of Kalmunai for committing murder of her husband under section

296 of the Penal Code. After trial the other accused was acquitted and

the appellant was convicted for murder and sentenced to death.

On the day of the incident the deceased and the appellant who

were husband and wife had an argument and thereafter the deceased

had gone outside and slept in the veranda and the appellant had slept

inside the house. The appellant had got up in the middle of the night and

started shouting saying that the deceased had hung himself on a tree.

She had run to a neighbor's house with a knife in her hand saying she

cut the rope and brought him down. When the prosecution wit.nesses

rushed to the scene they saw the deceased lying on the ground and a cut

rope hanging from a tree above. The knife the appellant had in her hand

was produced in the High Court and the doctor had said that knife would

not have caused the injuries on the deceased's chest.

2

The Judicial Medical Officer giving evidence had said that if

deceased committed suicide the tongue would have been out more than

the 2 cm found and there should be blood in the cornea. The Doctor has

ruled out suicide. According to the Doctor there were two stab injuries

and death was due to the stab injuries which caused cardio respiratory

failure following hemorrhage from the heart.

According to the evidence of the investigating officer there was no

signs of a person hanging from the branch of the tree from which a cut

piece of a rope was hanging. This case was based on circumstantial

evidence.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued that the learned High

Court Judge failed to attach any significance to the fact that it was the

appellant who had alerted the neighbors in a distressed manner

according to the witnesses. He also stated that the learned High Court

Judge failed to consider what the Doctor testified that stab injuries were

not caused by the knife the appellant had in her hand and that the

deceased's stomach contents had alcohol and that the neck injury could

have been caused by a blunt weapon or a rope tightening around the

neck.

The appellant's counsel further stated that the learned High Court

Judge erroneously concluded without any evidence that the appellant

committed the murder and attempted to show it was suicide by cutting

the rope and calling the neighbors and deliberately introduced another

knife to mislead the police.

The evidence of the Doctor clearly states that the deceased died

from the stab injuries and not from hanging himself. There was an injury

on the back of his head which would have been caused by;a blow with a

blunt weapon. The fracture on his neck the doctor has said would have

been caused by a blow or tightening a rope round the neck. ~II these

evidence proves that the deceased was killed and it was not a case of

suicide.

The learned Deputy Solicitor General in his argument stated that

where the appellant had knowledge with regard to certain circumstances

and where there is evidence beyond reasonable doubt against the

appellant, the appellant should provide a reasonable explanation. He

cited the judgment in Queen vs Satin Singho (1962) 65 NLR 445,

Jayasena vs AG (1969) 72 NLR 313, Premawansha vs AG SLR 2009

Vol 2 p. 205 and Coomaraswamy's Law Evidence Vol 1 page 21 to

support his argument.

The Deputy Solicitor General further stated that the appellant by

her dock statement failed to raise a doubt in the prosecution evidence.

He stated that according to the Ellenborough principles where there is a

strong prima facie case made against an accused it warrants a

reasonable explanation from the accused.

In the instant case appellant was given a fair chance to explain

herself but she was unable to create a doubt in the prosecution evidence.

There are no material contradictions marked in the prosecution evidence.

As pointed out by the learned Deputy Solicitor General in, AG vs

Sandanam Pitchi Mary Theresa 2011 SRR Vol. 2 p. 292. It was held;

"Whilst internal contradictions or discrepancies would ordinarily

allect the trustworthiness 0/ the witness statement, it is well

established that the Court must exercise its judgment on the

nature 0/ the inconsistency or contradiction and whether they are

material to the facts in issue. Discrepancies which do notgo to the

root 0/ the matter and assail the basic version 0/ the witness

cannot be given too much importance.

Witnesses should not disbelieved on account 0/ trifling

discrepancies and omissions. When contradictions are marked,

5

the Judge should direct his attention to whether they are material

or not and the witness should be given an opportunity 0/

explaining the matter. "

The argument of the appellant's learned counsel that some of the

findings of the learned High Court Judge are not supported by evidence

led in the case directly or circumstantially can not be easily dismissed.

We have to admit that there are discrepancies in the learned High Court

Judge's judgment. But it is stated in section 334(1) proviso of the Code

of Criminal Procedure Act (as amended) thus;

"Provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is 0/ opinion

that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour 0/

the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no

substantial miscarriage 0/ justice has actually occurred."

Acting under the said proviso we decide by the discrepancies in

the judgment no miscarriage of justice has happened.

6

For the afore stated reasons we decide to affirm the judgment and

conviction dated 06/06/2016 and dismiss the appeal.
