PADMAN SURASENA J (PLCA)

Court heard the submissions of the learned Counsel

for the substituted petitioner as well as the learned State

Counsel.

In this application, the petitioner has prayed that

[in prayer (c)l the order embodied in document produced

marked 'PIO' which has the effect of cancelling the permit

produced marked 'PI' be quashed and [in prayer (d)] a writ of

3

mandamus against 1 st - 5th respondents be issued to compel

them to issue two permits to the petitioner in respect of Lots

bearing No. 103 and 103A.

The said permit 'PI' is a permit which has been

issued for the period commencing from 08.11.2012 up to

31.12.2012. This means that it is a permit which has been

issued for just one month. It is common ground that the above

time period in this permit has not been extended.

Learned State Counsel drew the attention of this

Court to the document produced marked 'RI4'. The document

'RI4' is a Deed by which the petitioner is alleged to have

transferred this property namely, Lot 103 to another person.

Learned Counsel for the petitioner concedes that a land given

under a permit of this nature cannot be transferred to another

person. However, it is his submission that the petitioner has

denied this fact in his counter affidavit.

The effect of the denial of any knowledge of Deed

'R14' by the petitioner would amount to an indication that

somebody else has forged the signature of the petitioner to

transfer the petitioner's property to a third person. Upon being

queried by this Court from the petitioner to inform this Court

as to what action he has taken in this regard, learned Counsel

was unable to point to any action that had been taken by the

petitioner in this regard.

It is the VIew of this Court that it cannot be the

conduct of an owner of a land under such circumstances. This

is because Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance has

empowered a court to presume the existence of any fact which

it thinks likely to have happened, having regard to the common

course of natural events, human conduct etc. In the light of the

facts abovementioned this cannot be either the common course

of natural events or the human conduct. Therefore, this Court

is not inclined to believe the said denial by the petitioner. In

these circumstances, it is the view of this Court that the

impugned cancellation of the permit is justified.

Learned State Counsel also drew the attention of this

Court to Clause 5 of the permit which has categorically stated

that this permit has been given to the holder and holder alone.

This means that the said permit is personal to the holder only.

Learned Counsel for the petitioner has not been able to show us

any legal provision which would indicate that his client is

entitled to possess this land as the original permit holder whose

name appears in the permit marked 'PI' is now deceased.

Perusal of the permit marked 'PI' also show that

there is no nomination of a successor mentioned in it.

Therefore, in any case the substituted petitioner is not legally

entitled to possess this land. This is despite whether the

cancellation of this permit by document produced marked 'PIO'

is valid or not.

For the foregoing reasons this Court decides to refuse

this application. Therefore, this application should stand

dismissed with costs.

Learned Counsel brought to our notice that the

Provincial High Court had stayed proceedings in some cases

flied in this regard under the Provisions of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act. I t is our view that the State is

entitled to recover the possession of this land according to law .

The respondents are free to expedite the recovery proceedings

according to law.
