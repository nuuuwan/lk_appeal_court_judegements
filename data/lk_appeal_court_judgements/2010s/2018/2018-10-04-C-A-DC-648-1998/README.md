*****

This is an appeal from the judgment of the learned District Judge of the

Kalutra in respect of a Partition action bearing case Number 5857/P.

The Original Plaintiff instituted this action seeking to partition the land

called 'Nynapulle Thottam' also known as 'Nynapulli Padi' depicted in

Plan Number 761 dated 18.02.1992 prepared by A. G. C. Sirisoma,

Licensed Surveyor marked as 'X' produced and filed of record.

6

The Plaintiff claimed that he was entitled to an undivided 1/2 share in

the said land and the 1 st and 2nd Defendants were each entitled to an

undivided 1/4 share in the said corpus in his amended petition dated

18.11.1992.

The 3rd to 10th Defendants have averted that they were entitled

exclusively to the plantations and improvements in the corpus sought to

be partitioned in this action as depicted in Plan No. 256 dated

07.04.1993 and the report annexed to the said Plan made by K. D. L.

Wijeyanayaka. Therefore, the 3rd to 10th Defendants filed their answers

on 27.05.1993.

At the end of trial, the learned District Judge delivered his judgment

dated 15.09.1998 in favour of the 3rd to 10th Defendants accepting their

pedigree.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment and decree the Substituted

Plaintiff-Appellant filed this appeal and praying that:

-to set aside the judgment dated 15.09.1998

-that judgment and decree be entered as prayed for in the amended

plaint or order are-trial.

In this appeal, this court concentrates the plaint carefully; when I peruse

the plaint, the Substituted Plaintiff-Appellant had amended the original

Plaint dated 14.11.1994. In the original plaint, the Plaintiff claimed that

the original owners of the land in questioned as follows:-

1. Mohamed Marikkar -1/4

2. Mousoon Marikkar -1/4

3. Ahamed Abdullah -1/4

4. M. L. M. Faleela Umma, A. R. M. Thoufic and A. R. M. Ahamed

Ismail - 1/4 (Vide page 87 in the appeal brief).

7

But the Substituted Plaintiff-Appellant mainly amended the plaint stating

that the Deed No. 4592 of 1988 (P8) in favour of the 2nd Defendant was

a wrong deed and this deed applied to the adjoining land.

According to the amended plaint, the Substituted Plaintiff-Appellant

claimed that he is entitled to an undivided 1/2 share in the said corpus

and M. I. L. A. Rahuman Lebbe Marikkar and M. L. M. S. Mohamed

Lebbe Marikkar were each entitled to an undivided 1/4 share in the said

corpus (vide page 89 in the appeal brief).

Further, it is important to note that, after evaluation of all testimonies in

this case, I am of the view that, the Substituted Plaintiff-Appellant was

not aware of the facts of the case because he admitted at the trial that

his deceased father (Original Plaintiff) was well aware about this

partition action better than himself and after his father's death he

had to amend the plaint. But, he has failed to give a reasonable

answer in the cross examination (vide page 292 in the appeal brief).

It is well known legal norm that, who desires any court to give a

judgment as to any legal right or liability dependent on the existences of

facts and reasons which he asserts; he must prove that those facts and

reasons are exist (vide section 110 of the Evidence Ordinance). Even,

in this case the Appellant failed to do so.

In Deeman Silva vs. Silva and Others (1997) 2 S. L. R. 382,

Weerasekara and Wickneswaran JJ held that:

"No plaintiff should be allowed to come into Court and ask the

Court to unveil the defendants case unless the law recognises

such a right. It is a burden cast upon the plaintiff under our law to

prove his assertions in such cases .... "

8

It is trite law that, the burden of seeking and getting evidence before

court, in the course of investigation of title to the land sought to be

partitioned by parties before Court, prior to deciding what share should

go to which party is more the duty of the judge than the contesting

parties. The authorities proclaim that it is the duty of the trial judge in a

partition action to investigate title of the parties before he decides what

share should be allocated to which party of the case before him.

In Sopinona vs Cornelis and Others 2010 B.L.R. 109, it was held that:

"It is necessary to conduct a thorough investigation in a partition

action as it is instituted to determine the questions of title and

investigation devolves on the Court. In a partition suit which is

considered to be proceeding taken for prevention or redress of a

wrong, it would be the prime duty of the judge to carefully examine

and investigate the actual rights to the land sought to be

partitioned. "

In the case of Cynthia De Alwis vs. Marjorie De Alwis and two

others, (1997), 3 S.L.R. 113, it was held that:

"A District Judge trying a partition action is under a sacred duty to

investigate into title on all material that is forthcoming at the

commencement of the trial. In the exercise of this sacred duty to

investigate title, a trial judge cannot be found fault with for being too

careful in his investigation. He has every right even to call for

evidence after the parties have closed their cases. "

In Faleel vs. Argeen and Others 2004, 1 S.L.R. 48, it was held that;

"It is possible for the parties to a partition action to compromise their

disputes provided that the Court has investigated the title of each

party and satisfied itself as to their respective rights. "

9

In the instant case, the Substituted plaintiff-Appellant was not fully

aware on the fact and issues; he had failed to give a reasonable answer

in the cross examination. Therefore, enigmas are seemed to me that

the Substituted Plaintiff-Appellant failed to prove his case.

Furthermore, considering the whole evidence of the Substituted

Plaintiff-Appellant and after perusing the oral and written submissions, I

am of the opinion that he failed to raise a single legal argument to

support his position. But he only had given prudence to the factual

discrepancies which had no solid ground to interfere with the District

Court Judgment.

Therefore, for the forgoing legit reasons, I dismiss the appeal with costs.

Appeal dismissed.
