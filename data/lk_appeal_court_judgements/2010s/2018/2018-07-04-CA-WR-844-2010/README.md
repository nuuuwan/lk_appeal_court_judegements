Asthika Devendra with Ulan Warusavithana and Dinusha Mohan for the Petitioner

Rajiv Goonetilleke, SSC for the 1st to 18tt

Respondents

08.06.2018

A

fter having abandoned a writ of prohibition preventing the Senate and Council of

the University of Colombo approving the results of the MD (Administration)

2009/2010-Part 1 examination of the postgraduate Institute of medicine (PGIM), the

petitioner who was the medical superintendent, Base (teaching) Hospital, Gampola at the

time of this application for judicial review has now confined his application for relief to

a writ of certiorari to quash the recommendation made to accept the results of the MD

9

(Administration) 2009/2010,Part 1 examination. This recommendation (PH) is in fact

the results sheet that had been recommended by the board of examiners to the board of

study in administration and the board of management of the PGIM. When this matter

was taken up before another bench of this Court on 12.08.2015, the then Additional

Solicitor General Murdu Fernando, P.C brought to the notice of Court that even the writ

of certiorari could not be granted by this Court, since the Senate and the Council of the

University of Colombo had already approved the results of the MD (Administration)

2009/2010,Part 1 examination, which had been marked by the petitioner as PH. Thus the

submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General was premised on futility. The

Counsel for the Petitioner sought to respond to the case of the learned ASG on futility

and when this matter came on for argument before this bench, he persisted in his

argument to impugn PH,the results sheet. He contended that he was seeking to

challenge the process that resulted in PH. His complaint was that the Petitioner who had

been following the MD (Administration) 2009/2010,Part 1 course was expecting to sit

his examination on 11.10.2010, but unbeknownst to him, the 181st Respondent'a Lecturer

(Probationary) conducted a special lecture on 6.10.2010 on a Statistics Module, just five

days prior to the commencement of the examination.

In his petition he alleges that he could not attend this lecture as he was not notified of

the lecture. Neither did some of his fellow students owing to this non notification. The

learned Counsel for the Petitioner classified the results sheet (PH) as a recommendation

and contended that it was the process through which it was arrived at, that he was

seeking to impugn. In factPH the results sheet did not include the name of the Petitioner

as one of those candidates who had passed the examination. He faulted the process on so

many aspects. Broadly, they went as follows:,

a) the delivery of the lecture just five days prior to the examination was wrong;

b) the 181st Respondent presented a tutorial some aspects of which made their

appearance in the final paper the petitioner sat.

10

The Counsel for the Petitioner took this Court through some of these aspects which he

called were identical to the examination questions. For instance, the data set in Question

No.2 of the Tutorial (PIO) was identical to the data found in Question No.9 of P8~the

examination paper. Question No.2 in PIO was identical to Question No.9 in P8. There

were two more similarities that the Counsel for the Petitioner pointed out. Question No.

3 in P7 (which was also marked as a tutorial) was similar to Question No. Sin P8. But I

observe both questions cannot be classified as substantially similar. In Question No.2 in

P7 there was what was called a Pearson Correlation indicated by figure 737. The Counsel

pointed out that this was the same as the figure in the Model Summary Chart in

Question No.9 of P8. But I must observe that the word Pearson, which was found in the

tutorial was not seen in the examination paper except for the figure 737.

The Petitioner avers that a few other candidates and he were adversely affected at the

examination since the final question paper P8 had concentrated on areas taught at this

pre~examination lecture. This particular complaint of the Petitioner is made light of in

the statement of objections filed by the lS2nd, lSth, lS9th, 19th, 19Sth, 201sr, 202nd and

204th Respondents. They aver in their affidavits that as the trainees who followed the

MD (Administration) 2009/2010~Part 1 course felt that they were somewhat weak in

Statistics, they all agreed to have a discussion on Statistics Module which first took place

on 2.10.2010. Mrs. Padma Yatapahana~the lSlst Respondent received no payment for the

said discussion which was done on a voluntary basis at the request of the said trainees.

These Respondents make the assertion that even the petitioner attended the discussion.

As the said discussion could not be concluded by 12 noon on 2.10.2010, the lecturer and

the trainees agreed to continue the said discussion on another date and it was deferred

for 6.10.2010 from lla.m to 1p.m. There was nothing surreptitious or stealthy about it. All

the trainees were informed of the next date. What the 202nd Respondent states by way of

an affidavit is quite revealing. Dr. Pradeep Wijesinghe~the 202nd Respondent asserts that

the Petitioner who did not attend the second discussion requested him to record the

discussion by keeping his mobile phone on the table of the lecturer in a recording mode

so that he could listen to the discussion. There is affidavit evidence before this Court that

11

prior to the discussion, Mrs. Padma Yatapahana forwarded the tutorial notes to a

common email address.

Thus the joint affidavit filed on behalf of the aforesaid Respondents gives the lie to the

assertion of the Petitioner. There is a denial of all this in the counter affidavit of the

Petitioner though he admits that he requested the 202nd Respondent to keep the mobile

in the recording mode but he could not listen to the lecture because of some background

disturbances.

Certain salient features immanent in this case need reiteration. The affidavit of Professor

Kshanika Hirimburegama, the Vice Chancellor, University of Colombo, brings out the

fact that the final examination paper P8 was never leaked prior to the examination. She

points out that the complaint was made quite belatedly. Both in the oral argument and

the statement of objections of the 1st to 13tt Respondents, the argument was made that

the Petitioner had reached the required pass mark on the written component of the

examination. In other words, the Petitioner passed the examination paper (P8) which

according to him was reflective of some aspects of the tutorial that had been conducted.

In such an event the Petitioner cannot complain of any prejudice in the way he faced the

examination paper. No process or procedural aspects prior to this examination had

imperilled him and this Court does not perceive any unfairness caused to the Petitioner.

Then what would be his principal complaint? It would appear that the petitioner failed

at the oral component of the said examination, which was mandatory.

Professor Mohamed Hussein Rezvi Sheriff, who was the Director, Postgraduate Institute

of Medicine (PGIM) at the relevant time, has affirmed in this affidavit that the said

lecture was not held surreptitiously and all the candidates were duly informed

beforehand. The lecture was conducted at the request of the trainees to clarify their

doubts. Prof. Rezvi Sheriff asserted that the Petitioner was making a false statement by

stating that the Petitioner and a few other students were not informed of the lecture. He

affirmed that the Petitioner had reached the required pass mark on the written

12

component of the examination but failed to score the required marks under the

compulsory oral component of the said examination.

I must observe that it was not shown that the PGIM stepped outside its Rules and

Regulations and I do hold the view that there was nothing illegal immanent in this case,

in the sense of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as propounded in R v.

Minister for the Civil Service ex p Council of Civil Service Unions (1985) 1 AC 374,

that affected the holding of the examination.

If at all, the gravamen of the Petitioner's complaint has to be on the oral component of

the examination which seems to have weighed in on his failure to reach the pass mark.

Nothing is spoken about the process of the oral component in the petition and affidavit

of the Petitioner. In fact, the existence of the oral component and the way it is assessed

brings to the fore what Wade and Forsyth have been saying of academic or pastoral

judgements in their tome Administrative Law (Oxford, Eleventh Edition, page 537).

"The courts will, in any case, be reluctant to enter into 'issues of academic or pastoral judgement

which the University was eqUipped to consider in breadth and in depth but on which any judgment

of the Courts would be jejune and inappropriate. That undoubtedly included such questions as

what mark or class a student ought to be awarded or whether an aegrotat was justified'."/Clark

v. University of lincolnshire and Humberside(2000) 1 WLR 1988 (Sedley LJ).

Conceived in another perspective, the arrangement between a fee/paying student and

PGIM is a contract: see Herring v. Templeman (1973) 3 All E R 569, 584/5. Like many

other contracts, it contains its own procedures principally in the form of Student

Regulations. Unlike other contracts, however, disputes suitable for adjudication under

its procedures may be unsuitable for adjudication in the courts. As Wade and Forsyth

states as above, there would be issues of academic or pastoral judgment which the

university is equipped to consider in breadth and in depth, but on which any judgment

of the courts would be jejune and inappropriate.

It has been clear, at least since Hines v. Birkbeck College (1986) Ch. 524 (approved in

Thomas v. University of Bradford (1987) AC 795), that this distinction has no bearing

13

on the availability of recourse to the courts in an institution which has a Visitor. But

where, as with PGIM, there is none, the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in

Norrie v. University of Auckland Senate (1984) 1 NZLR 129 and the remarks of

Hoffmann,]. in Hines at 542-3 open the way to the distinction as a sensible allocation of

issues capable and not capable of being decided by the courts. It would follow, I think,

that the issues which the courts remitted with obvious relief to Visitors in such cases as

Thomson v. University of London (1864) 33 L].Ch. 625 (which concerned the award of

a gold medal), Thorne v. University of London (1966) 2 QB 237 and Patel v. University

of Bradford Senate (1978) 1 WLR 1488 (both of which concerned the plaintiff's

academic competence) would still not be susceptible of adjudication as contractual

issues in cases involving higher education corporations.

It is on this ground, rather than on the ground of non-justiciability of the entire

relationship between student and university, that we would refuse certiorari and strike

out the case as pleaded.

The consistent judicial opinion, therefore, is that in matters which lie within the

jurisdiction of the educational institutions and their authorities, the Court has to be slow

and circumspect before interfering with any decision taken by them in connection

therewith. Unless a decision is demonstrably illegal, arbitrary and unconscionable, their

province and authority should not be encroached upon. This is mainly because of want of

judicially manageable standards and necessary expertise to assess, scrutinise and judge

the merits and/or demerits of such decisions.

Dealing with the scope of interference in matters relating to orders passed by the

authorities of educational institutions, the Courts should normally be very slow to pass

orders in regard thereto and such matters should normally be left to the decision of the

educational authorities. This is not an inflexible rule though and in R v. Higher

Education Funding Council ex parte Institute of Dental Surgery (1994) 1 WLR 242

Stephen Sedley,]. took care to emphasize the flexibility of the rule:

"This is not to say for a moment that academic decisions are beyond challenge."

14

,. But in the same breath classifying an academic judgement, the learned judge stated;

"The question why in isolation as it can now be seen to be, is a question of academic judgement. We

would hold that where what is sought to be impugned is on the evidence, no more than an informed

exercise of academic judgement, fairness alone will not require reasons to be given. This is not to

say for a moment that academic decisions are beyond challenge. A mark,for example, awarded at

an examiners' meeting where irrelevant and damaging personal factors have been allowed to enter

into the evaluation of a candidate's written paper is something more than an informed exercise of

academic judgement."

As I have stated before, the case of the petitioner boils down finally to the process of the

viva voce assessment which has not been impugned in the petition as falling within the

permissible parameters of challenge articulated by Sedley,]. It has not been alleged that

the oral component took into account irrelevant and personal factors that would shift

the decision of final results outside an informed exercise of academic judgement.

Therefore we would not venture into an impugnation of PH as it lies clearly outside the

pale of judicial review.

In any event PH has since been approved by the Senate and the Council of the University

of Colombo and it would be futile to engage in an impingement of PH which has resulted

in practical consequences for those candidates who had passed the examination.

Administrative inconvenience is another inhibiting factor against the exercise of

discretion of the remedy and all these composite factors would impel us to hold that no

grounds have been made out to issue a mandate in the nature of a writ of certiorari.

In the end we refuse the application for that remedy.
