T

he Counsel for the Plaintiff~ Respondent has raised a preliminary objection to the

maintainability of this appeal namely the notice of appeal is out of time and

contrary to the time limit set down in Section 754(4) of the civil procedure code

(CPC).

Section 754(3) of the CPC

Section 754(3) provides that, "every appeal to the Court of Appeal from any judgment

or order of any original Court shall be lodged by giving notice of appeal to the original

Court within such time and in the form and manner hereinafter provided'~

Section 754( 4) of the CPC

The time period within which such notice of appeal should be lodged is provided for in

the subsequent Section 754(4) of the CPC which goes as follows:

"The notice of appeal shall be presented to the court of first instance for this purpose by the party

appellant or his registered attorney within a period of fourteen days from the date when the

decree or order appealed against was pronounced, exclusive of the day of that date itself and of

the day when the petition is presented and of Sundays and public holidays, and the Court to

which the notice is so presented shall receive it and deal with it as hereinafter prOVided. If such

conditions are not fulfilled, the court shall refuse to receive it."

3

Thus it is clear that the notice of appeal shall be presented to the Court of first instance

which made the decree or order within 14 days from the date when the decree or order

appealed against was pronounced.

Whilst yet on this overly frequent preliminary objections that are raised day in day out,

it is useful to recall some of the case law that underlie time limits pertaining to notice of

appeals.

It needs no reiteration that according to Section 754(4) of the Code, when computing

the period of l4 days, the following days are excluded.

(i) The day on which the decree or order appealed against was pronounced.

(ii) The day when the notice of appeal was presented.

(iii) Intervening Sundays and public holidays.

In Mohideen Natchia v. Ismail Marikar,l where the question was whether Saturdays

must be included or excluded in computing the fourteen days prescribed by Section

754(4) of the Civil Procedure Code, it was held that, "in computing fourteen days in

terms of section 754(4) of the Civil Procedure Code, Saturdays should be included". In

this case it was also held that "the case of Dharmadasa v. Kumarasinghe2 was not

correctly decided and should not be followed; the view of Ratwatta, J. expressed in

Muthusamy v. Leathen Tea Estates Association Ltd/ on the question in issue

represents the correct view". Accordingly, in computing 14 days Saturdays are

included.

In the case of Sri Lanka State Trading Corporation v. Dharmadasa,4 Shavananda C.J.,

observed at page 239 and 240 that, "It is to be noted that section 754(4) excluded

Sundays and public holidays only in the computation of the fourteen days and not

Saturdays even though they are non~working days or dies non. Section 8 (1) of the

Interpretation Ordinance will not avail the Appellant since the last date for presenting

the notice of appeal to Court was 16th June, a Friday~a day on which the Court was not

closed. Had the last date been a Saturday, the 1th June, then the notice of appeal could

validly have been filed on Monday the 19th, when the Court was open" and held that,

"Notice of appeal was not filed within the time limit of fourteen days permitted by

section 754(4) of the Civil Procedure Code, because allowing for the fact that the date

of judgment and date of filing of notice are not counted and the two Sundays had to be

excluded, there was time to file the notice of appeal only until 16th June (Friday).

When the 14th day falls on a Saturday or on a public holiday on which day the

courts are closed, whether an appellant can file the notice of appeal on the next

following Monday?

This matter was favourably answered in the case of Selenchina v. Mohamed Marikar

and Others,S where the notice of appeal was presented on 20.10.1986. If that day is

excluded, the period of 14 days excluding the date of judgment pronounced (i.e.

30.09.1986) and intervening Sundays and public holidays would end on 17.10.1986

which was a public holiday. The next day on which the notice should have been

presented was the 18th, being a Saturday, on which the office of the court was closed.

The next day, the 19th was a Sunday which too had to be excluded in terms of the

section.

Thus it was held that the notice filed on 20.10.1986 was within the period of 14 days as

provided for in the Section 754(4) of the Civil Procedure Code.

V.LA. Majeed in his "A Commentary on Civil Procedure Code and Civil Law in Sri Lanka"

observes as follows6:~

"Upon a summing up of the above decisions, two matters are clear. One is that Saturdays are not

excluded in counting the 14 days period within which the notice of appeal should be filed and the

other is, if the 14th day aast of the 14 days period) falls on a Saturday or Sunday or a public

holiday, on which days the office of the court is closed, the notice of appeal can be filed on the

next working day immediately following the said non~working day. (Dies non)."

The judgement in this case was delivered by the learned District Judge of Pugoda on

17.08.2000. If one computes the time period of 14 days within the parameters of Section

754(4), there were two Sundays namely 20th and 2th August 2000 and the 14th day

ended on the 2nd of September 2000~a Saturday on which the Courts were closed. The

follOwing day 3rd September 2000 was a Sunday and allowing for these non working

days (dies non) to be excluded, the notice of appeal had to be tendered on 4 th September

2000~a Monday. But the date stamp on the notice of appeal is th September 2000~a

Wednesday. Thus one is driven to the conclusion that the notice of appeal has been

tendered on th September 2000 which is virtually 17 days after the judgment was

pronounced. That forms the genesis of the argument to reject this appeal as a

mandatory step in the process of appeal had not been timeously taken. But Mr. M.D.].

Bandara Attorney~at~ Law who appears for the Appellants has drawn the attention of

this Court to Journal Entry 82 which is dated 8th September 2000 wherein an

important minute of a court official appears. The minute is to the effect that the notice

of appeal has been tendered within the stipulated time~ "er6)c:e)es ~z;~ ~rn

1m)@(.' ~@ ei~ erz;m". This confirms the possibility that the date stamp was put on

the notice later. This is a frequent occurrence in original Courts and the case of

Nachchiduwa v. Mansool bears testimony to such occurrences.

In Nachchiduwa v. Mansoor (supra) the Petition of Appeal was handed over to the

Registrar by the Registered Attorney on 02.12.1994. The Registrar placed his initials

and entered the time. According to the practice in the Registry, the petition of appeal

had to be thereafter taken to the record room where it would be entered in the Motion

Book and filed in the record. These steps were not taken on 02.12.1994. The relevant

entries were made only on 09.12.1994 after the period of 60 days within which the

petition of appeal should be presented had lapsed.

The Plaintiff made an application for execution of decree in terms of Section 763 on the

basis that there was an appeal filed and the Defendants were noticed. The learned

District Judge rejected the petition of appeal as being out of time on the basis that there

was no entry in the Motion Book that the petition of appeal was filed on 02.12.1994,

and allowed the application for writ. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held:~

(1) In terms of Section 755(3), the Appellant has to 'present' to the original court a

petition of appeal within 60 days of the judgment.

(2)The act of the Registered Attorney in tendering the petition of appeal to the

Registrar and the act of the Registrar in placing the date stamp and his initials on

the petition of appeal constitute presentation of the petition of appeal.

(3)When the petition of appeal is presented by the Appellant and received by Court

under Section 755(3), Section 755(4) provides that the petition should be filed

and the record be forwarded to the Court of Appeal.

( 4) The act of filing the petition and that of forwarding the record to the Court of

Appeal are official acts of the District Court. Any delay in filing a petition in the

record cannot be attributed to the appellant.

In the case before me the date stamp was placed 17 days after the date of the judgment

for one reason or the other but the Journal Entry 82 which appears at page 57 of appeal

brief indicates that the notice of appeal had been tendered within time.

Judicial and Official Acts have been regularly performed~Illustration (d) to Section

114 of the Evidence Ordinance

The rule embodied in the illustration flows from the maxim omnia proesumuntur rite et

solemniter esse acta, i.e., all acts are presumed to have been rightly and regularly done.

In my view the minute inJournal Entry 82 raises the presumption in Illustration (d) to

Section 114(d) of the Evidence Ordinance. The presumption under Illustration (d) of

the Evidence Ordinance is that judicial and official acts have been regularly performed.

"Regularly performed" can only mean performed in accordance with form and

procedure. It cannot imply that the officer or the Judge had authority to perform an act

which is not ordinarily within his competence. I had occasion to deal with this

presumption (with E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, J. concurring) in CA 477/2000(F)~see CA

minutes of 12.09.2017. In that order I alluded to the rebuttable character and nature of

the presumption in Section 114 ( d) of the Evidence Ordinance as exemplified below.

"Although there is a presumption that official acts have been regularly performed, and that they

have been performed in accordance with rules and regulations bearing on the subject, yet this is a

rebuttable presumption. In fact, it is left to the Court to raise that presumption or not, having

regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of each case".s

"A presumption that an act was regularly done arises only on proof that the act was in fact done,

as the presumption is limited to the regularity of the act done and does not extend to the doing of

the Act itsdf".9

"In other words, the presumption that may be raised is that the act if proved to have been done

was done in a regular manner. There is no presumption that an act was done, of which there is no

evidence and the proof of which is essential to the case raised"l0

Regularity of Journal Entries

It has been laid down that the Court is entitled to presume that the journal entries,

made in a case in compliance with the requirements of Section 92 of the Civil

Procedure Code, set out the sequence correctly~see Seebert Silva v. Aronona Silva/J

Section 114 of the Evidence Ordinance creates rebuttable presumptions as the provision

uses the words "the Court may presume ..... " and there is nothing proffered in this case

to rebut this presumption being drawn. No argument was raised that the minute was

an introduction. In fact His Lordship Justice EN.D. Jayasuriya drew attention to the

long line of cases collated by Justice Dias in King v. Jayawardena12 and made the

following observations in Jayaweera v. Asst. Commissioner of Agrarian Services,

Ratnapura and Another.13

"It is not open to the petitioner to file a convenient and self serving affidavit for the first time

before the Court of Appeal and thereby seek to contradict either a quasi judicial act or a judicial

act.

If a litigant wishes to contradict the record he must file necessary papers before the Court of first

instance, initiate an inquiry before the Court and thereafter raise the matter before the

Appellate Court so that the Appellate Court would be in a position on the materials to make an

adjudication on the issues with the benefit of the order of that Court."

In the case before me there is no such effort or attempt to contradict the journal entry

and therefore I am irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that the notice of appeal was

filed in time.

In the circumstances I overrule the preliminary objection raised in the case and proceed

to fix this matter for argument.
