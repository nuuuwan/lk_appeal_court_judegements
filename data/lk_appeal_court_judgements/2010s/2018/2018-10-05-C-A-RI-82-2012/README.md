Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner who is the 3rd plaintiff in the partition action filed

this application dated 21.03.2012 for restitutio in integrum

thereby seeking to set aside the Judgment of the District Court

dated 02.06.2005.

Several Deeds have been produced during the course of the trial.

The petitioner seeks to set aside the Judgment on the basis that

Deeds marked 3V4 and 3V6 are fraudulent Deeds.

I will first consider the Deed marked 3V4 dated 16.10.1987. No

issue had been raised at the trial on this Deed, let alone on the

basis that it is a fraudulent Deed.

This Deed has however been marked subject to proof. One of

the executants of that Deed is the 4th defendant. The other

executant is her mother who was dead at the institution of the

action. The 4th defendant, in her evidence, has admitted going to

Panadura with her mother to sign the Deed and she admits her

signature on the Deed. It appears that her complaint is that the

Notary was not there and the contents were not explained. One

of the subscribing witnesses to that Deed is the 3rd defendant.

He has also identified his signature on the Deed and testified in

favour of due execution thereof. In the circumstances of this

case, the learned District Judge has disbelieved the 4th

defendants story and held that the Deed has been proved.

On what basis does the petitioner now state that Deed 3V4 is a

fraudulent Deed? That is on the basis that the petitioner has

now come to know that the duplicate of Deed 3V4 dated

16.10.1987 has been sent to the Land Registry by the Notary (as

seen from the document marked B) on 18.09.1990.

4

According to section 31(26) of the Notaries Ordinance, No.1 of

1907, as amended, the Notary shall send to the Registrar of

Lands on or before the fifteenth day of every month the duplicate

of every Deed which he has attested during the preceding

month. If the Notary fails to observe it or anything which is

listed out under section 31(1)-(36), the Notary can be dealt with

inter alia under the Notaries Ordinance, but it does not make

the Deed invalid. (Vide Asliya Umma v. Thingal Mohamed1,

Peoples Bank v. Hewawasam2, Hemathilaka v. Allina3,

Wilisindahamy v. Karunawathi4)

Section 33 of the Notaries Ordinance is clear on that point:

No instrument shall be deemed to be invalid by reason only

of the failure of any notary to observe any provision of any

rule set out in section 31 in respect of any matter of form:

Provided that nothing hereinbefore contained shall be

deemed to give validity to any instrument which may be

invalid by reason of non-compliance with the provisions of

any other written law.

I hold that the Deed 3V4 cannot be challenged by way of

restitutio in integrum.

Let me now turn to Deed marked 3V6. Specific issues have been

raised at the trial on this Deed and the learned District Judge

has concluded that the due execution of the Deed has been

proved. This is purely on the basis that the 1st plaintiff has

identified her signature and those of the 2nd and 3rd plaintiffs on

the Deed.

There are four executants to this Deed. They are the 1st-4th

plaintiffs. The 1st plaintiff is the mother and the other three are

her children. On the third page of the Deed the signatures of

1st-4th plaintiffs can be seen.

Even though the 1st plaintiff in her evidence has admitted the

signatures, she has categorically stated that she never knew

what she was signing for and it was never signed before a Notary

by the name of Ganeshan. The Deed is handwritten in

Englisha language in which they are illiterate.

The 1st plaintiff has further stated that the 4th plaintiff was at

that time a minor and he never signed the Deed, but someone

else wrote the 4th defendants name on the Deed as his (the 4th

Defendants) signature. That part of evidence of the 1st plaintiff

has not been contradicted and the learned District Judge has

accepted that evidence, but decided that, except the 4th plaintiff,

the rights of the 1st-3rd plaintiffs have been transferred to the 3rd

defendant on that Deed.

It appears that the learned District Judge has taken the forging

of the 4th plaintiffs signature for granted. According to the

attestation of the Deed, all four executants including the 4th

plaintiff has signed the Deed before the Notary Ganeshan. This

itself, in my view, casts serious doubt about the due execution of

the Deed.

It is significant to note that the 3rd defendant did not call any

other witness to prove the Deed.

Section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance, No.14 of 1895, as

amended, enacts:

6

If a document is required by law to be attested, it shall not

be used as evidence until one attesting witness at least has

been called for the purpose of proving its execution, if there

be an attesting witness alive, and subject to the process of

the court and capable of giving evidence.

What is required under section 68 of the Evidence Ordinance is

proof of due execution of the Deed by calling at least one

attesting witness.

What is due execution? In terms of section 2 of the Prevention

of Frauds Ordinance, No.7 of 1840, as amended, a Deed shall be

of no force or avail in law unless the same shall be in writing

and signed by the party making the same in the presence of a

Notary and two or more witnesses present at the same time and

duly attested by such Notary and witnesses.

In Solicitor General v. Ava Umma5, Justice T.S. Fernando

enunciated:

The object of calling the witness is to prove the execution of

the document. Proof of the execution of the documents

mentioned in section 2 of No. 7 of 1840 means proof of the

identity of the person who signed as maker and proof that

the document was signed in the presence of a notary and

two or more witnesses present at the same time who

attested the execution.

Has the due execution of the Deed 3V6 been proved by mere

identification of the signature of the executant on the Deed,

when the alleged executant vehemently states that

5 (1968) 71 NLR 512 at 515-516

7

notwithstanding it is her signature, she never signed a Deed in

the presence of a Notary and two or more witnesses present at

the same time who attested the execution? The answer shall

obviously be in the negative.

During the trial a witness from the Land Registry has been

called to prove that Notary Ganeshan has not carried out his

Notary practice at the time of the alleged execution of the Deed

No. 2446 marked 3V6. That witness has further stated that the

said Notary has only executed Deeds up to Deed No.1383. The

learned District Judge has not drawn his attention to this vital

piece of evidence.

The immediate reason of the 3rd plaintiff-petitioner to come

before this Court by way of restitutio in integrum is the recent

discovery of the Death Certificate of the said Notary marked A,

whereby it is clearly proved that Notary Ganeshan was dead well

before eight years of the alleged execution of Deed 3V6. The

Deed 3V6 has purportedly been executed by Notary Ganeshan

on 02.10.1990, whereas according to the Death Certificate, the

said Notary has died on 06.04.1982.

The 3rd defendant-respondent in his statement of objections

does not challenge the genuineness of the Death Certificate of

the Notary, but attempts to counter it stating that the same

Notary, on the same day, after the impugned Deed No.2446, has

executed another Deed, No.2447, in favour of the plaintiffs as

seen from the Land Registry extracts. In reference to this Deed

No.2447, the 3rd defendant, in his evidence has stated that he

sold one of his properties to the plaintiffs by that Deed.6 It is

curious to note that the 3rd defendant has never produced such

6 Page 212 of the brief

8

a Deed before the trial Court or before this Court, nor have the

plaintiffs relied upon such a Deed at any stage of the case.

The certified copy of the Death Certificate of the Notary

conclusively proves that there was no due execution of the

purported Deed marked 3V6 in terms of section 2 of the

Prevention of Frauds Ordinance and document 3V6 is a forgery.

I hold that Deed 3V6 is void ab initio and no title passes on to

the 3rd defendant on that fraudulent document.

The 3rd defendant appears to be heavily relying on technical

objections to defeat the application of the petitioner.

Delay ipso facto shall not be a ground to reject an application in

limine when there are other cogent and compelling grounds

staring at the Court demanding justice. This is more so, when

there is a manifest fraud proven before Court. (Biso Manika v.

Cyril De Alwis7, Sebastian Fernando v. Katana Multi-Purpose Co-

operative Society Ltd8, Velun Singho v. Suppiah9)

Chief Justice Bertram in Suppramaniam v. Erampakurukal10

can stand even when robed in a judgment. Vide also

approval the following dicta of Lord Denning in Lazarus Estates

Ltd v. Bearely.16

No Judgment of a Court or order of a Minister can be

allowed to stand if it has been obtained by fraud. Fraud

unravels everything. The Court is careful not to find fraud

unless it is specially pleaded and proved. But once it is

proved it vitiates judgments, contracts, and all transactions

whatsoever.

Let me now briefly address the specific issue whether restitutio in

integrum lies in the above circumstances of this case. In

Dember v. Abdul Hafeel17 Justice Canekeratne observed that:

The cases in which application for relief by way of

restitution in respect of judgments of original courts have

been made in Ceylon can, broadly speaking, be classed

under two heads: (a) where a judgement has been obtained

by fraud or where there has been a discovery of fresh

evidence; (b) where a judgment has been entered of consent

and there has been an absence of a real consent such as in

cases of fraud, fear, excess of authority and mistake.

I am satisfied that the present application falls within (a) above.

I will now proceed to address the issue particularly in terms of

the Partition Law. Although section 48(3) of the Partition Law

enacts that The interlocutory decree and the final decree of

partition entered in a partition action shall have the final and

conclusive effect declared by subsection (1) of this section, the

15 At page 140 16 (1956) 1 All ER 341 at 345 17 (1947) 49 NLR 62 at 66

10

same section immediately thereafter expressly states that The

powers of the Court of Appeal by way of revision and restitution

in integrum shall not be affected by the provisions of this

subsection. It is trite law that the powers of revision and

restitutio in integrum of the Court of Appeal have survived right

throughout even without such express provisions as held in the

celebrated case of Somawathie v. Madawela.18

The Final Decree has been entered after the petitioner came

before this Court by way of restitutio in integrum. There is no

necessity to set aside the Judgement of the District Court in its

entirety as except the rights of the 3rd defendant, those of others

are unaffected by this Judgment of this Court.

The learned District Judge in the Judgment has decided that the

1st plaintiff was entitled to 2.24 perches, and the 2nd-4th

plaintiffs each to 0.75 perches before they transferred the said

rights to the 3rd defendant by 3V6. There is no dispute about

that finding.

As 3V6 has now been made null and void, the plaintiffs shall be

restored to the earlier position which they were. Accordingly,

the List of Shares shall be amended as follows:

The 1st plaintiff 2.24 P

The 2nd plaintiff 0.75 P

The 3rd plaintiff 0.75 P

The 4th plaintiff 0.75 P

The 1st defendant 4.48 P

3rd defendant 4.47 P

5th defendant 4.36 P

19.78 P

The Interlocutory Decree shall be amended as above and a fresh

commission to prepare a Final Partition Plan shall be issued and

thereafter an amended Final Decree to be entered in accordance

with law.

The application of the petitioner is partly allowed. The 3rd

defendant-respondent shall pay a sum of Rs.50,000/= as costs

of this application to the petitioner.
