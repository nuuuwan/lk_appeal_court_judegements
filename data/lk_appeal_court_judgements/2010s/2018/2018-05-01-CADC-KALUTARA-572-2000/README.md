A perusal of the pedigree filed by the Plaintiff will succinctly make the issues crystal

clear. The subject~matter originally belonged to one Madanakondaraatchige Don

Thusew Aresecularatne~see Admission 3 recorded at the trial on 1.l0.l996.

Arsekularatne had six children~see Admission 3 recorded on his interests had

devolved on his six children namely Duminga, Fransciscu, Daniel, Simon, Agida and

Veronica. Agida had 2 children Catherina and Eprojina. Having inherited 1/6th share,

it would appear that Agida would pass on V1th share each to her daughters

Catherina and Eprojina. Catherina married one H.D. Marcelinu in community of

property and for a debt of Marcelinu (the husband), Catherina'S V12th share had been

seized and sold on a fiscal conveyance to one Don Jusenis Arsecularatne. This fiscal

conveyance bearing No.10804 took place on 23.05.1861 conveying the title to 1/12th

share to the said Jusenis Arsekularatne~see the plaintiff's pedigree at page 80 of the

brief, the fiscal conveyance marked as P22 and the testimony of Anthony Sri Lal Indra

Arsekularatne at pages 250 and 262 of the brief. It is through Jusenis that the Plaintiff

derived title to the 1/12th share. The Roman Dutch Law doctrine of community of

property permitted this to occur.

But the gravamen of the complaint of Dr. Sunil Coorey was that the learned District

Judge failed to appreciate the Roman Dutch Law doctrine of community of property

3

that comingled the properties of both spouses into joint property. He contended that

thought the evidence on the fiscal sale (P22) was led before the Court, the learned

District Judge misdirected himself both on the facts and law in allotting the said 1/1th

share to the 6th Defendant in the case, though in effect the allotment must be for the

Plaintiff. At page 17 of the judgment dated 03.0S.2000, the learned District Judge of

Kalutara has allotted the aforesaid 1/12th share to the 6th Defendant-vide page 321 of

the Appeal Brief and in fact if one applies the Roman Dutch Law doctrine of

community of property, the l/12th share of Catherina (Agida's Daughter) becomes

chargeable with the debt of her husband, Marcelinu and it was in those

circumstances that the share was sold on the fiscal conveyance to Jusenis

Arsecularatne who passed it on to the Plaintiff. This mode of devolution to the

Plaintiff is seen on the Plaintiff's pedigree too-vide page so of the appeal brief.

The question then arises how the learned District Judge of Kalutara came to allot the

1/12th share to the 6th Defendant. It is not in contention that the said Catherina who

was the owner of the lJlth share married Marcelinu in community and both of them

died leaving one child named Maria who married Peduru and it is this union that

sired the 6th Defendant Lorenz. The learned District Judge had followed this

devolution to allot to 6th Defendant, the said 1I12th share, but as Dr. Coorey contended,

it is apparent that Catherine had no 1/12th share to transmit to her child Lucia, after

the lJlth share had been disposed of at the fiscal's conveyance in 1861. In fact, the

contents of the fiscal's conveyance, which is contained in an old deed of lS61,

designate Kalutara as Caltura and the contents of the deed were read out to Court by

Dr. Coorey so skillfully as he was possessed of a clear copy and this conveyance P22

refers to Marcelinu as the debtor for whose borrowing the 1/12th share was sold. As I

said before, Marcelinu had married Catherina in community of property and when

the fiscal sale took place by way of P22 in lS61, the entire interests of Catherina

passed to Jusenis Arsekularatne and there was nothing that remained to be inherited

by Maria (Catherina'S daughter) from whom the 6th Defendant claims. Therefore, the

4

learned District Judge of Kalutara could not have allotted the lflih share to the 6th

Defendant.

It has to be recalled that the Roman Dutch Law doctrine of community of property

has not been borne in mind though this figured in the trial and it is worthy of note

that this doctrine applied in this country in 1861 when the fiscal conveyance took

place.

A community of debts is the corollary of community property. By virtue of this

principle all antenuptial and postnuptial debts become charges on the joint estate~see

liquidators of Union Bank v. Kives (1899) 8 S.C 145 and must be discharged by the

husband as administrator of the community. In fact Dr. Coorey alluded to James Cecil

Walter Pereira on the Laws of Ceylon ~ 2nd Edition (1913) wherein the learned author

points out that the wife becomes chargeable not only with the debts of the husband,

but even with the liabilities which he has incurred. Walter Pereira points out that

liability of the wife for the debts contracted by the husband stante matrominio exists

independently of either species of community, and is a consequence of marital power~

see page 244 of the 2nd Edition of Walter Pereira on the Laws of Ceylon.

It has been held in South Africa that contractual debts incurred by the husband as the

administrator of the common estate are binding on both spouses and must be

discharged out of the common estate~see Thom v. Worthman No.l962( 4) S.A 83N.

Prior to 1876, the proprietary rights of the spouses were governed by the Roman

Dutch common law. Consequently, in the absence of an antenuptial contract

excluding community of property and of profit and loss, all their assets and liabilities

of the spouses at the time of marriage were merged in a common estate or fund.

Therefore, irrespective of the nature of the property and the manner in which it was

acquired, all property belonging to the spouses at the time of marriage, together with

all property acquired stante matrimonio formed the common estate~See Grotius 2.11.8:

3.21.10: Voet 24.2.65. This universal partnership of the spouses took place by

operation of law immediately on the solemnization of the marriage, and continued

5

until such time as the marriage was terminated by death or divorce, or on the

annulment of the voidable marriage, or when an order of boedelscheiding (partition of

the estate) was made -see H.D. Hahlo - the South African law of husband and wife

Chap 14.

There is authority in Sri Lanka to the effect that the whole community was liable to

be sold in satisfaction of a contractual debt incurred by the husband when he had

misappropriated funds entrusted to him in the course of his employment-see

Seiesteen OdearSantiagopuUe v.John Wj}jjam De Neise(l886-1889) 8 S.C.C 27.

Burnside C.J and Clarence J. held in this case that the obligation incurred by the

husband by his misappropriation of moneys belonging to the government was an

obligation arising ex contractu, notwithstanding that the husband might have been

criminally prosecuted for embezzlement; and that, consequently, the wife's share of

the common estate was liable to be sold in satisfaction of such obligation. It has to be

pointed out that Dias J. held a dissentient view to the effect that the debt was

incurred by the husband by reason of a delictum amounting to a crime.

The Sri Lankan courts have taken the view that the joint estate was not liable for the

delictual debts of one spouse. It was in those circumstances that Dias J. excluded the

wife's half of the property from liability though the majority enforced the liability of

the wife's property as they were of the view that the husband's debt to the

government was contractual.

En passant it is worthy of note that the Matrimonial Rights and Inheritance Ordinance

No.l5 of 1876 introduced the concept of separate property in place of the Roman

Dutch concept of community of property and Section 8 abolished community of

goods between husband and wife in respect of marriages contracted after the

proclamation of the Ordinance. Section 5 of the Ordinance clearly provided that the

Ordinance was not to affect rights acquired under marriages solemnized before the

proclamation of the Ordinance and thus such marriages were governed by the law

which applied at the time these marriages were contracted. A discussion of the

6

I

ti i ! Ii i ;

~~~~~-~----

developments post the Matrimonial Rights and Inheritance Ordinance No.l5 of 1876

and the Married Women's Property Ordinance No.l8 of 1923 is not germane to the

issue before this Court as the concept of community of property applies strict sensu to

the facts of this case and it is quite clear that Maria~the daughter of Catherina did not

inherit l/12th share of her mother as it had been seized and sold in satisfaction of her

father's debt pursuant to the concept of community of property. Catherina could not

therefore have passed any dominium of the share to Maria and so 6th Defendant could

not have become the owner thereof.

The allotment of the aforesaid 1/12th share to the 6th Defendant is thus erroneous and I

proceed to set aside this allotment and in lieu thereof this Court orders that the

Plaintiff be allotted the 1I1ih share of Catherina. In the circumstances the learned

District Judge of Kalutara is directed to vary the summary of allotment at page 321 of

the appeal brief.

Apart from the above Dr. Coorey made two other complaints about the judgment

dated 03.08.2000 in this partition action. The first revolves around the finding of the

learned District Judge that one of the parties namely the 1st Defendant should be able

to draw water from the well depicted as "0" in the preliminary plan X. The

contention was that the purpose and effect of a partition is to put an end to the

inconvenience of co~ownership. This effect would be nullified when one finds that the

location of the well is almost within the house of the Plaintiff and thus a grant of

servitutal right to the 1st Defendant to draw water from this well is impractical and

causes inconvenience to the Plaintiff. It is apparent from the perusal of the

proceedings that the public water supply that is available along Colombo~Galle Road,

at Maggona where the land is situated has catered to the needs of the 1st Defendant

who had amply used this water supply.

Mr. Chandana Prematilaka who appeared for the substituted lA Defendant quite

correctly submitted that the Defendant was prepared to give up the servitutal right

awarded in the judgment. Accordingly the answer to issue No.l8 must be varied and

7

I 1 I I t I

j

~

,

the well is declared to be for the exclusive use of the Plaintiff. So the learned District

Judge is directed to allot the well only to the Plaintiff.

The other complaint that was urged before this Court is that the learned District

Judge erred in allotting improvements marked as I and J in Lot 3 (referred to as Lot 1

in the judgment) to the 4th Defendant as admittedly the 4th Defendant does not enjoy

soil rights and this allotment to the said Defendant is all the more erroneous having

regard to the fact that an admission was recorded at the trial that improvements and

plantations should be allotted as claimed before the surveyor-see the admission at

page 228 of the brief. At item 3 of his report (Xl) at page 123, the surveyor has

reported that the improvements I and J which are contiguous were claimed by the

Plaintiff and the 4th Defendant never put forward a claim in respect of them. As

nobody had counterclaimed before the surveyor, the learned District Judge should

have given I and J to the Plaintiff as he was the only one to have staked a claim to the

constructions before the surveyor. I therefore set aside the allotment of I and J to the

4th Defendant and order the District Judge to allot them to the Plaintiff.

Subject to the above variations namely the allotments of the 1I12th share of Catherina,

the well and I and J to the Plaintiff, which I allow in favor of the Plaintiff, I proceed to

affirm the judgment of the District Judge dated 03.08.2000. The learned District Judge

is directed to enter judgment and decree accordingly subject to the aforesaid

variations.

The appeal is allowed to the extent of the aforesaid variations.
