JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1 (PICA)'

The person who had stood as the accused in the Magistrate's Court was

Denawatte Gedera Janaranjana who is the 1st Respondent - Respondent in

this application. He had been charged under the provisions of the Forest

Ordinance in the Magistrate's Court. He then had pleaded guilty to the

charges. The learned Magistrate had then convicted and sentenced him.

Learned Magistrate had thereafter taken steps to hold an inquiry to decide

the question whether the vehicle (which is an earth excavator machine

commonly referred to as a backhoe bearing registration No. EPZA 2942)

should be confiscated or not.

Journal entry dated 2014-11-11 clearly shows that both the absolute owner

as well as the registered owner had been aware of this inquiry. The absolute

owner had made an application that the above vehicle be released to him.

5

However the registered owner (the Petitioner in the instant application) had

categorically stated before the learned Magistrate that he does not claim the

vehicle. This had compelled the learned Magistrate to hear only the absolute

;

) owner to ascertain whether he should release the vehicle to the absolute

owner.

At the end of the said inquiry learned Magistrate by his order dated 2015-

05-07 had concluded (for the reasons set out in that order) that the absolute

owner has failed to satisfy him that he had taken all possible steps to prevent

this vehicle being used for illegal activities. It was on that basis that the

learned Magistrate had confiscated the said vehicle. It is to be noted that

the absolute owner of this vehicle is the 3rd Respondent (Peoples' Leasing

Company).

I The application for revision filed in the Provincial High Court by the Petitioner

clearly shows that he is the registered owner of this vehicle. His request in

that application is to set aside the order of the learned Magistrate dated

2015-05-07 on the basis that the learned Magistrate did not afford him an

opportunity to be heard.

6

At the outset this Court also has to observe that this position is quite contrary

to the position he had taken before the Magistrate's Court. Further as has

been pOinted out by the learned Provincial High Court Judge in his judgement

dated 2016-01-11, the Petitioner appears to have suppressed this position

in the Petition he had filed before the Provincial High Court.

j It is the view of this Court that the learned Provincial High Court Judge is

correct when he decided to refuse and dismiss the application for revision

filed by the Petitioner. One has to bear in mind that the revisionary

jurisdiction of Court is a discretionary one.' An application for revision is a

request by the applicant urging the Court to exercise its discretionary

powers. Therefore, such applicant must take care to place the correct factual

position before the revisionary Court.

This Court observes that there had been no basis for the Provincial High

'I

Court to interfere with the conclusion,of the learned Magistrate as there

are adequate reasons to satisfy itselfwith its legality and propriety.

In these Circumstances, this Court has no basis to interfere with the order

of the learned Provincial High Court Judge. Thus, this Court decides to

affirm the judgment dated 2016-01-11 of the learned Provincial High Court

7

Judge as well as the order dated 2015-05-07 ,of the learned Magistrate and

dismiss this appeal.

We make no order for costs.
