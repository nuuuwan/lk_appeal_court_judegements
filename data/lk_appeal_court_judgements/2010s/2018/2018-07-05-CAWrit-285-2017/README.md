Janak De Silva J.

The Petitioner was elected as a member of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) on 25.09.2013

from the Mannar District on the Iliankai Tamil Arasu Kadchi (ITAK) list (P1). He was appointed as

Minister of Fisheries, Transport, Trade and Commerce and Rural Development of the NPC with

effect from 1l.10.2013(P2). Four other Ministers, namely, the pt Respondent who is also the

Chief Minister ofthe NPC, 6th Respondent, Hon. P. Ayngaranesan and Hon. T. Kurukularasa were

sworn in as Ministers alongside the Petitioner. Later, the Petitioner was aSSigned a further

portfolio of Road Development and Motor Traffic (P3).

Sometime in 2016, the 1st Respondent appointed an inquiry panel to inquire into allegations

already made and allegations that would be made in the future in respect of Hon. P.

Ayngaranesan, Hon. T. Kurukularasa, the 6th Respondent and the Petitioner. The inquiry panel

exonerated the Petitioner and the 6th Respondent but held that Hon. P. Ayngaranesan and Hon.

T. Kurukularasa were guilty of certain allegations and recommended that they be removed as

Ministers.

On 06.06.2017 the pt Respondent presented the inquiry panel report before the NPC and

informed that explanations will be called from the Ministers found guilty. On 14.06.2017 the 1st

Respondent requested the two Ministers found guilty to resign and at the same time indicated

that the two Ministers found not guilty, i.e. Petitioner and 6th Respondent, must go on one

month's compulsory leave pending fresh inquiry into them. The Petitioner claims that several

members of the ITAK protested at the unfair treatment of the Petitioner and 6th Respondent

which culminated in the handing over of a motion of no-confidence against the 1st Respondent

signed by about 20 members of the NPC.

The Petitioner claims that later after several discussions between the 1st Respondent and the

leader of the ITAK Hon. R. Sampanthan, it was agreed that the motion of no-confidence against

the 1st Respondent would be withdrawn if inter alia the Petitioner and 6th Respondent would not

be compelled to go on compulsory leave pending another inquiry which the pt Respondent may

wish to conduct.

r

The Petitioner submits he became aware in the meantime that Ministers Hon. P. Ayngaranesan

and Hon. T. Kurukularasa had resigned and were replaced by the 2nd and 3rd Respondents (P6).

The Petitioner claims that despite the understanding between Hon. R. Sampanthan and the pt

Respondent, attempts were made by the pt Respondent to remove the Petitioner and the 6th

Respondent from the Board of Ministers of the NPC. He states that several attempts were made

by the pt Respondent through intermediaries to get the Petitioner to resign voluntarily which he

resisted. The Petitioner states that there were some media reports that the 6th Respondent has

indicated his desire to resign voluntarily but he is unaware whether the 6th Respondent has in

fact resigned.

On 22.08.2017 the Petitioner attended the meeting of the Board of Minister's held at the

residence of the pt Respondent. On 23.08.2017 the 7th Respondent, Governor of the NPC,

informed the Petitioner during a telephone conversation that the 1st Respondent had removed

the Petitioner from office and that the 7th Respondent had received a letter to that effect and

that the 1st Respondent wanted the 7th Respondent to swear in new Ministers to replace the

Petitioner and the 6th Respondent. The Petitioner informed the 7th Respondent that the pt

Respondent had no authority to remove the Petitioner.

By letter dated 23.08.2017 (P8) sent to the 7th Respondent which was copied to the pt

Respondent, the Petitioner states that he is made to understand from the news paper that the

pt Respondent has requested the 7th Respondent to swear in new Ministers including one to

replace him. In that letter the Petitioner states that he continues to be a Minister of the NPC and

that a Governor of a Province has no authority to cause a "Minister to lose his position acting on

the advice of the Chief Minister" and called upon the 7th Respondent to "halt your hands" in the

swearing in of a new Minister replacing the Petitioner.

The Petitioner however later learnt from media reports that the 7th Respondent had purported

to swear in the 3rd and 4th Respondents as Ministers as requested by the pt Respondent.

Thereafter the Petitioner sent the 7th Respondent letter dated 24.08.2017 (P11) by which he

asserted that there was no vacancy in the Board of Ministers of the NPC to which a person could

Page 4 of22

have been appointed to replace the Petitioner and that he continues to remain as a member of

the Board of Ministers of the NPC.

The Petitioner further states that on 24.0B.2017(P12} he collected a letter dated 20.0B.2017

addressed to him by the 1st Respondent which read:

"this is to inform you that I have decided to remove you from the post of Minister of

Fisheries, Transport, Trade and Commerce, Rural Development, Road Development and

Motor Traffic forthwith. Please hand over all official documents in this regard to your

Secretary. The official letter in this regard will follow. Thank you." (emphasis added)

Subsequently, the Petitioner states that he became aware that the portfolios held by him have

been purportedly distributed amongst the Pt, 3rd and 5th Respondents (P13).

The Petitioner received a letter dated 25.0B.2017 (P14) from the 1st Respondent in response to

PB which reads as follows:

"Your letter of 24.0B.2017 under above handing to hand.

I refer you to Article 154(F}(5} of the Constitution and section 14(f} of the Interpretation

Ordinance. In any event there is no Ministry as you refer."

The Petitioner states that his purported removal by the pt Respondent as evidenced by P12 is

ultra vires the powers of the 1st Respondent and is illegal, void ab initio and of no force or effect

in law. He further states that in terms of Article 154F (5) of the Constitution the power of

appointment of Ministers is provided to the Governor who shall appoint such Minister on the

advice of the Chief Minister but is silent on the question of removal of Ministers.

It is further submitted that in terms of Article 154F (1) of the Constitution, the Board of Ministers

is restricted to the Chief Minister and not more than four other Ministers. The Petitioner claims

that the purported appointment of the 4th and 5th Respondents as Ministers was made despite

the absence of any vacancies in the Board of Ministers of the NPC.

Previous Proceedings

On 19.09.2017 this application was supported for notice before another division of this Court and

the learned Counsel for the Petitioner and 6th Respondent and the Learned President's Counsel

for the 1st Respondent were heard. The Court on 16.10.2017 refused notice on the basis that the

affidavit filed by the Petitioner is not valid, P12 is not amendable to writ jurisdiction as it is only

a communication of the intention of the pt Respondent to remove the Petitioner and that the

impugned appointments are political in nature and the rules of administrative law does not apply

to them.

The Petitioner filed S.c. (Special) Leave to Appeal Application No. 246/2017 assailing the

judgement of the Court of Appeal. On 21.11.2017 the Supreme Court made order that the parties

are agreeable to have the matter sent back to the Court of Appeal and to have the matter

supported afresh after notice to the Respondents.

When this matter was sought to be supported for notice after all parties were noticed, the

learned President's Counsel forthe 1st Respondent raised what he termed to be three preliminary

objections in law for consideration by Court which are:

(1) This Court is without jurisdiction to hear and determine this application by reason of

the provisions of Article 125 of the Constitution, in that, the Application calls for an

interpretation of the provisions of Article 154F (5) of the Constitution.

(2) This application is violative of Rule 3(1)(a) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate

Procedure) Rules 1990, in that, the Petitioner has failed to exhibit either the original

or duly certified copies of its exhibits together with the Petition.

(3) As a matter of law, the 6th Respondent could not have been impleaded as a party

Respondent to this Application and his name should therefore be struck off for the

reason that it is settled law that in proceedings for prerogative writs the only persons

who can be made party Respondents are (i) the person or authority whose exercise

of power is sought to be prohibited and/or quashed, and (ii) persons who benefitted

from the impugned order.

Delay in raising preliminary objections

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner objected to these preliminary objections been considered

by Court as the 1st Respondent did not raise it when this matter was first supported on 19.09.2017

or before the Supreme Court when the special leave to appeal matter was taken up. He relied on

the decision in Ediriwickrama and another v. Ratnasiri [S.c. Appeal No. 85/2004, S.C.M. of

22.02.2013]. There the Supreme Court overruled certain preliminary objections inter alia as they

were taken up nearly nine years after special leave to appeal was granted. However, in this

application the Court of Appeal after hearing parties refused notice on 19.09.2017 against which

a special leave to appeal application was filed. When that matter was supported parties agreed

to have the matter sent back to the Court of Appeal and to have the matter supported afresh

after notice to the Respondents. Hence the facts in this application are different to the facts in

Ediriwickrama's case (supra).

In any event, the first preliminary objection is based on Article 125 of the Constitution which

vests the Supreme Court with sole and exclusive jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution. Hence

there is a patent lack of jurisdiction for this Court to interpret the Constitution which cannot be

remedied by the acquiescence of the parties [Thambipillai and two others v. Thambumuttu (77

N.L.R.97)].

I therefore overrule the objection raised by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner to the

preliminary objections raised on behalf of the pt Respondent.

Preliminary Objection No. 1 - Petitioner's application calls for an interpretation of the

provisions of Article 154F {5} o/the Constitution

Ambit and Scope of Article 125 of the Constitution

Article 125 of the Constitution states that the Supreme Court has sole and exclusive jurisdiction

to hear and determine any question relating to the interpretation of the Constitution and

whenever any such question arises in the course of any proceedings in, inter alia this Court, such

question must be referred to the Supreme Court for determination.

Page 7 of 22

The ambit and scope of Article 125 of the Constitution was explained by Samarakoon c.J. in

Billimoria v. Minister of Lands and Land Development & Mahaweli Development and others

[(1978-79-80) 1 Sri. L. R. 10 at 15] as follows:

"What is contemplated in Article 125 is "any question relating to the interpretation of the

Constitution" arising in the course of legal proceedings. This presupposes that in the

determination of a real issue or controversy between the parties, in any adversary

proceedings between them, there must arise the need for an interpretation of the

provisions of the Constitution. The mere reliance on a constitutional provision by a party

need not necessarily involve the question of the interpretation of the Constitution. There

must be a dispute on interpretation between contending parties. It would appear that

Article 125 is so circumscribed that it must be construed as dealing only with cases where

the interpretation of the Constitution is drawn into the actual dispute and such question

is raised directly as an issue between the parties or impinges on an issue and forms part

of the case of one party, opposed by the other, and which the Court must of necessity

decide in resolving that issue."

This exposition of the law was long considered to be the correct legal position and followed by

our Courts. In Shanthi Chandrasekeram v D.B Wijetunge and others [(1992) 2 Sri LR 293 at 297]

Fernando J. appears to have adopted part of the said observations in stating that "just as Article

125(1) would apply to a question relating to the interpretation of the Constitution, properly

arising in the course of the proceedings of any court or tribunal, and not one which is irrelevant

or of purely academic interest."

However, the learned President's Counsel for the 1st Respondent submitted that the ratio

decidendi in Billimoria's case is:

"Article 125 of the Constitution requires any dispute on the interpretation of the

Constitution to be referred to this Court. What is contemplated in Article 125 is "any

question relating to the interpretation of the Constitution" arising in the course of legal

proceedings."

Page 8 of 22

..

He submitted that the rest of the judicial pronouncement in Billimoria's case is obiter dicta and

relied on the determination of the Supreme Court in Chandra Jayaratne v. Hon. Anura

Priyadarshana Yapa and others [S.c. Reference No. 3/2012, CA. (Writ) Application No.

358/2012].

The learned Counsel for the Petitioner in response submitted that in Hon. Attorney General v. Dr.

Upathissa Atapattu Bandaranayke Was ala Mudiyanse Ralahamilage Shirani Anshumala

Bandaranayake and others [S.c. Appeal 67/2013, S.C.M. 21.02.2014] a five-judge bench of the

Supreme Court overruled the determination of the Supreme Court in Chandra Jayaratne's case

(supra) and as such Billimoria's case should be considered as the authoritative guide in

understanding the ambit and scope of Article 125 of the Constitution.

Marsoof J. in the relevant part of the Dr. Bandaranayake's case (supra) held as follows:

lilt is my considered opinion that the determination of this Court in SC Reference No.

3/2012 manifestly exceeded the mandate conferred on this Court by Article 125(1) of the

Constitution to interpret the Constitution, and was made in disregard of the clear

language of Article 107(3) and other basic provisions of the Constitution. The

determination is a blatant distortion of the law, and is altogether erroneous, and must

not be allowed to stand. This Court hereby overrules the said determination of this Court

in SC Reference No. 3/2012." [page 24 of the judgement]

The learned President's Counsel for the 1st Respondent countered by submitting that the five-

judge bench in Dr. Bandaranayake's case (supra) could not as a matter of law have overruled the

determination of the three-judge bench in Chandra Jayaratne's case (supra) vis-a-vis its

pronouncements about the ambit and scope of Article 125 of the Constitution.

In addressing this submission, it is important to bear in mind the distinction between the ratio

decidendi and the obiter dicta of a judgement.

Page 9 of 22

Rupert Cross in Precedents in the English Law (3rd Ed., 1977) offers the following formulations for

the two terms:

"The ratio decidendi of a case is any rule of law expressly or impliedly treated by the judge

as a necessary step in reaching his conclusion, having regard to the line of reasoning

adopted by him, or a necessary part of his direction to the jury" (page 76)

"Obiter dictum is a proposition of law which does not form part of the ratio decidendi"

(page 79)

Thamotheram J. in Walker Sons and Co. (UK) Ltd. v. Gunatilake [(1978-79-80) 1 Sri. L. R. 231 at

232] explicitly held that the ratio decidendi of a Superior Court is binding for all inferior Courts:

"The ratio decidendi of cases decided by the Court becomes a rule for the future binding

all courts which the courts of last resort are not whether it be under the same system or

under a different system."

Rupert Cross in Precedents in the English Law (Oxford University Press, 1961 at p. 75) states that

in order to discover what the ratio decidendi of a particular case is one must have regard to the

facts of that case, the issues raised by the pleadings and arguments and subsequent cases that

have considered the case under review.

As correctly submitted by the learned President's Counsel for the 1st Respondent, the two

questions upon which leave had been granted in Dr. Bandaranayake's case (supra) were:

1) Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that the writ jurisdiction of that Court embodied

in Article 140 of the Constitution extends to proceedings of Parliament or a

Committee of Parliament?

2) Did the Court of Appeal err in holding that the words "any Court of first instance or

tribunal or other institution or any other person" in Article 140 of the Constitution

extends to the Parliament or a Committee of Parliament?

Page 10 of 22

..

Rupert Cross in Precedents in the English Law (Oxford University Press, 1961 at p. 122) observes

that express overruling in general is where a later decision overrules the ratio decidendi of a

previous case. This results in the ratio decidendi of the earlier case having no authority so far as

the doctrine of binding precedent is concerned. He goes onto say that dicta in an overruled

judgment could still be cited in the course of argument in subsequent cases since the case

only ceases to be authority for the ratio decidendi.

Hence, I agree with the submission made by the learned President's Counsel for the 1st

Respondent that the five-judge bench in Dr. Bandaranayake's case (supra) could not, as a

matter of law, have overruled the determination of the three-judge bench in Chandra

Jayaratne's case (supra) vis-a-vis its pronouncement on the ambit and scope of Article 125 of

the Constitution and that the part of the judgement in Chandra Jayaratne's case (supra) dealing

with the ambit and scope of Article 125 of the Constitution could still be cited in the course of

argument in subsequent cases since the case only ceases to be authority for the ratio decidendi.

In Chandra Jayaratne's case (supra) after analysing Article 125 of the Constitution the Supreme

Court appears to take the view that the observations made in Billimoria's case (supra) on the

scope of Article 125 of the Constitution is obiter dicta although later it is stated that "in any

event Samarakone c.J.'s pronouncement (sic) Billimoria's case on Article 125 is to be treated

with high respect" (page 12).

The Supreme Court went on to state:

"This shows that even in the absence of a dispute between contending parties as to the

correct interpretation of a constitutional provision, a question for the interpretation of

the Constitution can be referred to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court having regard

to the facts giving rise to the dispute and the pleadings, if any, filed in the court, tribunal

or other institution making the reference and the terms of the question referred to it,

may decide whether such question shall be entertained and answered.

Page 11 of 22

There may also be a situation where a court ex mero motu may decide to make a

reference for the interpretation of the Constitution in a situation where both or all parties

concede that a particular view is the correct interpretation of a constitutional provision.

The interpretation of the constitution being a question of law, a court is not bound by the

concessions of parties on a question of law. In such a situation there is nothing in Article

125 to prevent a court from making a reference under Article 125 ex mero motu." (page

10 of the determination)

However, the question referred to the Supreme Court in Chandra Jayaratne's case (supra) was:

"ls it mandatory under Article 107(3) of the Constitution for the Parliament to provide for

matter (sic) relating to the forum before which the allegations are to be proved, the mode

of proof, burden of proof, standard of proof etc., of any alleged misbehavour (sic) or

incapacity in addition to maters relating to the investigation of the alleged misbehavour

(sic) or incapacity?"

The reference did not deal with the ambit and scope of Article 125 of the Constitution.

Accordingly, applying the same test proposed by the learned President's Counsel to ascertain the

ratio decidendi in Dr. 8andaranayake's case (supra), I am of the view that the dicta in Chandra

Jayaratne's case (supra) on the ambit and scope of Article 125 of the Constitution is not part of

the ratio decidendi of the case.

Rupert Cross in Precedents in the English Law (3rd Ed., 1977) observes that a distinction can be

drawn between different kinds of dicta. This would be:

(a) dicta which are irrelevant to the case in which they occur (which he identifies as obiter dicta)

and

(b) dicta which relate to some collateral issue in the case although not forming part of the ratio

decidendi (which he identifies as judicial dicta). (page 85) (emphasis added)

Page 12 of 22

."

.-

This classification seems to suggest that judicial dicta have a higher level of authority than mere

obiter dicta. In my view the observations made in Chandra Jayaratne's case (supra) about the

scope of Article 125 falls into the latter category as the Supreme Court had to deal with the ambit

and scope of Article 125 of the Constitution in response to a preliminary objection raised by the

Attorney General in both his oral arguments and written submissions.

Nonetheless I note that, which the Supreme Court did not consider in Chandra Jayaratne's case

(supra), the dicta in Billimoria's case (supra) on the ambit and scope of Article 125 of the

Constitution received a high approval of seven (7) judges of the Supreme Court in Wijewickrema

v. Attorney General [(1982) 2 Sri. L. R. 775 at 777] when the Supreme Court stated that "Before

parting with this matter, we wish to draw the attention of the District Judge to the requirements

of Rule 64 of the Supreme Court Rules 1978 and to the observations of this Court in Billimoria's

case whenever a reference is made under Article 125(1)" (emphasis added). That matter arose

from a reference made by the District Court in terms of Article 125 of the Constitution Thus, a

seven-judge division of the present Supreme Court had no hesitation in acknowledging what they

referred to as "the observations of this Court in Billimoria's case" as the correct statement of the

law on the ambit and scope of Article 125 of the Constitution.

In the circumstances, I am inclined to apply the judicial dicta in Billimoria's case (supra) vis-a-vis

Article 125 of the Constitution in determining whether this application raises a question of

interpretation of the Constitution as presently constituted.

Interpretation v. Application

In examining this question, it is important to bear in mind the distinction between interpretation

and application as Article 125 of the Constitution requires only a question relating to the

interpretation of the Constitution to be referred to the Supreme Court.

Page 13 of 22

oC

In Kumaranatunge v. Jayakody and another [{1984} 2 Sri LR 45 at 58] Tambiah J. explains the

distinction between the two concepts as follows:

"There is a clear distinction between "application" and "interpretation" of a provision of a

Statute. "Interpretation may be defined as the process of reducing the Statute

applicable to a single sensible meaning - the making of a choice from several possible

meanings. Application, on the other hand, is the process of determining whether the

facts of the case come within the meaning so chosen . .... The meaning of a statute is

not doubtful merely because its application in a particular case is doubtful. Even though

the statute is so plain and explicit as to be susceptible of only one sensible meaning, and

even though the meaning is ascertained as a matter of interpretation, it often remains in

doubt whether the facts are within or without the penumbra of a single meaning. To

determine this question, then, is what is meant by application." {emphasis added}

Analogous approach is discernible when a similar question arises in the context of treaty

interpretation.

The simplest exposition of the distinction between treaty interpretation and treaty application

can be seen in the Dissenting Opinion of Judge Ehrlich in the Case concerning the Factory at

Chorzow (Claim for indemnity-Jurisdiction) [PCIJ Rep Series A No 9 {1927}]. The learned judge

observed as follows:

liThe words "interpretation and application" do not, by themselves, imply such an

affirmative answer. They refer to processes, of which one, interpretation, is that of

determining the meaning of a rule, while the other, application, is, in one sense, that of

determining the consequences which the rule attaches to the occurrence of a given fact;

in another sense, application is the action of bringing about the consequences which,

according to a rule, should follow a fact. Disputes concerning interpretation or application

are, therefore, disputes as to the meaning of a rule or as to whether the consequences

which the rule attaches to a fact, should follow in a given case."

Page 14 of 22

-'

A similar viewpoint is taken in the Harvard Law School Draft Convention on the Law of Treaties

Commentary [Harvard Law School, 'Draft Convention on the Law of Treaties: Article 19.

Interpretation' reprinted in (1935) 29 AJIL (Supplement: Research in International Law) 937,

938-39] according to which 'interpretation is the process of determining the meaning of a text;

application is the process of determining the consequences which, according to the text, should

follow in a given situation'.

I invited the learned President's Counsel for the pt Respondent to propose the question relating

to the interpretation of the Constitution which according to him arises for determination in these

proceedings. He has proposed the following question:

"Whether, a Chief Minister of a Provincial Council has the power to remove a Minister

appointed under and in terms of the provisions of Article 154F (5) of the Constitution or

whether such power is reposed in the Governor to be exercised in his own discretion?"

However, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner submitted that no question of interpretation

of the Constitution arises in this application. He submits that it is only a question of application

that requires the attention of Court. He bases his argument on a plain reading of Article 154F

(5) of the Constitution and submits that it is clearly stated that it is the Governor who has the

power to appoint Ministers of a Provincial Council. He further submits that while the Article

does provide for the Governor to act on the advice of the Chief Minister, even if the role played

by the Governor was held to be that of a mere rubber stamp, the fact remains that it is the

Governor who is the appointing (and thus removing) authority for Ministers of a Provincial

Council. Hence it was submitted that even if one applies section 14 of the Interpretation

Ordinance as asserted by the 1st Respondent, a removal of a Minister cannot be effectuated

unless and until there is an act of the Governor doing so.

The Sinhala text of Article 154F (5) reads as follows:

"154" (5) qo~lt:i>oO'E)O'",o eSm 90025:> <f@Oti:>)Se:lO'",oG'aJ COG'<aa", <f~e:l, G'Q9

@zrl~e:lO''''zrl <f?5cl5zrl o%5:f t:i>@ A%5:fG'%5:f",." (emphasis added)

Page 15 of 22

I am inclined to agree with the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that it is clear on a plain

reading of Article 154F (5) that the final act of appointment as well as removal (if one accepts

the argument of the learned President's Counsel for the 1st Respondent based on section 14 of

the Interpretation Ordinance) of a Minister of a Provincial Council must be under the hand of

the Governor. The position is the same even if it is held that the Governor has no discretion in

that act and must act on the advice of the Chief Minister. Therefore, the question proposed by

the learned President's Counsel for the pt Respondent does not arise for determination on the

pleadings presently constituted in this application.

The real question is whether the facts of this case discloses that the removal of the Petitioner

has been carried out under the hand of the Governor. This is a question of application and not

interpretation.

The facts of this application as presently pleaded are as follows:

(a) The Petitioner was appointed as a Minister of the NPC along with four others.

(b) The 1st Respondent wrote to the Petitioner informing him that the pt Respondent

has decided to remove the Petitioner from the post of Minister of Fisheries,

Transport, Trade and Commerce, Rural Development, Road Development and Motor

Traffic forthwith and that the official letter in this regard will follow.

(c) On 23.08.2017 the 7th Respondent, Governor of the NPC, informed the Petitioner

during a telephone conversation that the 1st Respondent had removed the Petitioner

from office and that the 7th Respondent had received a letter to that effect and that

the pt Respondent wanted the 7th Respondent to swear in new Ministers to replace

the Petitioner and the 6th Respondent.

(d) On been challenged as to the authority of the pt Respondent to remove the

Petitioner, the 1st Respondent claimed he had the power to remove the Petitioner

in terms of Article 154F (5) of the Constitution and section 14(f) of the Interpretation

Ordinance

(e) The Governor appointed two new Ministers.

Page 16 of 22

,

t

The facts presently before us does not indicate of any act by which the Governor removed the

Petitioner from the post of Minister. In fact, the 7th Respondent Governor has failed to appear

before Court and state his case though noticed by Court. The only document before Court which

speaks of the Petitioners removal is P12 by which the pt Respondent states that he has decided

to remove the Petitioner from the post of Minister. There is also the telephone conversation

between the Petitioner and 7th Respondent as pleaded by the Petitioner.

The pt Respondent could have countered this evidence by seeking permission and filing limited

statement of objections to the interim relief. However, he did not do so.

In Billimoria's case Samarakone C. J. held that liThe mere reliance on a constitutional provision

by a party need not necessarily involve the question of the interpretation of the Constitution.

There must be a dispute on interpretation between contending parties. It would appear that

Article 125 is so circumscribed that it must be construed as dealing only with cases where the

interpretation of the Constitution is drawn into the actual dispute and such question is raised

directly as an issue between the parties or impinges on an issue and forms part of the case of

one party, opposed by the other, and which the Court must of necessity decide in resolving that

issue."

In the circumstances, I am inclined to take the view that as presently constituted this application

does not raise a question of interpretation but merely an application of the Constitution. This

may well change once parties, including the 7th Respondent if he so wishes to, files objections

and places factual matters for our consideration at which point we may have to revisit the

question of a reference to the Supreme Court in terms of Article 125 of the Constitution.

In this regard I wish to refer to the judgement in Premachandra v. Major Montague

Jayawickrema and another (Provincial Governor's case) [(1994) 2 SrLL.R. 90 at 100] where the

Supreme Court stated as follows:

liThe function of this Court under Article 125 is not to attempt to provide comprehensive

answers (to abstract or academic questions) setting out all the available grounds of

judicial review, but rather to provide answers for the questions which actually arose in

the course of the proceedings in the Court of Appeal. It would have been far more

satisfactory if, after hearing parties, the questions had been framed with specific

Page 17 of 22

.

reference to the grounds of challenge relevant to, and arising from the facts of, the

pending applications." (emphasis added)

I therefore overrule the 1st preliminary objection raised by the learned President's Counsel for

the 1st Respondent.

Preliminary Objection No. 2 - Non-compliance with Rule 3(1}(a} of the Court of Appeal

(Appellate Procedure] Rules 1990

The learned President's Counsel for the pt Respondent submitted that the Petitioner has failed

to comply with the above rule and as such the application must be dismissed in limine. He relies

on the decisions in Thajudeen v. Sri Lanka Tea Board and another [(1981) 2 SrLloR. 471], Brown

& Co. Ltd. and Another v. Ratnayake, Arbitrator and Others [(1994) 3 SrLloR. 91] and Perera v.

Perera [(2001) 3 SrLloR. 30].

Rule 3(1) of the Court of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990 (1990 Rules) reads:

If Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of powers vested in the

Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the Constitution shall be by way of Petition,

together with an affidavit in support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied

by the originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies

thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a Petitioner is unable to tender any such

document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the leave of Court to

furnish such document later. Where a Petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this

rule the Court may, ex mero motu or at the instance of any party, dismiss such application.

The Petitioner has annexed fourteen annexures to the petition. P12 and P14 are two letters sent

by the pt Respondent to the Petitioner and the originals of these have been annexed and there

is compliance with the Rule 3(1) of the 1990 Rules with regard to these two documents.

P7, P8, PI0 and P11 are letters sent by the Petitioner to either the 1st Respondent or the 7th

Respondent with copy to the 1st Respondent. Clearly the originals of these documents are not

available with him. The Petitioner has, at paragraph 62 of the petition, stated that originals of

Page 18 of 22

several documents relevant to this matter are in the custody of the pt and 7th Respondents and

has reserved the right to make an appropriate application to Court to call for the record and/or

permit him to obtain and produce the required documents. In my view, this complies with the

requirements in Rule 3(1) of the 1990 Rules.

P1, P2, P3, P6 and Pl3 are Gazettes of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The

Petitioner states that these were obtained from the website of the Government of Sri Lanka

documents.gov.lk. The learned President's Counsel for the 1st Respondent submits that this does

not comply with Rule 3(1) of the 1990 Rules. I am unable to accept this submission.

Section 57(7) of the Evidence Ordinance states that Courts shall take judicial notice of the

accession to office, names, titles, functions, and signatures of the persons filling for the time

being any public office in any part of Sri Lanka, if the fact of their appointment to such office is

notified in the Gazette. The gazettes marked P1, P2, P3, P6 and Pl3 refers to the appointment of

members and ministers of the NPC. In Arumugam alias Podithambi v. Range Forest Officer [(1986)

2 Sri. L. R. 398] the Court of Appeal held that when a charge is laid under a statutory rule,

regulation or by-law which is required by law to be published in the Government Gazette the

prosecution need not produce the gazette in which the rule or regulation or by-law appears in

proof thereof and that reference to the particular gazette is sufficient. It was further held that

Court can take judicial notice of the rule, regulation or by-law. Therefore, I agree with the

submissions made by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner that Court will take judicial notice

thereof and it would have been sufficient for the Petitioner to only name the gazettes without

annexing same.

In any event, section 3 of the Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006 (Act) states inter alia

that no electronic document shall be denied legal recognition, effect, validity or enforceability on

the ground that it is in electronic form. Section 26 of the Act states that "electronic document"

includes documents, records, information, communications or transactions in electronic form.

Section 9 of the Act states that where any Act or enactment provides that any Proclamation, rule,

regulation, order, by-law, notification, or other matter shall be published in the Gazette, then

Page 19 of 22

r

..

such requirement shall be deemed to have been satisfied if such rule, regulation, order, by-law,

notification or other matter is published in an electronic form of the Gazette.

Therefore, even though a Court will take judicial notice thereof and it would have been sufficient

for the Petitioner to only name the gazette without annexing same, I am of the view that there

is also compliance with Rule 3(1) of the 1990 Rules even where a copy of the Government Gazette

is produced from the website of the Government of Sri Lanka documents.gov.lk.

I am of the view that in any event the Petitioner has complied with Rule 3(1) (a) of the 1990 Rules.

The requirement is that originals or duly certified copies of the documents material to this

application must be tendered. [Urban Development Authority v. Ceylon Entertainments Ltd.

(2004) 1 Sri. L. R. 95, 97 and 98]. Whether a document is material or not is a matter for the

appellate court and it is not for the parties to decide. [Rodrigo v. The Finance Co. Ltd. (2005) 2

Sri. L. R. 285 at 289]. I am persuaded to accept that the material documents to this application

are P2, P3, P12, P13 and P14 and that the Petitioner has complied with Rule 3(1) (a) of the 1990

Rules with regard to these documents.

I therefore overrule the 2nd preliminary objection raised by the learned President's Counsel for

the 1st Respondent.

Preliminary Objection No.3 - flh Respondent not a necessary party and must be struck off

The third and final preliminary objection raised by the learned President's Counsel on behalf of

the pt Respondent is that the 6th Respondent should be struck off as he is not a necessary party.

I am minded to state that this objection is not a preliminary objection as the term is generally

used. Tilakawardena J. in Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya v. Sri Lanka Ports Authority and another

[(2003) 3 Sri. L. R. 146 at 148] stated that "the advantage of a preliminary is the possibility to

dispose of a matter expeditiously which can lead to a resolution of the dispute between parties

with a minimum amount of expense or delay, for the convenience of all parties including the

Court".

Page 20 of 22

..

A pronouncement on the third preliminary objection raised by the learned President's Counsel

for the pt Respondent does not lead to a resolution of the dispute between parties. An answer

in favour of the 1st Respondent will only mean that the name of the 6th Respondent will be struck

off leaving the application of the Petitioner still to be determined on the merits.

I therefore overrule the 3rd preliminary objection raised by the learned President's Counsel for

the 1st Respondent.

For the reasons set out above, I am of the view that the Petitioner has made out a prima facie

case for notice to be issued on the Respondents.

The next question for consideration of Court is the interim relief sought by the Petitioner.

In Duwearatchi and another v. Vincent Perera and others [(1984) 2 Sri. l. R. 94] the Court of

Appeal held that the Court should be guided by the following principles in issuing an interim stay

order in a writ application:

(a) Will the final order be rendered nugatory if the Petitioner is successful?

(b) Where does the balance of convenience lie?

(c) Will irreparable mischief or injury be cause to either party?

The Petitioner was duly appointed as a Minister of the NPC. His case is that the 1st Respondent

has removed him from that post illegally when he did not have the power to do so. He is seeking

writs of certiorari which will restore the status quo ante. According to his pleadings the term of

the NPC ends in September 2018. At this point of time, the Respondents have not filed any

objections and it is not clear whether this matter can be concluded before the term of the NPC

ends. Therefore, I am of the view that the final order in this application will be rendered nugatory

if the Petitioner is successful unless interim relief is granted to the Petitioner. The balance of

convenience favours the Petitioner and irreparable mischief and injury will be caused to him

unless interim relief is granted. On the other hand, the interim relief will not prevent the

Petitioner from been duly removed from his post according to law. Hence there will be no

irreparable mischief or injury to the Respondents.

Page 21 of 22

For the foregoing reasons, I issue notice on the Respondents and grant the Petitioner the interim

reliefs prayed for in prayers b, c and d to the petition which reads as follows:

b. Issue an interim order restraining the Respondents from interfering with and/or

prohibiting and/or preventing and/or the Petitioner functioning as Minister of Fisheries,

Transport, Trade and Commerce, Rural Development, Trade & Commerce, Road

Development and Motor Traffic of the Northern Province;

c. Issue an Interim order suspending operation of "P12";

d. Issue an interim order suspending "P13"to the extent that the portfolios of Fisheries,

Transport, Trade and Commerce, Rural Development, Road Development and Motor

Traffic have been allocated to persons other than the Petitioner.

The Petitioner has stated that presently there are seven (7) Ministers with the Chief Minister in

the Board of Ministers of the NPC when the Constitution provides for only five (S) Ministers with

the Chief Minister. According to the Petitioner, the seven (7) are made up of the 1st to 6th

Respondents and the Petitioner. I have concluded that on the material before Court the

Petitioner has not been removed from the post of Minister according to law. The interim relief

is granted on that basis.

In view of the findings of this Court and the interim relief granted, it is for the appointing authority

to consider the constitutional restriction on the number of Ministers and take suitable action.

Registrar is directed to issue notice on the Respondents returnable on 9th July 2018. Interim relief

effective until 10th July 2018.
