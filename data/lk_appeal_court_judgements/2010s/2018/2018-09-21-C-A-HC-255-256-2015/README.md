ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The two Accused-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the "1st

Appellant" and the "2nd Appellant" respectively) were indicted before the

High Court of Negombo for the murder of Herath Mudiyanselage Priyantha

Chaminda on or about 3rd August 1997. Upon their election to be tried

without a jury, the 1st and 2nd Appellants were convicted for murder and

were sentenced to death. Being aggrieved by the said conviction and

sentence, the Appellants have preferred this appeal.

Learned President's Counsel for the 1st Appellant sought to

challenge the validity of the conviction on the basis that the trial Court has

failed to analyse the evidence of the prosecution and thereby arrived at an

erroneous finding. In support of the said ground of appeal, learned

President's Counsel relied on the following considerations;

2

i. the inconsistencies that exist in the prosecution case, in

relation to the factual position of who brought the gun to the

scene,

ii. the inconsistency that exists between the eye witness'

testimony and the opinion of the medical expert as to the

distance at which the gun was fired at the deceased,

111. the failure to call Don Jude Nishantha Appuhamy who has

apparently brought the gun to the scene and was arrested by

the Police as a suspect,

iv. deficiency of the evidence in relation to discovery of the gun

and particularly its production before the trial Court.

In support of the appeal of the 2nd Appellant, Learned President's

Counsel has raised following grounds of appeal, in addition to the

grounds raised by the 1st Appellant;

1. the evidence does not reveal any overt act by the 2nd

Appellant,

ii. the comparison of the defence evidence and arriving at a

finding that "the evidence of the 1st accused did not

corroborate the dock statement of the 2nd accused",

111. consideration of the denial of any involvement with the

incident by the 2nd Appellant as defence of alibi.

iv. Consideration of the contents of the statement and depositions

as evidence before the trial Court.

3

I,

In view of these grounds of appeal of the Appellants and before we

undertake consideration of the submissions in support of them in detail, at

least a cursory glance through the evidence presented before the trial

Court by the prosecution is warranted.

The case for the prosecution was based on eye witnesses account of

the incident and several other items of circumstantial evidence. The

deceased has died due to gunshot injuries to his chest, resulted in internal

injuries to heart, lungs and liver.

Witness Appuhamy is the father of the deceased. Witness Nalinda is a

brother of the deceased. Both these witnesses claim that they saw the

deceased being shot by the 1st Appellant in the company of the 2nd

Appellant.

In relation to the commencement of the series of incidents which

culminated with the act of shooting, the witness Appuhamy said in

evidence that his daughter was running an eatery in the building belonged

to the 2nd Appellant and the 1st Appellant was operating a grocery in close

proximity to the eatery. He also served food in his boutique. As the

popularity of the eatery run by his daughter rose, the 1st Appellant showed

his displeasure about it by harassing her customers.

On the day of the shooting, Appuhamy's daughter and her husband

returned to the eatery at about 8.30 or 9.00 p.m. having visited the hospital.

The witness was waiting in the front portion of the eatery which was

closed at that time due to the absence of his daughter. Then a group of

persons including the 1st Appellant arrived at the eatery and attacked the

4

eatery. He too was assaulted by the group. In fact, the attack commenced

with the assault on his young grandchild.

Upon the return of his daughter and her husband, the witness

narrated what happened during their absence. Then he decided to visit his

son, Nalinda who was residing about 100 to 200 fathoms away from the

eatery. Appuhamy thereafter returned to the eatery to sleep to find that the

group had again returned with clubs. A fellow villager intervened to settle

the unrest, and the crowd dispersed. When the witness returned to the

eatery, he was accompanied by the deceased, witness Nalinda and his

daughter.

After about 15 minutes of their return to the eatery, the two

Appellants also returned to it for the 3rd time armed with clubs. Again,

with the intervention of someone, an attack was averted. Then the two

Appellants have gone to the boutique and returned with a gun. Thereafter,

the 1st Appellant had fired a shot in the direction of the witness and two

others from a distance of 9 feet. The deceased was hit on his chest and the

two Appellants had ran towards their boutique taking the gun with them.

Nalinda in his evidence stated that he came to know about the initial

attack on the eatery through his father and when they arrived at the eatery

at about 9.00 p.m., the two Appellants came to attack them with clubs.

When the Appellants were pushed by the witness the 1st Appellant fired a

shot and ran away. He maintained that there was no enmity between him

and the 1st Appellant but said there was a problem about the eatery ran by

his sister.

5

The Police evidence reveals that they received 1st information about

the incident on 3rd August 1997 at about 11.55 p.m. and upon their visit to

the place of the incident, they have recovered a spent cartridge, a wooden

club and an iron pipe lying near the place of the incident, where blood

stains were also observed. Both the Appellants have surrendered to Police

two days after the incident, on 5th August 1997and upon information

provided by the 1st Appellant, a 12-bore shot gun was recovered hidden

under a culvert of an abandoned shrubby land.

Medical evidence reveals that the death of the deceased was due to

"internal bleeding as a result of gunshot injuries to heart, lungs and liver."

The medical officer who performed the post mortem examination on the

body of the diseased, stated that he observed blackening and tattooing

around the injuries caused by the pellets of the gun shot.

During his cross examination, the medical officer further explained

that the spread of the pellets he observed in the pattern of injuries indicate

that the deceased was at about 3 to 4 feet away from the muzzle end of the

gun. He based this opinion on the basis if it is a close range, then he would

not expect the spread of the pellets.

With this summery of evidence, we could now turn to consider the

several grounds of appeal as urged by the learned President's Counsel on

behalf of the Appellants.

Since both Appellants challenge the credibility of the two eye

witnesses and the reliance on their evidence by the trial Court, it is

appropriate to consider this ground at the outset.

6

, .

The contention of the Appellants is based on the fact that in relation

to the claim of Appuhamy that they ran back to their boutique, returned

with the gun and fired a shot. During cross examination, a contradiction

was marked as 1 V 4, as he has stated to Police that he saw one Krishantha

handing over a gun to the 1st Appellant. Similarly, during cross

examination of witness Nalinda a contradiction was marked as 1 V5 when

he said in evidence that he saw the 1st Appellant picking up a gun near the

lamp post, as he has stated in his deposition that the 1st Appellant had

picked up a gun from a thorny bush.

Learned President's Counsel, in their submissions on this particular

inconsistency, as to the way in which the 1st Appellant came to possess a

gun, has emphasised the fact that the trial Court had failed to consider the

credibility of the prosecution witness in the light of this important

inconsistency and had therefore arrived at an erroneous conclusion.

The trial Court, in its judgment has observed that the witnesses for

the prosecution were subjected to lengthy cross examination, but there was

no reason to doubt the truthfulness of their evidence.

It is noted by this Court that the learned trial Judge who convicted

the Appellant was not the trial Judge who recorded their evidence. He had

no opportunity of observing the demeanour and deportment of these

witnesses. In the circumstances, this Court is also placed at a similar

position as the learned trial Judge who convicted the Appellants, in

assessing whether the evidence of Appuhamy and Nalinda are truthful and

reliable version of events or not.

7

, .

The inconsistency marked as IV 4 off the evidence of Appuhamy

could be divided into two parts. In one part, the evidence of the witness

was consistent that the 1 st Appellant had a gun in his hand while the other

part as to how that gun came to his hand contradicts with his statement to

Police. Then, the evidence of the witness Appuhamy on this point

contradicts with the evidence of his son who said that the 1st Appellant

had picked up a gun from a nearby bush, whereas he attributes both the

Accused gone to the boutique and returned with a gun.

The fact that the 1st Appellant was having a gun at the place of

incident, is common to both witnesses. Obviously, there is an

inconsistency of Appuhamy's evidence inter se and per se on this factual

position. Then this Court must decide, in view of the submissions of the

Appellants, whether that is a material contradiction or not.

In the judgment of King v Mudalihamy 42 N.L.R. 103, it was decided

that in assessing a contradiction, it is necessary to examine the whole of his

deposition /I for the purpose of forming an opinion with regard to the

contradiction ... /1. This principle of evaluation was more clearly laid down

in Best Footware (Pvt) Ltd., and two Others v Aboosally and Others

(1997) 2 Sri L.R. 137, where it was emphasised that /I the Court should look at

the entirety and totality of the material placed before it in ascertaining whether the

contradiction is weighty or is trivial. .. ".

Another factor this Court should consider in this regard is the time

gap between the incident and giving evidence. It is alleged by the

prosecution that the incident had taken place on 3rd August 1997 whereas

the witnesses have given evidence in the latter part of 2010, more than 13

8

years later. Both these witnesses are average villagers and therefore their

credibility must be assessed in this back ground.

In Wickremasuriya v Dedoleena and Others (1996) 2 Sri L.R. 95,

Jayasuriya J observed that;

/I After a considerable lapse of time, as has resulted in this

application, it is customary to come across contradictions in the

testimony of witnesses. This is a true characteristic feature of

human testimony which is full of infirmities and weaknesses

especially when proceedings are held long after the events spoken

to by the witnesses. A judge must expect such contradictions to

exist in the testimony./1

His Lordship reproduced the test adopted in Jagathsena v

Bandaranaike (1984) 2 Sri L.R. 397that "Whether the discrepancy due to

dishonesty or to defective memory or whether the witnesses power of observations

were limited? "

The judgment of Samaraweera v The Attorney General (1990) 1 Sri

L.R. 256, in relation to the evaluation of proven false evidence, added that

" ... all falsehood is not deliberate. Errors of memory, faulty observation or lack of

skill in observation upon any point or points, exaggeration or mere embroidery or

embellishment must be distinguished from deliberate falsehood."

Turning to the appeal before us, it is seen upon the consideration of

the testimonies of both these witnesses, that they had added some

exaggeration to their evidence by providing an explanation to the question

as to how the 1st Appellant, having had a club in his hand, just before the

attack, all of a sudden possessed of a gun. Appuhamy explained it by

9

, , , ,

stating in evidence that they brought it from the boutique, whereas 13

years ago he attributed it to one Krishantha handing it over to the 1st

Appellant. On the contrary, his son had stated in his evidence that the 1st

Appellant just picked up a gun from a bush.

When considered in the light of the above principles of evaluation, it

is safe to assume both these witnesses have added their own explanation

to what each of them had not clearly observed. It is natural, when faced

with this type of challenge with a life-threatening risk, for these witnesses

to focus on the most threatening conduct to their safety. At one point, it

was an Appellant armed with an iron pipe and then at another point, the

1st Appellant armed with a gun. One cannot expect the description of the

sequence of events as accurately as observed by a detached witness to the

incident from a person who is under a threat of receiving a life-threatening

injury.

Therefore, it is our considered opinion, none of the witnesses have

uttered deliberate falsehood under oath, which would render their

evidence false and, on that account, unreliable.

When the evidence is considered in totality, especially the facts that

the Police recovered a spent cartridge from the scene, death was cased due

to gunshot injury and the subsequent recovery of a gun, against this

inconsistency, it could not be said that the said inconsistency would shake

the basic version of the prosecution.

In addition to this common ground of appeal, the 1st Appellant also

raised several grounds of appeal.

10

,

The complaint of the 1st Appellant is that there exists an

inconsistency between the eye witness testimony and the opinion of the

medical expert as to the distance at which the gun was fired from the

deceased which had gone unnoticed by the trial Court. It appears that

there is an inconsistency between the eye witnesses and the opinion of the

expert as to the distance. However, a close examination of the relevant

evidence clears any doubt that there is no such an inconsistency among the

witnesses. The distance of 9 feet was related by the lay witness is an

answer to the question put to him as to how far way the deceased was

from the 1st Appellant. There is no questioning as to the distance between

the muzzle end of the gun and the deceased. The evidence that are

available before the trial Court dispels any inconsistency. During cross

examination, the medical officer explained that the spread of the pellets he

observed in the pattern of injuries indicate that the deceased was at about

3 to 4 feet away from the muzzle end of the gun. He based this opinion on

the basis if it is a close range, then he would not expect the spread of the

pellets. As such this ground of appeal has no merits.

One of the other ancillary grounds of appeal of the 1st Appellant was

in relation to the failure of the prosecution to call Don Jude Nishantha

Appuhamy who has apparently brought the gun to the scene and was

arrested by the Police as a suspect. This complaint is made by the 1st

Appellant, not on the evidence led before the Court but on the contents of

a statement attributed to Appuhamy in 1 V 4. This factor only leaves the 1st

Appellant with the fact that Nishantha was also produced as a suspect only.

There is no material to conclude that he unfolds a narration, not spoken to

by other witnesses. In any event, his credibility as a witness would be

11

\ . , .

seriously impaired owing to the fact that he was initially arrested as a

suspect. We cannot appreciate the prejudice caused to the 1st Appellant

upon the failure to call him as a witness for the prosecution.

Lastly the ground of appeal based on the deficiency of the evidence

in relation to discovery of the gun and particularly its non-production

before the trial Court also could not be considered in favour of the 1st

Appellant as a defect in the prosecution's case that would vitiate his

conviction. The prosecution led ample evidence that in fact a gun was

recovered and handed the same to the Magistrate's Court, through which

it was sent to Government Analyst Department for analysis and report.

Due to a fire that erupted in the said Department, this item of production

was destroyed. But the documentary evidence clearly establishes to the

required level of proof that such a firearm in fact was recovered upon

information provided by the 1st Appellant.

In addition, the learned President's Counsel for the 1st Appellant

raised yet another ground of appeal at the hearing based on lesser

culpability in relation to him was not considered by the trial Court when it

is clear that there was a sudden fight. He contended that Appuhamy after

the initial act of aggression by the mob, has sought support from his two

sons to meet up the threat by the Appellants and the incident took place

when there was a sudden fight between these two factions.

This Court, in the judgment of CA 131/2000, C.A.M. of 10.09.2008,

held in respect of exception 4 to Section 294 of the Penal Code that;

12

, , \ ,

" ... in order to derive the benefit of this special exception, the

following ingredients will have to be fulfilled.

(a) The suddenness of the fight should be common to all

participants and should not be one sided where one of

the assailants with deliberate design to exploit the

situation wades in and launches an assault.

(b) The quarrel should be sudden to all antagonists

generating instantaneous heat of passion under the

influence of which the offence is committed.

(c) The offender should not have an undue advantage such

as attacking a defenceless unarmed person with a

deadly weapon.

(d) The offender should not have acted in a cruel or

unusual manner such as dealing repeated stab blows

with great force on a defenceless adversanj, where the

intention to kill is not the product of passion generated

instantaneously but more likely springing from malice

or vindictiveness." (emphasis original)

In addition, it was also held that 11 the burden of proof that the

circumstances come within the ambit of the plea of sudden fight devolves on the

offender on a balance of probability. Where one or more of the several elements that

needs to be proved are in doubt in relation to independent circumstances in each

case, then the plea cannot be said to be proved and therefore fail."

13

\ . . ,

It must be noted, in fairness to the 1st Appellant, the suggestion of a

sudden fight was put to the prosecution witnesses, who of course denied

it. Once it was also suggested that the gun was brought by the witness's

party and when the Appellant grappled for it, the gun went off accidently.

However, the evidence of the prosecution does not support a

sudden fight. Their evidence is that the Appellants were the aggressors

and after repeated acts of violence, the 1st Appellant had shot the deceased

at a short distance. In his evidence, the 1st Appellant claimed that Nalinda

and his brother-in-law had threatened them. One shanaka had a gun with

him and that frightened him. When he tried to take it away from Shan aka,

the gun accidently went off. The deceased was also standing close by when

the gun went off and he later learnt that the deceased has died due to a

gun shot. The evidence of the 1st Appellant was rightly rejected by the trial

Court based on improbability. It considered the nature and direction of the

gunshot wounds suffered by the deceased. The reference to shanaka was

made only in his evidence and could be considered as an afterthought.

We are in agreement with the submissions of the learned Deputy

Solicitor General that the evidence does not support such a proposition

and the 1st Appellant had failed to prove its existence to the required level

of proof, namely on a balance of probability.

In the circumstances, it is our considered view that the appeal of the

1st Appellant is devoid of merit and therefore owing to that reason, ought

to be dismissed.

The 2nd Appellant, also raised few other grounds of appeal in

addition to the common ground of appeal, that had already been dealt

14

I. ..

with in the preceding paragraphs of this judgment. One such additional

ground, as raised by the 2nd Appellant was that the evidence does not

reveal any overt act by him.

Upon consideration of the evidence, it appears that there is merit in

this submission. The evidence does not attribute the 2nd Appellant with

any specific act other than participating in a mob attack. Then, just before

the shooting he was seen with the 1st Appellant armed with a club. Then

the 1st Appellant shot the deceased. There was no utterences attributed to

the 2nd Appellant as to the deceased either for his death or causing any

injury, before or after the shooting incident. In short, there is insufficiency

of evidence in relation to common murderous intention.

This Court, in Rajadheera and Others v Attorney General (2008) 2

Sri L.R. 321, has followed the reasoning in King v Ranashnghe47 N.L.R.

373 and King v Piyadasa48 N.L.R. 295, where it was held that;

" ... in order to justify the inference that a particular prisoner was

actuated by a common intention with the doer of the act, there

must be evidence, direct or circumstantial, either of pre-

arrangement, or a pre-arranged plan, or a declaration showing

common intention, or some other significant fact at the time of the

commission of the offence, to enable them to say that a co-accused

had a common intention with the doer of the act, and not merely a

same or similar intention entertained independently of each

other. If

15

In view of the principles laid down, it is clear that there was

insufficiency of evidence to prove that the 2nd Appellant had common

murderous intention with the 1st Accused beyond a reasonable doubt.

Therefore, his appeal should be allowed by setting aside his conviction and

sentence. Other grounds of appeal, as urged by the 2nd Appellant does not

arise for consideration, in view of the above finding.

In the circumstances, this Court makes the following orders;

1. the appeal of the 1st Appellant is dismissed whilst affirming

his conviction and sentence,

ii. the appeal of the 2nd Appellant is allowed, whilst setting aside

his conviction and sentence.

Registrar is directed to communicate this order to the

Superintendent of Prisons as expeditiously as possible enabling him to

take necessary steps to release the 2nd Accused-Appellant forthwith.
