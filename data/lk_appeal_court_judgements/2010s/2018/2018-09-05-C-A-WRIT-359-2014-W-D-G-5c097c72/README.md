JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J (PIC A)

The Petitioner in this application prays for the following relief;

I. a writ of Certiorari to quash the decision contained, in the letter

dated 2013-12-30 and also in the Gazette notification bearing No.

1852/35 dated 2013-03-05,

II. a writ of Prohibition to restrain the 1st and 5th to 12th Respondents

from taking any steps towards the enforcement of the order referred

to in the said letter dated 2013-12-30 produced marked A 21,

When this Court took this case up for argument on the 9th March 2018

learned Counsel for the 3rd Respondent and the learned counsel for the 1st

and 5th to 21st Respondents raised certain preliminary objections against

the maintainability of this application before this Court.

It was pOinted out by the learned counsel for the 3rd Respondent that the

main prayer in this application is for a writ of certiorari to quash the

decision contained in the Gazette notification bearing No. 1852/35 dated

05-03-2013. It was further pOinted out by the learned counsel for the 3rd

Respondent that the said Gazette has been issued by the Hon. Minister of

..

10

Finance who is not a party to this application. It is therefore the submission

of the learned counsel for the 3rd Respondent that the Petitioner seeks to

quash the vesting order issued by the Hon. Minister of Finance without

making the said Hon. Minister a party to this application. Since the

Petitioner has failed to add all necessary parties to this application, the

learned counsel for the 3rd Respondent submits that this court should not

permit the Petitioner to maintain this writ application.

Learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner concedes that according to

settled legal principles referred to in the judicial precedence, a Court

exercising powers of judicial review cannot quash a vesting order issued by

the Minister without making the relevant minister a party to the relevant

application.

In these circumstances, this Court cannot entertain the application of the

Petitioner any further.

However, the learned President's Counsel for the Petitioner makes an

application to amend the Petition by making the Hon. Minister a party at

this stage. Learned Counsel for the Respondents have raised their

objections to the said application.

11

This Court observes that the Petitioner has filed this application on the 20th

October 2014. This Court also observes that the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner has moved time to file an amended caption on 13-02-2015. The

Petitioner had indeed filed an amended caption on the 2sth March 2015.

Petitioner has again moved to file an amended caption on the 18th June

2015 and indeed filed the 2nd amended caption on the 29th June 2015.

It was on the 4th September 2015 that this Court, upon this application

being supported for notices by the learned counsel for the Petitioner, had

decided to issue notices on the Respondents.

Thereafter, with filing of pleadings being completed this Court has fixed

this case for argument for the 28th November 2016. Thereafter, this Court

having re-fixed the argument of this case several times namely, 6th April

2017, 14th September 2017, and had re-fixed it for the 9th March 2018 on

which date this Court took this case up for argument. It is thereafter (i.e.

almost 5 years after filing of the petition), that the Petitioner is now

requesting permission to add the party, which is the most crucial party to

this application. That is also after the Respondents had raised objections to

the maintainability of this application on the basiS that the said party is not

before Court.

12

The petitioner has not adduced any acceptable reason for the said lapse on

his part. The Petitioner has not explained to the satisfaction of this Court as

to why she has failed to add the most crucial party to this application even

when the consequence of such failure was within her knowledge.

The Petitioner has failed to rectify this error even when she was granted

time at several occasions to redesign the caption. She has failed to check

whether all-requisite parties have been named as respondents. Petitioner

has also not explained the delay incurred in making the instant application

to amend the caption again.

In the case of Dominic Vs Minister of Lands and others1 His Lordship

Sriskandarajah J having considered the judicial precedence pertaining to

the above question had held that an application made at the stage of

argument to add some new respondents as parties to the case will be

allowed only if the case is not yet ready for final disposal by Court. He had

further held that once the final hearing of the application by Court

commences, such an application made thereafter would be refused, as it is

a belated application.

1 2010 Sri. L. R. 388.

13

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons this Court has no

basis to allow the application made by the learned President's Counsel for

the Petitioner to add a totally new party to this application at this stage.

Thus, this Court decides to refuse the said application.

This Court cannot continue to entertain this application in the absence for

the Hon. Minister who had issued the vesting order, which the Petitioner

seeks to quash. Therefore, this Court decides to uphold the preliminary

objection raised by the learned counsel for the 3rd Respondent and hold

that this application cannot be maintained.

Hence, this Court decides to dismiss this application in limine with costs.

Application dismissed in limine with costs.
