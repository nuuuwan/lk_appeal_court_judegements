The appellant was indicted in the High Court of Anuradhapura

under section 296 of the Penal Code for the murder of his wife Oeepika

Kumari and under section 198 of the Penal Code for concealing her body

in a pit thereby causing disappearance of evidence of the offence referred

to in the first charge. After trial he was convicted for both charges and

imposed death sentence for the first charge and 7 years RI was imposed

for the second charge with a fine of Rs. 5,000/= with a default term of 3

months.

The appellant did not contest the conviction imposed on him under

section 198 of the Penal Code. His only ground of appeal was to vary the

2

conviction and sentence of death for lesser culpability under section 197

of the Penal Code on the basis of a sudden fight and cumulative

provocation.

According to the prosecution the appellant was married to the

decease and living in a village called Pemaduwa in the Anuradhapura

District. Mother of the deceased had heard from one of her daughters

Pradeepa Kumari that the deceased had gone missing with the child she

was expecting. She has gone to the daughter's house and the appellant

has told her that the deceased went to the witness's house to deliver the

baby. She has testified that she saw the house they were living has been

burnt down. Thereafter she has searched for her daughter and failing to

find her, she has made a complaint to the police. This witness has told

the High Court that her daughter did not have any disputes with the

appellant.

The police had received an anonymous petition on the 17/0912003

and based on this petition the appellant had been arrested and also

based on this petition they have dug a certain place in the appellant's

compound and had found the body of the deceased. After arrest the

appellant had made a statement under section 127 (3) of the Code of

Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of 1979 (as amended) to the Magistrate

of Anuradhapura. The prosecution in this case mainly relied on this

confession to prove this case.

In the said confession the appellant inter alia admitted that he

assaulted the wife with his hand and she fell unconscious and that after

trying to revive her and failing buried her in a pit in the garden.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued that there had been

constant fights between the appellant and the deceased which provoked

the appellant to hit the deceased. The main ground of appeal canvassed

by the appellant is that the learned High Court Judge has not considered

the facts in the confession to establish lesser culpability of the appellant.

Medical evidence reveals that the deceased was assaulted with a

blunt weapon, which fact the deceased has suppressed in his confession.

He has not specifically denied this fact in his dock statement.

Although the appellant in his confession states that he tried to

revive the deceased he failed to get assistance from witness Margaret

who was living next door, nor did he try to take her to a doctor. The

medical evidence reveals that the deceased who was expecting a baby

has died of suffocation within ten minutes after burial.

It has been held in Nagamari Theivendran vs AG in S.C. appeal

65/2000 decided on 16/10/02 that an accused could be convicted solely

on a confession made to a judicial officer. This case was followed by

Suduaiya and others vs AG 1 SLR 2005 p.358. On a perusal of the

evidence of the Magistrate we find that the Magistrate has given the

appellant sufficient time to consider before making the statement and has

explained that if he voluntarily makes a confession such confession could

be used against by him in a court of Law. When considering the relevant

steps taken by the Magistrate one can not say the said confession was

not made voluntarily. Therefore the position taken up in the dock

statement by the appellant that he was forced to make the confession

appears to be an afterthought.

The learned counsel for the appellant cited the judgments in The

King vs Loku Nona and two others 11 NLR 4 and R vs Thabo Meli

1954 1 NLR 228. We perused these two judgments and find that the facts

in those cases can be distinguished from the instant case.

-

On perusal of the judgment of the learned High Court Judge we

find that the learned High Court Judge has correctly analysed the

evidence and convicted the appellant. We see no reason to set aside a

well considered judgment. We affirm the judgment dated 15/11/2016 and

"-~dismiss.rthe appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
