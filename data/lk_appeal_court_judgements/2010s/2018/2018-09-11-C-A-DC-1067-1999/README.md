Pubudu De Silva with D.D.P. Dassanayake for the Substituted 4th Defendant-Appellant

Defendant-Respondents

This is an appeal against the judgment of the Learned District Judge of

Kegalle in respect of a Partition action No. 21876/P. The original Plaintiffs

instituted this action seeking to partition the land called "Hitinawatta"

more fully described in the Schedule to the Plaint in an extent of 15 Laha.

(plan No. 06 made by P. B. Wijesundera Licensed Surveyor marked as "X"

and produced and filed of record).

According to the plaint, shares should be devolved on the 15t to 4th Plaintiffs

and 15t - 3rd Defendants; shares have not been allocated to the 4th and 5th

Defendants. But the 4th and 5th Defendants were made as a party because they

have entered in to the corpus and they have made Wattle house before one

month prior to the filing of this action (vide page 81 of the brief).

6

The 4th Defendant-Appellant filed his statement of claims with the 5th, 6th and

7th Defendants jointly.

The District Court trial was taken up on 27th September 1988 and only the 2nd

Plaintiff and the 2nd Defendant were present. Thereafter, the judgment dated

15th January 1990 was delivered in favour of the 2nd Plaintiff and the order was

made to enter Interlocutory Decree as prayed by the Plaintiffs; shares have not

been allotted to the 4th and 5th Defendants.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment, the 4th Defendant - Appellant filed a

notice of Appeal on 24.01.1990, under Section 48(4) of the Partition Law to

set aside the Interlocutory Decree. However, the Petition of Appeal has not

been filed on the same day.

The inquiry was held and evidence was led on behalf of the 4th Defendant-

Appellant. He stated that due to terrorist activities operated in the area

prevented his coming to the Courts on that particular day. However, at the

end of the inquiry the Learned District Judge by her order dated 6th December

1999 dismissed the aforementioned application, therefore, the request to

vacate the interlocutory decree not allowed.

Being dissatisfied with the said order dated 06.12.1999, this appeal was filed

by the 4th Defendant-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the 'Appellant')

praying to set aside the judgment of the Learned District Judge dated 15th

January 1990.

The Appellant's position is that ongoing appeal is a fmal appeal with regard to

a dismissal of his purge default application filed under section 48 (4) (a) (iv);

Whilst, in their written submissions that the Plaintiff-Respondents took up a

Preliminary objection stating that the order dated 06.12.1999 is not a

judgment and it is an order within the meaning of section 754(2) of the Civil

7

Procedure Code which an appeal may be preferred with the leave of the Court

of Appeal.

Learned Counsel for the Appellant further submitted that as the Learned

District Judge by the said order, has finally disposed of the rights of the

appellant, the order was a final order.

Therefore, this Court has to decide whether the questioned order dated

06.12.1999 is a final judgment or an order which comes under section 754(2)

of the Civil Procedure Code. In order to decide this question, I would like to

consider certain judicial decisions.

In Shubrook vs. Tufnell (1882) 9 QBD 621, where Jessel, MR and Lindley, LJ

held that, an order is final if it fmally determines the matter in litigation. Thus

the issue of fmal and interlocutory depended on the nature and the effect of

the order made.

In Ranjith vs. Kusumawathie (1998) 3 SLR 232 that Supreme Court has held that

the interlocutory decree is not final and the order of the District Court is not a

judgment within the meaning of section 754(1) and 754(5) of Civil Procedure

Code for purpose of an appeal.

In Salter Rex and Co. vs. Gosh (1972) 2 All ER 865 Lord Denning, M. R. stated:

"If their decision whichever way it is given, will if it stands finally dispose of

matter in dispute, I think that for the purpose of these Rules it is final. On the

other hand, if their decision, if given in one way, will finally dispose of the

matter in dispute, but, if given in the order, will allow the action to go on, then I

think it is not final, but interlocutory. 11

8

In Siriwardene Vs Air Ceylon Ltd (1984) 1 SLR page 286 Sharwannada J (as he

then was) held thus: "The tests to be applied to determine whether the order

has the effect of a final judgment and so qualifies as a judgment under section

754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code are:

a) It must be an order finally disposing the rights of the parties.

b) The order cannot be treated as a fmal order, if the suit or the action is

still left alive suit or action for the purpose of determining rights and

liabilities of the parties in the ordinary way.

c) The finality of the order must be determined in relation to the suit.

d) The mere fact that a cardinal point in the suit has been decided or even

a vital and important issue determined in the case, is not enough to

make an order a final one.

It's important to have an attention to the facts in this matter for consider the

issue that whether the Appellant's rights were affected in a final and

conclusive manner.

When the inquiry was held, the 4th Defendant-Appellant and 3 other persons

gave evidence. In his evidence the 4th Defendant testified that due to unrest of

the country in 1988 transportation system was not properly activated and there

were no buses available in Maharangalle to Kegalle.

Therefore, he was unable to present in Court on that particular day

27.09.1988. But regarding the 2nd Plaintiff-Respondent he had own vehicle in

the said period of time.

The 4th Defendant-Appellant further added that,

At page 144 witnesses further stated that buses did not work in a schedule in

the questioned time period.

Even though The Learned District Judge did not satisfy with the evidence

adduced at the inquiry and refused the 4th Defendant-Appellants Application.

The learned judge was reasoning that the Appellant was not taking any careful

steps to appear by his personal capacity or by the way of an attorney.

I am in a view that, the facts of the case and averments of the Appellants

cannot be sustained. Its trite law through few land mark precedents, as held in

Wickremarathne vs. Samarawickrama (1995) 2 SLR 212, who did not appear at

the trial and whose rights in the corpus have been extinguished by the

interlocutory decree may apply for special leave to establish his rights.

N ow I again recall the decision of Ranjit vs. Kusumawathie and others. In this

case the original 4th Defendant having filed his statement of claim failed to

appear at the trial and the evidence was led for the Plaintiff, other parties been

absent, the judgment and the interlocutory decree were entered accordingly.

The original 4th Defendant applied to the trial Court, in terms of sub section 48

(4)(a)(iv) of the Partition Law, for special leave which permits a defaulting

party to make an application to enter the case. The application for special

leave was rejected by the District Court. The appellant then preferred an

appeal to the Court of Appeal against the order, in terms of subsection 754(1)

of the Civil Procedure Code as if that order made by the District Court was a

"judgment". The Court of Appeal rejected the appeal on the basis that what

was appealed from was an "order" within the meaning of subsection 754(2) of

11

the Civil Procedure Code and that therefore an appeal could lie only with

leave of the Court of Appeal fIrst had and obtained. This appeal relates to that

rejection.

In this case, the main issue was whether the refusal of the Application made

under section 48(4)(a)(iv) is a judgment contemplated under section 754 (1) or

an order under 754 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Dheerarathne, J. in his judgment (at page 238) stated that:

"A party to a partition action making an application in tenns of subsection

48(4)(a)(iv) in order to establish his right, title or interest, has two hurdles

to sunnount. First he has to satisfy court, in tenns of subsection (c) that (i)

having filed his statement of claim and registered his address, he failed to

appear at the trial owing to accident, misfortune or other unavoidable

cause, and (ii) that he had a prima facie right, title or interest in the

corpus, and (iii) that such right, title or interest has been extinguished or

such party has been otherwise prejudicially affected by the interlocutory

decree. Then only the court will grant special leave. After granting special

leave, in tenns of subsection (d), the court will settle in the fonn of issues

the questions of fact and law arising from the pleadings relevant to the

claim and then appoint a day for trial and detennination of the issues. The

second hurdle the party has to sunnount is the detennination of those

issues by court after trial, in tenns of subsection (e).

The order appealed from is an order made against the appellant at the first

hurdle. Can one say that the order made on the application of the 4th

defendant is one such that whichever way the order was given, it would

have finally detennined the litigation? Far from that, even if the order was

12

given in favour of the appellant, he has to face he second hurdle, namely

the trial to vindicate his claim"

Dheerarathne, J. followed the judgments of Lord Esher in Salaman vs. Warner

(1891) 1 QB 734, and Lord Denning's judgment in Salter Rex vs. Gosh (supra)

which adopted the application approach and held that the order appealed

from is not a "judgment" within the meaning of subsections 754(1) and

754(5) of the Civil Procedure Code.

In my opinion, the above quoted observation of Dheerarathne, J is pertinent to

the decision of this case.

Further, I think it's important to have a note on the decision of

Abeygunasekara vs. Wijesekara and Others (2002) 2 SLR 269, in this case, the

defendant appealed against the order made under section 48(4) of the Partition

Law. The Plaintiff raised a preliminary objection by way of a motion that no

appeal lies against an order made under section 48(4). But the defendant

argued that 'with the inherent revisionary jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal,

the matter can be entertained under section 48(4) of the Partition Law'. But

Somawansa, J. held that: the defendant has no ri~ht to direct appeal against the

impugned order, therefore, it will not cause any prejudice to him.

And Somawansa, J. further held that:

"] am inclined to take the view that the inherent power of the Court could be

invoked only where provisions have not been made, but where provision has been

made and are provided in section 752(2) of the Civil Procedure Code inherent

power of this court cannot be invoked; inherent powers cannot be invoked to

disregard express statutory provisions"

13

Therefore, I hold that order given by the Learned District Judge is not a final

order and the Appellant should have filed a leave to Appeal Application under

section 754(2) instead of filling an appeal under section 754(1) of the Civil

Procedure Code.

For the forgoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the judgment of the

Learned District Judge; therefore, the appeal is dismissed without costs.
