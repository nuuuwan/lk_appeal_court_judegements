& Decided on: 02.11.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner filed this application for revision and/or restitutio

in integrum dated 17.08.2004 seeking to set aside the Judgment

and the Interlocutory Decree entered by the learned District

Judge of Kalutara dated 23.02.1999 in the Partition Case No.

6658/P.

It is the position of the petitioner that he came to know about

the partition action when the surveyor came to the land to

prepare the final scheme of partition. This has happened on 14-

16 March 2000.

In the facts and circumstances of this case, this is not

believable. Assuming this is correct, the petitioner has come

before this Court four years and five months after he became

aware of the case.

There cannot be any dispute that this is an unreasonable delay

unless the delay can be explained. A person who is invoking the

extraordinary jurisdiction of this Court by way of revision

and/or restitutio in integrum must act in promptitude.

3

The petitioner knows it and therefore explains the delay in

paragraphs 20-22 of the petition. What the petitioner in those

paragraphs says is that, as he was not a party to the case, he

could not seek relief from the Court, but he awaited until the

outcome of the application of the 11A defendant who made an

application to the District Court to set aside the Judgment and

the Interlocutory Decree, and the District Court allowed that

application by order dated 16.10.2001, which was later set aside

by this Court on 28.06.2004.

In a revision application, there is no necessity for this Court to

call for the original case record from the District Court. The law

requires the petitioner to tender all the material documents.

However, in this case, this Court has called for the original case

record for another purpose.

When I go through the original case record, it is clear that the

above explanation of the petitioner contains serious

suppressions and misrepresentations of core matters.

The learned District Judge, in the Judgment, has left of the

corpus unallotted. The petitioner together with nine others

including his mother-Ranso Nona (who were not parties to the

case) has made an application to the District Court by way of a

petition dated 02.05.2000 and an affidavit dated 24.05.2000

seeking permission to lead evidence to claim their undivided

rights from the portion left unallotted and thereafter to amend

the Interlocutory Decree and prepare a fresh scheme of

partition.1 The petitioners proxy dated 24.05.2000 and the

1 Vide pages 230-237 of the original Case Record.

4

petitioners mothers proxy dated 19.03.2000 are also found in

the original case record.2 The petitioner has suppressed this

vital fact from this Court and the said application (made by way

of petition and affidavit) has not been tendered to this Court.

Thereafter the matter has been fixed for the inquiry by the

District Court and according to the proceedings dated

20.11.2000, at the inquiry, the present petitioner has given

evidence without any objection from anybody including the

Attorney-at-Law of the plaintiffs.3 Without any reference to such

application or inquiry, I find those proceedings among other

documents tendered by the petitioner.

The petitioners claim is for Lot 3 in the Preliminary Plan

together with the house standing thereon. This he has claimed

in his evidence at the inquiry.

After leading all the evidence, for reasons best known to the

petitioner and his lawyer, the application has been withdrawn.4

It must be mentioned that, at that time, although the scheme of

partition had been prepared by the surveyor as per the

Interlocutory Decree, no Scheme Inquiry had been held.

I guess that the petitioner and nine others withdrew that

application placing reliance on the prospect of success of the

application of the 11A defendant, which ultimately did not

materialize.

2 Vide pages 410 and 411. 3 Vide pages 351-357 of the original Case Record. 4 Vide last page of the said proceedings.

5

I must mention that the petitioner did not withdraw that

application after the District Court allowed the application of the

11A respondent, but well before it. The petitioner withdrew that

application on 20.11.2000 and the District Court allowed the

11A defendants application on 16.10.2001.

This suppression, in my view, is a serious suppression. Revision

is a discretionary remedy, and the party who is seeking that

remedy, must act with uberimma fides (utmost good faith). If he

is later found to have acted in a manner to deceive the Court,

the Court need not go into the merits of the matter, but shall

dismiss the application in limine without further ado. That is

settled law.

In that backdrop, even though it is absolutely not necessary, let

me consider, for completeness, the other aspects of the

petitioners application.

The petitioner says that his mother-Ranso Nona who was a

claimant before the surveyor was not served with Notice as

required by the Partition Law and therefore she was not aware of

the case until the surveyor came to the land for final division.

According to the Report of the Preliminary Plan, there had been

two claimants-Mary Nona and Ranso Nona-to whom Notices

have been served by the surveyor. The fact that Notice was

served is denied not by Ranso Nona but by his son-the

petitioner. Ranso Nona (now deceased) was a party to the

application which I referred to earlier (which was suppressed

from this Court). Nowhere in that application does Ranso Nona

make such an allegation. She was claiming rights from the

6

unallotted portion. Soon after the Preliminary Survey, the other

claimant-Mary Nona (to whom the surveyor says Notice was

served) has filed the proxy.5 That also belies the petitioners

assertion that Notice was not served on her mother. What more,

according to the Report of the Preliminary Plan, Lot 3 and the

building and plantation standing thereon have been claimed by

Ranso Nona and it has so been recorded by the surveyor.

Therefore, there is no room whatsoever to say that she was not

given Notice. According to section 18(2) of the Partition Law, No.

21 of 1977, as amended, such Report of the Surveyor can be

used as evidence without further proof subject to making an

application by any party to call the surveyor to give oral

evidence.

The petitioner relies only on the Deed No. 3864 marked P5 to

claim rights from the corpus. There had been another Partition

Case No. 6656/P to the adjoining land. The petitioner who is

admittedly the 8th defendant in that case, has claimed title to the

land to be partitioned in that case also on the same Deed and

the learned District Judge in that case has accepted that Deed

and given rightsvide the statement of claim marked X1, the

Judgment marked X3 and the Final Plan marked X2 tendered by

the learned counsel for the plaintiffs. The petitioner has

suppressed that fact also from this Court. That means, the

rights stemming from that Deed have been finally decided, and

the petitioner cannot now produce the same Deed to claim title

to the adjoining land which is the subject matter of the present

case. The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner draws

5 Vide JE No.15 of the DC Case Record and the proxy is found at page 403 of the Case Record.

7

the attention of the Court to Plan X2 referred to above and the

other Plan (P6) mentioned in the Deed 3864, and points out

that, a part of Lot 3 has not been included to the corpus in the

other case. If that is so, the petitioner as the 8th respondent

should have taken steps in that case (No.6656/P) to show the

entire Lot 3.

Taking all the facts and circumstances into account, I refuse to

issue Notice and dismiss the Application but without costs.
