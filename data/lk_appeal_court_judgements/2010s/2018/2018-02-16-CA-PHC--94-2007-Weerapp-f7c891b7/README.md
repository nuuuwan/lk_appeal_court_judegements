Judgment

S.Thurairaja PC J

The Respondent -Petitioner - Appellant (Hereinafter sometimes referred as the

Appellant) is seeking to set aside an order dated 20th July 2007, issued by the Learned

Judge of the High Court of Kandy.

The Appellant was occupying a land at Ambakotte, Kengalla, Kandy. Both parties agreed

that the land is belongs to the State. The Appellant says that he has permission and the

Mahawelli Authority who is the Plaintiff - Respondent -Respondent (Hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Respondent), says that the portion that the Appellant

claimed was not given to them and that the Appellants were occupying the said land

without any legal permission. Quit notices were issued, matter was referred to the

Magistrate of Teldeniya to get the possession of the said land. The Magistrate also issued

an order to quit against the Appellants. Being aggrieved with the said order the Appellants

filed a revision application at the Provincial High Court of Kandy on the following grounds;

a) The summons was not properly served.

b) The Respondent (Mahaweli Authority) is not a Competent Authority.

The learned Judge of the High Court after hearing submissions of both parties had

decided that the summons was not properly served, hence, he referred the matter back

to the Magistrate to follow the proper procedure.

Being unsatisfied with the said order of the Judge of the High Court, the Appellants

-Preferred this appeal to this Court and framed following grounds of appeal;

i). Whether the 1st Appellant has been summoned by a proper summons.

ii). Whether the Appellant has suffered a grave prejudice by not summoning by a

proper summons. (sic)

CA(PHC) 94/2007 JUDGMENT Page 3 of 5

iii). Whether the Respondent is the Competent Authority;

We carefully considered the Order of the Learned High Court Judge, (at page 107 of the

appeal brief) he had considered the issue of issuing of summons comprehensively. But,

the issue raised regarding the Competent Authority was not considered.

The appellants submit that the Respondent is not a competent Authority under Section

18 (h) and (/) of the State Land Recovery of Possession Act.

Section 18 (h) and (i) is reproduced for easy reference:

Section 18 competent authority" used in relation to any land means the Government

Agent, an Additional Government Agent or an Assistant Government Agent of the

district in which the land is situated and, includes,

18(h) the head of any other Government Department or Institution being a

department or institution created by law, where such land is under the control of

such department or institution.

18(i) the Commissioner of Local Government, where such land is under the control

of a local authority;

18{l) an officer generally or specially authorized by a corporate body, where such

land is vested in or owned by or under the control ot such corporate body.

The Respondent is a Resident Project Manager of Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka. Quit

Notice dated 25th February 2005, which was marked as P 16 clearly shows that the

Respondent had signed the said notice as a competent authority.

Considering the relevant laws and regulations it is proved that the Respondent is a

Competent Authority as stipulated under the State Land Recovery of Possession Act,

therefore that ground of appeal fails on its own merits.

Regarding the other ground of appeal namely that the summons were not properly

served, the learned High Court Judge had decided to direct the Magistrate to follow the

accepted procedures, hence we have no reason to interfere with the said order.

Considering the matters discussed above this court dismiss the appeal with costs. The

cost is estimated at Rupees 12500/-

The Magistrate hereby directed to follow the orders of the learned Judge of the Provincial

High Court.
