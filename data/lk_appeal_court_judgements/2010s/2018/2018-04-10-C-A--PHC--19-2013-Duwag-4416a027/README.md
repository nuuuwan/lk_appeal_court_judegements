JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

The Officer in Charge of Mathugama Police Station had filed the

information relevant to this case in the Primary Court under section 66 (1)

(a) of the Primary Court Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred

to as the Act). The 1st Party - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 1st Respondent) and the 2nd Party - Petitioner

- Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Appellant) has been

named as the rival parties in the said information.

The said information has alleged that the Appellant had obstructed the

road regularly used by the 1st Respondent.

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into the complaint contained

in the said information, by his order dated 2011-10-16 , had held that the

1 st Respondent is entitled to the impugned right of way.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the learned Primary Court Judge, the

Appellant had made a revision application in the Provincial High Court of

-

6

Western Province holden in Kalutara urging the Provincial High Court to

revise the order of the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, by its judgment dated

2013-03-28 had refused the said application for revision and proceeded to

dismiss it. The Provincial High Court has taken the view that there is no

basis to interfere with the learned Magistrate's order.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has filed this appeal in this

Court.

Perusal of the written submission filed by the Appellant shows that it is no

more than a reproduction of the arguments advanced on his behalf in the

Primary Court. They are arguments based on factual positions. It does not

set out any ground, which is at least suggestive of any illegality or any

impropriety of the impugned order. Therefore, this Court is not inclined to

re consider them again one by one.

In the instant case, the Appellant does not complain about any irregularity

of proceedings.

7

According to section 74 of the Act an order of the Primary Court Judge

under part VII of the Act shall not prejudice any right or interest in any

land which any person may establish in a civil suit.

This Court in the case of Jayasekarage Bandulasena and others V Galla

Kankanamge Chaminda Kushantha and others1 held thatthe right of

appeal provided by law to this Court in cases of this nature would only

empower this Court to evaluate the correctness of the exercise of the

revisionary jurisdiction by the Provincial High Court. This Court also held in

that case that such an appeal could not be converted to an appeal against

a Primary Court Order.

This Court observes that in the instant case also it is the revisionary

jurisdiction, which the Provincial High Court was called upon to exercise.

Further, it would be relevant to reproduce the following passage from a

judgment of this Court in the case of Punchi Nona V Padumasena and

1 C A (PHC) /147/2009 decided on 2017-09-27. 21994 (2) Sri. L R 117.

" The jurisdiction conferred on a primary Court under section 66 is a

special jurisdiction. It is a quasi-criminal jurisdiction. The primary object of

the jurisdiction so conferred is the prevention of a breach of the peace

arising in respect of a dispute affecting land. The Court in exercising this

jurisdiction is not involved in an investigation into title or the right to

possession which is the function of a civil Court. He is required to take

action of a preventive and provisional nature pending final adjudication of

rights in a civil Court ... "

Thus, it is the view of this Court that there had been no basis for the

Provincial High Court to interfere with the conclusion of the learned

Primary Court Judge, as there had been no basis to satisfy itself that the

order made by the learned Primary Court Judge is either illegal or improper

as required by section 364 of the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No. 15 of

1979.

It is the view of this Court that the Appellant has failed to prove to the

satisfaction of Court that they is any merit in this appeal.

-

In these circumstances and for the foregoing reasons this Court decides to

dismiss this appeal without costs.

Appeal is dismissed without costs.
