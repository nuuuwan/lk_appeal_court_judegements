M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

The deceased Plaintiff-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the "Appellant")

instituted this action in the District Court of Galle against 20 Defendants

seeking inter alia, a decree of partition of the land called

Madakadahenathuduwe Deniya more fully described in paragraph 2 of the

plaint dated 11 th December 1973.

However, it is seen from the journal entries that after 08.03.1974 there were

no entries/records whatsoever taken by the Appellant to proceed this case

until 17.09.1990 (vide page 20 & 21 of the appeal brief).

On 17.09.1990, the Appellant made an application for an interim injunction

and an enjoining order preventing the 19th and 20th Defendant-Respondents

(hereinafter referred to as the "Respondents") build up any buildings on the

land sought to be partitioned, and the Court was granted those interim reliefs

in the first instance on or around 19.06.1991 (vide page 23 ofthe brief).

Subsequently, on 21.01.1992 the interim injunction sought by the Appellant

was also granted (page 157, 158 of the brief). However, the Respondents (on

14.05.1997) made an application under Section 666 of the Civil Procedure

Code to set aside the interim injunction and an inquiry was held in that regard,

but later, parties agreed to dispose of the inquiry by written submissions (vide

page 159-183 of the brief).

It is also to be noted that on 03.06.1998 the learned Additional District Judge

of Galle, delivering the order, set aside the interim injunction and fixed the

case for 14.08.1998 finally, directing the Appellant to take all necessary steps

to prosecute the action (page 184-186 of the brief). Since the Appellant failed

8

to comply with the aforesaid direction, on 14.08.1998, the Appellant's action

was dismissed for non-prosecution (page 57 Of the brief). However, this

dismissal of action was later set aside consequent to an application made by

the Appellant (vide page 58 of the brief).

Thereafter, on 21.05.1999, when the case was called in open Court, the

Appellant was absent and unrepresented and the Respondents made an

application to dismiss the action. Accordingly, the Appellant's action was

dismissed (vide page 59 of the brief).

The Appellant had subsequently filed papers including an affidavit dated

02.06.1999 to set aside the order dated 21.05.1999. In the affidavit dated

02.06.1999, the Appellant had stated that this case was to be called on

21.05.1999 in the District Court of Galle Court No. 01 before the District Court

Judge and that the Appellant and his instructing Attorney had been waiting in

the same Court room for their case to be called (vide page 124-128 of the

brief). At this inquiry, the application was strongly opposed by the

Respondents; and the Respondents initially moved to file objections on

16.08.1999, but their objection was articulated in open Court. Consequently,

the District Court rejected the Appellant's application to set aside the

dismissal of the action on the ground that it had no jurisdiction or authority to

make an order in that regard (vide journal entry No. 74; page 60-61 of the

brief).

Being aggrieved with the said order dated 16.08.1990 the Appellant filed this

appeal seeking for an order to set aside the order of dismissal and be

restored to the calling cases roll. The Appellant seeks this court's intervention

on the following grounds:

Ii ,

!

9

1. The said order dated 16.0B.1999, is contrary to law;

2. The learned Additional District Judge has not held an inquiry to

ascertain the facts stated by the Appellant in his petition and affidavit

dated 02.06.1999 and has thereby erred in law in dismissing this

application of the Appellant to purge default; and

3. The learned Additional District Judge has failed to consider that when

case was dismissed on 21.05.1999, the step was summons returnable

on the BA Defendant, and according to the prevailing law at that time

no steps were needed to be taken against deceased defendant, and

the learned Additional District Judge has erred in law in dismissing the

Appellant's case on 21.05.1999 (as per Petition of Appeal dated

14.10.1999).

In this appeal, the Appellant's submission was that due to the said District

Court-order dated 16.0B.1999 to dismiss the Partition Case, which had been

going on for 26 years up to that time, where the Appellant had taken all

necessary steps to serve summons on all the parties, and where the case

could have been fixed for trial without any further delay, was unduly

dismissed. Accordingly, the Appellant further submitted that all of the efforts of

the Appellant in bringing this case to the stage of trial was abruptly halted due

to the said order of dismissal of the learned District Court Judge.

In this case, the Appellant moved in to action by filing an application with an

affidavit to purge his default. In the inquiry the Appellant stated that, when the

case had been called in the District Court room No. 02, whereas in fact the

case should have been called in District Court room No. 01, where the

Appellant and his Attorney-at-Law were waiting. He further stated that the

said fateful day namely 21.05.1999 is a calling date; and there is no provision

10

in the Partition Act to dismiss a case on a calling date. Accordingly, the

Appellant argued that when the Partition Act is silent on a matter of Law, the

provisions of the Civil Procedure Code shall be adopted, as per Section 79 of

the Partition Act (the Appel/ant's Counsel in his written submission mistakenly

has mentioned as Section 99). Therefore, Counsel for the Appellant argued

that the instant case will be treated under Section 87 of the Civil Procedure

Code, regarding the non-Appearance of Plaintiff (Appellant in this case).

It is surprisingly to note that, in this appeal the Appellant was not go in to deep

for establishing his version of evidence that which was led in the District Court

regarding his default. Rather he hasten to draw some arguments to show the

dismissal was unreasonable, therefore, the Appellant was constantly made

his submissions on Section 87(1) and 87(3) of the Civil Procedure Code.

In contrast, Counsel for the Respondents contended that the Appellant's

action was dismissed on 21.05.1999, not purely for his non-appearance, but

for his failure to prosecute the action with reasonable diligence, which was

manifest in his non-appearance, therefore, he argue that the Appellant's

action was dismissed under Section 70(1) of the Partition Law (as amended)

for non-prosecution and not under Section 87(1) of the Civil Procedure for

mere non-appearance (vide page 3 of the written submission on behalf the

Respondent). Accordingly, Counsel for the Respondents bring this Court's

attention that the order dated 03.06.1998 delivered by the learned District

Judge also demonstrate the failure on the part of the Appellant to prosecute

the action with reasonable diligence. Therefore, the following observations of

the District Court are noteworthy:

Therefore, in the above context the Respondents argue that the learned

Additional District Judge made the necessary directions requiring the

Appellant to take all the necessary steps to prosecute the action, finally, on

I I t I

J t j t I J , I i

12

14.08.1998 in order to compel the parties to bring the action to a termination

as the Appellant was not prosecuting the action with reasonable diligence

(paras 2 (d) & (e) of the Respondents' written submission).

At this stage I wish to point out some law-elements on non-prosecution of a

(partition) action. Section 70(1) of the Partition Law No. 21 of 1977 (as

amended) which provides as follows:

"No partition action shall abate by reason of the non-prosecution thereof,

but, if a partition action is not prosecuted with reasonable diligence after

the court has endeavoured to compel the parties to bring the action to a

termination, the court may dismiss the action;

Provided, however, that in a case where a plaintiff fails or neglects to

prosecute a partition action, the court may, by order, permit any

defendant to prosecute that action and may substitute him as a plaintiff

for the purpose and may make such order as to costs as the court may

deem fit."

It is to be observed that Section 70 quoted above, states on an empathetic

note, that no partition action shall abate by reason of non-prosecution of the

same and it imposes a duty on the Court to "compel the parties" to bring the

action to an end (vide, Peiris and Others vs Chandrasena and Others

(1999) 3 SLR 153, Amarasinghe vs Podimenike and Others 1997 1 SLR

349).

13

In Peiris and Others vs Chandrasena and others, this Court was held that,

"Section 70 (of the Partition Law) states that no partition action shall

abate by reason of non-prosecution, and it imposes a duty on the Court

to 'compel the parties' to bring the action to an end - which duty the

Court in this case has failed to fulfil. Where a delay in an action is the act

or omission of the Court, no party shall suffer for it. "

Also this court has endeavoured to set out some legal principles on the

word of "compel the parties" in the said Section.

In K. S. Victor vs. W. I. Tissera (CA 37412000)-(Court of Appeal minutes

dated 12.10.2015), A. H. M. D Nawaz, J has observed as follows:

"The pith and substance of promoting the spirit behind the Partition Law

lie in the District Judge's role in his/her endeavor to bring the parties to

trial and terminate proceedings as the final decree is dispositive of

parties' right against the whole world. Towards the end the grant of a

date even subject to costs is a course of action that cannot be

characterized as an erroneous exercise of discretion and one is

reminded of that perennial dictum-cost is a panacea for al/ ills ... " (page

at 14).

Also, I observe that the proviso to Section 70 of the Partition Law states that

in a case where a Plaintiff fails or neglects to prosecute a partition action, the

court may, by its order, permit any Defendant to prosecute that action and

may substitute him as a Plaintiff for the purpose and may make such order as

to costs as the court may deem fit. It is clear that the expression, "any

defendant" in the above Section 70(1) means, any defendant irrespective of

14

whether he has soil rights or not can prosecute the action thereunder; and

that Section 70 permits each single defendant, without distinction, to step in to

the shoes of the plaintiff, in case the plaintiff omits to do in the action that

which he ought to do or fails to prosecute the same with diligence. However, a

defendant's act (right) to step in to the shoes of the plaintiff is a voluntary one.

In the instant case, on the fateful day - when Appellant was absent and

unrepresented, any defendants (including Respondents) were not willing to

seek a permission to proceed the case; the Respondents eventually made an

application to dismiss the action - accordingly, the Appellant's action was

dismissed. Therefore, it is my view that in most of the case, the sanction of

the dismissal of action could be directly impact on plaintiff who failed to

(diligently) prosecute his/her case - same was happened in this case.

In the appeal, the Respondents' strong argument was that the learned

Additional District Judge by his order dated 03.06.1998 had directed the

Appellant to take all necessary steps to prosecute the action. Since the

Appellant failed to do so, therefore, on 14.08.1998 the Appellant's action was

dismissed for non-prosecution; however this (first time) dismissal of action

was later set aside consequent to an application made by the Appellant.

Later, on 21.05.1999 when the case was called in open Court, the Appellant

was absent and unrepresented, thus the learned Additional District Judge

(second time) dismissed the Appellant's action and entered a decree on

14.08.1998. At this juncture, I wish to recall the dictum of A. H. M. D Nawaz, J

- he observed that,

" ... Towards the end the grant of a date even subject to costs is a course

of action that cannot be characterized as an erroneous exercise of

discretion and one is reminded of that perennial dictum-cost is a

panacea for al/ ills ... " (Emphasized added).

J j I I j t i I

t

1

In the instant case, it is important to note that the learned Judge had

granted reasonable (period) dates to prosecute the case, even the

Appellant failed to do so.

15

Also, the Respondents submitted that, the Appellant's action was dismissed

on 21.05.1999, not purely for the Appellant's non-appearance, but for his

failure to prosecute the action with reasonable diligence therefore, they are in

position that the Appellant's action was dismissed on 21.05.1999 under

section 70(1) of the Partition Law and not under Section 87(1) of the Civil

Procedure Code for mere non-appearance (para 2 (j) of the written

submission). This court inclines to agree with these submissions.

The Appellant in his submission stated that the said fateful day namely

21.05.1999 is a calling date; and there is no provision in the Partition Act to

dismiss a case on a calling date. Accordingly, the Appellant submitted that

when the Partition Act is silent on a matter of Law, the provisions of the Civil

Procedure Code shall be adopted, as per Section 79 of the Partition Act.

Therefore, Counsel for the Appellant argued that the instant case will be

treated under Section 87 of the Civil Procedure Code, regarding the non-

Appearance of Plaintiff (Appellant in this case).

Section 79 of the Partition Law, 21 of 1977 (as amended) sets out the

following:

"In any matter or question of procedure not provided for in this Law, the

procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code in a like matter or

question shall be followed by the court, if such procedure is not

inconsistent with the provisions of this Law. "

Ii ;

I I 1

Now it is settled law that this casus omissus provision is has the effect

regard to the facts and circumstances of the case. The Section was

introduced for filling the lacunas in Partition Law.

16

Even, it is my view that the forgoing issue should be settled under Section

70(1) of the Partition Law; not under Section 87 of the Civil Procedure Code.

After careful perusal of the judgment of the learned Additional District Judge,

it is crystal clear that he dismissed the action not purely for the Appellant's

non-appearance, but for his failure to prosecute the action with due diligent.

The learned Additional District Judge reasonably compelled the Appellant

(Plaintiff) to prosecute the case which was filed around 1973; and he had

been enough lenient on the Appellant to before dismissing the action.

In the circumstances, I proceed to affirm the order of the learned Additional

District Judge and dismiss this appeal with Costs.

Appeal dismissed.
