ACHALA WENGAPPULI, I.

The Respondent-Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the

/I Appellant") invokes the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to set aside

the order of dismissal made by the Provincial High Court holden in

Kegalle on 19.11.2012, in respect of his revision application 4159 fRev.

With the filing of the said revision application, the Appellant sought

to set aside an order of demolition made by the Magistrate's Court of

Mawanella in case No. 24436 on 23.06.2011. The said order of demolition

was made by the Magistrate's Court consequent to an application of the

Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

"Respondent") under Section 28A(3) of the Urban Development Authority

Law No. 41 of 1978 as emended (hereinafter referred to as the UDA Law)

2

as the Appellant has failed to "cease development activity" within the time

. period specified in the said notice, addressed to the Appellant.

The Appellant appeared before the Magistrate's Court on summons

and tendered an affidavit by which he claimed that he has transferred

ownership of land to one Jayasinghe Arachchilage Monica Kumari on

18.05.2010. He admitted that he has commenced construction of a building

on the land. He further averred that the land was sold to him by the

Chairman of the Pradesheeya Sabha with the claim that no building plan is

needed for construction, who later changing his stance had instituted the

instant action.

Having considered the materIal placed before the Magistrate's

Court, it made order to demolish the unauthorised part of the said

construction. Thereafter, the Appellant moved in revision in the Provincial

High Court against the said order of demolition.

The Provincial High Court, in dismissing his application by its

order, has held that no exceptional circumstances or any illegality was

established by the Appellant.

Being aggrieved by the said order, the Appellant seeks to challenge

its validity on the following grounds;

1. The land on which the building to be demolished is not

situated in a "Urban Development Area",

ii. The Respondent is estopped in claiming the said building

required approved building plan,

3

111. Breach of rules of natural justice in relation to rights of third

parties.

In relation to his first ground of appeal, the Appellant relied upon

the Government Gazette No. 38/16 of 01.06.1979 by which the Urban

Development Areas were demarcated and identified. The Appellant

submits that the village of "Kappagoda" where the building is located, is not

included in the said Gazette or the Gazette No. 1070 of 05.03.1999 which

was published subsequently.

His second ground of appeal is based on the principle of estoppel.

According to the Appellant, the Respondent is the person who sold the

property to him with the assertion that no building plan is needed for

construction. However, in instituting action he has taken a totally a

contrary position by claiming that the Appellant has constructed a

building without an approved building plan. Therefore, the Appellant

claims that the Respondent is now estopped from claiming that a building

plan is needed.

The third ground of appeal is based on the rights of a third party

who has bought over the property from the Appellant, even before he

appeared in the Magistrate's Court and the order of demolition made

without the participation of the new owner clearly violates rules of natural

justice.

In the revision application of the Appellant, he sought to revise the

said order of demolition on the following grounds pleaded as exceptional;

4

a. the building under demolition order was constructed at an

enormous cost,

b. the construction work has commenced about a year ago,

c. there are other similar buildings in the area,

d. the Respondent was acting in mala fide in respect of this particular

building,

e. even if the new owner was disclosed, no action was taken,

f. failure to made them a party,

g. making an order in the absence of the new owner,

h. failure by the Magistrate's Court to consider these factors.

Upon perusal of the above li~t of "exceptional circumstances"

indicates that except for the third ground of appeal, the other two grounds

were not urged before the Provincial High Court by the Appellant.

In an appeal against the order of the Provincial High Court, this

Court would only consider what was placed before that Court for

determination by the parties. The Appellant is entitled to raise a pure

question of law in appeal for the first time. However, the challenge that the

village called" Kappagoda" is located outside the Urban Development Area

is not a pure question of law and therefore, the Appellant cannot raise it

before this Court for the first tin1e. The second ground of appeal also

belonged to the same category as it is an instance where the Chairman of

the Pradesheeya Sabha, in his private capacity was involved with the

transfer of title and only in his official capacity has instituted action under

UDA Law seeking demolition of unauthorised construction.

The Appellant cannot raise any new grounds in appeal, except for

the ones involving pure question of law for the first time in the Court of

Appeal as per the judgments of Gunawardene v Deraniyagala and Others

(2010) 1 Sri L.R. 309 and Simon Fernando v Bernadette Fernando (2003) 2

Sri L.R. 158.

The third ground of appeal of the Appellant that the Magistrate's

Court was in breach of rules of natural justice in relation to rights of third

parties was in fact pleaded before the Provincial High Court and therefore

could be re-agitated before this Court.

In relation to this ground of appeal, it appears that the Appellant, in

raising this issue, is under the notion that the liability in relation to

development activity conducted without a permit shifts with the transfer

of property rights to the person who succeeds in ownership of the building

and the land on which the said building is constructed.

Relevant provisions of the UDA Law do not support such a

proposition. Section 28A(1) empowers the Authority to require the

"person" who is executing or has executed such development activity to

comply with any of the courses of action specified in Section 28A(a) to (c).

A person would bring himself under the purview of UDA Law, if he has

" ... commenced continued, resumed or completed without permit or contrary to

any term or condition set out in a permit issued in respect of such development

activity .. . ", within an Urban Development Area, without approved

building plan or in violation of it.

Section 28A(2) imposes a statutory duty on the "person on whom a

notice is issued to comply with any requirement specified in such notice.

6

Section 28A(3) (a), in turn empowers the Authority to make an

application to the relevant Magistrate's Court for an order against such

"person" who failed to comply with the notice issued by the Authority to

authorise action under Section 28A(3)(a)(a)to (c). It must be noted here that

in all these statutory provisions, the "person" is clearly identified as the

person on whom a notice was issued by the Authority and has failed to

comply with it. This approach is further strengthened by the provisions of

Section 28A(6) where it is stated that lithe preceding provisions of this section

shall not affect any liability incurred by such person by reason of his failure to

comply 'with such notice." The liability of a third person arises if he brings

himself under the purview of UD~ Law, if he"" . continued, resumed or

completed without permit or contrary to any term or condition set out in a permit

issued in respect of such development activity ... ".

In relation to the instant appeal, the Authority has issued notice on

the Appellant on 06.05.2010. He has transferred the ownership to the

property to Jayasinghe Arachchilage Monica Kumari on 18.05.2010

presumably with the intention of escaping liability. In fact, she is the

daughter-in-law of the Appellant as per her statement to Mawanella Police

on 10.05.2011.

However, already the statutory duty, imposed under Section

28A(2)on the Appellant continues and thereby compels him to comply

with the notice issued by the Authority. In these circumstances, the

absence of any protection to a bona fide third-party purchaser of the

property or building in the UD A Law could be understood (except for

Section 2BA(6)), as relevant statutory provisions are clearly focused on the

person on whom a notice was issued by the Authority and has failed to

7

comply with it. In the given set of circumstances, the mere change of

ownership has no relevance in relation to proceedings under Section 28A.

The Provincial High Court, in its order also has considered this aspect on

similar lines.

It is noted by this Court that the Appellant made an attempt to

mislead the Provincial High Court with his assertion that it was the

present owner of the property (his daughter-in-law) who developed it by

constructing a "hotel" and she continued to operate it. This statement is

meant to shift liability of construction without a permit to the new owner

who is not a party to the case. Hdwever, the sketch attached to the

Respondent's application clearly indicates that the it was the Appellant

who commenced construction of this building. It is clearly shown in that

sketch that the rectangular building, built on a lO-perch block, which

consists of 12 concrete columns in three parallel rows. Therefore, the

Appellant is clearly the person who II commenced continued, resumed or

completed without permit or contrary to any term or condition set out in a permit

issued in respect of such development activity ... ", within an Urban

Development Area, without approved building plan or in violation of it.

This fact alone would have disentitled the Appellant to the

discretionary remedy sought from the Provincial High Court.

8

Accordingly, we hold thl.1t the ground of appeal urged before us by

the Appellant is devoid of any merit and therefore his appeal ought to be

disn1issed.

The appeal of the Appellant is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs.

25,000.00.
