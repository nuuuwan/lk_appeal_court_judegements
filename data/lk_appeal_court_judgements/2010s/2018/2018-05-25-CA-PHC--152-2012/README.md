This is an appeal preferred by the Plaintiff-Respondent-Appellant (Appellant) against the order of

the High Court of Kegalle dated 17th September 2012 by which the learned High Court Judge,

acting in revision, set aside the order of the learned Magistrate of Ruwanwella dated 15th

September 2010.

The case of the Appellant is that he was in possession of the premises in dispute when the

Respondent-Petitioner-Respondent (Respondent) forcibly dispossessed him on 29.08.2010. The

Appellant instituted proceedings in the Magistrates Court under section 66{1}{b) of the Primary

Court Procedure Act (Act) on 14.09.2010 and on 15.09.2010 obtained an interim order ex parte

allowing him to re-enter the premises in dispute after removing the padlock placed by the

Respondent. On 15.09.2010 notice was also issued on the Respondent. The fiscal executed the

interim order and reported to court on 23.09.2010. The Respondent appeared in court on

29.09.2010 and sought a date to file objections and was given time until 20.10.2010 to do so

which was later extended to 10.11.2010.

On 12.11.2010 the Respondent filed a revision application in the High Court of Kegalle and

obtained a stay order staying further proceedings in the Magistrates Court of Ruwanwella. The

learned High Court judge after hearing parties revised and set aside the order dated 15.09.2010

made by the learned Magistrate. Hence this appeal by the Appellant.

2

The only ground on which the learned High Court judge set side the order of Magistrate Court of

Ruwanwella was that the learned Magistrate had erred in issuing an interim order in terms of

section 67(3) of the Act after concluding that there was no threat or likelihood of a breach of

peace.

The order made by the learned Magistrate on 15.09.2010 is as follows:

It is clear on a plain reading that there is a clerical error in the order stating 1125)"l" when it was

clearly meant to be "Q"lII. That is the reason why the learned Magistrate went on to make an

interim order. He began by applying the correct test as when information is filed by a private

party under section 66(1)(b) of the Act it is incumbent upon the Primary Court judge to initially

satisfy himself as to whether there was a threat or likelihood of a breach of peace and whether

he was justified in assuming such special jurisdiction under the circumstances. 1

There is no specific provision in Part VII of the Act dealing with clerical mistakes or accidental slip

or omission. In these circumstances section 78 of the Act allows for the adoption of the provisions

in the Civil Procedure Code (Code) governing like matters. Section 189(1) of the Code provides

for the correction of any clerical or arithmetical mistake in any judgement or order or any error

arising therein from any accidental slip or omission.

1 Velupillai and others v. Sivanathan [(1993) 1 SrLL.R. 123 at, 126], Punchi Nona v. Padumasena and others [(1994) 2 SrLL.R. 117], Kanagasabai v. Mylvaganam (78 N.L.R. 280 at 283)

3

Hence undoubtedly, the Magistrates Court of Ruwanwella did have the power to correct the

clerical error in the order made on 15.09.2010 upon an application been made. 2lt is unfortunate

that no such application was made by the Appellant before the Magistrates Court of Ruwanwella.

That would have obviated the need for this matter to languish before two appellate courts for

over eight years.

In Gunasena v. Bandaratilleke3 Wijetunga J. held as follows:

"The authorities ... clearly indicate that a court has inherent power to repair an injury

caused to a party by its own mistake. Once it is recognized that a court would not allow a

party to suffer by reason of its own mistake, it must follow that corrective action should

be taken as expeditiously as possible, within the framework of the law, to remedy the

injury caused thereby. The modalities are best left to such court and would depend on

the nature of the error.// (emphasis added)

The question that engrossed my anxious consideration was whether the clerical error can be

corrected by another court at appeal or revision stage as in the instant case. I am reassured by

the following statement of H.N.G. Fernando S.P.J. in Moosajees Ltd. v. Fernando4 :

"This Court has also exercised an inherent power to correct error in a judgement which

has occurred per incuriam. I doubt whether this power is exercisable only by the Judge

who has pronounced the judgement; for if so, there would be no means of correcting

even a manifest clerical error discovered in the judgement after the death or retirement

of the Judge who pronounced it.//5(emphasis added)

2 Fernandopulle v. De Silva and others [(1996) 1 Sri.L.R.70J, Gunasena v. Bandaratilleke [(2000) 1 Sri.L.R. 292] 3lbid. 468 N.L.R. 414

5 Ibid. page 419

Furthermore, the word "court" in section 189(1) of the Code is defined in section 5 of the Code

to mean, "unless there is something in the subject or context repugnant thereto, a Judge

empowered by law to act judicially alone, or a body of Judges empowered by law to act judicially

as a body, when such Judge or body of Judges is acting judicially". I am of the view that in the

instant case, there is nothing in the subject or context repugnant to ascribing a judge exercising

revisionary or appellate jurisdiction to the word "court" where the impugned judgement or order

contains a clerical error. If not, a party may seek to obtain undue advantage from a clerical error

committed by court by impugning a judgement or order the very next day after it is delivered and

arguing that the original court cannot thereafter correct the clerical error in the judgement or

order. Accordingly, I am of the view that the learned High Court judge should have corrected the

obvious clerical error and erred in failing to do so.

There is a further reason as to why the High Court should not have exercised revisionary

jurisdiction against the interim order made by the Magistrate in terms of section 67(3) of the Act.

That interim order was made pending the conclusion of the inquiry. The Respondent had and

indeed was given the opportunity to file objections. Instead, the Respondent rushed to the High

Court to set aside the interim order made ex parte.

It is trite law that revisionary powers will not be exercised where the aggrieved party has another

remedy unless there are exceptional circumstances. 6ln the instant case the Respondent did not

establish any exceptional circumstances before the High Court. One ground urged by the

Respondent as forming exceptional circumstances, was that the interim order was made ex parte.

It is correct that the interim order was made by the learned Magistrate on the very date the plaint

was supported by the Appellant. However, as held in Muthukumarasamy v. Nannithamby7the

Magistrate/Primary Court has power even on the day information is filed to issue an interim

order. This was quoted with approval by the Supreme Court in Hotel Galaxy Ltd. v. Mercantile

Hotel Management Ltd. 8

The learned Counsel for the lA, lB, lC, lD and lE Substituted Respondent-Petitioner-

Respondents submitted that the order made by the learned Magistrate on 15.09.2010 is contrary

to section 66(6) of the Act which requires the Magistrate to, before fixing the case for inquiry,

make every effort to induce the parties to arrive at a settlement which is a fatal irregularity. In

Ali v. Abdeen9 U.de Z. Gunawardena J. held that the Primary Court was under a peremptory duty

to encourage or make every effort to facilitate dispute settlement before assuming jurisdiction

to hold an inquiry into a matter of possession and that making of such an endeavor by Court is a

condition precedent which had to be satisfied before the function of the Primary Court under

section 66(7) began to consider who had been in possession. I am in respectful agreement with

the views expressed therein. However, that duty cannot prevent the court making an interim

order under section 67(3) of the Act. Adopting the interpretation proposed by the learned

Counsel for the lA, lB, lC, lD and lE Substituted Respondent-Petitioner-Respondents will

negate the very purpose for which the power is given to the court under section 67(3) of the Act.

Furthermore, the Magistrate/Primary Court has power even on the day information is filed to

issue an interim order.i0

For the foregoing reasons, I set aside the judgement of the learned High Court Judge of Kegalle

dated 17th September 2012. I further direct the Magistrates Court of Ruwanwella to continue the

proceedings according to law from the point it was stayed by the High Court and conclude the

matter expeditiously.

The record does not indicate whether the possession of the disputed premises was handed back

to the Respondent as a result of the judgement of the learned High Court judge of Kegalle. It is

the duty of this court to restore possession of the disputed premises back to the Appellant if it

has been so handed over to the Respondent. Justice requires that the Appellant should be

restored to the position he occupied before the invalid order was made, for it is a rule that the

court will not permit a suitor to suffer by reason of a wrongful act. Actus curiae neminem gravabit

(An act of the court shall prejudice no man). Court will so far as possible put him in the same

position which he would have occupied if the wrong order had not been made.ll Accordingly, if

the possession of the disputed premises has been handed back to the Respondent as a result of

the judgement of the learned High Court judge of Kegalle, I direct the fiscal of High Court of

Kegalle to give possession of the disputed premises back to the Appellant. This direction will not

in any way prevent the learned Magistrate of Ruwanwella from making an appropriate order

according to law once proceedings recommence before him as directed by this court.

Appeal allowed. The Appellant is entitled to his costs both in the High Court as well as in this

court.
