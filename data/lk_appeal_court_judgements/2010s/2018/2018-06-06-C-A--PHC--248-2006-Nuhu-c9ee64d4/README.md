JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena J

Learned counsel for the 2nd Party - Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the Appellant) and the learned counsel for the 1st

Party - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

2nd Respondent), and the Intervenient Party - Respondent - Respondent

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 3rd Respondent),when this case

came up on 2017-07-11 before us, agreed to have this case disposed of,

by way of written submissions. Therefore, this judgment would be based

on the material so adduced.

Officer in charge of the Police Station Mawanella has referred the instant

dispute to the Primary Court of Kegalle in terms of Section 66 (1) (a) of the

Primary Court Procedure Act No 44 of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as the

Act). In the report filed by the Police, 1st Party - Petitioner - Appellant

(Mohomed Nuhuman Mohomed Aniz) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as

the Appellant) has been named as the 1st Party and the 2nd Party -

Petitioner - Respondent (Mohomed Hanifa Sahabdeen) (hereinafter

sometimes referred to as the 2nd Respondent) has been named as the 2nd

Party.

The Intervenient Party - Respondent - Respondent, (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as the 3rd Respondent), has also got himself added as a party

subsequently.

After the inquiry learned Primary Court Judge by his order dated 2004 -

07-21 had directed that the fence erected by the Appellant be removed.

Being aggrieved by the learned Magistrate's order the Appellant had filed a

revision application in the Provincial High Court of Sabaragamuwa Province

holden in Kegalle.

The Provincial High Court after hearing, by its judgment dated 2006-12-06,

had refused the said revision application on the basis that the findings by

the learned Primary Court Judge is correct.

It is against that judgment of the Provincial High Court that the Appellant

has appealed to this Court.

The Appellant has not controverted the fact that he had erected a fence to

separate the relevant washroom. He has also admitted that the said

washroom was constructed by the 2nd Respondent and it was the 2nd

Respondent who had been using it. The police observations have clearly

revealed that the impugned fence had been erected afresh. It was due to

6

the intervention of police that even a three feet wide access path had been

given to the 2nd Respondent to enable him to use the relevant washroom.

In the instant case, what the Provincial High Court was called upon to

exercise was its revisionary jurisdiction.

This Court observes that the written submission of the Appellant does not

set out any ground, which is at least suggestive of any illegality or any

impropriety of the impugned order. This Court also observes that the

procedure that has been followed by the learned Primary Court Judge is

not irregular. Therefore, it is clear that there had been no ground upon

which the Provincial High Court could have intervened to exercise its

revisionary jurisdiction, in this case.

Thus, the refusal of the Appelant's revision application by the learned

Provincial High Court Judge is inevitable.

In these circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that the learned

Primary Court Judge had correctly identified and applied the law to the set

of facts of this case. Thus, the learned Provincial high Court Judge has

correctly refused the revision application filed by the Appellant.

7

Hence, this Court decides to affirm both the judgment dated 2004-07-21 of

the Primary Court and the judgment dated 2006-12-06 of the Provincial

High Court and proceed to dismiss this appeal without costs.

Appeal dismissed without costs.
