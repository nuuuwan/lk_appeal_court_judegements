!\.H.M.D. Nawaz, J .

. [he Plaintiff instituted tl tis action against the Defend Int seeking to recover a sum of

Rs. 731,092.34 as damage} for an alleged breach of con'ract, together with legal mterest

thereon. The Defendant by his answer denied the chtim of the Plaintiff and made a

claim in reconvention in d sum of Rs. 6,691,247. 99 tog~ ther with legal interest f'1ereon.

rhe Defendant's Couns for this action was Mr. Gami 11. Senanayake, Attorney-at-Law

from Colombo. The said Counsel used to travel to G,tlle for this action and rEturn on

the same day. The usual practice was for the Defendant to transport the said Counsel

from Colombo to the Dis-:rict Court of Galle and after rhe case, back to Colombo on the

same day.

The trial in this action I ommenced with the recoding of admissions and is'mes on

10.02.2004. In all, 60 issu :5 were raised and accepted 1 'y the court. The Plaintifi raised

issues 1 to 22. The Def .l.dant thereafter raised issu';:'3 23 to 58. Finally, the Plaintiff

raised issues 59 to 60.

1

After the issues were raised, two of the issues raised by the Defendant were tried as

preliminary issues of law. Both parties tendered written submissions on those two

issues, and the Court delivered its order on 16.06.2004, answering both issues in favour

of the Plaintiff. Accordingly the trial was to proceed on the balance 58 issues.

When the action was ne::t called for further trial on 01.03.2005 the Defendant moved

for a postponement on the personal grounds of his Counsel and further trial was re-

fixed for 01.07.2005. On 01.07.2005 further trial was taken up and on that day the

plaintiff's evidence m chief was led, and thereafter the trial was adjourned for

11.11.2005.

It is brought to our notice that on 11.11.2005, the Uefendant and his Counsel left

Colombo for Galle at abo .1t 6.30 am by a vehicle in order to participate at the adjourned

trial in this action.

While they were so travelling, the Defendant's Counsel began to vomit and fell ill at

ease. The vehicle had to be halted at several places akmg the way, and after travelling

to Moratuwa, it was fOUlld that the said Counsel was not in a fit condition to proceed

to Galle. Accordingly, the Defendant then turned his vehicle in the opposite direction

back to Colombo, and took his Counsel for immediate medical attention to Nawaloka

Hospital, Colombo. In -the meantime, a friend of the said Counsel, Mr. Prasanna

Karunasekera, Attorney-at-law, was contacted over the telephone. He helped the

Defendant's Counsel to ,'onsult a doctor at the said Hospital, and thereafter to obtain

for the said counsel the drugs prescribed for him by the doctor.

The Defendant, who was accordingly in Colombo and was unable to travel to Galle, in

the meantime made every effort to contact Mr. Anthony Jayawardena, his registered

Attorney-at-Law in this ,etion in Galle, in order to apprise him of the situation, and to

inform him that the Defendant and his Counsel were unable to travel to Galle for this

action. All efforts of the Defendant to contact his registered Attorney-at-Law failed.

The Defendant thereaft~r came to know what had happened in this action on

11.11.2005. As the Defendant and his Counsel did .oot come to court, Ms. Nalani

2

Manatunga, an assistant Jf Mr. Anthony Jayawardena, who had no knowledge of what

had happened that morning and why the Defendant and his Counsel were absent,

moved for a postponement of the trial of this action, subject to costs to be fixed by

Court, on the ground that the Defendant was not ready for trial.

However, as the reason \ Thy the Defendant and his Counsel were not present in court

was not disclosed to Court, the learned President's Counsel appearing for the Plaintiff

objected to the application for a postponement. The objection was upheld and the

application for a postponement was refused on the basis that no acceptable reason was

divulged to Court as to why the Defendant was not ready for the case that morning.

We have been made aware of these facts through the petition, affidavits and other

material that have been f .led in this case.

Accordingly, further trial was taken up and concluded on 11.11.2005. The judgment in

the case goes as follows:-

"According to the evidence of the Plaintiff in this action, and the documents produced, it

appears that the Pia ntiff ought to be awarded reliefs as prayed for in the prayer to the

plaint. AccordinglYI 1 award the reliefs prayed for in paragraphs (a), (b) and (r) in the

plaint. I enter judgment in favour of the Plaintiff. Enter decree accordingly."

It is crystal clear that the said judgment does not comply with the mandatory

provisions of Section 18;; of the Civil Procedure Code', in that the judgment does not

contain a concise statem/~nt of the case, the points for determination, the decision on

each of the points for determination, or any reason for the decision of any of the points

for determination. It has not dealt with any of the 58 issues on which the trial

proceeded. It has neithel allowed nor disallowed the counter claim of the Defendant.

It is not a judgment witLin the meaning of the Civil Procedure Code-see the response

to these infirmities in cases such as Dona Lucihamy 11. Cicilyanahamy 59 N.L.R. 214;

Warnakula v. Ramani Jayawardena (1990) 2 Sri L.R. L06.

3

, Being aggrieved by the b3id judgment delivered on 11.11.2005, the Defendant filed a

notice of appeal dated 2:: .. 11.2005 against the same. vVe have been told that an appeal

was since filed and it is pending disposal.

Section 839 application

On 22.11.2005 the Defendant-Petitioner made an application by way of a petition and

an affidavit in the Distric Court of Galle under Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code,

praying inter alia that, in ,he exercise of the inherent pcwers of the Court in the interests

of justice and for the en.Js of justice, all proceeding~ dated 11.11.2005 and judgment

dated 11.11.2005 be vaca;ed and the action be fixed for further trial. The said petition,

dated 22.11.2005, is at pp.89-94 in "Z", and the said (iffidavit is at pp.95-99 in "Z". In

the said petition and al~ldavitthe Defendant-PetitiO!ter-Appellant averred the facts

mentioned above. To tht> said application was attach ~d an affidavit of Mr. Prasanna

Karunasekera (pp.167-168 in "Z"), and a medical certificate dated 11.11.2005 of the said

Counsel (p.267 in "Z"), as well as the receipt for d"ugs purchased on 11.1.2005 at

Nawaloka Hospital (p.2E 3 in "Z").

When the said application under Section 839 of the Civil Procedure Code was

supported in the District Court of Galle on 07.12.20Cn (pp.153-154 in "Z"), the Court

made order on the same day (p.155 in "Z") as follows:--

"While this is not an action tried ex parte, it was tried inter partes and judgment entered.

Further, a notice of 1ppeal has been filed against th? said judgment. The provisions of

section 839 can be n.ade use of only for the ends of jllstice or to prevent the abuse of the

process of the court. For the above reasons, while I hold that this application cannot be

instituted or main tamed, the application is rejected.' .

In my view, I would no. fault the learned District Judge for this conclusion. An inter

parte judgment had in fad been entered and a notice Clf appeal was subsequently filed

and thus the proceedings in the District Court were at an end and the remedy of the

Defendant lay either in the Court of Appeal or the rele'lant Civil Appellate High Court.

So the dismissal of the application under Section 839 was, in my view, properly made

4

and this leave to appeal application against that order, which has now ripened into this

appeal, would ordinarily have to be rejected. But upor the material filed in this appeal

against the order mad~' under Section 839, we have been made aware of the

circumstances in which t.1.e case against the Defendant-Petitioner-Appellant had been

concluded in the District Court of Galle. The Defendant's Counsel was on his way to

Galle from Colombo but he fell ill during the course of the journey. The affidavits filed

in the Section 839 application narrate the concatenation of events as to how the Counsel

and Defendant had bee!1 placed in an unfortunate and hapless situation. Upon a

disclosure of all these facts before us now in this appeal from a Section 839 order, and

having regard to the fact that the inter parte judgment entered by the learned District

Judge suffers from seri0us deficiencies as I have pointed out in the course of this

judgment, I take the view that this Court should exercise its powers of revision under

Article 139 of the Constitution to remedy the injustice that befell this hapless

Defendant. No doubt th,~ Defendant has preferred an appeal against the inter parte

judgment entered on 11 J 1.2005 and it is yet pending disposal, as notified to this Court.

Exercise of Revisionary Jurisdiction

But the circumstances in the case do shock the conscience of this Court so as to impel

us to exercise the revisionary jurisdiction of this Court and remand the main case to the

District Court of Galle fer a retrial. Our course of action is not without precedents. In

Attorney General v. Gut. awardena (1996) 2 Sri L.R. '1:19 an application in revision by

the Attorney General of an order made by the High Court of KandYI Samarawickrama,

A.C.J (with Rajaratnam,}. Wanasundera, J. Vythialingam, J. and Tittawela, J. agreeing)

declared that in exercising the powers of Revision the Court would not be trammelled

by technical rules of pIe; ding and procedure. In doir;g so the Court has power to act

whether it is set in motion by a party or not and even tX mero motu.

The Court adverted to th,~ often cited locus classicus on revision of Dias S.P.] in Attorney

General v. Podisingho 51 N.L.R. 385, where the learned Justice alluded to the ability of

Court to exercise revisioI, when a case comes "to the knowledge" of the Supreme Court

5

while an appeal is being lrgued as in Soysa v. Punchif"ala (1995) 1 S.C.R 199 and Clara

v. Pedrick (1900) 1 Brown at p.215.

We are accordingly of thE.' view that this Court possesses the power to act in revision in

this matter. There is SUcll clear and manifest error and material irregularity as would

call for the intervention )f this Court to redress or relnedy an inequitable exercise of

original jurisdiction and L thus proceed to set aside th(~ judgment dated 11.11.2005 and

direct the learned Distri.:t Judge of Galle to comme,lce a trial de novo on the same

pleadings and conclude -. his case as expeditiously as possible.

It has been brought to our notice that the Defendant Ius already filed a final appeal in

regard to this mater and the Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant states that they

would not proceed with j~he final appeal that had betn filed in regard to this matter,

now that this Court has {'xercised its revisionary jurisdiction.

E.A.G.R. Amarasekara, 1 I agree.
