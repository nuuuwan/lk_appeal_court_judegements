The Accused Appellant (hereinafter sOlnetimes referred to as the Appellant), was

indicted in the High Court of Colombo on 22106/2004, for committing the

following offences;

(1) On or about 07/01/2003, at Forbes Lane, did posses 6.4 grams of Diacetyl

Morphine (heroin), an offence punishable under Section 54 (A) (d) of

Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act No. 13 of 1984 (as amended).

(2) In the course of the same transaction trafficked in 6.4 grams of Diacetyl

Morphine (heroin), an offence punishable under Section 54 (A) (b) of

Poison, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Act No. 13 of 1984 (as amended).

3

At the conclusion of the trial, by Judgment dated 21/08/2009, the Appellant was

convicted of both charges and sentenced to life itnprisonment. The Appellant

being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, preferred this appeal to this

Court.

The facts briefly are as follows;

On 07/01/2003, Inspector of Police IP Rangajeewa, attached to the Police Narcotic

Bureau (PNB), received an infonnation around 11.00 AM, that a female was in

possession of heroin. Acting on the said information at around 11.30 AM, IP

Rangajeewa together with a team of 7 Officers had proceeded to the vicinity of

Gamini Hall Maradana, and met the said informant. After a discussion with the

informant, IP Rangajeewa and Sub Inspector (SI) Gunasekara, had proceeded

about 200 metres along Forbes Lane and taken up position close to Mirismola

Watta. About 30 minutes later, with the assistance of the informant, the Appellant

was identified walking towards the Mirismola Watta from Maradana road,

carrying a bag. Having arrested the Appellant a search was carried out and the

raiding party had discovered heroin wrapped in a green cellophen bag, which was

in the possession of the Appellant. Thereafter a search was carried on at the

Appellant's house at No 163/22, Devanampiyatissa Mawatha, Forbes Lane,

however, no unauthorized substance was recovered.

The heroin recovered froin the possession of the Appellant had been sealed in an

envelope and sent to the Government Analyst who reported that the substance

4

analyzed contained 6.4 grains of heroin. At the trial, the prosecution led the

evidence of IP Rangajeewa and SI Gunasekara and the evidence of the

Government Analyst. At the conclusion of the evidence of the said witnesses, the

trial Judge, taking into consideration an admission of the authenticity of the

inwards and outwards journey of the productions forwarded to the Government

Analyst, by the parties in terms of Section 420 of the Code of Criminal Procedure

Act (CCPA), accepted the facts contained therein as proved.

After the closure of the prosecution case the Appellant, initially gave evidence on

oath, however later opted to make a dock statement. In the dock statement the

Appellant states that, she was arrested at her house by the officers and denies any

involvement with possession of heroin.

Both parties filed written submissions prior to the argument and the following

grounds of appeal were raised on behalf of the Appellant.

1. Failure to attach any significance to the inwards and outwards journey of

the productions under Section 420 of the CCPA, relating to the Government

Analyst Report (GAR), confinning such productions as heroin seized from

the Accused.

2. Erroneous approach of the Hon. High Court Judge in the evaluation of the

defence, tantamounts to shifting of the burden of proof.

3. Infirmity arising on record whether the Accused gave evidence on oath or

made a dock statement, as it affects the burden of proof.

5

The Appellant calls into question the purported lapses on the part of the

prosecution for the failure to call material witnesses who could have confirmed the

inwards journey and the safe custody of the productions sent to the Government

Analyst Department (GAD), pointing out that,

SI Jayamanna, who handed over the productions to the (GAD) and the

Government Analyst eGA), Chandrani who received the productions, were

not called as witnesses by the prosecution.

Productions handed over to GA Chandrani was from the PNB and not from

the Maligakanda Magistrates Courts.

When the trial re-commenced on 20/11/2008, the prosecuting counsel has

amended the list of witnesses and included Kanapathipillai Sivarasa as Prosecution

Witness 9, in place of the listed officer. In his evidence at page 167-168, the said

witness states that GA Chandrani had accepted the productions and handed over

the said productions to Assistant Government Analyst Navaratne. The witness has

identified the signature of SI J ayamanna on the cover of the productions and also

has observed that the seals contained were intact. At page 162 this witness clearly

states that the productions handed over to the GAD were received from the PNB.

It is observed that due to a typographical error it has been stated that the

productions were handed over to the GAD from the Maligakanda Magistrate's

Court. The fact that the productions were handed over to the GAD by the PNB

6

vvas confirmed by a file copy which was in the custody of the witness, Inarked and

produced as Y.

At the conclusion of the evidence of the said witness the prosecution has moved to

call Witness No. 11, IP Jayamanna. Thereafter, further application is made by the

prosecution, subject to the agreelnent of the defence, that the Court consider the

inwards journey of the productions to the Government Analyst Department in

terms of Section 420 of the CCPA. By order dated 16102/2009, the Court having

considered the admission of the inwards journey by the defence, accepted the said

evidence in terms of Section 420 of the CCP A. Thereafter, by order dated

27/02/2009, the Court upheld that the application made by the prosecution that the

inwards journey of the productions from the PNB to the Government Analyst

Department and the outwards journey to the relevant Court is an admitted fact in

terms of Section 420 of the CCP A.

Section 420 (2), of the CCP A reads as follows;

"ft shall not be necessary in any summary prosecution or trial on

indictment for either party to lead proof of any fact which is admitted by the

opposite party or to prove any documents the authenticity and terms of

which are not in dispute and copies of any documents may by agreement of

the parties be accepted as equivalent to the originals.

Such admissions may be made before or during the trial.

7

Such admissions shall be sufficient proof of the fact or facts admitted

without other evidence: Provided however that this section shall not apply

unless the accused person was represented by an Attorney-at-Law at the

time the admission was made:

Provided further that ... .. , ... "

In this case the Appellant was represented by counsel and the said admissions

were recorded during the trial. Therefore, the exceptions contemplated in Section

420 of the CCP A, will not apply. The Appellant did not object to the admissions

recorded in terms of the said Section. Accordingly, admissions agreed by the

parties would be sufficient proof of the facts admitted, without calling for further

evidence. The Court is mindful that there are numerous judicial decisions stressing

the importance of the inwards journey of productions to the Government Analyst

Department. The purpose of recording an admission is to dispense with the burden

of proving any fact or to prove the authenticity of any document at the trial. As

noted earlier the Hon. Trial Judge, in his order dated 27/02/2009, has stated that

the said order is made with the agreement of the defence. GA Sivarasa was cross

examined by the defence on the issue of safe custody, when handing over the

productions to GA Chandrani by IP Jayatnanna. GA Sivarasa has confirmed that

the seals placed on the productions were intact at the time the productions were

handed over to GA Chandrani. The defence has not suggested any counter stand to

this witness on the receipt of the said productions by GA Chandrani. Therefore, it

8

is safe to conclude that the trial Judge has not been misdirected in recording the

admission of the inwards journey in accepting the evidence relating to the

Governlnent Analyst Report, for the reasons stated in his Judgment.

In the case of Perera Vs. Attorney General (1998) 1 SLR 378, the Court looked

into a similar question arising out of the inwards journey and the custody of

productions when the defence had adlnitted the correctness of the procedure in

terms of Section 420 of the CCPA, where the Court stated on page 381, that;

"The learned trial Judge had approached the question raised by the

counsel for the appellant in the light of the above admissions recorded by

court. The learned trial Judge had stated that since the defendant had

admitted the correctness of the procedure adopted by the prosecution in

sending the production to the Analyst Department} the defendant is

estopped from contesting the validity or the correctness of the analyst

report even if the prosecution had not led in evidence the receipt of

acceptance of the productions by the Analyst Department. Furthermore the

defence had suggested not to call the analyst. In these circumstances

defendant should not be permitted to take advantage of his own conduct

and complain that the report of the Analyst is defective or inaccurate. We

are in agreement with these observations of the learned trial Judge. "

The learned trial Judge has considered the accuracy of the inwards journey of the

productions to GA Chandrani, when deciding to admit the Government Analyst

9

Report. The acceptance of the productions by the GAD is confinned by the file

copy Inarked Y. Therefore, there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of the

procedure adopted by the prosecution and to interfere with the findings of the trial

Judge with regard to the admission of the inwards journey and the safe custody of

the productions.

Question No.2 is on the erroneous approach in the evaluation of the defence.

In her Dock Statement, the Appellant takes up the position that she was arrested at

her house. Her stand was that the police officers came in search of her husband

and failing to arrest him had taken her into custody. When her brother in law had

intervened, the officers had assaulted him. The trial Judge when evaluating the

admissibility of the Dock Statement has taken into consideration the presence of

her husband and her brother in law, at the time of her arrest, to put into context the

prosecution case, that the arrest of the Appellant was made elsewhere. Therefore,

vve see no error in the said evaluation of admissibility of the Dock Statement.

Question No. 3 is regarding the discrepancy/ infirmity in the nature of the

evidence of the accused.

At the conclusion of the prosecution case the Appellant opted to give evidence on

oath. However, during evidence in chief of the Appellant, the prosecution objected

to adducing evidence of an alibi in support of the defence, without prior notice in

tenns of Section 126A (1) of the CCP A. i\t this stage the defence moved for time

to consider and when the trial resumed on the next date, ie. 28/05/2009~ (page

.. .

10

178), the Appellant opted to make a Dock Statement. (51556325)86(.5 -e5::lzs)@ ~~@eJ

The case record bears testilnony to what transpired in open court on 28/05/2009

and to the Inethod of defence the Appellant sought to proceed with, clearly rules

out any discrepancy or infirmity of procedure.

In view of the above reasons, we see no basis to interfere with, the Judgment made

by the learned High Court Judge. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal and affirm

the conviction and sentence.

Appeal dismissed.
