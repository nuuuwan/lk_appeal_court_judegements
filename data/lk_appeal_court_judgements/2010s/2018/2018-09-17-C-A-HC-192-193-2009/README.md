Accused - Appellant.

AR.H. 8ary sse for the AG.

: 03rd September, 2018

: 14th September, 2018

The appellant together with four others were indicted in the High

Court of Pana9ura for committing an offence punishable under section 2

(4) of the Convention Against Torture Act no. 22 of 1994 read with section

32 of the Penal Code. After trial the appellant was convicted for

committing torture and was sentenced to 2 years RI suspended for 10

years. He was also ordered to pay Rs. 100,0001= as compensation to the

victim carrying a default term of 2 years.

The appellant has filed the instant application against the said

conviction and the leurned Attorney General has filed another application

2

to enhance the sentence imposed 8gainst the appellant. Both appeals

were taken up for argument together.

The appellant with four others has gone to the house of one

Piyadasa the father of prosecution witness no. 2 to inquire into a

complaint made against them regarding an incident where the witness

number 2 and his father is alleged to have abused a . staff assistant at the

Diamond Jubilee College. According to prosecution witness no. 1 and his

sister's evidence out of the 5 who came in search of their fqther only one

was in police uniform. Milant~a (prosecution witness 1) has stated that

the police officers who came to their house assaulted him and his father

while they were taking them to the school premises. At the school

premises his father and Milantha were asked to worship a peon and was

then asked to crawl on their knees to the road which was about 100

meters away. After that they were taken to the police station and

assaulted again. He does not say who assaulted them at the police

station. After keeping them in the police station for over one day they

were produced before the DMO. The DMO has stated the victim had

simple abrasions on the left knee and contusions on the left elbow. The

consultant Judicial Medical Officer who examined them later after 11 days

have not given an opinion on how the injuries would have been caused.

< , "~'~. -' ".-' . . "' .. '_ .. ,:.'-

~ .. ' , ___ "'h'/' .~ .-:

None of the witness have set;n the appellant prior to this incident

and he was identified by the witness from the dock. These two witnesses

who are family members of Piyadasa are interested witnesses. Therefore

their evidence has to be considered with utmost caution.

The main witness in this case is prosecution witness no. 2 Milantha

his evidence on the incident does not corroborate other evidence.

Prosecution witness number two's evidence can be taken into account if

his evidence corroborates with the medical evidence. Med;ical evidence-

does not corroborate assault..The doctor who examined them first was

told by the witness that they had a fall.

There is no evidence to say that the others acted on the instructions

of the appellant. No identification parade was held for the witnesses to

identify the appellant. All the witnesses have said that they saw the

appellant for the first time when he came to this house in search of

Piyadasa.

The learned counsel for the appellant argued since there was no

identification parade and the witness did not know the accused only one

accused could not have been convicted. He cited the judgments in

4

Kuruppiah servai vs The King 52 NLR 227, Kirihamulage Nihal vs

AG.

The appellant's counsel stated that the prosecution witnesses

three, four, five's evidence should have been considered with caution by

the learned High Court Judge since they were seated inside the court

house when prosecution witness number two was giving evidence (p

152),

The learned counsel for the respondent argued that the question

of identity does not arise since this was not a spur of the moment incident

and that the persons who went to Piyadasa's house were in civil and one

was in uniform and that they were identified by the witness as police

officers.

Since there is an appeal by the state also against the instant

judgment the learned counsel stated that there is a mandatory sentence

for the said offence therefore the sentence given to the appellant should

be enhanced.

5

On the question of mandatory sentence I refer to the judgment of

Her Ladyship Justice Wanasundera in Ambagala Mudiyanselage

Samantha Sampath vs AG S.C. No. 17/2013 delivered on 12/03/2015

where it was held "sentencing is the most important part of a criminal case

and I find that provision in any law with a minimum mandatory sentence goes

against the judicial discretion to be exercised by the judgeJ~

It was also held in this case that;

"In these circumstances I hold that the Learned High Court Judge

had correctly imposeil a, suspended sentence of "2 years RI.

Suspendedfor 10 years". I agree with the decision of the Supreme

Court in S.c. Reference 03/2008 and uphold the conclusion of that

case that the minimum mandatory sentence in Section 364 (2) (e)

is in conflict with Articles 4 (c), 11 and 12 (1) of the Constitution

and that the High Court is not inhibited from imposing a sentence

that it deems appropriate in the exercise of its judicial discretion

notwithstanding the minimum mandatory sentence.

Therefore the minimum mandatory sentence no longer applies to

this case.

6

In the instant case the learned High Court Judge has accepted the

evidence of the prosecution witnesses regarding the first accused in the

same incident and rejected the same evidence with regard to the other

accused. Learned High Court Judge has merely convicted the appellant

without considering at whnt point the actual torture took place, and

without specifically stating for which incident the appellant is convicted.

The medical evidence produced by the prosecution is not

convincing, the victim was produced at the Kalubowrla ho~pital 11 days

after the incident. He was treated by another doctor soon after the alleged

incident where he has stated there were 2 injuries which are 2 abrasions

on the left and right knees.

The learned High Court Judge has failed to consider the

identification of the accused when the witnesses have stated that the

accused were previously not known to them. As stated in Kuruppiah's

case when there is more than one accused there should be enough

evidence to eXCUlpate the only accused being convicted.

7

For the afore stated reasons we decide that the judgment of the

learned High Court Judge should be set aside. We allow the appeal of

the accused appellant and dismiss the appeal filed by the Hon. Attorney

General.

Judgment dated 03/07/2009 is set aside.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL

Achala Wengappuli J.

I agree.
