Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action. The 11th defendant-appellant has filed

this appeal against the Judgment of the learned Additional

District Judge of Pugoda dated 27.10.2000.

The 11th defendant has filed a joint statement of claim together

with the 1st and 2nd defendants claiming her undivided rights to

the land to be partitioned.1

There is one plaintiff and 13 defendants in the case. The case

has been taken up for trial on 22.03.2000. According to the

proceedings on that day, except the 2nd and 3rd defendants, all

the other parties including the plaintiff had been absent; and

only the registered Attorneys for the plaintiff and the 3rd

defendant had been present. Thereafter, the Court has recorded

that: It is informed that there is a settlement among the plaintiff,

and the 2nd and 3rd defendants. Hence necessity does not arise

to raise issues. The 2nd defendant is called to give evidence.2

The evidence of the 2nd defendant has then been led and closed

the case for the plaintiff reading in evidence documents marked

P1-P3 only.3 It is clear from the last page of the proceedings on

that day4 that the evidence of the 2nd defendant had been led by

the registered Attorney of the plaintiff (as the registered Attorney

for the 3rd defendant has purportedly cross examined the 2nd

defendant).

This in my view is unwarranted. It is significant to note that the

2nd defendant appeared in person on that day without his

registered Attorney. The registered Attorney for the plaintiff

ought not to have done it without the permission of the

registered Attorney for the 2nd defendant. It is trite law that

until the proxy is revoked with the leave of Court, a party cannot

appear in person and make applications to Court. All the acts

relating to the case shall necessarily be done through the

registered Attorney or a counsel on the instructions of the

registered Attorney.

It is perplexing to note that at the end of the evidence in chief of

the 2nd defendant (led by the registered Attorney of the plaintiff),

the 2nd defendant has stated that the shares shall be allocated

not in accordance with the plaint, but in accordance with the List

of Shares to be tendered in future. That is a clear indication

that the purported settlement was undecided at the time of

leading evidence. Even if it was decided, this course of action is

not permitted in law.

It is the duty of the learned District Judge to calculate the

shares according to the evidence led before him. He cannot

delegate that duty, which is judicial, to a party or his Attorney.

If an Attorney tenders a List of Shares to assist Court, he shall

do so with notice to the other parties and then the learned

District Judge can consider it when calculating shares on his

own. Such a List of Shares shall be a part of the Judgement

and not something which shall be prepared after the

pronouncement of the Judgment. (Thomas Singho v. Cornelis5,

Ariyasena v. Alen6)

Thereafter, on 08.06.2000, the registered Attorney for the

plaintiff has tendered a List of Shares only with notice to the

registered Attorney for the 3rd defendant.7 No copy of this List of

Shares had been sent to the registered Attorney for the 2nd

defendant or at least to the 2nd defendant who undertook in his

evidence to tender the List of Shares.

It may be recalled that the plaintiffs case was closed reading in

evidence only P1-P3. Thereafter, from time to time, several

Deeds have been tendered to Court.8

The Court has pronounced the Judgment on 27.10.2000.9 In

that Judgment the 11th defendant-appellant has not been given

any shares.

In the Judgment the learned Additional District Judge has

specifically stated that the 2nd defendant did not give clear

evidence as to how the parties become entitled to undivided

shares in the land on Deeds and by inheritance.10

The 11th defendant has filed a Notice of Appeal against the said

Judgment on 09.11.2000.11

Thereafter, having revoked the earlier proxy, the new proxy of

the 2nd defendant has been tendered by the registered Attorney

for the 3rd defendant.

The new registered Attorney for the 2nd defendant by way of a

petition and affidavit dated 29.11.2000 has made an application

inter alia to mark the Deeds which the 2nd defendant relies on to

claim undivided rights in the corpus.12

Thereafter the 2nd defendants evidence has again been led to

mark his (the 2nd defendants) Deeds and to introduce some new

evidence regarding devolution of title of others.13

This itself goes to show that the 2nd defendant has been

misguided to give evidence at the trial (in the absence of his

Attorney-at-Law). If he knew what he was doing, he would have

marked his Deeds first before marking others Deeds.

As I stated earlier, the 1st, 2nd and 11th defendants have filed a

joint statement of claim. Three Deeds including the 11th

defendant-appellants Deed have specifically been pleaded in the

said statement of claim. The 2nd defendant did not mark any of

those three Deeds which he has referred to in his statement of

claim. If the 2nd defendant knew what he was doing, there was

no reason for him not to refer to the 11th defendants Deed and

mark it in evidence.

It is also relevant to note that, in his evidence given for the

second time, referring to the evidence given earlier, the 2nd

defendant has stated that On that occasion, there was a lawyer

appeared on my behalf14, which is wrong.

After leading the evidence of the 2nd defendant for the second

time, an amended Judgment has been pronounced on

11.12.2000.15

It is abundantly clear that no proper investigation of title has

been made by the learned Additional District Judge before

pronouncing the Judgment(s). Evidence has not been led in a

manner that should have been led in a partition action.

The paramount duty of the District Judge trying a partition

action is to investigate the title of each party quite independently

of what the parities may or may not tell the Court.16 It is

important to understand that this is different from the role a

Judge plays in an adversarial system where he has no power to

go beyond what has been placed before him by the two adverse

parties and decide the matter on what he thinks is right or

righteous. But a partition action is an action in rem (as opposed

to an action in personam), the Judgment of which is bound not

only by the parties to the case, but also by others who are not

parties to the case.

The learned Additional District Judge, in my view, should not

have allowed the evidence of the 2nd defendant to be led in the

absence of his Attorney on the purported basis that there was a

settlement among the plaintiff and the 2nd and 3rd defendants.

On the other hand, even if the Attorney of the 2nd defendant was

there, unless all the other parties were present or represented by

16 Vide section 25 of the Partition Law, No. 21 of 1977 as amended. Peris v.

their Attorneys and consented to the settlement, it is elementary

that the learned Additional District Judge could not have

proceeded to record the evidence of the 2nd defendant as if it was

an overall settlement bound by all the parties to the case. Such

a settlement is obnoxious to section 408 of the Civil Procedure

Code and liable to be quashed as a nullity for the Court has no

jurisdiction to do so.

I must state that there is no blanket prohibition against entering

settlements in partition action. Nevertheless, that can only be

allowed by Court after investigating the title and having satisfied

that the parties before it alone have interests in the land to be

partitioned. (Kumarihamy v. Weeragama17, Faleel v. Argeen18,

Caroline Perera v. Martin Perera19) There cannot be any dispute

that the learned Additional District Judge in the instant case

failed to address any of those matters.

At the argument before this Court, except the 11th defendant-

appellant, only the 3rd defendant-respondent was represented by

a counsel. The learned counsel for the 3rd defendant-respondent

in his written submissions admits the claim of the 11th

defendant-appellant but says that the said portion shall be

taken or deducted from the portion given to the 4th defendant as

the 4th defendant has been given more than what was due by

Deeds and inheritance. The 4th defendant is the mother of the

plaintiff and upon the death of the former, which happened well

before the purported settlement, the plaintiff has been

substituted in the place of the 4th defendant.20

It may be recalled that the settlement was in fact between the

plaintiff and the 3rd defendant (even though the 2nd defendant

was used as a cats paw). Now the 3rd defendant himself

(indirectly) admits that the settlement was a hoax!

I set aside all the proceedings after the 22.03.2000, including

the Judgment and the Amended Judgment, and direct the

learned District Judge to conduct the trial afresh and take follow

up steps according to law.

The 3rd defendant shall pay a sum of Rs. 50,000/= as costs of

the appeal to the 11th defendant-appellant.

Appeal allowed. Retrial ordered.
