The accused appellant was indicted in the High Court of Badulla

for the murder of Puarumbu Meenachchi under section 296 of the Penal

Code and also under section 380 for robbery and under section 315 of

the Penal Code for causing hurt to Periyasamypulle Pushparajah. After

conviction he was convicted on all 3 charges and sentenced to death.

According to the case for the prosecution the appellant who is a

nephew of the deceased has come to the deceased's house around 4.30

I 1 in the evening. on 07103/2001. He has borrowed a sarong from , prosecution witness number one, Pushparajah and they have watched

, television till 1 ;00 a.m. and gone to sleep. While sleeping prosecution

witness number one had felt a blow on his head and had woken up to

hear his wife shouting and then he has fallen unconscious. Around 7 a.m.

on the following day he has gained consciousness and seen his wife

fallen on the floor from the bed in a pool of blood. He had noticed that the

'Thaii' and another necklaces she was wearing was missing. He has

breaking the doors. In his evidence the police officer too has stated that

no outsiders could enter the house when the doors are locked. Only the

deceased, witness number one and the appellant have been in the house

on that night.

S.1. Priyadharshana in his evidence has stated that after recording

a statements of one Ratna Indrakumara on 08/03/2001 he has visited the

scene of the crime and has viewed the body of the deceased and

recovered a knife from the scene of the crime and has noticed two

stainless steel bowls with blood on them and has summoned an officer

from the Registrar of Finger Prints. They have observed a number of

fingerprints and the expert witness has testified that one finger print had

matched the appellant's finger prints.

The investigating officers have arrested the appellant on

12/03/2001 at Kotchchikade, Negombo. Consequent to a statement

made by the appellant under Section 27 (1) of the Evidence Ordinance

police have recovered the jewellery from the Hatton National Bank where

he has pawned them. Prosecution Witness number 4 an officer from the

said bank had testified that the said jewellery was pawned after

submitting the National Identity Card bearing the number 750291708V

which is the appellant's National Identity Card Number.

. .;.-......... ,'

An officer from the National Identity Card Office has testified that

the said National Identity Card bearing no. 750291708V was issued to

the appellant. The jewellery recovered by the police was shown to

Pushparaja and he has identified them as the necklaces worn by his wife.

The appellant in his Dock statement has stated that he borrowed

the jewellery. In his Dock statement he has not denied that the jewellery

was pawned at the Hatton National Bank and how his National Identity

Card was given to pawn the jewellery to the Hatton National Bank Officer.

He does not explain why he left the deceased's house without telling

them.

The points of argument of the learned counsel for appellant was

that the learned High Court Judge has misdirected herself but did not say

on what. He also said that the Bank Officer did not identify the appellant

in court, this is not required as his National Identity Card was proved by

the prosecution. He also stated that out of four finger prints only one

matched with that of the appellant. This is more than enough to establish

that the appellant was present at the scene of the crime. Moreover in his

Dock statement he admits the fact that he came to the deceased's house

on the day in question. The last ground of argument was that the learned

High Court Judge has not considered the Dock statement made by the

accused. We find that the learned High Court Judge has analysed the

Dock statement and has stated that the Dock statement does not create

a doubt on the prosecution case.

In Nissanka vs The State 3 SLR (2001) p.75 it was held;

liThe attendant circumstances of this case S. 27 statements,

consequent to which productions were discovered not only

embrace the knowledge of the first accused and accused

appellant as to these items, being hidden in the places from

which they were detected but that it was evidence

connecting them with the murder. I

For the afore stated reasons we decide to affirm the judgment

dated 06/12/2011. The judgment and conviction affirmed.

Appeal is dismissed.

L.U. Jayasuriya J.

I agree.
