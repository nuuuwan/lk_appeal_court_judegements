ORDER

P Padman Surasena J (PICA)

The Petitioner has filed this application seeking an injunction in terms of

Article 143 of the Constitution.

Article 143 of the Constitution states as follows;

"The Court of Appeal shall have the power to grant and issue injunctions to

prevent any irremediable mischief which might ensue before a party

I

4

making an application for such injunction could prevent the same by

bringing an action in any Court of First Instance:

Provided that it shall not be lawful for the Court of Appeal to grant an

injunction to prevent a party to any action in any Court from appealing to

or prosecuting an appeal to the Court of Appeal or to prevent any party to

any action in any Court from instituting upon any ground of action, defence

or appeal or to prevent any person from suing or prosecuting in any Court,

except where such person has instituted two separate actions in two

different Courts for and in respect of the same cause of action, in which

case the Court of Appeal shall have the power to intervene by restraining

him from prosecuting one or other such actions as to it may seem fit."

It is to be noted that the Petitioner has admitted1 that there is a specific

statutory bar in terms of section 56 of the Debt Conciliation Boards

Ordinance as amended, which prevents the Petitioner from bringing in an

action in the civil Court (District Court) against the 1st and 2nd Respondents

in the instant case.

1 Paragraph 27 of the petition.

5

It is the view of this Court that this Court can invoke the power vested in it

by virtue of Article 143 of the Constitution only to prevent any irremediable

mischief before a party making an application for such injunction could

prevent the same by bringing an action in any Court of First Instance.

Section 2 of the Judicature Act states that the Courts of First Instance for

the administration of justice in the Republic of Sri Lanka shall be -

(a) the High Court of the Republic of Sri Lanka;

(b) the District Courts;

(c) the Family Courts;

(d) the Magistrates' Courts;

(e) the Primary Courts.

Therefore, this Court is of the view that the Debt Conciliation Board

established in terms of provisions of the Debt Conciliation Boards

Ordinance as amended, does not fall under the category of Courts of First

Instance within the meaning or for purposes of Article 143 of the

Constitution.

6

In these circumstances, the prayer for an injunction 'until the application

No. 44034 the Debt Conciliation Board is disposed of' in the instant

application is a prayer, which this Court cannot grant in terms of Article

143 of the Constitution.

In these circumstances, this Court decides to refuse and dismiss this

Application without costs.
