JUDGMENT

P Pad man Surasena J

The Applicant - Respondent - Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred

to as the 1st Respondent) had issued a quit notice on a person named U R

A Rajapaksha, in terms of section 3 of the State Lands (Recovery of

Possession) Act (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the Act).

As the said person had failed to respond to the said quit notice, the 1st

Respondent had thereafter made an application under section 5 of the Act

to the Magistrate's Court of Dambulla seeking an order to evict the said U

R A Rajapaksha from the land described in the schedule to the said

a ppl ication.

Learned Magistrate by the order dated 2014-06-04 directed that the said

person be evicted from the said land as he had failed to appear in Court.

The present Petitioner who is not the person to be evicted had filed a

revision application in the Provincial High Court of Central Province holden

in Kandy seeking a revision of the order of the learned Magistrate.

5

The Provincial High Court after the conclusion of the argument, had

pronounced its judgment dated 2016 -02-11, holding that the rights of the

Petitioner have not been violated.

It is that order that the Petitioner is canvassing in this application before

this Court.

Admittedly, the Petitioner was not a party to the proceedings before the

Magistrate's Court. 1 Further, he has also admitted that the relevant land is

a land belonging to the Urban Development Authority.2

It is the observation of this Court that the Petitioner has failed to establish

that he has any locus standi to file this application for revision. Therefore,

he is not entitled to maintain the instant application.

Section 9 of the Act states as follows.

" ... At such inquiry the person on whom summons under section 6 has

been served shall not be entitled to contest any of the matters stated in

the application under section 5 except that such person may establish that

he is in possession or occupation of the land upon a valid permit or other

written authority of the State granted in accordance with any written law

1 Paragraph 7 of the petition filed before the Provincial High Court.

2 Paragraph 10 of the petition filed before the Provincial High Court.

6

and that such permit or authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise

rendered invalid . ... ff

The person on whom the quit notice was issued has not adduced any

ground as to why he should not be ejected from the relevant land.

This Court in the case of Muhandiram vs. Chairman, No.lll, Janatha

Estate Development Board3 held as follows.

" ... Unless the respondent-petitioner had established before the learned

Magistrate that he was in occupation of the land stated in the schedule to

the application on a valid permit or other written authority of the State, he

cannot continue to occupy the said land and in terms of the State Lands

(Recovery of Possession) Act, No.7 of 1979, the Magistrate has to make

an order directing the respondent and his dependents to be ejected from

the land . ... ff

In the instant case, it is clear that the person to be ejected has failed to

establish that he is in possession or occupation of the said land upon any

written authority of the state granted in accordance with any written law

and that such authority is in force and not revoked or otherwise rendered

invalid as required by section 9 of the Act.

7

Thus, the conclusion arrived at by the learned Magistrate to issue the

eviction order is correct.

Thus, this Court has no basis to interfere with the order of the Provincial

High Court dismissing the revision application filed before it.

For the foregoing reasons, this Court decides to dismiss this revision

application with costs fixed at Rs. 30,000/= payable to the state by the

Petitioner.

Application is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 30,000/=.
