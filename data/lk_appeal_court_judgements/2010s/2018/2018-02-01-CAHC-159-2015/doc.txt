Accused-appellant lS present m Court produced by the

Prison Authorities.

Counsel for the accused-appellant has obtained instructions

from the accused-appellant to withdraw the application and makes

submissions pointing certain shortcomings in the judgment and the

conviction. The accused-appellant present in Court when inquired in

Sinhala confirms that he wants to withdraw the appeal and he wants the

Counsel to make submissions. Counsel submits that;

(1) there are several shortcomings in this case including the date of

offence. The date of offence is not certain in the judgment.

(2) There is a family dispute very much after the incident namely,

the accused and his wife and the child who was the wife's sister's

son living with the grandmother and visiting the house of the

accused to watch TV and to spent time. The family dispute was

reported in somewhere in 2nd week of June and this complaint was

made after that incident. Counsel submits that there are lot of

shortcomings but to save the time of Court, he wishes to make an

appeal to the Court to consider shortcoming and default in the

sentence and reduction in the sentence namely, he moves the

Court to give the minimum mandatory sentence. Further he

submits that he is not challenging the conviction.

The Deputy Solicitor General who is appeanng for the Attorney

General, maintaining the highest tradition of the Department admits that

there are certain shortcoming but he states the incident as it described

is serious of nature. Therefore, he supports the conviction and regarding

the sentence he leaves to the discretion of the Court. Considering all the

submissions the Court favourably considered the application made by

the accused-appellant and decides as follows:-

1. Since the conviction is not challenged we affirm the

conviction but we observe the evidence and the judgment.

Therefore, we decided to reconsider the sentence imposed.

3

On the accused-appellant. We impose 07 years Rigorous

Imprisonment instead of 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment.

\2. All the other conditions namely, Rs.10,000/= fine in default

06 months imprisonment will remain as it is. Further

Rs.100,000/= compensation to be paid to the victim child in

default of 12 months Rigorous Imprisonment will also

remain as it is. The 7 years Rigorous Imprisonment will be

implemented from the date of conviction. We direct the

Prison Authorities to implement the sentence from the date

of conviction namely, 18th of September 2015.

Conviction affirmed. Sentence varied.
