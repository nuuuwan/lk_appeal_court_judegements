This is an appeal against the order of the learned High Court Judge of the Provincial High Court

(Civil Appeal) of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle dated 02.08.2010.

The Petitioner-Appellant (Appellant) was at all times material to this application the Manager of

the Mawanella fuel station maintained by the pt Respondent-Respondent (1st Respondent).

On or about 10.04.2007 the Appellant received a letter demand from the 1st Respondent calling

upon him to pay a sum of Rs. 3,29,007.69 being the value ofthe shortage offuel at the Mawanella

fuel station. The Appellant denied liability and the 3rd Respondent-Respondent (3rd Respondent)

thereafter appointed the 2nd Respondent-Respondent (2nd Respondent) as arbitrator to hear and

determine the said dispute between the Appellant and the 1st Respondent.

After an inquiry, the 2nd Respondent made his award on or about 30.08.2008 (@o.6) by which he

held that the Appellant should pay the pt Respondent a sum of Rs. 1,15,472.39 for the shortage

of fuel. Both the Appellant and the pt Respondent preferred two appeals to the 3rd Respondent.

The position of the Appellant was that there was a defect in the two pumps and the meters.

The 3rd Respondent held that there was a defect in only one diesel pump and the 2nd Respondent

erred in cutting off the complete loss on that basis. He further held that both the management

of the 1st Respondent and the Appellant knew of the defect in the pump and meter but yet

continued to issue diesel. Therefore, he made order (6'0.8) apportioning the loss between the

parties and hence made final order directing the Appellant to pay the pt Respondent a sum of

Rs. 2,25,496.34 for the fuel shortage. The Appellant invoked the jurisdiction of the Provincial High

Court (Civil Appeal) of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle seeking writs of certiorari

to quash 6'0.6 and 6'0.8. The High Court refused the application and hence this appeal.

The Appellant sought to assail the decision of the 2nd Respondent 6'0.6 on the basis that his

findings are inconsistent with the evidence led before him. However, as Seneviratne J. held in

Nicholas v. Macon Markar Limited [(1985) 1 SrLL.R. 130 at 139]:

"There is a fine distinction between, "appeal" and "judicial review". When hearing an

appeal, the court is concerned with the merits of the decision in appeal. The question

before court is whether the decision subject matter of the appeal is right or wrong. In the

case of judicial review, the question before the court is whether the decision or order is

lawful, that is, according to law."

The common law grounds heads of judicial review are illegality, irrationality and procedural

impropriety [Council of Civil Service Union v. Minister for the Civil Service (1985) AC 374(HL)].

There Lord Diplock went on to state:

"By "illegality" as a ground for judicial review I mean that the decision-maker must

understand correctly the law that regulates his decision-making power and must give

effect to it. Whether he has or not is par excellence a justiciable question to be decided,

in the event of dispute, by those persons, the judges, by whom the judicial power of the

state is exercisable.

Page 3 of 5

By "irrationality" I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as "Wednesbury

unreasonableness" (Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation

[1948] 1 KB 223). It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or

of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the

question to be decided could have arrived at it. Whether a decision falls within this

category is a question that judges by their training and experience should be well

equipped to answer, or else there would be something badly wrong with our judicial

system. To justify the court's exercise of this role, resort I think is today no longer needed

to Viscount Radcliffe's ingenious explanation in Edwards v. Bairstow [1956] AC 14 of

irrationality as a ground for a court's reversal of a decision by ascribing it to an inferred

though unidentifiable mistake of law by the decision-maker. "Irrationality" by now can

stand upon its own feet as an accepted ground on which a decision may be attacked by

judicial review.

I have described the third head as "procedural impropriety" rather than failure to observe

basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards the person

who wi" be affected by the decision. This is because susceptibility to judicial review under

this head covers also failure by an administrative tribunal to observe procedural rules that

are expressly laid down in the legislative instrument by which its jurisdiction is conferred,

even where such failure does not involve any denial of natural justice. But the instant case

is not concerned with the proceedings of an administrative tribunal at all."

The Appe"ant's attack on the lack of evidence may have been successful if that amounted to a

"jurisdictional fact" bringing it within the head illegality. In my view it is not and at the most the

attack is on facts that goes to the merits of the case. Thus, for the Appellant to succeed he must

establish that there was a "total lack of evidence" or "no evidence" which he has failed to do.

The Appellant sought to assail the order made by the 3rd Respondent in appeal @0.8 on the basis

that it was made without hearing the Appellant. Section 58(4) of the Co-operative Societies Law

No.5 of 1972 states that no party to an appeal made to the Registrar under subsection 3 shall be

entitled either by himself or by any representative to appear before or be heard by the Registrar

on such appeal. This excludes both oral and written hearing [Piyadasa v. Sri Jayawardenapura

Multi-Purpose Co-operative Society Ltd. (2002) 3 SrLL.R. 294]. This issue is put beyond doubt by

Rule 49(xii)(c) of the Rules made under section 61 of Co-operative Societies Law No.5 of 1972

which states that the Registrar has the power to determine the appeal without hearing any party

to the dispute. Accordingly, the 3rd Respondent acted within his powers in determining the

appeal without hearing any party to the dispute. There is no procedural impropriety in that

decision.

The decision of the 3rd Respondent to apportion the loss between the parties and hence the final

order directing the Appellant to pay the pt Respondent a sum of Rs. 2,25,496.34 for the fuel

shortage is not illegal or irrational.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reason to interfere with the order of the learned High Court

Judge of the Provincial High Court (Civil Appeal) of the Sabaragamuwa Province holden in Kegalle

dated 02.08.2010.

The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at Rs. 25,000/=.

In conclusion, I am compelled to observe that none of the parties filed any written submissions

although court invited them to do so. This has occurred in several other cases as well. Written

submissions of the parties play an important role in assisting court to dispense justice as well as

looking after the interest of the client. Counsel must ensure that the duty they owe both to

court and client are duly performed.
