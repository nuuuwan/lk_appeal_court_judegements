Respondents

Before: Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

Counsel: U.L. Ali Zakky for the Petitioner.

Anusha Fernando, D.S.G., for the Respondents.

Decided on: 19.10.2018

Samayawardhena, J.

The Petitioner filed this application seeking two substantive

reliefs against the 1st Respondent:

(a) to issue a writ of mandamus to promote the Petitioner

to the Post of Lecturer Grade I under the previous

scheme of promotion marked P8; and

(b) to issue a writ of certiorari to quash the promotions of

the Assistant Lecturers who had (as per P13 and P16)

already availed themselves of one opportunity for

promotion under the previous scheme of promotion.

The 1st Respondent in paragraph 5(e) of his statement of

objections and also in the written submissions has stated that

the (b) above need not be pursued as it has already been done

after the institution of this action.

Then the outstanding matter to be decided is the (a) above.

The Petitioner at present is a Senior Lecturer (Lecturer Grade I)

at the 4th Respondent InstitutionSri Lanka Institute of

Advanced Technological Educations.

According to P8, a Lecturer Grade II is eligible to be promoted to

Grade I provided he or she fulfils two conditions. If I may quote

the relevant portion of P8 verbatim, those two conditions are: A

Masters Degree/Post Graduate Qualification in the field and 03

years experience as a Lecturer.

It is common ground that the Petitioner completed her Post

Graduate Diploma in Education on 01.08.2001 (P6) and

4

completed her three-year service as a Lecturer Grade II on

16.08.2005. Accordingly, it is the contention of the Petitioner

that she should have been promoted to Grade I effective from

16.08.2005.

However, the 1st Respondent has denied the Petitioner the said

promotion on the basis that her Post Graduate Qualification,

which is the Post Graduate Diploma in Education, is not in the

relevant field. It is the position of the 1st Respondent that the

Petitioner was initially recruited as an Assistant Lecturer in

Agriculture and therefore her relevant field is Agriculture.

In the first place, P8 does not say the Post Graduate

Qualification to be in the relevant field. It only says in the

field.

The 1st Respondent in paragraph 4(c) of his objections explains

why in the field in P8 shall be read as in the relevant field.

That paragraph reads thus:

However, pursuant to a clarification obtained from the 2nd

Respondent on 28.07.05 that eligibility for promotions to Senior

Lecturer required a Postgraduate Diploma in the relevant field in

terms of P8, no further promotions were given thereafter, to

applicants who did not possess a relevant Postgraduate

qualification.

The clarification referred to in the above paragraph has been

marked as 1R1.

5

It is my considered view that the former part of the above quoted

paragraph is a misrepresentation of facts and the latter part is

false.

The impression given to Court by the 1st Respondent by the

former part of the paragraph was, that he obtained a

clarification from the 2nd Respondent on what was meant by in

the field in P8 and 1R1 was the reply to it.

As seen from paragraph 1 of 1R1, it is a reply to a letter sent by

the 1st Respondent (in fact, the former Director General-Dr.

Obeysekera) to the 2nd Respondent dated 25.07.2005. The letter

dated 25.07.2005 was not tendered by the 1st Respondent, but it

was tendered by the Petitioner marked P34A with her counter

affidavit. By looking at P34A, it is abundantly clear that the 1st

Respondent has sought a clarification not on the matter in

contest, but on some other matter regarding promotions. It is

on that basis I state that the former part of that paragraph is a

misrepresentation of facts.

Leave that as it may, the 1st Respondent does not need to take

pains to rely on 1R1 dated 28.07.2005 to say that in the field

in P8 shall be taken to mean in the relevant field, because it

has so been understood by his predecessors before the

purported clarification was obtained by 1R1.

For instance, in P11, the former Director General of the 1st

Respondent-Dr. Obeysekera in calling for applications for the

Post of Lecturer Grade I, has stated that applicants inter alia

Should have obtained Post graduate qualifications from a

6

recognized University/Institution (Post graduate degree/Post

graduate Diploma or equivalent Qualification in the relevant field.

The Petitioner is a lecturer. All these years the Post Graduate

Diploma in Education has been considered as a qualification in

the relevant field across the board irrespective of their

field/subject of teaching when promotions are given from Grade

II to Grade Ivide the List of names in P12 tendered by the

Petitioner, which has been accepted by the 1st Respondent by

paragraph 4(b) of the objections except in the case of Ms. K.N.D.

Alwis.

In that sense, the Petitioner can also succeed on the ground of

legitimate expectation.

Regarding Ms. Alwis, the 1st Respondent in paragraph 4(b)(i) of

the objections says that Ms. K.N.D. Alwis named therein applied

for a promotion to the post of Lecturer and not Senior Lecturer and

as such P11 was not applicable to her. This is also incorrect as

seen from P34(b) tendered with the counter affidavit of the

Petitioner, which proves that she was promoted to the Post of

Senior Lecturer (i.e. Lecturer Grade I). If she in fact applied for a

promotion to the Post of Lecturer and not to the Post of Senior

Lecturer, it is not clear how she was given a double promotion

even without a proper application!

It is incongruous to say in defence by the 1st Respondent in

paragraphs 4(j) and 7(c) of the objections that those who were

promoted as such under the misconception have now left the 4th

Respondent Institution and therefore the same

(mis)interpretation need not be given in the case of the

7

Petitioner. That argument would have had some validity if the

Petitioner was offered the promotion to Grade I subject to her

leaving the Institution!

I am unable to accept the argument of the 1st Respondent in

paragraph 4(i) of the objections that the Petitioner is seeking to

rely on a mistake made in the past in the interpretation of P8. In

the facts and circumstances of this case, I cannot bring myself

to consider it as a mistake made by the predecessors of the 1st

Respondent.

According to P34(e), the following areas are covered in the Post

Graduate Diploma in Education Programme.

1. Principles of Education

2. Educational Psychology

3. Assessment of Learning Outcomes

4. Student Adjustment and Counselling

5. Techniques of Teaching

6. Curriculum School and Society

7. Comparative Education and Educational Problems

8. Educational Administration and Management

9. Teaching Practice

As I have already stated, the Petitioner is a lecturer/teacher.

There cannot be a dispute that having a thorough knowledge of

the subject itself does not make a good lecturer/teacher. For

effective learning to take place, the lecturer/teacher must not

only have good subject knowledge but also effective pedagogical

skills if they are to get the ideas across to the students. In that

sense, the argument of the 1st Respondent in paragraphs 4(k)

8

and 7(e) of the objections that the granting of the relief would

lower the standard of the Institution since the main duty of the

lectures such as the Petitioners is teaching the subject, is

misconceived.

Not only until purported clarification 1R1 was obtained, even

thereafter, the Post Graduate Diploma in Education has been

considered as a qualification in the relevant field across the

boardvide P34(a)-(c) tendered with the counter objections of the

Petitioner. That is why I stated earlier that the latter part of the

paragraph 4(c) of the objections of the 1st Respondent is false.

According to the date stamp placed on it, 1R1 has been received

by the 1st Respondent (former Director General) on 28.07.2005.

Lecturer Mrs. Alwis whose field is English has been promoted to

the Post of Lecturer Grade I, considering the Post Graduate

Diploma in Education as a qualification in the relevant field after

1R1vide P34(b) dated 29.07.2005. As per P34(d) dated

09.07.2008, nearly 3 years after 1R1, the Governing Council of

the 4th Respondent Institution has confirmed that promotion.

Lecturer Mrs. Hewapathirana whose field is commerce has been

promoted to the Post of Lecturer Grade I, considering the Post

Graduate Diploma in Education as a qualification in the relevant

field after 1R1vide P34(c) dated 29.07.2005.

At the argument, as the learned Deputy Solicitor General for the

Respondents could not satisfactorily explain how those

promotions were given after obtaining the purported clarification

by 1R1, the Court with the consent of learned counsel for the

Petitioner gave another opportunity to explain it by way of a

9

further affidavit, which has been done. In that affidavit, the 1st

Respondent says that even though those letters have been

signed after 1R1, as the interviews were held and promotions

were decided before the receipt of 1R1, the promotions had to be

effected from the date of the interview.

If that explanation is correct, I cannot understand why the 1st

Respondent did not adopt the same theory in respect of some of

the Assistant Lecturers who had tried to have a second

promotion under the previous scheme of promotion, because by

the time the clarification was obtained by 1R3, promotions of

them had already been decided!

I must pause for a while to say that the 1st Respondent explains

as such, as if those promotions reflected in P34(a)-(c) were given

by him. But it is not so. Those decisions have been taken not

by the 1st Respondent but by his predecessors. Therefore he

cannot by way of an affidavit explain on what basis such

promotions were given by his predecessors even after 1R1,

taking the Post Graduate Diploma in Education as a

qualification in the relevant field. The 1st Respondent is trying

to mislead the Court on that point. In the facts and

circumstances of this case, the predecessors of the 1st

Respondent have not sent P34(b)-(d) on the basis the 1st

Respondent is now attempting to attribute. Simply speaking,

they did not have such an issue. This issue is a creation of the

1st Respondent himself.

The 1st Respondent with his objections has tendered 1R2 to say

that he obtained a further clarification from the 2nd Respondent

10

on this matter which confirms that the Post Graduate Diploma

in Education cannot be considered as a qualification in the

relevant field. Firstly, if 1R1 was the clarification to in the field

in P8, there was no necessity to have another clarification for the

second time. Secondly, 1R2, like P11, speaks of in the relevant

field, but does not say that the Post Graduate Diploma in

Education shall not be considered as a qualification in the

relevant field. Thirdly, in any event, 1R2 has been obtained

about 9 years after P8 and about 9 months after the institution

of the action. It is trite law that the rights of the parties shall be

decided at the institution of the action. (Talagune v. De Livera

[1997] 1 Sri LR 253 at 255, Kalamazoo Industries Ltd v. Minister

of Labour and Vocational Training [1998] 1 Sri LR 235 at 248,

Lalwani v. Indian Overseas Bank [1998] 3 Sri LR 197 at 198)

At this juncture it is pertinent to mention that this old scheme of

promotion reflected in P8 is no longer valid and operative. It has

been replaced with a new scheme of promotion effective as far

back as from 01.01.2008. The new scheme of promotion

marked P27 has a new set of qualifications. Hence the position

of the 1st Respondent that if the application of the Petitioner is

allowed it will result in a floodgate situation where others in a

similar situation to the Petitioner could also seek to obtain their

promotions based on the mistaken interpretation of P8 is

unfounded. The orders of the Court depend on the facts and

circumstances of each individual case. There is no

generalization. If there is a doubt, the new scheme of promotion

can be amended to clear the doubt.

11

The 1st Respondent has also produced 1R4(a) and (b) with his

further affidavit to say that subsequent to 1R1 being obtained,

promotions have been granted subject to the lecturer obtaining the

requisite post graduate qualification in the relevant field. IR4(a)

and (b), in my view, do not satisfy, any of the two schemes of

promotionsP8 or P27. By those two letters, two lecturers have

been promoted to Grade I in anticipation of a future

achievement! The two lecturers have been promoted to Grade I

effective from 23.03.2011 subject to the condition that you will

complete a Master Degree in the relevant discipline on or before

23rd March 2014. These two promotions have also been given

by one of the former Director Generals of the 4th Respondent

Institution and not by the 1st Respondent.

The 1st Respondent in the further affidavit also says that there

were six others who were in the same position as the Petitioner

(and the Petitioners in the two connected cases) who sought

their promotions based on the Post Graduate Diploma in

Education, but they in the meantime obtained the qualifications

in their relevant fields and therefore enabled SLIATE to grant

their promotions, which have been backdated in order to ensure

that no prejudice is caused to them. It is not clear what the 1st

Respondent meant by promotions were backdated. Is it,

backdated to the date the Post Graduate Diploma in Education

was obtained?

Further affidavit seems to be providing more questions than

answers!

12

For the aforesaid reasons, I issue a writ of mandamus directing

the 1st Respondent to promote the Petitioner to the Post of

Lecturer Grade I under the previous scheme of promotion

marked P8 with effect from 16.08.2005. The Petitioner will also

be entitled to salary increments, salary arrears and other

statutory entitlements accordingly. The 1st Respondent shall

pay incurred costs of the action to the Petitioner.

As agreed, the parties in the two connected cases, i.e.

CA/WRIT/372/2016 and CA/WRIT/387/2016, will abide by

this Judgment.
