JUDGMENT

P Pad man Surasena 1 (P CIA)

The Petitioner - Respondent - Appellant (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Appellant) had instituted this case against the Respondent -

Petitioner - Respondents (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the

" 4

Respondents) in the Primary Court of Attanagalla under section 66 (1) (b)

of the Primary Courts Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979, as a private

information, seeking an order declaring that he be entitled to have the

possession of the impugned premises.

Learned Primary Court Judge having inquired into this complaint, had by

his order dated 2011-03-28, had concluded that the Appellant is entitled to

the possession of the premises.

Being aggrieved by the said order made by the learned Primary Court

Judge, the Respondents had filed an application for revision in the

Provincial High Court of Western Province holden in Gampaha seeking a

revision of the order made by the learned Primary Court Judge.

The Provincial High Court after hearing parties, set aside the order of the

learned Primary Court Judge on the basis that an appeal against the order

of the District Court delivered in respect of the same subject matter is

pending.

It is against that judgment that the Appellant has appealed to this Court.

It is common ground,

i. that the said District Court case is in respect of the same subject

matter as in the instant case,

ii. that the District Court had dismissed the action filed by the

Respondent praying for the possession of the disputed premises,

iii. that the District Court in that judgment had held that although the

Appellant is an over holding lessee he cannot be evicted because the

Rent Act applies to the instant dispute,

iv. that the breach of peace complained in the instant case occurred

when the Appellant went to open the said premises after the District

Court judgment was delivered,

v. that the Appellant had halted his business activities upon an interim

order made by the District Court.

Perusal of the judgment of the District Court shows that the Respondent

had instituted the said District Court case to evict the Appellant who

continues to be in possession even after the lapse of the lease agreement.

Indeed this fact was not denied by the learned counsel for the Respondent.

This shows that the Respondents had admitted that it was the Appellant

who was in the possession of the disputed premises at least as at the date

6

of filing the said District Court case. Perusal of the enjoining order issued

by the District Court shows that the said order had prevented the Appellant

from carrying on his business at the impugned premises. This too further

buttresses the position that the Appellant had possessed the premises.

It is common ground that the said District Court case has been concluded.

As such, there is no order by a competent Court. To the contrary, the

judgment of the District Court has confirmed that it was the Appellant who

is entitled to the possession. The reason as to why learned District Judge

had refused to evict the Appellant is the application of the provisions of the

Rent Act to the disputed premises. Therefore, it is the Appellant who has

been in possession of the relevant premises on the date of the filing of the

information in Primary Court under section 66 of the Primary Courts

Procedure Act No. 44 of 1979.

It is a fact that the Respondents had disturbed the peaceful possession of

the Appellant. Learned Primary Court Judge has held that the Appellant is

entitled to the possession of the said premises. There is no basis for the

learned Provincial High Court Judge to set aside the order of the learned

Primary Court Judge as the District Court action has been concluded.

7

For the foregoing reasons this Court is of the opinion that it cannot justify

the impugned order made by the learned Provincial High Court Judge.

In these circumstances this Court proceeds to set aside, the order of the

learned Provincial High Court Judge dated 2012-08-23 and affirm the order

dated 2011-03-28 made by the learned Primary Court Judge of Attanagalla.

No cost is granted.
