BEFORE : M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J. COUNSEL : P. L. Gunawardana with K. C. Perera for the

2A, 3rd & 10th Defendant-Appellants Chithral Fernando for the Substituted Plaintiff-

Respondent R. Wimalaratna for the 9A Defendant-

Respondent WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS TENDERED ON : 23.07.2018 (by the 2A, 3rd & 10th Defendant-

Appellants and the Substituted Plaintiff-Respondent) 09.08.2018 by the 9A defendant-Respondent DECIDED ON : 14.12.2018

********

M. M. A. GAFFOOR, J.

The Plaintiff-Respondent initially instituted this partition action by

Plaint dated 28.04.1983 in the District Court of Galle against the 1st to

10th Defendants to partition the land called Addarakumbura situated at

Kalahe in Talpe pattu in the District of Galle. The Preliminary Plan No.

375 dated 12.01.1984 and the relevant report prepared by the Court

Commissioner G. H. C. L. de Silva (at pages 239-242).

After conclusion of the trial, the learned District Judge had entered

judgment on 27.06.1997 allotting shares to the Plaintiff and 1st and 2nd

Defendants in the following manner (vide page 181 0f the appeal brief):

4

- Plaintiff 62/150

- 1st defendant 75/150

- 2nd Defendant 13/150

Bing aggrieved by this judgment the 2A, 3 and 10th Defendant-

Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants) preferred this

instant appeal seeking to set aside the judgment.

In this appeal, Appellants and 9th A Defendant-Respondent have made

their respective submissions.

The position taken by the Appellants was that the learned trial judge

had failed to observe the consistency of the pedigree set out by the

Appellants together with the 9th Defendant-Respondent. They further

stated that the learned trial judge had failed to evaluate the evidence of

the 9th Defendant-Respondent with regard to the interest of the

Appellants; the deeds marked as 2V2, 3V2, 3V3 and 10V1 have not been

considered by the learned trial judge and as a result the said Defendants

have not been allotted any shares in the judgment thus causing a severe

prejudice to the said Defendants.

The main contentions of the 9A Defendant-Respondent are:

1. That the Trial Judge had based his judgment on the original

Plaint and had ignored to proceed on the amended Plaint

2. The Plaintiff had failed to establish properly the devolution of

title of the corpus.

5

In this case, it is to be noted that all parties have admitted the corpus

as per Plan No. 375 dated 12.01.1984 and the relevant report

prepared by the Court Commissioner G. H. C. L. de Silva.

When the trial was commenced in the District Court, the learned

District Judge had noted that the property of the 2nd Defendant-

Appellant had been transferred to 3rd Defendant after institution of

the action. But this transfer had not been done subject to the

prevailing partition action (page 189 of the appeal brief).

The learned District had further observed that, taking into

consideration the cumulative effect of the oral and documentary

evidence, the Plaintiff-Respondent had proved his pedigree and title

(vide page 189).

The learned District Judge in his judgment further observed the fact

that the Plaintiff-Respondent or the 9th Defendant had failed to elicit

evidence as regards to Aranolis pertaining to P1 and 1V1, the Court

was not inclined to accept these documents are forged ones (vide page

187 of the appeal brief).

It is also to be noted that when considering the entire judgment this

Court observes that the learned District Judge had considered the

material in the amended Plaint, although he had not specifically

mentioned so.

In this regard, it is to be stressed that the observation of the Hon. G.

P. S. De Silva, C. J. in Alwis vs. Piyasena Fernando (1993) 1 SLR 119

when he emphasized that:

6

"..it is well established that findings of primary facts by a trial

Judge who hears and sees witnesses are not to be lightly disturbed

on appeal.

In Ariyadasa vs. Attorney General (2012) 1 SLR 84 the Court observed

as follows:

Court of Appeal will not lightly disturb a finding of a Judge

with regard to the acceptance or rejection of a testimony of a

witness , unless It is manifestly wrong, when the trial Judge has

taken such a decision after observing the demeanor and the

deportment of a witness...

In Kumara de Silva and two others vs. Attorney General (2010) 2 SLR

169, Sarath de Abrew, J. had held that:

Credibility is a question of fact, not of law. The acceptance or

rejection of evidence of witnesses is therefore a question of fact for

the trial Judge.

In the circumstances enumerated above, this Court sees no valid reason

to interfere in the above judgment of the learned District Judge of Galle.

Therefore, I dismiss this appeal without Costs.
