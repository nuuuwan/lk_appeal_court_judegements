y a petition dated 05.0l.2017, the Petitioner prayed for an order in terms of Section

63 of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No. 02 of 1988, challenging her

expulsion from 1st Respondent~United National Party. When this matter came up for

support on 05.12.2017, a date was moved for on behalf of the Petitioner to furnish

further documents as the documentation was insufficient for support. The matter was

fixed to be supported on 22.03.2017. On 22.03.2017, on the application of junior

Counsel for a date on behalf of the President's Counsel for the Petitioner, this Court

granted another date namely 02.06.2017 to have this matter supported for notice. When

the matter came up again on 02.06.2017 for support by a motion dated 01.06.2017 and

filed by the Petitioner, an application was made to have the matter taken off the

3

support list. Thus this matter was taken off the support list on 02.06.2017 and fixed to

be supported again on 05.09.2107. As a holiday fell on this day, the matter was re,fixed

to be supported on 12.10.2017. On 12.10 2017 this Court had to narrate the chronology of

events to show as to how the natter was getting postponed for support and even on

this day an application was made to have the support re,fixed as the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner was otherwise engaged at a Commission. Finally this Court fixed the

matter for support on 02.11.2017,a date which was notified by junior Counsel to be

convenient to the learned Counsel for the Petitioner.

When the matter came up on 02.11.2017, all Counsel agreed that the Court could

dispose of the question of notice on written submissions to be filed by parties and thus

all Counsel invited Court to dispense with oral arguments for notice. Mr. Heejaz

Hisbullah the learned Counsel for the 1S\ 2nd and 3rd Respondents stated that he would

be tendering his limited objections to the application of the Petitioner. Now that the

objections on behalf of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents and the written submissions of

the Petitioner have since been filed, this Court proceeds to consider the question of

whether notice should be issued or not based on the aforesaid objections and the

written submissions.

The pleadings filed in the case reveal that the United National Party decided to support

the candidature of His Excellency the President' Maithripala Sirisena, when he

contested the Presidential Elections held on 05.01.2015. At the time of the election

campaign the Petitioner was admittedly the UNP Organizer for Pathadumbara, Central

Province.

Upon a perusal of the material before this Court, it is apparent that whilst the elections

campaign was in progress on 26.12.2014, the Petitioner resigned from her position as

Organizer and joined the campaign of the SlFP.

Consequent to these events, Mr. Asendra Siriwardena, the Secretary to the Disciplinary

Committee of the UNP notified the Petitioner informing her inter alia the following:,

4

a) That the Petitioner had acted contrary to the decision taken by the United

National Party, its Executive Committee and the Party Convention and had

supported the candidature of the Hon. Mahinda Rajapakse,

b) That the Petitioner had criticized the United National party and its leadership,

c) That the Petitioner did not support the candidature of Hon. Maithripala Sirisena,

d) That the Petitioner had addressed political rallies and meetings in support of

Hon. Mahinda Rajapakse,

e) That all the evidence against the Petitioner had been collected by the 1st

Respondent and it had referred the same along with the complaints received to

the Disciplinary Committee of the United National Party,

f) That the United National Party Disciplinary Committee considered the above

material and came to the conclusion that the Petitioner, during the 2015

Presidential Elections, had not acted as a member of the United National Party

and acted contrary to the decisions and the directions of the United National

Party,

g) That the Petitioner had accordingly violated several provisions of the United

National Party Constitution.

The communication that was dated 06th March 2015 and addressed to the Petitioner by

Mr. Asendra Siriwardena called upon the Petitioner to show cause for the allegations.

The communication notified the Petitioner that since the Disciplinary Committee had

decided to hold an inquiry into the allegations made against the Petitioner, she should

submit a written cause on or before 2th March 2015. The letter further informed the

Petitioner that in the event she did not submit an acceptable explanation on or before

2th March 2015, she would be deemed to have accepted the charges and the

Disciplinary Committee would proceed to take further steps. In the written

submissions filed on 23.11.2017, the Petitioner points out that she responded to the

show cause letter both by registered post and courier by a repudiation of all charges

dated 20th March 2015. By 28th April 2015, the petitioner also instituted an action in the

District Court of Nugegoda seeking a declaration that the show cause notice dated 06th

5

March 2015 was null and void and an injunction to restrain the 2nd, 3rd and Asendra

Siriwardena from going ahead with an inquiry. The learned District Judge of Nugegoda

refused the enjoining order sought by the Petitioner. Consequently, the Petitioner filed

WP/HCCNMount/MT/11120l5/LA by way of a Leave to Appeal application in the Civil

Appellate High Court of Mount Lavinia. On 20.10.20l6 the Civil Appellate High Court of

Mount Lavinia granted Leave to Appeal to the Petitioner. This Court has not been

apprised of the current position of the leave to appeal application.

But the fact remains that as for the show cause that was required of the Petitioner,

there was no order inhibiting the United National Party-the rt Respondent to receive it

and continue with an inquiry if it was unacceptable and upon a perusal of the pleadings

it is apparent that the repudiation forwarded by the Petitioner in response to the show

cause does not categorically and expressly deny the charges levelled against the

Petitioner. In those circumstances the Disciplinary Committee of the 1st Respondent

party had proceeded to appoint a panel of inquiry to investigate the charges made

against the Petitioner and by his letter dated 15th September 20l5, the Secretary to the

Disciplinary Committee notified the Petitioner of the appointment of the members of

the panel of inquiry. A charge sheet dated 16th September 2015 was also issued on the

Petitioner notifying her that the disciplinary inquiry would be held on 30.09.2015 and

she could lead oral and written evidence at this inquiry with legal assistance of her

choice.

By a letter dated 29th September 20l5, the Petitioner responded stating that she would

not be participating at the inquiry on 30.09.20l5 as the notice summoning her for the

inquiry was too short.

Chronology of events surrounding the Disciplinary Inquiry

As could be seen, the first day the petitioner was summoned for the inquiry was 30th

September 2015 on which date she did not participate owing to the short notice. The

petitioner was informed again by a letter dated 14th October 2015 that a future date

would be notified to her in due course. Accordingly, she received a notification by a

6

letter dated 15th October 2015 that the next date would be 3tt October 2015. The

Petitioner submitted a medical certificate and excused herself from participating at the

enquiry on that day owing to illness. Then between November 2015 and 18th September

2016, there were four dates of enquiry, namely 14th November 2015, 2nd July 2016, 06th

October 2016 and 18th September 2016, but on none of those dates, the Petitioner

appeared at the inquiry having cited reasons of ill health or overseas travels. At last the

Petitioner herself admits to making an appearance at the inquiry on 18th September

2016 and handing over preliminary objections on that day. Adverting to this brief

appearance, the Respondents state in their objections that after bringing up various

objections the Petitioner left without participating at the hearing.

It is averred in the objections of the Respondents that since the Petitioner did not take

part at the proceedings of the inquiry, the panel of inquiry proceeded with the inquiry

ex parte and the evidence of witnesses was led. Upon the conclusion of the inquiry, the

panel submitted its decision to the Disciplinary Committee of the tt Respondent party,

which in turn forwarded its decision to the working committee of the party.

After considering the report submitted by the Disciplinary Committee, the Working

Committee of the 1st Respondent party decided to terminate the membership of the

Petitioner and the 2nd Respondent informed the Petitioner and the Secretary of the

Central Provincial Council by letters dated 14th December 2016 and 15th December 2016

of the decision~vide the letters dated 14th December 2016, 15th December 2016 and

proceedings of the inquiry that have been produced before this Court as R23, R24 and

R25.

The proceedings dated 18th September 2016~the day on which the Petitioner appeared

and submitted her preliminary objections indicate that the objections had been

considered and rejected. The panel of inquiry comprising Mr. Joy Nanayakkara,

Chairman and Mr. Yasas de Silva, Attorney~at~law makes the observation that between

the service of the charge sheet on 16.09.2015 and 18.09.2016, there had been no attempt

to deal with the charges on the part of the Petitioner and the objective of the Petitioner

appeared to be dilatory in order to delay the proceedings. We cannot but fail to observe

7

that the 1st Respondent has taken steps to afford the Petitioner audi alteram parton but

one cannot complain of absence of it if the Petitioner herself renders it incapable of

being accorded to her by not fully participating at the inquiry and challenging the

witnesses. One cannot just tender preliminary objections and walk away from an

inquiry. The fact that the Petitioner walked away from the inquiry is quite evident from

the disciplinary proceedings and in the view of this Court it was a denial to oneself the

benefits of natural justice that were being offered.

Expulsion / Termination of Membership

The Petitioner received a letter by registered post from the General Secretary of the

United National Party, notifying the Petitioner that she was removed from the United

National Party. The said letter was dated 14th December 2016. This letter narrates in

detail the process that was adopted to arrive at the decision to expel the Petitioner

from the party. The letter from the Secretary of the tt Respondent party quite clearly

stated that the Petitioner had violated Articles 3.3 (a), (b), (d) and 3.4 (a), (b), (c), (d)

and (e) of the Constitution of the United National Party. The removal of the

membership of the Petitioner from the 1st Respondent party came into effect on

08.12.2016. This letter had been copied to the Secretary, Central Provincial Council and

it is on record that the Petitioner received a letter by registered post from the Secretary

of the Central Provincial Council, notifying her of the decision of the United National

Party regarding her membership. The said letter was dated 21st December 2016.

Having thus alluded to the process that had taken place preceding the removal of the

Petitioner, this Court would now set out the law pertaining to applications under

Section 63 of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No.2 of 1988.

Scope and Ambit of the Inquiry under Section 63 of the Provincial Councils

Elections Act No.2 of 1988

Before this Court proceeds to pronounce its determination on the expulsion, this Court

would bear in mind the scope and ambit of the provisions setting out the remit of the

inquiry under Section 63(1) of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No.2 of 1988.

8

Section 63(1) of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No.2 of 1988 sets out the

following: -

"Where a member of a Provincial Council ceases, by resignation, expulsion or otherwise, to be a

member of a recognized political party or independent group on whose nomination paper his

name appeared at the time of his becoming such member, his seat shall become vacant upon the

expiration of a period of one month from the date of his ceasing to be such member:

Provided that in the case of the expulsion of a member of a Provincial Council his seat shall not

become vacant if prior to the expiration of the said period of one month he applies to the Court

of Appeal by petition in writing and the Court of Appeal upon such application determines that

such expulsion was invalid ....... "

The aforesaid provision clearly sets out as to when the jurisdiction of this Court to

embark on the inquiry to ascertain the validity or otherwise of an expulsion of an

elected member of a Provincial Council is triggered. If the Petitioner invokes the

jUrisdiction of this Court prior to the expiration of one month of the expulsion, this

Court could assume jurisdiction to ascertain the vires of the expulsion and upon such

invocation of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal within one month of the

expulsion, the Petitioner continues to enjoy his status as a member of the Provincial

Council until that status is determined by a declaration of this Court that the

expulsion is valid. The question before this Court is whether the Petitioner in the

instant application has made out a case of invalidity of her expulsion.

Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal identical to that of the SC

As is apparent, the jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Appeal by the proviso to

Section 63(1) of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No.2 of 1988, is similar to the

jurisdiction conferred on the Supreme Court by the proviso to Article 99(13)(a) of the

Constitution in relation to members of Parliament. Fernando J. in Gamini Dissanayake

9

and Others v. MCM Kaleel and OtherS expressed his view on the extent of the

Supreme Court's jurisdiction under Article 99(13)(a) thus:~

"Our jurisdiction under Article 99(13) (a) is not a form ofjudicial review or even of appeal, but

rather an original jurisdiction analogous to an action for a declaration, though it is clearly not

a rehearing. Are we concerned only with the decision making process or must we look at the

decision itself? Article 99 (13) (a) requires us to decide whether the expulsion was valid or

invalid. Some consideration of the merits is obViously reqUired ... The burden, if any, must be on

the respondents, for it is the denial of natural justice by them which has resulted in these

proceedings. I have therefore to consider whether on the merits the respondents have shown that

the decision was a good one, thereby disentitling the petitioners to relief"

Dheeraratne, J. described the boundaries of the court's jurisdiction thus in Tilak

Karunaratne v. Mrs. Bandaranaike and Othed

"it is not disputed that court's jurisdiction includes an investigation into the requiSite

competence of the expelling authority; an investigation as to whether the expelling authority

followed the procedure if any which was mandatory in nature, an investigation as to whether

there was a breach of principles of natural justice in the determining process; and an

investigation as to whether in the event of the grounds of expulSion being specified by way of

charges at a domestic inquiry, the member was expelled on some other grounds which were not

so specified."

It is clear from the foregoing and on the strength of the authority of Gooneratne and

Others v. Premachandra and Othed that this court in exercising the jurisdiction

conferred on it by Section 63 of the Provincial Councils Elections Act, should inquire

whether the expelling body had:

i. acted within its jurisdiction;

ii. followed the procedure laid down in the Constitution of the party;

1 (1993) 2 Sri l.R. 135 at 198.

2 (1993) 2 Sri.LR 90.

3 (1994) 2 SrLLR 137. 10

iii. acted in compliance with the principles of natural justice before taking the

decision to expel the petitioners;

iv. and the grounds adduced for expelling the petitioners could be sustained; and

v. whether their alleged misconduct if proved, merited the extreme punishment

meted out to them.

Breach of Principles of NaturalJustice

The Petitioner has no doubt pleaded that there was an infringement of the rules of

natural justice in denying her a proper inquiry and there was no evidence to expel the

Petitioner from the United National Party. As regards this complaint this Court draws

in aid the pertinent observations of Justice Kulatunga, in Gamini Dissanayake4 The

learned Judge declared that:-

"the right of a M.P. to rdief under Article 99(13)(a) is a legal right and forms part of his

constitutional right as a M.P. If his complaint is that he has been expelled from membership of

his party in breach of the rules of natural justice, he will ordinarily be entitled to relief and this

court may not determine such expulsion to be valid unless there are overwhelming reasons

warranting such decision. Such decision would be competent only in the most exceptional

circumstances permitted by law and in furtherance of the public good the need for which should

be beyond doubt."

The letter of expulsion dated 14th December 2106 traces the reason for expulsion of the

Petitioner from the United National Party to the Petitioner taking an individualistic

decision quite contrary to that of her party at the Presidential Elections in 2015. On the

propositions laid down by Kulatunga, J. the l sr, 2nd and 3rd Respondents no doubt bear

the burden of satisfying this Court that the decision to expel the Petitioner was a

natural corollary consequent to a due process that had observed rules of natural justice.

The test that has to be applied is an objective test and not a subjective test. The

Respondents have placed material before this Court to satisfy this objective test that

4 See Supra In 1 at p.234 11

the Rules of Natural Justice was followed and that an overwhelming reason or

exceptional circumstances existed which merited the expulsion of the Petitioner or

that it was done for the public good.

Expulsion from an organisation ipso facto gives rise to misgivings of indiscipline and

suspicions of infractions of the rules, beliefs or customs of the association concerned. In

such a situation the member of such an organization against whom doubts about his

suitability to continue to be a member have been created should be afforded a hearing

before the specific charges are vindicated.

In this context it is apposite to quote the pertinent observations of Paul Jackson in his

seminal work on NaturalJustice.5

"There are at least three justifications for requiring a hearing even where there appears to be no

answer to a charge. First, experience shows that unanswerable charges may, if the opportunity

be given, be answered; inexplicable conduct be explained. Secondly, the party condemned

unheard will feel a sense of injustice. Thirdly, suspicion is inevitable that a body which refuses a

hearing before acting does so because of the lack of evidence not because of its strength"

As the sanction of expulsion spells a grave punishment, it is nothing bur fair that this

consequence follows upon the observance of audi alteram partem-the time honoured

incantation for everyone who decides anything.

Two principles of procedural impropriety have vied for observance by all inclusive of

judges who decide rights and liabilities. They are often classified as aspects of fair play

in action and have proved to be bulwarks for preserving rule of law in their peremptory

declarations that no man shall be condemned unheard and no man shall be a judge in

his own cause, as they are famously couched in the Latin tags audi alteram partem and

nemo iudexin re sua.

Having regard to the host of communications sent to the Petitioner, her participation

became essential at the inquiry as a result of the serious charges that had been laid

5 Natural Justice, Paul Jackson (Second Edition) 1979 at page 137 12

against her but the Petitioner let the opportunity go a begging. So this Court is not

persuaded that the Petitioner was expelled without having been afforded a proper

inquiry. There is material to the contrary and we find against the Petitioner on this

threshold question of a proper inquiry.

Applying the ratio of Dissanayake6 and Gooneratne/ to the facts of this application,

we find it patent that the Respondents have duly complied with the principles of

natural justice and as such the expulsion, the final decision that was reached is

supportable having regard to the evidence that emerged at the inquiry.

Another gravamen of the complaint of the Petitioner is that the Petitioner had filed the

DC Nugegoda Case No. 282/1SISpecial and an appeal from the decision of the District

Court was pending in the Civil Appellate High Court of Mount Lavinia, whilst the 1st

Respondent went ahead with the inquiry. As we observed before, there was no stay

order prohibiting the continuity of the disciplinary inquiry and therefore it is

preposterous to contend that the Respondents completely disregarded the order

granted by the Court and took a decision to expel the Petitioner from the United

National Party.

The Respondents on the contrary have taken up the argument that the institution of

the DC action was a bar to this application but we have not been put on notice of the

exact stage of the matter in the Civil Appellate Court in order to appreciate the merit of

this argument. Be that as it may, we do bear in mind that the Petitioner faced a charge

sheet that alluded to allegations of party indiscipline which she could have well met by

participating and impeaching the oral and documentary evidence that was arraigned

against her. In fact fealty to one's party was adverted to in Gamini Dissanayake v.

MCM Kaleef wherein the duty of a member of a party to owe allegiance to one's

party was emphasized:,

6 See Supra In 1.

7 See Supra In 3.

8 See Supra In 1 at pp 169 and 170.

13

"A voluntary association is a collection of individuals who have agreed to come together, for a

common purpose, under the single leader or a collective leadership. A political party is a

voluntary association the common objective of whose members is to secure governmental power

on the basis of its declared political, economic and social principles, policies and programmes.

All political parties, seeking mass support, need to be cohesive; this requires internal unity and

loyalty. To attain their objectives, they need to be effective; problems and conflicts have to be

internally resolved. These are features common to all groups."

Thus the misgivings raised against the Petitioner on the grounds of indisCipline and

disloyalty were not sought to be removed or explained at the inquiry that the party had

instituted for the vindication of the innocence of the Petitioner. Therefore we take the

view that both procedurally and on the merits the decision taken by the rst Respondent

to expel the Petitioner from the party is beyond reproach and impugnation.

Thus we determine that this application ought to be rejected and notice is accordingly

refused.
