JUDGMENT

P Padman Surasena 1 (PICA)

Learned counsel for the 1st Party Petitioner Appellant agreed when this

case came up on 2017-07-28 before us, to rely fully on his written

submissions. He requested this Court to pronounce the judgment after

considering the written submissions. Therefore this judgment would be

based on the material adduced in the pleadings and written submissions.

The Officer in Charge of Police Station, Welipenna filed an information in

terms of section 66 (1) (a) in the Primary Court of Mathugama reporting

that a dispute between the 2nd party Petitioner - Appellant (hereinafter

referred to as the Appellant) and the 1st party Respondent - Respondent

(hereinafter referred to as the Respondent) pertaining to a road way had

arisen and that dispute would result in a breach of peace.

Learned Primary Court Judge after inquiry pronounced his order on 2010-

02-22 holding that the Respondent was entitled to use the disputed right of

way.

The Appellant thereafter made an application for revision to the Provincial

High Court of the Western Province holden at Kalutara against the order of

the learned Magistrate.

Perusal of the judgment dated 2011-09-26 pronounced by the learned

Provincial High Court Judge shows that the Appellant has failed to serve

copies of the documents produced marked P 2, P 3, P 4, P 5, P 6 and P 7

on the Respondent.

It appears that the Appellant has not explained as to why he could not

provide the above material along with his application. He has neither

. ;

5

undertaken nor sought leave of Court to tender the said documents even

at a subsequent occasion. Admittedly learned Primary Court Judge had

considered these documents when he made the impugned order.

Thus, it is clear that the Respondent has had no opportunity of considering

these documents in order to formulate arguments in preparation of their

case.

In addition to the above ground the learned Provincial High Court Judge

has also held that there is no exceptional circumstance to invoke the

revisionary jurisdiction of the Provincial High Court.

It is appropriate at this juncture to turn to the rules relevant to this issue.

Rule 3 (1) (a)l states as follows:

Every application made to the Court of Appeal for the exercise of the

powers vested in the Court of Appeal by Articles 140 or 141 of the

Constitution shall be by way of petition, together with an affidavit in

support of the averments therein, and shall be accompanied by the

originals of documents material to such application (or duly certified copies

thereof) in the form of exhibits. Where a petitioner is unable to tender any

lCourt of Appeal (Appellate Procedure) Rules 1990

6

such document, he shall state the reason for such inability and seek the

leave of the Court to furnish such documents later. Where a petitioner fails

to comply with the provisions of this rule the Court may, ex mere mortu or

at the instance of any party, dismiss such application.

(b) Every application by way of revision or restitutio in intergrum under

Article 138 of the constitution shall be made in like manner together with

copies of the relevant proceedings (including pleadings and documents

produced), in the Court of First Instance, tribunal or other institution to

which such application relates ............. "

"

(13) It shall be the duty of the petitioner to take such steps as may be

necessary to ensure the prompt service of notice, and to prosecute his

application with due diligence.

Learned Provincial High Court Judge has referred to the case of Kiriwanthe

and another Vs Nawarathne and another2.

2 1990 (2) S L R 393

7

This case was decided on then applicable rule 46 of the Supreme Court

Rules of 1978. One has to be mindful of the fact that this rule3 did not

specifically provide for dismissal for non-observance and therefore has no

direct application to the instant case in which the issue is a question of

interpretation of Rule 3(1) (a)4 where it has specifically provided that the

Court may, ex mere mortu or at the instance of any party, dismiss such

application Where a petitioner fails to comply with the provisions of this

rule.

In the case of Shanmugawadivu Vs Kulathilakes the Supreme court has

held as follows " ....... the new Rules permit an applicant to file documents

later, if he has stated his inability in filing the relevant documents along

with his application, and had taken steps to seek the leave of the Court to

furnish such documents. In such circumstances, the only kind of discretion

that could be exercised by Court is to see whether and how much time

could be permitted for the filing of papers in due course.

3 Rule 46 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1978.

4 Court of Appeal (Appellate procedure) Rules 1990 52003 (1) S L R 216

,

8

Our courts have consistently held that the compliance of these rules are

mandatory. There is no acceptable reason as to why the Appellant could

not have complied with this rule at the proper time.

The relevant documents have been considered by the learned Primary

Court Judge and hence is very much material for the maintainability of this

revision application.

In these circumstances, we see no reason to interfere with the findings of

the learned High Court Judge. Thus, we decide that this appeal should

stand dismissed.
