Argued & Decided: 09.10.2018

Mahinda Samayawardhena, J.

The respondent-petitioner-petitioner (petitioner) has filed this

appeal with leave obtained from the previous Bench against the

order of the Board of Quazis dated 28.10.2017 whereby (whilst

notice being issued on the substantive application on the

respondent) the ex parte application made seeking a direction to

the Quazi Court to recall the enforcement certificate sent to the

Magistrates Court until the determination of the substantive

application was refused. This appeal is against the refusal of the

said interim order.

The substantive application is against the order of the Quazi Court

dated 06.04.2017 directing the petitioner to pay maintenance to

the child whose paternity is, according to the learned counsel for

the petitioner, denied by the petitioner. That is a matter to be

decided on evidence by the Quazi Court and irrelevant for the

present appeal.

Learned counsel for the petitioner says that the order of the Quazi

Court dated 06.04.2017 was made ex parte and therefore until a

proper inquiry is held, the Board of Quazis should have made the

interim order.

3

As the Board of Quazis in the impugned order has observed, if the

order was made ex parte, the petitioner could have availed himself

of the proviso to section 66 of the Muslim Marriage & Divorce Act

to reopen the proceedings before the Quazi Court. Learned

counsel for the petitioner admits that no such application was

made before the Magistrates Court up to now.

As seen from the journal entry dated 21.09.2017 of the

Magistrates Court proceedings, the petitioner had on that day

appeared before the Magistrates Court for the first time on

summons. He had been represented by a lawyer as well. However

as the respondent was not physically present although represented

by a lawyer, the Court has warned the petitioner to appear on

12.10.2017 to work out a modality of payment of maintenance

when the respondent is present.

Thereafter, according to the petitioner himself, on 12.10.2017 he

has paid Rs. 50,000/= as maintenance and the case has been

postponed to 15.11.2017 to make the balance payment. Learned

counsel for the petitioner says that the said payment of Rs.

50,000/= was made out of fear of getting a default (custodial)

sentence. I cannot accept that submission at all (a) having regard

to the manner the learned Magistrate has dealt with the petitioner

when he first appeared on 12.10.2017 and (b) in the absence of a

copy of the proceedings dated 15.11.2017. The proceedings dated

15.11.2017 has not been tendered to the Board of Quazis and the

Board of Quazis has made a particular reference to that matter in

the order. The petitioner does not tender a copy of the said

proceedings to this Court either. The inference which could be

drawn is that the petitioner does so because those proceedings are

unfavorable to him.

4

The petitioner has gone before the Board of Quazis in between

12.10.2017 (the date of the first payment of Rs.50,000/=) and

15.11.2017 (the date of the balance payment)to be exact on

24.10.2017, and made the said application ex parte, which was

rightly refused by the Board of Quazis.

The order of the Board of Quazis is a perfect order. There is

absolutely no merit in this appeal.

Appeal is dismissed with costs which I fix at Rs.50,000/=.
