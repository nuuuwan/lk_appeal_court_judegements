Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioner has filed this application, seeking inter alia the following relief:

a) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision in 'pg,l to remove the Petitioner

from the post of Head, Department of Languages and Communication

Studies, Eastern University, Sri Lanka;

b) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the decision in 'pg' to place the Petitioner

under interdiction;

c) A Writ of Certiorari to quash the charge sheet 'pl0' issued under the

signature of the 2nd Respondent.

When this matter was mentioned on 3rd September 2018, the learned Counsel

for the Petitioner informed this Court that the Petitioner would only be seeking

the reliefs prayed for in paragraphs (b) and (d) of the prayer, namely the Writ

of Certiorari to quash the decision reflected in 'pg' to remove the Petitioner

from the post of Head, Department of Languages and Communication Studies

and the Writ of Certiorari to quash the charge sheet marked 'pl0' issued under

the hand of the 2nd Respondent. The Petitioner has subsequently filed a motion

on 13th September 2018 informing Court that he would only be pursuing the

Writ of Certiorari to quash the charge sheet marked 'pl0'.

The facts which are relevant to a consideration of the above reliefs are .briefly

as follows.

1 'pg' is an extract of the minutes of the 266th meeting of the Council of the 1st Respondent University held on 25th June 2016 where the said decision was taken.

4

The Petitioner had been appointed to the post of Lecturer (Probationary) by

the 1st Respondent Eastern University on 3rd January 2000 and had

subsequently been promoted to the post of Lecturer (Grade II) in 2006.

Pursuant to a decision taken by the Council of the 1st Respondent at its

meeting held on 28th November 2015, the Petitioner had been promoted to

the post of Senior Lecturer (Grade I), with effect from 2ih May 2012.

By letter dated 23rd October 2015 annexed to the petition marked 'p2', the

Petitioner had been informed that the Council of the 1st Respondent University

had appointed the Petitioner as the Head of the Department of Languages and

Communication Studies, with effect from 1st November 2015, in terms of

Section 51(1) of the Universities Act No. 16 of 1978, as amended.

By letter dated 1st June 2016 annexed to the petition marked 'p4', the

Petitioner and several other lecturers of the 1st Respondent had complained to

the 2nd Respondent Vice Chancellor of certain incidents of ragging and student

unrest that had taken place at the Trincomalee campus of the 1st Respondent

University and had sought a meeting to discuss the situation prevailing at the

campus. The Petitioner and the said lecturers had thereafter met the 3rd

Respondent, the Rector of the Trincomalee Campus of the 1st Respondent

University on 2nd June 2016 and 3rd June 2016.

Pursuant to the said meetings, by letter dated 3rd June 2016 annexed to the

petition marked 'P7', the 3rd Respondent had complained to the 2nd

Respondent about the conduct of the Petitioner at the said meetings. The 3rd

Respondent had also submitted a formal complaint dated 22 nd June 2016

5

annexed to the petition marked (PSI to the Chairman of the Council of the 1st

Respondentl in which he had reiterated his complaint on the conduct of the

Petitioner and other lecturersl at the meetings held on 2nd and 3rd June 2016.

The 5th Respondent Deputy Vice Chancellor of the 1st Respondent had visited

the Trincomalee campus on 3rd June 2016 to discuss the issues that had arisen

at the said Campus and had submitted his report dated 10th June 20161 which

has been annexed to the petition marked (PSI. In the said reportl the 5th

Respondent had drawn the attention of the 2nd Respondent tOo the manner in

which the staff of the Department of Languages and Communication Studiesl

including the Petitionerl had spoken at the said meetingl calling it distressing

and difficult to tolerate.

The lapses in the due administration of the Trincomalee campus and the lack

of co-operation of the academic staff in maintaining discipline at the Campus

had been discussed at the 266th meeting of the Council of the 1st Respondent

held on 25th June 2016. An extract of the minutes of the said meeting had been

annexed to the petitionl marked (pgl. The Council had noted the contents of

the documents (PSI and (PSI and arrived at the conclusion that the Petitioner is

(disturbing the administration and the harmony of the communities at the

Trincomalee Campus at largel Based on the said reports l the Council had taken

inter alia the following decisionsl in respect of the Petitioner:

"That disciplinary action be taken immediately on her in the larger

interest of the Campus and the following course of action be taken in this

respect:

6

Remove her from the position of the Head of Department with

immediate effect;

Interdict her from the post of Senior Lecturer Grade I immediately;

Institute disciplinary inquiry against her on the complaints."

Accordingly, the 2nd Respondent had conveyed to the Petitioner the above

decision of the Council of the 1st Respondent by his letter dated 25th June 2016

annexed to the petition marked (P9A' and the Petitioner had been placed

under interdiction with immediate effect.

By letter dated 18th July 2016 annexed to the petition marked (Pl0', the

Petitioner had been requested to show cause with regard to six charges

mentioned therein, which the Petitioner had done by her letter of the same

date. This application was filed while the inquiry against the Petitioner was

proceeding on the charges set out in (Pl0'.

According to the Petitioner, the Inquiry Officer had exonerated her of all

charges. Pursuant to the receipt of the report of the Inquiry Officer, the

Council of the 1st Respondent had decided to reinstate the Petitioner in service

and by letter dated 5th October 2017 produced by the Respondents marked

(R9', the 2nd Respondent had informed the Petitioner that the Council has

decided to end the suspension with effect from October 9, 2017. The

Petitioner had accordingly assumed duties as Senior Lecturer (Grade I) with

immediate effect.

7

The only matter that the Petitioner is now agitating before this Court is the

decision of the Council to issue the charge sheet to the Petitioner, with the

Petitioner alleging that the said decision is illegal and liable to be quashed by a

Writ of Certiorari.

The learned Senior State Counsel submitted that the power of this Court to

issue Writs conferred by Article 140 of the Constitution is discretionary in

nature and would not be exercised where it would be futile to do so. It has

been held in a long series of cases2 and recently by the Supreme Court in

Samastha Lanka Nidahas Grama Niladhari Sangamaya vs Dissanayake3 that

no court will issue a mandate in the nature of Writ of Certiorari or Mandamus

where to do so would be vexatious or futile. In the present application,

pursuant to the issuing of the charge sheet, the Petitioner had submitted her

response, a formal disciplinary inquiry has been held, and the Petitioner has

been exonerated and reinstated in the same post that she held prior to the

issuance of the charge sheet.

Thus, even if this Court accepts the position of the Petitioner that the issuance

of the charge sheet was illegal, quashing the charge sheet at this stage would

be futile as the Petitioner has been reinstated in service. In these

circumstances, this Court is of the view that it would not be lawful for this

Court to intervene in this situation at this stage.

However, for the purpose of completeness and as the Petitioner has referred

this Court to the judgment of the Supreme Court in University of Ruhuna and

others vs Dr. Dharshana Wickremasinghe4, this Court has decided to examine

the two grounds relied upon by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner in

support of his argument that the issuing of the charge sheet was illegal.

In the said case, the Supreme Court has held that the charge sheet must be

approved by the Council of the University. The Supreme Court has held further

that the participation of the husband of the person who made the allegations

against the petitioner in that case, at meetings of the council where decisions

were taken to initiate disciplinary action against the petitioner, was sufficient

to raise a suspicion that there was real likelihood of bias.

The first ground urged by the learned Counsel for the Petitioner is that the

charge sheet has not been approved by the Council and therefore, the charge

sheet is liable to be quashed. It would be appropriate at this stage to examine

the position taken up by the Petitioner in the petition. In paragraph 24 of the

petition, it is stated that, Ion 2sth June 2016, the Governing Council of the 1st

Respondent had decided to ... conduct a disciplinary inquiry against her on six

specific charges' and that, 'on 18th July 2016, the 2nd Respondent issued the

charge sheet with six charges'.

In paragraph 2S(ii) of the petition, the Petitioner has stated as follows:

'it was revealed at the said inquiry that:

4 SC Appeal No. 111/2010 SC Minutes of 9th December 2016.

9

(ii) although the Governing Council has framed certain charges (Le. 1st,

3rd, 5th and the 6th charges) which had no basis as no one had made such

complaints to the 2nd Respondent or the Council as per the minutes of the

said meeting of the Council tendered to the subsequent meeting of the

said Council held in July 2016;

(iii}The 2nd Respondent had proceeded to issue the said charge sheet

against the Petitioner even prior to confirmation of the minutes of the

previous meeting of the Council and the answer submitted by the

Petitioner was not tabled before the CounciL's

Thus, the position taken up in the petition was that the Council had decided to

conduct an inquiry on six specific charges and that the Council has framed the

charges. In this background, there was no necessity for the Respondents to

provide material to substantiate that the charge sheet had been approved by

the Council. The argument that was presented by the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner during oral submissions, that the Council has not approved the

charge sheet, has been taken up for the first time in the counter affidavit filed

in December 2017, by which time the Petitioner had been reinstated. This

Court is of the view that the Petitioner cannot be permitted to raise in her

counter affidavit, issues which had not been raised in the petition, as the

Respondents have no opportunity of answering such matters and would

therefore prejudice the Respondents.

5 The Petitioner has not referred to any provision of the law which requires confirmation.

10

This position was considered by this Court in Wasana Trading Lanka (Pvt)

limited vs Dr. Sarath Amunugama and others6 where Sripavan, J (as he then

was) held as follows:

"The Court is of the view that the Petitioner cannot set up a new case in his

counter objections which was not the subject matter in his original petition

dated 4th November 2004. It is not open to a petitioner in an application for

Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus to present a case not set out in the petition

or obtain reliefs on a basis not averred in the petition."

For these reasons, this Court sees no merit in this argument and rejects the

first ground urged on behalf of the Petitioner.

The second ground urged on behalf of the Petitioner is that the participation of

the 3rd and 5th Respondents at the Council meeting held on 25th June 2016,

where the decisions reflected in 'pg' were taken, is contrary to the principles

of natural justice. While the 5th Respondent had admitted during his evidence

at the disCiplinary inquiry that he participated at the Council meeting held on

25th June 2016, the Petitioner's position that the 3rd and 5th Respondents were

present at the time the said decision was taken has been denied by the

Respondents, whose denial has not been contradicted in the Counter affidavit

of the Petitioner. While a complete set of minutes of the said meeting has not

been submitted by either party, the Petitioner has not sought an order from

this Court directing the Respondents to tender a list of those present when the

decision in lpg' was taken nor has the Petitioner filed such a list with her

counter affidavit. In the absence of any material to substantiate the argument

11

of the Petitioner, this Court is not in a position to make a determination on this

ground urged by the Petitioner.

In these circumstances, this Court sees no legal basis to issue the Writ of

Certiorari prayed for. This application is accordingly dismissed, without costs.
