Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner company filed this application against the 1st

respondent-Habaraduwa Pradeshiya Sabha and the 2nd

respondent-its Secretary seeking (a) to quash by certiorari the

resolution passed by the Finance and Policy Committee of the 1st

respondent as evidenced by the Gazette marked P36 and (b) to

compel the respondents by mandamus to issue the trade licence

to the petitioner for the year 2016 to operate their hotel.

By the said resolution, the Pradeshiya Shabha was empowered

to levy a trade licence fee for the year 2016 at the rate of 1% of

its takings of the previous year from a hotel registered with the

Sri Lanka Tourist Board. The petitioners hotel is one such

hotel.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner contends that

the said resolution is ultra vires on two grounds:

(a) In terms of section 147(1) read with sections 149 and

12(1) of the Pradeshiya Sabha Act, No.15 of 1987, as

amended, only the Pradeshiya Sabha is empowered to

impose trade licence fees, and the Finance and Policy

Committee of the Pradeshiya Sabha has no authority

to do so.

(b) In any event, the said Finance and Policy Committee

of the Pradeshiya Sabha has not been properly

constituted as mandated by section 12(1) of the Act.

The composition of the relevant Finance and Policy Committee,

as seen from R3, has not been decided by the respondents, but

by the Commissioner of the Local Government (Southern

Province). The 2nd respondent has merely carried out that order.

3

However, the Commissioner of the Local Government (Southern

Province) has not been made a party to this application.

In the same breath, if the contention of the petitioner is that the

decision of the Finance and Policy Committee is ultra vires, the

members of the said Committee shall be made parties to this

application. This has not been done.

In Wijeratne (Commissioner of Motor Traffic) v. Ven. Dr. Paragoda

Wimalawansa Thero [2011] 2 Sri LR 258 at 267 the Supreme

Court held that:

The first rule regarding the necessary parties to an

application for a writ of certiorari is that the person or

authority whose decision or exercise of power is sought to

be quashed should be made a respondent to the

application. If it is a body of persons whose decision or

exercise of power is sought to be quashed each of the

persons constituting such body who took part in taking the

impugned decision or the exercise of power should be made

respondent. The failure to make him or them respondents to

the application is fatal and provides in itself a ground for

the dismissal of the application in limine.

If the act sought to be impugned had been done by one

party on a direction given by another party who has power

granted by law to give such direction, the party who had

given the direction is also a necessary party and the failure

to make such party a respondent is fatal to the validity of

the application.

4

Hence, in my view, the application of the petitioner is liable to be

dismissed in limine on the failure to make necessary parties as

respondents to this application.

Without prejudice to the above, let me now consider the merits

of the application.

It is common ground that by the time the said resolution was

adopted the Pradeshiya Shabha seized to exist by operation of

law as the term of the Pradeshiya Shabha had expired. In such

circumstances, what happens to the day to day affairs of the

Pradeshiya Sabha? Section 9(3) of the Act provides the answer.

The short answer is that the 2nd respondent-Secretary to the

Pradeshiya Sabha shall take over. Section 9(3) reads as follows:

Where a Pradeshiya Sabha is unable to discharge its

functions by reason of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman

ceasing to hold office, the Secretary shall, during any period

that elapses between the occurrence of the vacancies in

respect of those offices and the filling of those vacancies in

accordance with the provisions of the Local Authorities

Elections Ordinance, have, exercise, perform and discharge

all the rights, privileges, powers, duties and functions

vested in or conferred or imposed on, the Pradeshiya

Sabha, the Chairman or Vice-Chairman by this Act or by

any other written law.

Then it is clear that the 2nd respondent Secretary had the

authority to decide trade licence fees.

The learned Presidents Counsel for the petitioner drawing

attention of Court to section 12(1) of the Act, which inter alia

says that the Pradeshiya Sabha cannot delegate its powers to

5

raise any loan, to levy any rate or to impose any tax to the

Committees, submits that the decision taken by the Finance and

Policy Committee to impose trade licence fees is therefore ultra

vires.

The learned counsel for the respondents drawing attention to

documents marked R4A, R4B, R5 submits that the Committee

made only a recommendation but the ultimate decision was

taken by the 2nd respondent Secretary. The learned counsel

further submits that there was no delegation of power to the

Committee to impose trade licence fees.

Be that as it may, the petitioner concedes that the Pradeshiya

Sabha has the authority to decide trade licence fees. As the

Pradeshiya Sabha was non-existent by operation of law, it is

now clear that the Secretary could take that decision. If the

Secretary took that decision alone, there could not have been

any objection.

According to the second proviso to section 149 of the Act, a

Pradeshiya Sabha is empowered to levy a trade licence fee from

a hotel registered with the Sri Lanka Tourist Board at the rate of

1% of its takings of the previous year. Therefore, the impugned

decision is not an arbitrary one but mere implementation of the

said provision of the Act.

The argument of the petitioner is that the decision was taken not

by the Secretary, but by the Committee. Who comprised of that

Committee? As per R3 and the second page of R5, it was

comprised of six members, of which the 2nd respondent

Secretary was the head or at least a member. Then it is clear

that the 2nd respondent Secretary has taken the decision along

6

with five others. It is my considered view that the fact that five

others also took the same decision does not make the decision of

the 2nd respondent Secretary invalid. The decision of the 2nd

respondent is not ultra vires.

It is a prerequisite to pay the trade licence fee to issue the trade

licence. Hence this Court cannot compel the respondents by

mandamus to issue the trade licence without such payment

being made and other requirements if any being satisfied.

I dismiss the application of the petitioner with costs.
