Samayawardhena, J.

The petitioner, graduate teacher, was granted full pay study leave

initially from 01.02.1991-01.02.1994 and then from 02.02.1994-

31.01.1995 to complete his PhD. The thesis submitted by him was

rejected by the University. Thereafter the respondents decided to

recover the salary paid to the petitioner during that period. The

petitioner has filed this application seeking to quash that decision

by way of writ of certiorari.

Paragraphs 14:4 (Chapter XII) and 4:12 (Chapter XV) of the

Establishment Code provide as follows:

14:4 An officer who is granted full pay study leave should be

required to enter into an Agreement before he is allowed to proceed

on leave.

3

4:12 The form of Agreement and Bond to be used is set out in

Appendices 8 (Agreement) and 15 (Bond).

The petitioner has tendered a specimen of the said Agreement

marked P2 and a copy of the signed Bond marked P3.

According to paragraph (I) at page 2 of the Bond P3, unless the

course of study to which paid leave was granted is completed to

the satisfaction of the 1st respondent, the petitioner shall

reimburse the money paid to him during the said period.

It is the submission of counsel for the respondents that when the

petitioner failed to successfully complete the degree, for the

successful completion of which full pay leave was granted, the 1st

respondent is entitled to direct the petitioner to reimburse the

money in terms of the above condition.

Referring to the said condition in the Bond, counsel for the

petitioner on the other hand states that "completion of the course of

study for which full pay study leave was granted" shall be taken to

mean "to attend lectures and complete the course work" only, as

awarding the PhD to the thesis submitted by the petitioner is a

matter for the University and not for the respondents.1

In the completion of PhD, there are absolutely no lectures to attend

and no course work to follow. All what a PhD student shall do is to

submit the thesis at the end of his research. The thesis submitted

by the petitioner has been rejected by the University as it is not up

to the standard to be awarded a PhD.

The government paid full pay study leave during his study and if

he was unsuccessful in his studies, the 1st respondent as per the

Bond is in my view entitled to come to the conclusion that the

course of study for which full pay study leave was granted was not

completed to his satisfaction and therefore the grantee shall

reimburse the money paid to him by the government.

No room shall be left to misuse the privileges granted to public

officers by the Establishment Code such as granting long term paid

study leave for the successful completion of postgraduate studies

for the greater benefit of the public service.

The decision taken by the respondents is in my view not illegal,

irrational or improper.

In any event, certiorari is a discretionary remedy. It cannot be

sought as of right. Even assuming without conceding that the

decision sought to be challenged is illegal, irrational or improper, if

the other circumstances do not warrant granting the relief, the

Court can refuse the relief.

In this matter, the petitioner being a government teacher, apart

from taking full pay three year study leave, and then one year

study leave, which ended on 31.01.1995, has repeatedly taken

excessive leave thereafter. For instance, as per paragraph 14(x) of

the statement of objections of the 1st and 2nd respondents, the

petitioner has reported to work for only 23 days in the year 1996

after taking study leave for four long years. That example shows

his commitment to his noble profession.

The amount to be recovered is another factor which the Court can

take into account. As I understand, according to paragraph

14(xxii) of the statement of objections, as the petitioner has now

5

retired, only a sum of Rs. 56,156/72 could now be recovered from

the petitioner out of his pension.

Application of the petitioner is dismissed but without costs.
