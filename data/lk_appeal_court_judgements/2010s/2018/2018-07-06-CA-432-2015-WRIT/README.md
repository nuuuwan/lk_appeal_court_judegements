Samayawardhena, J.

The two petitioners are traders. They along with other traders

have been carrying on business of selling items in the old shopping

complex targeting devotees visiting Sellakatharagama until they

were shifted to the new shopping complex. On their choice, in the

new shopping complex, the petitioners have got shops in front of

the entrance to the Sellakatharagama main Devalaya.

The possession of the shops has been handed over to them in

December 2011, and in the same month, the 1st respondent UDA,

according to the petitioners, has put up a concrete layer along the

boundary of the new complex and erected a small bund on top of it

leaving two small entrance points to the complex from Devalaya

side, and thereafter erected an iron fence next to the bund leaving

only two entrance gates obstructing free access from the Devalaya

side to the new shopping complex whilst leaving an unobstructed

free access from the Buttala-Kataragama main road.

Thereafter hawkers, according to the petitioners, have put up

unauthorised structures along the iron fence and started business

aiming at the devotees.

In a case filed in the Magistrate's Court of Tissamaharama, No. BR

31338/15, the Magistrate's Court has ordered to remove the said

unauthorised traders, but according to the petitioners this order

has not been fully implemented by the relevant authorities

including the 1st respondent.

Then in the year 2014, the petitioners say, the 1st respondent

erected flower shops along the road leading to the Devalaya.

The petitioners state that these things taken cumulatively caused

great financial loss to them due to devotees not patronizing their

shops in the new shopping complex.

The gravamen of the complaint of the petitioners is that the

respondents breached the legitimate expectation of the petitioners

that their potential customers would have undisrupted access to

their shops from the Devalaya side, and the 1st respondent would

make constructions according to Plan P4 where there is no

indication of putting up of an iron fence along the boundary of the

shopping complex, which prevented free access by the devotees to

the petitioners shops.

In that backdrop, the petitioners seek mandates in the nature of

writ of mandamus directing the 1st-3rd respondents (a) to remove

the unauthorised traders and their unauthorised structures in

terms of the order of Magistrate's Court of Tissamaharama referred

to above (b) to remove the iron fence erected around the new

shopping complex contrary to Ground Plan P4 released prior to

leasing out the new shopping complex and (c) to restore the

entrance to the Sellakatharagama new shopping complex from the

Devalaya side to have free access to the shopping complex.

I have no hesitation to conclude that no mandamus can be issued

on the above grounds.

It is elementary that the petitioner must show that he has a legal

right to the performance of a legal duty by the party against whom

mandamus is sought. Mandamus is not intended to create a right

but to restore a party who has been denied his legal right.

Housing Development Authority2, Wannigama v. Incorporated

Council of Legal Education3, Janak Housing (Pvt) Ltd v. UDA4, Credit

Information Bureau of Sri Lanka v. Messrs Jafferriee & Jafferjee

(Pvt) Ltd5) The petitioner manifestly fails in this requirement.

On the other hand, the petitioners cannot say that they had a

legitimate expectation that no fence would be erected along the

boundary of the shopping complex from the Devalaya side.

The alleged legitimate expectation is basically founded upon Plan

P4. P4 is not a complete Plan, and, in any event, it is, at best, not

a Ground Plan as the petitioners seem to suggest, but a Building

Plan. In a Building Plan boundaries are not shown.

It is highly unreasonable to claim that the authorities shall not put

up a fence along the boundary of the new shopping complex as it is

disadvantageous in terms of profits for some shop owners

including the two petitioners.

If the authorities have not carried out the Magistrate's Court order

in relation to evacuating the unauthorised hawkers, the petitioners

can inform it to the Magistrate's Court which made the order and

take appropriate steps.

Application of the petitioners is dismissed with costs.
