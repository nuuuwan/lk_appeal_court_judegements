ORDER

P Pad man Surasena J

The Respondent Petitioner - Petitioner (hereinafter sometimes referred to

as the Petitioner) had filed the instant revision application before the

Provincial High Court of Central Province holden in Kandy seeking a

revision of the order dated 2015-05-29 made by the Primary Court of

Kandy. Perusal of the journal entries of the record of the Provincial High

Court shows that the said revislon application had first been called before

court on 2015-08-03. The said journal entries show that the Provincial High

Court had afforded an opportunity for the applicant - Respondent -

Respondent (hereinafter sometimes referred to as the 1st Respondent) to

file objections also.

When the case was called on 2015-11-26 learned Provincial High Court

Judge has fixed the case for 2016-01-19. This appears to be for the parties

to tender written submissions.

When the case was called on 2016-01-19 learned Provincial High Court

Judge had again fixed the case for 2016-02-23 for written submissions.

I .. 4

The journal entry number 08 dated 2016-01-20 shows that both the

Petitioner and the 1st Respondent had filed their respective written

submissions.

The journal entry number 09 dated 2016-02-23 shows that this case has

been called before court on that day. However, while the journal entry

dated 2016-01-19 states that the case was fixed for 2016-02-23, the typed

proceedings of the same date shows that the case was fixed for 2016-02-

25. Therefore, the position of the Petitioner that the case was fixed for

2016-02-25 cannot be rejected. If that is the case, there is no reason or

basis for court to call this case on the date it had dismissed it.

The journal entry dated 2016-02-23 is to the following effect

"... Petitioner not present

Counsel not present

Petition dismissed ... "

Journal entry number 10 and 11 dated 2016-03-11 and 2016-03-17

respectively shows that an attorney at law on behalf of the Petitioner had

supported an application for relisting. However learned Provincial High

Court Judge has not allowed the said application. Petitioner has filed this

application before this court seeking the intervention of this court having

the said order dated 2016-03-17 made by the learned Provincial High Court

Judge revised.

The purpose as to why this case has come up before the Provincial High

Court is for the parties to file their written submissions. As has been

5

mentioned before, both parties by that time had filed their written

submissions in the registry of the Provincial High Court. This Fact had been

recorded on the previous journal entry, which is journal entry number 08

dated 2016-01-20, which was available for the perusal for the Provincial

High Court judge when she made the impugned order on 2016-02-23.

It is the observation of this court that the dismissal was not the only option

that the learned Provincial High Court Judge has had on 2016-02-23. She

should have fixed the case for the argument as the written submissions

buy both parties have been filed by that time.

Even if one assumes that the action of dismissal by the learned Provincial

High Court judge is justifiable on the basis that neither the Petitioner or the

counsel was present at court on that day learned Provincial High Court

Judge has failed to give any reason as to why she did not allow the

application by the Petitioner to have this case relisted. Her order only

contains the words "~G<3C) qt)e66 e'2510G'<;@. ~G<3 9l53ZS)G'~a 2m6@."

Indeed this is the order that is being canvassed by the Petitioner before

this court.

Thus, this Court is of the opinion that the said orders made by the learned

Provincial High Court Judge are not appropriate orders.

Therefore, this Court decides to set aside the order dated 2016-03-17 and

the order dated 2016-02-23 made by the learned Provincial High Court

Judge.

6

This court directs the learned Provincial High Court Judge to restore this

application in the pending list of its cases and proceed with the case

according to law.
