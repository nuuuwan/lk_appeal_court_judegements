Arjuna Obeyesekere, J

The Petitioners have filed this application seeking Writs of Certiorari to quash:

a) Letter dated 21st December 2015, annexed to the petition marked 'Pll';

and

b) Letter dated 19th January 2016, annexed to the petition marked 'p12',

by which the 1st Petitioner has been asked to pay a sum of Rs. 4,233,060 being

the aggregate of the arrears of the Employees Provident Fund contributions

due to the employees of the 2nd Petitioner and a surcharge of 50% on such

arrears.

When this matter was supported on 25th July 2018, the learned Counsel for the

Petitioner submitted that the 1st Respondent Commissioner General of Labour

has not provided, either with 'Pll' or 'P12', details of the employees in respect

of whom the said EPF payments are due or the period in respect of which such

payments are due. He submitted further that providing such details is

mandatory in terms of Section 38(2) of the Employees Provident Fund Act\ as

amended and drew the attention of this Court to the judgment of the Supreme

1 Section 38(2) of the Employees Provident Fund Act reads as follows: "Where an employer makes default in the payment of any sum which he is liable to pay under this Act and the Commissioner is of the opinion that it is impracticable or inexpedient to recover that sum under section 17 or under subsection (1) of this section or where the full amount due has not been recovered by seizure and sale, then, he may issue a certificate containing particulars of the sum so due and the name and place of residence of the defaulting employer, to the Magistrate having jurisdiction in the division in which the place of work .... is situate."

Court- in City Carriers ltd vs The Attorney General2 and Mohamed Ameer and

another vs Yapa, Assistant Commissioner of Labour3, in support of his

argument. It was also submitted on behalf of the Petitioners that this was the

only ground that he would be agitating in seeking the Writs of Certiorari to

quash(Pll' and (P12'.

The learned Senior State Counsel denied the aforementioned position of the

Petitioners and stated that the relevant details have been provided to the

Petitioners. The Court directed the learned Senior State Counsel to file limited

statement of objections, together with documents in support of her position,

only on this issue. Accordingly, a comprehensive statement of objections of the

Respondents has been filed on 12th September 2018, together with documents

marked (lRl' - (lR21'. This Court must note that even though the Petitioner

was afforded an opportunity of filing a counter affidavit, the Petitioner has

failed to do so. The learned Counsel for the Petitioner has instead filed Written

Submissions, which do not address the matters raised in the limited statement

of objections of the Respondents.

In keeping with the reasoning of the aforementioned judgments that

particulars of the amounts due should be made available to the employer, this

Court would now examine the purported complaint of the Petitioners.

2 1992 (2) Sri LR 258 where the Supreme Court held that, Section 38(2) of the Employees Provident Fund Act, No. 16 of 1958 as amended imposes the duty on the Commissioner of Labour to give particulars of the sum due in the Certificate he files in the Magistrate's Court for recovery of Provident Fund dues. Where the certificate contains no particulars of the sum claimed, there is in law no certificate.

3 1998 (1) Sri LR 156.

The 1st Petitioner is the sole proprietor of the 2nd Petitioner, which is engaged

in the provision of janitorial and cleaning services. The Petitioners state that

they provided janitorial services to the University of Ruhuna, for which

purpose they employed male and female janitors and supervisors.

According to the Respondents, a complaint has been received on 5th July 2010

that the Petitioners have not remitted the EPF contributions of its employees.

An investigation has been launched in this regard by the Department of Labour

and by letter marked 'lR3', the 1st Petitioner had been asked t~ call over on 2nd

October 2010 with details that the Petitioners were required to maintain in

terms of the Wages Board Ordinance No. 27 of 19414, the Shop and Office

Employees Act No. 19 of 19545 and the Employees Provident Fund Act No. 15

of 19586

The 1st Petitioner has failed to present himself at the said meeting as well as

failed to submit the documents called for by 'lR3', inspite of several

reminders7. On 9th March 2011, the Administrative Officer of the Petitioner had

tendered to the Department of Labour the list of employees, marked 'lRS' and

'lRSa'. As the Petitioners did not provide the salary particulars relating to

these employees and as the employees in question had been used for

providing janitorial services at the University of Ruhuna8, the Department of

4 Pay sheets, attendance records and leave taken by the employees.

5 Pay sheets, attendance records and leave taken by the employees.

6 The 'e' forms by which EPF payments have been remitted to the Central Bank and the receipts issued by the Central Bank.

7 The reminders are dated 26th October 2010, lSth December 2010 and 29th December 2010 and have been marked as 'lR4A', 'lRSA' and 'lRSB', respectively.

8 According to the document annexed to the petition, marked 'P' which is the bid submitted by the Petitioner to the University of Ruhuna for the provision of janitorial services, the Petitioner had proposed to the University of Ruhuna to use 30 employees for the Faculty of Engineering complex at Hapugalle, Galle, 32 employees at the Faculty of Medicine Complex at Karapitiya, Galle and 70

j I I

Labour had called for and obtained salary particulars from the University of

Ruhuna.

The Department of Labour had thereafter calculated the EPF contributions due

for each employee based on the names of the employees provided by the

Petitioner and the salary details provided by the University of Ruhuna. A copy

of the said calculation sheets have been tendered by the Respondent, marked

'lRllB'. This Court has examined 'lRllB' and notes that details tabulated

under the name of the employee, the period of service, the salary paid, the EPF

contribution that should be remitted and the surcharge have been set out in

'lRllB'. It is the position of the Respondents that 'lRllB' had been

dispatched to the Petitioners, under registered cover together with the letter

marked 'Pll,.9

The failure on the part of the Petitioners to file a counter affidavit and

contradict the above position of the Respondents that all particulars of the

sum so due were in fact provided to the Petitioners, demonstrates to this

Court that the Petitioners have no explanation to offer to the documents

submitted by the learned Senior State Counsel. This Court is satisfied with the

manner in which the calculation of the amounts due as EPF contributions has

been carried out by the Respondents and accepts the submission of the

learned Senior State Counsel that the Respondents have in fact provided to the

Petitioner the particulars of the sum so due. In these circumstances, it is clear

to this Court that the Petitioners have suppressed the fact that the relevant

employees at the Main complex at Wellamadama, Matara. Payment was to be at the rate of Rs. 516 per day for male labourers and Rs. 449 per day for female labourers, and included the contribution that was to be made towards the EPF.

9 The registered receipt article in proof thereof has been produced, marked as 'lRllC' and 'lRllD'.

9

particulars were given with 'Pll' and that the Petitioners have attempted to

mislead this Court.

This Court is also in agreement with the submission of the learned Senior State

Counsel that 'Pll' and 'P12' are not certificates filed in the Magistrate's Court

but are documents by which the Petitioners have been notified that

proceedings would be instituted, if the sums of money set out therein are not

paid. Therefore, the provisions of Section 38(2) of the Act would not apply to

'Pll' and 'P12'. In this background, it is not difficult for this Court to conclude

that the Petitioners have presented this application with the clear intention of

misleading this Court to believe that 'Pll' and 'P12' attract the provisions of

Section 38(2) of the Act. Once confronted by the Respondents, the Petitioners

have chosen to remain silent on this issue, as well.

In these circumstances, this Court does not see any merit in the argument of

the Petitioners that particulars of the sum due were not given with 'Pll' or

that 'Pll' and 'P12' are illegal or ultra vires the provisions of Section 38(2) of

the Act.

The Petitioners have further stated in their petition that they were not given

the opportunity of submitting documents and challenging the quantification of

the amount due as EPF arrears. However, the documents furnished by the

Respondents make it clear that the said position of the Petitioners is factually

incorrect as the Commissioner of Labour has given the Petitioners the

opportunity of providing the required documents on multiple occasions, as

borne out by the documents marked 'lR4A', 'lRSA', 'lRSB' and '1R13'lo. In

10 'lR13' is dated 4th July 2016, which is after 'Pll' and 'P12'.

10

these circumstances, this Court is satisfied that the Petitioners have been given

every opportunity of contradicting the details in (Pll' and (P12' but that they

have not availed themselves of such opportunity.

It is also clear from the documents produced by the Respondents marked

(lR14A', (lR14B', (lR1SA' - (lR1SC', (lR16A' - (lR16C', (lR17A', (lR17B',

(lR18A', (lR18B', (lR19A', (lR19B' and (lR20,1l that the Petitioners have failed

to provide the material requested and have not co-operated with the

Department of Labour. What is most significant is that the Petitioners have not

produced a single document to demonstrate that they have in fact remitted

the EPF contributions of the employees. It is clear from the conduct of the

Petitioners that they have acted with the sole intention of obstructing

regulatory action being taken against them by the Department of Labour. The

Petitioners have therefore not only suppressed from this Court the above

events that transpired after (P12' was sent in January 2016, but attempted to

mislead this Court by stating that the Department of Labour had not given the

Petitioners any opportunity of defending themselves.

Our Courts have consistently held that a party invoking the Writ jurisdiction of

this Court must come with clean hands and utmost good faith. The Supreme

Court in Liyanage & another v Ratnasiri, Divisional Secretary, Gampaha &

Others12 citing the case of Jayasinghe v National Institute of Fisheries and

Nautical Engineering and Others13 has held as follows:

11 These letters have been sent between August 2016 and November 2017. 12 2013 (1) Sri LR 6 at page 15. 13 2002 (1) Sri LR 277.

11

liThe conduct of the Petitioner in withholding these material facts from

Court shows a lack of uberrima fides on the part of the Petitioner. When a

litigant makes an application to this Court seeking relief, he enters into a

contractual obligation with the Court. This contractual relationship

requires the Petitioner to disclose all material facts correctly and frankly.

This is a duty cast on any litigant seeking relief from Court.

In Timberlake International Pvt. Ltd. Vs. The Conservator General of

Forests14, the Supreme Court, having held that the conduct of an applicant

seeking Writs of Certiorari and Mandamus is of great relevance because such

Writs, being prerogative remedies, are not issued as of right, and are

dependent on the discretion of court, stated as follows:

lilt is trite law that any person invoking the discretionary jurisdiction of

the Court of Appeal for obtaining prerogative relief, has a duty to show

uberrimae fides or (utmost) good faith, and disclose all material facts to

this Court to enable it to arrive at a correct adjudication on the issues

arising upon this application."

This Court therefore accepts the submission of the learned Senior State

Counsel that the Petitioners have suppressed material facts from this Court as

well as misrepresented material facts to this Court. Thus, this application is

liable to be dismissed in limine, on this basis alone.

The Respondents have also taken up the position that the Petitioners are .guilty

of laches in that this application has been filed over two years after 'Pll' and

14 s.c. Appeal No: 06/2008 SC Minutes of 2nd March 2010.

'p12' were sent. This Court observes that the Petitioners have not explained

the reasons for their delay and that on this ground too, this application is liable

to be dismissed.

In the above circumstances, this Court does not see any legal basis to issue

notices on the Respondents and accordingly dismisses this application. Taking

into consideration the fact that the Petitioners are guilty of suppression and

misrepresentation of material facts, this Court directs the Petitioners to pay

the State a sum of Rs. 50,000 as costs.
