B

ya plaint dated 3rd March 1994 the Plaintiff~Respondents (hereinafter sometimes

referred to as "the Plaintiffs") instituted this action seeking inter alia a declaration

of title to the land known as "Pokunehena alias Thimbirigahamulawatta" more fully

described in the Schedule to the plaint, ejectment of the Defendant~ Appellant

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as "the Defendant") and all those holding under him

and recovery of possession of the land in question.

The case of the Plaintiffs~a father (lst Plaintiff) and son (2nd Plaintiff) who were

designated as the 1st Plaintiff and 2nd Plaintiff went as follows:~

The 1st Plaintiff and the sole Defendant in the case were Siblings whose father

(henceforth known as Pina) first made a gift of the land in question to the Defendant by

a Deed bearing No. 4892 and dated 02nd August 1978. The Plaintiffs averred that there

was a change of heart in the pater familias who later revoked the deed of gift by a deed of

revocation bearing No.200and dated 9th June 1983. On the same day namely 9th June

1983 as the deed of revocation was executed, and hot on its heels the old manexecuted

another deed in favour of the 1st Plaintiff and 2nd Plaintiff, which gave them title. This

new deed bears the No.20l on which the Plaintiffs founded their action. The plaint

further averred that the Defendant, being a brother of the 1st Plaintiff, was let into the

subject~matter after the death of the father on 04th July 1986 with the leave and licence

of the Plaintiffs and though he had been requested to hand over possession, he refused

to do so and thus the cause of action was premised on a declaration of title and

ejectment.

2

The Defendant traversing the averments in the plaint demurred in his answer and

stated that the revocation of the deed of gift in his favour and the deed of transfer in

favour of the Plaintiffs were fraudulently effected. His allegation is that the Plaintiffs

entered the land forcibly after the father had passed away in 1986 and disturbed his

possession. The Defendant sought a dismissal of the action instituted by the Plaintiffs.

The learned Additional District Judge of Kuliyapitiya found for the Plaintiffs by his

judgment dated 29th February 2000 and his conclusion is that the deeds of revocation

and transfer which both took place on 09.06.1983 had been duly executed. The learned

Additional District Judge also concluded that Pina~the father of the 1st Plaintiff and

Defendant, had been subject to Kandyan law, though his reasoning is sparse on the

matter.

The only issue, as the Counsel for the Defendant~ Appellant quite succinctly put it at

the hearing, is whether the father's revocation of the deed of gift (Pina's act of

revocation) is valid and effectual in view of the argument that the father (Pina) has not

been proved to be a Kandyan. In other words the argument of the learned Counsel for

the Defendant~Appellant is that there is no sufficient proof of the fact before Court that

the father Pina was subject to Kandyan law and therefore his revocation of the deed of

gift on 09.06.1983 was not legally effective to give validity to the subsequent deed in

favour of the Plaintiffs.

Let me put in a nutshell the three jural relations that are brought out by the acts of

Pina~the father of the 1st Plaintiff and Defendant.

1. The father Pina executed a deed of gift bearing No. 4892 dated 02.08.1978 (VI) in

favour of his younger son (the Defendant).

2. 5 years later on 09.06.1983 the donor (Pina) revoked the aforesaid deed of gift by a

deed of revocation bearing No. 200 (PI)

3. On the same day namely 09.06.1983 Pina transferred the land by a deed of transfer

bearing No. 201 to his elder son 1st Plaintiff and grandson 2nd Plaintiff (P2).

3

As I said before, it is the 2nd transaction~the deed of revocation that was impugned

before this Court. Laconically put, the argument was that Pina was not established by

evidence to be a person subject to Kandyan law and therefore he could not have validly

revoked the deed of gift in favour of the Defendant. Upon a careful consideration of the

totality of evidence in the case I find that the Defendant had confirmed in his cross~

examination that PI (the deed of revocation) contained his father'S signature. The

attesting witnesses to the deed also gave evidence and attested to the fact that it was

Pina (the father) who signed the deed of revocation and the deed of transfer in the same

breath. Thus the Defendant himself disproved his allegation in his issues that the deeds

of revocation and transfer were fraudulent, leave alone the evidence of the witnesses

who established the due execution of the deeds.

Thus the only mode of attack by the Defendant~Appellant in this appeal was based on

the personal law of Pina. The argument was mounted before this Court that Pina was

not a person subject to Kandyan law and therefore he would not enjoy the power of a

unilateral revocation of the deed of donation which he had made in favour of the

Defendant.

The liberality of revocation of deeds of donation that prevails in Kandyan law has an

interesting genesis and I think it appropriate to set it down here though the issue

before me is whether the Plaintiffs proved on evidence that Pina was subject to

Kandyan law. Before I come to that dispositive issue in the case, let me allude to the

right of a donor to revoke his deed of gift in Kandyan law.

Revocability of Deeds of Gift in Kandyan Law

As doubts arose on account of some decisions of the Supreme Court with regard to the

exceptions to the general rule that the Kandyan Deeds of Gifts are revocable, the

Kandyan Law Codification Commission was appointed in 1927. This Commission

recommended in its Report for 'a legislation containing a clause renouncing the right to

revoke in explicit terms and according to a form prescribed, which is the need to

minimize the evils of litigation and to give a certain amount of security and stability to

4

titles derived by Deeds of Gift'. The Commissioners stated that, "we believe that these

recommendations if given legislative force will, while preserving the spirit of the

ancient law on the subject, remove certain hardships which are experienced by

donees".

Based on this Report, the Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Ordinance No. 39

of 1938 was enacted. With regard to revocation of gifts, subsections (1) and (2) of

Section 4 of the Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Ordinance No.39 of 1938

become pertinent:-

4(1)

4(2)

"subject to the provisions and exceptions hereinafter contained, a donor may, during his life

time and without the consent of the donee or of any other person, cancel or revoke in whole or

in part any gift, whether made before or after the commencement of this Ordinance, and such

gift and any instrument effecting the same shall thereupon become void and of no effect to the

extent set forth in the instrument of cancellation or revocation ..... "

No such cancellation or revocation of a gift effected after the commencement of this Ordinance

shall be of force or avail in law unless it shall be effected by an instrument in writing declaring

that such gift is cancelled or revoked and signed and executed by the donor or be some person

lawfully authorized by him in accordance with the provisions of the Prevention of Frauds

Ordinance or of the Deeds and Documents (Execution before Public Officers) Ordinance."

However, the following deeds of gift made after the commencement of this Ordinance

cannot be revoked.

(a) Gift to a temple

(b) Gift in consideration of a future marriage which takes place subsequently.

(c) Gift creating a charitable trust in terms of section 99 of the Trusts Ordinance.

(d) A gift, the cancellation of which is expressly renounced by the donor, either in

the same instrument or by a subsequent instrument by a declaration

5

containing the words "I renounce the right to revoke" or words of

substantially the same meaning or, if the language of the instrument be not

Sinhala, the equivalent of those words in the language of the instrument.

(Section 5(1) of the Ordinance).

For a renunciation of the right to revoke to become effective, the requirements are

contained in Section 5 (1) ( d):,

1. there must be a renunciation of the right to revoke,

2. which is express,

3. made by the donor in a declaration,

4. containing the words "I renounce the right to revoke" or words of substantially

the same meaning.

The following judgment went against the grain of the stipulation in Section 5 (1) (d) of

the Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Ordinance No.39 of 1938

Sansoni C.]. in the case of Punchi Banda v. Nagasena1 said,

"the question of the revocability of the deeds depends solely on whether the first clause of the

deeds already reproduced, satisfies the requirements of section 5(1)( d) of the Ordinance ... Now

the clause under consideration is nothing less than a declaration by the donor, expressed in the

first person, for he declares that he gives the property as a gift. He describes the gift as

"irrevocable", and the question that remains for consideration is whether, by the use of that

single word, he has expressly renounced the right to revoke. I can see no need for a separate

clause containing such a renunciation. ... .it is only a donor who has the right to revoke a gift.

When he declares that the gift is irrevocable, he is expressly renouncing that right."

The effect of this decision was that the use of the word "irrevocable" in a deed of gift

was sufficient to constitute an express renunciation of the right torevoke the gift There

was no need for a sentence "I renounce the right to revoke",words of substantially the

1 64 N.L.R. 548 6

same meaning. This judgment was overruled by the Privy Council in DuDewe v.

DuDewe2

In Ukku Banda v. Pauns Singho3 -a case decided before Kandyan Law Declaration and

Amendment Ordinance No.39 of 1938 was enacted, it was held that the words

"absolute and irrevocable" are an express and unmistakable renunciation of the right to

revoke. This would again not represent the correct law as was set down by the Privy

Council in DuDewe v. DuDewe (supra).

In Kumarihamy v. Banda4 it was held that where in a Kandyan deed of gift the donor

declares in the most clear language that the deed is irrevocable, there was a declaration

by the donor and that he is not entitled to go back on it. The words that had been used

in the deed were "by way of gift absolute and irrevocable under any circumstances

whatsoever hereafter .... ".

The above authorities would not represent the law in view of the decision in DuDewe

v. DuDewe (supra) which insists on a transitive verb to be used if the right to revoke a

previous deed of gift were to become effective. As would be seen, later cases in Sri

Lanka have affirmed the view of Dullewe (supra).

The paradigmatic case that appears to have marked a watershed in interpreting the

right to revoke given in the law (Sections 4 and 5 of Kandyan Law Declaration and

Amendment Ordinance No.39 of 1938) was DuDewe v. DuDewe5 in which the Privy

Council by a majority decision6 held that, "a Kandyan Deed of Gift is revocable unless

the right of revocation is expressly renounced in the particular manner stated in

Section 5(l)(d) of the Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Ordinance No.39 of

1938" The Privy Council drew attention toa further requirement that the renunciation

must be effected in a particular way videlicet by a declaration containing the words "I

renounce the right to revoke" or words of substantially the same meaning. In other

271 N.L.R 289.

327 N.L.R. 449 462 N.L.R. 68 571 N.L.R. 289

6See (1969) 2 A.C.313: (1969) 2 W.L.R 811 reported sub nom Duflewe (Tikkiri Banda) v Duflewe (Padma Rukmani) 7

words the renunciation of the inherent right to revoke must be couched in a sentence

with a transitive verb taking an object such as "renounce the right to revoke". There has

to be a declaration with a transitive verb. An adjectival clause such as "as a gift

irrevocable" will not suffice for purposes of the renunciation of the right to revoke a

Kandyan deed of gift. This is what the majority judgment of Lord Hodson advised Her

Majesty with Lord Guest, Lord Upjohn and Sir Thaddeus McCarthy in concurrence on

4th December 1968.

In this case Lord Donovan in a dissenting judgment stated that the Donor in the case

had expressly indicated that the lands were to be "a gift irrevocable" and therefore Lord

Donovan expressed the view that, "the words as a gift irrevocable' means 'not capable

of revocation'; and the capacity to revoke obviously depends upon the existence of a

right to do so ....... When, therefore, the donor uses a word which indicates that the gift

is not to be capable of revocation, he is saying that he shall not enjoy the right to revoke

which he would otherwise possess. In other words he is renouncing that right". For

Lord Donovan the words "as a gift irrevocable" are expressly sufficient to renounce the

existing right to revoke. Lord Donovan's dissenting judgment affirmed the decision in

Punchi Banda v. Nagasena (supra) which was though overruled by the majority

judgment.

There was support for the dissenting judgment of Lord Donovan in Dullewe (supra) and

this support could be seen in the Court of Appeal judgment of P.D. Ratnayake v.

M5.Bj Bandara/, where Seneviratne, J. (PICA) expressed the opinion that Lord

Donovan's view on revocability was correct. This was a case where the donation by a

Kandyan was expressed in the deed to be absolute and irrevocable. Despite this

formulation Seneviratne, J. opined that the donor could revoke the donation. This is

then a view which accords with the majority in Dullewe. Even so Seneviratne, J.

expressed a preference for the dissenting judgment of Lord Donovan in the following

tenor~ "after due consideration I agree with the dissenting judgment of Lord Donovan

and it is mainly to express this view that I have written a supplementary judgment.

71986 (1) Sri L.R 245 (CA)

However, this Court is bound by the majority judgment of the Privy Council in

Dullewe's case as it was at that time the supreme and final Court of Appeal".

However, leave was granted in this case by the Court of Appeal to appeal to the

Supreme Court on the substantial point of law, namely; whether the deed No.8247 (PI) was

revocable. When the case P.B. Ratnayake v. M5.BJ Bandara8 came up in appeal to the

Supreme Court, a Bench of nine Judges (Ranasinghe, C]., H.D. Tambiah,]., H.A. De

Silva, ]., G.P.S.De Silva, ]., Bandaranayake, ]., Mark Fernando, ]., Amerasinghe, ].,

Kulatunga,]. and Dheeraratne, ].) was constituted to look into the correctness of the

decision in Dullewe's case. Ranasinghe, C]. with whom H.A. De Silva,]., G.P.S. De Silva,

]. and Kulatunga,]. agreed held:~

"the Privy Council judgment in DuJJewe v. DuJJewe 71 N.LR 289 is not binding on the

Supreme Court. Though that judgment is of great value the question decided there is open to

review, and the dissenting judgment of Lord Donovan was the correct view on the subject."

But a majority of five judges (H.D. Tambiah,]., with Bandaranayake,]., Mark Fernando,

]., Amerasinghe,]. and Dheeraratne,]. agreeing) veered towards the majority judgment

of the Privy Council in Dullewe (supra).It was held by the majority judgment:~

"The Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Ordinance No.39 of 1938 is an Ordinance to

declare and amend the Kandyan Law. It seeks to amend the Kandyan Law and not to make a

mere statement of the law as it was prior to 1939 when the intention to renounce the right to

revoke was inferred or deduced from the particular words used. The amending Ordinance has

enacted a uniform rule requiring an express and not merely inferential renunciation of the right

of revocation The words 'expressly renounced' in s. 5(1) (d) of the Ordinance recognise a pre~

existing right to revoke which every Kandyan donor had in Kandyan Law. What the Ordinance

contemplates is an express and deliberate renunciation by the donor of his right to revoke. From

the words "absolute and irrevocable" it may be implied that the donor intendedto revoke

butsuch an expression would not constitute an express renunciation of the right to revoke.

81990 (1) Sri.LR 156 (SC)

There is a further requirement that the renunciation must be effected in a particular way, viz. by

a declaration containing the words "I renounce the right to revoke" or words of substantially the

same meaning.

The Ordinance by Section 5(1)(cI) has now vested in the Donor a statutory right to revoke and

he is required to exercise that right in a particular way.

The words "absolute and irrevocable" are only an adjectival description of the gift but the

essential requirement is a transitive verb of express renunciation Words merely of further

assurance are insufficient. "

The majority view endorses the Privy Council stipulation that the words "absolute and

irrevocable" are only an adjectival description of the right but the essential requirement

is a transitive verb of express renunciation. The majority judgment expressed that

requirement thus:-

"There is a further requirement that the renunciation must be effected in a particular way, viz.

by a declaration containing the words "I renounce the right to revoke" or words of

substantially the same meaning. The Ordinance by section 5 (1) (cI) has now vested in the

Donor a statutory right to revoke and he is reqUired to exercise that right in a particular way."

There have been subsequent decisions of our Courts which have confirmed the majority

judgment in Ratnayake v. Bandara (supra).

In the case of Somalatha and others v. Wickremasinghe and others,9 one R gifted

irrevocably the premises in dispute to one S, subject to the life interest of the donor's

wife. Subsequently, the donor revoked the said gift and the question was whether that

deed of gift was revocable. It was held that;

(1) Kandyan law gives the right to a donor without the consent of the donee or any

other person such as the life interest holder, to cancel or revoke any gift by an

instrument in writing in conformity with the law.

9(2002) 2 Sri.LR 347 10

(2) However, a gift to a temple, gift in consideration of marriage, gifts effecting a

charitable trust and gifts where the right to revoke is renounced under Section 5

(1)( d) are the exceptions, and

(3) Although the donor explained in the deed of gift that he was giving the gift

which was irrevocable and absolute under all circumstances, he did not say that

he was renouncing his right to revoke such an 'irrevocable and absolute' gift. The

section expected such renunciation in words similar to what is mentioned in

Section 5(1) (d), if a gift was to be considered as an exception to the general rule

of revocability of gifts under the Kandyan Law.

Thus Section 4(1) of the Kandyan Law Declaration and Amendment Ordinance No.39

of 1938 makes provisions for a revocation of a deed of gift by the donor during his

lifetime, without the consent of the donee or of any other person, in whole or in part of

any gift, whether it was made before or after the commencement of this Ordinance, and

such gift and any instrument effecting the same shall thereupon become void and of no

effect to the extent set forth in the instrument of cancellation or revocation.

As I said before, the method of revocation is provided for in subsection (2) of Section 4.

A revocation is valid only if it is effected by an instrument in writing declaring that the

gift is cancelled or revoked by the donor or by someone lawfully authorized by him in

accordance with the provisions of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance or of the Deeds

and Documents (Executed before Public Officers) Ordinance.

Sections 4 and 5 of this Ordinance obviously were intended to clarify and perhaps also

to simplify the law relating to the revocation of gifts made by persons governed by the

Kandyan law. Section 4 of the Ordinance confers on any donor an unrestricted right of

revocation of any gift, except those that are referred to in Section 5 which also

prescribes a formula to renounce the right to revoke.

Today there is no ambiguity on the right of a Kandyan donor to revoke his deed of gift

and the matter is settled that his right to revoke survives unless he has used a transitive

11

.:j

~enounce the right to revoke and therefore the donor Pina enjoyed an absolute right to

exercise of the right of reyocation of the deed of gift was the requirement that Pina was

~ ,I 'I a person subject to Kandyan law.

Was pjna a person subject to Kandyan law?

There is no discussion of this by the learned Additiopal District Judge though there

~. . Was ap. issuera-ised "by t~ Plaintiffs whethe-F-Pina-(~heJa~her'-{)f the pt Plaintiff and the

Defendant) was subject to Kandyan law and in answ~ring the issue in the affirmative

the learned Additional D,tstrict Judge stated that oral ?nd documentary testimony has

revealed that Pina was subject to Kandyan law. What was this oral testimony?

The items of evidence astta the assertion of Kandyan law rights on the part of Pina are

scattered in the appeal hrief. The pt Plaintiff quite categorically declares in evidence

that his father-Pina (the/donor of the deed bearing No. 4892 who later revoked this

i deed) was subject to Kan~yan law-seepage 1 of the proceedings dated 19.11.1997 ..

. . At page 17 of the proct:edings dated 23.09.1998 th~ Defendant also speaks to the

, territorial inhabitancy of his father Pina. The Defendant confirms in cross-examination

that Walapaluwa-the village where the father had ~resided lies in the District of

Kurunegala and generations of his clan had been long resident in this domicile.

~he provinces that are 'specified as Kandyan Provi~ces are given in Part I of the

Schedule to the KandyanMarriage and Divorce Act No 44 of 1952. They are:-

(1) The Central Province

(2) The North-Centr,a.l Province

(3) The Province of Uva

12

( 4) The Province of Sabragamuwa

The areas specified hereunder: ~

(1) Chinnacheddikulam East and West Korale and Kilakkumulai Korale in the

Vavuniya District, of the Northern Province.

(2) The Kurunegala District, and Demala Hathpattu in the Puttalam District, of the

North Western Province.

Both these items of evidence remains uncontradicted and there is no evidence in

rebuttal to show that Pina was not subject to Kandyan law~see the pronouncement of

H.N.G. Fernando, C.] (with Tambiah, J. and Siva Supramaniam, J. in concurrence) in

Edrick de Silva v. Chandradasa de silvio. That pronouncement which turns on the

quantum of proof would be to the effect that if the Plaintiff leads evidence and the

Defendant does not contradict it, that would be an additional "matter before Court,"

which the definition in Section 3 of the Evidence Ordinance requires the Court to take

into account. When the evidence transpired in the testimony of the 1st Plaintiff that his

father Pina who also fathered the Defendant was subject to Kandyan law, it was open to

the Defendant to have assailed and repudiated this fact. But the Defendant remained

silent on this assertion.

Silence amounting to an admission

There was not even a cross~examination of the tt Plaintiff on his testimony as to this

material fact. The fact that Pina should be a person subject to Kandyan law was an issue

raised by the Plaintiffs but the silence of the Defendant in the face of a positive

assertion by the tt Plaintiff that their father was subject to Kandyan law will

inferentially amount to an admission on the part of the Defendant. There was more

incentive for the Defendant to disprove this fact as his case for a dismissal of the

Plaintiffs' case depended on disproof of the assertion that Pina was subject to Kandyan

law. But the Defendant chose not to disprove it and I therefore I would take the view

that the Defendant's silence in Court would amount to an admission. Silence in court

10 70 N.L.R 169 at 174 13

may be used to strengthen inferences from opposing evidence~see a valuable article by

J.D. Heydon, Silence as evidence 1 Monash University Law Review 53 (1974).

Thus the evidence emanating from both the 1st Plaintiff and the Defendant himself in

cross~examination, gives credence to the probability that Pina~the donor of the deed of

gift was subject to Kandyan law, within the standard of proof stipulated for civil trials~

the preponderance of evidence or balance of probabilities.

Persons subject to Kandyan law

No doubt, there was no discussion by the learned Additional District Judge of

Kuliyapitiya on this matter and submission was made to the effect that the affirmative

answer to the issue whether Pina was subject to Kandyan was a bare answer that did

not comply with Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code. The proposition that a bare

answer to an issue will vitiate a judgment (see Warnakula v. Ramani Jayawardene

(1990) 1 Sri LR 206) is not an inflexible rule. Even if there is sparse discussion by

Original court judges but there is evidence to support the answer given to the issue,

that will amount to proof of the fact in issue. After all evidence is led to prove a fact in

issue. It is certainly a vice to routinely adopt evidence without discussion but it is not

so fundamental as to affect the judgment if there is evidence to support the issue. It is

open to the Court of Appeal to ascertain whether the conclusion of the District Court

on an issue is supportable having regard to the evidence. I take the view that the

learned Additional District Judge arrived at the correct conclusion that Pina was

subject to Kandyan law and there is evidential basis, as I pointed out above, to buttress

this conclusion.

In fact the Kandyan Succession Ordinancell, another legislative enactment dealing with

Kandyan law does indeed indirectly offer a definition of a Kandyan, although it does

not expressly seek to do so. This Ordinance determines the status of the children of

unions between Kandyan and non~Kandyans. The Ordinance does not use the term

Kandyan, instead, it refers "to a man (or a woman) subject to the Kandyan law and

11 No. 23 of 1917 14

domiciled in the Kandyan provinces." Hence by implication, the Ordinance appears to

define Kandyans as persons who were subject to Kandyan law and domiciled in the

Kandyan provinces. H.W. Tambiah (later a judge of the Supreme Court) commenting

on this Ordinance states: ~ 12

"This piece of legislation ...... does not settle the difficult and knotty point as to

who a Kandyan is. It leaves the definition of the word Kandyan at large. The

definition of a Kandyan as set out by this ordinance may be regarded as an

illustno obscurio obscurio."

The learned Author and Judge conveys the idea by way of the Latin dictum that the

illustrative definition in the Kandyan Succession Ordinance seeks to explain the

obscure by means of the more obscure~the concept is expressed in another Latin maxim

obscurium per obscunus.

But in fact in suggesting a definition in terms of domicile the formulation in Kandyan

Succession Ordinance was useful. The evidence that transpired in the case on long and

continuous residence in Walapaluwa on the part of generations of Pina is suggestive of

the fact that Pina was indeed subject to Kandyan law. Even the interpretation section of

the OrdinanceB supports this conclusion as it states that the term 'domiciled shall be

interpreted in the same manner as it would be interpreted if the Kandyan provinces

constituted a separate country'.

There is also a more helpful test emanating from K. Balasingham14 when he says that

families who have long lived rooted to the soil of any province where the Kandyan law

prevails, and speak the language, and follow the customs there prevailing may be

regarded as Kandyans. In offering this more practical test I must say that Balasingham's

test draws in aid the principle of inhabitancy. So when the 1st Plaintiff asserted that his

father was subject to Kandyan law and that evidence was not shaken a wee bit, the

12 H.W. Tambiah, J. Sinh ala laws and Customs. P 85.

13 Op.cit Section 4 (1).

14 Balasingham, The Laws of Ceylon, Volume 1, s 314, pp 205-206. 15

Defendant also confirmed that generations of Pina had lived rooted to Walapaluwa-an

area in the District of Kurunegala where Kandyan law prevailed.

So I take the view that Pina was a man subject to Kandyan law and it was within his

right to have exercised his right of revocation by VI and when he passed his title to the

Plaintiffs by the subsequent deed bearing No. 221 and dated 09.06.1983, the transfer

was validly and effectually executed. So the action for declaration of title was well

founded.

In the circumstances I see no reason to disturb the conclusions reached by the learned

Additional District Judge of Kuliyapitiya and I proceed to affirm the judgment dated 29th

February 2000. Thus the appeal of the Defendant-Appellant is dismissed.

JUDGE OF THE COURT OF APPEAL
