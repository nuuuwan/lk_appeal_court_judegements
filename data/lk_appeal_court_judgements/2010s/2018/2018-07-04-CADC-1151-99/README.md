S.N.Wijithsing for the Plaintiff-Respondent

Written submission filed on : Plaintiff Respondent filed on 27/02/2018

Decided on 29/06/2018

M. M. A. Gaffoor, J.

A preliminary objection was raised by the plaintiff -

respondent when this matter \vas taken up for argument. It was

submitted that the notice of appeal and the petition of appeal is

not signed by the Attorney-at-Law on record for the plaintiff -

appellant. Hence the argument was made that the appeal was

bad in law and should be dismissed.

According to the brief the notice of appeal has been filed by

S. B. Iddawela, Attorney-at-Law who was the Attorney on record

for the 1 st Defendant - Petitioner - Appellant (Page 105) and the

2

said S.B. Iddawela Attorney- at - Law has filed a proxy on behalf

of the 1 st Defendant - Petitioner- Appellant on 20/11/1991 and

taken all the steps in order to defend the 1 st defendant -

Petitioner - Appellant. But when the District Court matter was

concluded the petition of appeal was filed by one Mrs. Dharma

Thennakoon, Attorney- at- law. (Accordingly to (page 9) she has

filed a petition of appeal on 27/01/2000 without revoking the

proxy of this Attorney of the record.)

The plaintiff - respondent took up the preliminary objections

on the following basis :-

In terms of Section 775 (1) and 775 (3) of the Civil Procedure

Code the notice of appeal and the petition of appeal shall be

signed by the Registered Attorney and in the circumstances of

this case, the notice of appeal was signed by the Registered

Attorney on records but the petition of appeal had been filed by a

defendant Attorney without revoking the proxy of the Registered

Attorney (Who is not the Registered Attorney.)

Section 775 (1) states that "Every notice of appeal shall be

distinctly written on good and suitable paper and shall be signed

3

by the appellant or his Registered Attorney and shall be duly be

stamped. Such notice shall also contain following particulars .... "

Section 755 (3) read as "Every appellant shall within 60

days from the date of the judgment or decree appealed against,

present to the original Court, a petition of appeal setting out the

circumstances out of which the appeal arises and the grounds of

objection to the judgment or decree appealed against, and

containing the particulars required by the Section 758, which shall

be signed by the appellant or his Registered Attomey. Such

petition of appeal shall be exempt from stamp duty. The

determination of this objection requires an examination of the

procedure rules goveming the filing and revocation of proxy. In this

context it is important to bear in mind the following pronouncement

of A.R.B. Amaraginghe,J. in Fernando Vs. eibel Fernando

and other 1997 3 SIR page 01.

There is a substantive law and there is a procedural law.

Procedural law is not secondary. The maximum ubi ius ibi

remedium reflects the complimentary character of Civil Procedure

Law. The two branches are also interdependent. It is by

4

procedure that the law is put into motion, and it is procedural

law which puts life into substantive law, gives it remedy and

effectiveness and brings it into action.

Section 24 of the Civil Procedure Code permits a party to an

action to make or do certain appearances, and applications or

acts in any Court or any person, by his recognizes agent or by a

Registered Attorney duly appointed by the party.

Section 5 of the Civil Procedure Code defines a Registered

Attorney to mean an Attorney-at-Law appointed under chapter 5

by a party or his recognized agent to act on his behalf.

Section 27 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code requires the

appointment of Registered Attorney to be made in writing signed

by the client. There is no dispute between the parties that Mr.

S.B. Iddawela Attomey- at - Law has been appointed by the

plaintiff to be his Registered Attorney. According to a page 105 of

the brief indicate that the answer was filed along with the proxy

of Mr. S.B. Iddawela Attorney-at-Law on behalf of the 1st

defendant -petitioner-appellant.

5

The plaintiff-respondent's contention was that Sections 755

(1) and Section 755 (3) of the Civil Procedure Code the notice of

appeal and the petition of appeal shall be signed by the

Registered Attorney and in the circumstances in this case the

notice of appeal was signed by Attorney on record but petition of

appeal has been filed by a different Attorney called one Dharma

Thennakoon Attorney-at-Law, according to page 9 of the brief but

there is no revocation papers filed by the Registered Attorney.

Section 27 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code states that once a

proxy is filed, it shall be in force until revoked with the leave of

the Court and after notice to the Registered Attorney by a writing

signed by the client and filed in Court.

The case of Seelawathi Vs. Jayasighe 1986 3 C.L.R at

page 133 Hutchison C.J. .. it is a recognized principle in Court

proceedings that when there is an Attorney-at-law appointed by a

party such party must take all steps in the case though such

Attorney -at-Law.

6

In the case of Tilkaratne Vs. Wijesinghe 1986 3 CLR at page

133 Hutchinson held that "Section 27 of the Civil Procedure

Code is directly and this view is supported by a

Kadiragamadase Vs. Suppiah 56 N.L.R 172 and also

Jeevani Investment Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Wijesena Perera 2008 SLR

page 207 It was declared that " A final appeal commences with

the filing of notice of appeal and the petition of appeal in the

original Court by a Registered Attorney on record, appeal

proceedings in the Court of Appeal are continuation of the

proceedings commenced in the Original Court" and at page 209 it

was held by citing the Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Code that

"the proxy shall be in force until revoked it with the leave of

Court".

In the circumstances if this case it has not been revoked

and also the JA.N de Silva C.J. in S.P. Gunathilake Vs.

S.P.Ekanayake 2010 2 SLR at page 191 was concerned

whether the wording of Section 27 of Civil Procedure Code

permitted such a liberal construction.

7

Section 27 of the Civil Procedure Code clearly specifies the

manner in which a proxy it should be filed and revoked. It is the

duty of the Court to follow the Provisions of Section 27 (2) of the

Civil Procedure Code when revoking a proxy. Unless and until the

procedure is adhered to by Court, no proxy could be revoked. Till

then the proxy filed earlier proxy will in force.

Ran-Naid Vs. Wimlasooriya (CA. 1015/93) (F) CA.

Minutes of29/4/2014 and also observed in the case of Silva Vs.

Cumarathunga 40NLR page 139 a petition of appeal must be

signed by a Procter was proxy on record at the date on which the

petition is filed. It is true that the party dissatisfied with his

Registered Attorney is liberty to revoke the proxy and appoint

another Attorney-at- Law as his Registered Attorney but in

revoking the proxy the party has to follow the procedure

prescribe in Section 27 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code revocation

must be made with the leave of Court and after the notice to the

Registered Attorney. Wamigaratne Vs. Dissanayake 2002 2Sri

L.R. Page 331 the question when is whether the proxy of Mr. S.

B. Iddawela Attorney- at - Law was duly revoked. In this case

there is no application in writing signed by the plaintiff and filed

8

in court as required by Section 27 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.

Court did not have granted of leave for the revocation of the

proxy. Firstly there was no written application signed by the

plaintiff has required by section 27 (2) of the Civil Procedure

Code. In the case of Daniel Vs. Chandradeva 1994 2SLR Page

01 the Supreme Court emphasize the important of the

instructing Attorney revoking the proxy only after warning the

client and giving him a reasonable time to appoint another

Registered Attorney. In fact clear to the Civil Procedure Code

Amend Act No.8 of 2017, the Registered Attorney could not

initiate an application for revocation of proxy. It had to be done

by the client. The Court must have clear notice of Registered

Attorney appointed to look after the interest of a party. The Court

is also duty bound to ensure that leave to revoke a proxy is not

granted unless the client is fully aware of proposed revocation.

Whether an application for revocation of proxy should be allowed

or not is a matter of the discretion of Court. Fernando Vs.

Mathewa 15 NLR Page 88 in view the proposed Section 27(2) of

the Civil Procedure Code I am of the view the procedure set

therein is a mandatory nature.

9

Therefore, the petition of appeal filed by the Dharma

Thennakoon Attorney-at - law who is not the Attorney on record

was defective in terms of Section 755 (3) of the Civil Procedure

Code and therefore the reasons set out above, I uphold the

preliminary objection raised by the plaintiff-respondent and

dismiss the appeal. I make no order as to costs.
