No one wants to re- visit painful moments and keep detailed memories with them. We are also mindful most of our courts with due respect, are not child friendly. In this case a child giving evidence after 8 years and subjected to cross examination more than 3 years is sufficient to create certain contradictions in her testimony. It is human nature.
