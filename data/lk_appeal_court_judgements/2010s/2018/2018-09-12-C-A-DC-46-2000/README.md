This is an appeal filed by Plaintiff-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as the

Plaintiffs) against the Judgement dated 08.02.2000 of the Colombo District Court

in Case No. 17866/L. The Plaintiffs instituted the above numbered action in the

aforesaid District Court against the Defendant Respondent (hereinafter referred to

as the Defendant) seeking a declaration of title to the land and premises more fully

described in the second schedule to the Plaint and for ejectment of the Defendant

and all those holding under him from the said premises. The Plaintiffs pleaded that

the Defendant was in wrongful and unlawful occupation of the said premises from

01.10.1996 and further claimed damages at the rate of Rs. 5000/- per mensum

from that date until delivery of vacant possession of the same to the Plaintiffs.

The Defendant filed his answer denying the claims of the Plaintiffs and claimed

prescriptive title to the land in dispute. The Plaintiffs filed replication praying for

the dismissal of the Defendant's claim in reconvention. At the commencement of

the hearing parties admitted the jurisdiction of the court and issues numbered 1 to

3 were framed by the Plaintiff while the Defendant framed issues numbered 4 to

6. The 2nd and 3rd Plaintiffs testified in support of their case and document Pi to

P9 were marked and produced through them. The Defendant gave evidence on

behalf of himself.

P4 was tendered and marked subject to proof of a certified copy ("6e3 ~IDl5J2m

8De:l2S)l!:)) ooag 21BD ~D2SfE) cy~Be:l2Sf 21BD ctE)~6 e:l2S)@") - vide page 30 of the

proceedings dated 98.10.12. As per the aforesaid proceedings dated 98.10.12 it

appears P4 was so marked at the request of the Plaintiffs who wanted to mark that

document, but the proceedings do not reveal whether there was any objection to

the document by the Defendant. P6 and P7 too were marked subject to proof-

(vide pages 3 and 4 of the proceedings dated 09.03.1999). The Plaintiffs have

marked and tendered a certified copy of P4 as P4a without any objection. (vide

page 6 of the Proceedings dated 09.03.1999). However, as per the proceedings

dated 09.03.1999, at the end of the Plaintiffs' case, the Defendant has reiterated

his objection only for the documents marked P4 and P7. No objection seems to

have been reiterated for other documents, including P4a and P6 tendered by the

Plaintiff. Hence, as per the proceedings, the document marked Pi, P2, P3, P4a, PS,

P6, P8 and P9 have to be considered as evidence for all the purposes of the case.

(See Sri Lanka Ports Authority Vs Jugolinija Bold East (1981) 1 SLR 18)

The Defendant in his written submissions filed in the District Court had attempted

to submit that the proceedings at the closure of the Plaintiffs' case had to be

corrected, but, if the proceedings were wrongly typed he should have taken steps

to correct it with notice to the opposite party prior to the judgment. As both parties

have filed their written submissions before the learned District Judge on the same

date, the opposite party could not have any opportunity to reply to the allegation

that there were errors in the proceedings with regard to the reiteration of

5

objections at the end of the Plaintiffs' case. In such a situation this court sitting in

appeal cannot consider that there are uncorrected errors in the proceedings with

regard to the reiteration of objections at the closure of Plaintiffs' case. The learned

District Judge seems to have considered the correction suggested by the written

submissions of the defendant without giving an opportunity for the other side to

comment on that. Such an approach cannot be approved by this court. In such a

backdrop, this court has to consider that the Defendant reiterated his objections

only to documents marked P4 and P7 at the end of Plaintiffs' case as evidenced by

the proceedings. Since a certified copy of P4 has been marked as P4a without any

objection it becomes evidence for all purposes of this case. Thus, objections raised

against P4 becomes obsolete. On the other hand, as observed before in this

judgment there is no clear indication in the proceedings that even P4 was objected

to by the Defendant at the time it was marked and produced. Since objection to

P6 was not reiterated at the end of the Plaintiffs' case as evidenced by the

proceedings, this court has to consider that the objections to P6 was waived at the

closure of the Plaintiffs' case. It is clear from the proceedings that the objection to

P7 was reiterated, but as per the written submissions filed in this court by the

Defendant, his objections was not for the P7. On the other hand, since the

Defendant had admitted in evidence that the schedule to the Plaint describes the

land in dispute (vide proceedings dated 13.07.1999), proof of P7 is not necessary

for the success of the Plaintiffs' case if they can prove title to the land described in

the 2nd schedule to the Plaint.

It is clear that the land in the 2nd schedule to the Plaint is part of the bigger land

described in the pt schedule to the Plaint. As mentioned before, the Defendant

had admitted the boundaries described there in the schedule to the Plaint. It is

also admitted by the defendant that he came on to the said land as a tenant of

Buhari who is the Donor of Deed No. 88 dated 12.05.1967 marked as P6 by the

Plaintiffs. To prove their paper title the Plaintiffs have tendered deeds marked Pi,

P3, P4a and P6 but the stance taken by the Defendant was that he has prescriptive

title to the land in dispute. Since it is not in dispute that he came to the land in

dispute as a tenant, he cannot deny the title of the landlord or his successors in title

unless he proves an overt act and prescriptive possession from there onwards for

6

a period of ten years. The learned DistrictJudge has held that the Defendant failed

in proving prescriptive title. It is true that the Defendant did not file an appeal

against this decision. It may be for the reason that he is in possession and the

Plaintiffs' case too was dismissed causing no harm to his rights. However, it is the

duty of this court to see, in considering this Appeal filed by the Plaintiffs to see

whether the learned District Judge properly assessed the evidence led in this case

to come to the said decision of rejecting Defendant's claim.

The evidence led at the trial clearly shows that the Defendant was able to extract

sufficient material from the witnesses of the Plaintiffs through cross examination

to prove an overt act and prescriptive possession over 10 years.

The 2nd Plaintiff in his evidence at pages 5 and 6 of the Proceedings dated

12.10.1998 has stated as follows;

The above answers show that after about 6 months from the date the 2nd Plaintiff

got the deed in her name, she asked the Defendant to leave the premises, but he

stayed there stating that he is the owner without paying any rent to her. It seems

the Plaintiff also had to complain to the Police. This action was filed in the District

court only in 1997. The aforesaid incident of refusing the ownership of the 2nd

Plaintiff and the predecessors of the other Plaintiffs who got the title in 1983 from

the same deed should have taken place somewhere in 1984.

Even the 3rd Plaintiff has corroborated the above position in answering the

questions posed to her during cross examination in the following manner;

Even though the evidence of the Defendant standing alone is not strong enough to

prove adverse possession for more than 10 years from an overt act, the Defendant

as aforesaid has extracted evidence from the Plaintiffs' witnesses to prove adverse

possession for more than 10 years from an overt act. Thus, it is my considered view

that the learned District Judge erred in evaluating the facts revealed by the

Plaintiffs' witnesses in coming to the conclusion that the Defendant failed in

proving his case. When there is evidence from the plaintiffs' witnesses that the

defendant denied their title on a date which is 10 years before the date offiling the

plaint and continued to stay in the property in dispute without paying any rent or

accepting plaintiffs' title from that date onwards, the learned District judge cannot

come to any other conclusion except for holding in favour of the defendant. What

the Plaintiffs' witnesses admit need not be proved again by the Defendant.

For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the learned District Judge erred in holding

that the Defendant failed in proving his prescriptive title. Therefore, it is my view

that at the time of filing the Plaint, the Defendant had acquired Prescriptive title.
