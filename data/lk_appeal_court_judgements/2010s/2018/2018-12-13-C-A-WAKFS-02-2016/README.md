PLAINTIFF-RESPONDENT-

RESPONENT

4

Certain decisions of the Wakfs Board including an order of confirmation

and appointment of trustees of a Mosque are appealable to the Wakfs

Tribunal. The Members of the Tribunal are appointed by the Judicial

Service Commission. It is interesting to note that according to Section 9G

of the Act, the Tribunal is obliged to follow the procedure of a District

Court and is vested with the power to enforce its decisions as provided for

in the Civil Procedure Code. Every order made by the Tribunal shall be

deemed to be an order made by a District Court and the provisions of the

Civil Procedure Code governing appeals from orders and Judgments of a

District Court shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to and in relation to appeals

from orders of the Wakfs Tribunal (vide Salam, J. in CA/Wakfs/01/2011,

Court of Appeal minutes dated 26.06.2013). For the purposes of dealing with

offences of contempt against the authority of the Tribunal, the Provisions

of Section 55 of the Judicature Act, No. 2 of 1978, shall, mutatis mutandis,

apply as though the references therein to a District Court were references

to the Tribunal (vide Section 55A and 55B of the Act).

Having concisely referred to the duties and the conduct of the affairs of the

Board and the Tribunal, now I propose to set out the background to the

present appeal in detail.

The Plaintiff-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as the

Respondent) made an application before Wakfs Board in 2015, for

appointment of trustees to the Muhideen Mosque, Jaffna which

application was heard by the Wakfs Board in application bearing No.

WB/6743/2015, then Wakfs Board by its order dated 23.04.2015 decided to

appoint four persons as special trustees, two from each side, for the period

of three months, until the election of permanent trustees for the said

mosque. It is also seen from the documents which are contained in the case

record, this above order is mainly to constitute a pro tem - committee to

5

make preparations for the election of permanent trustees, as the period of

the incumbent trustees was elapsed in December, 2014.

Being aggrieved by the said order of the Wakfs Board, the Defendant-

Appellant-Appellants (hereinafter referred to as Appellants) filed an

appeal before the Wakfs Tribunal. In their petition of appeal, the

Appellants stated that after the expiry of their period in December 2014,

they had took all steps to hold the meeting of the jamath in contribution

with the Director of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs and they had

prepared the list of the members of jamath and announced the day for the

election of trustees in the mosque to be held on 25.04.2015. They further

stated that due to the Wakfs Board order dated 23.04.2015, the Respondent

above named became a member of the special committee who has to pay a

sum of Rs. 69,000/- as arrears of rent to the mosque. Therefore, the

Appellants submitted that if the Respondent or his nominees were

appointed as trustees to the said mosque, it will have serious negative

impact in the administration and management of the mosque. And they

were in a position that in any event, there were no valid reasons for the

appointment of special trustees when the Appellants have taken all

necessary steps to hold the election for the selection of trustees. On these

main grounds, the Appellants were urged the Wakfs Tribunal to set aside

the order of the Wakfs Board.

It is clear from the entire proceedings both in the Wakfs Board and

Tribunal, the Appellants were not objected to the formation of the

committee of selectors for the election of trustees; but they were strongly

objected to the nomination of the Respondent.

In the Wakfs Tribunal, after continuous deadlocks between the parties, on

19.03.2016, both parties had agreed to nominate five persons

independently, excluding the Appellants and Respondent and both parties

6

had asked to furnish the names of any suitable persons. Since the parties

had failed to give names of suitable persons as agreed, even after several

dates were granted thereto, the Wakfs Tribunal has moved for an action

that to send the Secretary of the Tribunal to the Mosque (Jaffna) and to

find some persons to be nominated into a committee to elect the trustees

by the jamath of the mosque. The said step finally occurred and the

Secretary gave the names of six persons who volunteered to be in the

committee, on 14.08.2016, the Secretary and the volunteer (committee)

members conducted an election by open vote and nine members were

confirmed as members of the election committee (vide pages 106-107, 48-49

of the Tribunals record); and those committee members were directed to

conduct an election to select the trustees and also directed not to allow the

parities to this case to be candidate for the election of trustees. After this

selection, the Wakfs tribunal by its judgment dated 20.08.2016 had directed

the Wakfs Board and the Director of Muslim Religious and Cultural

Affairs to confirm their appointment as trustees of the mosque for a period

of three years from 15.08.2016.

Being aggrieved by the said judgment (dated 20.08.2016) of the learned

chairman of the Wakfs Tribunal, the Appellants have preferred this instant

appeal to set aside the judgment.

In this appeal, the Appellants main averment was that,

When the settlement between the parties failed the Tribunal

adopted the unusual step of sending its Secretary to obtain names of

persons who would volunteer to function as members of an interim

committee.... This direction to have the Secretary to go to Jaffna was

a very unfortunate step taken by the Tribunal... (Emphasized

added, para 10 & 11 of the written submission made by the

Appellants).

7

In contrast, Counsel for the Respondent in their argument - citing several

judicial authorities and stated that the said order of the Wakfs Tribunal is

entered in result of a consent settlement; thereafter Appellants are not

entitle to resile the said settlement by the appeal.

After careful perusal of the entire proceedings and the judgment of the

learned Chairman of the Wakfs Tribunal, I am sure that the learned

Chairman was endeavored to settle the trustees issue and hold the

election of new trustees in a peaceful way. Even though, I need to evaluate

a fact that whether those endeavors done according to law and proper

procedures.

Wakfs Tribunals are established in terms of Section 9D (1) of the

Amendment Act No. 33 of 1982 where it is stated that the members of the

Tribunal shall be appointed by the Judicial Service Commission. Section

9G provides that in all proceedings under the Act the Tribunal shall follow

the procedure of a District Court. It is further provided that the Tribunal

shall have all the powers of a District Court as provided for in the Civil

Procedure Code in regard to the execution of orders and judgments.

Section 9G reads as follows:

In any proceedings under this Act, the Tribunal shall follow

the procedure of a District Court, and in the execution of its

orders and judgments, shall have all the powers of a District Court

and the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code, relating to the

procedures and powers of execution of a District Court, shall,

mutatis mutandis, apply to and in relation to the procedures and

powers of execution of the Tribunal.

8

Section 55A also introduced by the Amendment Act No. 33 of 1982 states

as follows:

Every order made by the Tribunal shall be deemed to be an order

made by a District Court and the provisions of the Civil Procedure

Code governing appeals from orders and judgments of a District

Court shall, mutatis mutandis, apply to and in relation to appeals

from orders of the Tribunal

(Vide, Halwan and others vs. Kaleelul Rahuman (2000) 3 SLR 50,

Rahuman and Two others vs. Trustees of the Mohideen Jumma Mosque

(2004) 2 SLR 250).

Therefore, it is crystal clear that according to Wakfs Act, the Tribunal must

follow the procedure of a District Court. And Tribunal may have all the

powers of a District Court as provided for in the Civil Procedure Code

with regard to the execution of orders and judgments.

In this case, the Wakfs Tribunal had moved for an action to send the

Secretary of the Tribunal to the Mosque (Jaffna) and to find some persons

to be nominated into a committee to elect the trustees by the jamath of the

mosque. It is quite clear that the Tribunal had acted with an unusual

practice which is not laid down by law.

It must always be remembered by adjudicators or judges that the judicial

system that prevails in many countries is confrontational and therefore the

jurisdiction of the judge is circumscribed and limited to the dispute

presented to him for adjudication by the law. Law does not in any way

permit the judges to go in to a deep voyage without their parameters and

make a finding as he pleases may be or what he thinks right or wrong.

9

The adjudicator or judge is always in a duty to determine the dispute

presented to him and this jurisdiction is circumscribed by that dispute and

no more.

According to Section 9H of the Act, the Tribunal have certain powers for

the purpose of hearing and determining any appeal made by this section.

For these purposes the Tribunal call the record of any proceedings before

the Wakfs Board and any documents in the possession of the board and

make such inquiries as may be necessary for the purpose of the appeal

and, if it thinks fit, to admit or call for any evidence, whether oral or

documentary. After hearing of an appeal, the Tribunal shall make order

confirming, setting aside or varying the order or decision of the board, or

make such other order thereon as it may think fit.

Further, according to Section 9E (1) of the Act, Wakfs Tribunal has been

given several (general) powers. The Section states as follows:

(1) The powers of the Tribunal under this Act shall include the power to hear and determine any application made in respect of a Muslim charitable trust or waifs for ah order providing for all or any of the following purposes:

(a) removing from office any trustee of the trust or waifs;

(b) appointing where necessary, a trustee or trustees for the trust or waifs ;

(c) directing the submission of statements of accounts to the Tribunal or the board;

10

(d) declaring what proportion of the property of the trust or waifs or of the interest therein shall be allocated to any specified object of the trust or waifs ;

(e) settling a scheme for the management of the trust or waifs;

(f) directing the specific performance of any act by the trustee or trustees of the trust of waifs;

(g) declaring any trustee of the trust or waifs guilty of any misfeasance, breach of trust or neglect of duty;

(h) ordering the payment by any trustee of the trust or waifs of any sum to the funds of the trust or waifs by way of damages in respect of any misfeasance, breach of trust or neglect of duty; and

(i) granting such further or other relief arising from the matters specified in paragraphs (a) to (h)...

In the light of the above mentioned provisions, it is further clear that, the

Wakfs Act has not grant any powers that to allow or urge the Wakfs

Tribunal to engage any officers in an internal affair of a trustee. The

Tribunal may direct and compel the parties to pursue necessary

procedures or mandates which are provide in the Wakfs Act.

In these circumstances, I hold that the Wakfs Tribunal has acted in ultra

vires - without proper authority to form a committee to select a new trustee

board.

11

I have seen from the proceedings in the Wakfs board and Tribunal that the

two parties were on continuous deadlocks and they were failed to settle

the issue to give their respective names as agreed to form a committee to

select a new trustee board; both parties had failed to reach a peaceful

settlement in terms of the directions from both Wakfs board and Tribunal.

These types of conducts and practices by trustees (who are engaged with

(holy) masjidh - works) cannot be condoned.

I do not ignore an important fact that, in the Wakfs Tribunal, both parties

had agreed to nominate five persons independently, but both parties had

failed to give their respective names of suitable persons as agreed to form

an independent committee to select a new trustee board to the mosque.

The learned Chairman also was enough lenient in granting several dates to

do the nomination thereto, even the parties failed to do so, therefore, the

learned Chairman decided to send the (without a proper legal authority)

Secretary of the Tribunal to the mosque Jaffna and find some suitable

persons to be nominated into a committee to elect the trustees.

Therefore, hereby, I set aside the judgment of the Wakfs Tribunal dated

20.08.2016, and direct the Wakfs Board to do the necessary arrangements

to re-appoint a special trustees from each side until the election of

permanent trustees for the mosque is held.

The both parties of this case are directed to ensure the peaceful selection of

such special and permanent trustees.

At this segment, I wish to extend my pen that a Masjidh, being the

exclusive abode of Allah on earth, deserves some high level of attention by

12

Muslims. The position enjoys by it requires that its managers must be

people of sound faith and high moral integrity. Allah (SWT) says:

"The Masajidh (mosques) of God shall be visited and maintained by

such who believe in God and the Last Day, establish regular

prayers, and practice regular charity, and fear none (at all) except

God. It is they who are expected to be on true guidance." (Chapter

09:18 in the Holy Quran)

Therefore, I also, direct the Wakfs Board to hold inquiries into the

allegations and complaint made against the respective persons in

accordance with proper procedures without delay.

The Registrar of this Court is directed to forward this case record with a

copy of this judgment to the Wakfs Board forthwith.

Appeal allowed.
