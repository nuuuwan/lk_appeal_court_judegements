The appellant, was indicted in the High Court of Colombo under

section 16 (b), and section 11 of the Bribery Act. After trial he was

convicted on all four charges.

The complainant in the High Court case is a businessman who's

nephew was arrested by the Ruwanwella Police with two motor bicycles

and a lorry in which the bikes were transported on suspicion of

possession of stolen property. The complainant Abuthahir has gone to

the police station to meet the OIC to get his nephew released. He has

met the appellant at the police station and was asked to produce the real

owners of the motor bikes along with the relevant documents. According

2

to the evidence of Abuthahir he has gone with the documents the next

day and several times thereafter to meet the appellant. But the suspect

was produced in court and was remanded. The appellant has called

Abuthahir to his side inside the court premises and indicated about the

need of a gratification. The appellant is alleged to have asked for Rs.

35,000/= to release the productions. The complainant has made a

complaint to the Bribery Commission thereafter, and a raid has been

organized for the orh of March. The complainant and the decoy P.C.

Hashan has gone to meet the appellant at the police station. After the

money was handed over to the appellant infront of the decoy the

appellant had moved away from them and subsequently he was arrested

by the Bribery Commission officers.

The learned President's Counsel for the appellant argued that

there are per-se and inter-se contradictions in the evidence of the

complainant and the decoy which the learned High Court Judge has

referred to in the judgment but has not clearly appreciated the vital

inconsistent positions, thus creating a failure of Justice to the appellant.

The appellanfs counsel stated that the prosecution failed to prove

beyond reasonable doubt that there was a solicitation by the appellant.

Therefore the appellant should have been acquitted.

The appellant's counsel stated that in evidence the complainant

has stated that the appellant the moment they met on the 07th asked him

about the money but the decoy did not say the appellant asked for the

money which is an important inter-se contradiction which the learned

High Court Judge did not consider which made him misdirect himself on

this facts. This can not be considered as a major issue on contradiction.

The decoy who is a police officer has given evidence after perusing his

notes whereas the complainant who is an uneducated person was giving

evidence by memory. The fact that the money was given to the appellant

and was taken by him remains as it is.

The position of the appellant was that the case was an introduction.

The appellant has given evidence to say that the money was put into his

trouser pocket from behind while he was walking. This as argued by the

respondent, is hard to believe. Will any sane person try to introduce a

bundle of currency notes into the pocket of a Police Inspector inside the

premises of a police station? A fabrication of evidence against an officer

inside the police station by the Bribery Commission officers is hard to

believe as well.

4

The grounds urged by the appellant in support of his appeal is not

credible. The learned High Court Judge has carefully analysed the

evidence place before him.

The judgments cited by the appellant Rex vs Gunathilake 51 NlR

302, Singho vs Werapitiya 55 NLR 155 and R VS Bellin 1966 1 AFR

522 with reference to the good character of the appellant is not relevant

to his arguments.

F or the afore stated reasons we decide to affirm the judgment

dated 06/10/2005 of the High Court of Colombo, and dismiss the appeal.

Appeal dismissed.
