ACHALA WENGAPPULI, J.

The Applicant-Respondent-Respondent (hereinafter referred to as

the "Respondent") made an application to the Magistrate's Court of Galle,

under Section 5 of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of

1979 as amended, seeking an order of ejection of the Resp0ndent-

Petitioner-Appellant (hereinafter referred to as the" Appellant") upon his

failure to quit from the land described in its schedule.

2

I

The appellant was noticed to show cause by the Magistrate's Court

and he tendered an affidavit annexed with documents marked R1 to R3. In

his show cause, the Appellant stated to Court that he is in possession of the

land upon title he inherited from his father. The Appellant further claims

that his father was conferred with title by its original owner one L.B.

Gunatilleke under whom his father was employed. In addition, he further

stated that the land is yet to be acquired by the State by placing reliance on

a plan No. GA/BPP /11/558 which was placed before by the Respondent

which has described the land in question as "q03t:S)6ml65 O~C5)) B>~

@G ~.B.(3). 1324 63 t:S)l@@ qot:S) 163 @t:S))oocl".

I,

Having considered the material placed before it, the Magistrate's

Court of Galle concluded that he has failed to satisfy Court that he has II a

valid permit or other written authority of the State granted in accordance

with any written law" and proceeded to issue order of ejection on

08.11.2012.

The Appellant thereafter invoked revisionary jurisdiction of the

Provincial High Court holden at Galle to set aside the said order of

ejection. After an inquiry the Provincial High Court refused the

Appellant's application to set aside the order of ejection and proceeded to

dismiss his petition.

3

------.-~ ..

Being aggrieved by the said order of dismissal, the Appellant now

invokes the appellate jurisdiction of this Court to set aside the order of the

Provincial High Court and in addition prays for an order directing a re-

inquiry into the question of ejectment.

In support of his appeal, the Appellant submitted to this Court that

the plan GA/BPP /11/558 clearly described the land as " q05t:D6(3)l&

C)~m) .)~ @~ ~.B.(3). 1324 &J t:Dl@(9 Got:D 163 @t:D)()wd" and that he

has clear title to the land he possessed well over 30 years, derived from his

paternal inheritance and the Court~ below has failed to consider this vital

I. information when making the respective orders. Based on these grounds

the Appellant contended that the land is not properly identified by the

Respondent.

Learned State Counsel in his submissions referred to the plan

GA/BPP /11/558 and invited attention of Court that it had been drawn in

September 2011 and under the column titled "ownership" it is clearly

stated as the "State".

The basis of the Appellant's submission is that the land in dispute is

not properly identified by the Respondent and that it is not State land as

he has independent title to it. If this submission is accepted then it places a

duty on the Magistrate's Court to inquire into the question whether the

4

, .

land in dispute is in fact a State land or not. Clearly the applicable relevant

statutory provisions do not support such a proposition.

Once an application is made to the Magistrate's Court by a

Competent Authority in compliance with the relevant statutory provisions

of the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Act No.7 of 1979, it has no

jurisdiction to inquire into the question whether the land in dispute is in

fact a State land or not. It has been held by this Court in Farook v

Gunewardene, Government Agent, Amparai(1980) 2 Sri L.R. 243 that;

"Section 9(2) is to the effect that the Magistrate cannot

call for any evidence from the Competent Authority in

support of the application under Section 5, which mean

the Magistrate cannot call upon the Competent

Authority to prove that the land described in the

schedule to the application is a State land (Section

5 (1)(a)(ii)). Therefore, the Petitioner will not have an

opportunity raising the question whether the land is a

State or private land before the Magistrate."

It was further held that the "structure of the act also make it appear that

where the Competent Authority had formed the opinion that any land is State

land, even the Magistrate is not competent to question his opinion."

Thus, it is clear that the both Courts have employed the relevant

statutory provisions in determining the dispute presented before them and

have arrived at legally valid determinations at the end.

5

" .

In view of this conclusion, we are unable to accept the validity of the

submission of the Appellant. Therefore, we affirm the orders made by both

Courts.

The appeal of the Appellant is accordingly dismissed without costs.
