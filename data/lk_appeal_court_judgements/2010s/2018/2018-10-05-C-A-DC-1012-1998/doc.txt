Samayawardhena, J.

This is a partition action.

The plaintiff and the 6th defendant have appealed against the

Judgment of the District Court.

The plaintiffs appeal (CA/1013/1998) has been abated.

The 6th defendant-appellants appeal is taken up for argument.

Learned counsel for the 6th defendant-appellant and learned

counsel for the 1st defendant-respondent were heard.

Insofar as the 6th defendants appeal is concerned, the 1st

defendant-respondent is not an affected party. The affected

party is the 9th defendant-respondent who is not before Court.

The 6th defendant has not been allocated any shares in the

Judgment.

The 6th defendant relies on two deeds to claim undivided rights

in the corpus.

The first deed is deed No.14014 marked at the trial 6V3. By this

deed Razeena Umma has transferred her undivided rights to the

6th defendant. The learned District Judge has accepted Razeena

Ummas undivided rights in the corpus, but refused to accept

that deed on the basis that it has been executed after the

institution of the action. Therefore, Razeena Ummas share has

been left unallotted.

Refusal to accept that deed, in my view, is not correct.

Partition case has originally been filed by plaint dated

29.12.1983 to partition a land in extent of 2 roods and 10

perches. Lis pendens in respect of that land has been registered

on or around 23.01.1984.

Thereafter, an amended plaint dated 14.06.1991 has been filed

by the 3rd defendant as the plaintiff to partition a larger land in

extent of 2 acres 1 rood and 21 perches, and lis pendens in

respect of the larger land has been registered on or around

07.06.1993.

The Court has thereafter proceeded to partition the larger land.

Notwithstanding the deed No.14014 has been executed after the

institution of the action, it has, in fact, been executed about 9

years before the correct lis pendens in respect of the larger land

was duly registered.

Section 66 of the Partition Law prohibits voluntary alienations

not after the partition action is instituted, but after the partition

action is duly registered as a lis pendens. (vide Dingiri

Mahathmaya v. Samaraweera [2003] 2 Sri LR 268) The learned

District Judge has failed to appreciate this difference.

The plaintiff in a partition case shall file the application for

registration of the action as a lis pendens with the plaint-vide

section 6 of the Partition Law; and summons will be issued on

the defendants only after the registration of the lis pendens-vide

section 13 of the Partition Law.

The deed marked 6V3 can be received in evidence.

4

Merely because this Court takes the view that deed marked 6V3

can be received in evidence, that does not mean that the

contents of that deed shall unequivocally be accepted by Court.

As stated in Cooray v. Wijesuriya (1958) 62 NLR 158: "Before a

Court can accept as correct a share which is stated in a deed to

belong to the vendor there must be clear and unequivocal proof of

how the vendor became entitled to that share."

Even though by 6V3 Razeena Umma has transferred undivided

1/8th share from the whole land to the 6th defendant, the learned

District Judge has decided that Razeena Umma is entitled to

48/1920 share from the whole land. Learned counsel for the 6th

defendant-appellant does not canvess that finding.

Therefore the 6th defendant shall be declared entitled to

undivided 48/1920 share from the corpus.

The next deed relied upon by the 6th defendant is deed No.14015

marked 6V5. By this deed Abdul Majeed has transferred some

undivided rights to the 6th defendant. This deed has been

rejected by the learned District Judge on two grounds: (a)

execution after the institution of the action and (b) on prior

registration.

The (a) above cannot be a ground for the rejection of this deed

(6V5) executed on the same day as 6V3.

However, rejection of that deed on (b) above is justifiable.

Abdul Majeed has earlier transferred his rights by deed marked

9V1 to the 9th defendant.

5

Learned counsel for the 6th defendant-appellant states that

although 9V1 has been executed before 6V5, 9V1 has not been

duly registered at the Land Registry.

However, upon perusal of the evidence of the 9th defendant and

the issues, it is clear that such a specific position has not been

taken up by the 6th defendant at the trial. 9V1 has not been

marked subject to proof. By looking at 9V1, which is a certified

copy of the deed issued by the Land Registry, this Court sitting

in appeal cannot decide whether or not it has properly been

registered. The 6th defendant should have put that matter in

issue at the trial Court. It is not a pure question of law, but a

question of mixed fact and law, and therefore cannot be raised

for the first time in appeal. (Leslin Jayasinghe v. Illangaratne

[2006] 2 Sri LR 39, Simon Fernando v. Bernadette Fernando

[2003] 2 Sri LR 158, Gunawardena v. Daraniyagala [2010] 1 Sri

LR 309, Somawathie v. Wilmon [2010] 1 Sri LR 128)

Hence I am not inclined to disturb the finding of the learned

District Judge on that point.

Appeal is partly allowed.

Let the parties bear their own costs.
