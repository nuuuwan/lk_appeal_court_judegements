Janak De Silva J.

The original Plaintiff (hereinafter referred to as "Plaintiff") filed the above action in the District

Court of Kegalle seeking to partition the land called Hitinawatta 15 lahas paddy sowing in extent

situated at Morawaka in the District of Kegalle.

The Plaintiff claimed that one Rankira was the original owner of the corpus. Upon his death his

rights devolved on his child Andirisa whose rights devolved on his child Podiya, the pt Defendant

in this case (hereinafter referred to as "pt Defendant"). Podiya sold Y2 of his share to Somapala

the Plaintiff by deed no. 856 dated 20.10.1981 (ol.1). That was the pedigree pleaded by the

Plaintiff in terms of which the Plaintiff and the pt Defendant gets an undivided Yz share each of

the corpus.

The 2nd and 3rd defendants (hereinafter referred to as "2nd and 3rd Defendants") while admitting

the corpus denied that Rankira was the sole owner and took up the position that Rankira and

Lapaya both owned an undivided Yz share each of the corpus and pleaded a different pedigree to

that of the Plaintiff.

The 4th and 5th defendants (hereinafter referred to as "4th and 5th Defendants") claimed that the

corpus was known as Hitinawatta alias Udaha Hena and admitted the claim of the Plaintiff that it

was at one time owned by Rankira. However, they contested the position of the Plaintiff that

Andirisa was the only child of Rankira and took up the position that Rankira had four children

namely Andirisa, Pinsethuwa, Kira and Singho.

The 5th, 6th and 7th defendants (hereinafter referred to as "5th, 6th and 7th Defendants") claimed

that the corpus was known as Hitinawatta alias Udahawatta of 12 lahas paddy sowing in extent.

They admitted the claim of the Plaintiff that it was at one time owned by Rankira. However, they

contested the position of the Plaintiff that Andirisa was the only child of Rankira and took up the

position that Rankira had four children namely Andirisa, Pinsethuwa, Kira and Singho.

The learned District Judge of Kegalle held that the Plaintifffailed to establish his title to the corpus

and held that Rankira and Lapaya both owned an undivided Yz share each of the corpus. It was

further held that the parties were entitled to the following shares of the corpus:

2nd Defendant undivided 55/120

3rd Defendant undivided 49/120

6th Defendant undivided 2/120

7th defendant undivided 8/120

9th defendant undivided 4/120

10th defendant undivided 2/120

The Plaintiff has filed this appeal against the said judgment of the learned District Judge of Kegalle

and moves that the said judgment be set aside and judgment be entered as prayed for in the

plaint.

Section 25(1) of the Partition Law requires the court to examine the title of each party and hear

and receive evidence in support thereof. It has been consistently held that it is the duty of the

Court to examine and investigate title in a partition action, because the judgement is a judgement

in rem. In Gnanapandithen and another v. Balanayagam and another1 G.P.S. De Silva c.J.

explained this duty as follows:

"Mr. Samarasekera cited several decisions which have, over the years, emphasized the

paramount duty cast on the court by the statute itself to investigate title. It is unnecessary

to repeat those decisions here. For present purposes it would be sufficient to refer to the

case of Mather v. Thamotharam Pillai (2) decided as far back as 1903, where Layard, CJ.

stated the principle in the following term: - "Now, the question to be decided in a partition

suit is not merely matters between parties which may be decided in a civil action; ...

The court has not only to decide the matters in which the parties are in dispute, but to

safeguard the interests of others who are not parties to the suit, who will be bound by

a decree for partition ... "Layard, CJ. stressed the importance of the duty cast on the

court to satisfy itself "that the plaintiff has made out a title to the land sought to be

partitioned, and that the parties before the court are those solely entitled to such land."

(emphasis added). "2

The alleged rights of the Plaintiff and pt Defendant to the corpus flows from Andirisa. Hence the

burden was on the Plaintiff to establish that Andirisa was the only child of Rankira. That was the

case he pleaded. However, during his evidence, he contradicted himself on this issue. Initially he

admitted that Rankira had two children namely Andirisa and Kira (Appeal Brief page 97). Later he

claimed that Rankira had two children namely Kirisanda and Jothia (Appeal Brief page 98).

Thereafter he stated that Rankira had four children (Appeal Brief page 113). He did not reveal

this in his pedigree although he admitted under cross-examination that he was aware of these

facts. He also stated that he had submitted the birth certificate of Andirisa to court when in fact

it was not done. It was also admitted by the Plaintiff that the 2nd, 3rd and 8th Defendants possessed

Y:! share of the corpus for over 40 years which runs contrary to his stated position. His evidence

is contradictory on material points and the learned District Judge was correct in concluding that

the Plaintiff had failed to prove his pedigree in the light of the 2nd and 3rd Defendants strenuously

contending that Rankira did not have a child named Andirisa.

On the other hand, the learned District Judge held that the evidence establishes that the rights

of Rankira had devolved on Pinsethuwa, Kira and Singho and proceeds to allocate shares of the

corpus more or less in accordance with the pedigree pleaded by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants.

Plaintiff himself admitted that Rankira had a child named Kira (Appeal Brief page 97). Several

deeds 28.1 to 28.4 and 38.1 to 38.5 were marked in evidence in support of the pedigree pleaded

by the 2nd and 3rd Defendants. Some of these deeds were executed as early as 1911, 1924, 1929,

1945 and 1969 whereas the only deed marked in evidence by the Plaintiff was executed in 1981.

The learned District Judge has correctly investigated the title in the light of these deeds and oral

evidence.

The Plaintiff sought to raise a question before this court on the non-acceptance of deed of gift

marked 38.3. This is a deed of gift by which Kira gifted his share to the 2nd and 8th Defendants.

The learned counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that it is trite law that for a deed of gift to be valid

it must be accepted by the donee. It was submitted that there been no acceptance it cannot pass

title to the 2nd and 8th Defendants. However as correctly submitted by the learned counsel for 2nd

to 10th Defendants, this is raised for the first time in appeal. No issue on this matter was raised

at the trial. In Somawathie v. Wi/man and others3 the question of non-acceptance of a deed of

gift was raised for the first time in appeal before the High Court of Civil Appeal of the North

Western Province which took cognizance of this issue. In appeal the Supreme Court held that the

High Court was wrong in law in considering the question of non-acceptance of the deed of gift

since there was a failure to raise an issue on that ground in the District Court and to lead any

,

evidence to that effect. Accordingly, the question of non-acceptance of deed of gift 38.3 is not

an issue that can be raised in this appeal.

The learned counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that if the Plaintiff has failed to establish his title

to the corpus, the learned District Judge should have stopped by dismissing the action as the

defendants have not specifically prayed for the partitioning of the land. In Weerakoon et al v.

Waas et al4 it was held that when an action for partition of a land is dismissed on the ground that

the plaintiff has no title to the land, the Court has no jurisdiction to proceed to allot shares among

the defendants if the defendants do not agree to ask for partition. Basnayake c.J. explained the

rationale as follows:

"It would appear from section 2 of the Partition Act, No. 16 of 1951, that an action for

partition can be instituted only by a person to whom a land belongs in common with two

or more persons. The Act creates a special jurisdiction and provides for a special

procedure. Where after trial it appears that the basis on which the action can be brought

is non-existent, the Court cannot make any order other than the dismissal of the action

and any other order which is ancillary to such order. This Court has decided that in an

action under the repealed Partition Ordinance each party to a partition action had the

double capacity of plaintiff and defendant and that he who first brought the action was

taken to be the plaintiff. It has also been held by this Court that in an action under the

same Ordinance where the plaintiff failed to prove his title there was no objection to a

partition among the defendants who had established their title if they so desired it,

because defendants in a partition action are for some purposes in the position of

plaintiffs. The new Act is not different from the old Ordinance in respect of the provisions

under which those decisions have been given and decisions under the repealed Ordinance

can properly be regarded as applicable to the new Act. But in the instant case the

defendant did not agree to ask for a partition."s

I am of the view that this rationale is applicable to the Partition law No. 21 of 1977 as well.

However, in this case the 4th and 5th Defendants have in their statement of claim prayed for an

undivided 1/32 and 1/80 shares respectively of the corpus. The 6th and 7th Defendants have also

prayed for an undivided 1/20 and 1/40 shares respectively of the corpus. In the circumstances

the learned District Judge was correct in ordering partitioning of the corpus even though the

Plaintiff failed to establish his title to it.

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that no evidence was led to establish that

Pinsethuwa was a child of Rankira. However, the death certificate of Pinsethuwa was marked as

781 which shows that Morawaka Wijayasinghalge Rankira was the father of the deceased. The

Plaintiff admitted that the said Rankira was the original owner of the corpus (Appeal Brief page

112).

The learned Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that the learned District Judge failed to give

reasons for her judgment as required by section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code. I am unable to

agree. The judgment contains the reasons for the conclusions set out therein. In any event, the

proviso to Article 138(1) of the Constitution states that no judgment, decree or order of any court

shall be reversed or varied on account of any error, defect or irregularity, which has not

prejudiced the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned a failure of justice. Therefore, even

where there is a failure to comply with Section 187 of the Civil Procedure Code, if it is evident on

a close examination of the totality of the evidence that the learned District Judge is correct in

pronouncing judgment, there is no prejudice to the substantial rights of the parties or occasioned

a failure of justice and the judgment of the learned District Judge should not be disturbed. 6 The

evidence in this case supports the judgment of the learned District Judge.

For the foregoing reasons, I see no reasons to interfere with the judgment of the learned District

Judge of Kegalle.

Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
