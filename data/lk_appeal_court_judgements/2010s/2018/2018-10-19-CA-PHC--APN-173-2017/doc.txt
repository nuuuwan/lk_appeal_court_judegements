The petitioner filed this revision application seeking to set aside the bail order of

the Learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura dated 09.08.2017 in Case No. HC

437/2005.

Facts of the case:

The 1 st Accused-Petitioner (hereinafter referred to as the 'petitioner') was indicted

with another for 22 counts under Section 5 .of the offences against the Public

Property Act and Sections 388 and 467 of the Penal code. The Learned High Court

Judge of Anuradhapura had convicted both the petitioner and the 2nd accused for

their respective charges by order dated 30.03.2017.

Thereafter an application for bail pending appeal was made by wife of the

petitioner under case No. Bai1/27/2017. After considering the submissions, the

Learned High Court Judge of Anuradhapura had dismissed the application by order

dated 16.05.2017 since there were no exceptional circumstances to release the

petitioner on bail.

On 01.08.2017 the Petitioner's wife had filed another bail application before the

same High Court stating that the petitioner was suffering from diabetes .

However the Learned High Court Judge by order dated 09.08.2017 had dismissed

the application without issuing notices to the Respondents stating that the Learned

Judge cannot revise his own order.

Being aggrieved by said dismissal, t~le petitioner has preferred a reVISIOn

application to this court.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner has contended that said order dated

09.08.2017 was illegal, unfair and unjust. Therefore the Learned Counsel averred

Page 3 of7

following grounds as '>~ceptional cire umstances to invoke the revIsIOnary

:jurisdiction of this Court.

a) The Learned High Court Judge i,lad misdirected himself into treating the

I second bail application under 437/2005 as a revision application challenging

the order dated 16.05.2017 of Bail pending application No. 27/20 17,

b) The Learned High Court Judge had prevented the petitioner from

" furnishing true facts concerning the :petitioner's ill health to Court.

In the case of Rasheed Ali V. Mohamed Ali (1981) 2 SLR 29 it was held that,

I "The powers of revision conferred on the Court of Appeal are very wide and

the Court has discretion to exercise them whether an appeal lies or not or

whether an appeal had been taken or not. However this discreFionary

'I remedy can be invoked only where there are exceptional circumstances

warranting the intervention of the cqurt ... "

The Learned SSC raised an objection that petitioner had not tendered the petition

and the affidavit pertaining to the bail application No. Bail 27/17 which is material

to this revision application therefore had not tendered all necessary documents

according to Rule 3 (1) (a) and (b) of the: Court of Appeal [Appellate Procedure]

Rules of 1990. However upon perusal of the brief we find that those two

documents have been attached.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner contended that the Learned High Court

Judge had prevented the petitioner from furnishing true facts concerning the

petitioner's health to Court. However we 0bserve that in the first bail application,

the petitioner's' wife had averred the medi~11 condition of the petitioner that he was

suffering from diabetes. The Learned Counsel for petitioner admitted that

Page 4 of7

petitioner had failed to tender any medical records pertaining to the illness before

High Court.

In the case ofRamu Thamotharampillaa V. Attorney General (2004) 3 Sri. L.R

180, it was held that,

" ... but the illness must be a present illness and that continued incarceration

would endanger life or cause per'l1anent impairment ~f health. Moreover

there must be evidence of the nature of the illness and its effect. "

In the case of Attorney General V. Ediriweera (2006) BLR page 12 it was held

that,

" ... he must additionally show that the illness was not only a present one but

that continued coriflnement would imperil life or cause permanent

impairment of his physical condition ... "

Taking a similar view, the Learned High Court Judge had refused said bail

application since there was no imminent danger to petitioner's life.

It is trite law that there must be a full and'truthful disclosure of facts when seeking

for a discretionary remedy. Therefore it is: the duty of the petitioner to place all the

relevant documents before Court.

In the case of Shanmugawadivu V. Kulathilake (2003) 1 SLR~216, it was held

ili~, '

"The new Rules permit an applicarot to file documents later, ifhe has stated

his inability in filing the relevant documents along with his application, and

had taken steps to seek the leave of the Court tofurnish such documents ... "

We observe that the petitioner had not tendered medical reports with the petition of

Bail Application No. 27117 and had not sought pennission to tender them later.

,

Accordingly we are of the VIew that ":he Learned High Court Judge had not

prevented petitioner from tendering relevant medical records and the petitioner had

ample opportunity to submit the said reports with first bail application. Therefore

we think that the second bail application was filed to cover up the said failure.

The Learned Counsel for the petitioner argued that the Learned High Court Judge

had misdirected himself in treating the second bail application as a revision

application. We are of the view that the vrder dated 16.05.2017 might have been

inevitably revised if the Learned }-Egh Court Judge allowed another bail

application.

The Learned High Court Judge in the order dated 09.08.2017 has held as follows;

"e:J q~D (!h@a; <y($)2:)) if, Z1e-",jenc,.:) e60e-~jW2:n'" 2B8@ ~253", ($)1.2B"'JD25f :>

q82:5)6~'" <y~8e-d e-2:nJ@e)." (Order marked as "P 1 0" in the petition dated

20.11.2017)

We observe that in the case of Hettiarachchi V. Seneviratne, Deputy Bribery

Commissioner and others (1994) 3 Sri L.R. 293, it was held that,

"It is a well-established rule in general a Court cannot re-hear, review,

alter or vary its own judgment once delivered. The rationale of that rule is

that there must be finality to litigation ... "

In the case of Jeyaraj Fernandopulle V. Premachandra Silva and others [1996]

1 SLR 70, it was held that,

"As a general rule, no Court has power to rehear, review, alter or vary any

judgment or order made by it after it has been entered ... "

, ~.

Accordingly the Learned High Court Judge was correct in refusing to entertain

another bail application on the identical grounds for the same petitioner. Further

the Learned High Court Judge had directed prison authorities to treat the petitioner

from any Government hospital if his ilhess could not be treated in the Prison

hospital.

Considering above, we see no reason to revise the order of the Learned High Court

Judge of Anuradhapura dated 09.08.2017.

Therefore the revision application is dismissed without costs.
