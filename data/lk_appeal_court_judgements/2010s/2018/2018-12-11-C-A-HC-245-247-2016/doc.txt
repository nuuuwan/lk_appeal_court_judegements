ACHALA WENGAPPULI J.

The 1st and 3rd Accused-Appellants and the 2nd Accused-Appellant,

in their separate petitions of appeal, seek to set aside their conviction by

the High Court of Kegalle for the murder of Alutwattegedara Samarasinghe

on 31st March 2005 and the imposition of the sentence of death consequent

to that conviction.

Being aggrieved by the said conviction and sentence, the 1st

Accused-Appellant sought to challenge its validity on the basis that the

evidence presented before the trial Court by the prosecution does not

2

support a conclusion that he had entertained a murderous intention, since

only a single stab injury that had been inflicted on the deceased. In relation

to the appeal of the 3rd Accused-Appellant, he sought to challenge his

conviction based on the misapplication of the concept of common intention

by the trial Court. The 2nd Accused-Appellant also challenged his

conviction on the same basis.

In view of these grounds of appeal raised by the three Accused-

Appellants, it is incumbent upon this Court to consider the evidence

presented by the prosecution in support of the charge of murder.

The only eye witness to the incident, 5 riyalatha, is the wife of the

deceased. On the day of the incident, there was a wedding function in a

neighbouring house and the witness and the deceased were helping them

out. The incident took place in the late evening. The deceased was serving

liquor to the guests at this function to which the 1st Accused-Appellant too

was a guest. The deceased had served liquor to him as well. The 1st

Accused-Appellant had enjoyed himself at the function and even played a

musical instrument to entertain the guests.

Late in the evening the deceased left the function to return to his

house in order to take some medication which had to be taken before 10.00

p.m. His wife accompanied him. On their way, they came across a group

of persons consisting of the three Accused-Appellants and another

unidentified person. This was near a pandal erected to welcome the guests

who arrive for the function. It was decorated with light bulbs.

As they were passing the group, the 1st Accused-Appellant grabbed

the deceased from his shirt and said" 63CJ @C)~)C)" and stabbed him on the

3

front of his chest. The 2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants too had held the

deceased by his shoulder. Having received the stab, the deceased fell on

the ground and the witness raised cries for help. The unidentified person

did nothing.

It is stated by the medical officer who performed the post-mortem

examination on the body of the deceased that he had died as a result of a

penetrating stab injury to the ventricle of his heart, which also pierced

right atrium. The medical officer had observed only one stab injury

externally and it was located 8 cm left to the mid line and 2 cm below left

nipple. In his evidence, the medical officer expressed his opinion as this

stab injury is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.

In fact, the deceased was operated on at the hospital, but later

succumbed to his injury in spite of surgical intervention to save his life.

The Police have arrested the three Accused-Appellants who

appeared to have evaded their arrests. A knife was recovered by the

Police, upon the information provided by the 1st Accused-Appellant at his

house and the medical officer was of the view that it could have been used

in the infliction of the external injury observed on the body of the

deceased. The Government Analyst did not identify any blood on its

blade.

In support of his ground of appeal, the 1st Accused-Appellant

contended that there was only a single stab injury was inflicted and

coupled with the admission by the eye witness that he had no prior

animosity with the deceased, there was insufficient evidence to conclude

that he entertained a murderous intention.

4

This submission of the 1st Accused-Appellant, is essentially relies on

the fact that there was only a single stab injury. The intention that could be

gathered from that fact had been considered in several judicial precedents.

Majority of these precedents favours the view that it could be taken as a

consideration that could negate any murderous intention and the

judgment of Weerappan v The Queen 76 N.L.R. 109 is one such oft quoted

authority. However, it is apparent that his Lordships in that instance have

decided to reduce the criminal liability of the appellant to culpable

homicide not amounting to murder from murder upon the basis that there

was no direction to the jury as to the circumstances that were available in

the evidence which" ... might indicate the absence of murderous intention".

On the other hand, the issue whether a single stab injury could

reduce the offence of murder to that of culpable homicide was considered

in the light of the statutory provisions as set out in limb three of Section

294 of the Penal Code by this Court in Farook v Attorney General (2006) 3

Sri L.R. 174. Having noted that the injury caused to the deceased had high

probability of causing death, the Court of Appeal has proceeded to affirm

the conviction for murder adopting reasoning of judgments of the Indian

Supreme Court.

In Somapala v The Queen 72 N.L.R. 121, the Court of Criminal

Appeal, having analysed Sections 293 and 294 of the Penal Code, held

thus:-

" ... while the act of callsing death with knowledge that the act is

likely to mllse death is clllpable homicide, sllch an act is not

mllrder, llnless eitlzer-

5

(a) the offender intends to cause bodily Injury and has the

special knowledge that the intended injury is likely to

cause the death of the person injured, or

(b) the offender knows that, because the act is so

imminently dangerolls, there is the high probability of

causing death or an injury likely to cause death. /I

The single stab injury that had been inflicted by the 1st Accused-

Appellant had penetrated the chest cavity of the deceased, reached his

heart and caused a cut in ventricle. The act of the 1st Accused-Appellant of

grabbing the deceased by his shirt had thrusting a knife deep in to chest

cavity right above his heart is considered in the light of these judicial

precedents, it is reasonable to conclude that the 1st Accused-Appellant has

had the requisite knowledge that he has inflicted an injury so imminently

dangerous and there was high probability of causing death. His utterance

that /I 8>Q @ocgJc)" and prior attack on Asela Bandara (PW3) supports a

conclusion that he was not under the influence of liquor to the degree of

incapacitating him to form a murderous intention (as per Dayaratne v

Republic of Sri Lanka(1990) 2 Sri L.R.226) and upon seeing the deceased,

who was on his way home to take his regular medication, he stabbed him

for no apparent reason.

Therefore, it is our firm view that the conviction of the 1st Accused-

Appellant for the offence of murder by the trial Court is justified and his

appeal ought to be dismissed on that account.

6

In respect of the 2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants, it was submitted

that they did not share a common murderous intention with the 1st

Accused-Appellant. The 2nd Accused-Appellant submitted that evidence

presented by the prosecution even suggests that he may have held the

deceased by his shoulder to protect the deceased from stabbing.

The 3rd Accused-Appellant is the son of the 1st Accused-Appellant.

The 2nd Accused-Appellant had no such relationship either to the deceased

or to the 1st Accused-Appellant. It is clear from the evidence that few

minutes prior to the incident of stabbing of the deceased, when the 1st

Accused-Appellant had attempted to stab witness Asela Bandara, he was

with a group of people. It could well be that the 2nd and 3rd Accused-

Appellants were there with the 1st Accused-Appellant at that time. They

did not do anything. Only the 1st Accused-Appellant showed any

aggression on the witness. There is no evidence that either of these two

Accused-Appellant's had any motive against the deceased.

The incident of stabbing, as described by the wife of the deceased,

happened suddenly with no warning. The words of the 1st Accused-

Appellant itself did not convey any imminent danger. The sequence of the

act of stabbing is that the 1st Accused-Appellant had grabbed the passing

deceased by his shirt and then stabbed him. There is no evidence of a time

gap between the grabbing and stabbing. In this sequence, there is no role

to play for any other person. The witness then claimed that the 2nd and 3rd

Accused-Appellants have held the deceased while the 1st Accused-

Appellant stabbed. No further details were elicited by the prosecution as

to the role played by these two Accused-Appellants prior to the grabbing

and after the act of stabbing.

7

When the evidence presented before the trial Court is considered in

its proper perspective in the light of above considerations, it appears that

the 2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants may have held the deceased only after

the act of stabbing. Even if they have held him while the act of stabbing,

that fact alone is not sufficient to satisfy the burden on the prosecution to

prove beyond reasonable doubt that these two Accused-Appellants were

actuated by a common murderous intention with the doer of the act when

it failed to place sufficient evidence to establish that there is " ... evidence,

direct or circumstantial, either of pre arrangement, or a pre-arranged plan,

or a declaration showing common intention, or some other significant fact

at the time of the commission of the offence", which enable the trial Court

to " ... conclude that the co accused had the common intention with the

doer of the act, and not merely the same or similar intention entertained

independently of each other" as per the judgment of the Court of Criminal

Appeal in The King v Asappu 50 N.L.R. 324.

There is no evidence led before the trial Court to exclude the

possibility of intervention to prevent the attack, as claimed by the 2nd

Accused-Appellant before this Court. The resultant position is that the

evidence presented by the prosecution is clearly insufficient to impute

criminal liability on the 2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants under Section 32 of

the Penal Code for the commission of murder beyond reasonable doubt

that thev entertained common murderous intention. In these J

circumstances, we hold that there is merit in the ground of appeal

presented. by the 2nd and 3rd Accused-Appellants and their appeals are

therefore entitled to sllcceed.

8

In view of the above, we make the following orders;

1. The conviction of the 1st Accused-Appellant and his sentence is

affirmed by dismissing his appeal.

2. The conviction and sentence imposed on the 2nd and 3rd Accused-

Appellants are set aside by allowing their appeal.
